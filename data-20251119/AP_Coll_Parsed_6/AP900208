doctors at johns hopkins hospital will be 
randomly tested for alcohol and drugs under a policy initiated by 
the physicians themselves the hospital said thursday 
hopkins was believed to be the first hospital in the country to 
adopt such a policy for physicians 
dr hamilton moses iii the hospitals vice president for 
medical affairs said the policy will take effect in july twenty 
percent to 50 percent of the 750 doctors who are up for 
reappointment then would be randomly selected for tests to 
determine if they have used alcohol tranquilizers cocaine or 
other drugs he said 
we dont know the precise number and weve not actually 
devised the precise protocol that we will be using but we expect 
to screen somewhere between a quarter and a half of the medical 
staff every other year moses said 
under the policy doctors who test positive for drugs or alcohol 
would be tested a second time after a second positive test they 
would be evaluated and if necessary sent for rehabilitation 
hospital spokeswoman joann rodgers said 
onlyif the doctor is not successfully rehabilitated would 
he be dismissed or removed from the staff moses said 
objections to our plan have been raised moses said not 
every person perceives there is a need to do it and not everyone on 
the staff believes its appropriate to be this heavyhanded 
officials with the american hospital association and american 
medical association said they were unaware of any hospital 
instituting such a policy for doctors 
there are hospitals who do testing on employees and it is 
common to have for cause kinds of drug tests but no one here is 
aware of a regular community or acute care hospital that tests 
physicians said mary babich spokewoman for the american hospital 
association 
the american medical associations policy on drug testing of 
doctors is under review a spokesman said thursday 
nonclinical faculty at hopkins who dont care directly for 
patients are exempt from random testing testing for them and 
others in the school of medicine is under review rodgers said 
doctors and other hospital workers such as nurses and 
technicians are subject to a threeyearold policy that requires 
tests if supervisors believe an employees work has been impaired 
by drugs or alcohol rodgers said 
all physicians involved in direct patient care most of whom are 
up for reappointment after two years will be tested every two 
years rodgers said 
everybody eventually will be tested probably within the 
twoyear time period after that everybody will be tested each 
time they come up for credentialing or renewal she said 
hopkins has a medical staff of 1500

with the wrecking ball just off stage left the 
curtain is going down on little jack horner jokes and magic home 
for half a century to pranksters clowns and vaudevillian wannabees 
little jack horners regulars say they are losing an informal 
clubhouse and that boston is losing a little bit of its heart 
people come in here not just to shop said owner fred 
lezburg weve got second and thirdgeneration customers who 
remember coming here as kids 
and of course there are the characters 
we get a lot of them lezburg says 
there are those who wander in to check out the pranks designed 
for an adult audience or the groups of giggling young women who 
come in on their lunch break looking for just the right prop for a 
bachelorette party 
but lezburg says the clowns who are not the biggest spenders 
but regular and fun will probably end up the hardest hit 
theyll have to look elsewhere for their oversized scissors rubber 
noses and other crowdpleasers 
gone too will be the inflatable wayne newton dolls whoopie 
cushions and exploding cigars say goodbye to the rubber chickens 
and counterfeit cockroaches things that squirt and pop out of cans 
say goodbye as a matter of fact to an entire block of one of 
bostons most colorful little streets which runs down the hill 
from the state capitol building the buildings owner wants to put 
a new face on the street tear down the building and put up an 
office tower 
also caught up in the change will be bromfield streets hat 
cleaning and shine where a customer could get a good shine for a 
buck or so and where theyd even put new heels on your shoes if 
you wanted to wait a few minutes also affected are a flower shop 
and a jeweler specializing in pawn 
they want a bigger better higher building said lezburg a 
reformed accountant who took over the business nearly five 
years ago and i guess we dont fit into the picture 
the picture in downtown boston has changed a lot in recent 
years rundown blocks are revitalized while the fabled strip joints 
and back alley bars of the nearby combat zone fade slowly from 
the scene 
and as often is the case the momandpop stores that dotted 
narrow streets are giving way to bigger stores and office buildings 
this street has become a dead end lezburg said wednesday 
and its too bad because this is a place that a lot of people 
look to as being the high point of their day 
starting today the prices on lezburgs stock were going to be 
slashed when the skyhigh shelves lined with rubber likenesses of 
everyone from ronald reagan to horror movie character freddie 
krueger are cleared the city will have only one joke store on 
which to rely jacks joke shop 
founded in 1922 it claims to be the nations oldest active joke 
shop 
im quite sure that down the line people will come into my 
shop and ask where did little jack horners go said harold 
bengin who took over jacks joke shop from his fatherinlaw 
and sadly ill have to say theyve gone out of business its 
tough for the little guy in todays economy 
until about two weeks ago lezburg had been trying to find a 
place to relocate but hes paying about 20 a square foot on 
bromfield street and prices like that have gone the way of his 
hardtofind 200 planet of the apes mask and besides lezburg has 
gone through this before and isnt convinced it wouldnt happen 
again 
in 1986 he was forced out of little jack horners original site 
around the corner near boston common to make way for a condominium 
project 
this is the kind of store that lends itself to laughter and 
im trying to keep that up on the outside lezburg said but on 
the inside im not doing as well i put my heart into this thing 
and im coming up empty and disappointed terribly disappointed

nelson mandela endured harsh 
treatment for many years and remains a prisoner but now he lives 
in a large comfortable home and meets government ministers to 
discuss the end of white rule 
mandela often described as the worlds most famous prisoner 
occupies a white ranchstyle house with a swimming pool at the 
victor verster prison which is set among the vineyards of the 
winterberg mountains 
he and president fw de klerk have become the critical figures 
in efforts for a peaceful resolution of south africas long racial 
conflict 
in a speech feb 2 de klerk promised to free mandela 71 and 
legalized the african national congress and more than 60 other 
banned groups fighting south africas policy of racial separation 
or apartheid 
government ministers visit mandela regularly to prepare for 
talks on ending white rule and sharing power with blacks 
many blacks call mandela the father of the nation and he 
has assumed almost mythical status as a leader and a man many 
countrymen see him as the ultimate president and even the whiteled 
government appears to deal with him as an equal 
the government that has imprisoned him for more than 27 years 
now hopes mandela will help solve the nations problems by acting 
as a mediator between the administration and its opponents 
mandela one of south africas first black lawyers was arrested 
and jailed in 1962 two years later he was convicted of leading 
the anc sabotage campaign against the government and sentenced to 
life in prison 
living at victor verster prison is much different from the 
privations mandela suffered at the notorious prison on robben 
island off cape town 
people who have visited him say his house has three bedrooms a 
study medical examination room and swimming pool and is 
surrounded by red and yellow flowers a deputy prison commander 
occupied the house before it was assigned to mandela about a year 
ago 
he rises daily at 330 am and exercises for two hours 
including lifting weights skipping rope and doing pushups 
according to press reports after that he spends most of the day 
studying reading a stream of newspapers and periodicals and 
following the news on radio and television 
a small staff of white guards prepares his food and attends to 
his needs the reports say the house is under heavy security 
surrounded by razor wire and watchtowers 
regular visits are permitted and mandela uses the mail and a 
prison fax machine to communicate with colleagues and friends at 
home and abroad 
more than half south africas 37 million people were born while 
he was in prison no one but guards and visitors has seen or heard 
him in that time 
supporters and even some opponents praise mandela for his 
courage and dedication during nearly three decades in prison 
hes certainly a leader of stature said constitutional 
development minister gerrit viljoen who has been meeting with 
mandela 
the rev allan boesak an antiapartheid leader of mixed race 
who met mandela for the first time tuesday called him a great man 
waiting to lead the nation 
a man of superior intelligence a great strategist was the 
way boesak described him 
people who have seen mandela say he is remarkably lacking in 
bitterness about the hard years of breaking stone and building 
roads on robben island men jailed with him said he fought for 
prisoner rights and refused to be cowed by the authorities 
a recent biography by a longtime friend said mandela suffered 
greatly from loneliness and sometimes despaired 
the worst part of imprisonment is being locked up by 
yourself mandela was quoted as saying you come facetoface 
with time and there is nothing more terrifying than to be alone 
with sheer time 
what mandela plans for south africa when he is free remains 
unclear and visitors and other sources disagree about it 
boesak said mandela had not changed his principles including 
the desire for a oneman onevote democracy with no special status 
for any group 
other reports claim mandela is a pragmatist who accepts that 
white rule must end gradually with many safeguards for minorities 
close friends and aides often refuse to talk about mandela and 
the future saying he alone can answer those questions

in power seven months sudans national 
salvation revolution has done little to revive a collapsing economy 
or end a debilitating civil war that has killed hundreds of 
thousands and threatens more with starvation 
the war is getting worse despite optimistic official talk of an 
approaching military victory 11 southern towns have fallen to 
rebels in recent weeks and the souths largest city juba is 
teetering under siege 
the sudan peoples liberation army led by a renegade colonel 
john garang launched its rebellion against the moslemdominated 
government in 1983 demanding economic and political autonomy for 
the predominantly christian and animist in the countrys southern 
half 
seven years of war have aggravated conditions in sudan africas 
largest country what was once considered a potential breadbasket 
is an economic basket case after 34 years of independence 
sudan still cant make payments on foreign debts of more than 
13 billion it has been ineligible for loans from the 
international monetary fund since 1986 and is in arrears to the 
world bank and most of its western and arab creditors 
meanwhile sudanese wonder whether their nation will become an 
islamic state reviving laws that sever thieves hands and lash 
people who drink alcohol 
sudanese intellectuals and foreign diplomats say the young 
officers of the 15member ruling junta most are in their 30s 
apparently yield major decisions to a 40member council or majlis 
in traditional islam dominated by the fundamentalist national 
islamic front 
they say lt gen omar hassan elbashir the leader of the 
junta vacillates between radical front members and more moderate 
forces 
the brigadiers justified overthrowing prime minister sadek 
elmahdis civilian regime june 30 by pointing out that multiparty 
democracy had failed to end the long war or save the shattered 
economy 
their most visible accomplishment has been a spruceup job on 
khartoum the capital 
rundown roundabouts and squares have been prettied up with 
flowers and gleaming tiles streets are cleaned regularly although 
potholes remain shop facades are painted white with bright green 
shutters 
on the outside things look changed said a sudanese woman 
who like many in elbashirs sudan refused to speak for 
attribution the streets are clean the squares have flowers the 
shops are newly painted 
but the shelves are bare so even if you have money you cant 
buy anything 
the shoppainting gives an insight into the state of the country 
today the choice of green usually considered the color of islam 
fueled rumors that most junta members sympathize with the national 
islamic front 
disbanding the front and other political parties and trade 
unions was among the juntas first acts 
on wednesday elbashir said he would soon announce the 
formation of a oneparty system that would be open to all sudanese 
the front and other political parties remain banned but 
diplomats say its clear that supporters of the islamic front are 
in control 
one diplomat said his embassy learned that elbashir had planned 
on jan 1 independent sudans 34th anniversary to declare an 
islamic state he planned to restore harshly interpreted islamic 
laws or sharia originally imposed in 1983 by former military 
strongman gafaar nimeiri but now largely ignored the diplomat said 
the diplomat said elbashir was dissuaded from the move by 
president hosni mubarak of egypt sudans powerful northern 
neighbor on a quick new years eve visit to khartoum 
the governments public position is that even if sharia were 
enforced nonislamic regions could exempt themselves unlike the 
practice under nimeiri his insistence on nationwide sharia 
exacerbated the rebellion that had begun several months earlier 
and its existence as the basic law continues to fuel the battle 
between the mainly nonmoslem black southerners and the arab 
moslemdominated administration 
the southern civil war still costs the economy 1 million a day 
while causing famine that has killed hundreds of thousands and 
threatens as many more 
elbashir recently spoke of approaching victory over the enemy 
of 30000 trained bush fighters and 20000 irregulars who have 
fared no worse than a standoff for seven years 
the war recently intensified after a lull last year which 
allowed relief to be ferried to desperate civilians but also 
permitted rearming by both sides peace talks are suspended 
indefinitely 
such developments largely because of both sides intransigence 
have triggered protests from the united states egypt and other 
european and arab allies of sudan 
allegations by the londonbased amnesty international and others 
of human rights abuses also have elicited complaints from 
aidgiving countries of the west 
the government denies the charges but diplomats in khartoum say 
one of the major decisions the elbashir government left to the 
islamic majlis was the handling of political prisoners it approved 
torture diplomats allege 
the junta has cowed the opposition after sentencing a doctor to 
death for leading a strike by physicians a sentence elbashir 
reportedly commuted later threats of labor action are no longer 
heard especially intimidated have been the trade unions and 
professional organizations whose strikes and civil unrest brought 
down three previous sudanese governments

fat tags are showing in georgia and its 
going to cost those who want to shed the label 
some drivers issued license plates with the prefix fat are 
complaining about driving around with the word bolted to the tail 
end of the family wheels 
officials say theres one way to get rid of fat a replacement 
plate which costs 2 to 8 
about 900 of the plates from fat101 to fat999 have been 
distributed in the athens area as georgia changes its license plate 
design this year 
i had one lady who said she was literally sick over it because 
shes overweight and she had such a hangup about it anyway and 
having to go out with a tag that says fat on her car would be 
just horrible said nancy denson clarke county tax commissioner 
and license tag agent 
she said about 50 people have complained 
maj david camp of the clarke county police department said a 
dozen fat plates have been reported as somehow lost or 
stolen falsely reporting such a thing is illegal he said but 
added that prosecution would be unlikely in this case 
clint moye director of the state revenue departments motor 
vehicle division said fat may join about 100 other letter 
combinations already blacklisted but not until a new plate is 
issued again in 1995

the communist party leadership has blazed the way 
to a brave new world of soviet politics where it will be forced to 
compete with other parties and people will directly choose the 
nations leader for the first time 
there will be a multiparty system there will be a normal 
democracy is how communist party member svyatoslav fyodorov a 
noted eye surgeon approvingly summed up a threeday meeting of the 
partys central committee which voted wednesday to end the partys 
legal monopoly on power 
the decisions wont assume force of law until they are adopted 
by the soviet legislative system a process that could begin next 
week 
they are the boldest steps yet in president mikhail s 
gorbachevs campaign to get the party he heads out of the 
daytoday business of running the country and provide greater 
freedom for political action 
a central committee source said the platform approved wednesday 
calls for a president elected by the people instead of the congress 
of peoples deputies or another legislative body a revolutionary 
transformation for soviet politics 
that would allow gorbachev to bypass the moscow bureaucracy and 
take his case directly to the people 
the party does not assume full government authority vice 
president anatoly i lukyanov told a news conference called to 
explain the new platform which was to be published later its 
role is to be a political leader with no particular role to be 
included in the constitution 
following the lead of its fraternal parties in eastern europe 
the soviet party will propose repeal of its constitutionally 
guaranteed monopoly on power lukyanov said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher praised the vote as a 
great decision but added there was a lot still to be done 
president bush made no direct reference to the vote but credited 
gorbachev for handling some extraordinarily complicated internal 
problems with a certain restraint and finesse that i think 
demonstrates a real commitment to peaceful change 
gorbachev has been struggling for nearly five years to transform 
the soviet union into a modern democracy to save the badly ailing 
economy and to keep the union from dissolving under the weight of 
nationalist upheaval 
his new proposals are unlikely to bring about the rapid collapse 
of communist power 
unlike eastern europe where alternative political groups have 
been at least marginally active for years and sprang quickly into 
genuine opposition parties during last years peaceful revolutions 
the soviet union has no nationwide alternative to the communists 
the party also holds uncounted financial resources and controls 
much of the nations press from pravda the partys flagship 
daily to smallcirculation tabloids printed for reindeer herders 
in siberia it has long held veto power on appointments to 
important jobs on every level 
the vast majority of soviets now living have never known 
anything but communist party rule established after the 1917 
revolution swept the czar from power voters are unlikely to 
immediately oust the communists from control except in a few 
regions such as the independenceminded baltic republics where 
there are strong local political movements 
we communists are not going to surrender our positions just 
like any party in the world we shall be waging a struggle for our 
rights politburo member vitaly i vorotnikov told a group of 
brazilian legislators in remarks reported by the official tass news 
agency 
fellow politburo member alexander n yakovlev a close gorbachev 
ally told the news conference he hopes new parties will share the 
socialist ideal but he said the adopted platform calls for banning 
only groups that condone ethnic strife or violent overthrow of the 
government 
the actual constitutional change must be approved by the supreme 
soviet legislature which opens its next session on wednesday and 
by the congress which is to meet this spring but could be called 
into special session 
at its last meeting in december the congress heeded gorbachevs 
plea for delay and blocked an effort by reformers to strike the 
communists leading role from the constitution 
the issue achieved greater urgency after lithuanias communists 
broke with moscow later that month and formed a new party 
gorbachev dropped his public opposition to alternative political 
parties just three weeks ago so it was a surprise when he proposed 
monday that the possibility should be put into law 
gorbachev packed the meeting of the 249member central committee 
with more than 700 other officials many of them progressives who 
took the floor to demand radical reform 
in two votes first by the central committee and then by the 
entire assembly there was only one no vote maverick 
communist boris n yeltsin who had favored an even more radical 
program demanding a virtual apology by the party for decades of 
totalitarian rule the central committee source said 
the committee also agreed to advance the start of the next party 
congress from october to june for the first time delegates to the 
congress the most powerful party body will be elected by the 
nations 20 million communists previously they were approved by 
the leadership thus ensuring the status quo 
congress then will elect a new central committee and could 
either choose the party leader now gorbachev or allow the 
rankandfile to choose yakovlev said 
the central committee is considered by reformers to be the 
bastion of conservatives wary of gorbachevs reform program and the 
congress would offer gorbachev another chance to reform the 
committee to his liking 
the committee scolded lithuanias communist party for declaring 
independence from moscow and backed a small group of lithuanian 
communists who remain loyal to the kremlin 
lithuanian officials said the break was a precursor to secession 
by the baltic republic and said it was necessary for them to 
prevent defeat in local elections feb 24

the army in an embarrassing admission is 
taking back combat infantryman badges from 14 wounded soldiers who 
were mistakenly granted the coveted awards within days of their 
involvement in the panama invasion 
some of the awards were incorrectly bestowed because the wounded 
men were still under sedation when the medals were pinned to their 
pillows and couldnt be queried about their duties during operation 
just cause according to army spokesman maj joe padilla 
gen carl vuono the army chief of staff awarded the medals 
during a visit to two military hospitals in san antonio texas on 
dec 22 
the chief of staff awarded 186 medals such as combat infantry 
badges and purple hearts during his time at the hospitals 
padilla said 
there were 14 noninfantry soldiers awarded the cib in 
operation just cause however the awards have since been withdrawn 
and the affected soldiers notified padilla said 
although the awards apparently were given with some haste and 
without the usual review the spokesman said the decision was not 
made to grant the medals just for publicitys sake 
this was not a photo op for gen vuono padilla said this 
was an honest mistake 
it was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be 
decorated by the chief of staff of the army it was an effort 
to distinguish those soldiers thought to be deserving and allow 
those who were wounded to wake up with the award on their pillow 
padilla said 
a pool of reporters was permitted to accompany vuono to wilford 
hall medical center for the presentation of medals to just three 
soldiers the general also visited nearby brooke army medical 
center 
the combat infantryman badge is granted only to officers or 
enlisted personnel with specific infantry specialties who have 
satisfactorily performed their duty in an infantry unit while 
it has engaged in combat padilla said 
the purple heart is awarded to members of the armed forces 
wounded or killed in action 
a formal review of the cib awards found 14 were incorrectly 
given to soldiers who werent infantrymen or did not have infantry 
specialties padilla said 
the badges had been granted to men who were military policemen 
artillery soldiers communications specialists truck drivers and 
specialists in psychological operations the spokesman said 
the soldiers that were incorrectly awarded the cib were part 
of the initial 236 wounded soldiers evacuated out of panama during 
the first 48 hours of operation just cause padilla said 
because of time constraints the personnel records werent 
available to verify the eligibility of each soldier he said a 
decision was made to give the wounded soldiers the benefit of the 
doubt regarding the award of the cib pending a final review of 
eligibility it was during this review that the incorrectly awarded 
cibs were discovered 
the spokesman said he didnt think a soldier would be 
disappointed when he awoke and found he wasnt eligible 
every soldier knows what awards theyre eligible for they 
would know immediately that was a mistake he said 
the medals have been the source of some controversy in recent 
weeks because the women who came under fire in panama will be 
ineligible for the award since they are barred under army policy 
from serving in infantry units 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has demanded that women who came 
under fire during operation just cause be granted the medal despite 
the restriction 
the threeinch badges portray a silver rifle on a blue 
background emblazoned with a wreath

bobbi bloks voice is barely above a whisper 
as she tries to explain why she hasnt eaten any food in more than 
five weeks she appears somewhat disoriented and apologizes for 
allowing her thoughts to wander and being unable to express herself 
clearly 
blok 36 views her fast from jan 1 to feb 14 as her share 
of the war against drugs 
the problems facing children and the family in the country 
are at a crisis situation and drugs are the reason says blok 
executive director of a child advocacy group the washington child 
development center something has got to be done 
blok is drinking only a glass of grape juice in the morning and 
water through the rest of the day the purpose of the fast is 
twofold to bring about a local and national drug summit and to 
get the government to increase funding to battle the drug problem 
at the social level not in law enforcement 
blok plans to end her fast on valentines day because she 
believes this country has a heart 
she said she is grateful she was cleansing herself when 
washington mayor marion barry was arrested for possession of 
cocaine on jan 18 blok a senior campaign aide for barry in 1986 
said she never saw barry use drugs 
he did however have the symptoms of a drug user she said 
i made it clear to the mayor that i felt he needed help she 
said it was three days before christmas here was the mayor a 
friend who needed help and rather than confronting him i had 
been accepting his lessthanadequate explanations of his 
activities 
barry had all the classic forms of denial in that he was 
saying one thing and doing another he had his priorities 
distorted and i blame drugs she added 
so far her hunger strike has not brought about the government 
policy changes she seeks but blok says she remains undaunted and 
doesnt believe she has starved herself for nothing 
im losing my stamina but in terms of my resolve and my 
commitment its never been stronger she said in an interview 
tuesday i feel like theres a reason im doing this if only to 
even strengthen my belief in knowing that an individual has the 
power to deal with the problems that face our society 
i do not feel as if ive been ignored i realize that im 
risking my life that cant be denied but ive gotten to the 
point where i cant sit still and watch our elected officials deny 
that there is a drug epidemic 
she has asked her physician not to tell her how much weight she 
has lost and she is undergoing a blood test at least once a week 
blok said she started the fast after learning of a drugrelated 
killing at an unlicensed child care center a few days later while 
she was working as a substitute at a day care center she overheard 
3yearold children talking about drugs the police and guns 
i have to believe that people care about this blok said 
i also believe that our president cares but what good is reading 
his lips if theres no substance to what he says something has got 
to be done about this drug situation the real victims of the 
drug war are our children

an epidemic of delays and baggage problems are 
plaguing the nations airlines but theyre getting fewer 
complaints according to a government report 
ontime performance for december dipped to 702 percent from the 
78 percent reported in november the transportation department air 
travel consumer report said wednesday 
the worst previous showing was in january 1988 when 692 percent 
of flights were reported on time 
the department blamed heavy holiday travel and severe winter 
weather in some parts of the country for service disruptions at the 
nations largest airports delays due to mechanical problems are 
not included in the report 
mishandled baggage complaints filed against the carriers nearly 
doubled from 699 per 1000 passengers in november to 1278 per 
1000 passengers in december it was the worst month since the 
department began reporting airline performance two years ago 
complaints for 1989 totalled 12403 which was about half the 
number received in 1988 
continuing the downward trend december complaints totalled 749 
down 33 percent from the 1125 logged in november and the lowest 
since december 1989 when there were 733

republican sens bill armstrong of colorado 
jesse helms of north carolina and malcolm wallop of wyoming 
received the top 100 score from the american conservative union in 
its rating of the first session of the 101st congress 
they 100 scores meant those three toed the conservative line on 
two dozen votes in 1989 covering defense foreign policy taxation 
spending and social issues 
the higher the rating given by the acu the closer the lawmaker 
voted along the conservative path 
there were also eight 100s among house members all of them 
republicans reps phil crane of illinois bill dannemeyer of 
calif jim hansen of utah wally herger of california john hiler 
of indiana john kasich of ohio clarence miller of ohio and don 
ritter of pennsylvania 
democrats patrick leahy of vermont and spark matsunaga of hawaii 
had the only zeros in the senate matsunaga missed seven of the 24 
votes because of health problems 
twelve senators all democrats had ratings below 10 alan 
cranston of california christopher dodd of connecticut paul 
sarbanes and barbara mikulski of maryland edward m kennedy of 
massachusetts frank lautenberg of new jersey daniel patrick 
moynihan of new york howard metzenbaum of ohio claiborne pell of 
rhode island tom daschle of south dakota jim sasser of tennessee 
and brock adams of washington 
the acu said wednesday that as a whole congress is moving 
toward the center with the senate becoming somewhat more 
conservative and the house slightly more liberal 
the house has 257 democrats and 175 republicans there are three 
vacancies the senate has 55 democrats and 45 republicans 
comparing this years charts with those from the last few 
years we find a slight shift toward the center by both parties in 
both houses acu executive director daniel l casey said 
its probably too early to say whether this is a result of a 
kinder and gentler bush congressional relations policy or more 
reflective of a fundamental shift in the nationwide political 
climate he said 
the average rating of the senate in 1989 was 46 percent 
compared with 43 percent in 1988 and 40 percent in 1987 the 
average rating of the house was 43 percent in 1989 compared with 
44 percent in 1988 and 37 percent in 1987 
the acu founded in 1964 says it is the nations oldest 
conservative lobbying group

during the communist party central committee that 
saw the party relinquish its constitutional monopoly on power 
soviet leaders engaged in impassioned debate about their countrys 
future here are some key quotes 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the party will only be able to fulfill the mission of 
political vanguard if it drastically restructures itself masters 
the art of political work in the presentday conditions and 
succeeds in cooperating with all forces committed to perestroika 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
 
this plenum is the last chance for the party this is also 
gorbachevs last chance either he acts or he loses us moscow 
parliamentarian and reformer boris yeltsin who cast the only vote 
against gorbachevs platform apparently because it was not radical 
enough 
 
we cannot rule out the emergence of new parties but we 
communists are not going to surrender our positions politburo 
member vitaly i vorotnikov 
 
all unanimously think it has become obsolete it has no 
meaning central committee member vladimir p anishchev 
responding to a question about the communist partys future 
 
gorbachevs program is leading to a point where the party as 
such is falling by the political wayside valentin k mesyats 
oldguard party boss of the moscow region 
 
it is too late to discuss whether the country needs a 
multiparty system or not it is a fait accompli prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov 
 
it has become fashionable to blame all our disasters on the 
past but what we are facing now is not the result of yesterdays 
stagnation but of perestroika vladimir brovikov soviet 
ambassador to poland 
 
without having devised a transition plan or new methods of 
party work in the economic sector we began to callously reject 
everything from the past including much that could still be 
useful yegor k ligachev leading orthodox politburo member 
 
we must move with the tide must move with the people and not 
be left behind by events gennadi i gerasimov foreign 
ministry spokesman 
 
we are still hostages to a few dozen dogmatic members of the 
central committee who represent no one aleksandr s tsipko 
former central committee adviser writing in a recent issue of 
moscow news 
 
it has been destroyed by the will of peoples who wished no 
longer to tolerate coercion foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze rejecting assertions that liberalization was to blame 
for the toppling of communist regimes in eastern europe

nonwhite americans were more interested than 
whites in bostons charles stuart murder case the arrest of 
washington mayor marion barry and the mcmartin child abuse 
acquittal according to a survey of interest in the news 
among all people white and nonwhite the crash of an avianca 
airlines plane on long island topped the monthly interest index of 
the times mirror center for the people and the press 
news of the crash of the colombian airliner in which more than 
70 people died was followed closely by 33 percent of those 
surveyed 
among nonwhites however 31 percent paid close attention to 
the avianca crash compared with 44 percent for the story of 
stuart who took his life amid allegations that he had murdered his 
wife and tried to blame it on a black man 
twentyseven percent of whites followed the stuart story 
closely and that case was more interesting to women than to men by 
34 percent to 23 percent 
overall the case was second in interest with 29 percent 
followed by 28 percent for barrys arrest on a drug charge and 27 
percent for the acquittal of the owners of the mcmartin day care 
center in california 
since the survey of 1245 adults is subject to a 3 percent 
error the stuart barry and mcmartin stories were virtually tied 
among nonwhites the arrest of washingtons black mayor on a 
drug charge attracted the close interest of 41 percent compared 
with 26 percent for whites the mcmartin story also held more 
interest for nonwhites than for whites 36 percent to 26 percent 
news of nelson mandelas impending release from jail in south 
africa was of close interest to 26 percent of nonwhites compared 
with only 9 percent of whites 
however since that story erupted in the midst of interviewing 
for the february index there are too few respondents who were 
asked to rate their attention to south africa to enable a reliable 
test of the significance of the racial difference in interest 
times mirror said 
the center said there have only been 11 stories since it 
started the surveys in 1986 in which news interest has been 
affected by race others included the letter bombings of federal 
judges elections of black political leaders and racial violence in 
virginia beach va 
the study also said 22 percent of americans followed the super 
bowl professional football game very closely and six out of 10 
watched it on television four out of 10 watched president bushs 
state of the union address 
forty percent of those surveyed could identify barry as 
washingtons mayor 56 percent knew mandela was an imprisoned black 
leader in south africa 
times mirror is a los angelesbased media company that publishes 
the los angeles times newsday and new york newsday the baltimore 
sun newspapers the hartford courant national journal and 
broadcasting magazine among other journals it also engages in 
broadcasting and cable television book publishing and specialized

the bush administration wants congress to set 
some time limits on how long a borrower can remain a customer of 
the farmers home administration 
under the administrations 1990 farm bill proposals sent to 
capitol hill this week direct fmha farm operating loans would be 
limited to seven years if the borrower also had a bank loan 
guaranteed by the agency that could add another 10 years of 
eligibility making an effective limit of 17 years 
theres no time limit now fmha spokeswoman marlyn aycock 
said wednesday no limit on the number of loans or on how many 
times you can come back for another loan 
the borrowing deadlines are part of an overall package of 
reforms the administration wants congress to approve for fmha an 
agriculture department agency which for many years has been known 
as the governments lender of last resort 
only those who have been denied loans by banks and other 
commercial institutions are eligible for fmha financing 
the proposal calls for a continued swing by the agency to 
guaranteed loans and away from direct fmha financing a trend that 
has prevailed for some years direct loans reached the 
billiondollar level in 1982 and then peaked at 47 billion in 
fiscal 1985 
for the last two years fmha direct farm operating loans have 
been around 900 million annually the bush budget proposed for the 
1991 fiscal year that will begin oct 1 includes 500 million for 
direct loans 
the administration also wants to restrict fmha direct operating 
loans to existing borrowers and to beginners who would become 
operators for the first time those could not have more than 
100000 in loans outstanding at any one time compared with the 
current limit of 200000 
meanwhile fmha guaranteed loan availability has risen from a 
negligible level in the early 1980s to 215 billion in 1988 and 
26 billion in 1989 
the administration also is seeking curbs on abuses under the 
agricultural credit act of 1987 including 250000 limits on debt 
writedowns and writeoffs there are no such limits now and some 
borrowers have had milliondollar writeoffs 
at a news conference announcing the administration proposals 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the fmha has tilted 
toward the grant side in recent years 
weve gone a long way from its original purposed of being a 
source of credit of last resort for farmers and youve got a whole 
variety of ways that have made it very nearly a grant program in 
many of it attributes he said the result of that is that it 
has cost the department and the american taxpayer a great deal of 
money 
the proposal for fmha also would tighten the direct farm 
ownership loan program by limiting new loans to socially 
disadvantaged applicants and impose a 150000 loan limit

the landmark 1986 tax overhaul is forcing 
americans to pay billions of dollars of taxes they had been 
evading but the law is getting low marks for simplification 
despite attempts at making things simpler says fred t goldberg 
jr commissioner of the internal revenue service the law is 
imposing an unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our system of 
tax administration he advised a new watchword do it simple 
rep bill archer of texas senior republican on the house ways 
and means committee told a hearing wednesday that as a lawyer and 
17year member of the panel he has always prided himself on doing 
his own tax return last year i could not do it he said 
for the most part however witnesses praised the impact of the 
new law the most thorough overhaul of the income tax since it was 
enacte in 1913 
goldberg ticked off several benefits 
the requirement that all children 4 and older since reduced to 
2 and older have social security numbers has brought in more than 
2 billion the requirement saw 7 million children dropped as 
dependents on tax returns research reflects the fact that those 
dependents never existed in the first place goldberg said 
repeal or reduction of several deductions generated billions 
of dollars in compliance revenues by removing the opportunity to 
overstate itemized deductions these changes caused more than 8 
million taxpayers to stop itemizing and resulted in tax increases 
for many despite the new laws reduction in tax rates 
tax reform 86 brought an end to the mass marketing of 
abusive tax shelters goldberg said an estimated 10 billion of 
partnership losses reported on 1987 returns were disallowed by the 
irs because of new rules 
while the bush administration was endorsing further 
simplification it also was repeating president bushs call for 
restoring a special break for capital gains a move that many 
experts say could bring even more complexity 
under the 1986 law capital gains which are profits from the 
sale of stock and other investments are fully taxed at the same 
rates applying to wages one of bushs top priorities is restoring 
that break on grounds it is needed to increase investment 
kenneth w gideon assistant secretary of the treasury for tax 
policy told the committee that despite gloomy predictions at the 
time the law was passed there is no clear evidence that the 1986 
act affected the level of investment one way or another 
the predicted shortrun decrease in aggregate equipment 
investment has apparently failed to materialize gideon said for 
whatever reason he added such investment has actually 
experienced a post1986act surge as a result of technologydriven 
increases and expenditures on office computing and accounting 
machinery and an increased growth in output demanded by other 
sectors of the economy 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee said 
deficit reduction is needed to improve the economy rather than 
enactment of special tax breaks 
among other judgments on the 1986 act 
the tradeoff of certain credits and deductions for lower 
statutory rates has had a positive effect on economic growth 
said harry sullivan senior vice president of the food marketing 
institute speaking for a coalition that includes 100 of the 
fortune 500 corporations 
while praising the law for removing 6 million lowerincome 
people from the tax rolls william lucy secretarytreasurer of the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees said 
its passage led many states into illadvised tax cuts resulting in 
reduced services for citizens 
representatives of the aerospace and petroleum industries said 
the law has put their businesses at a disadvantage

a top administration official says south 
africa is likely to make enough progress in easing oppression 
against blacks over the next year to permit the lifting of us 
sanctions against that country 
the sanctions issue was revived last week after south african 
president frederick w de klerk lifted a 30year ban on the 
countrys main opposition group and said imprisoned antiapartheid 
militant nelson mandela would be freed soon 
president bush has said only that de klerks statement warrants 
a review of the sanctions policy but offered no predictions as to 
when they might be lifted 
congress has spelled out five conditions for removing the 
sanctions and has given the administration discretionary authority 
to lift them if south africa meets four of the conditions that 
step would be automatic if all five are satisfied 
the senior administration official speaking to reporters on 
wednesday noted members of congress have argued strenuously 
against any early end to the sanctions 
he said until the time is ripe we dont dare lift the 
sanctions 
the official insisting on anonymity said that by legalizing 
the african national congress and other antiapartheid groups the 
south african government already has satisfied one of the 
conditions set by congress 
he added he expected south african compliance on three of the 
remaining four conditions government agreement to engage in good 
faith negotiations on the countrys political future the lifting 
of the state of emergency and the release of political prisoners 
the fifth condition requires substantial progress toward the 
dismantling of south africas apartheid system 
the official acknowledged there may be some ambiguity as to 
south african compliance with the conditions he said there may be 
disagreement for example over who is a political prisoner 
the sanctions were approved in 1986 over president reagans 
veto reagan argued approval of sanctions would lead to a loss of 
the us ability to influence south africa to ease its 
segregationist policies 
the sanctions include a ban on new investment in south africa a 
prohibition on the import of certain south african products and the 
cancellation of landing rights for south african airlines 
the official noted the administration has invited both de klerk 
and mandela to visit the united states and he also raised the 
possibility that a senior us official may stop in south africa as 
part of tour of the general region 
he suggested such a visit could coincide with the ceremonies on 
march 21 formalizing namibian independence from south africa

child car seats should be used even if they 
have problems that call for recalls according to witnesses from 
the government juvenile products manufacturers and safety groups 
at a hearing prompted by a center for auto safety report 
alleging lax government policing of child restraint devices 
national highway traffic safety administrator jerry r curry vowed 
to examine government programs to test and recall faulty safety 
seats saying he is not pleased with the results 
but curry and other witnesses told a senate consumer 
subcommittee wednesday that misuse and nonuse of child safety seats 
in automobiles is a bigger threat to safety than any flaws that 
have been found in the seats 
government surveys show use of child safety restraints has 
increased from 15 percent to 81 percent in the last decade curry 
said but he added about 40 percent of youngsters are improperly 
restrained or not secured at all 
since 1981 the agency has tested 200 seat models with some 
resulting in test failures that have led to the recall of six 
million seats curry said 
he acknowledged only 54 percent of those actually have been 
brought into compliance but said many of the flaws are minor and 
even those that failed tests can provide some protection 
i am not pleased with the way its gone with the percentage 
of recalls curry told the senate commerce science and 
transportation consumer subcommittee 
on tuesday the agency warned owners of strolee gt3000 
convertible child seats manufactured in 1987 and 1988 they do not 
comply with federal standards when installed to face the rear of 
the car also some strolee model 609 and 610 seats developed 
cracks which could cut or pinch the child the government said 
although tests show they still offer sufficient restraint in 
accidents 
curry said the manufacturer is no longer in business so no 
recall program was possible 
sen richard bryan dnev the subcommittee chairman noted 
nhtsa waited until the eve of the hearing to release the warnings 
even though tests were conducted on the strolee seats several years 
ago curry said the matter went through the normal review process 
and he decided to release the information out of concern for safety 
even though it might appear he was trying to impress the committee 
use the child restraint you have because any child restraint 
is better than no child restraint advised auto safety advocate 
clarence ditlow whose report last month on faulty seats prompted 
the hearing 
the report by the center for auto safety was criticized by the 
government the juvenile products industry and some other safety 
groups because it might discourage parents from using the seats 
ditlows report said half the 27 million car seats that may be 
in use had been the subject of recalls or had failed government 
tests but were not investigated 
philip w haseltine of the american coalition for traffic safety 
said current recall rates are unacceptable but parents should 
continue to use noncomplying seats until they can be replaced or 
repaired

an old nickname came back to 
haunt this stretch of southern california sand on wednesday 
the community of 186000 was known as oil city 70 years ago 
when groves of oil derricks stood along the shore where surfers and 
sunbathers now gather by the hundreds of thousands 
the acrid smell of oil filled the air again wednesday after a 
rupture in one of the tanker american traders holds poured up to 
250000 gallons of alaskan crude into the sea just off the beach 
the accident brought local residents down to the citys pier 
late wednesday as word of the spill spread several gazed warily 
out to the yellow lights of the tanker moored in blackness 
offshore and expressed concerns about a replay of the destruction 
wrought in alaskas prince william sound when the tanker exxon 
valdez spilled more than 11 million gallons there last year 
i think its horrible i dont think the boat should be this 
close to shore i never thought anything like this would happen in 
huntington beach said 15yearold mike root im just afraid 
its going to happen like it happened in alaska 
several motorists pulled into a parking lot near the pier to ask 
beach officers what was happening some complained about the smell 
they said reached northward along the shore 
it was so bad it almost choked you huntington beach 
resident ken williams said 
you think of what happened in alaska said pete horne of 
newport beach to see that on the news and see the black waves 
covering the shore and here it happened so close to shore 
huntington beach has in recent years become one of southern 
californias most popular areas for surfers and sunbathers as the 
crowds arrived the oil derricks of old gave way to homes 
condominiums and redevelopment projects 
on the shore just north of the city is the bolsa chica wetlands 
wildlife area to the south lies huntington state beach and the 
city of newport beach which encompasses newport bay and the 
yachtstudded waters around lido isle and balboa island 
fifteen miles farther south lie the teeming tide pools of laguna 
beach and beyond that the scenic beaches and bays of dana point 
capistrano san clemente and san diego county 
coast guard officials said the crude could foul huntington city 
beach huntington state beach chica bolsa state beach and possibly 
the wetlands 
i think its a tragedy said city beach supervisor scott

unions are gaining female members to help 
offset organized labors large loss of male membership the 
government says 
the labor department said wednesday about 1695 million 
americans belonged to unions last year a decline of about 40000 
members from 1988 about 164 percent of the american workforce 
belonged to unions last year 
the number of men in unions dropped by about 200000 but female 
membership increased by about 160000 the number of hispanics and 
blacks belonging to unions stayed roughly the same 
the labor department said although the number of union members 
has been fairly constant since 1985 total employment has increased 
so the percentage of workers who are in unions has declined in 
1985 18 percent of the workforce belonged to unions 
fletcher hudson a labor management lawyer said employer 
attitudes towards workers has continually improved in recent years 
and so workers have not felt the need to join unions 
unions have had a lot of bad press the image is not as good 
as it was hudson said adding he did not expect an immediate 
turn of events for unions 
i think its going to take a backsliding of employer attitudes 
and maybe some inflationary type things to make unions seem to be 
the answer hudson said 
but susan cowell vice president of the international ladies 
garment workers union said labor activists were cheered by the 
steady membership level unions have maintained since they suffered 
major setbacks of the early 1980s 
the fact that its stabilized is a positive sign what we need 
to do now is start moving again she said 
labor analysts partially attributed gains in female membership 
to an increase in the number of women entering the workforce in 
addition the service sector of the economy traditionally an area 
employing large numbers of women has been expanding while the 
maledominated manufacturing sector has lost jobs 
markley roberts an economist with the 142 millionmember 
aflcio said women and minorities are a key to rejuvenating the 
american labor movement 
union officials said women see organized labor as a way to 
overcome pay discrepancies that still exist 
women are still getting the short end in many cases and they 
know that ms cowell said

the galileo space probe heading for jupiter 
on a sixyear roundabout journey will fly past the planet venus 
late friday and early saturday and gain momentum for the second leg 
of the trip back toward earth 
nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif said 
galileo will be 10028 miles above venus cloud tops when it makes 
its closest approach at 959 pm pacific time friday 
although the space probes instruments will be recording 
information about venus earths closest planetary neighbor the 
data wont be played back for scientists until october 
galileo was launched last october 18 from the cargo bay of the 
space shuttle atlantis after passing venus and gaining slingshot 
momentum from that flyby the 15 billion probe loops back and 
will come within 620 miles of earth in december 
with that added second push galileo once more will head out 
into deep space and return in 1992 coming as close as 200 miles of 
earth before it starts out for jupiter where it will arrive in 
december 1995 
there a robot will separate from the main spacecraft and plunge 
through the gaseous atmosphere of the solar systems largest 
planet galileo itself will orbit the planet for two years taking 
scientific measurements 
galileo carries a 49pound nuclear generator to provide 
electricity to power the crafts instruments similar generators 
have been used on other deep space probes including voyager which 
last year sent back photographs as it passed neptune at that point

the state department wants to fire felix s 
bloch the career diplomat who is suspected of spying for the 
soviet union 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said wednesday that as an 
interim step the department was ordering blochs immediate 
suspension and was stripping him of his salary estimated at 
80000 a year 
the diplomat who was placed on administrative leave with pay 
last june has 30 days to answer the charges and submit any 
information to show why he should be restored to duty 
his legal troubles began after he was reportedly videotaped 
passing a suitcase to a soviet agent in paris 
bloch could not be reached by telephone wednesday and his 
attorney declined comment on the state department action 
in the past bloch repeatedly has passed up chances to deny the 
allegations saying instead the government has not been able to 
bring charges much less prove them 
boucher refused to provide details of the action taken 
wednesday citing legal considerations 
bloch an urbane diplomat who has spent more than 30 years in 
the foreign service has not been formally prosecuted but there 
have been unofficial reports that the justice department believes 
its case against him is not strong enough to seek an indictment 
asked why the state department was taking action against bloch 
when the justice department has yet to press charges against him 
an official said the burden of proof for suspending an employee is 
less stringent than the requirements for a prosecution 
the disclosure that he was a suspect touched off a frenzied 
media pursuit of bloch during his long walks last summer to and 
from his washington apartment a roundtheclock fbi vigil of 
blochs apartment building was called off or sharply curtailed in 
december 
bloch was suspended on the basis of a government regulation 
authorizing the head of an agency to remove any employee without 
pay when the action is considered necessary in the interests of 
national security 
bloch had been the no 2 official of the us embassy in vienna 
for much of the reagan administration before taking up an 
assignment in washington 
electronic surveillance is said to have picked up bloch telling 
his wife that he had accepted payments from the soviets a former 
viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that bloch spent 
roughly 10000 a year for her services over seven years an 
amount investigators cannot find withdrawn from blochs 
acknowledged bank accounts 
meanwhile the state department declined comment on a report in 
common cause magazine that bloch has not undergone a security 
clearance since august 1973 despite a requirement that such reviews 
take place every five years 
two years ago the general accounting office a congressional 
watchdog agency issued a report alleging 8929 of the state 
departments longterm employees in sensitive positions were not 
reinvestigated within the fiveyear limit

sen dave durenberger faces ethics committee 
questions about his financial dealings amid new disclosures that he 
received 13 million in unsecured lowinterest loans from a bank 
where his cousin is a vice president 
the committee has been investigating charges that durenberger 
laundered speaking fees through a book contract used lobbyists to 
pay for personal trips and improperly charged the senate for his 
stays in his minneapolis condominium 
durenberger one of seven senators being investigated by the 
ethics committee was summoned to appear before the panel this 
afternoon 
the star tribune of minneapolis on wednesday published a list of 
23 loans that the commercial state bank of st paul minn made to 
the senator over the past decade at interest rates as much as 65 
points below prime lending rates a durenberger aide said wednesday 
the list was accurate 
the largest of the loans a twomonth loan in 1988 worth 
484332 was not listed on durenbergers annual financial 
disclosure form in apparent violation of senate rules 
durenbergers cousin jack is a vice president in the 
commercial lending section of the commercial state bank where he 
has worked since 1954 
but durenberger and bank officials denied he received any 
preferential treatment bank officials said the loans were 
justified by the senators financial stability and large savings 
accounts and that other borrowers have received similar terms 
i never asked for any special consideration from the bank and 
dont believe i was ever extended any durenberger said in a 
statement issued to the newspaper he declined to be interviewed 
wednesday 
an aide later said this is a mischaracterization of a banking 
relationship this is another example of taking a normal situation 
and blowing it out of proportion 
durenberger obtained 20 unsecured loans totaling 127 million 
from 1979 to 1988 including 12 at interest rates less than the 
prevailing prime lending rate according to the list 
banks usually charge one or two points more than the prime rate 
for consumer loans 
banks dont do a large amount of unsecured lending unless a 
person has a pretty substantial financial statement and the person 
is liquid said michael pint a minnesota bank owner and former 
state banking commissioner 
three other loans totaling 65646 were secured including two 
car loans and a 38400 mortgage 
the star tribune calculated the total value of the 23 loans at 
927078 because some of the unsecured loans were renewed and the 
unpaid balances were consolidated into new loans 
durenbergers 1988 financial disclosure report listed three 
loans from commercial state bank but missing from the form is the 
shortterm loan the senator got in june 1988 to obtain financing on 
a suburban washington townhouse 
the disclosure form contains instructions calling for 
information on any loan in excess of 10000 owed to any single 
creditor at any point during the year 
aides said they could not explain why the loan was not listed 
the star tribune also said durenberger failed to disclose two 
loans totaling 25000 in 1983 
durenbergers cousin had absolutely no involvement in any of 
the loan transactions for the senator carrie collins the 
senators press secretary told the associated press 
durenberger kept as much as 80000 in accounts at the bank 
said the banks president robert kastner the bank stopped lending 
to him at belowprime rates in 1983 after he moved his money into 
higherearning certificates of deposit 
we felt comfortable with the fact that the senator or a 
nonsenator would pay us back on the loans said the bank 
president richard kastner 
the bank has made similar loans to other customers including 
one who has a 2 million unsecured line of credit the banks 
lending limit he said

a judge called a junior government minister 
idiotic for grabbing a 6yearold girl who was picking flowers 
in his yard and taking her into his house for a scolding 
the girls father pleaded guilty wednesday to punching minister 
of state for employment timothy eggar but judge keith mchale told 
him i sympathize with you entirely in feeling irritation that 
your daughter had been interfered with in the way she was 
prosecutor jeremy cartermanning told the croydon crown court in 
south london that eggar grabbed the girl by the scruff of the neck 
and led her and her friend into his house for a lecture 
her father later went to eggars home butted the minister with 
his head and then punched him in the face breaking two teeth 
cartermanning said 
the judge said he believed a grown man seeing a child stealing 
flowers would know better than to take a small girl into his house 
it was a stupid idiotic and provocative thing to do and mr eggar 
should have known better 
the father who was not named in court because mchale ruled the 
girl should not be identified was given a suspended 21day prison 
sentence and ordered to pay 490 to repair eggars teeth and 
replace clothes ruined in the fight 
eggar 38 works for employment secretary michael howard a

wednesdays oil spill off huntington beach 
recalled the santa barbara spill 21 years ago that blackened the 
california coast and helped spawn the environmental movement 
the jan 28 1969 blowout of an improperly cased well on an 
offshore drilling platform operated by union oil co of california 
spewed more than 325 million gallons of oil over 800 square miles 
of water according to the california coastal commission 
the spill covered 100 miles of coastline and beaches with a 
thick tarry black goo smothering thousands of birds fish and 
other sea life the commission said 
the commission marking the disasters 20th anniversary last 
year said it helped trigger a new age of environmental 
awareness 
a spokesman for union now unocal corp has disputed those 
figures contending that only 30 miles of coastline were affected 
by a spill of no more than 840000 gallons 
the western states petroleum association however has said at 
least 21 million gallons spilled 
unocal which paid about 16 million in settlements in of 
spillrelated lawsuits also disputed claims that oil still leaks 
from the spill site it said the leakage is the result of natural 
oil seepage from the sea floor 
oil companies still drill for oil off santa barbara 
the petroleum association said last year that the environment 
has recovered from the santa barbara accident which spurred the 
oil industry to institute safer technology and tougher controls for 
oil drilling and production

a bipartisan group of lawmakers says congress 
will continue to support the afghan rebels and oppose any 
transitional government that includes sovietbacked leaders 
the eight lawmakers including sen robert byrd dwva and 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan sent the message to 
secretary of state james a baker iii as he was in moscow for a 
meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
the letter said there is strong support in congress for the 
longstanding us policy towards afghanistan 
sen gordon humphrey rnh said the message was designed to 
caution baker that congress would view with alarm and dismay 
any effort to allow the government of najibullah to remain in kabul 
baker intends to raise the issue of the 11year war in 
afghanistan in his meetings with shevardnaze 
soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan in 1988 but fighting 
has continued between the sovietsupport government of najibullah 
and the usbacked rebels who receive equipment through pakistan 
the members of congress said in a letter dated feb 6 they are 
committed to a continuation of lethal and nonlethal us 
assistance until it is clear that najibullah and his close 
associates have been removed from office 
they said they support a political process and outcome in 
afghanistan which represents true selfdetermination for the afghan 
people 
we believe america should not support a socalled 
transitional solution in afghanistan involving najibullah any 
more than we should have endorsed similar solutions in eastern 
europe they said 
they said the soviet leadership must understand fully that a 
continuation of their massive airlift to prop up their proxy regime 
in kabul will not succeed in wearing out american patience and 
cause us to agree to a political situation which abandons the brave 
people and sound principles that we have stood for in afghanistan 
for over a decade 
others signing the letter were house republican whip newt 
gingrich of georgia republican reps henry hyde of illinois don 
ritter of pennsylvania and bill mccollum of florida and rep 
charles wilson dtexas 
in an interview earlier in the week humphrey was critical of 
the cias handling of afghanistan much of the covert aid for the 
afghan rebels is channeled through the cia and the security agency 
in pakistan 
its pathetic he said of the situation in afghanistan 
specifically he said the cia was not playing a large enough role 
in planning the rebels strategy and planning the war against the 
najibullah forces

additional 500 million supplemental package for panama shortly 
bernard aronson the assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs was to testify before a senate committee 
today on the bush requests for aid to panama and el salvador 
the panama package included 10 million to help eastern european 
countries as they prepare for elections but bush would have to 
certify countries were committed to democratic multiparty 
elections before money was freed 
sen robert byrd dwva said the administration must notify 
congress within 48 hours of spending the money in eastern europe 
there was little opposition to the panama package with most 
members saying the united states has a duty to help the 
usinstalled government of president guillermo endara 
this is a reasonable but appropriate commitment on the part of 
the united states said rep william broomfield rmich citing 
the high unemployment and credit problem panama faces 
several house members however raised concerns about panamas 
bank secrecy laws which they say have allowed drug traffickers to 
launder money 
put panama on notice no more aid until they get rid of their 
bank secrecy laws which have allowed drug barons to launder 
profits said rep charles schumer dny 
the legislation requires panama to report by april 15 on efforts 
under way to stop banks from any involvement in drug trafficking 
others objected to the way the bush administration took money 
from aid to somalia and sudan for the panama package and said they 
want to see that african aid restored 
sen patrick leahy dvt called the move robbing the poor to 
help the poor 
the bill also includes trade and investment opportunities for 
panama administration officials estimate are worth 500 million 
the bill would 
give panama benefits under the caribbean basin initiative the 
generalized system of preferences the overseas private investment 
corp and the us sugar quota programs 
panama was cut off from trade and investment programs with the 
united states when former president reagan imposed sanctions o the 
country two years ago 
certifies panama is taking steps to cooperate to fight drugs 
provides 125 million in cash and another 10 million in 
guarantees to rebuild the panama citys chorillo neighborhood 
where fires in the wake of the invasion left 10000 people homeless

programs 55 million to help agencies of the new government of 
president guillermo endara prepare budgets and reorganize and

civil rights forces stung by setbacks in the 
supreme court plan action within days in the house and senate on 
legislation designed to protect women and minorities against bias 
on the job 
i give my full support to this landmark legislation which 
would restore a measure of hope to those who have suffered 
discrimination in the american workplace coretta scott king told 
a news conference wednesday 
she and the rev edmund l browning presiding bishop of the 
episcopal church joined lawmakers in calling for approval of the 
bill which has bipartisan sponsorship in both houses 
the measure marks the first counterattack by congressional 
liberals and civil rights forces following a series of supreme 
court rulings last year a newly solidified conservative court 
majority limited affirmative action and narrowed the scope of 
antibias laws 
hearings in the house and the senate are set to begin within 
days chief senate sponsor edward m kennedy dmass said 
approval at the committee level might be possible within three 
months 
the bush administration has said there is no urgent need for 
legislation to overturn the courts rulings promising to monitor 
the impact on job discrimination cases currently before the courts 
but the justice department said wednesday it would propose its 
own bills designed to counter two of the supreme court decisions 
attorney general dick thornburgh said one of the decisions was 
the socalled patterson case in which the court held that an 
oftenused civil rights statute dating from the civil war era 
does not bar racial harassment on the job 
thornburgh also pointed to the case of lorance versus atampt 
technologies inc in which the court ruled that in some cases 
discriminatory seniority programs must be challenged at the time 
they are adopted even if the victims were not employees at the 
time 
thornburgh said however the administration would oppose an 
effort to overturn three other supreme court decisions which he 
said were rooted in the courts opposition to racial quotas 
which we share 
kennedy told the news conference the supreme court rulings 
mark an abrupt and unfortunate departure from its historic 
vigilance in protecting civil rights the fabric of justice has 
been torn 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif the chief house sponsor said 
he hoped bush would sign the bill 
sen jim jeffords rvt urged republicans to back the bill 
saying the high court is closing the door on civil rights at a time 
when prison doors in south africa are swinging open i am ashamed 
and i am embarrassed 
the bill would 
bar harassment or firing of employees based on racial bias the 
court invalidated a lawsuit brought by a north carolina credit 
union worker brenda patterson who claimed she was the victim of 
racial harassment on the job the high court said ms patterson 
could not use an 1866 law to press her claim ruling the statute 
barred only hiring discrimination not harassment once a person was 
on the job 
force employers to show that any practice with proven 
discriminatory impact was prompted by business necessity the court 
ruled that the burden of proof belongs with workers who allege they 
are the victims of bias 
make clear that it is always illegal to use race ethnicity 
gender or religion as a motivating factor in employment decisions 
the supreme court ruling on that subject was vague enough to 
confuse lower courts 
make more permanent courtapproved affirmative action plans 
designed to remedy discrimination the court made it easier for 
white men to challenge such plans years after they are put into 
effect 
ease the deadlines for workers who sue over allegedly biased 
seniority systems the court ruled that the time for filing such 
lawsuits is determined by when a seniority plan is adopted not 
when an individual worker is affected 
assure victims of intentional discrimination the right to sue 
for monetary damages

congressional democrats are honing their 
attack on president bushs proposed pentagon budget but defense 
secretary dick cheney says the spending cuts they seek would do 
great damage to defense priorities 
cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff were among several administration officials who defended 
bushs 123 trillion budget for 1991 on capitol hill wednesday 
but some members of congress were not happy with what they heard 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt was 
joined by senate minority leader bob dole rkan also a panel 
member in demanding more details on the agriculture budget 
noting that bushs budget proposed 15 billion in cuts in 
commodity payments to farmers dole told agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter it would be helpful to have your specific 
recommendations where we are going to find the 15 billion 
yeutter told dole that he would be happy to negotiate the 
subsidies but in a less public setting 
budget director richard darman meanwhile told reporters that 
eventually there will be negotiations on the budget 
during a break in a hearing by the house appropriations 
committee darman predicted that the momentum for talks would not 
develop until congressional democrats had a chance to clarify their 
own budget plans 
the budget director described members of congress as frozen in 
place by sen daniel patrick moynihans proposal to cut social 
security payroll taxes by 62 billion and by expectations that 
there will be a large peace dividend as a result of a 
diminished communist military threat 
he predicted that savings in defense spending would not be much 
more than 4 billion 
meanwhile cheney and powell told the house budget committee 
that bushs 3033 billion defense budget 2 percent below the 
amount needed to keep pace with inflation reflected the lessened 
tensions with the soviet union but a continuing respect for a 
powerful rival 
the soviet union is the only nation in the world still capable 
of destroying us cheney said 
most democrats on the panel balked however arguing that 
military spending will have to be slashed further 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said he believed the 
pentagons budget would be cut 7 billion to 10 billion below what 
was needed to keep pace with inflation that would leave defense 
spending below 300 billion 
where were headed is obviously to a number higher than whats 
been recommended here panetta said referring to the size of the 
defense cuts 
cheney responded that the cuts suggested by panetta would do 
great damage to those priorities we have 
appearing before the senate armed services committee the top 
us military officer in europe said he would prefer to see a 
higher limit on the number of us troops in central europe than 
the 195000 that bush has proposed 
calling that figure an absolute bottom line gen john r 
galvin said he had urged bush to seek a higher figure because we 
have to look at the full array of reasons why we have the force 
deployed 
elsewhere louis sullivan secretary of the department of health 
and human services chided a senate appropriations subcommittee for 
approving less money last year than the president had requested for 
such programs as head start aids research and prevention and the 
homeless 
in testimony submitted to the subcommittee sullivan said 
this year you will hear from me loud and clear i will fight for 
every dollar in our budget i hope this year we can get more action 
and fewer words

president bush criticized by 
environmentalists for his response on global warming faces new 
attacks on two other environmental issues protecting wetlands and 
cleaning up pollution on federal lands 
the national governors association released a report wednesday 
accusing the bush administration of hamstringing the environmental 
protection agency in attempts to pursue federal agencies that are 
violating pollution laws 
the nations chief environmental watchdog is forced to sit by 
as basic environmental statutes and regulations are routinely 
ignored at federally owned facilities said the report 
it said state authorities often are thwarted from action against 
federal sites by claims of national security 
the report by an nga task force cited a justice department 
policy which bars civil suits or enforcement actions against 
another federal agency on behalf of the epa 
idaho gov cecil andrus cochairman of the task force said 
bush could resolve the problem by one phone call to the epa and 
the justice department if you make a mess you clean it up were 
saying that goes for the federal government as well as private 
citizens the democratic governor said 
andrus said bush recognizes that there is widespread pollution 
on federal lands ranging from military bases to western grazing 
land held by the interior department but is proposing too little 
money to clean it up 
the epa lists 1268 federal facilities for priority cleanup 
efforts and that number is expected to grow for many years 
federal facilities have been among the worst violators of 
federal pollution laws said the governors report 
meanwhile environmentalists charged bush was retreating from a 
pledge to protect the nations wetlands they accused the 
administration of softening a policy position aimed at assuring 
that developers who exploit wetlands compensate for any 
environmental loss 
the criticism was prompted by a final agreement between the epa 
and the us army corps of engineers that outlines the procedures a 
developer must take and what compensation must be provided to 
develop a wetland area 
environmentalists hailed the position when it was tentatively 
agreed to last november but the document was revised during 
negotiations within the administration in recent weeks and 
environmentalists said the final version would allow developers in 
some cases to exploit wetlands without compensating for the 
environmental loss 
kathryn fuller president of the world wildlife fund and the 
conservation foundation said the revised agreement casts doubt on 
bushs promise to protect wetlands in the country 
the bush administration backed off from a strong position 
and has created one that is riddled with loopholes said robert 
irvin of the national wildlife federation 
the interagency agreement was negotiated for weeks by a number 
of federal agencies including the epa transportation department 
energy department and corps of engineers and white house chief of 
staff john sununu 
the white house was lobbied vigorously by oil companies and 
members of the alaska congressional delegation who argued that the 
original wetlands agreement might preclude drilling in vast areas 
of the states north slope tundra 
epa administrator william reilly reportedly argued for generally 
keeping the original document the epa announced a final decision 
without comment white house spokesmen have denied the revised 
document represents a change in the presidents commitment to 
protecting wetlands 
the energy department characterized the changes as providing 
needed flexibility to assure the development of petroleum and gas 
resources while protecting against further net loss of wetlands

the decision of communist leaders to give up their 
monopoly on power has met only one demand of citizens who are 
hostages to an economy that is slipping from chaos to catastrophe 
the move wednesday by the partys policymaking central 
committee attacks the most visible targets middlelevel party 
officials who have long been under pressure from mikhail s 
gorbachev and now feel heat from below 
but it will take some time to change the stalinist structure and 
centrally orchestrated decisionmaking mechanism that put those 
officials in power and allowed the economy to sink slowly into 
disarray 
the changes will depend on gorbachevs success in attracting new 
people who are honest innovative and able to gain the peoples 
confidence 
gorbachev is gambling he can find the right people in the 
communist party and keep them there 
his risk is that the apparatus now apparently on its way out has 
so damaged the partys credibility that the people he needs will 
turn to alternative movements and parties given the green light by 
the central committee decision 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev gorbachevs most 
powerful adviser in the partys ruling body told a news conference 
wednesday the central committee meeting represented a crucial and 
historic moment for the soviet union 
the shaky economy gorbachev inherited when he came to power in 
1985 characterized by a huge budget deficit inflation a 
worthless currency and shortages of consumer goods plunged into 
serious crisis last year 
president gorbachev addressing the central committee on monday 
said the crisis had not reached bottom and the key economic 
questions now involved personnel 
in relieving food shortages he said the crux of the matter 
now is the position of our cadre at the center and localities 
and he indicated changes at the top also were coming 
it is necessary to realign forces in the upper echelons of 
power in order to give more dynamism to perestroika processes and 
ensure more firmly their irreversibility he said 
next week the supreme soviet parliament will consider laws on 
ownership of land and other property taxation and other issues 
although the laws have been discussed for months they remain 
vaguely worded and could be liberally interpreted by local 
officials if the leadership wants it that way 
in the weeks before the central committee meeting people in a 
few large cities took their frustrations out on local leaders 
popular protests caused party officials accused of abusing their 
power to quit in four large cities of the volga region the ural 
mountains and the ukraine the officials were accused of using 
their authority to obtain goods and services unavailable to the 
masses who must spend hours in lines trying to obtain consumer 
goods westerners take for granted 
vitaly korotich a popular reformist editor told thousands of 
people who gathered near the kremlin on sunday that they should not 
have to live so poorly in the future

fall by freeing 19 jailed opposition activists and promising to 
release all other political prisoners 
but opponents said the action wednesday did not mean democracy 
was on the way 
i consider i have left a small jail for a bigger one evans 
paul one of the released activists said in an interview broadcast 
by radio antilles the whole country is a prison 
the amnesty measure comes less than three weeks after the 
government of lt gen prosper avril declared a state of siege 
arrested many activists and sent several opposition leaders into 
exile 
several of those released wednesday were beaten while in prison 
including three who suffered serious head and body injuries fellow 
activists said four were jailed last year and most of the others 
were believed to have been arrested in a state of siege last month 
in a televised speech wednesday night avril announced a 
general amnesty of all those implicated in crimes against 
national security he urged haitians to respect the rules of 
the democratic game which he also promised to do 
the amnesty came exactly four years after baby doc 
duvaliers 1986 flight to exile in france following a popular 
uprising ending a 29year family dynasty in the impoverished 
carribean nation 
the government declared the day a paid national holiday 
a decree read on government tv after the speech said the amnesty

sue 
mesyeux paul and etienne were arrested nov 1 and accused of 
possessing arms and explosives and of plotting to kill avril

beauchard a former sergeant who helped bring avril to power 
was arrested dec 13 and accused of conspiring with mesyeux paul 
and etienne he was expelled from the army in late 1988 after avril 
accused him of plotting a countercoup 
press releases from the mens organizations said three suffered 
serious injuries they said paul may remain paralyzed on one 
side of his body that etienne may lose his right eye and has a 
broken ear drum and that mesyeux suffers from back pain and has 
problems walking due to pain on the bottom of his feet 
the three went on a 27day hunger strike during their 
imprisonment 
avril promised when he was brought to power in a soldiers 
revolt that unlike namphys regime his government would respect 
human rights but rights groups have denounced it for abuses

a tankers hull was gashed and 
hundreds of thousands of gallons of heavy alaskan crude oil spewed 
from the ship wednesday two miles off a popular southern california 
beach officials said 
early reports indicated that more than 290000 gallons of north 
slope crude spilled from the fully loaded 811foot american trader 
according to coast guard rear adm william kime 
hours after the 435 pm accident the leading edge of the 
1mile long oil slick was headed toward several recreational 
beaches and a wildlife estuary surrounding the huntington beach 
harbor coast guard officials said 
those wetlands and wildlife preserves are so very precious 
said dorothy green president of heal the bay a local 
environmental group 
the coast guard initially reported the tanker had struck a 
submerged pipeline but huntington beach spokesman dave kelly said 
the ship was punctured by its own anchor 
as the ship was docking the anchor swung back into the bow 
breaching the forward compartment kelly said 
coast guard cmdr scott porter assistant chief of marine 
safety couldnt confirm kellys report 
a diver found a 3foot hole in the bottom of the tankers no 1 
forward compartment which holds more than 1 million gallons of 
crude coast guard capt james card told reporters late wednesday 
no other damage was found 
the tankers captain who was not identified would be tested 
for alcohol and drug use as a routine part of the investigation 
card said 
coast guard officials expected the oil would foul huntington 
city beach huntington state beach and chica bolsa state beach an 
environmentally sensitive marsh behind chica bolsa clearly is 
threatened porter said 
at this time of the year what we know is that the currents 
would carry it in toward the beach toward the northwest porter 
said 
the spilled crude was the same kind as the oil that fouled 
alaskas prince william sound last year when more than 10 million 
gallons spilled from the exxon valdez in the nations worst oil 
spill porter said 
about all we saw was the discolored surface of the water a 
mile and a half offshore said huntington beach city lifeguard 
greg crow then it got dark and we couldnt see anything more 
porter characterized the incident as a major spill and said 
the coast guards pacific area strike team had been activated and 
was en route from its base in san francisco 
cleanup crews from the coast guard the orange county harbor 
patrol and county fire department and a private contractor went to 
the scene officials said 
oil containment booms were set around the tanker and there was 
minimal leakage from the tanker about three hours after the 
accident officials said 
an emergency response team of local state and federal officials 
was being convened by telephone to discuss the emergency said 
kime commander of the 11th coast guard district 
the american trader was leased by british petroleum oil shipping 
co usa said joe braderich manager of the firms los angeles 
field office it is operated by american trading transportation co 
inc of new york city 
the tanker was on a final approach maneuver in about 80 feet of 
water to hook up with a mooring buoy when it struck something 
braderich said after the tanker is secured to the buoy the crew 
usually connects to a pipeline hauled up from the ocean bottom to 
pump its cargo ashore he added 
the ships draft when fully loaded is about 40 feet said 
american trading president sanford schmidt 
the tanker was carrying about 500000 barrels or 21 million 
gallons in its 10 hull tanks said schmidt the compartment that 
was breached carries about 25000 barrels or about 1050000 
gallons 
any spill over 100000 gallons is considered major kime said 
british petroleum has assumed responsibility for the spill the 
admiral said 
the spill occurred just off huntington beach a city about 30 
miles south of los angeles long popular with southern california 
surfers and sunbathers and often the scene for movies and 
television shows featuring surfing 
a city police helicopter crew estimated the slick from the spill 
was about 300 feet wide and 1 miles long said city lifeguard 
capt william richardson it stretched from the ship to an area 
north of the pier a distance of about 12 blocks 
the mooring buoy serves as an offloading point for an oil 
terminal 30 miles north of huntington beach when the spill 
occurred richardson said 
navigation charts show several submerged pipelines in the area 
including a pipeline used by tankers to unload fuel oil for a 
southern california edison power plant at huntington beach beals 
said 
southern california edison spokesman keith sheldon said the 
utilitys pipeline was unaffected by the incident

question if you call a person who speaks two 
languages bilingual what do you call a person who speaks one 
language 
an american says rep george sangmeister dill 
he is introducing legislation today that authorizes 58 million 
in federal funds over five years and matching grants to states for 
instruction in foreign studies language and geography 
we live in an increasingly global society we can no longer 
afford a generation of children uneducated and uninterested in the 
world outside the united states said sangmeister we must 
spark that interest and ability early so that our students become 
proficient in foreign language by high school or college 
sangmeisters sentiments have become a familiar chorus among 
educators politicians businessmen and even president bush all 
are concerned with the flood of reports that focus on what american 
students dont know 
experts estimate 30 million americans are functionally 
illiterate and as many as 2 million students leave school with 
deficient basic skills each year 
to address the problems bush in his state of the union address 
listed key education goals that include making american students 
first in the world by the year 2000 in science and math and 
ensuring that children leave grades four eight and 12 having 
mastered english mathematics science history and geography 
still the nations report card continues to release negative 
reports 
in its first study of geography education the national 
assessment of educational progress popularly known as the 
nations report card said wednesday most students demonstrated a 
limited understanding of the characteristics of the planet earth 
and the relationships between people and their environment 
the study found the 12th graders tested responded correctly on 
average to only 57 percent of the geography test questions 
overall however there were wide differences depending on how 
difficult the question was for example 87 percent of the 3000 
seniors tested could locate canada on a world map and 85 percent 
could locate the soviet union but only 33 percent could identify 
the order of the oceans moving west to east from africa 
the results are disturbing because students need an 
understanding of other countries and cultures to master other 
subjects said gilbert grosvenor president of the national 
geographic society 
students cannot understand discussions of a tale of two 
cities in english class if they dont know the relationship 
between london and paris or the significance of the english 
channel grosvenor said while learning percentages in mathematics 
or lessons of census shifts in civics students could predict the 
growth rate of religious sects or the impact of immigration he 
said 
delaware gov michael castle said regional and national 
geographical knowhow plays a role in many jobs 
consider a taxi driver who cannot read a map or a fire truck 
driver who doesnt know the fastest way across town he said 
sangmeister sad a lack of knowledge of foreign languages has a 
similar effect on world trade and other jobs he noted 80 percent 
of all goods face foreign competition abroad and four out of five 
new jobs are created as a result of foreign trade 
however only 18 percent of the states require geography to 
graduate and only 17 percent of public elementary schools offer any 
form of language instruction japanese high schools require six 
years of foreign languages compared with one to two years in the 
united states 
the international association for the evaluation of educational 
achievement reports that in a 1988 study of science achievement in 
17 countries americas 10yearolds ranked eighth and 14yearolds 
ranked 14th just 40 percent of american 13yearolds could solve a 
twostep math problem compared with 72 percent of the south korean 
students 
the writing and reading naep reports found merely subtle 
changes in reading performance at the national level since the 
first assessment in 1971 but no improvement in an already low 
writing performance

erich honecker kept a private stash of 60 
million into which the former east german communist leader dipped 
to make special purchases such as a watch once owned by vladimir 
i lenin prosecutors said 
the countrys deputy chief prosecutor lothar reuter on 
wednesday read an astonishing list of the extravagances and corrupt 
activities allegedly committed by communist party officials during 
honeckers 18year rule 
he said that during 40 years of communist rule corruption was 
rampant but that prosecutors still have not uncovered all the 
details 
honeckers private account on any given day contained about 60 
million reuter said most of it supplied by a former official 
accused of arranging illegal arms exports 
honecker once used 454000 from such an account to buy a the 
lenin pocket watch reuter alleged 
the former leader ousted oct 18 in a peaceful popular revolt 
also apparently had his generous side 
sometimes just before christmas he would bless the people 
by arranging purchases of bananas nearly nonexistent in east 
germany reuter charged that at such moments honecker was trying 
to play santa claus of the nation being bilked by communist 
officials 
he said leading officers of the state security service were 
stealing western currency sent through the mail to east german 
citizens from west german friends and relatives in the last three 
years alone more than 4 million was pilfered in this fashion he 
alleged 
honecker 77 and a number of his lieutenants are awaiting trial 
on a broad range of charges from high treason to human rights 
violations to misuse of public funds 
the former leader was arrested last week and sent to prison but 
he was released a day later after doctors determined he was too 
frail to withstand detention 
authorities announced wednesday that honecker will be indicted 
for high treason in march and tried before the countrys supreme 
court he could face life in prison if convicted 
many of honeckers former lieutenants are in jail and also will 
stand trial such as expremier willi stoph ousted economics chief 
guenther mittag and fired security chief erich mielke 
reuter said honecker and other communists who have been 
interrogated for criminal acts seem to show little remorse 
most of the accused have either a slight sense of guilt or 
none at all reuter told reporters by and large they are not 
ready to assume responsibility for the immense squandering of 
public wealth 
reuter said honeckers private accounts were kept filled with 
western currency by alexander schalckgolodkowski east germanys 
former chief foreign trader who has fled the country 
schalckgolodkowski has been accused of overseeing an illegal 
weapons depot to export arms and earn western currency for east 
germanys leaders 
police found 24760 machine pistols 1398 automatic rifles 
1691 revolvers six bazookas 502 hand grenades and a vast number 
of bullets when they raided the depot in december the official adn 
news agency said wednesday 
mielke once had a mansion built for 606000 but never used it 
said reuter nonetheless mielke kept the house supplied with power 
and it was looked after daily according to reuter 
a total of 134000 was paid annually to heat stophs private 
greenhouses said reuter 
he also told of top communist party officials who would help 
themselves to videocassette recorders and other expensive 
electronic goods seized by customs authorities 
reuter said prosecutors across east germany have been 
overwhelmed with work on the corruption cases he did not reveal 
how many arrests have been made or say how many trials might be 
held 
there are hundreds of cases like this across the country he 
said

the commander of the us pacific command told 
congress wednesday that the united states should stop paying 
compensation to the philippines for two american bases 
adm huntington hardisty said he remains cautiously 
optimistic that the us and filipino governments can work out an 
agreement on clark air base and subic bay naval station before 
their leases expire next year 
philippines president corazon aquino who put down a coup 
attempt against her government in december is facing renewed 
pressure from top government officials not to extend the rights on 
the bases 
hardisty said the united states has contingency plans to move 
american forces in case usphilippines negotiations fail but the 
bases are ideal for the us effort in the pacific 
there is no single location or combination of locations that 
can replace what we now have in the philippines in terms of cost 
strategic positioning and operational efficiency hardisty told 
the house armed services committee 
the bush administration is requesting 200 million in fiscal 
1990 in payment to the philippines but congress is not expected to 
approve more than 160 million and hardisty said that was too much 
i feel were maxed out on compensation he told the 
committee in my opinion neither the congress nor the 
administration should vote for compensation weve got to be 
innovative and look at other ways other than paying rent

a study today warns doctors against giving 
phenobarbital to babies who suffer convulsions during high fevers 
because the medicine taken by tens of thousands of children 
doesnt prevent seizures and may lower iqs 
there might be an unusual child for whom this treatment 
would still be of benefit said dr deborah g hirtz it should 
not be used in most cases 
phenobarbital is the drug of choice given to infants with 
socalled febrile seizures 
an estimated 130000 american babies a year suffer at least one 
such seizure and up to 40000 are given the drug to prevent the 
convulsions from recurring said dr jonas h ellenberg a 
statisician at the national institute of neurological disordered 
and stroke and coauthor of the study with hirtz 
hirtz said there has been growing concern about the possible 
hazards of phenobarbital an anticonvulsant long used for treating 
epilepsy 
in this trial we wanted to ask the question of whether there 
were specific cognitive and behavioral side effects in young 
children treated for febrile seizures she said the major 
outcome variable was the iq test at the end of treatment we did 
find that there was a difference between children who had been 
given phenobarbital and those given placebo 
after two years of treatment the iqs of those taking 
phenobarbital were 8 points lower than those who had taken dummy 
pills six months after they went off the drug their iqs were 
still 5 points lower 
hirtz said further study is in progress to see if the 
youngsters iqs eventually catch up she said that while a 
difference of a few points shows up on tests its too small to be 
noticed in an individual child 
the study was directed by dr jacqueline r farwell of the 
university of washington it was published in the new england 
journal of medicine 
the study was conducted on 217 children who ranged from age 8 
months to 3 years and had experienced at least one febrile seizure 
they were randomly assigned to take phenobarbital or placebos 
fortysix percent taking placebos and 38 percent getting 
phenobarbital had at least one more seizure during the two years of 
treatment this difference was not statistically meaningful 
the study did not address the use of the drug to treat epilepsy 
but dr w edwin dodson a member of the board of the epilepsy 
foundation of america urged parents not to suddenly discontinue 
their childrens use of phenobarbital because a sudden withdrawal 
could trigger seizures that are harder to control

the house is trying to ensure that legislation 
on oil spill liability require double hulls and double bottoms on 
tankers calling on us ports 
the house on wednesday approved 37637 a nonbinding 
resolution instructing negotiators to keep the provision in the 
bill that comes out of talks between the house and senate 
the provision is part of the bill passed the house but not in 
the senate version 
the housesenate conference committee is expected to begin work 
immediately on a compromise bill that both houses can approve 
before the march 24 anniversary of the exxonvaldez tanker spill in 
prince william sound alaska 
the vote on the resolution came before wednesdays major oil 
spill off a southern california beach 
a tanker off huntington beach calif struck an object under 
water spewing thousands of gallons of alaska crude oil from the 
american trader initial reports were that as much as 250000 
gallons of crude oil spilled making it the nations worst oil 
spill since the valdez 
the hull issue is viewed as the stickiest problem among the 
differences between the two bills the legislation which has taken 
14 years to get this far in congress is a comprehensive package of 
regulations laying out how oil spill cleanups should be managed 
and financed 
the hullbottom provision of the house bill requires tankers 
carrying oil and hazardous materials to be retrofitted with double 
bottoms within seven years of enactment and double hulls within 15 
years new tankers would have to be built with double hulls and 
double bottoms 
the senate version calls for a study to determine if any other 
technology would be an even better protection to the environment in 
case of a tanker accident

labor secretary elizabeth dole says she will 
toughen enforcement of child labor laws and seek higher fines for 
offenders 
the secretary said in a statement wednesday the department would 
review possible fines and would seek to take penalties to the 
highest level permissible under the law 
labor shortages in some areas in the future may put pressure on 
employers to hire young people and she said we want to make sure 
that employers follow the law to provide safe and rewarding work 
experiences 
mrs dole said she directed bill brooks assistant secretary for 
employment standards to develop a plan for targeted enforcement 
against egregious offenders and to recommend other changes 
in a speech to the departments child labor advisory committee 
brooks said child labor violations uncovered by the department 
of labor have more tha doubled since 1982 although tougher 
enforcement may explain some of the increase 
but labor shortages in certain areas have made it harder for 
businesses to find enough workers and some have responded by 
violating child labor laws he said in the remarks made available 
by the department 
brooks said the department would among other things 
step up efforts to increase public awareness of the law 
seek more injunctions against illegal acts 
propose better regulations for jobs which pose particular 
hazards for 16yearolds and 17yearolds 
generally those under 14 may work only in specific jobs exempt 
from the law the law and department regulations govern hours 
during which people under 16 may work and restrict employment in 
hazardous occupations for those under 18 different standards apply 
for farm labor

former federal judge walter l nixon jr 
arguing the senate impeachment procedures under which he was 
removed from the bench were unconstitutional wants a federal court 
to restore his judicial pay and benefits 
nixons lawyers this week said mediation was unlikely to resolve 
his lawsuit which challenges the senate vote nov 3 to remove him 
from office 
a federal jury convicted nixon in 1986 of lying to a federal 
grand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with a 
district attorney the senate vote stripped him of his title of 
us district judge and 89500 salary 
the lawsuit asserts nixons conviction is unconstitutional 
because it was based on a trial before a committee of 12 senators 
rather than the full senate the senate impeachment rule and a 
resolution setting up the committee are unconstitutional the 
lawsuit says 
the senate voted 899 to convict nixon of lying to the grand 
jury when he denied discussing the marijuana case with the 
prosecutor senators also voted 7819 to convict him of lying to a 
federal grand jury when he said he had nothing to do with the 
marijuana case and had never tried to influence its outcome 
nixons lawsuit against the us government is assigned to us 
district court judge louis oberdorfer with both sides to submit a 
pretrial schedule to oberdorfer by march 8 the lawsuit was filed 
nov 20 
on jan 22 oberdorfer said lawyers for the government and nixon 
should discuss referring the dispute for mediation on some or all 
of the issues in the case 
but david stewart one of nixons lawyers said tuesday that 
this is a constitutional issue not a commercial dispute 
indicating that stewart doesnt regard mediation as appropriate in 
the case 
nixon served 20 months of a fiveyear prison term for perjury 
and was released from a halfway house 18 days after the senate 
removed him from office 
nixon 61 of ocean springs miss is fighting a legal battle 
to resume practicing law his law license has been suspended

president bush stands fully behind proposed 
legislation to guarantee the rights of disabled americans an 
administration spokesman told conservative lawmakers who claim the 
bill could wreck the economy 
it is not a bill that has been lightly considered equal 
employment opportunity commissioner evan j kemp jr told the 
republican study committee task force on competitiveness 
it does have the backing of the executive branch and both 
houses of congress kemp testified wednesday before the group of 
republican house members reviewing the americans with disabilities 
act 
rep tom delay rtexas and chairman of the task force said he 
and his colleagues were concerned that the act may be moving too 
quickly through congress to explore the impact it will have on our 
businesses on our judicial system and on our nations productivity 
as a whole 
kemp said more than 8 million disabled americans could be 
brought into the work force through the employmentprotection 
provisions of the law saving the government 300 billion in 
welfare and other payments 
those workers would also make the country more productive and 
competitive by easing projected labor shortages he said 
the bill is also intended to ensure that the nations 43 million 
disabled people have full access to shops restaurants lodging and 
other public accommodations 
the ada passed the senate in september on a 768 vote 
the bill has since cleared one of the four house committees with 
jurisdiction and is expected to be passed by the full chamber this

the names of 26 million parents who owe child 
support have been given to the internal revenue service so any 
federal income tax refunds they are due can be used to pay their 
obligations officials said 
last year nearly 452 million was collected by garnishing 
federal income tax refunds under the program 
parents subject to garnishing are those who owe 500 or more in 
child support or who owe at least 150 in child support and have 
children receiving aid to families with dependent children 
assistance 
the program is considered a costeffective way to make sure 
children are getting the support they are due said eunice thomas 
acting director of the office of child support enforcement in the 
department of health and human services 
under the program it costs an average of 454 per case to 
collect an average of 654 for nonafdc cases and an average of 
562 for afdc cases she said 
the program enacted by congress was begun in 1981 for afdc 
families and expanded in 1984 to other families

a czechoslovak diplomat said today that the 
kremlin is balking at a swift pullout of the estimated 75000 
soviet troops in czechoslovakia citing difficulties in absorbing 
the returning soldiers 
soviet and czechoslovak officials resumed negotiations today in 
moscow on the pullout which the new prague government wants 
completed by the end of the year 
antonin murgas a spokesman for the czechoslovak embassy in 
moscow said the soviets have argued that the deadline is 
impossible to meet for humanitarian reasons 
he said the soviet side contends such a pullout cannot begin 
until 1991 because there are not currently enough schools and homes 
in the soviet union for the families of the officers stationed in 
czechoslovakia 
czechoslovakias new noncommunist government led by president 
vaclav havel declared void two 1968 agreements with moscow that 
legalized the troops deployment 
the government which replaced hardline communists after a 
peaceful revolution in november not only demands all the troops 
out by the end of the year but wants half of the force out by may 
unlike hungary where initial talks on a soviet troop withdrawal 
took place last week czechoslovakia considers the matter of soviet 
troop withdrawal separate from vienna talks on arms reduction in 
europe 
the soviet forces in both countries are viewed as occupiers who 
crushed movements for democracy in hungary in 1956 and in 
czechoslovakia in 1968 
the demands from prague and budapest for a soviet troop pullout 
have increased pressure on moscow for a radical cutback in central 
europe under discussion at the vienna talks 
us secretary of state james a baker iii was in moscow today 
for talks on the us proposal to cut soviet and american troops in 
all of europe to 225000 on each side with a limit of 195000 in 
central europe

packing 80 mph winds britains second major storm 
in two weeks felled trees disrupted transportation and brought 
rains that flooded homes and farmland police said the storm 
claimed two lives 
the atlantic storm hit wednesday lashing coastal towns and 
cities with southwesterly winds and disrupting ferry sailings in 
the english channel 
the winds and rain continued early today 
flooding shut down 25 miles of the a48 freeway in western 
england today gloucestershire police said 
british rail said rail links between perth and dundee in 
scotland and two routes in wales were closed today because of 
flooding fallen trees or damaged overhead power pickup lines on 
electrified sections of track 
police said a man died wednesday when a tree blown over by the 
wind crushed his car near andover 60 miles southwest of london 
a repairman trying to restore power to homes without electricity 
because of storm damage near warminster 95 miles west of london 
was also killed wednesday when he was struck by a car 
police said at least three people were injured in the storm 
the strong winds brought down power lines in southern england 
blacking out the small town of fleet 35 miles southwest of london 
and 2000 homes in surrounding countryside 
wales and the west country are particularly badly hit with 
flooding and very high winds making conditions absolutely 
unbearable a spokesman for the automobile association said 
weather forecasting organizations have been scrupulous about 
predicting storms since an october 1987 nighttime storm that took 
much of southern england by surprise killing 20 people a defense 
ministry investigation said the meteorological office failed to 
give adequate warning of that storm because its scientists put too 
much trust in the predictions of an outofdate computer 
a storm that struck europe on jan 25 killed 47 people in 
britain and caused 17 billion in damage 
forecasters said the high winds are caused by cold air moving 
down from the arctic hitting unseasonably warm air surrounding 
britain in the atlantic creating the very dramatic low pressure 
that fuels the winds

foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua at a weekly briefing 
also dismissed as utterly groundless charges of widespread 
human rights violations by the usbased human rights organization 
asia watch 
the annual state department human rights report has yet to be 
released but congressional sources in washington say it harshly 
criticizes china 
it reportedly chronicles the continued political use of 
executions suppression of labor rights slave labor camps in 
western china and religious persecution of catholics and buddhists 
jin said he had not seen the report but we are resolutely 
opposed to the imposition of ones own values on others by any 
country and interference in chinas internal affairs under the 
pretext of human rights 
he added should the us state department insist on its 
wanton attacks against china in its human rights report which is 
based on rumors and which is to be released soon it will certainly 
do further serious harm to sinous relations and will arouse 
greater indignation from the chinese people 
he said the asia watch report released wednesday which accuses 
china of continued arrests and secret executions of people involved 
in the crushed prodemocracy movement was utterly groundless and 
with ulterior motives 
the chinese government attaches importance to human rights 
he said and the fact that some individuals are dealt with 
according to law because they have breached the criminal law is 
just for the purpose of protecting the human rights of the broad 
masses 
he said the chinese government has stated that participants of 
the prodemocracy demonstations last spring who did not violate 
criminal law would not be prosecuted 
the asia watch report said tens of thousands of dissenters are 
languishing in chinese jails many are denied access to lawyers and 
are subject to physical and mental torture it said 
the report criticized president bush for moving to improve 
relations with china while human rights violations remain pervasive

actress kim basinger who bought a third 
of this north georgia town for 20 million last month has said she 
wants to preserve its oldtime character and wont tear down even a 
barn 
but then nobody tears down much here 
old barns still contain forgotten buckboards and horsedrawn 
plows from the days before the boll weevil ate up the cotton 
the blacksmith shop where the village smithy hasnt sung for 
decades still stands and the forges and carriagemaking equipment 
are still there 
at the braselton store cedelia hosch gives a hearty turn on the 
cash register crank and as the numbers of the sale pop up the 
cash drawer yawns open leisurely a little sign flips from 
barter to credit to cash 
a fading federal poster on the wall notes that the minimum wage 
is 190 an hour 
the store used to be the town bank and the small round safe 
hasnt been moved out 
its not for show its the way braselton is 
basinger who starred in batman and grew up in nearby 
athens hasnt said specifically what she and her coinvestors want 
to do with the land bought from the braselton clan 
the 1728acre purchase of which about 1000 acres is in town 
includes a 600acre industrial park with utilities a few 
residences some land ripe for development and most of downtown 
which consists mainly of a complex of braselton family stores 
founded in 1887 
in the connecting warren of a hardware and building supply shop 
a furniture store a grocery and a department store a drug store 
and what used to be the bank you can buy it all from beans to 
bullets to a brass bed 
they used to say they had everything here from the cradle to 
the grave said mrs hosch a lifelong resident of the area and 
24year braselton employee and they did they sold cradles and 
they sold caskets 
the mayor is a braselton as was the one before him and all but 
one councilman has braselton family ties the sale does not affect 
the town government or services such as water and sewer systems 
the council will keep its control on zoning matters 
unlike much of smalltown america braselton is not dying out 
it contains a mitsubishi plant a winery and a tool factory people 
are moving into the region not out 
the population has stayed steady at about 500 but more than 
5000 people live within five miles braselton has freeway access 
is about 45 minutes north of atlanta and land prices are on the 
rise residential developments are springing up and crime is low 
there is only one cop and one stoplight parking is no problem 
herbert kit braselton who runs the hardware store said the 
24 stockholders in the family holdings decided nine years ago to 
sell 
from his rolltop desk he pointed to boxes of offers they had 
received over they years most he said wanted to pay for it over 
20 or 30 years 
but the heirs are getting up in age most of them are past 
75 he said describing himself as a young buck who turns 70 
this month we were hunting a cash deal 
he said the heirs also had the community in mind miss basinger 
promised to do well by the town and i think she will 
mayor henry edward braselton who operates the grocery store 
said he hoped the towns history would be preserved 
during the depression when cash was scarce the braselton 
family printed its own to pay field hands and store workers it was 
good only at the family stores and samples of it are in a frame on 
the wall near the old cash register 
a bittersweet collection of yellowing pictures and newspaper 
clippings on the wall traces the towns progress 
there is a 1956 letter and two 1 bills from a man who said i 
want this letter and these two onedawler bills to go to the head 
manager to atone for a 10cent toy he shoplifted there on 
christmas eve 1917 
miss basinger has mentioned a possible recording and film 
studio and mayor braselton said it may bring in some tourists 
its easier to pick yankees than it is to pick cotton he said 
as he relaxed in a rocker in the family furniture store 
you cant stop progress we could have built braselton into an 
island and watched progress build up around us he said but i 
think we did the right thing

a critical time element was vigorously 
disputed as lawyers tried to answer how many hours capt joseph 
hazelwood spent drinking liquor before he took command of the exxon 
valdez on its fateful voyage 
a coast guard officers wife testified she saw hazelwood order a 
vodka on the rocks at a valdez bar about 145 pm on march 23 the 
skippers lawyers contend he didnt get to the bar until 4 pm 
he boarded the exxon valdez about 830 that night and the ship 
ran aground just after midnight causing the worst oil spill in 
us history 
janice delozier whose husband mark was one of the first coast 
guard officers to board the exxon valdez after it ran aground 
insisted hazelwood was the man she saw at the pipeline club and 
later recognized in a newspaper photo 
my immediate reaction was wow i saw him she testified 
she had told fbi and coast guard investigators she had gone to 
the club for coffee during her lunch hour when hazelwood arrived 
and ordered vodka on the rocks 
defense attorney michael chalos attacked her account noting 
that her husband was standing by and prompting her during her 
interview which was recorded she also acknowledged she had 
listened to the tape before testifying wednesday to ensure that her 
testimony was consistent 
she said she waited 10 days to come forward with her story 
because she feared people might find her involvement fishy 
given her husbands role in the case 
i didnt want anything to do with it said the woman who 
spoke rapidly in a thick southern accent and then there were the 
everpresent questions what were you doing in a bar she said 
she doubted people would believe she had gone there for coffee 
she portrayed the bar as a town gathering place where mens and 
womens darts teams staged competitions 
chalos and mrs delozier clashed when he asked how come she 
didnt discuss her recollection with the barmaid who she said 
waited on hazelwood 
theres no how come involved snapped mrs delozier im 
not the town crier 
she said another woman was at the bar that day but she didnt 
consult with her either because shes not the kind of young 
lady i hang out with 
chalos asked if it ever occurred to mrs delozier she might be 
mistaken in identifying hazelwood 
it has occurred to me sir she said 
asked if she tried to verify her identification she said i 
didnt feel i had to 
but if you had doubts chalos asked before the woman cut him 
off 
when did i say i had doubts i knew who i saw 100 percent 
she said i wouldnt be sitting here under oath if i had those 
doubts 
the attorney noted that in an interview with a state police 
investigator last week she placed hazelwood in the bar between 
1230 and 130 pm she said she was confused by the passage of 
time since the event 
she was followed to the witness stand by gretchen dunkin an 
administrative assistant at the alaska maritime agency in valdez 
who said she saw hazelwood leave for lunch with his shipmates at 
1230 pm and later encountered him at the pipeline club at about 
4 pm she said hazelwoods demeanor was unchanged from earlier in 
the day 
he seemed to be relaxed she said 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is accused of a felony 
seconddegree criminal mischief charge and misdemeanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated 
the maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years 
three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
the prosecution contends hazelwoods drunkenness contributed to 
the accident which spilled more than 10 million gallons of north 
slope crude oil into prince william sound killing thousands of 
birds fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of 
shore 
in a legal setback for the defense superior court judge karl 
johnstone allowed as evidence recordings of hazelwoods comments to 
the coast guard after he called to say we are aground and 
leaking some oil the defense had argued hazelwoods statements 
were exempt from use in a state court under federal law

officials in the government of ousted 
gen manuel antonio noriega made millions of dollars helping 
illegal aliens enter the united states the new immigration 
director said 
we knew there was corruption but we never imagined all the 
levels of corruption said the official jose chen barria 
chen said aliens from the dominican republic ecuador and peru 
obtained falsified documents to enter panama then went to 
guatemala mexico and the united states 
he said more than 45000 people including 11196 ecuadorians 
10502 peruvians 9241 dominicans and 7405 nicaraguans were 
smuggled into panama in 1989 he had no figures on how many people 
entered the united states this way 
the profits from this operation were enormous he said 
smuggling chinese brought in nearly 200 million in five 
years between november 1985 and 1989 20537 chinese entered the 
country paying an average of 5000 each chen said the 
business of smuggling chinese into panama could have generated 
between 50 million to 60 million 
from 1985 to 1989 10020 chinese left panama some of them with 
false documents going to the united states he said 
noriega was toppled in a dec 21 invasion by the united states 
which said it was protecting americans in panama and wanted to 
bring noriega to trial on us drug trafficking charges

the federal government has reversed a 
recent decision to ease the detention of central americans seeking 
asylum in the united states and said it hopes to stanch an 
increased flow of illegal aliens 
only those able to prove they are fleeing a wellfounded fear 
of persecution will be allowed to stay gene mcnary commissioner 
of the immigration and naturalization service announced wednesday 
he said an additional 11 million will be spent to bring in 
extra border patrol agents and immigration officials to stem the 
flow of new asylumseekers along the mexican border in texas 
to save money the ins last month lowered the population at the 
347acre detention center at bayview to less than 700 by freeing 
asylumseekers on their own recognizance to travel elsewhere in the 
united states while their cases were decided 
since that time im convinced that because of the gradual 
increase in people coming across the border that we need to put on 
a blitz mcnary said were not going to allow border 
crashing 
he said asylumseekers no longer would be released 
six large tents such as those used for state fairs have been 
erected raising the camps capacity to 2500 mcnary said the ins 
will build tents for 10000 if needed 
the bayview camp held 998 detainees wednesday mostly central 
americans another 632 people were detained at five other ins 
centers in southern texas 
a year ago the ins reduced the time it took to make asylum 
decisions to just one day when it was overwhelmed with more than 
500 applications for political asylum every day 
because most of the asylum requests were denied and those denied 
were put in deportation proceedings the number seeking refuge 
dropped to fewer than 10 a day at one point the bayview camps 
population topped 2400 
but the detention of aliens from countries other than mexico in 
october rose to 829 alone in the mcallen area of southern texas by 
january the figure had risen to 1860 mostly central americans 
said ins spokesman duke austin 
refugee advocates have speculated that a return of tensions 
especially in el salvador and nicaragua are responsible for the 
recent increase in immigrants from that region 
asylum is granted to those able to show they are fleeing a 
country because of political and not economic reasons ins 
officials say most central americans come to the united states to 
find work and therefore do not qualify 
mcnary told local officials there wouldnt be a repeat of the 
situation early last year when hundreds of central americans were 
camping in makeshift tents and in condemned buildings 
a group called the rio grande defense committee protested the 
new ins policy 
last year these tents became a symbol of injustice of 
summary asylum denials and coercive illegal conditions of 
confinement the group said in a leaflet handed out during 
mcnarys visit

a bounty hunter who himself was hunted for 
nearly four years after escaping from a courthouse is back behind 
bars awaiting trial on weapons and other charges 
george john koufos a police buff who couldnt become an officer 
because he had a lengthy criminal record taunted his pursuers and 
used several aliases as he stayed on the lam authorities said 
three years i waited for this man said the main pursuer 
anthony r strus an agent for the federal bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms 
he called koufos a master of deceit who within the past year 
even worked as a prison guard as he lived in boston and connecticut 
and shared an apartment in connecticut with a state highway 
department officer 
after his escape in march 1986 koufos once called federal 
agents to complain about wanted fliers posted in the new york city 
neighborhood where he was staying with his girlfriend strus said 
he said koufos also told the agents he saw strus enter a 
delicatessen across the street 
the bounty hunter was finally hunted down saturday in ellington 
conn 
connecticut state police had learned koufos was trying to set up 
another bounty hunting operation under the alias of john michael 
doyle it was unclear how they obtained the information 
on wednesday the 6foot1 300pound koufos appeared in us 
district court here bound in ankle and wrist shackles 
he pleaded innocent to a sixcount indictment charging him with 
failing to disclose a previous conviction and using fake drug 
enforcement administration credentials while buying guns a grand 
jury returned the indictment in august 
us district judge john bissell ordered him to remain in 
federal custody and set trial for april 2 
koufos also faces weapons charges in the new york city borough 
of brooklyn and in hartford conn and is accused of impersonating 
a federal agent in brooklyn and in boston strus said 
strus said koufos has used the names john kou george 
koufopoulos loannis koufo and most recently doyle strus said 
the most reliable birth date for the brooklynborn defendant is 
feb 9 1955 
koufos had a nearly 20year criminal record of larceny forgery 
assault and possession of stolen property preventing him from 
becoming a police officer said lawrence mcelynn a dea agent in 
washington dc 
so instead koufos got into the business of hunting down 
defendants who skip bail 
he seems to be the kind of fellow who is attracted to police 
work mcelynn said 
he acquired police techniques through a bounty hunters frequent 
contact with law enforcement authorities said assistant us 
attorney kevin mccarthy in newark 
in 1984 a judge in bridgeport conn sentenced koufos to five 
years in prison for an insurance scam but he was out in months 
after persuading the dea he could work as an informant court 
records show 
hell have you convinced that youre his brother if thats 
what he wants to convince you of said stamford conn police 
detective james van allen who investigated the insurance case 
soon after koufos and the dea agent assigned to him became 
partners in pursuing fugitives authorities said they were charged 
in elizabeth in 1985 with abducting the girlfriend of a bail jumper 
they were seeking charges against the agent were eventually 
dismissed and are pending against koufos 
around that time authorities lodged the weapons charges in 
newark but koufos disappeared 
in march 1986 strus and other agents arrested koufos in new 
york city while awaiting a hearing at a federal courthouse on the 
case he was left alone for a moment in a locked room koufos 
picked the lock and was free 
his attorney tonianne bongiovanni said koufos fled because of 
threats that if he went to prison inmates would be told of his 
cooperation 
he was fearful he would never come out alive she said 
ms bongiovanni said that koufos knew his arrest in connecticut 
was imminent and decided not to flee

chinese seeking to study overseas at their own 
expense will have to first work for several years in china or pay a 
large fee to the government a probeijing newspaper reported today 
the new restrictions come from the state education commission 
and take effect saturday the chineselanguage ta kung pao said in 
an article from beijing that quoted unnamed sources 
under the order university and college graduates will have to 
serve china for three to five years before being allowed to 
study overseas at their own expense the report said 
it did not say precisely what type of work was expected 
in addition chinese still in school will be allowed to apply to 
study overseas only after repaying the government for public money 
already spent on their education 
fees will range from 1500 yuan 318 per school year for 
students at professional training colleges to 6000 yuan 1271 
per school year for chinese studying for a doctorate 
the average annual urban wage in china is about 255 
the newspaper said the money would be returned to students if 
they come back to china within eight years of going abroad 
in explaining the reason for the new regulations the article 
said only that they were drafted in the spirit of discussions held 
by the sixmember politburo standing committee of the ruling 
communist party 
fear of students not returning home particularly after the 
brutal crackdown on the prodemocracy movement last year is one 
reason for chinas more stringent rules on study overseas 
the government also is concerned that too many students are 
returning home with antisocialist ideas that could undermine 
the communist revolution 
sources in the education bureaucracy in beijing had earlier told 
the associated press of regulations being circulated internally to 
bar anyone under 30 years of age or with less than five years of 
work experience from obtaining official sponsorship to study 
overseas 
other measures have made it more difficult for students to take 
tests for study abroad and to obtain passports without official 
sponsorship

federal health officials are considering a ban 
on mercury in paint after a 4yearold boy became severely disabled 
after inhaling it in his home 
we think there is a potential for exposure and a potential for 
risk said dr ruth etzel a pediatrician at the governments 
centers for disease control in atlanta 
she said the agency is considering a recommendation to ban the 
use of mercury in paints to prevent bacterial growth and mildew a 
decision could come as early as next week she said 
the concern is heightened by the fact that mercury need not be 
added to paint because safer alternatives are available she said 
if there is a preventable source of exposure to mercury we 
ought to try to prevent exposure etzel said 
the environmental protection agency also has launched an urgent 
investigation said dr renate kimbrough of the epa in washington 
dc we are trying to get as rapidly as possible as much 
information together as we can 
the case that triggered the investigation occurred last summer 
in detroit the boy developed severe neurological problems and 
became unable to walk the condition is called acrodynia or pink 
disease 
he was hospitalized until just before christmas said david 
wade a toxicologist with the michigan department of agriculture 
which regulates mercury as a pesticide 
its not known whether the boy would recover fully wade said 
its going to be a long recovery wade said there is a 
lot of physical therapy that will be involved 
an investigation showed the paint contained levels of phenyl 
mercuric acetate higher than the law allows wade said the boys 
family has sued the paints manufacturer the mercury paint co of 
detroit 
the issue is whether anything in the paint harmed the child 
which we dont believe it did said charles soberman president 
of mercury paint 
its not a question of a formulation when you have one 
alleged incident in the 70year history of a company that hardly 
creates an imminent health hazard in our opinion 
pink disease was relatively common from the 1920s through the 
1940s etzel said it disappeared when scientists found it was 
caused by a widely used teething powder containing mercury 
she said it is possible however that the disease is occurring 
more frequently than doctors realize but is being misdiagnosed 
many younger physicians have never seen a case etzel said 
it produces a rash similar to those caused by rheumatic fever an 
ailment called kawasaki disease and even measles she said doctors 
unfamiliar with pink disease might be diagnosing it as one of 
these she said 
the michigan health department issued an advisory in october 
warning consumers not to use paints with high levels of mercury in 
january the department asked the epa to review the evidence on 
mercury exposure and consider banning its use in paint 
we have initiated a review said tina levine a toxicologist 
at the epa it has a very high priority the concern is not 
only for children who might be exposed but for other groups such 
as painters she said 
she noted that the detroit case was unusual because it involved 
paint in which the levels of mercury were about three times higher 
than allowed about 300 parts per million 
dr charles cubbage of the michigan department of agriculture 
said that levels of mercury exposure that might be safe for one 
child could cause pink disease in another 
its what we call an idiosyncratic disease he said if 
you have a group of children exposed to the same level of mercury 
they wont all get it

schools have tried banning beepers jewelry and 
short skirts now a principal has gone one better he ordered his 
students to polish up their image by yanking the gold caps from 
their teeth 
you cant go to wall street with gold teeth or excessive gold 
jewelry principal frank mickens told a student assembly 
wednesday you can be a drug dealer you can be a prostitute you 
can be a pimp 
when the freshman assembly at boys and girls high school in 
brooklyn rumbled with protest mickens said students who dont want 
to comply can transfer to another school 
in dealing with black and hispanic young people i teach them 
they have to be beyond reproach people have to look at them and 
immediately know they are dealing with a good young person said 
mickens who is black 
the order furthers a trend in which schools have banned 
electronic beepers which students have been used for 
communicating with drug dealers and pricey clothes and jewelry 
in order to promote education over conspicuous consumption and to 
prevent the students being victimized by thieves 
three years ago mickens banned excessive gold jewelry short 
skirts personal tape players and shearling coats also were 
forbidden 
the school once regarded as one of new yorks worst is in a 
section of the bedfordstuyvesant area stricken with crime and 
drugs 
now 70 percent of the seniors continue with their education 
after graduation 
obahdavid ward president of the schools parent teacher and 
community association said parents support mickens who is 
setting kids in the right direction 
our students are placing the accent on the wrong thing the 
gold here and the gold there the right shoes the right dress we 
want the emphasis to be on education ward said 
the caps a fad first started by drug dealers wanting to flash 
their wealth cost between 40 and 100 and are more popular with 
boys than girls 
erskine tillery a 16yearold sophomore with two gold caps on 
his front teeth said he would follow the order because he probably 
would be safer from gold thieves 
people will shoot you if they dont come out he said

details of a major new study showing that a 
veterinary drug is the first medicine to save the lives of people 
with advanced operable colon cancer should presuade doctors to 
offer the treatment a researcher contends 
dr charles g moertel of the mayo clinic estimates that routine 
use of this approach for all potential patients could save about 
5000 lives annually 
doctors from the national cancer institute sent letters to 
doctors outlining the findings last fall but the first indepth 
account of the research appears in todays issue of the new england 
journal of medicine 
the data in this large trial are just overwhelmingly 
convincing said moertel who directed the study 
the treatment uses levamisole which is ordinarily given to 
deworm farm animals and the standard cancer medicine 
fluorouracil when tested on 1296 colon cancer patients it 
reduced cancer recurrence by 41 percent and it lowered the death 
rate by onethird 
in october the cancer institute wrote letters to about 35000 
doctors describing the findings of this and a smaller earlier 
study that was published in the journal of clinical oncology 
however some doctors remained skeptical 
with publication in a prestigious journal they will review 
this information and decide it is worth trying predicted dr 
michael friedman chief of the cancer institutes therapy 
evaluation program 
levamisole is not commercially available in the united states 
for human use however since may the cancer institute has 
distributed it without cost to physicians who wanted to use it for 
colon cancer 
moertel said that about onethird of potential patients are 
getting it this way another onethird with advanced operable colon 
cancer are enrolled in experimental drug studies and some of them 
are also receiving levamisole as well as other medicines 
moertel said some doctors are probably not using the medicine 
because of the extra paper work necessary to obtain it for 
patients while others were reluctant to adopt the therapy until 
they saw detailed results 
last week the oncologic drugs advisory committee of the us 
food and drug administration unanimously recommended that janssen 
pharmaceutica inc be given permission to sell the medicine for 
routine use eva kemper an fda spokeswoman said wednesday that 
final approval should come within a month or so 
of the 110000 americans diagnosed with colon cancer annually 
about 22000 have stage c disease their cancer has spread to 
nearby lymph nodes but can still be removed surgically 
moertel said that 95 percent of stage c patients should receive 
the twodrug combination 
at the present time with the known rate of occurrence of c 
stage colon cancer this could translate into saving about 5000 
lives annually who would now die of recurrent colon cancer he 
said 
studies are also under way to see if the treatment saves the 
lives of people with less advanced colon cancer that has spread 
into the wall of the colon but not invaded lymph nodes

nicolae ceausescus ban on 
contraception is being blamed for romanias epidemic of aids among 
children most of whom contracted the deadly disease through blood 
transfusions to treat malnourishment 
government officials say aids was a state secret under the 
ousted communist dictator and they now are publicizing the problem 
to gain international help to fight the disease 
health minister dan enachescu said wednesday that romania has 
about 74 confirmed cases of aids including 50 children about 600 
romanians carry the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which 
causes aids he said 
he did not say how many people were tested for the virus or how 
many had died of the disease 
earlier wednesday dr jonathan mann the head of aids programs 
for the world health organization said more than 700 children in 
romania were infected with the virus 
he said in a us television interview that an emergency who 
medical team sent to romania is still trying to figure out 
exactly how this has happened and particularly what steps must be 
taken immediately to stop this now 
doctors blame romanias outbreak of pediatric aids on 
contaminated blood transfusions and the constant reuse of needles 
at hospitals elsewhere in the world most children with aids have 
contracted it from their mothers while in the womb 
disposable needles have been in short supply in romania and 
foreign governments and charities are now pledging to sent several 
million disposable hypodermic syringes 
enachescu said that because of ceausescus ban on contraception 
there are 14000 abandoned children in romania many were given 
small blood transfusions to treat malnourishment and the 
transfusions proved to be a main source of passing on the aids 
virus he said 
enachescu said the health ministry had only halted such 
transfusions on jan 5 
but he said that in some orphanages and hospitals in bucharest 
the black sea port of constanza and the danube port of giurgi 
there is between 15 and 50 percent of children who have the 
aids virus 
other towns have reported no cases and a nationwide survey must 
be conducted for a more complete picture of the epidemic enachescu 
said 
dr jacques lebas president of the parisbased humanitarian 
organization doctors of the world said monday that the outbreak 
was the first known aids epidemic to involve mainly children and 
that an initial screening of 1025 children up to 3 years old in 
several hospitals and orphanages found 367 with the hiv virus 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys 
immune system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers a person can carry the hiv virus for years 
without having aids but in almost all cases it leads to the 
disease 
there is no known cure for aids 
enachescu said the government was completing a national program 
for the treatment and control of the disease 
ceausescu who was toppled in a bloody popular revolution and 
executed on christmas day banned contraception because he wanted 
continuous population growth 
enachescu said romania has enough equipment to test blood in 
bucharest for aids for the next two months but needs more 
equipment as well as disposable needles 
britain announced wednesday that it was sending a million 
syringes to help fight the epidemic americares the usbased 
medical relief organization also said it would send a million 
syringes 
dr alex gromyko a soviet based in copenhagen and an expert on 
the medical aspects of aids said its enormous what has to be 
done to get an adequate idea of the extent of the problem 
he said the first case of aids in romania was reported in 1985 
but until october 1989 only 10 cases were reported 
last month dr ludovic paun of the infectious diseases 
department at bucharests victor babes hospital said 69 people 
treated there had developed aids since 1985 including 53 young 
children 
he said 33 of the 45 aids fatalities so far had been children 3 
years old or younger

prosecutors believe theyve cracked open an 
underworld crime syndicate with the indictments of 20 alleged 
mobsters in the slayings of three bookmakers who wouldnt pay the 
mobs street taxes 
obviously this was a powerful group of individuals said 
acting us attorney ira raphaelson citing what he said was their 
willingness to kill and their many years of operating the rackets 
the government said those indicted by a federal grand jury were 
engaged in illegal gambling highinterest loans and the collection 
of street taxes fees to the syndicate for the privilege of 
running criminal activities several are accused of using murder 
and extortion as enforcement tactics 
prosecutors called the indictments a rare solution of underworld 
murders 
those indicted raphaelson said operated as the joseph ferriola 
street crew a segment of chicagos crime syndicate a notorious 
group of gangsters harking back to the days of al capone 
the prosecutor refused to say how many street crews are believed 
to operate in chicago how big a role the ferriola crew played in 
the mob or whether the indictments were expected to reduce crime in 
the city 
rocco infelise 67 of suburban river forest who allegedly 
became boss after ferriolas death last year is charged 
racketeering conspiracy to commit murder illegal gambling and tax 
cheating 
also charged with racketeering is salvatore delaurentis 52 of 
suburban inverness 
the fbi said infelise and delaurentis were arrested wednesday at 
ohare international airport when they arrived from florida of the 
18 other defendants all but one had been arrested 
the government is seeking forfeiture of the homes of infelise 
and delaurentis and 37 million in proceeds from alleged 
racketeering activities 
some of defendants also are accused of conspiring to bribe 
public officials in illinois to protect the street crew and of 
planning to bribe officials in wisconsin 
raphaelson said there isnt any indication the wisconsin plans 
were realized or that any wisconsin officials knew about the plan 
according to the indictment anthony reitinger was fatally shot 
in chicago in 1975 robert plummer was beaten to death in the 
libertyville suburb in 1982 and hal smith was strangled in suburban 
long grove in 1985 
veteran defense attorney patrick tuite noted that he represented 
some of the same defendants against similar charges in 1984 and 
the jury said not guilty 
the indictment contains 42 counts against the 20 defendants

pop singer stevie wonders academy 
awardwinning song i just called to say i love you was written 
by two other people and stolen by wonder after it was played for 
him a lawyer charged 
songwriter lloyd chiate 40 claims he and collaborator lee 
garrett wrote the song in the 1970s and titled it i just called 
to say wonder says he wrote the song himself before the pair 
composed their song 
wonder who was born steveland morris is being sued in federal 
court for alleged copyright infringement by chiate 
we are going to prove to you that mr morris took the song 
written by mr chiate and mr garrett for his own benefit and 
mr chiate received nothing attorney herbert dodell said 
wednesday in opening statements as wonder sat in the courtroom 
but wonders attorney howard king said the pop star wrote the 
songs chorus on july 16 1976 as he returned from a visit with 
his mother in the san fernando valley before chiate and garret 
ever met 
he said wonder completed the song in 1984 after hearing part of 
the soundtrack to the film the woman in red 
king added that garrett who dropped out as a plaintiff in the 
case has acknowledged that wonder actually wrote the song

public schools were ordered closed for a 
second day today as a racial dispute flared over white management 
of the mostly black school system in this 1960s battleground of the 
civil rights movement 
on wednesday about 500 people chanting soul power and i 
am somebody marched on city hall in support of norward roussell 
selmas first black superintendent 
the whitedominated school board dismissed roussell from his 
80000ayear job last week but reinstated him amid protests and 
he returned to the job wednesday 
the six white members of the 11member board cited an evaluation 
critical of roussells managerial skills as the basis for 
dismissing him roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated 
protest leaders who want an elected board rather than the 
current board appointed by the whitemajority city council said 
roussell was being fired only because he is black 
the marchers demanded roussell be given a threeyear contract 
his contract expires in june 
if we cant get that were going to be marching said 
attorney carlos williams a protest organizer 
the board closed all 11 public schools in selmas 70 percent 
black 6000student system after scuffles broke out between white 
and black students tuesday morning 
roussell met wednesday for about two hours with principals and 
his central office staff and said the schools would remain closed 
today and until we are able to assure the safety and security of 
our students and staff 
everyone needs to cool down a bit roussell said 
the closings prompted some white parents upset with the racial 
turmoil to transfer their children to selmas two allwhite 
private schools 
weve run out of room in our sixthgrade classes and ive had 
to turn down some parents said lee holladay headmaster at 
meadowview christian school he said 15 pupils have enrolled at the 
school since tuesday 
about 170 parents attended an informal discussion wednesday 
night at selma high school 
i think its important to note that 80 percent of the students 
in the community want to be in school said one parent diane 
crisman if 20 percent want to boycott let them but keep them 
off school property 
state sen hank sanders meanwhile said wednesday he would use 
any means necessary to respond personally to what he described 
as police abuse of his wife rose during a protest monday over 
roussells firing 
mrs sanders wearing a neck brace with one arm in a sling 
spoke from a wheelchair at a hospital wednesday saying she was 
hurt when she was carried bodily from mayor joe smithermans office 
by police after a melee there 
she and three other blacks were charged with misdemeanors 
jl chestnut one of mrs sanders law partners filed a 
complaint alleging that her civil rights were violated

a boy who was raped mutilated and left for 
dead jumped into his mothers arms and yelled success after 
he found out a former mental patient was convicted in the attack 
the woman said 
the boy remained in his secondgrade class wednesday and was 
picked up by his parents after the conviction of earl kenneth 
shriner 
under state sentencing guidelines shriner who had a long 
history of violence toward young people could be ordered 
imprisoned 99 years but pierce county prosecutors said they would 
ask superior court judge thomas r sauriol to go beyond that range 
we want to see that he never walks the streets again said 
deputy prosecutor james roche 
shriner faces sentencing march 26 for raping the then7yearold 
boy cutting off his penis and leaving him for dead in woods near 
their south tacoma homes 
shriner looked frightened when the jury returned the verdict 
he gulped and bit his lower lip as the guilty announcements were 
read guilty of firstdegree attempted murder two counts of 
firstdegree rape and firstdegree assault 
lloyde alton shriners courtappointed attorney said he would 
seek a new trial 
ms harlow said she the boys father lowell and friends 
celebrated at her house by dancing to the music of black sabbath 
and acdc shaking gold pompons and shouting rah rah rah 
guilty guilty guilty 
he jumped into my arms and said we got it success she 
said 
i was happy the 8yearold boy told the morning news 
tribune as he got ready for bed im glad that hes in jail now 
and i sat down and watched tv 
the attack may 20 created an uproar in the state about sex 
predators 
the legislature is close to enacting legislation calling for 
longer sentences civil commitment and registration of sex 
offenders the law was drafted by a governors task force on which 
the boys mother had served 
ms harlow who has testified before the legislature said she 
looked forward to the continued recovery of her son 
praise god its over and it went like we were told she said 
a trust fund established with donations has financed extensive 
corrective surgery for the boy but he faces more operations when 
he approaches adulthood 
deputy prosecutor barbara coreyboulet said the extensive 
publicity which complicated jury selection and resulted in heavy 
courtroom security would help focus attention on other sex crime 
victims especially girls who internalize their fears 
their cases dont get the attention they deserve here you 
have a horrible visible injury coreyboulet said i think the 
legislative furor will help other victims 
jury forewoman susan barker 30 said the attempted murder 
charge was the main issue in nearly five hours of deliberations 
that began tuesday the judge told jurors that to convict shriner 
of attempted murder they had to agree that shriner intended to 
kill the boy 
another juror timothy jacobson said the grim nature of the 
case took its toll during deliberations i know some of them had 
trouble sleeping he said i know i had trouble one or two 
nights getting my mind quieted down 
shriner has a 24year history of violent attacks on young 
people he has been confined at rainier school for the retarded 
western state hospital a mental institution and the washington 
corrections center but the jury was barred from hearing of his 
background 
neighbors found the boy naked bloody covered with mud and 
practically incoherent soon after the attack 
a fellow jail inmate testified that shriner admited mutilating 
the boy 
dolores shriner the defendants mother cried when she heard 
the verdict on leaving the courtroom she said how would you 
feel if you were his mother

a bankrupt florida attorney who 
prosecutors say blamed a multimillionaire for his financial woes 
was convicted by a federal jury in the 1988 disappearance of the 
mans wife 
the jury found newton alfred winn 65 guilty of one count each 
of conspiracy to kidnap extortion and perjury wednesday after 
about 3 hours of deliberation 
winn was charged with extortion and lying to a federal grand 
jury about his knowledge of the disappearance of annie laurie 
hearin on july 26 1988 he also was accused of conspiracy in 
having a ransom letter mailed from atlanta 
no one has been charged with actually abducting the 74yearold 
woman whose search is still active 
winn who faces sentencing april 13 sat impassively as the 
jurors were polled 
i think we deserve the verdict assistant us attorney 
james tucker said the proof was there 
in his closing arguments tucker said that winn was a 
desperate man who carried out the kidnapping conspiracy only 
days before his law office in st petersburg fla was to be shut 
down 
defense attorneys said the government has the wrong man john 
collette one of winns attorneys said an appeal is likely 
when asked if he had a statement after the verdict winn held 
out his hands in a questioning manner and said what is there to 
say 
the government claimed that winn blamed robert hearin for his 
financial losses in school pictures of mississippi inc in which 
hearin was a primary stockholder and former chairman prosecutors 
said the business deal led winn to his bankruptcy and the loss of 
his law office 
found at the hearin home was a spattering of blood on the front 
door and another ransom note demanding that hearin reimburse 12 
people including winn for losses they suffered in deals with 
school pictures 
mrs hearin hasnt been seen since she disappeared from her 
jackson home following a bridge party with friends doctors have 
said the woman had a health problem that required daily medication 
the investigation into whatever happened to my mother is 
continuing and on that basis i am pleased with the result reached 
today robert hearin jr said after the verdict was read 
on hand for jury instructions and final arguments were two key 
government witnesses don ward who once worked for winn and 
marilyn taylor who describes herself as a onetime lover of the 
defendant and who has testified that she mailed aug 11 1988 a 
letter which prosecutors say was a ransom note 
defense attorney ed marger told the jury that the conspiracy 
could have been created by taylor and ward or by hearins children 
to get some money that they didnt get at this time

attorney general steve clark bowed out 
of the race for arkansas governor after authorities told him they 
were investigating erroneous expense claims he filed with the state 
clark read a brief statement wednesday announcing his withdrawal 
as a candidate for the democratic nomination but said he would not 
leave office as the states attorney general a post he has held 
for 12 years 
clark 42 wouldnt answer questions but his statement claimed 
innocence of any deliberate wrongdoing 
on tuesday prosecutor chris piazza officially notified clark 
that state police and auditors were looking into his expenses 
earlier news reports said people claimed by clark as fellow 
diners on state expense forms actually never ate with him 
clark said last week he was repaying the state nearly 4000 
that had gone unreported because of sloppy bookkeeping he said he 
had tried to reconstruct his use of a stateissued visa card 60 to 
90 days after the fact 
news reports said the expenseclaim errors exceed 4000 and may 
surpass 8000 
after much reflection and discussion with my family and 
friends i have reached the conclusion that the mistakes in my 
expense records and subsequent news coverage about those mistakes 
have virtually destroyed my ability to run an efficient and 
effective campaign for governor clark said 
i therefore must with profound regret withdraw as a 
candidate for governor he said as i complete the remainder of 
my term as attorney general i pledge to serve the people of 
arkansas with honor and dignity 
clark said last week it was an honest mistake but i made a 
mistake im sorry and i apologize 
col tommy goodwin state police director said three state 
police officers have been assigned to the legislative audit staff 
to determine if any criminal activity occurred

the ruling communist party rejecting the reforms 
undoing communist rule in the former soviet empire said today that 
it has no intention of surrendering its monopoly on power and 
claimed overwhelming popular support 
a strongly worded editorial in the partys official peoples 
daily made no mention of the soviet communist partys decision 
wednesday to end its constitutional guarantee of leadership 
but the commentary was an obvious response to soviet and eastern 
european moves toward multiparty political systems it branded 
western democracies as playthings of the rich 
the nationally televised evening news today reported at length 
but without commentary on the soviet communist party meeting 
however it made only passing mention at the end of the 
fourminute report of the decision to abolish the partys leading 
role and instead quoted mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet 
leaders as defending socialism and the party 
it was the first detailed report in the official media of the 
meeting a shanghai newspaper monday ran a brief report without 
saying the partys leadership was in question 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua asked at a weekly 
briefing today about the soviet decision and how it would affect 
sinosoviet relations said only that this is the internal affair 
of the soviet union 
china has taken a sharply divergent path crushing its 
prodemocracy movement last spring and then launching a campaign 
against all dissent and criticism of the party 
the peoples daily editorial said china without the party would 
mean turmoil and war national division and suffering for the 
people the whole nation has endorsed the correct leadership of 
the communist party it said 
under the party the chinese people have been able to hold 
their heads high withstand various invasions and pressure from 
imperialism and foreign forces and safeguard the dignity of the 
motherland 
without the leadership of the communist party of china armed 
with marxism leninism and mao tsetung thought you cannot begin 
to talk about building socialism in china it said 
the editorial concerned a party document released wednesday 
urging greater cooperation with eight tiny and powerless 
democratic parties and promoting chinas system of oneparty 
rule with input from noncommunist parties and mass organizations 
the elite who stirred up the counterrevolutionary 
rebellion the official term for the prodemocracy movement of 
last spring sought to deprive the party of its leading role and 
establish westernstyle parliamentary democracy it said 
some people it said always think that the parliamentary 
democracy in the west is advantageous 
but it claimed western democracies were controlled by the rich 
and the broad masses of working people have never had the right 
to take part in the administration of state affairs those who 
have more money will have more freedom and have more right to talk 
in the democracy such democracy means nothing to those who do not 
have enough to eat 
the editorial urged the party leadership to study the document 
released wednesday which said the democratic parties and 
noncommunists should get more legislative and bureaucratic 
positions and have a voice in policymaking 
the party has a lock on all leadership positions and absolute 
power over policy but the document said our democratic system 
still needs to be perfected and the party must listen to 
different opinions 
the democratic parties now number about 300000 with their 
ranks comprised mainly of leftist intellectuals from pre1949 days 
many now in their 80s 
the communist party has 48 million members 
all eight parties pledge allegiance to communist party rule and 
no new parties have been recognized in the past four decades

a woman questioned in the investigation of carol 
stuarts slaying says police offered her a vacation and relocation 
of her family to make her account conform to theirs that a black 
man committed the crime 
the boston globe today reported that mary smith said police also 
threatened to put her daughter in juvenile detention unless she 
said what they wanted to hear 
they treated me like i was nobody smith said they tried 
to put words in my mouth 
paul k leary first assistant district attorney said it would 
be inappropriate to comment on smiths charges because allegations 
of police misconduct are being investigated by the attorney general 
charles stuart told police a black mugger shot him and killed 
his pregnant wife oct 23 after the white couple left a 
childbirthing class on jan 4 stuart apparently jumped to his 
death after one of his brothers implicated him in the shootings 
before stuarts death wiliam bennett a black man was placed 
in a lineup and implicated in the slaying 
smith told the globe that she saw bennett on the night of the 
shooting with what looked like a silver gun stuart had described 
the assailants weapon as a silver gun 
smith 43 said police pressured her into making her description 
of the clothes worn by bennett fit a description stuart gave police 
of an assailant 
the case raised racial tensions in boston and called into 
question the fairness of the news media and the police 
smith is the fourth person to come forward and accuse police of 
misconduct in their investigation three teenagers have said 
police coerced them into giving testimony 
at one meeting smith said police promised to make a deal with 
her if she would implicate bennett and to relocate her family to 
springfield 
they said if i dont answer any questions they would put my 
daughter in juvenile detention she said

the idea of an official state soil and has given the nod to sandy 
kalkaska sod 
house members voted 8614 wednesday to honor the kalkaska soil

wouldnt have anything said rep richard sofio of bessemer the

waves of civilians scurried out of 
embattled east beirut to the citys western sector today during a 
relative lull in the battle by rival christian forces for control 
of the countrys christian enclave 
police said the respite was used by gen michel aoun and 
lebanese forces militia chieftan samir geagea to add ammunition and 
weapons to areas under their control in devastated east beirut and 
kesrouan province 
the 10day fight for predominance in the 310squaremile 
christian enclave north and northeast of beirut has killed 373 
people and wounded 1680 by police count 
police said a lieutenant in aouns army was killed by a snipers 
bullet in east beiruts district of dora today and the st joseph 
hospital said seven civilians wounded in the savage fighting 
earlier this week died 
civilians emerged from bomb shelters and hospitals sought to 
replenish depleted stocks of food fuel water oxygen blood and 
medicines 
at the museum crossing the only open link between the mainly 
christian and moslem halves of beirut an exodus was under way 
hundreds of civilians emerged from the narrow alleys of the 
ashrafiyeh district scene of some of the heaviest fighting and 
stumbled through the nomansland at the crossing 
my life is more precious than my house said george bido a 
72yearold grocer who left ashrafiyeh with his wife headed for 
damascus via west beirut 
we collected rain water in canisters and drank it to remain 
alive mrs bido said crying i dont know if well ever come 
back 
other christians flooded the gateway to purchase bread 
vegetables fruits and drinking water from dozens of moslem vendors 
who parked their trucks nearby 
i cant wait to get the bread to the family said youssef 
hayek a resident of furn elshubbak 
aouns soldiers armed with usmade m16 automatic rifles 
did not interfere with civilians leaving ashrafiyeh but snipers 
halted traffic trying to enter geageas area of influence by 
shooting at them 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said geageas engineering units used rocks cement and 
mines to block a 500yard tunnel separating their positions from 
aouns lines at the dog river valley north of beirut 
the tunnel is on the coastal highway linking the aounheld town 
of dbaye with main bases of geageas lebanese forces militia in 
kesrouan byblos and batroun farther north 
the move appears aimed at blocking aouns usmade m48 tanks 
aoun has 20000 army troops but his force has been unable to 
quell geageas 6000member lebanese forces 
in east beirut geageas men are entrenched in two isolated 
strongholds the western ashrafiyehkarantina area next to beirut 
port and ein rummaneh on the citys southeastern edge police 
reported sporadic sniper fire today 
the police spokesman said geageas men were seen early in the 
day filling sand bags and planting additional antitank and 
antipersonnel mines along the southern slopes of the ashrafiyeh 
district which face aouns tanks 
both sides are believed to have enough weapons stockpiled to 
fight for months 
the newspaper annahar said the fighting might stop if geagea 
accepts aouns offer to dismantle the militia and become a 
political party 
aoun told a news conference wednesday that geagea was trying to 
enforce implementation of an arab leaguebrokered peace plan to end 
the nations 14yearold civil war 
the accord worked out by lebanese legislators in taif saudi 
arabia in october was rejected by aoun appointed earlier last 
year to head an interim government by former president amin gemayel 
aoun has refused to recognize the nov 24 election of president 
elias hrawi to oversee implementaion of the pact geagea supports 
hrawi but has not commented on the accord 
aoun geagea and hrawi are maronites the catholic community 
that has dominated political life in lebanon since independence 
from france in 1943 
hrawi has hinted at requesting help from the syrians who 
support him but their intervention would need advance 
international approval on tuesday hrawi appealed to western 
nations the soviet union the united nations and the arab world 
for help in ending the fighting 
the syrian soldiers were deployed in lebanon in 1976 to quell 
civil war fighting aoun says they violated their peacekeeping 
mandate by siding with the moslems in the civil war 
he has demanded that the syrians leave the country last year 
his forces fought artillery battles with them

death threats against nelson 
mandela from left and rightwing extremists are among the factors 
delaying the black leaders release from prison a government 
minister said today 
we want to ensure he walks out of that prison a free man and 
lives safely in this country as a free citizen law and order 
minister adriaan vlok told a news conference he also said the 
3yearold state of emergency must be maintained to give police 
extra powers in dealing with unrest and preventing extremists from 
sabotaging president fw de klerks reforms 
we would like to lift the emergency as soon as possible but 
its not possible now vlok said 
gerrit viljoen the cabinet minister in charge of setting up 
negotiations with black leaders said in an interview with the abc 
news network in the united sates that the emergency will last only 
a few more weeks because the government realizes it is inhibiting 
normalization of the political process 
in port elizabeth south africas fifthlargest city 50000 to 
80000 blacks marched peacefully to a government education office 
to protest inadequacies in black education a petition presented to 
education officials demanded the construction of new schools 
reforms in university admission policies and repeal of apartheid 
legislation 
the rev allan boesak a top antiapartheid leader said today 
that the 71yearold mandela must be released very soon or people 
will start questioning the governments commitment to end white 
minority rule 
if the release of mr mandela is not a fact within the next 
week or two the world will start to question if mr de klerk is 
really serious he told the associated press in an interview 
the government appears to be dithering over a release date 
because it still hopes to persuade mandela to take a less critical 
position once he is released the clergyman said 
without giving details vlok said mandela had been threatened by 
rightwing extremists and by hardliners within leftist black 
groups unhappy over his attempts to negotiate with the white 
minority government 
he said some of the threats were several years old there had 
always been rightwing threats against mandela but now vlok said 
police had received intelligence reports that mandela was at risk 
from elements within his own organization the african national 
congress the anc has rejected such accusations by vlok in the past 
de klerk announced major reforms feb 2 to try and start talks 
on ending white minority rule and bringing blacks into the 
political process he legalized the anc and other antiapartheid 
grops and promised to free mandela soon but lifted only certain 
sections of the state of emergency 
mandela wants an immediate end to the state of emergency and the 
release of all political prisoners before he leaves prison or he 
will question the governments commitment to reform when he is 
free boesak said 
boesak said mandela was not delaying his release and the 
question of when he is freed is entirely up to the government he 
is a prisoner of the south african government boesak said 
vlok said some elements of the state of emergency must be kept 
to guard against the higher revolutionary climate now facing 
south africa 
he specifically mentioned the need to retain regulations giving 
the police powers of mass arrest and mass detention but said they 
would only be used in extreme circumstances 
the minister said the police were fully committed to de klerks 
plans and rejected opposition conservative party claims that the 
security forces opposed sharing power with blacks and are turning 
against the government 
another demand of the anc as a condition for possible 
negotiations with the government is the removal of army units 
from black townships 
deputy defense minister wynand breytenbach told journalists 
there were less than 800 troops assigned to black residential areas 
at present these units acted only in support of police and in 
some cases were welcomed by residents as a help in reducing black 
factional violence breytenbach said

the kashmir valley shot and killed two paramilitary policemen today 
while they were shopping for groceries in a suburb of srinagar the 
government said 
witnesses to the shooting however said they saw three bodies 
being carried away after the incident they said the policemen were 
buying vegetables when they were gunned down in bursts of automatic 
rifle fire 
the shopkeeper and a bystander were injured they said 
a government statement said two policemen of the paramilitary 
border security force were killed and a civilian injured in the 
chanpora suburb of the city by moslem militants 
the deaths raise to 81 the number of people killed in 
confrontations between security forces and the militants since the 
government launched a crackdown jan 20 on the moslem movement for 
secession of kashmir from india where hindus are in the majority 
the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said police 
immediately imposed a curfew in chanpora and launched search 
operations for the assailants 
it was not immediately known how many people were involved in 
the attack 
meanwhile jammukashmir state gov jagmohan appealed for peace 
in the valley and called on the militants to give up their campaign 
let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the 
futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of 
allround misery that it has caused he said in a letter released 
by the state government 
let us assure them that if they abandon the path of violence 
we would treat them with care and compassion he said 
the letter was written by jagmohan who uses only one name to 
the father of a moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in 
a shopping complex on wednesday 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan after the two countries were partitioned upon becoming 
independent from britain in 1947 srinagar and the surrounding 
valley became part of jammukashmir state the only state in india 
with a moslem majority 
a western slice of kashmir is controlled by pakistan along a 
ceasefire line where indian and pakistani troops face each other 
sometimes at distances of only a few hundred yards 
the two countries have gone to war three times twice over 
kashmir 
india accuses pakistan of fomenting the current trouble in 
kashmir a charge pakistan routinely denies 
nationwide moslems comprise 12 percent of indias 880 million 
people but they make up only 65 percent of jammukashmirs 5 
million people

continent said a nato statement presented to reporters by the 
danish delegation to the talks one area where this is most 
relevant is manpower 
it said the 16 nations had reviewed their positions and now feel 
it is appropriate to lower the westernproposed ceiling for us 
and soviet stationed manpower 
to that end we now propose that neither the united states nor 
the soviet union shall station more than 195000 ground and air 
force personnel each within the area comprising the territory of 
belgium czechoslovakia denmark the federal republic of germany 
the german democratic republic hungary luxembourg the 
netherlands and poland the statement said 
the troops removed should be demobilized the statement added

british and other troops stationed in the central european zone 
would be unaffected by such an accord 
under the bush plan proposed during his state of the union 
address the united states would maintain an overall limit of 
225000 soldiers in europe including forces in britain and 
southern europe 
in may bush suggested an overall ceiling of 275000 troops for 
both sides 
the soviet union has about 565000 troops stationed in europe 
outside its national territory more than 500000 of them in the 
central zone the united states has 305000 troops in western 
europe with 250000 in the central zone 
hungary and czechoslovakia have begun talks with the soviets

the end of this year the hungarians want the 50000 soviet 
soldiers to leave before the end of next year

but they reportedly argue they need more time to accommodate the 
manpower back home

premier andrei lukanov today presented to 
parliament his new government packed with communist academics but 
he failed to persuade any members of the democratic opposition to 
join it

from the rule of ousted communist leader todor zhivkov 
unexpectedly resigned feb 1 during the extraordinary congress of 
the ruling communist party where atanasov was accused of economic 
mismanagement and other shortcomings 
this will be a government of national interest which is ready 
to cooperate with all political forces lukanov told the national 
assembly according to bulgarian state radio 
the communists had called for a government of national 
concord comprising representatives from all social forces in 
this balkan country of 9 million people 
but after the opposition union of democratic forces repeatedly 
rejected the communist partys offer to participate in the new 
government the agrarian party until recently a docile ally of the 
communists said wednesday it would no longer be part of a 
communistdominated cabinet 
that left lukanov little choice in selecting new ministers 
it was not immediately clear from the list of ministers if any 
of them were noncommunists 
but the government as presented to the national assembly did 
not include any known members of the union of democratic forces or 
the agrarian party 
lukanov a multilingual economist with years of diplomatic 
experience was widely considered the best choice as head of 
government at a time of political and economic crisis 
he was unanimously elected premier at a session of parliament on

an explosion in a mine in northern turkey 
started a fire and pumped dense smoke through the tunnels killing 
nine miners and trapping 58 nearly 1000 feet underground 
officials said today 
there was no chance for the survival of those trapped in the 
explosion wednesday night state minister mehmet yazar told 
reporters the fire and spreading smoke made rescue impossible 
all ventilation channels to the mine were closed to cut off air 
feeding the blaze he said union officials blamed the accident on 
lax enforcement of safety standards 
crews recovered eight bodies from the mine more than 900 feet 
underground and one of two rescued miners later died of severe 
burns said ekrem sami secretary general of madenis the 
mineworkers union 
it is also the end for all trapped down there which is an 
inferno sami said 
the tragedy began with a small fire at the yeniceltik coal mine 
in the township of merzifon 240 miles northeast of ankara near the 
black sea coast the fire set off an explosion of pit gas largely 
made of methane sami said the explosion in turn ignited a giant 
blaze 
tons of coal are burning there now there is little that can 
be done he said gas was smelled before the explosion but there 
was not enough time for the miners to escape he said 
sevket yilmaz president of turkis turkeys largest labor 
union confederation told reporters at the site this is no work 
accident this is murder because of neglect of safety standards 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported that this was 
the fourth accident in the history of the yeniceltik mine owned by 
the municipality of merzifon and the stateowned sugar company 
a similar explosion in 1965 killed 72 miners in 1983 an 
explosion in the northern province of zonguldak killed 102 miners 
the state sector and the private sector are equally guilty of 
negligence in all coal mines in turkey the conditions are 
primitive sami alleged 
the mine accident came a day after the labor ministry published 
a report deploring the inadequacy of safety standards in coal mines 
in northern turkey 
the report was prepared during the course of the investigation 
of 26 deaths and 7433 injuries in the pits last year 
the report criticized the mines for not having fireproof 
uniforms or artificial breathing apparatus

an american scientist known as the father of 
artificial intelligence and three geologists who developed the 
theory that the earths crust consists of rigid plates have won the 
1990 japan prizes the prize committee said today 
professor marvin lee minsky of the massachusetts institute of 
technology will receive one of the two prizes each worth 345000 
for developing and popularizing the concept of artificial 
intelligence or computers that reason like the human brain the 
science and technology foundation of japan said 
the other prize will be shared by professors william jason 
morgan of princeton university dan peter mckenzie of britains 
cambridge university and xavier le pichon of frances ecole normale 
superieure for their work on the theory of tectonic plates 
each year the prizes are awarded in two different areas of 
science and technology with this years awards given in the fields 
of earth science and the techology of integration 
according to plate tectonics the earths crust is made up of 
about 20 rigid plates that grind against each other with a velocity 
of several inches a year causing earthquakes volcanic eruptions 
and the formation of ridges and mountains 
the plate theory has been used widely to study earthquakes in 
japan said professor toshi asada of tokai university chairman

a top administration official got a rough 
reception today as he defended the white houses china policy 
before a house committee with one lawmaker saying it was lacking 
in credibility 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger described bushs 
efforts as the most likely route to longterm moderation of the 
beijing regime 
but the message wasnt selling well among either democrats or 
republicans 
i think there was a tone deafness toward the values and ideals 
this country stands for in the administrations contacts with 
china since last junes bloody crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators said rep henry hyde rill 
the president has isolated himself in congress and with the 
american people with a policy virtually lacking in credibility 
said rep sam gejdenson dconn 
the chairman of the panels asia subcommittee rep stephen 
solarz dny called eagleburgers december mission to beijing 
with national security adviser brent scowcroft one of the most 
misbegotten missions in contemporary american diplomacy 
eagleburger repeated testimony delivered a day earlier before 
the senate foreign relations committee in which he argued that 
hopes for change in china rest with reformers in the countrys 
leadership rather than the masses who demonstrated in and around 
tiananmen square 
if there are to be changes they will depend in large 
measure for some time to come on the attitudes and activities of 
people within the leadership who believe in reform eagleburger 
told the senate committee 
the process of reform in china so far has been largely led 
from the top eagleburger added asking for patience from 
lawmakers to give bushs efforts time to bear fruit 
the policy we are following is not one which will lead to a 
rapid payoff eagleburger told the senators this is a 
longhaul situation 
in repeated votes congress has rejected bushs policy toward 
china as insufficiently sensitive to human rights concerns high on 
the list of members objections are two clandestine trips 
eagleburger made to beijing last year with national security 
adviser brent scowcroft following the june 4 massacre of 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
many in congress believe the administration has been too cozy 
with the chinese government since the killings and that a 
confidential state department report that catalogs widespread human 
rights violations in china underscores their position 
referring to bushs closeness to chinese leaders as a former 
ambassador to beijing sen gordon humphrey rnh said i 
think the president has a lingering case of clientitis the 
affliction of diplomats who represent their host countrys views 
more strongly than those of their own country 
humphrey also said he hoped bush would not view the senates 
narrow vote to uphold his veto of a chinese students immigration 
bill last month as a vote of confidence in his policies 
committee chairman claiborne pell dri said bushs opponents 
have no desire to isolate china but added the choice with 
china is not between isolation and normal relations the choice is 
between good policy and bad policy 
sen joseph biden ddel asked whether the us action might 
signal to the soviet union that it could brutally repress a 
prodemocracy movement in one of the baltic states without 
incurring a severe us response 
i do not think that anyone should draw any conclusion that 
us policy toward china after tiananmen square applies to any 
other case eagleburger responded it is countryspecific 
answering charges that the administration has quickly dropped 
many of the limited trade sanctions it imposed following the 
tiananmen square crackdown eagleburger said the chinese 
certainly dont think its business as usual 
stronger sanctions he said would only strengthen those in the 
beijing government who would like nothing more than to go 
back behind their wall and live as they have so many times in the 
past 
steps the administration has taken such as allowing the 
shipment of usmade satellites for launch on chinese rockets and 
limited loans from multilateral banks have come in response to 
moderating moves in china he said

secretary of state james a baker iii met with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a schevardnadze for a second day 
today and the soviet official reported some movement in their 
negotiations over weapons arsenals 
shevardnadze also said the steps taken by the communist party 
central committee to abolish the partys monopoly on political 
power would improve ussoviet relations further 
it will mean we have more elements of trust in our 
relationship he said 
the official soviet news agency tass quoing about 400000 soviet and 
100000 
american soldiers under a treaty the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the warsaw pact are deliberating in vienna 
negotiations 
baker and shevardnadze seemed to be in an upbeat mood as they 
held a second round of talks at the soviet foreign ministry they 
were joined at a long negotiating table by more than a dozen aides 
bakers strategy meanwhile is to pursue his heavy agenda 
irrespective of internal soviet developments which he hailed in a 
statement wednesday night as contributing to reform and to 
political pluralism 
todays meeting with shevardnadze was expected to produce a 
soviet response to bushs troop reduction initiative 
overall our response is positive and we will discuss the 
details shevardnadze said he said bakers supplementary 
proposal on tanks and combat aircraft had some interesting 
elements 
on another issue german unification shevardnadze again 
referred to soviet concerns that are rooted in the loss of 20 
million people in world war ii 
he said they would be aired when west german chancellor helmut 
kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher come here saturday 
for talks 
shevardnadze has proposed an international referendum on the 
issue while baker has found merit in a formula advanced last week 
by genscher that would keep germany in nato but bar western forces 
from the area that is now east germany 
there are some elements there that deserve consideration 
shevardnadze said of genschers formula but referring to 
underlying soviet concerns shevardnadze added those issues will 
have to be addressed 
baker and the soviet foreign minister exchanged some preliminary 
thoughts on germany at their threehour meeting wednesday night 
overall shevardnadze said it was a good substantiative and 
very productive conversation on many questions 
baker confirmed he had presented some new ideas to reduce 
weapons and said he expected a reply from shevardnadze on bushs 
proposal for troop cuts initially bush proposed ceilings of 
275000 for the united states and the soviet union in europe 
prodded by more dramatic disarmament calls by soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev last year bush improved his own proposal of 
last june 
as baker arrived in moscow the central committee the soviet 
communist partys policymaking body was concluding a historic 
meeting at which it endorsed gorbachevs call for an end to the 
partys constitutional monopoly on power 
this is clearly a time of great change in the soviet union 
baker said in a statement they are making efforts to reform both 
their economic and political processes and they are emphasizing the 
importance of the introduction of pluralism into their political 
system 
bush meanwhile speaking to an audience in omaha nebraska on 
wednesday refrained from passing judgment on the moves by soviet 
communist leaders 
im not here to anoint or try to shape the deliberations of 
the central committee proceedings in the soviet union said bush 
but bush reiterated his admiration for gorbachev and his 
reforms saying he has handled some extraordinarily complicated 
internal problems with a certain restraint and finesse that i 
think demonstrates a real commitment to peaceful change 
baker planned a fourday stay in the soviet capital a meeting 
with gorbachev scheduled for friday is the anticipated climax of 
what was designed initially as a trip to prepare for the june 
summit but has now grown into a far more important ussoviet 
exchange

the judge in the assault trial of reputed mob 
boss john gotti scolded the jury after learning members of the 
panel were bickering 
acting justice edward mclaughlin cut short the jurys 
deliberations wednesday after a juror wrote a note complaining that 
one member of the panel had decided gottis guilt or innocence 
before the trial ever started 
gotti known as the dapper don because of his expensive 
doublebreasted suits is accused of ordering a union leader shot 
in 1986 he is reputed to be boss of the gambino mob family the 
nations most powerful criminal organization 
i wouldnt know whats going on in there but questioning 
somebodys lineage or intelligence is not the way to come to 
grips with the problem the judge said to the anonymous jury 
after they sent out a note wednesday evening 
jury service is a give and take as gently as possible its 
not a contest to see who can get in the most cutting triumphant 
gibe at the end 
the judge added jury duty is not only a sacrifice of time and 
money sometimes you have to sacrifice the opportunity to show how 
smart you are or how sharp you are 
defense attorneys immediately requested a mistrial because of 
the disagreements in the jury but mclaughlin denied the motion 
deliberations resumed this morning 
after the sequestered jury left the courtroom wednesday the 
judge read the note it said i feel we have a juror who has 
brought a previous bias into this room please advise this juror 
has indicated he had some opinion on guilt or innocence before the 
trial started 
the jury is deliberating assault and conspiracy charges against 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 61 they are accused of 
commissioning a gang to shoot john f oconnor former vice 
president of a carpenters union local in 1986 he was wounded in 
the buttocks 
prosecutors said gotti arranged the shooting because oconnor 
ordered thugs to trash a mobrun restaurant that was being built 
with nonunion labor 
gottis attorney bruce cutler didnt think the disagreements 
among the jury members were unusual 
its the nature of the system we think were in good shape 
cutler said 
guerrieris attorney gerald shargel said he found no fault in 
the judges action regarding the note 
if convicted gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a 
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974 
cutler and shargel contend gotti is being persecuted because of 
his reputation

a teenage girl died four days after 
becoming the worlds first recipient of an experimental lung 
device leaving behind a newborn son and a grieving hometown but 
hope that similar implants will save lives 
melicia mimi harvey 16 of arthur city texas who suffered 
from respiratory distress syndrome died wednesday of pulmonary 
failure said tim madden spokesman at lds hospital 
mimi had received an intravascular oxygenator or ivox in a 
twohour operation friday the device which works like a lung is 
a 20inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes as fine as human 
hair with walls so thin that oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass 
through 
there were no clinical complications from the use of the 
device madden said 
lds and three other medical centers have federal approval to 
implant the device in up to 10 patients and dr jd mortensen 
chief developer of the ivox for cardiopulmonics inc of salt lake 
city said the implants will continue 
it will take a long time to review the mountain of data we 
gathered with this case from what we know with this case it was 
extremely successful mortensen said 
nevertheless he said nine of the 10 patients who will receive 
the device are expected to die 
word of mimis death stunned classmates at frank stone high 
school in paris texas a month before mimi died she gave birth to 
a son trenell mimis mother edith harvey 41 died jan 31 of 
diabetesrelated causes 
many of the schools 735 students who included the girls 
sister and brother wept and eight ministers went to the school to 
counsel students 
its good that she left the baby behind because thats like 
shes leaving behind the best part of herself said one of mimis 
friends carolyn hawkins 
those closest to her said mimi added a spark to any place she 
went she was vice president of the student council and played 
flute in the band 
she had a great sense of humor and she had a contagious 
laugh said krissy hicks who was on the drill team with her 
she was always telling these weird jokes that nobody understood 
school officials authorized a fundraising mimi harvey day 
on friday to help pay burial expenses 
the girls identity and details of her condition had been kept 
private at her familys request until a texas newspaper identified 
her and her father atrell harvey ii an employee of the campbell 
soup co with the familys permission madden confirmed her 
identity wednesday 
the disease mimi suffered from has a variety of causes and is 
characterized by an inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen to 
the blood in its most severe forms it is fatal in 9095 percent of 
all cases madden said 
the ivox designed to give damaged lungs time to rest and 
recover is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena 
cava the large vein that brings blood to the heart 
two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the 
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body one delivers oxygen to 
the blood the other removes carbon dioxide 
the food and drug administration approved ivox in september for 
temporary implantation in up to 10 people at lds penn state 
universitys hershey medical center the university of michigan 
medical center in ann arbor and the los angeles countyuniversity 
of southern california medical center 
before mimi died it was unclear how long doctors intended to 
leave the device inside her madden had said any use beyond the 
seven days would require fda permission 
mortensen said further implants will involve only patients with 
acute lung diseases not chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis 
or emphysema 
were just waiting for the right case at any one of the 
centers he said

the sexual misconduct allegations against the 
founder of covenant house the nations biggest shelter for 
runaways has the organizations new chief worried that the 
children will be abandoned again 
frank macchiarola a former chancellor of city schools replaced 
the rev bruce ritter on wednesday saying he was sure allegations 
of sexual misconduct against the roman catholic priest were false 
but took their toll nevertheless 
were all sad macchiarola said this is not an easy time 
for us 
his chief task he said is to convince the public that the 
shelters mission must not be abandoned 
today fullpage advertisements for covenant house appeared in 
new york newsday and the daily news urging contributors to 
continue supporting its work the ad does not mention ritter or the 
controversy 
we need help theres no question about that there is a sense 
in the organization of loss of hurt of feeling that if this 
doesnt go right for them they will be abandoned once more 
macchiarola said 
basically our rules are sound but all of this is going to 
force us to be careful again and to look again at the things weve 
done 
macchiarola 48 took over for ritter because four past 
residents of covenant house have said ritter had sex with them when 
they were distressed teenagers the church is investigating at 
least some of the allegations 
in covenant house we of necessity must do things that are at 
risk macchiarola said a more conventional approach to that 
would mean that we would close the door covenant house goes out 
into the street on youngsters we dont wait for them to come 
to us 
ritter was told tuesday to step down as director of covenant 
house which has become the nations largest shelter program for 
runaway youngsters since he began it in 1968 with two abandoned 
tenements in new york city 
wabctv reported wednesday that a total of seven individuals had 
filed complaints with authorities the district attorneys office 
would not comment on the report 
ritter 62 has characterized as garbage accusations by four 
men that he carried on sexual relationships after they came to 
covenant house for help 
macchiarola said the covenant house board of which he is a 
member has never discussed the possibility that ritter would not 
return 
the new york post said wednesday that ritters fourth accuser 
paul johnson 33 came forward after it reported dec 12 on 
allegations against the priest by an exprostitute kevin kite 
kite whose allegations against ritter were the first to be made 
public accused him of giving money housing and gifts in exchange 
for sex 
franciscan church officials said they were investigating ritter 
and the district attorneys office was looking into covenant 
houses use of funds and its giving false identification to at 
least one youth 
macchiarola acknowledged that donations had decreased since the 
controversy began were not doing as well as we would have done 
had this not happened he said

police fired tear gas today to 
disperse about 2000 blacks who tried to protest an english cricket 
team touring the country in violation of an international sports 
boycott of south africa 
at least six people were arrested police said 
later riot police with batons broke up a second protest by 
about 100 black youths outside a downtown office building housing 
the british consulate the protesters were chased through the 
streets even though a british diplomat had asked police to let 
them stay 
the first confrontation occurred when police ordered 
demonstrators to disembark after they had boarded minibus taxis 
that were to take them from the black township of alexandra to the 
nearby wanderers stadium where the englishmen began a fiveday 
test match against south africas national team 
a judge had refused to grant a permit for a protest outside the 
stadium 
according to police the crowd dispersed peacefully after 
tear gas was used a local antiapartheid group the alexandra 
civic organization claimed some protesters were beaten and said 
the township was in chaos 
police said six activists from alexandra were arrested on 
suspicion of stealing vehicles to take protesters to the stadium 
police said eight journalists covering the confrontation were 
briefly detained at a local police station when they refused to 
obey an order to leave the area police claimed some journalists 
were providing transportation to protesters trying to get to the 
stadium 
moss mashishi a protest organizer claimed 30 people were 
injured he said police had set up roadblocks at exits from 
alexandra and were searching outgoing cars 
a few hours later about 100 black youths some carrying flags 
of the african national congress geurrilla movement gathered at a 
pedestrian mall outside the the british consulate riot police 
allowed the youths to remain for about an hour then declared the 
gathering illegal and chased some of the protesters along the mall 
and into the streets 
on wednesday a magistrate rejected an application by protest 
organizers to hold a demonstration at the stadium saying there was 
no appropriate space for a protest scores of protesters 
nonetheless reached the stadium today but were moved away by police 
after chanting slogans denouncing the english players 
capt eugene opperman a police spokesman said officers warned 
the blacks who had boarded the minibuses in alexandra that their 
protest would be illegal 
when they disembarked from the buses they started singing and 
dancing and refused to disperse until the tear gas was used 
opperman said 
at the wanderers stadium located in a wealthy residential area 
a newly formed organization called freedom in sport bought tickets 
for scores of blacks to watch the opening of the fiveday match 
the first international competition for south africas national 
team in three years 
ahmed mangera one of the leaders of the campaign against the 
tour said a group of black spectators knew nothing about cricket 
and were being paid to attend 
the members of the english team led by former england captain 
mike gatting expect to be barred from official international 
competition for five years for breaking the international cricket 
conferences ban on sporting contacts with south africa 
there have been unconfirmed press reports that the english 
players are receiving 160000 each for the tour with gatting 
getting 320000 
most international sports organizations boycott south africa 
because of its policy of apartheid under which the countrys 28 
million blacks have no vote in national affairs and are ruled by a 
government run by the 5 million whites

command system to give seoul more control over its armed forces 
officials said thursday

operational control of the top us commander in the country under 
a combined forces command system adopted in 1978

infringement upon the sovereignty of south korea radicals have 
attacked us facilities to protest the system 
south korean defense minister lee sanghoon meeting reporters 
thursday said the combined command system must be maintained in 
wartime he said the new arrangement under discussion may give 
south korea more power to control its military in peace time

the army which hurriedly awarded 186 
decorations to hospitalized soldiers two days after the panama 
invasion has taken back 14 combat infantryman badges from men 
found to be ineligible 
the badges were pinned to the pillows of men who were under 
sedation and couldnt be asked what they did in the operation said 
army spokesman maj joe padilla it turned out 14 were not in the 
infantry 
the threeinch badges which portray a silver rifle on a blue 
background emblazoned with a wreath are awarded only to soldiers 
with infantry specialties 
gen carl vuono the army chief of staff handed out the awards 
during a visit to two military hospitals in san antonio texas on 
dec 22 
the infantry badges have been the source of some controversy in 
recent weeks women who came under fire in panama are ineligible 
since they are barred from serving in infantry units but sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio has demanded that such women be granted 
the badges anyway 
as for the mistakenly awarded badges which were given quickly 
and without the usual review padilla said the problem did not stem 
from a quest for publicity this was not a photo op for gen 
vuono this was an honest mistake 
it was thought to be an opportunity for the men to be 
decorated by the chief of staff of the army it was an effort 
to distinguish those soldiers thought to be deserving and allow 
those who were wounded to wake up with the award on their pillow 
padilla said 
most of vuonos hospital visit was offlimits to reporters and 
only a small group was permitted to accompany the general to 
wilford hall medical center for the presentation of medals to three 
soldiers the general also visited nearby brooke army medical 
center 
the combat infantryman badge is granted only to officers or 
enlisted personnel with infantry specialties who have 
satisfactorily performed their duty in an infantry unit while 
engaged in combat padilla said 
the incorrectly awarded badges were given to men who were 
military policemen artillery soldiers communications specialists 
truck drivers or specialists in psychological operations the 
spokesman said 
the spokesman said he didnt think the soldiers would be 
disappointed every soldier knows what awards theyre eligible 
for they would know immediately that was a mistake he said 
the army declined to provide the names of the soldiers involved

prime minister ingvar carlsson said 
thursday the economy is falling apart and his government will 
resign unless parliament bans strikes and imposes a wageprice 
freeze for two years 
the plan that finance minister kjellolof feldt outlined in 
parliament also would put a twoyear freeze on local taxes rents 
and stock dividends 
some opposition legislators accused carlssons social democrats 
of declaring economic martial law and advocating a planned economy 
when eastern europe is abandoning that approach 
a vote is expected next week on the plan which is designed to 
curb rapidly rising wages and annual inflation of 86 percent 
twice the west european average 
carlssons minority government needs the support of at least one 
opposition party to pass each of its proposals both conservatives 
and liberals have indicated they would support a tax freeze and 
the communists said they would go along with freezing prices rents 
and stock earnings 
if parliament rejects our demands the government cannot stay 
on carlsson told a news conference we will not administer an 
economy that is falling apart 
his plan would suspend a 50yearold agreement under which 
powerful unions and employers associations negotiate wages 
quietly without government intervention 
collective bargaining is a pillar of the swedish welfare system 
which has eliminated poverty and guaranteed health care and 
education for everyone the swedish mix of socialism and capitalism 
became a model for the industrial welfare state 
what was known as the swedish model is on the whole gone 
and this is just another sign bank economist nils lundgren said 
on swedish radio 
strikes would be prohibited for the duration of the plan 
through 1991 and a striker could be fined 5000 kronor about 800 
to help curb absenteeism and cheating on sick leave the 
government would stop paying salaries for the first two weeks of 
illness shifting the burden to the employer under current rules 
the government pays sick leave from the first day 
what we propose is without doubt an austere policy feldt 
said it also means an important deviation from the swedish model 
of free wage negotiations but it is necessary 
carlsson said to make the wage freeze work it must be 
combined with a strike freeze if the riksdag parliament takes 
the package to pieces the package is meaningless 
approval of the plan would preempt a strike by 110000 municipal 
employees called for wednesday that would halt public 
transportation public health services and daycare in major cities 
banks have been closed for 11 days since 62000 employees were 
locked out after a deadlock in wage negotiations people are 
strapped for cash the stock market is virtually inoperative and 
some companies soon may be unable to pay salaries and bills 
if this merrygoround isnt stopped it could lead to anarchy 
on the labor market feldt said 
he compared the labor strife with britains winter of 
discontent in 1979 when strikes caused a conservative backlash 
that put prime minister margaret thatcher in power 
swedens largest union known as lo expressed guarded approval 
of the plan union president stig malm a member of the social 
democratic leadership said many members would be unhappy about the 
wage freeze but expressed hope the package as a whole would win 
great understanding 
sture nord of tco a whitecollar union declared in 
disagreement we cannot accept limits of trade unions rights 
carlsson told the news conference sweden was pricing itself out 
of the european market through rising production costs 
we had hoped the trade unions and employers organizations 
would agree on a lower cost development to increase competitive 
strength and reduce inflation he said they did not 
in parliament feldt said sweden is rushing into a cost 
crisis and that cannot be permitted

a federal judge refused today to give up 
jurisdiction in the drug trafficking case against manuel noriega 
rejecting defense efforts to have the fallen dictator moved to a 
neutral country 
i dont find that under the geneva convention i must divest 
myself of jurisdiction said us district judge william m 
hoeveler the trial judge 
william bryson us deputy solicitor general had argued the 
governments case that the judge does have jurisdiction 
yes we have agreed to treat general noriega as a prisoner of 
war bryson said but he said the geneva convention clearly 
authorizes noriegas prosecution in a us civilian court 
defense attorney frank rubino strongly dissented saying the 
government was trying to read the geneva convention to justify an 
illegal invasion and the detention of noriega 
your honor is going to decide whether we are going to strictly 
observe the geneva convention or whether we are going to push it 
aside a little bit so we can bring general noriega to trial 
rubino said 
rubino said he was not asking the judge to dismiss the 
indictment but to acknowledge he had no jurisdiction over noriega 
except to send him back to panama or a willing third country 
rubino said the united states could then try fair and square to 
get him back by extradition 
the comments came during a status conference on the indictment 
both sides agree the judge must also decide soon what procedures 
will be used to give the defendants classified documents they say 
are essential to the defense 
the hearing saw the first gathering in court of all six 
defendants brought here to face charges in the february 1988 drug 
trafficking case noriega brian alden davidow luis del cid luis 
saldarriaga daniel miranda and eduardo pardo 
an attorney for davidow 28 asked for a separate trial for his 
client in the motion defense attorney richard sharpstein said 
noriegas presence is similar to an atomic bomb producing 
fallout which would kill anyone tried with him 
hoeveler acknowledged that the march 5 trial date was 
unrealistic rubino he would need 18 months to two years to ready 
his case but prosecutors said they could start trial by the years 
end the judge did not set a new date 
on wednesday a us magistrate denied a request by noriegas 
attorneys for an immediate inventory and inspection of materials 
seized from the dictators homes and offices since the us 
invasion two months ago of panama 
defense attorneys already have gotten a promise of an inventory 
but they contend the government may remove or destroy materials 
critical to noriegas defense 
the us attorneys office is dragging its feet noriega 
attorney steven kollin told magistrate william c turnoff who last 
month issued an order that an inventory be provided to the defense 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
declined to comment on whether any potential evidence in the 
possession of the military had disappeared 
we do not believe anything has been removed from inventory in 
miami she said 
in a separate development wednesday the us drug enforcement 
adminstration announced that 34 computer diskettes captured during 
the us invasion of panama may show how noriega laundered drug 
money 
the dea has sought hoevelers approval of a search warrant 
permitting one of its agents to inspect the information on the 
diskettes according to todays miami herald 
the diskettes were reportedly discovered at the home in panama 
city of noriega business associate carlos wittgreen wittgreen was 
described in a dea affidavit made public wednesday as one of 
noriegas prime financial advisers

floridas former chief tax collector 
wrote a phony memo in an attempt to prove she didnt order a 
politically motivated audit investigators charged after examining 
her office typewriter ribbon 
katie tucker 46 was charged wednesday with official misconduct 
for falsifying documents punishable by five years in prison and a 
5000 fine she was released on her own recognizance 
the charge came one day after she resigned as state revenue 
director amid allegations she singled out a political opponent of 
her husbands for a tax audit in 1988 
ive done no wrongdoing she said i wish theyd just let 
me get on with my life 
her attorney lorence bielby said ms tucker would plead 
innocent to the misconduct charge no court date was set 
florida department of law enforcement agent john gordy said in 
court papers that ms tucker prepared a document purporting to show 
that she had asked an employee to conduct a broader tax 
investigation instead of singling out donald g resha 
resha unsuccessfully challenged tuckers husband daniel miller 
for president of the aflcio in 1985 
that memo was dated dec 21 1988 and addressed to a former 
revenue department employee who handled the resha investigation 
i am disappointed and concerned as to why you investigated one 
company only the memo said please do not ever again assume 
that i would want one company investigated when i have given you a 
much larger assignment 
gordy said the memo was probably produced by ms tucker on jan 
31 during a night visit to her office much of the evidence was 
found on a cartridge ribbon from a typewriter there the fdle said 
ms tucker has insisted while trying to save her 85292ayear 
job that she intended to order a larger tax probe of video stores 
like those owned by resha and claimed she could find documents to 
back her up but she never showed those documents publicly

fort bragg enlisted a psychologist to 
help soldiers deal with their feelings about combat in panama in 
the armys first attempt to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder 
before it appears 
we called it shell shock in world war ii lt col dick 
bridges an army spokesman at the pentagon said wednesday in a 
telephone interview but weve come to understand it better and 
have only called it posttraumatic stress since 1980 
bridges said he wasnt sure if the army provided counseling for 
the disorder after the invasion of grenada in october 1983 but 
it seems to me that this is the first time that weve tried to be 
proactive in trying to treat it before it happens 
unlike vietnam veterans soldiers returning from panama were 
greeted by cheers and commendations and psychologists say that 
could make them less likely to suffer the effects of posttraumatic 
stress disorder 
last week bragg invited some psychologists to work with 
soldiers and their family members who were involved with the panama 
incursion dubbed operation just cause said maj doug foster base 
spokesman the medical community at womack army community hospital 
worked with the psychologists to learn to recognize early symptoms 
of the syndrome he said 
dr tom williams a consultant for the post trauma treatment 
center at centennial peaks hospital in louisville colo spent 
five days at fort bragg on a volunteer basis and spoke to about 
2000 soldiers and family members 
williams said he drew on his own experiences as a marine captain 
during two tours in vietnam to help soldiers at fort bragg cope 
with their feelings after their brief combat experience 
im jealous because these guys went in as a unit and came out 
as a unit said williams 38 i didnt have that luxury in 
vietnam nobody cared about us afterwards either in the defense 
department or the civilian community 
the brief duration of the fighting in panama which ended in the 
first week after the initial assault does not prevent the 
possibility of emotional ill effects he said 
what we would not want to see is what happened after vietnam 
high states of depression high suicide rates high alcoholism 
rates and high divorce rates williams said 
if we were talking about an airplane crash and people who 
pulled bodies out and risked their lives in recovering survivors 
there would be no question there would be emotional response to 
that williams said combatants have the same type of response 
because theyre human beings 
the effects of traumatic events go beyond the mind williams 
said 
were talking about the endocrine system bursts of adrenalin 
which our body has for our survival he said when adrenalin 
gets used up then you have another chemical which slows down all 
the body processes particularly the nervous system thus the 
listlessness 
no one seems able to escape the effects of going into battle 
not even the soldiers left behind 
the people who stayed in the rear have to realize what they 
did was important williams said 
understanding can ease the way for soldiers who may experience 
trauma from the ordeal 
family members must realize that experiencing combat either 
firsthand or indirectly inevitably alters the life of their loved 
one williams said a soldiers homecoming is easier if 
families understand the typical emotional responses one has 
experienced

rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on 
thursday in srinagar the flashpoint of a violent separatist 
campaign officials said 
witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack 
which occurred outside the vendors kiosk in the chanpora suburb of 
the city a bystander was injured said the witnesses who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since jan 
20 in clashes between security forces and moslem militants fighting 
for secession of the moslemdominated kashmir region from 
hindumajority india 
most victims have been protesters shot while defying a curfew 
imposed jan 20 when government forces launched a crackdown 
a senior police official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said militants exploded bombs in a government building and a 
governmentrun bank in srinagars outskirts thursday causing 
severe damage there were no casualties 
the official also blamed militants for a fire that broke out in 
a downtown shopping center no casualties were reported in the 
blaze 
security was strengthened across srinagar after the incidents 
new roadblocks were set up and more paramilitary troops were 
deployed on the streets the official said 
some soldiers patrolled in trucks while others perched with 
machine guns on the sides of roads a curfew that was to have begun 
at 6 pm instead took effect in the afternoon in three areas of 
the city after the shootings 
the two paramilitary border security force officers were shot 
with chinesedesigned ak47 rifles from close range as they walked 
from their camp toward the cigarette kiosk 100 yards from the 
camps gate said ashok patel inspectorgeneral of the border 
security force he said the men were unarmed and were not in 
uniform when attacked 
it was the first reported slaying by moslem militants of 
paramilitary troops 
the border security force known to be a more disciplined and 
tougher force that the state constabulary is normally deployed on 
international borders but has been increasingly used to put down 
the kashmir secessionist movement 
state police began preparations to counter violence friday the 
moslem sabbath on past sabbath days speeches have been broadcast 
from mosques urging people to fight for kashmirs independence 
gov jagmohan known to be a tough administrator who ordered the 
jan 20 crackdown on thursday appealed for peace in kashmir the 
himalayan valley once popular for its gardens lakes and apple 
orchards 
let us impress once again on our young brothers to see the 
futility of the cult of guns and understand the magnitude of 
allround misery that it has caused he said in a letter released 
by the state government 
jagmohan a hindu who uses only one name wrote the letter to 
the father of a moslem youth who was killed in a bomb explosion in 
a shopping complex on wednesday 
kashmir was divided between india and pakistan after the two 
countries were partitioned on gaining independence from britain in 
1947 srinagar and the surrounding areas of the valley became part 
of jammukashmir state indias only predominantly moslem state 
sixtyfour percent of the states 5 million people are moslems 
but nationwide moslems make up 12 percent of indias population of 
880 million 
kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with 
pakistan which claims kashmir because of its predominant moslem 
population but now they demand independence and the status of a 
neutral country

the united states is deeply concerned about 
the possibility of a terrorist attack against americans or us 
installations in europe to coincide with the upcoming 11th 
anniversary of the islamic revolution in iran the state department 
said today 
deputy spokesman richard boucher recalled that a threat advisory 
was issued last december and he said that threat continues the 
anniversary of irans revolution is this sunday 
boucher added that the united states has no specific information 
about the alleged terrorist operation or its target 
if further credible or specific information on this threat 
develops the department will issue additional alerts to travelers 
and other concerned parties he said 
he added that the department is encouraging travelers to europe 
to exercise caution but that americans are not being urged to 
cancel plans they may have to visit the continent 
the statement issued last december said the concern was based 
partly on reports of movement of terrorists from the middle east 
and the discovery of weapons shipments destined for proiranian 
groups in spain and africa 
at the time officials said there were several anniversaries 
pending that terrorists sometimes use as occasions for carrying out 
violent activities 
one was the still unresolved bombing of pan am flight 103 on 
dec 21 1988 over lockerbie scotland with a death toll of 259 
aboard the craft and 11 on the ground

the little bird pictured on south 
carolinas new license plates is ruffling the feathers of experts 
who say its not a carolina wren as the plates makers claim 
the rendition looks more like a sparrow than a wren said 
john cely a biologist at the south carolina department of wildlife 
and marine resources 
cely said carolina wrens generally are brown have long 
needlelike bills and tend to cock their tails at 90 degrees 
the bird on the license plate has a short bill and straight tail 
bob wood president of the columbia audubon society said he is 
particularly offended by the gross shade of yellow selected for 
the bird 
the carolina wren is a beautiful chocolatecolored bird 
which im sure would have made for a pretty license he said 
im just so disappointed that the highway department depicted 
such a beautiful bird as something thats not even close 
william h kay of the state highway departments administrative 
services division said he discussed the drawing with the artist 
glynn keisler after it was completed 
im not sure whether she contacted the audubon society and i 
dont know what her basis was for this he said but we did 
discuss how the tail should be shown whether it should be turned 
up or not but she said it only was turned up when the bird was in 
an excitable state 
kay said people should not get upset over the birds color 
when was the last time you saw a blue or red palmetto tree 
he asked referring to two previous versions of the states license 
plate 
ive only received a few negative comments about the plate 
and those have been generally about the birds tail and color 
kay said aside from those most people seem to think its the 
most beautiful license plate theyve seen 
there was no comment from ms keisler she resigned from the 
highway department about a year ago after she finished the drawing 
and is no longer listed in the columbia telephone book 
kay said ms keislers drawing was not the only one considered 
we also considered a drawing of a golfer he said but not 
everyone golfs so we went with this

congress chief economist said thursday that a 
proposed reduction in social security taxes could worsen inflation 
while doing nothing to ease the longrange problems of the pension 
system 
because the economy is operating close to its full capacity 
now a significant reduction in payroll tax rates without 
offsetting deficit reductions elsewhere could harm the economys 
performance over the next several years robert d reischauer 
director of the congressional budget office told the senate 
finance committee 
no matter what happens to the tax cut proposed by sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny reischauer said retirement benefits for 
future generations will have to be financed out of the goods and 
services being produced at that time 
a permanent increase in taxes or reductions in other federal 
programs appears to be a certainty since the retirement of the 
postworld war ii baby boom will mark the beginning of a 
permanent increase in the ratio of retirees to workers he said 
richard g darman director of the white house office of 
management and budget also argued against a social security tax 
reduction darman said moynihans bill if it became law would 
either worsen next years deficit by 55 billion or result in an 
offsetting tax increase 
raising other taxes would hurt the very workers senator 
moynihans proposal is ostensibly intended to help darman said 
indeed it would hurt them doubly first by jeopardizing their 
future retirement benefits and second by taking back in new taxes 
what it pretended to give in the way of a tax cut 
darman said the bush administration agrees with moynihan that 
the government should stop using surplus social security taxes to 
make the regular federal deficit appear smaller than it is but the 
answer he said is the administrations proposal which starting 
gradually in 1993 would require that surplus social security taxes 
be used only to pay off federal debt 
moynihans bill apparently has picked up little support among 
colleagues on the taxwriting finance committee no member offered 
an endorsement the chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said he 
is opposed 
bentsen told reporters that moynihan one of social securitys 
most ardent defenders in congresss deserves praise for tearing 
the mask off of this idea that were financing the deficit with a 
surplus in the social security trust fund 
but insofar as bringing about that kind of cut in revenues 
theres no way we can afford to do that at the present time 
bentsen said the cut proposed by moynihan would be about 60 
billion a year when fully implemented yielding tax cuts that would 
be nearly 300 a year for higherincome workers 
the democratic leadership of the senate and house are expected 
to take a position on moynihans bill within several days 
the government is collecting about 1 billion a week more in 
social security taxes than it is paying in benefits by law that 
money is invested in federal securities the surplus makes the 
deficit in the overall government budget look much smaller than it 
really is 
the social security system is deliberately building a surplus in 
an effort to guarantee that ample money will be on hand to pay 
benefits when the big postworld war ii generation begins retiring 
around 2010 whether or not social security taxes are cut now 
experts say they will have to be raised again early in the next 
century 
a worker now pays a 765 percent social security tax on the 
first 51300 earned each year the employer matches the payment 
moynihans bill would repeal a rate increase that went into effect 
jan 1 restoring the rate to 751 percent and cut it next year to 
655 percent

the federal communications commission on 
thursday ordered a record 14 million fine against new york 
telephone co and new england telephone and telegraph co for 
alleged improper dealings with an affiliated company and ordered 
them to refund about 35 million to customers 
the fine against the two subsidiaries of nynex corp was the 
maximum allowed under current law and involved alleged 1185 
million in overcharges made to nyt and net by material enterprises 
co an unregulated nynex affiliate nynex established in 1983 to 
provide equipment and services to the two phone companies 
the action the largest federal penalty ever imposed on a 
telephone company was seen as a tough warning to the nations 
huge regional bell companies that the fcc is committed to 
regulating the multibilliontelephone industry 
critics claim the fcc cannot effectively regulate the giant hone 
companies particularly if congress bows to the phone companies 
requests that they be freed from federal rules that bar them from 
the manufacturing information services and longdistance 
businesses 
fcc chairman alfred sikes told reporters the fccs action 
demonstrates the commissions capability and commitment to 
regulate even the largest telephone companies 
sikes said the benefits to be derived from improved competition 
and diversification in the phone industry following the 1984 
breakup of the bell system must be accompanied by strong 
ratepayer and competitive safeguards todays action demonstrates 
that such safeguards actually exist and that they are being 
efficiently administered and vigorously enforced 
nynex has 30 days to answer the fccs order and company 
officials said they would state their case strongly 
nyt and net each were fined 709500 nynex has revenues of 
about 12 billion annually 
richard firestone the fccs chief telephone regulator defended 
the size of the fine as the maximum penalty available under the 
rules 
he said the companies were being penalized because we dont 
believe this was an inadvertent error in bookkeeping 
nynex chairman william ferguson said the company welcomed the 
fcc audit so that nynexs arguments finally will be heard in a case 
that first was disclosed by the boston globe 
but ferguson said the fcc was incorrectly subjecting nynex to 
rules that were established in 1977 for atampt and its affiliate the 
western electric co 
ferguson also maintained that nynex had scrupulously followed 
1987 fcc bookkeeping safeguards designed to prevent costshifting 
to nonregulated affiliates and that nynex had agreed with new york 
state regulators to turn over ownership of meco to the two phone 
companies 
my overriding concern is our customers and the good faith of 
our customers because certainly there has been no intention to 
overcharge ferguson said 
new york state regulators and new york telephone officials 
recently reached a settlement under which nyt would reduce a 900 
million rate hike request to a 367 million cut this year and an 
increase of 445 million in 1991 with another 20 million to be 
used to make up for any overcharges by meco 
as part of the agreement state officials would end their 
investigation of nynex and meco 
a new york judge on tuesday rejected the settlement as being 
inadequate 
thursdays fcc order was based on the findings of a routine 
audit initiated during 1988 firestone said audit would have taken 
place despite the the boston globe reports but that the news 
stories did cause fcc auditors to shift their attack 
the bureau audit focused on compliance with the affiliate 
transaction rules and policies which are designed to protect 
ratepayers and competition from harmful crosssubsidies the fcc 
said 
the rules provide that when a regulated telephone company such 
as nyt or net purchases supplies or services from an affiliated 
company the telephone company may recover from ratepayers no more 
than the cost that would have been incurred in an arms length 
transaction 
the fcc said the three companies engaged in a series of 
transactions between 1984 and 1988 designed to increase the overall 
profits of their parent company nynex corp at ratepayer expense 
the fcc said its audit revealed that nyt and net purchased 
equipment supplies and services from meco at prices that were 
inflated by 1185 million approximately 35 million of these 
inflated costs were passed along to interstate ratepayers the fcc 
said 
firestone said about 97 percent of mecos business was with 
nynex 
thursdays action will not affect local telephone rates for nyt 
and net customers any refunds would have to be made through a 
reduction in the fees longdistance carriers such as atampt pay to 
connect with the local telephone company networks 
when the longdistance companies pay lower access fees they 
must pass those savings along to customers

muscovites on thursday hailed the communist 
partys decision to end its political monopoly but many wondered 
whether the party will truly allow a multiparty democracy and 
abandon seven decades of repressive rule 
everything will depend on whether people are ready to exert 
pressure said vladimir a tikhonov a member of the congress of 
peoples deputies the congress which is the national parliament 
will pass final judgment on the proposal to remove the 
constitutional article giving the communists an exclusive claim to 
power 
many people who crowded onto pushkin square the soviet version 
of speakers corner in london predicted a battle for power and 
threw their support behind fledgling opposition groups 
as they have daily dozens huddled in front of the offices of 
moscow news one of the most progressive soviet newspapers to talk 
politics but on thursday their chats were enlivened by the 
threeday meeting of the communist party central committee which 
ended wednesday by recommending creation of a westernstyle 
presidency and popular elections of communist leaders 
the party daily pravda splashed news of the central committee 
meeting on its front page thursday as it had done the three 
preceding days but did not publish the most crucial document the 
platform outlining steps toward democracy the newspaper carried 
five pages of speeches at the meeting 
many people interviewed said they fear the congress of peoples 
deputies will reject the partys recommendations because the 
congress is dominated by hardliners 
peddlers on pushkin square the home of the first mcdonalds in 
the soviet union and a hotspot for political demonstrations sold 
newspapers published by fledgling political groups such as the 
peoples front of the baltic republic of latvia part of the 
movement for democracy that could get a boost from the central 
committee decision 
one salesman sold a newspaper with two images sidebyside of 
president mikhail s gorbachev one showing him in a trilby hat and 
the other an american baseball cap 
people crowded threedeep to read papers tacked onto the gray 
stone walls of the moscow news building one was a 35page document 
titled the mafia and perestroika and another was a transcript 
of a speech by populist legislator boris n yeltsin 
one woman ludmilla frolova wore a yeltsin button with a 
picture of the maverick communist and the slogan the mind 
conscience of the people 
the crowds wondered whether anything would really change in a 
country that has fallen behind the tide of democracy sweeping 
eastern europe 
the party started out as the initiator of perestroika but has 
become a braking force one man said 
another man said the people have matured but the first 
chimed in the people havent matured yet if they had it would 
be like romania or east germany 
others said they were pinning their hopes for change on 
democratic platform a group of communists fighting for radical 
changes in the party and government they predicted the communist 
party would become just one of many competing for power and the 
peoples support but they worried the party could dash opponents 
efforts through its control of paper distribution and other tools 
of democracy 
a 63yearold woman who lived through the repressions of 
dictator josef stalin and stagnation of leonid i brezhnev said she 
was ready to fight for democracy 
we should boycott the elections or cross out all the names on 
the ballots because theyre all apparatchiks said the woman 
her silver teeth shining in the afternoon sun 
russians go to the polls march 4 to elect members of local 
governing councils and many have expressed concern the party is 
not allowing progressives to run 
this year will be a real battle one man predicted 
a woman said a huge rally and march by progressive groups in 
moscow last sunday was only the beginning of the battle 
on the fourth we almost took the kremlin on the 25th we will 
take the kremlin she said 
nationwide prodemocracy protests are planned feb 25

president bush saluted his childhood 
hometown on its 350th birthday saying it gave him a strong 
foundation and values as sturdy as the trees that grow there 
i am pleased to send my warmest greetings and congratulations 
to the people of greenwich as you celebrate the 350th anniversary 
of the founding of this beautiful town bush wrote in a letter to 
greenwich first selectman john margenot 
bush spent his childhood in the posh new york city suburb of 
60000 and his mother dorothy bush still lives here 
the first real appreciation my brothers sister and i felt 
for this lovely historic town came from the abundance of great old 
trees that we somehow knew were there just for us to climb the 
president wrote in greenwich we gained a strong foundation and 
values that were as sturdy and true as those great sheltering trees 
values that have served and guided us throughout our lives 
margenot said the letter will probably be framed and displayed 
at town hall but the final details have not been arranged 
according to bushs letter the town was founded in july 1640 
when a group of settlers purchased some land from the indians it 
was the 10th town to be established in what is now connecticut

the homebuilding industry may be approaching 
a recession because of rising interest rates a sluggish economy 
and the dampening effects on loans from the savings and loan 
bailout law the president of the national association of home 
builders said thursday 
what looked like a flat year a month ago has taken a turn for 
the worse martin perlman said at a news conference were 
skating on very thin ice we may be getting terribly close to a 
housing recession 
perlman a houston builder noted that mortgage interest rates 
returned to doubledigit levels last month after dropping into the 
single digits in the last half of 1989 and spurring a brief rebound 
in housing starts 
because of the weakness in last years construction home 
builders chief economist david seiders has changed the 
organizations forecast for housing starts from 144 million in 
1990 to 138 million 
but perlman said thursday that the rise in rates combined with 
continued economic slugishness declining consumer confidence and 
the difficulty in getting building loans may force the home 
builders to lower that projection even further 
perlman urged congress on wednesday to change that part of the 
thrift bailout law that reduces the amount a savings and loan can 
lend to one borrower from 100 percent to 15 percent 
that section and a second provision requiring thrifts to hold 
more of their capital in reserve have choked off funds from many 
builders he said 
perlman said builders at the organizations convention in 
atlanta last month told in a survey of curtailing construction 
projects after getting word that their sampls were reducing the 
amount of money it could lend them 
for every 100000 drop in housing starts there is a loss of 
176000 jobs 46 billion in wages 155 billion in federal 
state and local income taxes and 160 million in local property 
taxes he said about the ripple effect 
that ripple effect also extends to other industries related to 
housing such as home furnishings he said

ramshackle squatters huts stopped at a daycare center visited 
the home of african national congress leader walter sisulu and 
spoke at a meeting of township teachers 
at the orlando home and creche a daycare center for soweto 
children jackson took preschool children on his knee and posed for 
pictures under a banner reading welcome baba jesse jackson 
we love you very very much 
baba or father is a term of respect 
earlier echoing speeches he made on the campaign trail during 
the 1988 presidential race jackson roared to youths gathered 
outside sisulus home keep your head high keep hope alive 
sisulu had jackson for tea at the whitewashed stucco house he 
returned to in october after 25 years in prison an anc flag 
fluttered on a swaying staff over the house outside a crowd of 
100 people sang and chanted 
jackson emerging arm in arm with sisulu cheerfully joined in 
the dancing then stood quietly as sisulu led the singing of god 
bless africa the hymn black nationalists hope will one day 
become south africas national anthem 
youve inspired hope around the world jackson declared 
its so good to see you express your will to be free and to see 
you determined to put hope in your heart and hope in your brains 
and not dope in your veins 
jackson began his visit to soweto home to 25 million blacks 
at the funda cultural center on its outskirts after greeting local 
dignitaries jackson sisulu and the rev frank chikane general 
secretary of the south african council of churches attended a 
meeting of 2000 township teachers

cartoon portraying jackson as a song and dance man in front of a 
cell containing mandela with a director saying in the caption 
thank you but we dont need any extras in this scene 
other newspapers carried matteroffact stories on inside pages 
on his arrival except the sowetan which carried his picture and 
story on its front page 
walking along the muddy rows between intermittent rain showers 
jackson was asked if soweto had changed since 1979 when he last 
visited 
there are a lot more people and there are some new houses 
jackson replied but no one in soweto yet has the right to vote 
no one yet is empowered to help determine fairly the resources of 
the country 
even when nelson mandela leaves jail he will not be free 
he will not be able to live in the community of his choice he will 
not be able to send his grandchildren to the school of their 
choice jackson said of the anc leader who is expected to be 
freed soon from his life prison term 
mandela has said he will return to the small house he has rented 
in soweto for 40 years when he is released

salvage 
police said they stopped hileman orginally from the ford city 
area because he was driving in the wrong direction on a oneway 
street in the town about 45 miles from pittsburgh 
hileman had seven bombs in his car several handguns a sword 
two knives and a slingshot said police chief jan lysakowski 
hileman was charged sunday with carrying prohibited offensive 
weapons and firearms without a license driving under the influence 
of alcohol and possession of a controlled substance lysakowski 
said he was being held in lieu of 100000 bail 
fbi agent jeff kimball in pittsburgh said the devices went sent 
to a lab at fbi headquarters to be examined to see if there is any 
connection with other cases under investigation 
those cases kimball said include the december mail bombings 
that killed us circuit judge robert vance in birmingham ala 
and city councilman robert robinson in savannah ga 
i dont know for sure whether they will compare the evidence 
against those cases he said its a logical assumption 
however lysakowski said he has no evidence linking hileman with 
the december mail bombings we dont believe there is a link 
he said we have nothing to indicate that 
the bombs in hilemans possession 3inch cylinders full of 
black powder with fuses attached were not the same type used in 
the southeast bombings the police chief said 
in lowndes county ga sheriff g robert carter said hileman 
has no criminal record in that area 
ed hileman of valdosta deans brother told the valdosta daily 
times the explosives and some of the other items were used in the 
salvage business and added youve just got to know dean 
he said his brother uses the explosives to loosen beaver dams 
and tree stumps and to knock things loose so he can do his job 
he said some of the weapons were used for protection while others 
were collectors items

the state thursday dropped its effort to 
force an 84yearold woman to have a gangrenous foot amputated but 
the womans family pleaded with a judge to order her to have the 
lifesaving operation 
israeli liberals hailed thursdays outcome as a victory in the 
righttodie issue because the court refrained from imposing 
unwanted medical treatment on ruth trabelsi 
offspring of mrs trabelsi argued bitterly over what to do next 
and rabbi mordechai eliahu spirititual leader of jews of middle 
eastern and north african origin said he would try to change her 
mind 
from the standpoint of jewish law she should accept the 
treatment to save her life eliahu said 
doctors at poriah hospital in the northern galilee town of 
tiberias want mrs trabelsis right leg amputed above the knee to 
avoid the spread of gangrene which set in as a complication from 
hardening of the arteries and blood clottings 
mrs trabelsi has refused to have the operation saying she 
wants to enter the garden of eden with both feet 
the israeli welfare ministry took the case to court wednesday 
under a 1966 law ordering the protection of citizens who may not be 
responsible for themselves 
it withdrew its appeal thursday after geriatric specialist leon 
spalter testified during a hearing that mrs travelsi was lucid 
and fully capable of making an organized decision 
if you have withdrawn the request then i have no reason to 
interfere judge oded gershon said 
this touched off a tearful courtroom argument among some of mrs 
trabelsis 258 children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren who 
are divided over whether she should be forced to have the surgery 
shalom trabelsi the womans youngest son wept and tried to 
persuade the judge to force the operation please the rabbis 
have already said she must have the operation we are only waiting 
for you to say so please do it he said 
another son eliahu trabelsi disagreed our tradition says 
ask your elders we have to respect what our elders say 
haim cohen a retired supreme court justice and former civil 
rights activist praised the outcome on israel radio saying it 
upheld past rulings that you do not conduct a medical operation 
without a patients consent 
relatives pursued their argument in a shouting match at the 
hospital after the court session israel radio reported 
we have never had such a problem before poriahs chief 
surgeon dr amos mazor said on the radio he said he would seek 
advice from the health ministrys legal department about what to do 
next 
hospital director yaacov farbstein said in a telephone interview 
that without mrs trabelsis consent her leg would be left alone 
we cannot force her to the operating room we will just try to 
treat her as best we can 
farbstein added that without the amputation mrs trabelsi was 
likely to die of spreading infection from the gangrene but he 
would not estimate how long she had to live 
farbstein suggested that the delay in amputation has already 
complicated her condition on wednesday doctors were recommending 
that only her foot be amputated but they said thursday that 
removal of the leg to above the knee was required

the united states is concerned about the 
possibility of a terrorist attack against americans or us 
facilities somewhere in europe this weekend by proiranian 
militants the state department said thursday 
but deputy spokesman richard boucher had no specific information 
about the alleged threat and said the us government was not 
urging americans to cancel travel plans to europe instead 
travelers are encouraged to be alert to any danger he said 
other officials said threat advisory messages have been sent in 
recent days to us diplomatic posts in europe and the middle east 
boucher said the us concern is linked to the 11th anniversary 
of the islamic revolution in iran this sunday 
officials have said that iran has established a farflung 
terrorist network targeted at american and west european interests 
especially civil aviation but officials said thursday that they 
had no details on what type of us facility might be a terrorist 
target this weekend 
the spokesman recalled that a threat advisory was issued in 
december and said that threat continues the statement issued two 
months ago warned of the possibility of an attack against an 
american or western european target but thursdays announcement 
spoke only of us interests being possible targets 
the december statement said the concern in december was based 
partly on reports of movement of terrorists from the middle east 
and on the discovery of weapons shipments destined for proiranian 
groups in spain and africa

rather than calming fears of economic 
collapse in east germany chancellor helmut kohls advocacy of one 
currency for east and west germany has created worries about 
continued prosperity at home 
economists and investors have reacted negatively to kohls 
proposal for swift introduction of the west german mark in east 
germany whose own mark is not convertible some accuse him of 
trying to boost his chances in the december elections 
fear that taking over the easts nearly bankrupt system would 
endanger the west german economy drove bond prices down thursday 
for the third straight day the mark has dropped two pfennigs 
against the weak us dollar in two days 
kohl said wednesday a cabinet committee was drafting plans for 
union with east germany including a common currency 
by making the strong deutschmark the official currency of east 
germany in return for freemarket reforms the worries go bonn 
would in effect be taking on the economic woes of its eastern 
brothers and distributing them among prosperous west germans 
through higher taxes 
more marks would have to be printed adding to the money supply 
and forcing interest rates up higher rates would slow the west 
german investment boom that is supposed to bankroll the eastern 
bailout 
experts see monetary union as a necessary step toward east 
germanys economic recovery and eventual integration with west 
germany in a single state 
central bank president karl otto poehl and others however feel 
transition to a convertible currency for east germany must be 
gradual a companion of economic reform rather than its catalyst 
providing east germans with a currency of value before they have 
anything at home to buy might even make the economic imbalance 
between the two countries worse economists contend 
without that economy being given a chance to acquire a more 
efficient status currency union would just mean having bad money 
drag down good money liane launhardt a senior economist with 
commerzbank in frankfurt told the associated press 
she accused kohl of irresponsible electioneering in 
proposing swift conversion of saying what he thinks the people 
want to hear 
east germanys economic disaster has become a west german 
problem even without monetary union because huge numbers of east 
german emigres strain social services job markets and the publics 
patience 
finance minister theo waigel acknowledged that speedier efforts 
toward monetary union were intended to give east germans confidence 
in their future 
this is a signal an appeal he told reporters the people 
of east germany must know we are ready to take a decisive step 
toward the unity of germany 
a source in kohls christian democratic union said the 
chancellor was trying to avoid further political damage from the 
influx of east germans about 340000 moved west last year and the 
pace this year hovers around 2000 a day accelerating the economic 
decline in their homeland 
industrial output in east germany and the availability of even 
basic goods have plummeted in recent weeks 
waigel would not predict when the deutschmark would replace the 
east german currency or what such a major step toward 
reunification would cost west grmany 
helmut geiger president of the savings banks association said 
monetary union would cost a sizable doubledigit billionmark 
sum ten billion marks equals more than 6 billion 
government sources indicated privately that kohls 
administration recognizes the probable hardships for west germans 
of the transition period 
sudden application of capitalist economics to east germany would 
compel the closing of inefficient factories resulting in 
widespread layoffs 
an internal finance ministry paper shown to reporters predicts 
14 million jobless in a few months or more than 15 percent of the 
working population 
west germany would have to provide unemployment benefits to 
carry those affected through retraining and job placement probably 
forcing higher taxes in a nation with 85 percent unemployment of 
its own 
economists at west germanys leading financial institutes say 
conversion to a market economy must be well under way for such a 
plan as kohls to work 
if you export a hard currency to a country that doesnt have a 
strong economy then it will no longer be a hard currency said 
heiner flassbeck an economist with the german institute for 
economic research in berlin 
the financial impact on west germany will depend primarily on 
the conversion rate fixed for the deutschmark and the east german 
currency which the berlin institute believes should be at least 1 
to 3 
if west germany takes over east germany at a bad price then 
the market value of the federal republic drops as well said 
reinhard pohl an economist with the institute 
premature introduction of the deutschmark would encourage more 
spending by east germans outside their country which would make 
the economic decline worse and might force a hasty takeover by west 
germany 
in a report issued wednesday the institute said considerable 
illusions among people in both germanys cloud prospects for 
successful monetary union

the united states still leads the world in 
science and technology but no longer dominates as it once did 
according to a national science foundation report released thursday 
a national weakness has developed in science and engineering 
education in production of hightech goods and in research and 
development funding the report said 
mary l good chairwoman of the national science board a 
foundation group that produced the report said cooperative action 
between government industry and academia is required if the united 
states is to maintain its leadership position 
the report said 
growth rates have slowed in both research and development and 
in the training of scientists and engineers 
science and mathematics education in us schools has shown 
little improvement despite major reform efforts 
fewer college and university freshmen are choosing science and 
mathematics fields which means there will be fewer degrees in 
technical fields in the coming years 
the number of foreign students earning advanced degrees in us 
schools continues to increase while the number of advanced degrees 
to americans continues to decline 
the us growth in research and development was 6 percent 
annually from 1975 to 1985 but slowed to 2 percent annually from 
1986 to 1989 
the united states spends more on research and development than 
the united kingdom japan france and west germany combined but 
japan and west germany spend a greater portion of their gross 
national product on research and development than the united states 
while the us continues to be the worlds foremost supplier 
of hightech products its lead is shrinking the report said

thursday and ordered to undergo treatment for severe mental 
illness 
us magistrate deborah robinson ordered michael breen 31 of 
washington to remain in an inpatient psychiatric hospital until 
he can prove in court that he does not pose a risk to others 
in october breen encountered the ohio senator at an outdoor 
television interview lunged at him from the side and landed a 
solid right to the jaw aside from redness and a few days of 
soreness glenn a 68yearold exmarine was unharmed

management agency a week earlier assistant us attorney craig 
iscoe told the court 
breen was responding to instructions he received in dreams the 
attorney said 
at inglimas request the judge sealed the records containing 
breens psychiatric report an action that moved breens mother to 
tears 
breen had been an engineer with martin marietta corp and showed 
no signs of mental problems until the dreams began in december 
1988 according to the court record

a corporate lawyer who lost his cool when a 
conducter screen his railroad pass has led to an investigation that 
nabbed 12 people including highsalaried executives with 
counterfeit tickets police said thursday 
its certainly surprising that people in those positions would 
risk their careers and good names to save 100 on a commutation 
ticket said dan brucker spokesman for the metronorth commuter 
railroad 
the names of those arrested have not been released but brucker 
said that besides the corporate attorney one is the vice president 
of an insurance company and several are thought to be earning 
sixfigure salaries 
brucker said he couldnt give out the names of those arrested 
because disclosure could hamper the continuing investigation 
the railroad links new york city to its northern suburbs in new 
york state and connecticut including some of the most expensive 
towns in the region brucker said the average monthly ticket costs 
120 and the counterfeits generally sold for half of face value 
usually riders with passes simply flash the tickets at the 
conductor as he walks through the train but on occasion tickets 
are checked more closely 
brucker said that on one such day in december a corporate 
attorney had made himself a counterfeit and he was so nervous and 
jittery when presenting the ticket the conductor became 
suspicious 
the conductor notified police and the attorney was arrested when 
the train reached grand central terminal 
since then 11 others have been caught using phony monthly and 
weekly tickets metronorth police chief gerald hotopp said charges 
range from the misdemeanors theft of services and larceny to 
forgery and criminal possession of a forged instrument felonies 
that carry prison terms of up to 15 years 
in all but one case the commuter spent the night in jail

congressional democrats seem near a consensus 
that they can slice 4 billion to 7 billion or more out of 
president bushs 1991 defense budget fight off bushrecommended 
cuts in some domestic programs and limit next years deficit to 64 
billion 
they also believe they might be able to find a bit of startup 
money for domestic initiatives in such areas as education child 
care and nutrition 
but even as they solidify their plans for reworking the 123 
trillion spending plan bush unveiled last week democrats are still 
groping for an approach to one of this years hottest issues 
whether to cut the social security payroll tax 
questions are also arising over whether congress majority party 
can successfully write its own budget without republican support 
an offbeat but still striking illustration of the democrats 
desire to alter bushs budget came thursday when rep john murtha 
dpa chairman of the house appropriations defense subcommittee 
brandished a mock viking battle axe during a visit to the panel by 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell the chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff 
im afraid thats the mood of what were going to have to put 
up with the rest of this year because from what im hearing from 
members themselves republicans and democrats they expect a peace 
dividend said murtha a moderate democrat peace dividend 
refers to possible savings from cutting back the military in 
response to a reduced from the soviet union and its allies 
democrats pressed their offensive on other fronts as well at 
the joint economic committee chairman lee hamilton dind 
challenged bushs claim of having submitted a budget that met his 
campaign pledge of no new taxes 
in the budget you submitted 33 revenue changes and 20 of them 
raise revenue totaling an increase of 139 billion hamilton 
told bushs chief economic adviser michael boskin 
boskin argued that there were only minor tax increases and that 
most of the receipts would come from new and higher fees for 
government services 
and on the defense front house armed services committee 
chairman les aspin dwis accused the administration of using 
strategic arms talks with the soviets to win permission to deploy 
weapons congress does not want including nuclear missiles and a 
bomber such as the b2 
such a position by the administration is out of sync with 
congress preferences aspin said 
liberal democratic lawmakers have been complaining that bush 
should have cut far deeper than his 3033 billion defense proposal 
for next year that figure is 7 billion higher than this years 
total but 32 billion below the amount that would likely be 
needed to stay even with inflation 
liberals would like to see defense spending drop below the 290 
billion level 
but moderates such as house budget committee chairman leon 
panetta dcalif say they believe the figure will end up closer 
to the 296 billion to 299 billion range 4 billion to 7 
billion below bushs proposal panettas senate counterpart sen 
james sasser dtenn has talked about military spending in the 
291 billion to 296 billion range 
such figures would allow democrats to shield the medicare 
program for the elderly and handicapped retirement payments to 
government workers and other benefit programs from most of the 
139 billion in cuts that bush has proposed 
were looking at much less savings there panetta said 
thursday 
to hit the 64 billion deficit target required next year by the 
grammrudman balancedbudget law democrats say they will seek to 
raise the 21 billion bush proposed in new tax receipts user fees 
sales of federal assets and other collections 
they also say they will seek to change some of the components of 
that mix 
democrats believe enough room will be left in the budget for 
some new domestic initiatives a list of which party leaders are 
drawing up according to panetta that list is likely to include 
education child care nutrition health care and housing 
little of the money for those would be included in the 1991 
budget 
not everyone believes democrats can piece together a budget of 
their own that can be passed by the senate and house 
i dont think they can make a budget serving the 
constituencies they want to serve without putting new taxes in and 
they dont want to be the ones leading the way on that rep bill 
frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the house budget 
committee predicted thursday my guess is after internal 
discussions theyll decide to request negotiations with the 
administration 
democrats also still dont know what to do about a proposal by 
sen daniel moynihan dny to cut the social security payroll 
tax a levy that is raising so much money that it is shrinking the 
official size of the overall federal deficit by about 60 billion 
this year 
a team of top democrats are trying to draft a unified party 
position on the proposal which has one major problem it would add 
62 billion to the budget gap over the next two years 
were thrashing around a number of different options said 
panetta a member of the group which hopes to finish its work by 
late february

the pentagon on thursday released 12 minutes 
of dramatic videotape of the air assault on the headquarters of the 
panamanian defense force showing cannon fire blasting the buildings 
the grainy bluegray footage taken during the postmidnight 
attack on dec 20 looks like a fourth of july fireworks display 
with white streams of tracer bullets spraying about and white 
flashes of explosives bursting around the buildings 
rounds from the ac130 gunship carrying out the assault can be 
seen striking roofs and blowing out windows 
fires are visible in several structures after the attack 
the fourengine turboprop ac130 aircraft is armed with three 
kinds of weapons a 105mm howitzer a 40mm bofors cannon and a 
20mm vulcan cannon the tape was made as the plane hovered a few 
hundred feet in the air pouring fire on various targets and snipers 
the tape made from footage retrieved from the gunships own 
camera monitoring system was released following requests made by 
television networks 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said the pictures had been 
censored to remove sensitive information 
while most of the footage portrays the attack on the panamanian 
defense forces headquarters known as the comandancia it also 
shows a panamanian armored personnel carrier taking a direct hit 
and an attack on a barracks where a palm tree is toppled by hits 
from the 105mm cannon 
pentagon officials said the ac130 gunship was chosen for its 
accuracy and its ability to avoid damage to nearby buildings and 
us troops in the area

chancellor helmut kohl will tell soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev this weekend that he need not worry 
about soviet security interests as the germanys move closer to 
reunification officials said thursday 
kohl plans to fly to moscow on saturday to discuss german 
reunification with gorbachev on feb 24 kohl heads for camp david 
for similar discussions with president bush 
the united states has voiced support for german reunification as 
long as it occurs in an orderly way and does not threaten european 
stability 
but the soviets recalling the bitter experiences of world war 
ii continue to express reservations about the possibility of a 
unified german nation 
kohl said thursday any fears the germans intend to create a 
fourth reich are completely unfounded 
in an interview with west germanys zdf television network kohl 
said he is committed to making europe stronger through the process 
of reunification and hopes that in economic terms the 1990s will 
be the decade of the europeans and not of the japanese 
kohl will be accompanied by foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher when he visits the soviet union on a mission to allay 
fears of a united germany 
kohl and genscher plan to assure the soviet leadership in 
personal conversations that they are serious about their repeated 
assurances that moscows security interests will be taken into 
account during the process of uniting both german states a 
government source in bonn said 
kohl and genscher also plan to assure gorbachev and other soviet 
officials that no one in the west wants to use the reform process 
in the former east bloc to gain political power or to extend the 
reach of nato eastward another government source said 
the sources spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity 
east germany has long been the soviet unions most important 
ally as it is the warsaw pacts frontline country facing west 
germany if a united germany became a nato member that would move 
the western alliance much closer to the soviet unions frontiers 
nato has about 255000 troops in west germany most of them 
americans more than 380000 soviet soldiers are stationed in east 
germany 
since the fall prodemocracy movement that ousted the hardline 
communist leadership in east germany there have been increased 
calls for the two german states to unite 
the tempo picked up rapidly this week with kohl calling for the 
two countries to share a currency and west germany forming a 
select committee headed by kohl to lay the groundwork for unity 
the committee thursday called for making berlin the capital once 
germany is united 
kohl on wednesday urged immediate talks with east germany on 
establishing the west german mark as the currency for both nations 
some financial experts have warned that doing this too quickly 
could weaken the west german mark 
west germanys main labor federation appealed to the federal 
government thursday to make major economic reforms in east germany 
a condition for introducing west germanys mark there 
in other developments thursday two members of a new committee 
formed to oversee the disbanding of east germanys secret police 
force said there are still about 4000 spies operating in the 
forces espionage wing 
they also said the stasi secret police kept files on 6 
million east german citizens more than a third of the country 
werner fischer and georg boehm gave the previously unpublished 
figures at a news conference the secret police force was ordered 
disbanded by the government that took over after the ouster of 
hardline leader erich honecker 
under honecker the secret police were used to crush dissent

americans took out 491 billion more in 
consumer credit than they retired in december pushing total 
consumer debt up 6 percent for the year the federal reserve said 
thursday 
the fed said consumer credit in december advanced at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 83 percent up from novembers 
revised 78 percent increase the november gain originally had been 
reported to be 72 percent 
but consumer debt rose in both months to its highest level since 
last february when it increased 538 billion consumer credit 
includes all consumer loans except mortgages 
while credit was up 6 percent for the year it still was a 
modest increase said sandra shaber an econmist with the futures 
group here debt rose 85 percent in 1988 and 75 percent in 1987 
nevertheless it shows that consumer spending continues to 
grow modestly she said its not collapsing despite the 
sluggish economy 
the category of debt that includes credit cards jumped 245 
percent in the month that included the bulk of holiday shopping 
the hike was 175 percent in november the last week of which has 
included holiday shopping in recent years 
total credit card debt outstanding rose 406 billion at an 
annual rate in december compared with 286 billion increase in 
november 
ms shaber said that while unit sales were good during the 
holiday season profits for many retailers were off because of the 
discounts they had to offer to lure purchasers 
auto loans rose a meager 11 percent to 259 million at an 
annual rate down from 19 percent in november auto loans posted a 
41 percent increase in october but sales tapered off at years 
end 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate slowed to 
a 33 percent increase to 557 million in december after rising 
10 percent in november 
mobile home debt outstanding rose 19 percent to 35 million in 
december these debts had declined for seven consecutive months 
until a one month gain in september they fell 23 percent in 
october 199 percent and november 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of 
december totaling 7171 billion

nato challenged the warsaw pact on 
thursday to accept a us proposal to remove hundreds of thousands 
of american and soviet soldiers from central europe setting a 
regional ceiling of 195000 troops for each superpower 
the north atlantic treaty organization pitching the plan at the 
23nation conventional forces in europe negotiations called for a 
mutual natowarsaw pact cap of 4700 combat aircraft for central 
europe plus 500 air defense interceptors for each side 
president bush first proposed the reduced troop levels jan 31 
it was approved tuesday at nato headquarters in brussels by a 
highlevel nato task force 
the 195000 soviet and american troop ceilings were down from 
the level of 275000 that bush proposed in may 
there was no soviet or warsaw pact reaction thursday to the 
formal nato presentation 
initial soviet reaction after bush made the proposal last week 
was generally favorable but soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady gerasimov complained the plan did not go far enough we 
must continue to have as our goal no foreign troops on foreign 
soil he said 
in brussels a senior nato official who demanded anonymity said 
the west expected a response at a meeting next week of the two 
alliances in ottawa canada 
the open skies gathering there is officially being held to 
review a plan for unarmed reconnaisance flights over rival alliance 
territories a proposal designed to reduce eastwest tensions 
the official also said the nato allies agreed to narrow the 
definition of combat helicopters to focus on those equipped with 
antitank and airtoair guided missile capability 
the nato proposal maintains the previous limit for combat 
helicopters of 1900 for each side officials have previously said 
that both nato and the warsaw pact agreed on the number but not on 
the definition of combat helicopters 
with democratic reform in the soviet bloc putting eastwest 
relations at their best since the late 1940s negotiators for both 
sides are under pressure to reach an agreement by years end 
the soviets are also being pressured by some of their formal 
military allies which are rapidly moving toward westernstyle 
democracy hungary and czechoslovakia have begun talks with the 
soviets separate from the vienna negotiations on pulling out red 
army contingents from their countries 
while the hungarians seek withdrawal of the approximately 50000 
soviet troops in their country by 1991 czechoslovakia wants all of 
the 75000 soviet troops on its soil out by the end of this year 
poland hungary and czechoslovakia also have announced troop 
cuts of their own 
there appears to be growing sentiment within nato that the 
warsaw pact is not the threat it used to be and that some troop 
reductions should begin even before formal agreement at the vienna 
talks belgium has said recently it is studying pulling some of its 
troops from west germany 
the 16 western participants believe that the cfe negotiations 
must keep pace with the political changes now sweeping the european 
continent said a nato statement presented to reporters one 
area where this is most relevant is manpower 
to that end we now propose that neither the united states nor 
the soviet union shall station more than 195000 ground and air 
force personnel each within the area comprising the territory of 
belgium czechoslovakia denmark the federal republic of germany 
the german democratic republic hungary luxembourg the 
netherlands and poland said the statement 
the soviet union has an estimated 565000 troops stationed in 
europe outside its borders with well over 500000 of them within 
the central zone there are about 305000 us troops in western 
europe with approximately 250000 of those stationed in the area

the federal communications commission on 
thursday proposed new regulations aimed at making it easier for 
wireless cable television systems to compete with their wired 
counterparts 
the commission which is bent on improving competition in a 
cable tv industry beset by complaints of rate increases and poor 
service voted 40 to consider eliminating multiple ownership 
restrictions on microwave radio channels used by wireless cable 
systems increase permissible power output establish new 
interference requirements and improve wireless cables access to 
underused frequencies 
those and other proposed changes plus streamlined applications 
would help wireless cable become a competitive spur to wired 
cable system operators the fcc said 
the commissions notice inviting public comment said most of 
the rules at issue were adopted in the infancy of the various 
services they govern and did not anticipate the potential of a 
wireless cable service to compete in todays multichannel video 
marketplace 
many existing rules the fcc said are now individually 
inappropriate and also are inconsistent from service to service 
the fcc also said it would consider reallocating to wireless 
cable some frequencies now reserved for instructional television 
and other private services 
fcc commissioner sherrie marshall said the proposed changes were 
part of an effort to create a level playing field between wired 
and wireless cable 
wireless cable uses microwave radio instead of coaxial cable 
to reach its customers microwave radio beams signals from one 
point to another unlike ordinary overtheair broadcasting which 
spreads in all directions using longer wavelengths these microwave 
links must be licensed by the fcc 
wireless cable systems usually combine standard tv broadcast 
receiving equipment with special microwave equipment to provide 
nonbroadcast and broadcast signals to homes schools apartment 
buildings and businesses not wired for coaxial cable 
wireless cable systems claim they cant compete effectively with 
wired cable systems because they lack large channel capacity and 
because cable tv programmers such as home box office refuse to give 
them programs at fair prices accusations that hbo denies 
robert l schmidt president of the wireless cable association 
said the commissions decision was a positive step toward 
assuring that wireless cable is a viable competitor 
but schmidt said the commissions actions did not address the 
fundamental problem impeding the wireless cable industry 
restricted availability of fairly priced programming 
schmidt said he hoped some of these problems would be resolved 
in two inquiries into the cable tv business the fcc is expected to 
finish by summer 
in other actions thursday the commission voted 40 to 
propose creation of an entrylevel communicator class of 
amateur radio license that would not require ham operators to know 
morse code the commission said it wanted to open amateur radio to 
young technically oriented people who dont want to learn morse 
code 
streamline the application process for am radio license 
applications and changes 
propose additional channels for mobilesatellite radio services

the communist government cracked down on the movement for democracy 
last june 
meeting behind closed doors representatives of the 151 
governments that own the bank approved a 30 million loan for 
relief from earthquakes that hit northern china in october barber 
b conable the american who is president of the bank did not ask 
for action at this session on 780 million worth of loans he had 
postponed in june 
president bush later asked that the loans be held up 
china and india are the largest borrowers from the bank as of 
july 1 it had lent china nearly 87 billion 
a spokesman for the treasury speaking anonymously said a us 
representative on the board of executive directors supported the 
loan on thursday he said he did not know who was sitting at the 
session for the united states its official member is e patrick 
coady a treasury official 
officials of the bank said none of the 22 board members opposed 
the loan 
the approval had been foreshadowed wednesday when conable put it 
on the program for thursdays meeting the united states is the 
biggest shareholder in the bank but does not completely control its 
decisions the bank occasionally grants loans despite us 
objections

the number of new aids cases in the united states 
rose just 9 percent in 1989 the slowest increase ever but the 
disease is spreading faster among heterosexuals newborns women 
and southerners federal aids specialists reported thursday 
a total of 35238 aids cases were reported in 1989 by the 
national centers for disease control compared with 32196 reported 
during 1988 that 9 percent increase is easily the slowest since 
the spread of aids began in the early 1980s for example aids was 
up 34 percent in 1988 and 60 percent in 1987 
this is somewhat of a continuing trend said dr ruth 
berkelman chief of aids surveillance for the atlantabased cdc 
there has been a leveling in reported cases 
the cdc also attempts to tabulate aids cases according to when 
they were first diagnosed in the latest 12month period of that 
survey october 1988 through september 1989 the annual increase 
was similarly modest a 14 percent rise over the preceding 12 
months the cdc said 
the two tabulations differ somewhat in part because of case 
reporting delays revisions in the standards for reporting of aids 
cases and other factors 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the immune systems 
ability to ward off lifethreatening infections and illnesses it 
is transmitted chiefly through blood and body fluids most often 
through sexual contact or contaminated drug needles 
of the 35238 new aids cases reported in 1989 56 percent 
occurred among homosexual and bisexual males as has been the case 
in previous years the cdc said but those cases among gay and 
bisexual men were up only 8 percent over 1988 levels while 
heterosexualcontact cases just 4 percent of the total were up 
27 percent compared with the previous year 
cases diagnosed among homosexualbisexual men continued to 
increase but not as rapidly as in previous years the cdc said 
in its weekly report 
i think the leveling off reflects both a reduction in the 
number of new infections among homosexual and bisexual men and 
also the introduction of some effective therapies such as the drug 
azt in 1987 delaying the onset of aids itself among infected 
persons ms berkelman said 
in 1989 547 cases of aids transmission from mothers to newborns 
were reported up 17 percent from 1988 and while females made up 
just 3931 of the 35238 cases last year that was an increase of 
11 percent over 1988 the number of male aids cases last year was 
up 9 percent from the preceding year 
other larger proportional increases occurred in the south up 22 
percent over 1988 in population areas of less than 100000 up 35 
percent and in areas of 100000 to 500000 people up 32 percent 
among the regions the south accounted for the largest 
proportion of aids cases reported in 1989 31 percent compared 
with 30 percent in the northeast 24 percent in the west and 10 
percent in the midwest 
and the majority of cases 70 percent occurred in cities of a 
million people or more 
the number of new aids cases among hemophilia patients actually 
dropped 5 percent in 1989 from 339 in 1988 to 321 and the cases 
associated with blood transfusions dropped 14 percent from 935 to 
808 improved screening of blood donations since the aids epidemic 
began has reduced the danger from new transfusions and from the 
blood products used by hemophiliacs 
but in iv intravenous drug users we have not seen such 
optimism ms berkelman said iv drug abusers still make up the 
second largest group of aids patients and the 7970 such cases in 
1989 marked a 5 percent increase over 88 
nationwide the cdc has reported 117781 cases since aids 
reporting began in 1981 sixty percent have occurred in homosexual 
or bisexual men and 21 percent have occurred among iv drug 
abusers with 7 percent among patients in both categories 
aids has killed 70313 of the 117781 reported patients or 60 
percent

the united states and the soviet union made 
headway thursday toward new arms control agreements and also 
considered a joint condemnation of israels resettlement of jewish 
immigrants on the west bank 
a halfdozen senior us officials made no mention of the jewish 
settlers in a briefing summing up more than seven hours of talks 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
however gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman said it is quite possible that as a result of the 
sovietamerican talks a common viewpoint will be expressed on this 
issue condemning israels attempt to resettle immigrants on 
someone elses occupied territory 
there are no differences between the united states and us on 
this issue he said 
a heavy influx of immigrants to israel has been caused in part 
by the lowering of soviet emigration barriers and by limits on how 
many soviet jews the united states is willing to take in 
gerasimov said the united states had informed the soviet 
delegation the annual us quota would be raised to 60000 or 
70000 currently 50000 soviet jews are permitted to enter the 
united states as refugees annually in the first four months of 
this fiscal year which began oct 1 some 21000 were admitted 
the us officials speaking only on condition of anonymity 
said baker and shevardnadze made progress toward treaties to curb 
longrange nuclear weapons ground troops tanks and combat 
aircraft in europe and to ban production of chemical weapons 
both shevardnadze and deputy foreign minister alexander 
bessmertnykh echoed the positive us appraisal the discussion 
of the disarmament problem is proceeding very well shevardnadze 
told tass the soviet news agency 
bessmertnykh who specializes in us relations was quoted by 
tass as saying both sides had presented new ideas narrowing the 
gap between their positions 
gerasimov called the discussion very technical and said it 
would keep us and soviet experts busy through the night sorting 
the proposals out 
baker offered at least one concession that would permit the 
soviets to exclude from a projected ceiling some of the combat 
aircraft they contend are defensive 
the soviets meanwhile dropped their demand for a provision 
that would allow them to scrap a longrange missilereduction 
agreement if they determined us antimissile defenses in space 
were illegal 
but the us official who reported the concession acknowledged 
that the treaty which president bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev intend to sign at their washington summit meeting in 
june would include a common escape clause either side could 
abandon the restrictions if it concluded the treaty did not serve 
its national interest 
the separate briefings produced evidence of discord too 
gerasimov said the united states still flatly refuses to 
consider reducing naval forces and he said the soviets would not 
sign the treaty if a dispute over sealaunched cruise missiles was 
not resolved 
the bush administration refuses to accept limitations on the 
weapons carried aboard nuclear submarines and surface ships 
and when baker expressed concern to shevardnadze about published 
reports the soviets were shipping latemodel mig29 fighter bombers 
to cuba the foreign minister brushed him aside 
they made clear they have particular commitments to cuba a 
us official said the foreign minister stated his views very 
vigorously 
the surprise of the second day of talks was the soviet 
disclosure of a joint approach on jewish settlements 
only about 1 percent to 2 percent of the jews now emigrating to 
israel in record numbers are settled on the land the arabs lost in 
the 1967 sixday war overall there are 70000 jews on the west 
bank and in gaza compared to an estimated 14 million to 175 
million palestinian arabs 
still the state department echoing arab complaints has 
denounced the settlement of more jews in the territories as an 
obstacle to peace 
on the arms control front shevardnadze registered general 
approval of bushs proposal last week to reduce us and soviet 
troops in europe to a maximum of 225000 on each side with no more 
than 195000 in central europe 
us officials said they expected a more specific reply when 
baker meets with gorbachev on friday 
the soviet leader has advanced even broader disarmament schemes 
of his own 
the net result of the talks so far is that the superpowers 
steadily more cooperative relationship apparently will not be 
inhibited by the communist party central committee meeting that was 
concluded after bakers arrival here from czechoslovakia wednesday 
night 
in fact shevardnadze said it will mean that we have more 
elements of trust in our relationship we simply cannot afford 
lowering our international activity 
shevardnadze broke away from the central committee meeting on 
wednesday night for a 3hour session with baker filling in the 
us secretary of state on the changes taken at the direction of 
gorbachev 
the principal one was a decision to revoke the

a state supreme court justice arrested on 
drunken driving charges last year has been publicly reprimanded by 
his colleagues 
justice robert l clifford 65 the secondranking member of the 
states highest court pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated 
and refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test after his car was 
stopped by police oct 12 
we believe that any judge convicted of driving while 
intoxicated should be publicly reprimanded the supreme court 
reprimand issued wednesday states it noted that the high court has 
resisted efforts to weaken the states drunken driving laws 
when a judge commits such an offense the statement 
continued the publics confidence in the judiciary is inevitably 
affected 
the public reprimand was made by cliffords fellow justices as a 
result of a recommendation made by the advisory committee on 
judicial conduct one member of the committee said clifford should 
be privately admonished in a letter but the justices said they 
believe they have the power to reprimand one of their own members 
and the offense justified it 
clifford was treated in this matter precisely as any citizen 
would have been the reprimand stated no favors were asked 
suggested or granted the penalty was that almost invariably 
imposed for a first offense 
clifford would not comment on the reprimand wednesday 
in addition to the reprimand from his colleagues a lower court 
had ordered clifford to pay 615 in fines and court costs give up 
his license fo a year and attend 10 sessions of the states 
program for counseling and educating drunken drivers he could have 
received up to 30 days in jail

aids impairs mental performance only in 
people who also display other symptoms suggesting those who are 
infected with the aids virus but otherwise healthy can hold jobs 
involving public safety scientists said thursday 
the research is significant because it indicates that testing 
people for the aids virus cant predict whether the virus already 
has damaged their mental abilities said dr barbara visscher a 
coauthor of the study and an epidemiologist at the university of 
california los angeles 
the results released thursday were published in februarys 
issue of the journal neurology the findings are part of a larger 
study of aids conducted by researchers at ucla johns hopkins 
university in baltimore northwestern university in chicago and the 
university of pittsburgh 
people who are infected by the aids virus human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv normally take several years before 
they develop symptoms and are diagnosed as having acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
the findings suggest that people who are infected with the hiv 
virus but have no symptoms of aids are perfectly capable of 
holding down jobs demanding cognitive mental performance and may 
assume responsibility for public safety the university said in a 
summmary of the research 
the new study involved 1580 homosexual and bisexual men who 
were tested from 1986 through 1988 for speed of motor skills 
attention and concentration memory manual dexterity and language 
skills 
the men were divided into four groups 769 men who werent 
infected 620 who were infected but had no symptoms 107 who became 
infected during the course of the study but lacked symptoms and 84 
diagnosed with aids symptoms 
the men with aids were most likely to fail the various tests 
including those that measured manual dexterity and rapid problem 
solving requiring a physical response but the researchers found no 
difference between the men who werent infected and those who were 
infected but hadnt developed aids symptoms 
many aids patients suffer dementia or a loss of intellectual 
skill and other signs of nervous system impairment during the 
final stages of the deadly disease but there was little previous 
evidence on when such changes started 
this is the first time we have been able to document 
continuing normal cognitive mental function over a long period 
with a very large group of hivinfected subjects said dr eric 
miller director of the study at ucla

government and church officials paid 
homage thursday to cardinal jozsef mindszenty whose defiance of 
stalinist leaders 40 years ago made him a symbol of the conflict 
between marxism and the church 
the trial of the primate and those sentenced with him involved 
illegal means and was based on falsehood said matyas szueros 
hungarys interim president 
his political opponents sought to defeat him by illegal means 
the lesson of his example teaches us that we need to bring about 
such a democratic society in which differences in opinion cannot 
lead to show trials repression incarceration and revenge 
mindszenty was sentenced to life in prison on trumpedup treason 
charges he died in 1975 
thousands of roman catholic faithful gathered in the basilica of 
esztergom seat of the nations catholic primate for a mass 
celebrated jointly by cardinal agostino casaroli the vatican 
secretary of state and cardinal laszlo paskai of hungary 
casaroli arrived wednesday on a fiveday visit that is to 
include formal restoration of the relations communists severed 45 
years ago 
hungary a leader in soviet bloc reforms leading to democracy 
will be the second soviet bloc country to restore full diplomatic 
relations with the vatican poland the native land of pope john 
paul ii did so in july 
after the mass szueros and the church leaders unveiled a 
goldetched plaque of black marble that said 
here lived and fought for the freedom of the hungarian nation 
and the church until his arrest on dec 26 1948 jozsef 
mindszenty cardinal prince primate and archbishop of esztergom 
on the 41st anniversary of his sentencing the city of esztergom 
creates a monument to him by renaming this square 
the square previously dedicated to communist heroes is just 
below the towering basilica and the site of the archbishops palace 
and seminary the 19th century basilica on a hill overlooking the 
danube where an 11th century church had stood isa visible for 
miles 
after the mass those who attended walked down the steep slopes 
to what was now mindszenty square older men and women had tears in 
their eyes as they sang the national anthem together with leaders 
of the hungarian church 
hungarys chief prosecutor has concluded mindszentys trial was 
purely political and the supreme court is reviewing it 
on wednesday the official news agency mti said the chief 
prosecutor might reopen the case with the possibility of a retrial 
and formal rehabilitation 
as he pulled the white silk covering from the plaque on the 
seminary wall szueros said let this occasion be a symbolic 
event of national reconciliation let cardinal jozsef mindszety 
take his proper place in hungarys history 
in a message read by casaroli during the mass john paul 
described mindszenty as an example for the catholic world who 
dedicated himself to the church with great passion 
mindszenty was arrested in 1948 and tried the following year he 
was freed during the antistalinist uprising of 1956 but a soviet 
invasion crushed the revolt 
the cardinal took refuge in the us embassy until 1971 when he 
left under an agreement worked out by the vatican and the hungarian 
government after a short stay in rome mindszenty settled in 
vienna where he died may 6 1975 at age 83 
parliament passed a law jan 24 that separates church and state 
ending state interference in church affairs and grants all 
denominations full autonomy separate legislation legislation is 
planned on the return of confiscated church assets 
under pressure from the stalinist leadership hungarys catholic 
church surrendered its autonomy on aug 30 1950 cardinal paskai 
and premier miklos nemeth formally annulled the law tuesday

china has been authorized to buy an additional 
1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department announced thursday 
undersecretary richard t crowder said the wheat will be 
available to china under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 
367 bushels of wheat 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
the subsidies have averaged from around 10 per ton to more 
than 40 per ton of wheat or in the range of 27 cents to about 
110 per bushel 
china bought 299150 tons under eep arrangements on monday 
leaving only 1050 tons in the previous allocation the subsidy 
announced for that deal was 1028 per ton or about 28 cents per 
bushel 
purchases of us wheat for 198990 delivery total about 57

consumer advocates and an insurance industry 
group said thursday that a study of 106 former and current state 
insurance commissioners showed about half of them obtained jobs 
with insurance companies after they left office 
the study highlights the short period of time many 
commissioners served and the number of former commissioners who 
immediately moved to the industry after leaving office said 
stephen brobeck executive director of the consumer federation of 
america 
the study was released by the consumer insurance interest group 
and the national association of professional insurance agents 
which said state insurance commissioners should be prohibited from 
working directly or indirectly for the industry for one year after 
leaving office to avoid the reality or appearance of conflict of 
interest 
the survey found that 49 percent of the former commissioners 
worked for insurance companies or provided legal accounting or 
other professional services to the industry after leaving office 
their study is incomplete and does not support that sweeping 
conclusion said earle palmeroy president of the national 
association of insurance commissioners 
theyve made no conclusion that the regulation of individual 
commissioners was affected by their later work for the industry 
said palmeroy the north dakota commissioner 
palmeroy also objected to the groups inclusion of commissioners 
who later worked for law and accounting firms that had insurance 
companies as clients 
insurance commissioners are appointed or elected to state boards 
to regulate insurance rates allocate insurance premium taxes and

he said they told him that even if he could get through their 
programs they could not afford to squander their scarce resources 
on someone who would be obviously unemployable 
dole said that the civil rights field has been focused almost 
exclusively on discrimination based on race color and creed he 
said discrimination against the disabled deserves far more 
emphasis

federal officials should attack the 300 
billion business of laundering drug money with steps ranging from a 
banking summit to supermarketstyle bar codes on 20 bills a 
senator said thursday 
we hope that the administration will get off the dime and get 
moving on this sen john kerry dmass told a news conference 
at which he released a wideranging report on the laundering of 
proceeds of drug sales 
he recommended a summit between top bankers and officials of the 
state and treasury departments aimed at speeding action he also 
called on the senate banking committee to launch an investigation 
of the laundering of cash missing as part of the savings and loan 
industry crisis 
kerry called for aggressive pursuit of information from foreign 
banks backed up by the threat of real sanctions adding that 
officials should look hard at allowing banks to keep part of 
any laundered money found 
banks should be required to know their customers and real names 
not aliases should be required on checks kerry said he said 
there should be federal requirements for check cashing operations 
such as currency exchanges 
some recovered money should be funneled into the effort to 
combat crime in highintensity drug areas he said and money 
should be stamped with bar codes that would allow computerized 
tracking of the flow of currency 
the report based on testimony last fall before the senate 
foreign relations and banking committees quoted assistant treasury 
secretary salvatore martoche as estimating that drug revenues total 
300 billion annually including 110 billion generated in the 
united states 
it said much of the money laundered worldwide comes from 
criminal activities other than drug sales such as loan sharking 
but that narcotics represents a major portion laundering is not 
always simple it said 
for example 100 billion in 20 bills a denomination often 
used in drug transactions would weigh 26 million pounds the 
report said 
a money laundering operation in new york shut down earlier 
this year required a tractortrailer to haul away 19 million in 
small bills it said 
the report said the 1970 bank secrecy act is working as a 
deterrent to money laundering through american financial 
institutions the measure requires the institutions to report cash 
deposits of 10000 or more 
however the report said that drug traffickers continue to use 
foreign banks and foreign branches of us banks to launder us 
drug profits 
switzerland canada the bahamas luxembourg panama and hong 
kong are among the main countries where money is laundered the 
report said adding that criminals are pushing to develop money 
laundering centers in a number of tiny countries ranging from 
andorra to vanuatu 
the report said the government has no policy on control of 
international electronic transfers of us funds 
as a consequence money launderers retain a choice of methods 
to conceal their laundered funds through international wire 
transfers including informal channels involving fax machines 
telex personal computer networks and ordinary telephone 
instructions which do not leave the paper trail which would allow 
investigators to follow the flow of funds it said

an explosion ripped through a coal mine in 
northern turkey trapping more than 50 miners inside and officials 
said thursday that they had cut off ventilation to the shaft to 
help extinguish the blaze because there was no hope of finding any 
more survivors 
two miners survived the wednesday night blast in the stateowned 
yeniceltik coal mine in merzifon 240 miles northeast of ankara 
near the black sea officials said 
rescuers also recovered eight bodies but 58 others are believed 
entombed in the mine union leader ekrem sami said 
it is the end for all trapped down there which is an 
inferno said sami secretary general of madenis the 
mineworkers union tons of coal are burning there now there is 
little that can be done 
the cause of the accident was not immediately determined but 
union officials blamed lax safety measures at the mine for the 
blast which occurred a day after the labor ministry said mines in 
the region had few safeguards 
dozens of soldiers formed a ring around the mine to prevent 
loved ones from getting close the independent hurriyet news agency 
reported families were upset over the decision to seal the mine 
shaft ruling out any possibility of rescue the agency said 
government television showed the relatives of miners wailing and 
shouting at the site of the accident 
sami said a small fire set off the explosion of pit gas largely 
made of methane the blast in turn ignited a giant blaze he said 
he said one of the two rescued miners had died later of severe 
burns but doctors at nearby samsun university hospital said the 
miner was still alive though in critical condition 
state minister mehmet yazar told reporters that all ventilation 
channels to the mine were closed to cut off air feeding the blaze 
the ventilation was ordered cut off when it appeared dense smoke 
left no hope the trapped miners could survive he said 
celalettin cakir manager of the mine said in an interview with 
the state television that the fire was spreading and any rescue 
effort was impossible under the circumstances 
hurriyet quoted hamit ozturk local head of the union accusing 
the management that they failed to evacuate the mine in time even 
though they were aware of the accumulation of methane gas at the 
pit cakir denied the allegation hurriyet reported 
sevket yilmaz president of turkis turkeys largest labor 
union confederation told reporters at the site this is no work 
accident this is murder because of neglect of safety standards 
the semiofficial anatolia news agency reported this was the 
fourth accident in the history of the yeniceltik mine owned by the 
municipality of merzifon and the governmentowned sugar co 
in 1965 a similar explosion killed 72 at the same mine the 
dispatch said 
in 1983 there were 102 victims of an explosion in the northern 
province of zonguldak 
the state sector and the private sector are equally guilty of 
negligence in all coal mines in turkey the conditions are 
primitive sami alleged 
he said 800 miners worked in yeniceltik but there were 68 miners 
in the shaft hit by the explosion during the evening shift 
the disaster struck a day after the labor ministry published a 
report deploring the inadequacy of safety standards in turkeys 
coal mines in the northern region 
the report criticized the mines for not having fireproof 
uniforms or artificial breathing apparatus 
the report was prepared during the course of the investigation 
of 26 deaths and 7433 injuries in the pits last year 
officials estimate 1000 people have lost their lives in mine 
accidents the past 15 years

reports that a group of highranking el 
salvadoran military officers met shortly before six jesuit priests 
were murdered in november are being investigated the state 
department said thursday 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs was subjected to tough questioning at a senate 
appropriations subcommittee meeting about el salvadors human 
rights record particularly the governments handling of the 
investigation of the jesuit killings 
el salvador has indicted eight members of the military 
including col guillermo alfredo benavides in the slayings 
sen thomas harkin diowa asked aronson what he knew about a 
reported meeting of 30 military officers in san salvador on nov 
15 the day before the killings 
harkin said among those reportedly attending the meeting were 
benavides the armed forces chief of staff rene emilio ponce and 
a top intelligence official 
i think its being looked into aronson said adding that 
the us embassy in san salvador is helping the salvadorans in the 
investigation 
but harkin called for a more pointed investigation to determine 
if el salvadoran military officials might have been involved in 
ordering the killings 
it seems to me the circumstantial evidence is that there was 
discussion and orders were given harkin said 
however aronson said harkin had not produced such evidence 
sen patrick leahy dvt the panels chairman criticized the 
reagan and bush administrations for continuing to provide military 
and economic aid to el salvador without insisting on an end to 
activity by rightwing death squads 
sarcastically he said the administrations efforts to condition 
aid would have had more teeth in it if we said well cut you off 
from the book of the month club 
but aronson said as recently as last week that el salvadors 
president alfredo christiani was warned that congress might 
reduce the aid if his government did not improve its human rights 
aronson said the aid expected to total 315 million in fiscal 
1990 has prevented the rebels battling the government from 
taking over el salvador and imposing another dreary vicious 
marxist dictatorship upon a nation and a people that want to live 
in a democracy 
six democratic senators have called for a cutoff of aid to el 
salvador this year but earlier efforts to end the assistance or 
make it conditional have failed in the house and senate 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate 
subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs took the middle ground 
at a capitol hill news conference 
dodd proposed legislation that immediately would cut military 
aid to el salvador in half if the salvadoran government failed to 
pursue peace negotiations with rebel forces all aid would be cut 
conversely should the rebels cut off negotiations or launch an 
offensive full military aid would be restored 
if i were convinced that cutting off all aid would end the war 
tomorrow and preserve a democratic government i would support 
that dodd said

the following is the full text of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs concluding remarks at the soviet communist 
party central committees plenary meeting as reported thursday by 
the official tass news agency 
to cut the long story short i will say only a few words to sum 
up the major discussion that was held in the hall of sessions of 
the party central committees plenums during the past three days 
i think that the discussion at the plenum on the entire range of 
issues was adequate to the dimension and novelty of the documents 
and problems that we discussed 
the plenum can be described in the following way it revealed 
the immense concern and immense anxiety of the central committee 
and the party in general over the situation in the country and in 
connection with the course of perestroika processes 
the plenum made a harsh critical analysis of all perestroika 
processes and forecast on its basis what is to be done and in what 
way this found reflection in the political guidelines that we 
placed at the basis of the soviet communist party central 
committees platform 
this is probably one more time after the work on resolutions of 
the 19th party conference that the entire central committee worked 
on the document in the sweat of its brow so to say i make the 
following very important conclusion all activity keenness and 
passions that emerged here all this reflects in one way or 
another the manifestation of concern about the party about the 
fate of perestroika and about giving correct political guidelines 
for society on the part of the ruling party at this very crucial 
stage of perestroika 
i think comrades that despite the diversity of views which 
was obvious at the plenum down to opposite positions that clashed 
here partially due to the lack of restraint this is all 
forgivable all comrades were unanimous that a progressive 
document was required a document that calls forward rather than 
backward in my opinion this is the dominant view 
i think that in some area of work there is a need to use some of 
the old mechanisms when new ones have not yet started working 
society should not be left rudderless and without sails without 
means that are able to advance perestroika in our huge country 
but the prevalent opinion which was endorsed in the soviet 
communist party central committees platform is that it is 
necessary to handle pressing problems along the tracks of 
perestroika renewal of society and renewal of the soviet communist 
party this is the main thing 
now one more thing or the reverse side of the medal i would 
say it is now not only by brain but literally by all skin do we 
feel that we must act resolutely the central committee the 
government and the supreme soviet should act 
i mention them not in order to give them instructions no we 
are expressing our position the main thing is that communists who 
are members of these bodies should act on the basis of this 
appraisal 
we cannot waste any more time it was fair to say to the party 
central committee it is inadmissible to be late now it is 
necessary to take the lead in stormy and complicated processes in 
order to support healthy trends consolidate them and try to 
overcome or inhibit destructive trends 
communists in the government should also act i think that 
comrades were right when they told party members working in the 
government that during the discussion of the platform at the plenum 
we did not hear their viewpoint 
it was said that there was such a discussion at the second 
congress of peoples deputies this is no argument it was 
necessary to have a discussion here as well the more so for the 
government is now handling practical things and it had what to say 
it was important for the central committee members to check 
these steps and orient the entire party to support and consolidate 
them above all to state our support for the program approved by 
the congress 
but i think that the government will find a way to inform 
central committee members and secretaries of party committees so 
that they clearly and fully realize all the specifics 
it is necessary to act in the supreme soviet from which major 
decisions are expected on key issues of perestroika and the 
improvement of the situation in the country communists should act 
vigorously and efficiently in all sectors in general we ought to 
consolidate forces by regrouping them and resolutely to advance 
perestroika and practical deeds 
the deeper we enter perestroika and explore all its strata the 
greater crystallization of positions and interests of opposing 
sides become we felt its presence here as well this is a 
reflection of the entire life of our society

drug traffickers trying to convince the 
government they want peace returned a helicopter they stole a year 
ago and said thursday they were not responsible for threats to the 
national soccer team 
the helicopter stolen from the colombian company helicol was 
left in the jungle in the northeastern state of choco according to 
a statement sent to news media thursday by the medellin cartel 
cocaine gang it said several cocaine processing labs would be 
surrendered in a few days 
in recent weeks the traffickers have freed six of the 21 
hostages police say they hold turned over a ton of dynamite and 
halted a bombing campaign that killed 199 people in four months 
leaders of the medellin cartel who call themselves the 
extraditables because of their vulnerability to extradition said 
last month they would abandon the cocaine trade in exchange for 
constitutional and legal guarantees 
they did not say what assurances they wanted but most officials 
believe ending extradition to the united states is the main 
objective 
president virgilio barcos government has sent 14 suspects to 
the united states for trial since it declared war on colombias 
cocaine gangs in august nine others await extradition 
officials said repeatedly they will never negotiate with 
traffickers and that cocaine barons should surrender if they want 
peace 
thursdays statement denied suggestions by the acting national 
police chief gen carlos arturo casadiego that traffickers were 
behind threats to the national soccer team which has qualified for 
the 1990 world cup tournament in italy 
coach francisco maturana said earlier this week he might keep 
the team out of the tournament because of threats made in a 
telephone call to a radio network by a group calling itself the 
cleaning of colombian soccer 
a recorded message played over the telephone claimed the group 
represented gamblers who had lost millions of dollars because 
members of team fixed games on instructions from drug traffickers 
the extraditables said some soccer figures were connected with 
traffickers but the cocaine dealers would never try to destroy the 
sport 
in colombias continuing war with insurgents two guerrillas 
from a group that has promised to lay down its arms this month were 
found floating dead in a river and five rebels six soldiers and a 
member of a leftist party were killed in political violence police 
reported 
police said they found two members of the april 19 movement 
known as m19 in the magdalena river near pitalitio 250 miles 
south of bogota 
an m19 statement blamed the killings on ultraright wing 
groups and paramilitary squads 
colombias most active leftist guerrillas the national 
liberation army bombed the main petroleum pipeline thursday for 
the fifth time this year causing a fire and a spill of the 
thousands of barrels of crude oil the state oil company ecopetrol 
reported 
the pipeline runs more than 400 miles from the canon limon oil 
field on the venezuelan border to covenas a caribbean port the 
guerrillas have made more than 180 attacks on oil facilities since 
1986 
barcos government and m19 are to sign an agreement wednesday 
providing for the estimated 900 guerrillas to surrender their arms 
feb 22 in return for amnesty and the right to form a political 
party

the stateowned newspaper alakhbar said 
friday that police arrested one of two terrorists who attacked a 
tour bus with machine guns and hand grenades on feb 3 and killed 
nine israelis 
on thursday the paper said investigators viewed videotape shot 
during the ambush the tapes owner said it showed the terrorists 
faces 
alakhbar did not identify the arrested man by name or 
nationality friday nor did it give attribution for its page one 
story 
the paper also ran an editorial attacking israeli trade minister 
ariel sharon for remarks it said he made holding egypt responsible 
for the attack 
police have said the attack was planned outside egypt and a 
palestinian connection is being investigated interior minister 
abdelhalim moussa said wednesday his investigators found the 
attack was mounted by nonegyptians 
the bus was carrying 31 israeli tourists to cairo from rafah a 
divided town on the border with israel it was ambushed 40 miles 
northeast of cairo on the desert road between the capital and the 
suez canal city of ismailiya 
besides nine killed 20 israelis and an egyptian tour guide were 
wounded 
alakhbar has learned that the interior ministrys security 
apparatus has arrested the terrorist who participated with his 
partner in the attack on the israeli tourists bus the newspaper 
said friday 
it said thursday one terrorist was arrested but it was unclear 
whether the arrest was of a gunman or a palestinian suspected of 
driving the car used by the attackers 
a ministry spokesman refused comment 
alakhbar said the videotape was shot by pinchas first a 
wounded israeli survivor and ran for three minutes it quoted the 
israeli newspaper hadashot as saying first began filming when the 
assault began and the video recorder kept running after he was hurt 
i used my camera right from the start of the attack and im 
sure that i managed to film the assailants first was quoted as 
saying in an interview with the israeli newspaper yediot ahronot 
he was quoted as saying the gunmen wore scarves over their 
faces but the scarves fell off after they boarded the bus he said 
he turned the tape over to egyptian police 
in its editorial on sharon alahram said 
sharon is the first to know that he is at the head of those 
who are responsible for the violence and extremism that are spread 
in the region 
he is the first to realize that the seed of violence was sown 
by him and those hawks and extremists like him 
at the same time editor ibrahim nafea attacked the palestine 
liberation organization for issuing a condemnation of the ambush 
which he called weak and absolutely incompatible with the 
magnitude and horror of the accident 
terrorism benefits only the enemies of the arabs especially 
if such a crime takes place on egyptian land nafea a confidant 
of president hosni mubarak wrote 
nafeas attack indicates cairos anger at the plo for saying the 
ambush should be put in context with the death of hundreds of 
palestinians at israeli hands in the uprising in the occupied 
territories 
alahram said mubarak sent an urgent verbal message to plo 
chairman yasser arafat on thursday about recent developments in 
the middle east peace process but gave no details 
egypt is the only arab country to have a peace treaty with 
israel the mubarak government has been trying to broker 
israelipalestinian talks as a first step toward mideast peace 
a police source said about 100 people mostly palestinians were 
detained for questioning in the bus attack by late wednesday and 
that police were combing rafah which has a large palestinian 
population 
butros ghali minister of state for foreign affairs appealed 
thursday for israelis to continue visiting egypt despite the 
attack saying tourism was needed to deepen relations he spoke in 
an interview from cairo broadcast on israel radio 
ghali also called for a new peace process to encourage 
moderate voices in both the arab and israeli camps 
sharon said on israel television thursday the bus attack was 
planned by palestinians deported from occupied territories 
those who sent the killers in egypt were people terrorists who 
were deported from israel 
he named no names nor did he say what their roles were

the federal communications commission on 
thursday upheld a review boards decision that stripped from san 
francisco station kqedtv its license to operate a uhf educational 
station kqec 
the review board had ruled kqed failed to deal honestly with the 
commission 
the fcc said it will award a new license to the minority 
television project inc for a new station using kqec facilities 
provided that minority television project supplies proof it has 
received sufficient state and federal funds 
the commission said it agreed with the review boards conclusion 
that kqed officials committed serious misconduct by lacking 
candor about and misrepresenting the reasons that kqec was off the 
air from january through may 1980 
it said the record showed kqeds board of directors adopted a 
resolution authorizing the deactivation of kqec channel 32 as a 
means of alleviating kqeds financial problems 
the commission said that on three occasions after the resolution 
was adopted kqed told the commission the uhf station was closed 
for technical reasons associated with the replacement of switcher 
equipment and did not disclose the boards decision 
the commission said that it had warned kqed in 1975 that it 
considered kqeds practice of deactivating channel 32 for financial 
reasons contrary to the public interest 
the commission said that even after it learned of the boards 
resolution as the result of a complaint kqed attempted to 
characterize its action as related to the switcher replacement and 
not a general budgetary matter such conduct violates the 
fundamental duty of a licensee to deal honestly with the 
commission 
despite kqeds misconduct the commission said it was upholding 
the review boards decision to renew the license of kqedtv and 
kqedfm 
the board found that kqed did not commit the kind of pervasive 
misconduct that would have disqualified kqed from holding any 
broadcast licenses and that the loss of a single station was the 
appropriate sanction in view of the misconduct committed 
kqed may continue operating kqec for 90 days if kqed seeks 
reconsideration of the fcc order or judicial review it may 
continue to operate the station for 90 days following release of 
any reconsideration order or the completion of judicial review 
whichever is later

apartment is all my parents have it was hit by bullets but its 
still standing they want to stay with it 
then she entered west beirut at the museum crossing the only 
open gateway in the no mans land that draws a sectarian line 
through the city 
many other christians crossed to buy food and water and 
hospital officials went in search of blood supplies and medicine 
civilians have mingled peacefully on both sides of the line 
throughout the 15yearold sectarian civil war 
aoun and geagea left their big guns silent thursday in a battle 
that has killed at least 373 people and wounded 1680 many of them 
civilians since jan 30 
three mediators worked out an agreement with representatives of 
both sides that calls for a ceasefire assurance that there is 
no intention to liquidate the lebanese forces and renunciation of 
the use of arms to resolve political differences 
geagea seemed to imperil the truce when he told reporters as if 
addressing aoun general youre mad a liar an utter fool in 
politics you shouldnt think you can finish us off we shall fight 
you 100 years 
youve waged war on everyone in sight and on everything in the 
christian area let me remind you of hitlers and mussolinis 
fate 
they are fighting for control of the 310squaremile enclave 
north and east of beirut where 1 million christians live but the 
casualties include moslems killed or wounded by shells that strayed 
into west beirut 
police said geagea and aoun who has been dismissed as army 
commander but still commands the loyalty of nearly 20000 christian 
troops were reinforcing their positions and resupplying their men 
with ammunition weapons and food 
they said a first lieutenant in aouns army was killed by a 
sniper in the dora district of east beirut and st joseph hospital 
said seven civilians wounded earlier in the week died thursday 
five people were reported wounded by snipers 
aoun with a bulletproof vest under his camouflage jacket made 
a moraleboosting tour of strategic hills his troops seized from 
the militia this week at dbaye north of beirut 
his tele liban television station showed aoun in a dark blue 
beret flanked by a dozen heavily armed bodyguards talking to 
officers beside a demolished lebanese forces truck in dbaye 
the 54yearold general rarely leaves his bunker beneath the 
shattered presidential palace in baabda a christian suburb east of 
beirut he refuses to recognize president elias hrawi who fired 
him after being elected in november and has refused to leave the 
palace 
geagea a maronite catholic like aoun and hrawi said in a 
letter to pope john paul ii that aoun wanted to silence any voice 
that opposed his decisions 
aoun rejects a lebanese peace plan worked out last fall under 
arab league mediation which hrawi was elected to implement geagea 
recognizes hrawi as president but has not taken a public position 
on the peace agreement 
hundreds of people fled to west beirut from ashrafiyeh the 
militia stronghold that has seen the heaviest fighting but most 
residents of districts controlled by aoun appeared to be buying 
supplies and returning home 
youssef hayek of the furn elshubbak district which aoun 
controls said i cant wait to get the bread to the family 
and headed for the dozens of trucks moslem vendors had parked 
nearby

the top two senators on the senate 
appropriations committee are challenging the legality of a white 
house request to delay 22 billion in pentagon expenditures this 
year according to a letter released thursday 
among the postponments president bush is seeking are several 
projects that are favorites of particular members of congress 
presidents routinely ask congress to delay billions of dollars 
of planned spending each year by law those requests called 
deferrals are permissible because of unexpected contingencies or 
a chance to save money through better management 
they can be blocked by a majority vote of either house the 
requested delays however are not allowed for policy reasons 
yet according to the papers bush sent lawmakers dated feb 6 and 
released thursday the administration justifies many of the 
deferrals by stating this proposal reflects changes in 
requirements in view of promising developments in the soviet union 
and eastern europe 
senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd dwva 
and sen mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the 
appropriations panel wrote comptroller general charles a bowsher 
on wednesday asking him to review the requests 
the senators wrote that some of the requests appear to go well 
beyond the permissible housekeeping deferrals 
bowsher is chief of the general accounting office congress 
investigative agency by law the gao routinely examines 
presidential requests to delay spending 
the requested deferrals include 200 million for v22 osprey 
tilt rotor aircraft manufactured in texas and pennsylvania 593 
million for construction and conversion of navy ships work that is 
a boon to many coastal states and 325 million for the coast 
guards purchase of an icebreaker 
the secondranking republican on the appropriations panel is 
sen ted stevens of alaska where the icebreaker would presumably

the home office refused to give details of the complaint against

speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom said thursday 
the deportations were enforced for reasons of national security 
because their activities were not conducive to the public good

wetsuitclad surfers bobbed 
within a mile of a big oil slick thursday while animal lovers 
worked frantically to save sea birds coated with dark goop 
the day after the tanker american trader dumped nearly 300000 
gallons of oil into the ocean near the community known as surf 
city the scene was peaceful 
a midmorning helicopter survey showed the milelong slick as a 
giant purple blob an ugly ink spot on the smooth sea surface a 
dozen surfers rode the waves nearby apparently oblivious to the 
spill 
from the air us coast guard vessels could be seen weaving 
around the american trader helicopters carrying news crews buzzed 
above the grey and red vessel 
about three dozen people gathered on the beach and stared out 
toward the spill which really couldnt be seen from the shoreline 
on the other side of pacific coast highway oil wells pumped just 
as they do every day 
by midday just over a dozen oilcoated birds six of them dead 
had washed ashore said curt taucher of the state department of 
fish and game but offshore winds threatened to shift and steer the 
spill toward the bolsa chica wildlife sanctuary 
david thompson and mark recktenwald students at orange coast 
community college spent the afternoon walking the beach in search 
of oilsoaked birds they were supplied with gloves and boxes 
this is unfortunate that it happened thompson said but 
we all drive cars and use heaters youre kidding yourself if you 
think its the fault of capitalists i think its everyones 
responsibility to help clean this up 
thompson frequents the beach often bodysurfing beside dolphins 
he said he would return to the water as soon as its deemed safe 
desiree white 16 said i think it really stinks ill wait a 
little while before i come back here 
the placid beach scene contrasted with the frenzied atmosphere 
inside the huntington state beachs central life guard station 
where environmentalists set up a command center to rescue wildlife 
ailing birds were cleaned with dishwashing liquid and tended 
under warm lamps by volunteers 
they were completely drenched in the oil youd pick them up 
and drops would come off said christina amato a volunteer with 
the alliance for wildlife organization 
hundreds of people volunteered time or materials such as boxes 
and towels for cleanup trained workers turned down some of the 
volunteer hopefuls saying they needed professionals to help said 
state fish and game biologist esther burkett 
in your zeal in your pity you could hurt the birds she 
said 
marci lowy 24 roller skated all the way from newport beach to 
volunteer it seemed like the thing to do she said 
burkett said its too early to say what toll the spill will take 
on birds diving ducks and grebes of primary concern were 
endangered species living in area estuaries such as the american 
brown pelican peregrine falcon and the lightfooted clapper rail 
the accident recalled huntington beachs nickname the community 
of 186000 was known as oil city 70 years ago when groves of 
oil derricks stood on the shore where surfers and sunbathers now 
gather by the hundreds of thousands

political leaders thursday criticized the use 
of police force to break up a campaign march in which a leftist 
presidential candidate was shot in the leg the interior minister 
offered to resign 
president alan garcia apologized to the candidate henry pease 
and met with his cabinet thursday to discuss wednesdays incident 
in downtown lima as well as interior minister agustin mantillas 
offer to step down 
mantilla who was in charge of overseeing law enforcement 
called the police action that left at least seven people wounded 
without justification 
no statement was issued after the cabinet meeting on whether 
garcia formally accepted mantillas offer and no replacement has 
been named but mantilla said his resignation was irrevocable 
radio programas reported earlier thursday without attribution 
that garcia had accepted the resignation 
senate president humberto carranza of garcias centerleft 
aprista party said thursday he supported mantillas decision to 
resign 
if the interior minister cannot control his subordinates 
those who are under his command i believe that the principle of 
authority has been lost carranza said 
pease running in the april 8 election as the candidate for the 
united left a coalition of marxist parties was wounded when 
police fired birdshot to disperse the coalitions march near the 
government palace where garcia lives 
also wounded were two congressional candidates one of peases 
bodyguards two newspaper photographers and a number of marchers 
pease said none of those wounded was seriously injured 
the government banned the use of birdshot to break up 
demonstrations three years ago when several people were badly 
injured by the pellets during a miners strike 
the interior ministry ordered an investigation and said one 
police commander had been fired and another suspended 
pease said said mantillas resignation was necessary 
what happened yesterday should not happen to any citizen he 
told reporters we are human beings not cattle 
witnesses to wednesdays incident said the marchers tried to 
cross the plaza de armas a large public square in front of the 
government palace that has been closed off by police for several 
months to prevent a rebel attack by shining path extremists 
police detoured the marchers down a side street where the 
confrontation occurred police used tear gas water cannon and 
shotguns to disperse the marchers 
garcia named mantilla to the post last may 13 mantilla has been 
a close confidant of garcia since before garcia took office in 
1985 and has served as garcias bodyguard and minister of the 
presidency 
the favored candidate in the april election is novelist mario 
vargas llosa of the centerright democratic front coalition 
trailing him in the polls are alfonso barrantes of the socialist 
left coalition luis alva castro of the aprista party and pease 
garcia by law is not allowed run for a second consecutive 5year 
term

sen dave durenberger said thursday that he 
told the senate ethics committee that appropriate official 
bodies approved the financial dealings that sparked the panels 
investigation of his conduct 
i am comfortable in presenting my case to the ethics committee 
and letting the process take its course the minnesota republican 
said after spending about an hour minutes before the committee in a 
closeddoor meeting 
i have accepted full responsibility for my actions and i have 
acknowledged that had i to do it all over again some decisions 
would be made differently 
durenberger had requested the meeting before new allegations 
surfaced on his receipt of unsecured lowinterest loans from a st 
paul bank where his cousin is a vice president 
the committee is in its grand jury phase and is trying to 
determine whether it should proceed to the trial stage the panel 
said earlier it would make no decision thursday on how to proceed 
with the case 
durenberger who is not up for reelection until 1994 has 
apologized to constituents for mistakes in judgment more than 70 
percent of respondents in two recent minnesota polls said he should 
resign if the ethics panel finds wrongdoing 
durenberger refused to answer reporters questions after the 
meeting but said in a statement that he sought and received 
approvals from the appropriate official bodies in regard to 
financial dealings that are being questioned 
durenberger previously said the federal election commission 
approved an agreement to promote two books he wrote and that the 
senate rules and ethics committees sanctioned reimbursements he 
received for stays in a minneapolis condominium he partly owns 
the ethics panel is trying to determine whether durenberger 
broke senate rules by evading outside income limits when he made 
promotional speeches for the books improperly charged the senate 
for the condominium stays and received improper reimbursements for 
trips to boston that combined official appearances with visits to 
his marriage counselor 
durenbergers statement did not address the boston trips 
he has repaid the senate 11005 for stays in the condominium 
while the senate was not in session the repayment did not include 
weekend trips during senate sessions 
there were new disclosures wednesday that durenberger received 
13 million in unsecured lowinterest loans from the commercial 
state bank in st paul the star tribune of minneapolis published a 
list of 23 loans the bank made to durenberger over the past decade 
at interest rates as much as 65 points below prime 
a durenberger aide said the list was accurate 
durenberger however called the story a mischaracterization 
of a normal longstanding relationship with a bank and it was a 
blatant distortion of the facts 
bob weinholzer minnesota republican party chairman said in an 
interview thursday that informal gop polls show everybody thinks 
we should wait until the ethics committee makes a final ruling 
before judging durenberger 
weinholzer said he expected state democrats to increase pressure 
for durenberger to resign because democratic gov rudy perpich 
could appoint a senator from his party to serve until an election 
could be held 
last week he told me he has absolutely no intentions of 
resigning unless something major comes along in an ethics committee 
report weinholzer said about durenberger 
a st paul pioneer press dispatchwcco poll of 767 minnesota 
adults conducted from jan 1925 showed 42 percent of those polled 
give durenberger favorable marks for his performance in the senate 
and 53 percent give him unfavorable marks 
a star tribunekstptv minnesota poll of 800 adults from jan 
1723 found durenbergers approval rating had plummeted from 73 
percent in october to 41 percent in january 
both polls have an error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points 
this isnt the first time that durenberger has been in hot water 
with the ethics committee 
in april 1988 the committee criticized him for discussing an 
espionage case in public the previous year but stopped short of 
recommending disciplinary action 
some senators were said to have been angered by durenbergers 
reported disclosure that thencia director william j casey had in 
1982 changed the rules under which allies did not spy on each 
other by recruiting an israeli military officer to spy on israel 
for the united states

a leading government official said 
thursday that albania will remain unaffected by democratic reforms 
sweeping the soviet bloc but welcomes the superpowers reduced 
role in europe 
we are continuing along our own road which has been very 
different from that of the eastern bloc countries deputy foreign 
minster socrat placa told the associated press 
albania is europes last bastion of stalinism 
it is rare here that officials consent to comment spontaneously 
and on the record to western reporters this small mountainous 
nation between greece and yugoslavia is a closed society that for 
decades has been europes most conservative communist nation 
the tirana government broke with the soviet union in 1961 over 
moscows policy of destalinization and with china in 1978 because 
it viewed beijing as deviating from marxistleninist tenets 
placa said albania followed european developments with intense 
interest and welcomed any reductions of usled nato and 
sovietled warsaw pact forces from the continent the two sides are 
making progress at talks in vienna on cutting their conventional 
troop strengths 
although it takes part in few international forums and restricts 
entry by foreigners albania consistently denies being isolationist 
in arguing against the isolationist label placa used as an 
example albanias not participating in the helsinki process of 
building intereuropean trust and reducing the threat of military 
confrontation on the continent 
we have not been involved in international politics for 
example the helsinki process because that did not respect the will 
of the nations involved simply the interests of the power 
blocs he said 
albania now has diplomatic relations with 112 countries many 
of them nonaligned third world nations and placa said his country 
was interested in improving our diplomatic links both with the 
east and west 
asked about albanias relationship with the united states placa 
blamed the americans for the lack of formal ties 
it was not our making that we are not engaged in diplomatic 
relations with america really the ball is in their court 
he said 
he did not elaborate on consistent rejections by his government 
of such relations with both superpowers 
placa repeated albanian rejections of the reform process 
gripping much of eastern europe saying the turmoil has been 
due to misguided socialism bureaucracy and corruption 
we do not have that here he said 
despite militant rhetoric signs have been emerging that albania 
is slightly relaxing decades of dogma as part of a cautious move 
away from total control of society by the ruling communist party 
the state ata news agency reported sunday that a central 
committee meeting on jan 2223 agreed to give state enterprises 
more decisionmaking power permit dual candidacies and tie wages 
more closely to production 
such moves are sorely needed but will not likely be nearly 
enough to inject competition into a rigid centrally controlled 
economy that draws on an infrastructure that has changed little 
since the early 1950s 
albania has the lowest gross national product in europe 
estimated at 820 a year per capita by the world bank in 1981 the 
last year statistics were available it has about 31 million 
residents 
foreign business people said albania wants badly to increase its 
foreign trade currently a paltry 860000 a year 
the potential is there but this country has a lot to do 
before it becomes an attractive prospect said kurt felbsberger 
an italian tourism promoter on his first visit 
the bottom line here is they dont have the money to pay for 
the goods they want bartering which they would like to see is an 
antiquated form of trade said a finnish foreign trade official 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
placa told western reporters that nothing stood in the way of 
economic cooperation with the rest of europe 
there are no obstacles to increased trade and we should not be 
afraid of joint ventures he said without elaborating 
the moribund economy and resulting food shortages acknowledged 
by ata in its feb 4 report were reported partially responsible 
for riots said to have occurred in the northern city of skhoder 
jan 11 and jan 14 the violence reportedly was associated with 
anticommunist rallies there 
but placa said such reports were simply fabricated 
propaganda mainly by yugoslav statesupervised media 
albania and yugoslavias federal government are at odds over the 
fate of 19 million ethnic albanians in the yugoslav province of 
kosovo more than 25 ethnic albanians died there in the latest wave 
of unrest for more autonomy

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said thursday he was following the issue of soviet jews moving to 
israelioccupied lands and cited security council opposition to 
jewish settlements there 
arab diplomats said the problem eventually might become an issue 
in the council which is charged with maintaining international 
peace and security 
perez de cuellar said in a statement read by spokesman francois 
giuliani that he was monitoring the situation because of protests 
by arabs that the influx of soviet jewish settlers posed a 
potential threat to security and efforts toward peace in the region 
israel captured the occupied territories the west bank and gaza 
strip from jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
in los angeles a spokesman for the simon wiesenthal center told 
the associated press about 29 soviet jews had settled to the west 
bank 
giuliani told a daily news briefing perez de cuellar was mindful 
that the security council adopted a resolution in 1980 deploring 
the establishment of jewish settlements in the territories 
the league of arab states has condemned expanded settlements on 
grounds they undermine the possibility of a palestinian state in 
the territories and jeopardize peace efforts 
clovis maksoud un representative of the league said last 
week the united states should caution israel against seeking a 
big israel in the territories to accommodate big 
immigration from the soviet union 
he said settlements expanded by soviet immigration would inflame 
the volatile middle east and threaten international peace and 
security by altering the demographics of the west bank and gaza

wouldnt be unusual except the caps are made of gold and theyre 
on the students teeth 
boys and girls high school principal frank mickens said 
removable cosmetic gold caps send the wrong signal about minority 
youths 
you cant go to wall street with gold teeth or excessive 
jewelry mickens told the freshman class during an assembly 
wednesday you can be a drug dealer you can be a prostitute you 
can be a pimp 
the estimated 100 students who wear the gold caps will have 
until tuesday to doff them 
in dealing with black and hispanic young people i teach them 
they have to be beyond reproach said the principal who is 
black people have to look at them and immediately know they are 
dealing with a good young person 
were on a campaign of selfesteem he continued its my 
belief that once a kid feels good about himself he wont need the 
gold 
the cosmetic caps initially popular among drug dealers have 
become a status symbol heavyweight champion mike tyson often 
appears in public wearing one the most popular versions feature 
initials or an emblem etched into the gold and can cost up to 100 
mickens order which brought rumbles of protest from the 
assembly at the 3500student school is his latest fashion edict 
three years ago he banned excessive gold jewelry from school 
grounds since then hes banned short skirts shearling coats and 
cassette players 
board of education spokesman bob terte said mickens is entitled 
to issue his dresscode orders the determining factor is whether 
its reasonable and necessary to maintain order and discipline 
terte said 
dress codes vary from school to school he said the only 
systemwide regulation is one barring students from wearing beepers 
which are often used by drug dealers 
mickens school once regarded as one of new yorks worst is in 
the borough of brooklyns bedfordstuyvesant neighborhood an area 
plagued by crime and drugs 
since mickens arrival four years ago there have been 
improvements at boys and girls high seventy percent of its seniors 
now go on to further education 
mickens is setting kids in the right direction said 
obahdavid ward president of the schools parent teacher and 
community association 
our students are placing the accent on the wrong thing the 
gold here and the gold there the right shoes the right dress we 
want the emphasis to be on education ward said 
erskine tillery a 16yearold sophomore with two gold caps on 
his front teeth said he would follow the order for a more 
practical reason hell be safer from gold thieves 
people will shoot you if they dont come out he said

two female helicopter pilots rushing us 
troops to attack zones came under heavy fire during the panamanian 
invasion the pilots said thursday providing new evidence of the 
exposure of army women to combat during the operation 
one pilots helicopter had to be grounded after it was hit 
at night when you see the tracer bullets coming at you you 
realize you could end up giving up your life for your country 
said one of the women army lt lisa kutschera of milwaukee 
the pilots story is a new indication of the combatarea roles 
women played during the attack roles that have sparked 
controversy over what military women should or shouldnt be allowed 
to do in the future 
kutschera along with warrant officer debra mann flew uh60 
blackhawk helicopters trying to evade enemy bullets as they 
ferried infantry troops to several landing zones between midnight 
and dawn of dec 20 
after mann returned from one flight it was discovered that her 
helicopter had been hit by several rounds and damaged badly enough 
to ground it 
wed heard the shots but we didnt even know we had been 
hit she said in an interview by telephone from panama 
the two women along with a third female pilot who also faced 
gunfire during a supply flight the next day have been nominated 
for the air medal 
kutschera and mann also have been nominated to receive the 
additional v designating valor device on the medal for 
particular courage they would be the first women to get the v 
us law bars the navy and air force from placing women in 
combat roles the army attempts to follow the law with its policy 
of combat exclusion that prevents women from being assigned 
jobs directly related to combat as the army defines it that is 
seeking out and engaging the enemy 
since kutschera and mann were ferrying troops in and out of 
battle zones by helicopter and not piloting attack helicopters 
they were correctly deployed said army spokeswoman paige 
eversole 
the issue of womens roles in panama first gained attention with 
reports that army capt linda bray led male and female troops who 
exchanged fire with panamanian defense forces at a kennel for 
police dogs 
in light of reports such as brays rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo has called for legislation directing the army to conduct 
research on lifting the combat restrictions against women 
earlier thursday the head of the us southern command 
headquartered in panama said the united states should not change 
its policy 
the routine carrying of a 120pound rucksack day in and day 
out on the nexus of battle between infantrymen is that which is to 
be avoided and thats what the current army policy does gen 
mr thurman told the senate armed services committee 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate panel noted that 
some women may be capable of carrying the backpack 
it works well just like it is thurman responded 
gen h norman schwarzkopf head of the us central command 
said most in the military would say wed probably lose some 
fighting ability if 50 percent of all infantry units consist of 
females 
the commander of the female helicopter pilots capt thomas muir 
himself shot in the head during one of the operations in which 
kutschera was flying said im quite proud of them they took a 
tremendous amount of fire there were some very hot lz landing 
zones 
muir said he and his unit were on a threemonth rotation from a 
fort ord calif aviation regiment when the us operation 
designed to oust panamas gen manuel antonio noriega began 
the third chopper pilot warrant officer caryl newberry is 
permanently assigned to a regiment in panama she came under small 
arms fire while flying a helicopter on a supply mission on dec 21 
ms eversole said 
the men in the womens units are also being recommended for air 
medals the two women said in the interview 
muir said kutschera took part in three out of four operations 
during the first day of the invasion during the initial nighttime 
assault the pilots used the armys hightech night vision goggles 
to help maneuver as they picked up about 20 soldiers each and 
landed to put them into position for specific attacks he said 
during the first nightime movement of troops from howard air 
force base to the landing zone at fort amador the helicopters 
suffered heavy antiaircraft fire and small arms fire from 
panamanian units muir said 
the unit drew quite a bit of small arms hits during a 
second operation along the coastline during which miss manns 
chopper was hit he said 
during flights in and out of tinajitas northeast of panama 
city later during the day where the unit was ferrying another 
battalion we drew extensive number of hits the fire was quite 
heavy muir said it seems the pdf was ready for us 
at that point muir said he suffered a hit to the head by an 
ak47 round it ended the day for me he joked 
besides himself another soldier was wounded during that segment 
of the operation the captain said the panamanians were using 
machine guns and rifles primarily ak47s when the choppers 
approached he said 
kutschera who was navigating in the lead chopper for the 
tinajitas movement said she knew the group was taking a lot of 
fire despite wearing the earplugs and helmet worn by chopper crews 
she said the reality of the danger of the mission sunk in when 
shed heard over the radio that muir and a gunner on another 
craft had been hit 
it really was combat flying into tinajitas after id 
heard capt muird been shot in the head i thought people could 
die doing this that was probably the scariest point for me she 
said 
i guess it takes a special kind of courage she said of the 
effort 
but both mann and kutschera said they would both gladly do it 
again if they had to 
i was doing what i was trained for said mann 25 of 
seattle 
was she frightened 
it was in the back of my mind wed known at one point that an 
aircraft had been shot down i was a little apprehensive 
kutschera said shed given the matter some thought before 
enlisting 
its my job before i got in i resolved that some day i might 
have to go into combat regardless of the combat exclusion rules 
kutschera said 
but getting shot at that definitely increases your 
attention she said

portauprince haiti ap haitis military government 
published on thursday an electoral law written by an independent 
panel one day after declaring a general amnesty and freeing 19 
political prisoners 
it includes all rules on balloting such as the number of 
polling stations to be set up who will staff them and where ballot 
boxes will be brought for the final tally under the constitution 
the electoral council has complete control over the voting process 
the ninemember electoral council appointed by such 
institutions as the roman catholic church labor unions and human 
rights groups has scheduled presidential elections for oct 28 
local elections are to be held april 29 and legislative elections 
on july 22 
a statement from the information ministry said lt gen prosper 
avrils government published the complete text that the members 
of the independent electoral council submitted to the executive 
most major politicians swore to boycott elections held under 
avril after a crackdown last month in which seven prominent leaders 
were exiled and more than 50 activists were arrested and allegedly 
beaten

dictator jeanclaude duvaliers flight into exile avril promised 
not to interfere in the electoral process and urged haitians to 
respect the rules of the democratic game

leaders could return most said they wont arguing that free 
elections are not possible under avril

the sanctions congress imposed against south 
africa in 1986 took a stiff economic and psychological toll on the 
white government and helped encourage reforms a wide spectrum of 
experts say 
international trade sanctions alone have probably resulted in 
a 2 billion loss annually to the south african economy said 
stephen r lewis jr author of the economics of apartheid 
but lewis president of carlton college in northfield minn 
said us sanctions probably had a greater psychological than 
quantitative impact on south africa because washington never played 
a dominant role in the countrys economy 
fewer than 1 percent of all south africans are employed by 
american companies 
as a result of sanctions however the south african government 
could no longer kid itself the united states would come down on 
its side lewis said 
congress he said sent a message that us opposition to 
apartheid was broadbased not simply a domestic political issue 
driven by the black community 
still the us sanctions combined with an international oil 
boycott other countries restrictions and the inefficiencies of 
apartheid have devastated the economy of south africa a country 
rich in gold and minerals several scholars said 
south africas economy has grown at less than 2 percent in 
recent years compared with about 5 percent between 19501970 
lewis said there is high black unemployment a 20 billion 
external debt and a loss of business confidence 
i think sanctions were quite important said pauline baker 
of the carnegie endowment for international peace a think tank 
they finally made an impact on whites the economy was in 
irreversible decline 
michael johns an analyst at the heritage foundation a 
conservative think tank agreed that sanctions have had a negative 
effect on south africa at this point there has been a 
realization sanctions played a role and increased the pressure 
on south africa 
as important as sanctions in influencing south africa johns 
said were the winds of change blowing through eastern europe 
and other parts of the world conservatives were generally against 
sanctions 
rep dan burton rind a longtime opponent of sanctions 
agreed that they hurt the government but he said he opposed them 
because i have felt for some time the people who suffered most 
were the blacks 
he said positive change could have been brought about just as 
rapidly through creating educational health and jobs programs 
for blacks 
the reagan administration along with thenvice president george 
bush opposed sanctions but assistant secretary of state herman j 
cohen said last year that sanctions have had a positive effect 
according to a paper on sanctions prepared by the house foreign 
affairs committee 
among other things us sanctions barred new us investment 
including bank loans to the south african government prohibited 
the import of south african iron steel coal and uranium and 
agricultural products including sugar prevented the united states 
from exporting computers to south africa banned all nuclear trade 
and halted landings by south african airways 
in general sanctions have helped persuade whites inside the 
country they cant conduct business as usual said steven davis 
a senior analyst at the investor responsibility research center a 
group that monitors activity in south africa 
davis said the number of american companies doing business in 
south africa is about 123 down from a onetime high of 300 
a top administration official said wednesday that south africa 
is likely to make enough progress in easing oppression against 
blacks over the next year to permit lifting of us sanctions 
but despite south african president fw de klerks recent 
loosening of some apartheid regulations several members of 
congress said it would be premature to repeal sanctions because not 
all conditions for their removal have been met 
this is a time when the united states can do the most good by 
waiting and watching said sen richard lugar rind 
as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in 1986 
lugar supported sanctions against south africa leading the drive 
to override president reagans veto of the comprehensive 
antiapartheid act 
apartheid remains intact despite de klerks steps several 
lawmakers said 
de klerk legalized the african national congress after three 
decades of guerrilla war against white rule and said he would soon 
free nelson mandela the anc leader mprisoned in 1962 
de klerks actions important as they are do not meet all the 
conditions required to build the appropriate prenegotiations 
climate said rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house 
africa subcommittee 
nor to they meet the conditions set down in us law required 
to lift the american sanctions he said 
wolpes committee along with a house banking subcommittee will 
hold hearings later this month on legislation that would prohibit 
banks from rescheduling any debt held by south africa 
the sanctions dictate that de klerk release all political 
prisoners end the state of emergency completely and allow all 
political parties to operate 
president bush said he wants to review us policy toward south 
africa including the sanctions

the leading opposition presidential 
candidate violeta barrios de chamorro on thursday picked up the 
support of a coalition of independent indians from nicaraguas 
caribbean coast 
leaders of yatama a federation of miskito sumo and rama 
indians whose eightyear guerrilla war with the leftist sandinista 
government ended last year shifted their support from social 
christian candidate eric ramirez less than three weeks before the 
balloting 
mrs chamorro who is challenging president daniel ortega of the 
ruling sandinistas signed a pact with the indians calling for 
local autonomy ethnodevelopment and reconstruction of 
communities devastated by sandinista repression and natural 
disasters 
hurricane joan flattened much of bluefields a coastal town in 
the region in october 1988 
mrs chamorro said she will make a campaign trip to bluefields 
and puerto cabezas another major town on the coast next week 
were going to win this area she declared 
the ethnic vote in the large but sparsely populated caribbean 
coast represents about 80000 people on a nationwide roll of 17 
million but it has strong symbolic value because of the indians 
fierce independence 
the indians rebelled against the sandinistas in 1981 seeking to 
protect a measure of autonomy against government attempts to impose 
a leftist system 
the strife led to mass relocations of indians and a guerrilla 
war in which the indians like the contra rebel movement in central 
and western nicaragua received us support the indians agreed to 
lay down their arms last year 
mrs chamorro who is more conservative than ramirez represents 
a coalition of 14 opposition parties and the support will 
strengthen her challenge to ortega in the feb 25 election 
clearly stung ramirez suggested financing had something to 
do with the yatama desertion and said he had had no disagreements 
with the indian leadership he did not elaborate 
ramirez considered a moderate said he did not expect voters to 
follow the endorsement 
it doesnt change the political picture in nicaragua he 
insisted in an interview everybody already knows who they are 
going to vote for its too late 
mrs chamorro ortega ramirez and seven other contenders square 
off in the general election 
yatama leader brooklyn rivera admitted indian voters will now 
have to split their tickets between mrs chamorro at the top and 
local candidates running under the social christian banner further 
down the ticket 
well be going house to house community to community he 
said 
rivera said yatama had decided to back mrs chamorro because she 
is sympathetic to the concerns of the underdeveloped isolated 
coast and because shes going to win 
the people of the coast demand something better a change 
freedom and democracy rivera said 
he denied any rupture with ramirez saying their alliance had 
not been formal 
the coast region which represents more than half of nicaraguas 
territory holds economic and strategic importance soviet bloc 
arms shipments and supplies arrive at its ports and the area is 
considered vital to national security 
former president jimmy carter who will be an observer in the 
election personally brokered the agreement between rivera and the 
sandinistas that led to riveras return to nicaragua late last year 
the agreement ended a ban on rivera organizing indigenous 
political groups

the oil spill threatening 
californias coast pales in comparison with the offshore oil well 
blowout that fouled santa barbara beaches in 1969 and helped create 
the environmental movement 
crews toiled thursday to clean up more than 290000 gallons of 
oil that hovered off the southern california city of huntington 
beach after being spilled wednesday by the tanker american trader 
estimates go as high as 325 million gallons for the spill jan 
28 1969 that resulted from failure of a well casing on a union 
oil co of california platform 5 miles off santa barbara 
perhaps more significant industry experts and environmentalists 
alike have said public concern for the environment was focused by 
nationally televised scenes of birds and beaches drenched with 
sticky black goo the spill spurred an eightyear drilling 
moratorium off santa barbara 
the blowout spewed more than 325 million gallons of oil over 
800 square miles of water covered 100 miles of coastline and 
beaches with a thick tarry black goo smothered thousands of 
birds fish and other sea life and helped trigger a new age of 
environmental awareness the california coastal commission said 
on the spills 20th anniversary 
even two decades after the santa barbara spill union oil now 
renamed unocal corp claimed that at most 840000 gallons 
spilled but the western states petroleum association has said at 
least 21 million gallons spilled 
the spill killed at least 9000 birds 88 million barnacles 
30000 mussels and 51800 limpets but harm to the fishing industry 
wasnt proved according to tallies by biologist michael neushul of 
the university of california santa barbara 
unocal which ended up paying about 16 million to settle 
spillrelated lawsuits has argued the spill wasnt an ecological 
disaster and that it spurred improvements in drilling technology 
and training of workers on drilling platforms 
environmentalists contend oil still leaks from the spill site 
but unocal blames natural oil seepage from the ocean floor

in its latest effort to halt rioting in the 
occupied territories the israeli army has introduced a 
jeepmounted gravel thrower that spews out 600 eggsized rocks a 
minute israel radio said thursday 
it is the latest addition to the armys growing antiuprising 
arsenal that includes tear gas and rubber plastic and metal 
bullets 
israel has drawn international criticism for firing guns at 
stonethrowers most of them children and teenagers but army 
officials say troops use live ammunition only when their lives are 
in danger 
also on thursday a military source said the army will increase 
bail for palestinian stonethrowers under the age of 15 from 750 
to 2500 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said the money 
will be returned with interest if the child does not repeat the 
offense within one year of his arrest 
the average palestinian worker earns 300 to 400 a month 
arab reports said meanwhile that a 20yearold palestinian 
salman mardi el madani from the gaza strip village of bani suheila 
died thursday of bullet wounds suffered in a clash with troops a 
day earlier the army confirmed the death but said the 
circumstances were under investigation 
the death brought to 654 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis in the 26monthold uprising against israeli rule of the 
west bank and gaza strip at least 181 palestinians were killed by 
fellow arabs most on suspicion of cooperating with israel 
fortythree israelis have died in the violence 
in the gaza strip refugee camp of rafah on the egyptian border 
riots raged for a second day and at least eight palestinians were 
wounded by soldiers arab reports said 
the protests began wednesday night after soldiers killed an 
18yearold camp activist 
protesters chanted slogans supporting a terrorist raid on a bus 
in egypt that killed nine israeli tourists sunday israel radio 
said the driver of the assailants car lived in the camp before 
emigrating to egypt 10 years ago 
israel radio said protests shouted the bus casualty toll and 
remember what we did to you 
an army official refused comment thursday on reports on the 
gravel thrower 
the radio said it was first used in the west bank town of 
ramallah this week 
the batterypowered device weighs 66 pounds can be mounted on a 
jeep and operated by one soldier it can throw the eggsized stones 
75 yards the report said previous gravel throwers used by the 
army were much heavier and less mobile 
the commander of the west bank maj gen yitzhak mordechai 
told the national itim news agency that as far as palestinians 
throwing stones was concerned the solutions will be high bail 
arrests and the sealing of the homes of stonethrowers 
the military source said the maximum sentence for throwing 
stones and damaging a vehicle is 20 years in prison for 
palestinians above the age of 15 the sentence can be higher if 
someone is injured 
in political developments the palestine liberation organization 
reportedly gave the united states a list of 13 candidates for a 
palestinian delegation to hold preliminary peace talks with israel 
in cairo 
the list as published by the israeli newspaper maariv is 
dominated by backers of plo chief yasser arafat it also contains 
two palestinians from israeliannexed arab east jerusalem and two 
palestinians deported by israel 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the rightwing likud 
bloc opposes palestinians from east jerusalem and deportees as 
negotiators but he has not ruled out a compromise 
palestinian journalist daoud kuttab discounted the list saying 
that if the plo was to issue a list i doubt that an israeli 
paper would be the first place where the names would appear

we exchange opinions here and are summing them up in a difficult 
debate and sometimes this injures our pride sharp words sound in 
this hall but in the end we arrive at the main and i think 
progressive conclusion we should consolidate actions on the basis 
of this conclusion 
the debate has been held the decision has been made the 
program has been endorsed there are guidelines for action we must 
act instead of recollecting who said what and who this concerns 
and we have people inclined to this 
we cannot get used to the fact that a normal process of debates 
is on that pluralism of opinions is not dissent but democratic 
centralism understood in a new way 
open debates are held on vital questions of perestroika when 
the destiny of the country and taking into account its importance 
the destiny of the whole world is being decided 
is there any room for trying to please one another and for 
sparing ones pride 
all this is gone not to be returned there is no need to try to 
guess if this person can be dealt with and the other one cannot we 
should all be together should feel each others support and act 
together we should not start breaking up into clans and groups 
this is the road to destroying the party and the country 
i wish to mention a debate among politburo members that broke 
out here 
meeting miners i told them the truth that there are no 
differences that would interfere with effective functioning of the 
politburo 
it is understandable that there is conflict of opinions that 
debates become more acute i met miners from all over the country 
and received a wealth of information from them 
we get meetings discuss documents compare them there are 
acute conversations 
i would like to say comrade malkov that nobody should think 
that the politburo has split that things are bad this is not the 
case and we should be striving that this should not be so we 
undergo such trial now in the central committee in the politburo 
in the whole of the party and we should be up to the mark 
i liked very much what comrade alexeyev said he is a lawyer 
and he also has a philosophical approach a combination of these 
qualities streamlined thinking and scope is always effective i 
have already said this describing him thus when we nominated him 
to the post of chairman of the constitutional compliance committee 
i liked what sergei sergeyevich said we are at the crucial 
stage are involved in such events that we can hardly assess in 
full what we are doing and what consequences this will have 
our drama is that a load of current problems and acute 
socioeconomic are pressing hard on us 
we overlooked many things and exacerbated the situation this is 
true but this should not lead us to confusion 
we should have scope from which to approach this process a turn 
is being made toward world civilization renewal processes take 
place in the socialist world we must get the bearing in many 
things as comrade shatalin noted we are placing correct 
guidelines for the future but it is important not to err in tactic 
and fall out and surely we should not mix things up 
if we always appraise events from such a vantage point this is 
one kind of approach but if we start to proceed from 
considerations how it affects oneself or what will happen to 
oneself tomorrow this will be another kind of approach 
i have been saying at the politburo all the time 
the question we consider now deserves that we should forget our 
present posts and should not think what happens to us tomorrow for 
the point of the matter is the country and guidelines for its 
development 
we have not yet reached this height there are many people who 
want simple solutions but there are none we are now at a stage 
when there are no simple solutions nor will there be it is 
pardonable in a rankandfile individual unversed in these matters 
when he asks for a clear answer where everything is labeled with 
simple numbers one two three four all populists seek to bank 
on this the ruling party expecially in a country like ours 
cannot embark on this way we must see the world and the country in 
a broad perspective both todays situation and the prospects for 
the future 
i believe we have not erred in the main thing so far but we did 
err in taking required measures in delaying them or failing to 
ensure the synchronization of processes especially in the economic 
reform this has complicated the state of affairs and boomerangs 
politically but this does not mean that we should panic and cry 
help one says you have wrecked a flourishing state another 
something else of the same kind true in another breath they will 
tell you they are not panicmongers and favor perestroika but they 
are panicmongers this is defeatism 
this has been a major plenum with major results but all this 
will only bear fruit if we involve all healthy reformoriented 
forces in the party on the basis of the new party platform and

officials and environmentalists on thursday 
likened the huntington beach oil spill to a rude wakeup call and 
urged lawmakers to pass tough legislation to protect fragile 
shorelines and punish polluters 
once again dumb luck has smiled on california every good 
break we could have gotten we have state controller gray davis 
told a news conference in huntington beach after a helicopter tour 
over the slick off the coast 
wednesdays 295000gallon oil spill from the tanker american 
trader threatened miles of beaches and estuaries thursday but 
favorable offshore winds held the slick stationary against an 
onshore current a mile out to sea and calm seas eased cleanup 
efforts later however the wind reversed direction 
davis who sits on the california lands commission promised a 
state investigation 
he also said the commission would call on congress to require 
tankers be fitted with double hulls an issue now before congress 
the commission which regulates oil development in state lands 
and waters declared previously unprotected tracts in state waters 
offlimits to new drilling in december 
this serves as a wakeup call lt gov leo mccarthy said at 
the news conference he urged the state assembly to pass pending 
oil spill prevention and liability legislation 
attorney general john van de kamp speaking to reporters on the 
beach a short time later called the spill a very fortuitous 
beneficial warning to state residents and lawmakers 
we need to do something to make sure this doesnt happen 
again said van de kamp a democratic candidate for governor 
a us housesenate conference committee is working on differing 
house and senate bills to produce a measure both chambers can 
approve by the march 24 anniversary of the exxon valdez spill in 
alaskas prince william sound 
davis and mccarthy cited the spill in pushing for passage of a 
state bill that would require tankers be equipped with booms and 
other cleanup equipment 
the bill would establish a 500 million reserve funded by the 
oil industry to clean up spills said ed manning a mccarthy aide 
who wrote the legislation 
davis said oil companies have indicated they are willing to 
contribute a total of 10 million to such a fund 
the bill also would require each company operating tankers in 
state waters to meet a 400 million insurance requirement to pay 
for potential legal costs in the event of a spill manning said 
had the bill been law british petroleum co plc which 
chartered the american trader could have been required to pay an 
estimated 25 million penalty to the state davis said 
a november ballot initiative that would enact similar prevention 
and cleanup measures and prohibit new drilling in california waters 
also was expected to receive a boost from the spill 
some activists said the spill should remind californians and the 
rest of the nation about the hazards of reliance on oil as an 
energy source 
the whole issue is that every gallon of oil we save is one 
less gallon of oil that must be pumped and transported and one less 
gallon that can spill bob hattoy regional director of the 
sierra club of southern california said in huntington beach 
the longer we remain addicted to oil the more we pollute the 
air we breathe warm the globe despoil our landscape and run the 
risk of oil spills sydney butler vice president for 
conservation at the wilderness society said in a statement

snow hit the mountains of the northwest on thursday while rain 
dampened parts of the gulf coast states most of the nation east of 
the rockies enjoyed mild and dry weather 
a storm crossing the northwest and another approaching the 
northern pacific coast brought snow to the mountains in washington 
and oregon rain fell in the northern and central pacific coast 
region 
heavier rainfall totals for the sixhour period ending at 1 pm 
est included 130 inches at crescent city calif and nearly half 
an inch at astoria and north bend in oregon 
parts of montana idaho wyoming and colorado had snow and high 
winds wind gusts reached 55 mph at sheridan wyo and 65 mph 
around wheatland 
the colorado rockies got up to 7 inches of snow overnight 
wednesday and a cold front curving through the southwest brought 
snow to parts of arizona 
elsewhere rain showers developing north of a warm front 
extended from the lower rio grande valley of texas to mississippi 
sunny skies prevailed from southern california to the dakotas 
from the southern plains to the great lakes and over much of the 
east a number of cities reported record high temperatures 
charleston sc 74 flint mich 44 mansfield ohio 47 
peoria ill 63 tulsa okla 76 
subfreezing temperatures were confin and an insurance industry 
group said thursday that a study of 106 former and current state 
insurance commissioners showed about half of them obtained jobs 
with insurance companies after they left office 
the study highlights the short period of time many 
commissioners served and the number of former commissioners who 
immediately moved to the industry after leaving office said 
stephen brobeck executive director of the consumer federation of 
america 
the study was released by the consumer insurance interest group 
and the national association of professional insurance agents 
which said state insurance commissioners should be prohibited from 
working directly or indirectly for the industry for one year after 
leaving office to avoid the reality or appearance of conflict of 
interest 
the survey found that 49 percent of the former commissioners 
worked for insurance companies or provided legal accounting or 
other professional services to the industry after leaving office 
their study is incomplete and does not support that sweeping 
conclusion said earle palmeroy president of the national 
association of insurance commissioners 
theyve made no conclusion that the regulation of individual 
commissioners was affected by their later work for the industry 
said palmeroy the north dakota commissioner 
palmeroy also objected to the groups inclusion of commissioners 
who later worked for law and accounting firms that had insurance 
companies as clients 
insurance commissioners are appointed or elected to state boards 
to regulate insurance rates allocate insurance premium taxes and 
carry out other duties 
this study doesnt contain any evidence of impropriety by 
insurance commissioners noted richard yingling president of the 
national association of professional insurance agents 
but even the potential for the appearance of conflict can 
erode the publics confidence in state regulation of insurance 
he added 
the study tracks the employment patterns of 55 former and 51 
current commissioners from the 50 states and the district of 
columbia who are or have served from 1984 through 1989 
employment information was obtained for 53 of the former 
commissioners twentysix worked for the insurance industry in some 
capacity 13 went to other government positions nine entered other 
industries or practiced noninsurance related law while five 
retired 
the consumer insurance interest group is a coalition of three 
consumer advocacy organizations the consumer federation of 
america public citizen a ralphnader founded group and the 
national insurance consumer organization 
the national association of professional insurance agents is a 
trade associaiton representing 180000 independent insurance agents 
who specialize in home auto and business insurance

prodemocracy reformers from within and outside 
the communist party said thursday the decision to renounce its 
legal claim on power is not enough to end political repression and 
centralized control 
it is necessary to eliminate communist party organizations 
in the army the police the kgb the courts in all the state 
institutions said yuri mityunov a spokesman for a wouldbe 
opposition party the democratic union 
boris n yeltsin who has pressed for greater reform cast the 
only vote against the changes wednesday in the policymaking 
central committee because he said they did not go far enough 
i had grounds to vote against but i think however that the 
platform represents if not a step then a halfstep forward and 
that lessens the tension before the party congress late in 
june he said in his office near the kremlin 
a second party should be formed unless the congress removes 
conservatives from communist party leadership said yeltsin who 
spoke sunday to the largest prodemocracy rally in decades at the 
foot of red square 
several hundred thousand people rallied to demand that the party 
abandon its guaranteed leading role in society 
at the central committee meeting that ended wednesday the party 
did just that approving president mikhail s gorbachevs platform 
of revoking the power monopoly in favor of a multiparty system 
the discussion was very hot yeltsin said the proposals 
were diametrically opposed it was not easy 
mityunov said pressure for reform is moving to the streets and 
cited the growing number of angry crowds across the soviet union 
demanding the ouster of hardline local communist leaders 
party secretaries in volgograd tyumen chernigov and sverdlovsk 
were removed in recent weeks and activists said 6000 people 
gathered in front of the party headquarters in donetsk on wednesday 
with a similar demand 
reformers in saratov plan a rally sunday to demand removal of 
their party leaders 
vremya the main television news program showed a rally in 
donetsk on thursday where people demanded the resignation of 
politburo member yegor k ligachev a leading conservative a 
commentator said most people at the rally supported gorbachev 
the official news agency tass said officials of the baltic 
merchant fleet decided to return more than 200 communist political 
officers on its ships to jobs as mechanics electricians and 
navigators or assign them to shore duty 
yeltsin said the party must reform itself but the current 
strength of conservatives in the central committee to which he 
belongs complicates the task 
he declined to say what percent of the vote he thought the 
communist party would win if there were free elections now 
the transition to a multiparty system is just a question of 
time he said it is inevitable and necessary we should use 
all chances still to renew the party so that it will have a 
democratic basis we should try this chance 
the party congress will vote on the party platform and has the 
power to change the central committee 
yeltsin said the platform which has yet to be made available to 
the public contained outdated language and failed to endorse 
radical measures he said are needed to undo the economic chaos 
created by seven decades of central planning 
you talk about approving this program how can i do it 
yeltsin asked he said the draft still endorses democratic 
centralism the principle used to justify central planning and 
fails to favor radical measures need to revive the economy 
yeltsin said the central committee rejected his proposal for 
eliminating the bureaucracy as an instrument of power in favor of 
selfmanagement in enterprises and said he believed that a 
marketstyle economy was desirable as long as workers were 
protected in the transition 
gorbachev has often lambasted the party apparat as a force 
blocking perestroika his plan for economic restructuring 
countries such as poland and czechoslovakia that have embraced 
democratic reforms are finding that digging out the apparat is a 
major challenge to economic changes 
yeltsin said he favored creating factions within the party but 
the central committee opposed allowing formal factions to form 
we should try such a thing as factions that could exist in 
this transition period that possibility of discussion and not an 
atmosphere of unanimity and unity that ligachev constantly calls 
for he ligachev calls for unity unity for the sake of an 
idea yeltsin said 
later thursday in an interview with cbstv yeltsin said if 
we cannot feed the people right now if we cannot produce good 
clothing and if we cannot develop our people spiritually it 
doesnt matter what slogans we shout the people will never 
respond 
he also said the time for halfmeasures and compromises is 
over we are sitting on a critical mass a volcano and within a 
certain period of time neither gorbachev nor any other man may be 
able to lead then the people will decide their destiny like the 
people of eastern europe 
it would be nice if its done in a civilized form like 
east germany czechoslovakia bulgaria but what if it happens like 
romania the bloodshed the tragedy

many of the nations lowerincome women 
especially blacks are anemic during pregnancy a condition that 
can lead to premature delivery or death of the fetus the national 
centers for disease control reported thursday 
thirtyeight percent of blacks and 19 percent of whites in the 
third trimester of pregnancy had hemoglobin levels indicating 
anemia in a 1987 survey of lower income women the cdc reported 
during the second trimester 6 percent of white women and 18 
percent of black women were anemic in the first three months of 
pregnancy 4 percent and 13 percent respectively were anemic 
nationwide the cdc said about 5 percent of nonpregnant 
childbearingage women have anemia 
the survey results mean many lowincome women have poor iron 
nutrition both before and during pregnancy the cdc said 
among pregnant women who receive sufficient iron hemoglobin 
levels normally decrease early in pregnancy the increase through 
the third trimester to near prepregnancy levels the 
atlantabased cdc said 
for the women in the lowincome survey the failure to attain 
prepregnancy levels during the third trimester suggests that many 
of these women were iron deficient during pregnancy 
the racial differences may be related to a greater risk for 
iron deficiency in black women the cdc said but the 
explanation for the difference observed in this analysis is 
unclear 
anemia during pregnancy increases a womans risk of premature 
delivery and increases the childs chances of low birth weight and 
fetal death the cdc said 
the cdcs 1987 pregnancy nutrition surveillance system studied 
anemia during pregnancy among more than 68000 lowerincome women 
in 13 states most of them enrolled in the federal women infants 
and children food program

britains boy scouts said thursday they have 
decided to break their 83year tradition and admit girls who 
sometimes find the activities in the girl guides movement a little 
too tame 
the leader of the guides who count queen elizabeth ii as their 
most famous former member was less than thrilled at the 
announcement and said she hoped the scouts didnt plan to raid her 
organization for members 
the boy scouts of america has allowed girls ages 615 to 
belong to its explorer division for about 19 years according to 
national spokesman lee sneath 
the explorer posts are coed so its not like we have a troop 
of girls and a troop of boys sneath said in dallas theyre 
intermingled and they do exactly the same things 
chief scout garth morrison said in announcing the british 
scouts decision that local scout chapters will be able to choose 
whether to admit girls because some want nothing to do with 
girls nobody would be forced to have them he said 
we are aware that in some places there is a pressing need for 
it and we are anxious to meet that need it is an important move 
and a move in the right direction morrison said 
nicola lowes 14 turned down in october when she and two 
friends applied to join the scout group in wark northern england 
said she would reapply monday 
i was in the guides for a little while but i thought it was 
really boring she said scouts seem more active and you get 
outdoors more 
i was really upset when i was turned down i kept asking them 
why it just wasnt fair 
i think the boys will be for it they treat us just the same 
as they are 
bob hogarth scout leader of the wark troop said the three 
girls have been campaigning strongly and personally i am in favor 
of it we had discussions with the boys in the troop who are aged 
10 to 15 and they were in favor of it too 
morrison a former navy lieutenant said the scout movement 
would be opened to girls aged six to 15 with the first girl scouts 
probably enrolled in 1991 
older girls were allowed to join britains venture scouts in 
1976 and there are 11000 of them now about a quarter of the 
total membership 
girl guides chief commissioner june patersonbrown said she was 
very angry when she learned of the move the two groups had 
just finished a twoyear joint study on greater cooperation 
i am extremely disappointed she said but added i hope 
we are big enough to say that if the scouts want this its their 
decision it really depends if the scouts target our girls if they 
try to poach our girls then it will make things very difficult 
morrison said girl and boy scouts would have separate tents 
toilets and washing facilities on camping trips with men and 
women leaders 
a scout spokesman said there were 680000 british scouts and a 
lot of pressure had built up by girls eager to join attracted by 
the more adventurous activities 
scouts frequently hike and camp out but guides dont go camping 
as often

authorities hated us district judge 
robert aguilar and considered him an enemy because of his liberal 
rulings his attorney said thursday in the opening shot of his 
obstructionofjustice trial 
but a prosecutor told a us district court jury in opening 
arguments that aguilar who is accused of using his office to do 
favors for convicted felons engaged in an eightyear pattern of 
criminal activity 
aguilar 58 the fourth federal judge indicted in the last 
decade is charged with eight felony counts several of the 
accusations against him are combined in a charge that he used his 
office as a racketeering enterprise to obstruct justice the 
first such charge against a federal judge 
if convicted he could draw up to 55 years in prison and 2 
million in fines 
defense attorney patrick hallinan said aguilars rulings as a 
federal judge in san jose since 1980 had generated consternation 
among prosecutors and caused some law enforcement officers to 
look upon him as an an enemy 
those officers he said included fbi agent thomas carlon the 
architect of this indictment and a man with a distaste for 
judges of a liberal bent 
hallinan also said the government had ignored the disappearance 
of aguilars former legal secretary vera hoff for nearly a decade 
until last year when they kidnapped her and intimidated her into 
testifying 
aguilar is accused of helping mrs hoff remain a fugitive in 
mexico from a tax evasion sentence by advising her and offering 
financial help 
hallinans attempt to say more about carlon was cut off by us 
district judge louis bechtle who told him to save his arguments 
for the end of the trial 
but the theme was picked up again by lawyers for aguilars 
codefendants rudy tham 66 a convicted embezzler who was once a 
powerful teamsters union leader and abe chapman 83 a selfstyled 
exmob gunman with a long prison record who was related to the 
judge by marriage 
the attorneys said carlon and another fbi agent repeatedly 
approached us district judge stanley weigel told him aguilar was 
part of a conspiracy to influence his rulings and tried to get him 
to taperecord his conversations with aguilar 
if there was obstruction of justice it was by these men 
here said defense lawyer doron weinberg pointing to the agents 
sitting alongside the prosecutors 
aguilar is accused of approaching weigel and another fellow 
judge on behalf of tham and ronald cloud an aguilar creditor and 
former law client charged with bank fraud of tipping off chapman 
about wiretaps and fbi surveillance of lying to the fbi and of 
telling one of thams attorneys to lie to a grand jury 
justice department prosecutor ralph martin said in his opening 
statement that aguilar attempted over eight years to interfere with 
the proper functioning of the judicial system 
martin said aguilar approached weigel in thams case and us 
district judge samuel conti in clouds 
at the time martin said tham was seeking a hearing before 
weigel to overturn his embezzlement conviction and cloud was 
awaiting trial before conti on bank fraud charges in the sale of a 
nevada casino 
tham was denied a hearing and cloud was convicted 
martin acknowledged that weigel interpreted aguilars comments 
as mere inquiries that werent improper but the prosecutor said 
aguilar showed his intent to help tham and thereby interfere with 
the administration of justice by giving clandestine advice to 
thams attorneys and boasting of his influence with weigel 
martin also said tham helped one of aguilars brothers get a job 
in clouds case martin said aguilar called conti and said 
cloud was an old man hes from fresno and hes a friend of 
mine conti considered the comment improper and aguilar later 
made secretive efforts to help clouds appeal martin said 
hallinan put different interpretations on some of martins 
allegations 
the defense lawyer said aguilar had merely shared his 
expertise on legal matters without trying to influence other 
judges and that the judge didnt know mrs hoff was a fugitive 
when he contacted her

federal authorities backed away from 
investigating an airline owner accused of contributing to the 
financial failure of a kansas city bank because he had ties to the 
cia a newspaper reported 
farhad azima a native iranian and owner of global international 
airways was the fourthlargest shareholder in indian springs state 
bank of kansas city kan which failed in 1984 the houston post 
reported 
the post said it was told by federal law enforcement sources 
which it did not identify that the fbi did not investigate azimas 
and globals links to indian springs because the cia said azima was 
off limits 
i was told by the fbi that azima had a getoutofjailfree 
card a source in the investigation told the post in a story 
published thursday 
the story is one of a series of post articles suggesting 
possible links between the cia organized crime and the failure of 
22 savings and loans as well as indian springs 
global international based in kansas city mo started in 1978 
shipping cattle to iran the fleet grew to 14 boeing 707 jets 
some federal investigators say global was owned by the cia 
others say it performed contract work for the agency the post said 
a cargo plane that the federal aviation administration said was 
owned by azima was linked in 1986 to secret shipments of american 
military supplies to iran azimas attorney said at the time the 
plane was leased to someone else and azima didnt know how it had 
been used 
global filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1983 it 
owed indian springs state bank about 280000 according to a list 
of about 15 million in globals debts to unsecured creditors 
the banks records indicate global was overdrawn at the bank by 
an average of 150000 a day the post said 
indian springs with about 27 million in deposits failed in 
january 1984 
azima who was a director of the bank and owned nearly 10 
percent of its shares was a defendant in a suit filed by the 
federal deposit insurance corp seeking to recover some of the 
banks losses the suit alleged that fraud and negligence on the 
part of azima as a bank official contributed to the banks 
failure the post reported 
the suit was settled out of court and no criminal charges were 
filed against azima in connection with the failure 
global certainly did contribute to the failure of indian 
springs state bank said michael manning a kansas city lawyer 
hired by the fdic to investigate the banks failure 
asked about globals overdrafts at indians springs azima told 
the post i dont get involved in the details of the operations 
i have no idea about that 
azima who now lives in london told the post in a telephone 
interview he didnt recall global doing any work for the cia then 
said as a matter of policy we dont comment on questions like 
this 
the cia in response to a request from the post under the 
freedom of information act said it could neither confirm nor deny 
that any relationship existed with azima

president bush on thursday defended his tour 
of military bases and tough talk on defense issues at a time of 
dramatic change in moscow saying the timing happened to be 
fortuitous 
the president speaking with reporters aboard air force one as 
he returned from a threeday trip that focused on military 
readiness said he did not believe his message would be seen as 
running counter to this weeks developments in the soviet union 
bush said the message he was seeking to send the soviet union 
was one of stability of reasonablenessearlier the president 
broadcasting from an underground command bunker at strategic air 
command headquarters in omaha the president told the nations 
nuclearbearing forces to take some credit for the movement toward 
more democracy within the soviet union 
bushs talk to men and women of sac wrapped up a threeday trip 
that focused on us military vigilance against what he depicted as 
an ongoing soviet threat a message played out in contrast to 
soviet developments widely seen as encouraging in the west 
as bush was watching war games and giving military speeches 
moscows central committee the soviet communist partys 
policymaking body was concluding a historic meeting at which it 
endorsed president mikhail s gorbachevs call for an end to the 
partys constitutional monopoly on power 
bush made little reference to the soviet developments during his 
trip praising gorbachevs initiatives but saying he didnt want to 
pick winners or losers from afar 
some administration officials privately had suggested that the 
timing of bushs saberrattling tour of military installations 
could have been better 
but the president disputed that notion in his inflight talk 
with reporters 
im not going to miss an opportunity in arms control but 
were going to keep a strong defense 
and i think thats a stabilizing message not a militant 
messsage and thats why i think the timing happened to be 
fortuitous bush added 
the president suggested that by stressing military vigilance 
through the week and not overreacting to the events in moscow i 
hope the message comes through in a balanced way that we are not 
going to suddenly drastically change our course away from a 
reasonable defense program 
he said he wanted western european allies to know that the 
united states is not about abandon them or decouple from its 
defense responsibilities there beyond the troop reductions he has 
already proposed 
as long as im president it wont take place bush said 
in his visit to the sac headquarters in omaha bush who was a 
world war ii bomber pilotput on a leather flight jacket and 
bounded up a ladder into a sleek b1 bomber to try out the 
controls then in his business suit bush joined two dozen 
highranking military officers in the newly refurbished sac command 
post 40 feet beneath the surface of offutt air force base 
as red lights flashed over names of sac installations on a large 
screen at the front of the theaterstyle room bush leaned toward 
the microphone that would carry his voice over sacs primary 
alerting system 
good morning this is the president speaking to you he 
began 
citing a critical need to continue our strategic modernization 
program bush hailed the service people who maintain the nations 
primary line of nuclear defense 
i also want to salute your role in shaping history for the 
historical changes we are seeing in the soviet union are in no 
small part due to the vigilance and sheer hard work of the men and 
women of the strategic air command bush said 
your practice of deterrence has kept the peace and defined 
the basis for positive change in the soviet union he added 
but he continued echoing a theme he has sounded all week we 
still live in a time of uncertainty so as we push for a major new 
arms agreement with the soviets to increase stability we will 
continue to modernize strategic forces 
later bush told a republican fundraising dinner in columbus 
ohio his last stop before heading home that there was a new 
moment of promise in the world 
but he said any defense cuts must be made with a scalpel not 
a meat axe and he predicted bitter defense spending battles 
ahead with the democraticcontrolled congress 
on his proposal to reduce us troops in europe from 305000 now 
to 225000 which was put forward in the vienna convention forces 
negotiations on thursday bush said i am convinced we can do 
this the initial reaction from mr gorbachev has been quite 
positive 
referring to the soviet communist partys central committee 
meeting bush said now weve seen them take the first steps 
toward pluralism multipartyism if you will 
he called the events of the past year unbelievable 
unpredictable change a triumph of democracy from prague to 
panama 
in nebraska sac officials said bushs fourminute transmission 
was carried to 200 installations around the world and beamed to 
war planes in the air and to missile crews at silos in the ground 
sac keeps air force surveillance planes and nucleararmed bombers 
in flight at all times 
bush joked to intercontinental ballistic missile crews to 
remember that the pointy end is up 
on tuesday bush attended a simulated tank invasion at war games 
in californias mojave desert on wednesday he toured the lawrence 
livermore national laboratory near san francisco where the bulk of 
the governments research on the star wars strategic defense 
initiative is being conducted 
bush defended his new budget proposal to increase star wars 
spending by 1 billion and to press with modernizing nuclear 
weapons systems 
bill harlow a white house spokesman said the timing of bushs 
trip had nothing to do with the meeting of the soviet central 
committee and that there was no deliberate attempt on the 
administrations part to send a counterpoint message to moscow on 
the state of eastwest relations 
this trip had been planned for a long time he said

the countrys first allcommunist 
government was sworn in thursday after formerly docile allies and 
other opposition leaders ignored appeals to help run the country 
until elections in may 
as parliament president stanko todorov installed the new 
20member cabinet several hundred people protested outside 
demanding the resignation of the lawmaking body because it approved 
the new government 
premier andrei lukanov told the national assembly the 
economically stagnant country is in deep crisis and he pledged 
to move toward a market economy that favors the equality of all 
property including private and foreign ownership 
his comments broadcast over government radio appeared to 
signal determination to institute some of the same reforms already 
in place by other warsaw pact countries further on the road to 
democracy 
longtime hardline communist party chief todor zhivkov was 
ousted in november but parliament did not abolish the partys 
guaranteed grip on power until jan 15 
the cabinet replaces one that resigned last week and included 
some members of the agrarian party which had been a docile ally of 
the communists for decades 
in the immediate postwar years some other parties later 
absorbed by the communists or banned were also represented in 
governments 
the communists had called for a new government of national 
concord comprising representatives from all social forces in 
this balkan country of about 9 million people 
but the opposition union of democratic forces repeatedly 
rejected the communists offer to participate and the agrarian 
party announced wednesday that it also would refuse to be part of a 
communistdominated cabinet 
opposition representatives said they did not want to be in the 
cabinet because 67 percent of parliamentary deputies are 
communists they alleged this would substantially slow reforms 
parliament unanimously elected lukanov premier saturday after 
premier georgi atanasov and his cabinet resigned atanasov a 
holdover from the era of ousted communist leader todor zhivkov had 
been accused of economic mismanagement 
the new government will run the country until multiparty 
elections are held may 5 
until the elections this government will serve national 
interests not party interests lukanov told parliament 
it faces a difficult task bulgarias foreign debt tops 10 
billion labor productivity is low and private initiative has been 
stifled by more than four decades of a system of rigid central 
planning that also ruined agriculture 
in addition the alternative socialist alliance a group of 
reform rebels inside the communist party plans to break away at a 
special congress feb11 
lukanov was unable to fill two of the 22 cabinet posts the 
environment ministry and the culture ministry 
he said he would have liked petar beron a senior opposition 
figure and member of the ecoglasnost environmentalist group to be 
the minister of the environment but berons association with the 
united democratic front made it impossible for him to join the 
cabinet 
asked what kind of government he had hoped to form originally 
lukanov said he thought half the ministers would be communists 
while the other half would be members of the united democratic 
front the agrarian party and independents 
in his speech to parliament lukanov pledged maximum support 
in the form of government subsidies and loans to agricultural 
producers who bring in the highest yield whether they are paid by 
the government or farm their own small plots 
his comments were seen as a signal that the state was 
considering ending decades of strict restriction on how much land 
an individual could work privately 
lukanov announced the bulgaria planned to seek membership in the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the world body of free 
trade the international monetary fund and the world bank in a 
clear effort to improve the countrys moribund trade and debt 
picture 
he also asked foreign creditors for trust and patience

a medvedev told a news conference at londons royal institute for 
international affairs we now have the possibility of controlling

a forest fire raged out of control 
through a wildlife reserve for rare animals in southestern brazil 
on thursday and killed some of the reserves 250 nearextinct 
golden lion marmosets officials said 
fire that began saturday has destroyed more than half of the 
poco das antas wildlife reserve 80 miles northeast of rio said 
vicente moreira conti a spokesman for ibama brazils 
environmental protection agency 
more than 400 firefighters police and biologists struggled to 
put out the blaze and save the animals 
conti said the fire was burning in five areas of the 12300acre 
reserve the last remaining stronghold for the marmoset and a 
sanctuary for rare sloths alligators monkeys and jaguars 
the fire has severely burned areas where tamarin families were 
living we fear some have died conti said in a phone interview 
tamarin is another name for the marmoset a monkey the size of a 
cat with a lionlike mane and a bushy tail 
conti said droves of animals were fleeing the area but only 
small numbers of the marmosets had left the reserve biologists 
were losing contact with the marmosets monitored by means of tiny 
radio transmitters tied around their necks he said 
environmentalists are concerned the fire may kill all of the 
shy little beasts because they hide in tree holes for warmth and 
shelter 
conti said firefighters were clearing quartermile strips of 
forest to slow the spread of the fire 
but the firefighters were hampered by the 100degree 
temperatures of the southern hemisphere summer high wind 
difficult access to the mountainous area and a lack of water caused 
by a long dry spell he said 
a twinengined dromader plane was to arrive on friday from 
southern brazil to drop 21000 gallons of water on critical areas 
the equivalent of a months rainfall in the region he said 
conti added its our last hope were trying to soak the soil 
and foilage to halt the spread of the fire 
but he said it would take several days of heavy rain to 
extinguish the fire and no rain was forecast before next week 
manchete tv showed helicopters airlifting firefighters to 
burning areas and crews battling flames with portable water tanks 
and rubber mats 
ibama president fernando mesquita promised more firefighters and 
said environmental specialists from northeastern brazil will arrive 
friday to help 
the cause of the fire was not known but officials said 
unusually dry weather and summer heat could have caused the fire to 
begin spontaneously 
poco das antas which in portuguese means watering hole of the 
tapirs had become the center of an international crusade to 
protect the environment 
the reserve was founded in 1974 and funded by the smithsonian 
institution in washington the world wildlife fund and the 
brazilian and canadian governments 
the smithsonian said in washington that two of its employees in 
the reserve suffered minor injuries fighting the fire and that 
acting associate director ben beck will leave sunday to assess the 
damage 
the marmoset was pushed to edge of extinction in 1972 when just 
70 remained on earth after poachers hunters and ranchers trapped 
them and cut down their forest habitats 
but the animal slowly had been reproducing after naturalists 
released them in groups from foreign zoos into the brazilian forest

scientists have identified a 
120millionyearold fossil barely an inch tall as the worlds 
first known flower 
the two yale university researchers who announced the discovery 
thursday offered the fossil as evidence that flowering plants had a 
more humble beginning than was previously thought 
scientists have long believed that the ancestors of todays 
flowering plants were magnolialike shrubs and trees with large 
showy flowers 
but leo j hickey a geologist and david w taylor a 
biologist advance a new theory of plant evolution in this weeks 
issue of the journal science which argues that the earliest flowers 
were impressive neither in size nor color 
the new theory may help provide an explanation for what darwin 
called the abominable mystery behind the relatively sudden 
evolutionary appearance of large flowering plants the scientists 
said 
darwin was mystified by the apparent lack of any obvious 
ancestors to the plants 
the fossil that hickey and taylor identified as a tiny flowering 
plant from the middle age of the dinosaur was unearthed about 10 
years ago in southeastern australia and belongs to the national 
museum of victoria in melbourne 
the fossil had originally been labeled a fern or nonflowering 
plant 
taylor said he and hickey were working on a new theory of the 
ancestry of flowering plants when he came across a publication in 
1988 which featured a picture of the fern i said ah ha 
that looks like tiny flowers he recalled 
using highresolution photography the scientists were able to 
confirm that the fossil was a portion of a branch from an 
angiosperm a class of plant in which the seeds are enclosed in an 
ovary 
the flowers on the plant are less than a tenth of an inch long 
and are made up of a modified type of leaf with berries attached 
the scientists said the coloring was believed to be brown or 
greenish 
they said the specimen probably came from a mature plant 6 to 12 
inches in height and resembling todays black pepper plant 
the discovery means scientists have been barking up the wrong 
tree in their search for the earliest flowers because it is not a 
tree at all hickey said 
fossils of bird feathers insects and conifers were also 
uncovered at the site where the plant was found the yale 
researchers said the absence of wood remains from large flowering 
plants supported their hypothesis 
scientists have found pollen apparently from plants that existed 
130 million years ago but have yet to uncovered any actual remains 
of flowers from that period 
until their discovery the yale scientists said the earliest 
known flowers were specimens believed to be close to 115 million 
years old 
peter crane an authority on early flowering plants from the 
field museum of natural history in chicago called the discovery of 
the 120millionyearold plant exciting and said he was 
fundamentally in sympathy with the theory advanced by the yale 
scientists 
but he said a lot of other data has to be counted for and 
that exactly what the first flowers looked like is still up for 
grabs

the food and drug administration has won white 
house approval of stricter regulations about health claims by food 
marketers permitting only truthful and not misleading 
assertions about a narrow range of diseases an agency official 
said thursday 
such claims used to be completely banned but the agency began 
allowing them under a new policy announced in 1987 some members of 
congress have said fda was allowing manufacturers to play 
reckless games in making illfounded claims 
the policy revision to be published in the federal register 
next week is a midcourse correction said the official who 
discussed the draft on condition that he not be identified 
though advertising might come under the policy the agency is 
most concerned with what is carried on the package label he said 
the office of management and budget which reviews draft 
regulations of all executive branch agencies approved the policy 
on wednesday without requesting substantial changes the official 
said 
the new policy will allow health claims only about these topics 
fiber and colon cancer 
fiber and heart disease 
fats and cancer 
fats and heart disease 
sodium and high blood pressure 
calcium and osteoporosis a softening of the bones sometimes 
found in the elderly 
many scientists believe that in some circumstances fiber might 
reduce colon cancer and heart disease fats might increase cancer 
and heart disease high concentrations of sodium increase blood 
pressure and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis 
the new policy will require that any claims be 
truthful and not misleading in the officials words 
limited to describing the relationship between a particular 
food component and a chronic disease 
consistent with a reasonable diet 
supported by fdaapproved summaries of the evidence the agency 
will make available model summaries for industry to use 
until final adoption of the new policy which could take a year 
the agency will enforce it case by case considering whether 
the scientific evidence supports a claim 
there are enough benefits to make a claim in the first place 
whether the good outweighs the bad in following the 
sellers advice the official said this point might for example 
rule out a lowcholesterol food that is high in saturated fats 
since scientists believe saturated fats in the diet are more 
important in forming cholesterol in the blood than diet cholesterol 
itself 
he declined to give examples of current claims the agency could 
act against under the new policy 
however the agency has said it has serious concerns about 
cereals containing husks of psyllium which contain soluble fiber 
fda also has warned the american heart association against its 
new heartguide program to label brands it approves as heart 
healthy with a prominent mark 
the official said the new policy did not directly bear on the 
heart groups action he said he understood the association had 
said it would review the program plans when the new policy was 
published

hundreds of grenades and other 
explosives soviet troops were to destroy in a controlled operation 
went off all at once shattering windows at a nearby village the 
official ctk news agency said wednesday 
a gross violation of safety regulations caused the blast at 
the libava base on tuesday that left the area 180 miles east of 
prague blanketed with red dust ctk quoted defense ministry 
spokesman stanislav pohoral as saying 
no one was injured pohoral said 
the troops at the weapons arsenal and military exercise area 
were destroying 500 antitank grenades and 44 pounds of gunpowder 
with 26 pounds of tnt ctk said 
according to a military report on the investigation carried by 
ctk the soldiers dug three holes seven yards apart to destroy 
the grenades and the gunpowder 
none of the holes was covered with topsoil and when the first 
cache was detonated the others exploded in a chain reaction the 
report said 
radiation measurements carried out by soviet experts czech 
police and citizens representatives showed no danger for the 
surrounding population ctk said without elaborating on whether 
the depot actually contained nuclear arms 
during this morning soviet military authorities have 
apologized to the concerned citizens and measures were taken to 
eliminate and compensate the damage the investigation into the 
case goes on the ctk report said 
authorities agreed that ammunition would be destroyed in smaller 
quantities in the future the agency said 
it did not say why the load on tuesday had to be destroyed but 
ammunition is often disposed of in a controlled explosion when it 
is found to be old or defective 
the incident occurred as talks on the withdrawal of about 7oooo 
soviet troops from czechoslovakia were to resume this week in 
moscow 
since the democratic revolution in november the czechoslovak 
side has demanded withdrawal of the entire soviet military 
contingent by the end of 199o 
thousands of citizens demanding the pullout demonstrated in 
prague on tuesday accusing soviet military of occupying the 
country since the 1968 invasion that crushed a reform movement

two coast guard ship traffic monitors tested 
positive for alcohol and marijuana use after the exxon valdez oil 
spill but a prosecutor argued thursday that jurors shouldnt hear 
about it 
defense attorneys in the trial of joseph hazelwood the former 
tanker skipper accused of causing the nations worst oil spill 
said such evidence is relevant and could show that blame for the 
disaster lies elsewhere 
the dispute arose just before one of the coast guard employees 
took the stand to tell how he and others watched the exxon valdez 
progress through the valdez narrows and into prince william sound 
the night it ran aground 
the tanker ran onto bligh reef early march 24 spewing more than 
10 million gallons of north slope crude the spill killed thousands 
of birds fish and other wildlife and blackened hundreds of miles 
of shoreline 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemanor charges of 
reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating a 
vessel while intoxicated if convicted he faces up to seven years 
and three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
assistant district attorney brent cole said the drug tests were 
irrelevant because some were administered 15 hours after the 
grounding and others were conducted three days later 
documents filed in the case showed that bruce blandford the 
monitor on duty when the tanker went aground showed a blood 
alcohol level of 203 15 hours later 
cole said blandford went home after the accident and began 
drinking 
there is aboslutely no evidence that mr blandford was under 
the influence of intoxicating liquor at any time during his 
shift said cole conceding that in a later urine test blandford 
also showed a trace of morphine gordon taylor who tracked the 
ship until shortly before it ran aground was tested march 26 and 
showed a small amount of marijuana in his system 
cole said the amount was consistent with being in a room where 
marijauna was being smoked by others or with use far removed from 
the day of testing 
he said there wasnt any evidence taylor was under the influence 
of marijuana at the time of the crash 
cole argued that the tests were irrelevant also because the 
coast guard isnt being accused of negligence in the trial 
this is not a civil negligence case cole told superior 
court judge karl johnstone we have an attempt by the defense to 
turn it into that by trying to spread out the blame 
johnstone refused to admit evidence of the marijuana saying 
defense lawyers had failed to show sufficient reason to explore the 
issue 
he put off a ruling on whether the alcohol evidence regarding 
blandford would be admitted 
johnstone ruled the defense couldnt use a theory of government 
negligence but later said he may reverse himself 
what the defense seems to be saying said johnstone is 
were not reckless we didnt create the problem the government 
created the problem the more i think about it the more i think 
the defense should be able to show they didnt create it the 
government did im reconsidering it 
defense attorneys said the traffic monitors were responsible for 
alerting the exxon valdez crew if they spotted trouble on their 
radar screen 
blandford may well have been under the influence of alcohol 
while on duty at the vessel traffic control center a defense 
motion said his possible intoxication may have been a 
contributing factor in the grounding 
madson said in his opening statement to jurors that there was 
never a warning from the radar station that the 987foot tanker was 
approaching bligh reef and was about to run aground he also said 
he would show that no one was watching the screen at the time of 
the accident 
in testimony thursday shipping agent patricia caples told the 
jury she saw hazelwood moments before the exxon valdez left port 
she said he seemed to be in a good mood and suspected he might 
been drinking only because he seemed so jolly otherwise the agent 
said the captain seemed unchanged from his normal demeanor and was 
very businesslike 
the prosecution contends that hazelwoods alleged drunkeness 
contributed to the accident

heads shoulders knees and toes sculpted by some 
of the worlds greatest artists are on display at the musee 
dorsay illustrating that fragments are often more powerful than 
the whole 
the muscled torso of a man falling over backward the curled 
fingers of a tensed hand and the bloodsoaked head of a 
revolutionary martyr are part of a major retrospective on 
fragmented human forms sculpted over the centuries 
the exhibit titled the body in pieces is here through june 
3 when it travels to frankfurt west germany it is a comprehensive 
look at how artists from michaelangelo to rodin have been 
fascinated with buttocks breasts and biceps heads hands and 
haunches 
some of the works are simply the remnants of things past the 
whole having been lost long ago other works such as rodins study 
of praying hands were conceived as fragments from the start 
fragmenting the human form reinforces our perception of what 
remains wrote ann pingeot in the 343page exhibition catalogue 
the show features hundreds of pieces of sculpture by rodin 
aristide maillol emileantoine bourdelle and photographs drawings 
and even a tree of waxen hands 
a major highlight is lorenzo da mugianos torso of louis xii 
dating from 1508 the hands and head were tacked on from 1798 to 
1790 when scholars believed that broken was not beautiful 
today art critics are delighted that the armless venus de milo 
did not suffer the same fate 
bourdelle a french sculptor wrote in 1937 its so sad to 
think that there are people still searching for the venus de milos 
gesture and who instead of appreciating it as it is if they were 
capable of seeing it want to find out at all cost what action the 
statue represented 
fragments became fashionable in the 20th century as a genre 
reflecting the philosophy that less is more 
michaelangelo was the first to conceive of an incomplete statue 
as a finished work rodin followed in that tradition three 
centuries later and made fragments the cornerstone of his 
composition 
the exhibition features dozens of his works which have long 
been considered as experimental and which are virtually unknown 
to the general public

monsignor sebastian laboas comment sunday that panama had 
passed from one dictatorship to another with the us overthrow 
of manuel antonio noriega was the lead story in the panama city 
newspaper la estrella de panama 
the newspapers majority owners were close associates of noriega 
and backed the general until his ouster dec 20 noriega took 
temporary refuge at the vatican embassy 
on tuesday laboa denied in television interviews having made 
the statement when he spoke with an associated press reporter at 
the panama city airport he did not elaborate 
the denial was carried by other newspapers and radio and tv 
stations one radio station criticized laboa for making the 
allegation and recalled that in january he had defended eliezer 
gaytan noriegas chief bodyguard who remains in the vatican 
embassy 
gaytan has been accused of taking part in assassinations of 
military officers who tried unsuccessfully to overthrow noriega oct 
3 laboa said gaytan could not be blamed because he was only 
obeying orders 
julio harris minister of the presidency said wednesday that 
justice was being applied in the country and that the justice 
system like other branches of government was independent 
this country is today living a really democratic system he 
said 
it is not our fault that the panamanian people in their 
rejection of those who governed them and abused their confidence 
may be seeking justice for many of them while at the same time 
others are relegated to an obscure and anonymous life he said 
laboa in the comments at the airport had said the new 
governments prosecution of former officials in the noriega 
dictatorship for crimes ranging from homicide to robbery and abuse 
of power was craziness 
more than 100 officials of the noriega regime have been arrested 
and the government on radio television and newspaper ads has 
invited the public to file complaints against them 
after eluding invading us troops for four days noriega took 
refuge at the vatican embassy on christmas eve and remained there 
until jan 3 under pressure from church officials to leave he 
turned himself in to us troops

a blitz of the texas border has been 
launched by immigration officials worried about an increase in the 
number of central american illegal aliens the head of the 
immigration and naturalization service announced wednesday 
were not going to allow border crashing said ins 
commissioner gene mcnary outlining plans to spend an additional 
11 million on the crackdown 
six large tents such as those used for revival meetings have 
been erected at the 347acre detention camp near bayview raising 
its capacity to 2500 mcnary said the ins will build tents to hold 
10000 detainees if needed 
the bayview camp held 998 detainees wednesday an additional 632 
central americans were held at five other ins sites in south texas 
when the ins was overwhelmed with more than 500 central 
americans applying for political asylum daily last february the 
agency reduced the time it took to make asylum decisions to just 
one day 
those denied asylum were held in the detention camps pending 
deportation proceedings 
that action reduced the flow of aliens seeking asylum at bayview 
to less than 10 a day and it stayed that way for months 
in october however apprehension of aliens from countries other 
than mexico rose to 829 in the ins sector covering bayview by 
january the figure had risen to 1860 mostly central americans 
said ins spokesman duke austin 
increased tensions in central america and an ins decision to 
release asylumseekers on their own recognizance may have spurred 
the new flow of aliens officials said 
to save money the ins last month decided to lower the camps 
population below 700 and allowed the asylumseekers to travel to 
join relatives elsewhere in the united states while their cases 
progressed 
since that time im convinced that because of the gradual 
increase in people coming across the border that we need to put on 
a blitz mcnary said 
mcnary said the new crackdown is intended to remind central 
americans that those who come to the united states unable to show a 
wellfounded fear of persecution will be denied asylum 
detained and deported 
mcnary refused to say how long the crackdown would last but 
said ins personnel will be shifted from other sectors to help out 
an activist group called the rio grande defense committee 
protested the new ins action 
last year these tents became a symbol of injustice of 
summary asylum denials and coercive illegal conditions of 
confinement the group said in a statement 
several members of the group handed out leaflets protesting the 
ins move during mcnarys visit 
political asylum is granted to those able to show they are 
fleeing a country for political rather than economic reasons

president janez drnovsek on 
wednesday said relations between quarrelsome republics in the 
country have deteriorated to the point where the most radical 
clashes are possible 
the feuds between our republics and peoples have worsened to 
the extreme drnovsek told a joint session of parliament this 
negative process must be stopped as it has reached a dangerous 
point 
he also said the reformist communist leadership will support 
yugoslavias fullscale movement toward the european community 
we expect that the effective implementation of our reforms will 
successfully pave the way to our membership in the ec 
in another turn to the west yugoslavia applied wednesday for 
membership in the council of europe becoming the third eastern 
european country after poland and hungary to seek to join the 
strasbourg francebased advisory body best known for promoting 
human rights and parliamentary democracy 
relations among the five constituent republics of yugoslavias 
fragile federation already strained due to deep rifts between 
conservatives and reformers have taken a sharp turn for the worse 
the past year 
the communist leadership and partisan press in yugoslavias 
largest republic of serbia have lashed out against the liberal 
northern regions of slovenia and croatia accusing them of 
treason for criticizing serbias policies in the ethnically 
troubled kosovo province 
at least 26 people of albanian origin died in clashes with riot 
police during a rash of demonstrations that shook the province last 
week the ethnic albanian majority is demanding an end to a 
yearlong state of emergency and greater autonomy for the province 
which serbia controls 
the two northern republics object to human rights violations 
they allege are being committed by serbian authorities in efforts 
to control the unrest 
in december serbia broke off all official and trade ties with 
slovenia after authorities there banned a rally by serbs seeking to 
oust the slovenian leadership 
unspecified retaliatory measures against croatia the 
secondlargest of yugoslavias five states have also been 
threatened by serbias media 
drnovsek itemized a sevenpoint approach to the solving of the 
kosovo problem including the start of talks because problems 
cannot be solved by force and the lifting of the state of 
emergency as soon as the situation there calms down 
drnovsek also reiterated the presidencys support for the 
sweeping changes instituted by the reformist government of prime 
minister ante markovic 
these include the establishment of a multiparty parliamentary 
system and the transformation of yugoslavias governmentrun 
economy into a free market system

more than 1000 union workers chanting 
save the shipyard rallied wednesday to keep their jobs at the 
long beach naval shipyard targeted for closure by the pentagon 
what were trying to do is get our congressmen and senators to 
understand that this is really a bad move there is no economic 
sense to it no sense from a defense point of view said 
electrical engineer darrell meft 
meft is one of about 4100 shipyard workers most of them union 
members who stand to lose their jobs if congress allows the 
shipyard to close to cut costs at the defense department the 
shipyard is one of 72 military installations slated for closings or 
cutbacks 
in addition to the rally workers from 13 labor unions have been 
preparing leaflets faxing letters to washington and urging 
employees to write and telephone their lawmakers 
the unions argue that the shipyard is one of the most efficient 
in the country with projects last year coming in 20 million under 
budget

laundering money from cocaine sales and a host 
of other criminal activities represents a 300 billion worldwide 
business each year but could prove the drug trades key area of 
vulnerability a senate report said today 
because money laundering is principally accomplished through 
the use of legitimate financial institutions money laundering is 
the potential achilles heel of the illegal drug business said 
the report from two senate panels 
the report released by sen john f kerry dmass was based on 
testimony before the senate foreign relations and banking 
committees last fall 
it attributed to assistant treasury secretary salvatore martoche 
the estimate that worldwide drug revenues total 300 billion 
annually including 110 billion generated in the united states it 
said laundering all of this cash presents tough problems for

this smoky smelly city is 
classified by ecologists as an environmental catastrophe hidden 
until now by the iron curtain the word is out that its pollution 
is killing its people 
with the collapse of the iron curtain across eastern europe 
bitterfeld has become exposed to the outside world deadly chemical 
canals bubble past homes smokestacks spew sickening yellow and 
black toxic emissions above a poisoned wasteland 
the rev peter heyroth a lutheran pastor prays the city about 
75 miles southwest of berlin can be saved 
for years the seriousness of the environmental damage was 
kept secret he said only now are we beginning to find out how 
frightening the situation is 
ecologists call bitterfeld a chemical bomb with a shortened fuse 
one of europes most dangerously polluted cities east germany is 
one of europes most dangerously polluted countries 
its emissions of some toxic substances like forestkilling 
sulphur dioxide exceed those of all other european nations 
scientists say 
about twothirds of east germanys lakes and rivers are believed 
to be badly or moderately contaminated and large parts of its 
forests are dying as well 
west german companies plan to help clean up areas in east 
germany like bitterfeld but the task will cost billions and 
require years to complete 
the bitterfeld area with its huge chemical complexes and 
smokespewing coalfired power plants is a major contributor to 
east germanys ominous ecological woes 
the 60000 people in the greater bitterfeld area live in the 
toxic shadow of two giant stateowned combines the ckb and fkc 
chemicalproducing complexes and several coalburning power plants 
whose emissions include sulphur dioxide 
black coal soot lies in layers on the citys homes and 
businesses 
noxious odors waft from several ponds filled with chemical 
wastes and vast stretches of the areas three rivers are totally 
devoid of life 
on windy days the chemical stench in parts of bitterfeld and 
neighboring wolfen is so bad that people shutter their windows in 
often futile attempts to keep the fumes out 
open coal pits the size of large villages have created a 
wasteland outside the residential areas adding to the toxic 
grimness 
hans zimmermann a local ecologist said liquid chemical wastes 
without the rigid cleansing treatments usual in the west have 
badly contaminated the soil and groundwater 
west german scientists have expressed shock that bitterfeld area 
residents drink the milk of cows that graze on pastureland that 
could be contaminated by toxic substances 
zimmermann said the most frightening thing for him is that no 
one knows for sure what the longterm health dangers might be but 
suspects the wastewater includes highly hazardous dioxins 
oncesecret documents show the chemical wastewaters are also 
laced with sulphates huge amounts of chlorine mercury and other 
highly toxic substances according to the jan 8 issue of the west 
german newsmagazine der spiegel 
bitterfeld has been the site of at least one major chemical 
accident 
in 1968 a huge explosion at ckb killed about 70 people 
zimmermann said 
he added that over the past few years a number of smaller 
accidents have occurred at ckb a major producer of a wide range of 
chemical products including herbicides pesticides and paints but 
information about the accidents was always kept inhouse said 
zimmermann 
area residents suffer from a variety of ailments including lung 
diseases cancer and slow bone development among children experts 
and residents say 
recent western tests found that bitterfelds residents have an 
average life span at least five years shorter than that of other 
east german citizens 
of those people who die early here i bury more who have 
perished from cancer than anything else pastor heyroth said 
in wolfen luisi schmidt points to a giant pond filled with 
liquid chemical wastes next to her home 
signs reading danger lifeendangering do not enter 
surround the pond 
it stinks like the devil here sometimes said ms schmidt 
who looks much older than her 51 years and has sores at her 
hairline and on her face 
a young woman died of cancer not so long ago she added 
she was only 35 it was that stinking cesspool 
zimmermann and heyroth say one of the main problems in 
bitterfeld is that east germanys former stalinist leaders never 
bothered to modernize the chemicalproduction factories and power 
plants 
they also decided it was more important to pursue chemical 
production at a breakneck pace regardless of the possible health 
hazards 
east germanys ecological problems are widespread and there seem 
to be at least two reasons people have tolerated it for so long 
the communists refusal to say exactly what the dangers were and 
the lure of salaries up to three times as high for chemical plant 
workers than for other citizens 
this city has been totally subjugated by these gigantic 
chemical complexes ecologist zimmermann said and in the 
process it has died

in the brave new world of the telephone company 
its no longer enough to listen to computers now you have to talk 
to them 
at the tone please say your name electronic operators are 
telling collect callers around the country the machines then ask 
customers at the other end if theyll pay the charges please say 
yes or no 
the system years in the works and just now arriving marks a 
new tier in telephone technology a computer that not only delivers 
messages or directs callers to hit buttons but responds to the 
human voice 
it understands when you say yes or no said preston peek 
spokesman for northern telecom inc a leading developer of 
computer systems that can discern spoken words it asks what you 
want to do and you just tell it 
and its probably coming to a phone company near you 
three of the seven regional phone companies ameritech 
bellsouth and nynex have voice recognition systems for 
collect and thirdparty calls in some areas now two more pacific 
telesis and bell atlantic will soon 
the phone companies eyeing lower costs and a bigger market 
love the technology they say even smarter computer systems ones 
that can make out numbers even city names are near 
its inevitable that everyones going to go to computerized 
voices said atampt spokesman bryant steele its costsaving 
its more efficient 
but that delight is not universally shared 
after some initial grousing people will eventually go ahead 
and live with it said dr kenyon degreene an expert in 
humanmachine relationships however a price eventually has to 
be paid 
that price said degreene a psychologist and professor of 
systems management at the university of southern california is the 
burgeoning impersonality of society 
when a computer demands specific words from a telephone caller 
control seems to rest with the machine degreene said and because 
many people dont understand the workings of technology theres 
an implied threat there 
the person senses that he cannot use freeflowing speech hes 
being constrained the computer is controlling him it can be 
simply frustrating he said people adapt to it but only by 
filing it away subconsciously as another annoyance of living in our 
technological world 
there are other problems because of interference background 
noise or other glitches the computers do not always recognize 
words they eventually switch to a human operator but only after 
several tries for now they recognize only english and callers 
once familiar with the system still have to listen to the 
computers spiel before answering 
there is an out however callers can ignore the computers 
instructions and just hit o to get a human operator 
if speaking to a computer is annoying its also fascinating 
for its first trick asking the collect callers name the system 
simply records the answer and plays it back to the call recipient 
after announcing the call is collect 
the next part is harder after asking if the recipient will 
accept the call the system compares the yes or no response 
to a soundwave matrix based on recordings of tens of thousands of 
people uttering those words 
it makes its best guess as to whether you said yes or 
no said candice kamm a specialist in speech recognition at 
bell comunications research inc in livingston nj 
the computer guesses right about 98 percent of the time she 
said provided the person does what theyre supposed to do 
she predicts customers will adjust noting that phone users grew 
accustomed to answering machines and later to the computerized 
voices providing numbers to directory assistance callers 
michigan bell gave the northern telecom system its first tryout 
starting in june in grand rapids now its expanding computerized 
operators to detroit pontiac and then across the state the system 
is newly arrived in florida ohio and new york 
nationally us telephone callers placed 579 million collect 
and thirdparty calls in 1988 
multiply that by the amount of seconds each operator spends 
handling one of those calls and youll get an idea of the 
savings said peek the northern telecom spokesman 
further savings are ahead half the nations telephones are 
rotary rather than touchtone models and those callers cannot 
punch in credit card numbers but when the computers can recognize 
spoken numbers operators wont be needed to handle those 
creditcard calls 
rotary phones also will become compatible with systems that now 
require touchtone responses to reach an extension for example 
or to hear a recorded train schedule 
and when the systems can understand city names directory 
assistance callers will find themselves queried for that 
information by the computer before an operator completes the 
service again cutting operator time 
us sprint the nations no 3 longdistance phone company says 
by june it will start a voiceactivated dialing system in which 
callers can say their names and a password instead of punching in 
their account codes callers also will be able to dial 
preregistered numbers with spoken orders such as call home 
sprints longdistance competitors atampt and mci communications 
corp are studying voiceactivated services atampt has said some 
services could begin this year mci has no such plans now 
two of the regional phone companies us west and southwestern 
bell have no immediate plans to implement voiceactivated 
services but theyre looking into it we consider its better 
customer service to have live operators said us west spokesman 
stephen holder and we dont believe the technology performs well 
enough yet 
spokesmen for michigan bell and new york telephone co reported 
few customer complaints and said they were not laying off 
operators but they said the savings should enable them to handle 
increasing demand without hiring more workers new england 
telephone which is starting the service this month said it might 
reduce some operators hours 
linda meltzer a phone company analyst for drexel burnham 
lambert predicted layoffs down the line saying theyll need 
less employees as they become automated 
companies will push technology whenever they can as long as 
theres an economic advantage to it said degreene the usc 
professor 
while staff reductions save money for a company it 
precipitates all kinds of social problems he said it puts the 
companys problem out into society in general what will we do with 
these people who are no longer employed by the telephone company

if there is a collapse of housing prices it is a 
mysterious one because it hasnt shown up in the statistics 
the most reliable national numbers obtainable show existinghome 
prices are higher than they were last year affordability 
measurements are fair to good mortgage costs though higher 
recently are below yearago levels 
its a picture not of deterioration but of stability but 
somehow it isnt painted that way 
discovering the reason why isnt easy any more than it is easy 
to explain how the media can carry so many stories about layoffs 
and plant shutdowns while the jobless rate remains stuck at 53 
percent since last summer 
one possible clue relates to the importance people place on jobs 
and homes few things are more important so it is possible that 
any suggestion of bad news becomes exaggerated out of proportion 
perhaps 
norman flynn of madison wis president of the national 
association of realtors offers another idea 
speaking of condominium sales he commented recently that 
because of its large share of condos and coops when the 
northeast condo market has slight tremors the rest of the country 
experiences an earthquake 
that inference fits into a larger one involving not just housing 
but politics and economics it is the eastern establishment effect 
or the egocentric tendency for ideas and events in that area to be 
maximized 
but oddly even in the northeast where in some localities 
apartment coops and condos have sat empty for a year prices 
overall have held in 1988 the median price was 110600 
according to the nar last year it was 110800 
other statistics offer little more evidence of a collapse 
sales of existing singlefamily homes last year totaled 359 
million units which indeed was down by 46 percent from the 
previous year but that previous year was the strongest of the 
entire decade of the 1980s 
in prices there is even less evidence of problems the national 
median price for existing singlefamily homes in december was 
92500 or 43 percent above the yearearlier median of 88700 
even in the northeast where economies have slowed from boom 
times the median price for 1989 rose to 145200 from 143000 
the only clue to resolving the mystery might lie in sales 
figures for the northeast they fell in 1989 existing 
singlefamily sales were 585000 down 88000 units from the year 
before and the lowest since 1984 
moreover last years sales decline was the third in a row since 
the decades peak sales of 703000 units in 1986 much of the 
decline was in the larger more prominent cities where change 
could become magnified 
in certain local areas throughout the northeast both building 
and selling activity all but came to a halt in some communities 
near new york city for example the average selling time was close 
to 250 days three years ago it was not uncommon for houses to 
generate bids in the first week of listing 
theres a random assortment of other clues to account for the 
impression of a housing debacle among them 
homebuilding did decline for all 1989 total residential 
permits fell 79 percent to 1340600 lowest since 1982 according 
to us housing markets a national survey published by lomas 
mortgage usa 
the decline was steepest in the northeast 186 percent and the 
south 113 percent 
commercial building also declined in addition many owners of 
existing buildings and their bankers ran into highly publicized 
financial problems but very few of these disasters involved 
singlefamily housing 
the days of putting tags on houses far beyond the existing 
market level in hopes that buyers would chase prices ended 
abruptly as a result asking prices did fall but not necessarily 
below prices of a year earlier 
generally speaking numbers often confirm impressions this time 
they are at odds it just doesnt add up as they say

actually boosting the industry 
americans are treating themselves to confections and sweets 
but because they are more health conscious and working out they 
dont feel as guilty said spokesman brian muloney in fact 
theres more working out and pigging out 
and there are some who will literally pig out 
paradise pigs which sells the latest trendy pet vietnamese 
potbellied pigs says it has received orders for valentines day 
pigs which cost from 1500 to 2500 for males and about 5000 
for females 
the pigs are prized because they stay small ranging from 25 
pounds to 150 pounds and have sunny dispositions 
for a lot of our customers its like having a kid said 
paradise pigs owner kris bryant husbands are buying them for 
their wives men are buying them for their girlfriends 
bryant said her pigs try to knock the phone from her hand when 
they think shes been talking long enough that might make them a 
good buy for parents of teenagers 
be it a dozen roses or a porcine bundle of joy most people will 
wonder about their valentines day gift was it given sincerely or 
was it just an obligatory gesture 
people spend a good deal of time wondering if a gift is 
sincere said sociologist hy mariampolski and givers also worry 
whether their presents will be enjoyed he said 
people are very insecure about gifts being appreciated so they 
fall into patterns of safe gift giving said mariampolski who 
studies giftgiving habits for qualidata research inc in new york 
one way to make sure your gift is wellregarded is to personalize 
it he said 
it may be a bouquet of flowers he said but if a guy has 
it delivered to his girlfriends doorstep by a strolling musician 
its going to be very special

the identity of the first st valentine is about as mysterious 
as love itself 
historians say valentines day has its origins in the third 
century when two christian martyrs both named valentine were 
executed a pagan festival to fertility called the lupercalia was 
still being celebrated at that time and because it fell around the 
martyrs feb 14 feast day st valentine became the protector of 
lovers 
the people of terni italy a steelmaking town between rome and 
perugia insist their st valentine was the one who started the 
annual day of love the towns patron saint was beheaded feb 14 in 
the year 270 after having been imprisoned and whipped 
legend has it that valentine had a garden where he let children 
play and lovers meet while imprisoned valentine tied the keys of 
the garden gate to two pigeons with a message inviting the children 
to return to the garden 
a version of the terni story has valentine in his 76 years as 
bishop giving lovers flowers from the garden one couple who 
encountered the bishop enjoyed such a happy marriage that every 
couple wanted his blessing 
the story is complicated by a second st valentine also 
beheaded in the third century in rome and who also has a feast 
day feb 14 
but valentine 2 may not have been a saint at all some 
scholars say a church built on romes via flaminia by a man named 
valentine somehow became known as st valentines church starting 
a legend about a nonexistent saint 
the roman catholic church takes a neutral stance and designates 
no patron saint of lovers the vatican congregation for the causes 
of saints says 17 valentines are listed in the official 
encyclopedia of saints including ones from italy france spain 
and germany 
ternis bishop franco gualdrini also refuses to claim his 
towns saint as the definitive champion of love 
it is a popular tradition gualdrini once said of the 
adulation st valentine now receives some things are proclaimed 
from above some are proclaimed from below

calling your film a documentary is like a 
politician today admitting that hes a liberal laments texas 
documentary maker al reinert 
its a sure way to run off the studio people he said 
the times may be achanging thanks to michael moores 
laceratingly funny roger and me the documentary may be 
escaping rodney dangerfield status and gaining some respect 
moore was able to win a warner bros release and his 260000 
investment has already sold more than 3 million worth of tickets 
in theaters 
reinert hopes he can match moores achievement with for all 
mankind its the first bigscreen look at the achievements of 
us astronauts who adventured to the moon from december 1968 to 
november 1972 
like moore reinert had no experience as a filmmaker when he 
visited nasa headquarters in houston on a magazine assignment 10 
years ago he learned that 6 million feet of film languished in the 
apollo and gemini archives 
i thought it was bigscreen material reinert said trying 
to tell this story on television was like publishing war and 
peace in a newspaper its too big for the medium 
he figures his ignorance of filmmaking was an advantage i saw 
this wonderful film and i knew it was a great story i thought 
this is an easy movie to make theyve done all the hard work to 
my surprise i discovered there was still an enormous amount of 
work to do 
i was amazed nobody had made this movie before looking back 
on it 10 years later i can understand why nobody made it before 
he began by reviewing the millions of feet of film and 
interviewing many of the astronauts whose memories provide the 
soundtrack transferring the film to 35mm stock was a tedious 
process and the enterprise repeatedly ran out of money reinert 
had to cease operations and hustle for contributions 
for all mankind has won high praise at film festivals and in 
test screenings in a few cities the battle is not over the film 
still hasnt attracted a distributor an academy award nomination 
might help 
the greatest impact of for all mankind comes not from the 
moon walks but from looks back at the earth reinert observes 
for the astronauts looking at the moon was secondary to 
leaving the earth he says the moon is just the first place 
you can stop what happened was that these people would look back 
over their shoulders with their noses to the window staring at the 
earth for days and days as it went from the size of a beach ball to 
a basketball to a softball and finally to the point where you 
could cover it up with your thumb 
thats the way to put not only your life but human life in 
perspective and really develop an appreciation for this magical 
delicate place where we live i learned that from the astronauts 
and also i fell in love with the images of the planet earth the 
most beautiful pictures ever taken are of the earth 
reinert sees hope for the longneglected documentary to make a 
dent on the movie market 
look at whats happened with writing it was only 20 years ago 
that nonfiction writing was considered very much of a subgenre 
serious writers were expected to write fiction nonfiction books 
sold very poorly relative to fiction he said 
nowadays nonfiction books are right up there on bestseller 
lists with fiction good writers go right back and forth between 
fiction and nonfiction the same thing might prove to be the case 
with filmmakers

this must be freedonia 
thats freedonia with two es not to be confused with 
fredonia ny probably to be confused with the mythical land of 
the marx movie duck soup and the home of current marxist 
thought the freedonia gazette magazine 
a bedroom a bathroom a living room and dining area is all 
there is but seemingly every square inch of paul wesolowskis 
posterplastered condo is a memorial to the work of the marx 
brothers 
movie posters in the entry staircase make clear his commitment 
to groucho harpo and chico and zeppo and dont forget gummo oh 
yes theres also manfred who died at age 3 you come to learn 
such things during a visit with wesolowski 
drop by and half expect groucho to come shuffling through as 
hugo z hackenbush or otis b driftwood cigar in hand of course 
he wont but there are enough groucho glasses frame nose 
eyebrows and mustache lining wesolowskis bedroom ceiling to 
satisfy a crowd of groucho wannabes 
i was flabbergasted said maxine marx chicos daughter 
oh sure she keeps albums but her trip to wesolowskis marx 
brothers shrine in 1988 was another matter 
i said this is my family and this would drive me bonkers 
she recalls 
wesolowskis interest in the marx brothers so impressed groucho 
biographer hector arce that it led to a 10day visit with the 
comedian who picked up the tab eight months before he died in 
1977 at age 86 
physically he was an old man he walked very slowly his 
speech was slurred wesolowski said but mentally he was still 
sharp 
when arce told marx he would show wesolowski and a friend around 
the beverly hills house groucho quipped good show em the 
servants entrance better yet show em the servants exit 
what had caught arces eye was wesolowskis research so drawn 
was wesolowski to the marx brothers after seeing duck soup on 
television in 1974 that he left his tracks in libraries across the 
country 
i stayed up and i watched it and thought it was the funniest 
movie id ever seen wesolowski said 
when he could find free time from his accounting studies at st 
josephs university he looked up marx brothers information he and 
a friend celebrated graduation in 1978 by spending a month visiting 
libraries in cities where the brothers performed he kept filing 
material away not really sure what hed do with it 
the result is research and a collection wesolowski bills as 
the most complete marx brothers research facility on this 
planet he did at least wait several years to see if hed run 
across something close 
in the past couple of years ive decided that there is nobody 
else he said 
hes received calls from magazines and quiz shows to verify marx 
facts or quotes hes not afraid to correct even maxine marx who 
remembers his admonishment after she gave a lecture he said 
you gave a wrong date 
even if wesolowski can find evidence of his admitted obsession 
behind the couch where more old movie posters await a chance for 
display a fellow marx fan sealed it with a chance meeting in 
london of all places 
there after searching through book stores for marx brothers 
books he came upon a cinema book store that had not only the books 
he wanted but also another customer asking the shopkeeper if a 
marx brothers expert from pennsylvania named paul wesolowski had 
ever come in the store the customer turned out to be a freedonia 
gazette subscriber in great britain 
i said hes in your store right now wesolowski said 
that was the most bizarre coincidence of my life thats what 
im talking about when i talk about the fun of collecting 
marx brothers movie posters and lobby cards line wesolowskis 
apartment wall to wall floor to ceiling in varying sizes and 
colors and languages they bill animal crackers a night in 
casablanca love happy a day at the races and other 
films 
it makes it real easy when i want to rearrange the 
furniture wesolowski said 
these items dont include grouchos personal brass cufflinks a 
gift to wesolowski from grouchos sisterinlaw the groucho clock 
with eyes swinging back and forth like a pendulum the groucho hat 
rack puppets and wooden and ceramic figurines or the red marx 
brothers at the circus sleeping bag from france 
he also had street signs made with names of the brothers and 
characters from their movies now he has hugo z hackenbush 
expressway running through the living room which shows off his 
time and effort 
spending 10 days with groucho made it all worthwhile he 
said

dame margot fonteyns importance in the history 
of ballet can hardly be exaggerated 
she was the first ballerina of international status to be 
developed by a british school and company and to audiences 
thrilled by her dancing during a 45year career she always seemed 
like a nice person too 
personality is conveyed across the footlights dame margot said 
during a recent visit to new york 
it shows through your movement and your dancing she said 
i think if your personality doesnt come through then youre a 
little immature as an artist i think thats part of being an 
artist it is not just doing the steps it is part of yourself that 
is conveyed through your dancing 
in the sleeping beauty which was supposed to be my best 
role im smiling happy optimistic cheerful 
television audiences will have a chance to meet dame margot and 
see for themselves friday when the margot fonteyn story is 
shown on pbss great performances series from 9 to 1030 pm 
est 
british producerdirector patricia foy says she nagged dame 
margot for five years after her career ended a decade ago at age 60 
to consider the project 
dame margots personal story is told on the show as well as her 
dancing story 
she met roberto arias son of the president of panama in 
cambridge england during the summer of 1937 when the sadlers 
wells ballet was performing there and he was in college they saw 
each other in 1938 and 39 and then not again for 14 years in the 
interim he had married and she had come close to marriage 
they were married in 1955 and he was made panamanian ambassador 
to britain in 1964 when he was running for office in panama 
bullets from an assassination attempt left him paralyzed dame 
margot was interviewed for the tv show in 1988 at the cattle ranch 
in panama where they lived after she retired 
people asked if i was going to teach when i stopped dancing i 
said i imagine ill sit by my husband and be fat and happy 
she was happy and enjoyed panamas warm weather but didnt gain 
weight 
she lives there now since his death last november trying to 
continue his cattle breeding plans i dont know if i can really 
manage but im going to try anyway because thats what id rather 
do than anything else she says 
he had three children each of whom has a son and daughter and 
dame margot was visiting one family here 
during her interview with the associated press she graciously 
invited a young arias grandson named roberto brillembourg into the 
living room to sing i was taken by surprise by a pair of penguin 
eyes which will accompany a penguin dance hes rehearsing for 
school 
instead of memorizing what she said for tv or reading from a 
teleprompter which seemed stilted dame margot says she 
concentrated on areas to talk about in 1983 she was host of the 
sixpart series magic of dance and became used to that 
technique 
when she first started ballet lessons her name was peggy 
hookham everybody thought it should be changed she said in 
those days everybody changed their name and now almost nobody 
changes their name fonteyn came from the brazilian side of my 
family fontes sort of a near approach there are one or two 
programs where im margot fontes then i became fonteyn when i was 
first in the corps de ballet i dont know what the name was 
during world war ii the sadlers wells ballet performed seven 
eight or nine times a week i would be in not less than seven 
one got very tired there were two steps in swan lake and 
giselle that were similar at some point i decided i would do the 
same step in both ballets because i would get tired to the point it 
would worry me a bit to know which i was doing 
at one point i got so exhausted that my main concern when i 
was doing a variation was that i wouldnt run off the stage before 
the end i was frightened i wouldnt have control over what i was 
doing she said 
occasionally i see the step wrong in the second act of swan 
lake the way i changed it long ago its a tiny little detail 
she was in new york to coach birthday offering in which she 
was one of the original seven ballerinas for american ballet 
theater sir frederick ashton created it for the 25th birthday of 
the sadlers wells which became britains royal ballet in 1956 
she doesnt often coach for ballet companies but enjoys it now 
new dancers come into the cast there are always some little 
details and things that get lost i think i can help in small 
ways she said 
last year she coached for three weeks in houston and for three 
weeks with the royal ballet 
dame margots first major creation was in an ashton ballet in 
1935 and though the years she did many interestingly sir 
frederick recalls on television what he thought of her in 1933 and 
includes the words inadequate and stubborn 
the tv show begins with a swan lake staged by rudolf nureyev 
for the vienna opera he and dame margot were filmed dancing in it 
in 1964 
earlier dame margot danced with robert helpmann which she says 
helped her develop stage presence 
if he was playing the title role in coppelia and you were 
swanilda the doll you didnt have a hope she said nobody 
was ever going to look at anybody else while he was there he was a 
genius so funny 
if youre on the stage with somebody who has this tremendous 
magnetism and charisma if youre there beside him you have to try 
to do something otherwise youre going to be a nonentity working 
with him greatly helped me to develop as a stage performer so that 
people might see me as well

anyone familiar with toyota probably knows the celica name it 
is toyotas secondoldest nameplate in this country after the 
corolla 
this year two decades after the first celica crossed american 
shores toyota makes the popular celica sleeker and more 
aerodynamic than ever 
the redesigned 1990 celica line includes its first 
fourwheeldrive model and offers a larger selection of engines 
the 22liter 16valve electronic fuelinjected fourcylinder 
model that powered the celica gts test car seemed ready and able 
to take on more than just that cars 2800 pounds 
this marks the fifth major redesign of the celica in the two 
months following last falls introduction toyota sold more than 
12800 celicas outperforming its primary import competitors the 
honda prelude and the nissan 240sx said toyota spokesman mike 
michels the company would not estimate sales for the entire 1990 
model year 
over its history sales of the celica have tended to rise when 
the car is redesigned in 1986 for example sales went up to 
106731 from 80482 in 1985 after a redesigned 1986 model arrived 
in showrooms since then sales have dropped each year to 79333 
in 1987 to 66053 in 1988 and to 61936 in 1989 
the 1990 celicas new sporty look appeals to women twothirds 
of recent buyers were female with a median age of 30 twothirds 
of recent buyers are single and 69 percent are college graduates 
toyota said 
the bright red gts test car reminded me of the mazda miata in 
outside styling the celica is eyecatching with its low rounded 
front slightly flared fenders and quarter panels and builtin 
colormatched bumpers the metal was clean devoid of metal strips 
and trim the only protrusion was the rear spoiler 
youll have to lift items up and into the cargo area given the 
design of the rear hatchback and the spare tire creates a slightly 
raised circle in the middle so trunk space is not flat the rear 
seats fold down for additional space 
fit and finish were admirable inside and out not surprising 
considering toyotas reputation for quality cars the celica has 
ranked much better than average in consumer reports magazines 
owner trouble index for the 198488 model years 
but the test cars rear seat area was cramped only two adults 
can sit there and they had best be short and thin even at 
5feet4 i found my head smacking into the celicas sloping 
roofline in the back seat and since the rear seats are sculpted 
there was pitifully little hiproom for heftier passengers 
the front seats complete with articulated headrests were far 
more comfortable the test car had the optional sevenway 
adjustable driver seat with lumbar support which made for easy 
positioning 
toyota did a masterful job of gathering and organizing the cars 
gauges and instruments around the cockpitstyle dashboard all are 
within easy reach of the driver and have goodsized buttons and 
knobs a handy cup holder pops out from under the radio 
the premium radio system by the way was superb with 10 
speakers including a little round one at the window near the 
outside side mirror 
the test cars standard engine didnt act like a little 
fourcylinder at all in fact the gts with a fivespeed 
transmission had so much power that the front tires often grabbed 
aggressively at the road when i tried to accelerate quickly from a 
stop unfortunately on wet and slick surfaces they werent always 
successful and it was also tricky keeping this sporty car steady 
on roads lightly dusted with snow 
celica competitors include lowerpriced cars such as the 
plymouth laser which starts around 11000 and the laser 
turbocharged model starting at 14000 the base price of the 
nissan 240sx is about 13250 celicas begin at 12268 although 
the gts test car was base priced at 4000 more because of its 
engine and other standard features

barry bostwick says he didnt encounter any 
objections within the space community to the abc movie 
challenger which explores the lives of the seven astronauts 
killed in the shuttle explosion 
i think everyone had a waitandsee attitude said the 
actor who plays mission commander francis r dick scobee we 
were scratching around a wound that hadnt quite healed what i got 
from the nasa people was that it was a certain catharsis working 
with us 
challenger which airs sunday also examines the debate over 
the safety of the shuttles solid rocket boosters 
the threehour movie which ends with liftoff just before the 
shuttle exploded on jan 28 1986 stars karen allen as christa 
mcauliffe the new hampshire schoolteacher chosen by the national 
aeronautics and space administration to join the shuttle crew 
the other five astronaut roles julie fulton as dr judith a 
resnick richard jenkins as gregory b jarvis brian kerwin as 
capt michael j smith keone young as lt col ellison onizuka 
and joe morton as dr ronald e mcnair 
lane smith as larry mulloy of nasa and peter boyle as 
engineer roger boisjoly of mortonthiokol co carry on the debate 
over the safety of the oring joints sealing the solid rocket 
boosters boisjoly feared the freezing temperatures at the cape 
could cause the seals to fail 
challenger was filmed on location at the johnson space 
center in houston 
we had so much input from nasa and the families bostwick 
said i think the feeling was that somebody was going to do this 
story with or without their help and it was best to see that it 
was told right 
these jobs only come along once in a few years he said 
being an actor allows you to explore other worlds i was allowed 
to go through the whole nasa experience and work with such 
excellent people and train on the same equipment the astronauts 
use 
bostwick described scobee as a straightahead guy 
he was chosen as commander because he was solid and steady 
the actor said he wasnt a hotshot i talked to a lot of his 
friends after i got to houston i looked at some training films so 
i could observe him in action see how he took control 
george englunds screenplay despite an occasional tendency 
toward boosterism presents the astronauts their families and nasa 
officials as real human beings rather than stick figures in a 
docudrama director glenn jordan invests it with a dramatic tension 
that holds interest even though the world knows the conclusion 
bostwick is now at work on a musical version of aladdin for 
the disney channel in which he plays the genie its part of a 
package similar to showtimes faerie tale theatre put 
together by martin tahse from childrens musicals done by the 
prince street theater mickey dolenz of the monkees is directing 
its my first musical since the pirates of penzance seven 
years ago bostwick said but i still sing at least once a 
year i sang at the white house last year the year before that i 
did an evening at carnegie hall im also in discussions for a 
musical based on the thin man called nick and nora 
bostwick is avoiding any commitment to a new tv series after 
stints in two shortlived ones foul play and dads 
hes certainly done his share of miniseries nearly rivaling 
richard chamberlain as the king of the long form among his 
miniseries credits scruples deceptions george 
washington george washington ii the forging of a nation 
a woman of substance and war and remembrance 
doing an hour show can shorten your life he said the 
hours and the stress are too much work has never been an 
allconsuming thing for me anyway im the kind of person who has a 
lot of hobbies 
bostwick has planted 80 varieties of fruit trees at his hillside 
home including many exotic fruits and is attempting to raise 
orchids 
ive been looking into some alternate professions something 
to keep my interest up and tide me over if abcs not doing 
miniseries this year he said i went to belize with a friend a 
few weeks ago to look into some agricultural and aquaculture 
investments we looked at five or six shrimp farms and found they 
were all for sale

colombian officials battle a cocaine 
establishment so ruthless and powerful that their best hope is to 
ship its leaders when they can be caught to the united states 
the peruvian government encounters not entrenched highly 
successful businessmen but peasants whose livelihood is the coca 
crop and leftist guerrillas who battle the government in the name 
of the poor 
in bolivia impoverished farmers eagerly accept government 
payments in return for destroying coca crops on which they spend 
more money than they make but the government wonders what the 
peasants will do with themselves if theyre not growing the raw 
material for cocaine 
the leaders of these nations will meet with president bush on 
thursday to coordinate their efforts in what they say will be an 
unstoppable assault on drug traffickers but each faces his own 
reality and must approach the war on drugs in his own way 
here is the situation in the three andean countries which 
together account for most of the worlds cocaine production 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
over the years colombian traffickers led by the medellin and 
cali cartels have murdered thousands of their countrymen and 
turned entire regions into cocaineproduction centers 
so strong are the cartels ringleaders that president virgilio 
barco fearful that his nations judicial system is not up to the 
task has made hunting down and extraditing the nations top 
traffickers his first priority in the war on drugs 
plainly he feels justice has a better chance of prevailing in 
the united states where 80 percent of the cocaine supply comes 
from the two cartels than in colombia 
colombian police have been going hog wild on locating 
colombians for extradition said a knowledgeable us official 
adding but they havent been able to go after the cocaine labs 
at the same time 
the governments focus has indeed shifted in the six months of 
the extradition campaign from targeting the jungle labs that 
process raw coca leaves from peru and bolivia to focusing on the 
men who call the shots 
theres a downside to barcos efforts 
the us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
that the supply of cocaine leaving colombia after taking a sharp 
dive in the weeks after the campaign began has rebounded nearly to 
its earlier level 
the official said independent traffickers not associated with 
any organization have filled in the gaps torn in the cartels by the 
government offensive 
despite its failure to make a lasting dent in cocaine output 
the colombian crackdown has shown some results 
the government reported recently that authorities have taken 
over 777 of the traffickers properties worth millions of dollars 
fourteen drug suspects have been sent to the united states and 
one leader of the medellin cartel gonzalo rodriguez gacha was 
killed in a dec 15 gunfight 
authorities last year seized nearly 27 million gallons of 
imported industrial chemicals used to process coca into cocaine 
the year before less than 1 million gallons of such chemicals were 
confiscated 
the jump was astounding and proved to the world that colombia 
was serious about fighting cocaine trafficking said the us 
official 
the acting chief of the national police gen carlos arturo 
casadiego put it this way in a recent interview 
this war will continue until there are no more drug 
traffickers walking freely in colombia that is our goal it is not 
negotiable

since september 30 or so us drug agents contract pilots and 
mechanics have been launching raids with peruvian police against 
jungle drug laboratories and clandestine airstrips 
but rebel activity in the upper huallaga valley where most of 
the countrys coca crop is grown has kept the agents from 
operating freely last year they pulled out of the valley for seven 
months after an american helicopter pilot was wounded by gunfire 
maoist shining path guerrillas controlling much of the valley 
offer protection to drug traffickers in exchange for a share of the 
profits the rebels also make sure the traffickers do not cheat the 
peasant coca growers 
peru accounts for 60 percent of the worlds coca leaf crop 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in bolivia where drugrelated violence is much less of a 
problem than in colombia or peru the government has made some 
gains against coca growing in recent months with a croperadication 
program that pays farmers to destroy their coca fields 
in december and january farmers voluntarily destroyed a record 
512 acres of coca in chapare the region where 80 percent of the 
countrys coca plants are found 
farmers get the equivalent of 800 for every acre they destroy 
peasants are lining up for the money because 100 pounds of coca 
leaf now sells for 5 to 7 but costs about 30 to grow 
in the last few months the jaime paz zamora government has 
made significant progress in law enforcement eradication 
interdiction and crop substitution programs us ambassador 
robert s gelbard said in a recent interview 
but he added that colombias war against traffickers was 
partially responsible for the bolivian success the colombian 
crackdown lowered the price paid for coca because demand for the 
leaf fell when traffickers dropped out of sight 
bolivia accounts for onethird of international coca leaf 
production 
bolivian authorities worry as do those in peru what peasants 
will do with themselves if the eradication program is a 
thoroughgoing success 
an estimated 300000 peasants in chapare depend on coca 
production for their livlihood many have complained that the 
government is eradicating the crop without offering an alternative 
and that they benefited little from 40 million provided by the 
united states for crop substitution last year 
the government in peru says as many as 200000 peruvians make 
their living by growing the coca bush president alan garcia has 
resisted eradication programs such as the one in bolivia because he 
does not want to drive displaced coca farmers into the hands of the 
maoist guerrillas 
the approach to the drug fight may vary but one thing all three 
nations agree on is the need to gain more economic assistance from 
the united states in return for their participation 
the bush administration has earmarked 270 million this year for 
colombia bolivia and peru but some foreign officials say all 
three countries will likely ask for more

congress has its starting point on a 1990 farm 
bill and the bush administration has one too exactly where the 
legislative route will lead and what the trip will cost taxpayers 
is unknown 
months of dickering and bickering remain and scores of pressure 
groups want a slice of the action budget constraints hover but if 
recent history is any guide the 1990 edition will not be cheap 
the current law the food security act of 1985 expires at the 
end of the 1990 crop season meaning most of the farm commodity 
costs will spill over into the 1991 fiscal year that begins oct 1 
since passage of the 1985 law federal spending on commodity 
programs has totaled an estimated 794 billion a record amount 
for a fiveyear period during the period however the amount went 
down each year 
according to the agriculture departments budget office net 
outlays by the commodity credit corp have decreased from a record 
258 billion in fiscal 1986 to 224 billion in 1987 125 
billion in 1988 105 billion in 1989 and an estimated 82 
billion in 1990 
farm commodity costs at usda now run a distant second to food 
stamps and other consumer services which total about 234 billion 
this year 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter last week issued a long 
wish list for congress to consider but he evaded cost issues 
yeutter said those will be worked out with lawmakers when the time 
comes that did not sit well with some lawmakers who say it is time 
for the administration to speak more plainly 
but the administrations 1990 farm proposals still were not a 
bad opening gambit as congress bears down on the legislation 
said don lipton of the american farm bureau federation 
rep kika de la garza dtexas had an opening gambit too as 
chairman of the house agriculture committee he and the ranking 
minority member rep edward r madigan rill introduced their 
own food and agricultural resources act of 1990 serving notice on 
the bush people that the committee would begin with or without them 
de la garza said the measure continues the policies we 
hammered out in the 1985 act and its subsequent amendments it 
continues the combination of marketoriented polices and farm 
income protection which has helped american agriculture recover 
from its economic crisis of the 1980s 
madigan said the bill based on the 1985 law will serve as an 
excellent starting point for our committee deliberations 
one of the features of the house bill is a freeze on target 
prices for wheat and feed grains at their 1990 level minimum 
target prices for cotton and rice would be extended for 1991 
through 1995 crops 
soybean price support loan rates would be extended through 1995 
at 75 percent of an annual average for the previous five years 
excluding the high and low years 
the target prices and price support mechanisms would be 
potential targets for reduction under the bush administrations 
plan although yeutter did not spell out any details 
a keystone of the administrations strategy involves added 
flexibility for commodity programs so that farmers can 
basically plant what they want without losing base acreage credit 
or suffering other penalties 
the house bill did not include a flexibility provision but de 
la garza said the administrations proposals may have an impact 
as we deliberate our bill there are no items in our bill and the 
administration proposals that cannot be worked out 
but there are a few potential sticking points 
environmental and health issues including water quality food 
safety and global changes are expected to produce some of the most 
heated debate the bush administration says usda should take an 
active role in research and education on environmental issues 
but congress may insist on more 
while the house bill introduced by de la garza and madigan 
would continue minimum price support loan rates for cotton and 
rice the bush plan seeks their elimination that would make the 
loan rate formula for cotton and rice the same as for wheat and 
feed grains the minimum for soybeans however would be maintained 
under both plans 
peanuts are one of the few commodities whose supports are tied 
to production costs the house bill would continue the practice 
but the bush proposal says the costofproduction escalator should 
be eliminated along with the sale and lease of peanut quotas 
the house bill would extend the minimum sugar support level of 
18 cents per pound through 1995 crops of sugar cane the sugar beet 
level would have to be at a fair and reasonable level relative 
to cane the bush proposals do not spell out what the 
administration has in mind for sugar although there is pressure 
within the government to reduce sugar supports sharply 
the bush plan calls for elimination of federal crop insurance 
and the formation of a permanent disaster relief program although 
yeutter said the administration is open to discussion if congress 
opts for a complete overhaul of crop insurance 
under the bush plan the farmers home administration would 
provide for better targeting of farm operating and farm 
ownership loans and would curb certain program abuses involved 
in the restructuring of heavy debt loads further shifts to fmha 
loan guarantees to private lenders are recommended

every man is said to have his peculiar ambition whether it be 
true or not i can say for one that i have no other so great as 
that of being truly esteemed of my fellow man by rendering myself 
worthy of their esteem abraham lincoln 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when abraham lincoln received the republican 
partys nomination for president in 1860 the new york herald 
dismissed him as a fourthrate lecturer who cannot speak good 
grammar and who to raise the wind delivers his hackneyed 
illiterate compositions at 200 apiece 
the man later compared to mark twain for his gift with the 
english language was nicknamed ignoramus abe old scoundrel and 
filthy storyteller 
i have endured a great deal of ridicule without much malice 
and received a great deal of kindness not quite free of ridicule 
lincoln once said referring to the condescending treatment his 
homespun style received even from friends 
but historians have seen him differently finding richness in 
the language of a poor country lawyer the library of america 
which has previously published the works of twain henry james and 
other celebrated writers is honoring lincoln with a twovolume 
35 publication of his speeches and letters lincoln speeches 
and writings 18321858 and lincoln speeches and writings 
18591865 
how do we define literature asked editor don e 
fehrenbacher author of lincoln in text and context collected 
essays and the dred scott case its significance in american 
law and politics which won the pulitzer prize for history in 
1979 
he is able to write in such a way as to express deep emotion 
under artistic control thats what we look for in a ernest 
hemingway or in a henry james and thats what we get in lincolns 
best works 
that combination of something fundamental to say that goes 
beyond mere intellect there is artistry in his letters that ear 
for the english language 
the author of the gettysburg address composed all his own 
speeches despite spending only 12 months in school he was part 
philosopher part politician part poet his influences included 
shakespeare the king james version of the bible and longtime 
speaker of the house henry clay whose dealmaking earned him the 
nickname the great compromiser 
lincoln was a progressive pragmatist he staked his political 
career on opposition to slavery but tempered that with assurances 
that blacks would be better off living in their own country once 
freed i have no desire to own a slave or to marry one was how 
he summed up his position 
he first presented himself as lagging sadly behind a 
reluctant almost embarrassed public servant more familiar with 
the straight path back to his kentucky log cabin on nolan creek 
than the winding uphill climb to the white house 
in an open letter to the people of illinois sangamon county 
published march 9 1832 lincoln offered sincere cutanddry 
analyses of local issues as he urged consideration for election to 
the illinois general assembly and concluded with a near apology for 
taking up the voters time 
he was born feb 12 1809 the second child of pioneer farmer 
and carpenter thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln he was just 2 
when his family moved out of the log cabin to a 230acre farm on 
knob creek 11 miles northeast of hodgenville ky 
in his early 20s after the family moved to indiana and then to 
illinois lincoln made his home outside decatur ill and gave his 
first known political speech in 1830 favoring improved navigation 
on the sangamon river 
in 1834 a year after he was appointed postmaster of new salem 
he was elected as a whig to the illinois house of representatives 
and served four terms during that time he received a license to 
practice law and began his public opposition to slavery 
the main routes upwards for men who were not well born were 
law and politics fehrenbacher explained there werent that 
many openings and politics were much more central in those days 
the crowds came out and listened for hours 
elected to congress in 1846 lincoln served just one term 
bitterly questioning president james k polks use of troops in the 
mexican war he left washington after failing to receive an 
appointment from the administration of president zachary taylor a 
fellow whig 
his life in politics seemingly over lincoln practiced law in 
springfield where he lived with his wife the former mary todd 
whom he married in 1842 and three sons robert todd tad and 
willie a fourth son edward died at age 3 
the slavery issue had apparantly been settled in 1820 when clay 
helped craft the missouri compromise which allowed the south to 
keep slaves but required abolition in a large section of 
territories in the midwest the agreement however fell apart in 
1854 when congress passed the kansasnebraska act which repealed 
the antislavery language of the missouri compromise in favor of 
local sovereignty 
an enraged lincoln insisting that the spirit of 76 and 
the spirit of nebraska are utter antagonisms cut back on his 
promising legal work and set his sights on the us senate 
thus was born the most famous political rivalry of the time 
lincoln the gangly moody proponent of abolition and illinois 
sen stephen douglas the squat gregarious author of the 
kansasnebraska act and a powerful northern democrat 
in 1856 lincoln helped found the republican party of illinois 
which opposed slavery he warned two years later that a house 
divided against itself cannot stand anticipating that the united 
states could not remain intact with conflicting laws 
fehrenbacher said the lincolndouglas debates included in their 
entirety in the twovolume compilation made lincoln a national 
figure 
thousands attended each of the seven confrontations all held 
outdoors and frequently interrupted the speeches with loud 
applause and cries of encouragement the format was broken into 
three parts a onehour opening statement a 1hour reply and a 
halfhour rejoinder 
slavery was virtually the only issue douglas made overtly 
racist appeals and insisted the government was made for the 
benefit of white men and their posterity for ever 
said lincoln 
you say it must not be opposed in the free states because 
slavery is not here it must not be opposed in the slaves states 
because it is there it must not be opposed in politics because 
that will make a fuss it must not be opposed in the pulpit 
because it is not religion then where is the place to oppose it 
douglas won the election but lincoln was pleased enough with 
the debates to have them published the following year 
in the 1860 presidential campaign with the democrats badly 
splintered the election broke down into two regional campaigns 
lincoln vs douglas in the north and john c breckinridge vs john 
bell in the south

balancing the risks of narcotourism against 
the symbolism of drug diplomacy inside colombia president bush is 
heading into potentially dangerous territory on thursday for a 
cocainefighting summit 
he is not the first president to decide that a mission and a 
message should override security concerns 
bush has heard all about it from aides and from worried 
constituents in the two months since he accepted the invitation to 
go to cartagena despite colombian drug violence terrorism and 
reports the cocaine cartel would target him 
the question of his safety was raised at a speech in san 
francisco on wednesday at a barbecue in texas weeks ago in 
telephone calls to the white house switchboard 
the presidents reply he wont be reckless he doesnt want to 
be in harms way but he is determined to go to cartagena to show 
his support and solidarity with colombian president virgilio barco 
at their brief summit bush and the leaders of bolivia colombia 
and peru are to sign an agreement to cooperate in drugfighting 
efforts with us aid for crop substitution as part of the plan 
but that agenda has been overshadowed by the site of the 
conference by going to colombia even for a few hours bush 
dramatizes his antidrug campaign 
i am not going to do something stupid or macho he said in 
san francisco the guy they used to call timid is now macho 
man or something it has nothing to do with that 
it has a lot to do with the support for a courageous leader in 
colombia bush said 
he said he believes he can be kept secure for a summit at a 
naval base just as barco is protected in his own home i dont 
want to send a signal on your behalf or my behalf that the united 
states says to this great president look our president cant 
come there even though we think the security can be granted be 
guaranteed 
bush said that could push the colombian leader toward a kind 
of deal that he has resisted making with the narcotraffickers 
who have said they would stop smuggling drugs in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution 
other presidents have ventured into war zones waved off 
security concerns at home insisted on appearing where their 
bodyguards wish they wouldnt go 
bush will travel with all the security the secret service the 
air force and other military escorts can muster during the 
singleday trip the four presidents will meet at a secured sealed 
naval base on the caribbean 
the tight security is being advertised in advance as a 
deterrent because the secrecy that was part of the shield for 
earlier presidents in danger zones was impossible this time with 
both date and destination disclosed long in advance 
there will be escorts probably decoys and other steps to guard 
air force one and the presidential helicopter the white house and 
the colombian embassy both discounted reports that the drug 
traffickers were plotting to attack the presidential aircraft with 
surfacetoair missiles there also have been reports the cartel 
had put up a huge bounty on bush the president scoffed at that 
there are political and personal components to presidential 
decisions to travel to foreign trouble spots or to overrule 
security concerns at home 
twice during his presidency lyndon b johnson flew secretly to 
south vietnam in october 1966 and just before christmas in 1967 
air force one flew into the war zone landing at cam ranh bay a 
secure us base about 200 miles from saigon his trips were not 
disclosed until they were over 
so too when dwight d eisenhower as presidentelect kept a 
campaign promise by going to korea in december 1952 while war raged 
there he did not go to the front although he was at times within 
artillery range the trip was announced while eisenhower was flying 
home 
franklin d roosevelt was the first president to travel overseas 
in wartime traveling to casablanca in 1943 for a summit with world 
war ii allies 
those modern travels into potential danger passed without 
incident 
when abraham lincoln went to a civil war battle front on the 
outskirts of washington in 1864 a union soldier was killed three 
feet from where the president stood get down you fool lt 
col oliver wendell holmes is said to have shouted and lincoln 
took cover 
nobody has been that blunt about the drug summit 
bush accepted the invitation on oct 10 before the site or the 
exact date had been set cartagena quickly came up as a possible 
location and there was a report never confirmed that the secret 
service had advised against it 
cartagena it was with bushs decision to go there announced in 
bogota on dec 12 and by the white house a day later 
expressing a thought common to many of his predecessors bush 
said im not going to live in a cocoon

the future of the government program that 
insures millions of americans pensions is at stake in a supreme 
court case that will be argued this month with federal officials 
warning that an adverse ruling could eventually force a huge 
taxpayer bailout 
at issue is whether ltv steel co will succeed in dumping 
billions of dollars in pension costs onto the governments pension 
benefit guaranty corporation setting a precedent that could lead 
to similar maneuvers by other companies 
labor secretary elizabeth dole says the case will have 
farreaching ramifications for the retirement security of workers 
and pensioners across the country 
the court must decide whether the pbgc acted properly in 
ordering ltv steel a subsidiary of the dallasbased ltv corp to 
reassume responsibility for three pension plans a federal appeals 
court already has ruled against the pbgc the supreme court is 
scheduled to hear the arguments feb 27 
ltv faced with a declining steel market declared bankrupcy in 
1986 and notified the pbgc it could not pay into its pension plans 
which were underfinanced by 23 billion the burden then fell to 
the national pension insurance agency which collects premiums from 
the companies that hold pension plans for 30 million american 
workers 
ltv then worked out an agreement with the united steelworkers of 
america calling for the company to return benefits to their 
previous levels by paying the difference on top of what the pbgc 
paid pbgc describes the manuever as an abusive followon plan 
which essentially shunts billions of dollars in pension obligations 
onto the government 
in september 1987 the pbgc argued that the steel industry had 
rebounded and ordered ltv to take full responsibility for its 
pension obligations to 100000 participants ltv objected 
the steel industry did have a recovery but it did not recover 
to the extent that we could take back the pensions charles 
palmer ltvs director of corporate communications said in an 
interview pbgc in our view made an arbitrary capricious 
decision 
the pension insurance agency argues otherwise 
if the decision of the court of appeals is not reversed other 
companies will follow ltvs example and use pension insurance as a 
subsidy to reduce costs and gain a competitive edge the pbgc 
says in a brief to the supreme court the result will be a 
fundamental transformation of the pbgcs role and a dramatic 
increase in the pbgcs liabilities that could lead to a financial 
crisis similar to that currently facing the fslic 
fslic was the federal agency that went bust last year after 
paying out all its premiums to make up for losses in the savings 
and loan industry the liability then fell to the taxpayers who 
will pay at least 150 billion over the next 10 years under 
president bushs bailout plan 
like the federal savings and loan insurance program the 
pension termination insurance program is in dire financial 
condition the justice department said in a brief backing pbgcs 
claims 
the pbgc already has a more than 1 billion deficit and says the 
ltv claims would more than double that figure 
backing the governments position in the high court case are 
several steel companies that say ltv thanks to the pension 
maneuver now enjoys unfair advantages which stifle competition in 
the industry 
a court brief submitted jointly by armco bethlehem steel corp 
inland steel industries inc national steel corp and usx corp 
says ltv has gained an artifical competitive advantage that was 
never envisioned under laws governing the pension insurance program 
ltv however argues that the pbgcs charges of abuse are 
fundamentally inconsistent with the agencys duties under the 
1974 employee retirement income security act which protects 
pensioners rights 
this explicit scare reference to the unrelated sampl problem 
totally confounds common sense the unambiguous record in this 
case and all known experience ltv said in a court brief 
palmer says ltv simply does not have the wherewithal to pay into 
the pension plans 
even if pbgc wins the case he said we wouldnt have the 
money and the pension expenses would bounce right back to the 
government 
the state of ohio with 9800 ltv steel workers and wheeling 
pittsburgh steel corp another steelmaker that went into 
bankruptcy have filed briefs supporting ltvs position 
congress in 1986 addressed the pbgcs concerns not by 
banning followon plans designed to help the pension recipients 
that erisa is intended to protect wheeling pittsburgh said

looking for a present for the valentine who has 
more than everything how about an eyelid tuck or liposuction 
but at anywhere from 600 to 8000 cosmetic surgery may be too 
pricey so how does 85 a month sound for the woman or man of 
your dreams 
buyer beware 
it really is a medical procedure and all surgery has problems 
its not buying a fur coat warns dr r barrett noone a 
director of the american board of plastic surgeons which certifies 
doctors in the speciality 
dont bother lee goldsmith a physician and practicing 
lawyer says to those thinking of cosmetic surgery its an 
abused unnecessary procedure 
goldsmith only sees the failures in his new yorkarea law 
practice such as the a woman who came in after an implant with 
one breast going up and one going down and the surgeon was going 
to charge her to do it over 
but successes outnumber horror stories in the 
multibilliondollar industry an estimated 1 million to 3 million 
image enhancement procedures a year in the united states 
cher had her nose refined several years ago it looked too 
big onscreen and bothered me hey if i need cosmetic surgery the 
moment i need it im getting it ok she told people magazine 
angela lansbury went public last year periodic cosmetic surgery 
dating to 1966 has helped keep her a leading lady the star of the 
tv series murder she wrote said she decided to talk about it 
because cosmetic surgery shouldnt be just the secret of 
actresses and socialites now that its available to anyone who 
wants it and can afford it 
supporters call that accessibility democratic critics call it a 
problem 
medicine goes madison avenue with the kind of advertising 
previously reserved for the abcs automobiles beer and 
cigarettes says the staff of a house subcommittee preparing a 
bill to set some standards on how doctors can advertise such 
procedures and where they can perform the operations 
cosmetic surgery is a dangerously underregulated medical 
field said rep ron wyden dore who chaired hearings last 
spring that prompted his panel of the small business committee to 
draft the regulations 
the panel found that cosmetic surgery is often performed by 
unqualified doctors in underequipped facilities the staff report 
estimated that 3 million cosmetic operations are perfomed a year 
95 percent of them in doctors offices where crucial emergency 
equipment is often lacking some say the 3 million figure is way 
too high but theres no way to know for sure 
men accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 1988 patients for 
doctors in the american academy of cosmetic surgery and 22 percent 
of facial surgery by those in the american society of plastic and 
reconstructive surgeons 
earpinnings or croppings are big with males who had 53 
percent of those procedures reported for 1988 by the plastic and 
reconstructive surgeons group a further breakdown shows that 53 
percent of the total ear procedures was done on children age 12 or 
younger men had 23 percent of the eyelid surgery 12 percent of 
the facelifts and 13 percent of the liposuction fat removal 
the consumers dilemma and everyone seems to agree the 
consumer can get caught in the middle is that any licensed 
physician can do cosmetic surgery or brain surgery for that 
matter but the demand doesnt seem to be so high 
physicians have responded to the demand not created it 
says dr richard caleel president of the american academy of 
cosmetic surgery 
the demand or the money has induced doctors who are certified 
in gynecology ear nose and throat or whatever to turn to the 
more lucrative work a top plastic surgeon can do 16 operations a 
week at 3000 to 4000 a pop goldsmith says 
doctors can legally advertise perform operations any place they 
choose and call themselves board certified without designating the 
speciality 
this has set up a feud involving doctors trained in plastic and 
reconstructive surgery and those trained in some other specialty 
who turned to cosmetic work those who square off for or against 
advertising and those who like goldsmith say the risks of such 
elective surgery are just too great 
pity the poor consumer 
there are some very serious abuses going on out there says 
dann murphy a staff investigator for wydens committee people 
being blinded lost limbs serious scarring 
it goes well beyond a turf battle among the various medical 
groups she says and blames a big part of the problem on people 
lured into doctors offices by ads suggesting they need 
something they didnt know they wanted 
goldsmith is upset by the ads to put it mildly there is a 
tremendous selling of plastic surgery going on and much of it is 
being done by individuals who dont have the necessary skills 
advertising lets people know that techniques have improved that 
a hospital stay isnt necessary that face fixes are affordable 
that its not just for the rich and famous and quite frequently 
that one can charge it 
profiles amp contours with clinics in new york and connecticut 
runs fullpage ads with the headline look like a million for a 
couple of thousand it goes on to say you can get liposuction or 
breast enlargement for as little as 85 a month 
the groups 18page booklet with the picture of a young model 
on the cover says cosmetic surgery is not about vanity or 
selfindulgence its about feeling better about yourself as 
plastic surgery grows in awareness and acceptance it will gradually 
become as common as eyeglasses braces and hearing aids and be 
just as useful it says 
the booklet has a section on choosing a plastic surgeon that 
includes tips supporters and critics can agree on interview 
surgeons check out the hospitals theyre affiliated with make 
sure they have the proper credentials 
those on the centers mailing list got a letter recently 
offering an interest rate thats just 12 percent we can also 
help you by deferring your first payment till after the holidays 
costs range from 600 to 8000 
i call that seduction thats not the way medicine should be 
practiced noone says of ads that promise facelifts for a small 
monthly payment 
people need to know whats available says caleel who practices 
in chicago and is a professor of surgery at the chicago college of 
osteopathic medicine 
if a child is born with protruberant ears having those ears 
repositioned can be very beneficial they can be a type of stigma 
in our society he said its very rewarding to see a woman in 
her 50s get her first short haircut because she finally had 
surgery to correct large ears shed been ashamed of

stormie jones saved by the worlds first 
heartliver transplant on valentines day 1984 has her own remedy 
for dealing with the exasperating health problems that seem to 
multiply with every passing year 
she reads 
that always helps me put my worries and frustrations away 
said the 12yearold mystery buff i know my liver problem is 
never going away and i know my heart problem is never going to go 
away so i dont worry about it too much 
she also writes 
i feel better when i write my thoughts down 
in many ways stormie is much like any other adolescent girl 
said her mother lois purcell 33 were into boys and a 
different kind of music than mom listens to makeup the whole nine 
yards 
if somebody says hey were having a slumber party i let 
her go she goes skating now she wants to go to the mall and get 
her ears pierced 
more than any other year since her historic operation though 
the past one has been tough for one of transplantations most 
celebrated patients 
stormie was doing super good and leading a fairly normal 
life in white settlement texas until october 1988 when she was 
readmitted to childrens hospital of pittsburgh for possible organ 
rejection mrs purcell said she improved the next month after 
surgeons removed a bile duct obstruction 
she was back again in january 1989 because of elevated enzyme 
levels that interfered with her antirejection medication 
cyclosporine 
she started losing liver function in november and returned 
again dr thomas e starzl replaced her cyclosporine with an 
experimental japanese drug fk506 believed to be 50 to 100 times 
more powerful with fewer side effects she takes a pill every day 
and will for the rest of her life 
the setback prompted mrs purcell to remove the sixthgrader 
from school this year and rehire her home tutor 
stormie returned to childrens hospital on jan 6 with more 
liver problems tests showed no evidence of organ rejection but 
rather a noninfectious form of hepatitis she was discharged six 
days later and sent home to recuperate 
airlines generally pick up the travel expenses insurance covers 
most of the medical costs 
now her doctors in texas want to draw blood once instead of 
twice a week because her veins are collapsing from so many tests 
but they cant because of her rising enzyme levels its to the 
point where its getting kind of frustrating we dont really know 
whats going on said mrs purcell 
if i remember they told me after the first five years youre 
over the hump they didnt tell me it went downhill 
stormie is just as bewildered as her mother 
shes to the point where its really bothering her mrs 
purcell said if her liver is in rejection one more time shes 
going to tell dr starzl she wants a new liver thats getting 
pretty desperate when you dont want to try the new medication 
its something i never thought id hear her say 
starzl doesnt intend to give stormie another liver and her 
heart wont need to be replaced even if her liver does her heart 
is doing perfectly in all this he said the liver is doing 
quite well we think well keep that liver for the foreseeable 
future 
stormie suffered from a rare congenital disease that increased 
the cholesterol in her blood to nearly 10 times normal the 
imbalance was caused by a faulty liver she had two heart attacks 
two triple coronary bypasses and a heartvalve replacement before 
starzl decided in january 1984 to replace her heart and liver 
on feb 14 1984 during 16 hours of surgery stormie received 
the heart and liver of a 4yearold new york girl killed in a car 
accident she was discharged as an outpatient that march and sent 
home in may 
encouraged by her progress surgeons did two more heartliver 
transplants during the next year in pittsburgh the worlds leading 
transplant center but both patients died within a few days of 
surgery 
those were the sole attempts in america at replacing heart and 
liver in a simultaneous operation until dec 3 when pittsburgh

ten florida panthers are about to be chosen for a 
new life that may have extraordinary consequences for the survival 
of the species 
a captive breeding program has been approved by federal and 
state officials to boost the declining population from an estimated 
30 to 50 in the wild 
there are certain purists that say let them die a natural 
death out in the wild said john christian of the fish and 
wildlife service we need to consider their views but on the 
other hand we are charged with preventing the extinction of the 
species and moving toward its recovery 
wildlife managers say the panther is in nowhere near the danger 
of the california condor or the blackfooted ferret when their 
entire populations were rounded up for breeding but dennis jordan 
the fish and wildlife services panther coordinator said its 
no question the population is stressed 
when you get down to a total population numbering 30 to 50 
animals you get into a situation of facing the brink of 
extinction we consider we have one viable sustaining population 
now in south florida and none anywhere else 
the nocturnal cougar subspecies growing to 60 to 130 pounds is 
smaller and darker than most cougars and has a distinctive tail 
crook and a cowlick in the middle of its back its a solitary 
hunter favoring deer and small game and needs lots of room at 
least 40 square miles for a female and more than 200 square miles 
for each male with little overlap 
the panther once ranged from louisiana to south carolina but 
hunting and development have pushed it into the everglades and 
undeveloped south florida interior without intervention experts 
say it will vanish within 40 years 
the goal of the program is 500 breeding adults in captivity and 
three wild colonies in 20 years using hightech influences such as 
radiotelemetry collars and possibly even in vitro fertilization 
and embryo implants 
with captive breeding four founders adults at the top of 
distinct family trees and six kittens chosen for their bloodlines 
will be captured and sent to miamis metrozoo the private white 
oak plantation tampas lowrey park zoo or the jacksonville zoo in 
march or april big cats in captivity tend to be prolific breeders 
but researchers have no solid experience with panthers 
panthers will be captured for six years descendants of the 
first batch captured could be freed to the wild in three to seven 
years through a halfway house that would teach them to hunt 
again a team of state wildlife workers already checks about 15 
cats equipped with radio collars each year 
once the cats are chosen they will be chased up a tree and 
tranquilized the sedated cat will then be roped and lowered to the 
ground cushioned against injury by an air bag during medical 
exams the cats will be kept under a tent to protect them from the 
sun the breeding cats then will be taken to a central station for 
evaluation and eventually to their new zoo homes 
everybody has philosophical views about these kinds of things 
im sure everyone would like to see the cat do well in the wild 
said larry thompson southeast regional vice president of the 
national audubon society but short of that what were going to 
have to do is bring some of the cats in and carry through with this 
phase of planning 
captive breeding is only one step in a wideranging program to 
revitalize the panther population a national cancer institute 
researcher is doing genetic kinship studies the national zoo is 
experimenting with in vitro fertilization in domestic cats state 
guidelines for oil and gas development and hunting regulations have 
been modified to protect the panther culverts have been built 
under interstate 75 to keep the cats off the road across the 
everglades and intense monitoring of the wild population will 
continue 
the uniqueness of this plan for panthers is we still have this 
wild population said tom logan the state wildlife research 
program coordinator this is not a situation where we have to do 
it or were going to lose them in the next year or two in other 
words a laststep effort 
were a step ahead of the game

the barriers to eliminating guinea worm disease 
a disabling infection that strikes 10 million people a year mostly 
in africa are political and financial not technical us health 
officials say 
in addition theres a failure to recognize the opportunity 
that exists to get rid of the disease the centers for disease 
control says 
guinea worm disease dracunculiasis occurs in 16 african 
countries india and pakistan and is transmitted through drinking 
water contaminated with larvae of the guinea worm nigeria alone 
reported more than 650000 cases in 1988 the last year for which 
statistics are available when ingested larvae can mature in the 
stomach or intestinal tract becoming worms up to 47 inches long 
after incubation of about a year they emerge through the skin 
usually in the legs 
the result is intense pain and incapacitattion for up to three 
months although recovery is usually complete some patients can be 
left permanently disabled if joints are affected by the worm or 
associated infections 
the disease can be prevented by filtering boiling or chemically 
treating water the major thrust of eradication is to teach people 
how to treat their water not trying to overhaul the third worlds 
sanitation systems overnight said dr robert kaiser head of the 
cdc division of parasitic diseases 
the approach in the long term is providing safe and adequate 
supplies to everyone but this is a costly longterm kind of 
goal he said there are more immediate and easier approaches 
to the problem that are less costly

most people are not born with a taste for salt 
but by adulthood its hard to imagine eating without it 
it tastes good and it makes food taste better by enhancing 
other flavors it also is hard to avoid since half the salt many 
people eat is hidden in processed foods 
if you have already been diagnosed as having high blood 
pressure you probably have been told to watch your salt intake 
not everyone is affected by salt and even eliminating it wont 
eliminate the threat of high blood pressure but it cant hurt to 
back off a little from the salt shaker 
table salt is 40 percent sodium and 60 percent chloride the 
national research council of the national academy of sciences 
suggests that a daily intake of one to three grams of sodium is a 
safe and adequate range for adults thats one to 1 teaspoons 
of salt 
the average daily consumption now is estimated at four to six 
grams 
it is difficult to eat a diet resulting in a sodium deficiency 
most people can function normally and indefinitely with less than 
two grams the american heart association says just four ounces of 
corn chips and a large sour pickle would fill the bill 
sodium is needed to attract water into the blood vessels and it 
helps maintain normal blood volume and pressure we get most of our 
sodium from sodium chloride or table salt with some from souces 
such as monosodium glutamate msg and sodium bicarbonate water 
and some foods also naturally contain small amounts of sodium 
its easiest to reduce salt intake gradually and many people 
find that once they grow accustomed to less salt their taste for 
it diminishes 
some steps are fairly easy make the food taste good so you 
dont feel the urge to add salt always taste food before adding 
salt 
a dash of vinegar sometimes can make up for salt in soups or 
main dishes try lemon juice instead of salt in water for cooking 
pasta be aggressive with herbs and spices leave the salt out when 
making hot cereal use unsalted butter or margarine 
make stock without salt and even if you add some when making 
soup its controlled 
read labels at the supermarket consumers will find sodium used 
as a preservative as well as for flavor in canned soups and 
vegetables processed meats and cheeses frozen and canned main 
dishes many condiments and other foods 
an item labeled as no salt added is not necessarily 
saltfree 
sodiumfree means an item has less than 5 mg of sodium per 
serving very low sodium means less than 35 mg 
low sodium means 140 mg sodium or less per serving 
reduced sodium means the usual sodium level has been 
reduced by 75 percent through processing

vector aeromotive corp is trying to define a new 
segment of the american automobile market the companys chief says 
they include ferraris lamborhinis and his very own vector w2 
performance collectables is what gerald a weigert 
president and chief executive officer of wilmington califbased 
vector calls these hyperpowered cars 
theyre not for everybody indeed some people wonder why anyone 
would buy them 
these are california types who want to have something nobody 
else has said auto analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities 
co international inc in new york city 
i dont place much stock in these people who buy it just to 
have it she said 
but people do buy them and they pay handsomely for the 
privilege makers of the cars are proud of their products 
folks who go to the chicago auto show which opens saturday 
will have a chance to take a look at the 250000 vector w2 and 
the lamborghini diablo which will go for a little less when its 
available in the spring 
put those two cars on the starting line along with a ferrari 
testarossa each poised to roar off to 60 mph within 5 seconds and 
theyd make the stuff car buffs dream about 
these are not cars for preschool shuttles or a swing by the 
market for a gallon of milk hence the collectable angle says 
weigert 
this automobile is not a consumer product he said it is 
an experts product 
the specifications on the vector testarossa and diablo can awe 
some auto enthusiasts although they may be mindnumbing for 
average drivers 
zero to 60 mph in less than 5 seconds means that from a 
standing start the cars can be breaking the law on most us 
highways in less time than it takes most phones to ring three times

as scuba diver mike nelson on televisions sea 
hunt actor lloyd bridges wore a wet suit to ward off the oceans 
chill 
more than 25 years later bridges role in an investmentfraud 
lawsuit is bringing predictions of a chill in the use of celebrity 
endorsements 
the actors lawyers on wednesday announced the settlement of a 
case in which although he denied any liability bridges was cast 
as potentially liable for claims against an investment company that 
he represented in television commercials 
no trial was held but a judges ruling on a pretrial motion 
and a similar ruling by a judge in a related case indicated 
celebrities could be held liable for misrepresentations when 
endorsing a product or service 
the fact that a celebrity is merely reading a script may no 
longer be an excuse said dan formeller one of the lawyers who 
represented bridges 
another bridges attorney jacqueline criswell said the 
willingness of the courts to hold celebrities and ad agencies 
liable in such cases will have a chilling effect 
in the end the risk associated with celebrity endorsements 
may not be justified by the rewards she said 
but at least one advertising expert predicted that holding 
celebrities accountable for the integrity of products they endorse 
could encourage companies to use more celebrity spokespeople 
because consumers will be more likely to trust them 
too many viewers today dont believe celebrities because they 
think that if you pay a guy a million dollars hell say anything 
said al ries chairman of the marketing consulting firm trout amp 
ries in greenwich conn 
this is making the game honest ries said 
the bridges settlement concluded a lawsuit that also pitted 
actor george hamilton and a detroit advertising agency against 
investors allegedly bilked by two michiganbased mortgage 
companies aj obie amp associates and its parent diamond mortgage 
inc 
bridges was a television spokesman for obie and hamilton 
represented diamond in television ads in the early 1980s 
both companies declared bankruptcy in 1986 and two of their 
executives were sentenced to prison in 1988 in michigan after 
pleading either guilty or no contest to fraud charges 
terms of wednesdays settlement with 11 investors were not 
disclosed the investors lost hundreds of thousands of dollars and 
will be getting a portion of their money back said lawyer 
stephanie canwit whose firm represented the plaintiffs in us 
bankruptcy court here 
bridges lawyers said the actor was not available for comment 
bridges denied any liability as did hamilton and yaffe amp co 
the advertising firm that created the ads in previous settlements 
but during the 3year course of the case judge robert ginsburg 
denied the defendants motion for dismissal indicating in his 
ruling that celebrities could be held liable for misrepresentations 
when pitching a product or service 
the judge said celebrity endorsers must take reasonable steps to 
ascertain that their statements in an advertisement are true 
ginsburg based his decision on an august 1987 ruling by us 
district court judge milton shadur of chicago who rendered a 
similar opinion in a related case against the same defendants 
which also was settled before trial 
stephanie canwit a lawyer for the investors called the lawsuit 
a groundbreaking case that established new law in the area of 
fair advertising 
its the principle of advertising substantiation she said 
you have to look before you leap

in hockeycrazed minnesota where television 
rights to the state high school tournament cost 15 million 
making money with a professional team would seem as easy as 
shooting into an empty net 
but after wading in red ink for nine of the past 12 seasons 
minnesota north stars owners gordon and george gund are ready to 
move the national hockey league club to california 
its hard to figure said john bartz associate director of 
the minnesota state high school league which oversees competition 
among 143 varsity hockey teams i think minnesota has been 
regarded as one of the premier hockey states and not to have a 
professional hockey team would be a real disaster 
but it may be close to being reality the gunds say they have a 
tentative agreement to move to oakland and also have been invited 
to move rentfree to a 100 million arena being built in san jose 
for the 199293 season 
the gunds say a move is imminent unless the public commission 
that controls the met center the teams home since joining the nhl 
in 1967 spends 15 million to add skyboxes and other 
revenuegenerating facilities 
in addition the gunds are demanding better corporate support 
to the tune of an additional 6000 season tickets 
i think its closer to a move than not moving north stars 
coach pierre page said wednesday theres no smoke in the air 
its not a threat 
bill lester executive director of the metropolitan sports 
facilities commission said his staff is exploring options to keep 
the north stars but he has called the gunds feb 21 deadline 
unrealistic and has said the commission has no more than 1 
million to spend on the met center 
gordon gund says the issue is simple the north stars need 
better facilities at the 23yearold arena in suburban bloomington 
and a larger seasonticket base to compete against the redhot 
minnesota timberwolves of the national basketball association 
the timberwolves have only 10 wins in their maiden season but 
they lead the nba with an average attendance of 24600 and have 
14800 seasonticket holders 
the north stars in contrast sold just 3800 season passes and 
are drawing an average of only 11000 people a game more than 
3500 under the nhl average 
a lot of the corporate community has turned its attention to 
supporting an nba team and in the process they werent paying as 
much attention to us gund said 
more irksome to gund is the commissions penchant for spending 
money on the downtown metrodome where the baseball twins football 
vikings the timberwolves and university of minnesota football 
teams play 
among other items the commission has earmarked 6 million to 
expand press facilities at the dome for the 1992 super bowl and 
ncaa basketball final four 
the commission hasnt put a dime into met center gund said 
weve spent 20 million and were through putting money into it 
the commission hasnt invested much in the met center because it 
gets little in return says carrolyn anderson a commission member 
besides paying less than 170000 a year in rent the north stars 
control all revenue from parking concessions and special events 
i dont think the sorts of improvements they are talking about 
are going to make or break the hockey team anderson said the 
overall trend indicates that if you have a fairly good hockey team 
youre going to have good attendance 
thats been a problem for the north stars who made it to the 
stanley cup finals in 1981 and havent been close since 
after a hot start this season theyre 24293 and fighting to 
hold onto a playoff berth theyve failed to make the playoffs in 
two of their last three seasons and posted losing records in four 
of the past five 
attendance has fallen in all but two of the past 10 seasons 
leaving the north stars in poor position in the twin cities market 
a sevencounty area of about 18 million people that has four major 
pro sports franchises 
this certainly raises a big issue in everybodys mind said 
larry wipf an economist at minneapolisbased norwest bank just 
how many discretionary dollars are out there 
thats a big question and we need to know the answer right 
away gund said it would be very hard for us to leave but the 
oakland area is hungry for professional hockey and its a much 
bigger market with about 5 million people 
a move to oakland would complete a circle for the gunds and the 
north stars the gunds were minority owners of the oaklandbased 
california seals in the early 70s the seals who lost millions in 
nine seasons in oakland moved to cleveland in 1976 with the 
gunds bailing out owner mel swig a year later 
the gunds wound up with a controlling interest in the north 
stars when the two teams were merged in 1978

laundering money from cocaine sales and a host 
of other criminal activities represents a 300 billion worldwide 
business each year but could prove the drug trades key area of 
vulnerability a senate report said today 
because money laundering is principally accomplished through 
the use of legitimate financial institutions money laundering is 
the potential achilles heel of the illegal drug business said 
the report from two senate panels 
the report released by sen john f kerry dmass was based on 
testimony before the senate foreign relations and banking 
committees last fall 
it attributed to assistant treasury secretary salvatore martoche 
the estimate that worldwide drug revenues total 300 billion 
annually including 110 billion generated in the united states it 
said laundering all of this cash presents tough problems for 
criminals 
for example 100 billion in 20 bills a denomination often 
used in drug transactions would weigh 26 million pounds the 
report said a money laundering operation in new york shut down 
earlier this year required a tractortrailer to haul away 19 
million in small bills it said 
it said the 1970 bank secrecy act is working as a deterrent to 
money laundering through american financial institutions the 
measure requires the institutions to report cash deposits of 
10000 or more 
the report said however that drug traffickers continue to 
use foreign banks and foreign branches of us banks to launder 
us drug profits 
it said switzerland canada the bahamas luxembourg panama and 
hong kong are among the main countries where money is laundered it 
also said criminals are pushing to develop money laundering centers 
in a number of tiny countries ranging from andorra to vanuatu 
the report said illicit funds are sometimes accepted in large 
cash deposits by corrupt bank employees it said funds sometimes 
are laundered through seemingly legitimate businesses that appear 
to generate substantial amounts of cash and often they are 
transferred to foreign banks that are not overly curious about the 
source it said 
after the money has gone through one or more wash cycles it 
can be transferred into a legitimate american business the report 
said 
the report said part of the scandals that have shaken the 
savings and loan industry in the united states involved thefts by 
organized crime organizations 
significant funds generated from sampl theft have been laundered 
beyond us borders through offshore bank secrecy havens the 
report declared these funds now represent an enormous endowment 
devoted to the support of organized crime 
it said the success of efforts to stem money laundering through 
american banks has turned launderers toward unregulated financial 
institutions such as money transmitters checkcashing stores and 
currency exchanges 
the report said the government currently has no policy on 
control of international electronic transfers of us funds 
as a consequence money launderers retain a choice of methods 
to conceal their laundered funds through international wire 
transfers including informal channels involving fax machines 
telex personal computer networks and ordinary telephone 
instructions which do not leave the paper trail which would allow 
investigators to follow the flow of funds it said

a wellintended change aimed at curbing 
reckless and dishonest savings and loans is also choking off credit 
to some builders industry representatives complain 
sampl bailout legislation enacted in august sharply reduced the 
limit on how much an institution can lend to one borrower from 100 
percent of net worth to 15 percent the provision took effect 
immediately with no transition period 
the availability of thrift funds for housing has been abruptly 
curtailed martin perlman president of the national association 
of home builders said wednesday 
many builders in the final stages of preparation for a project 
have been left without funds to start while others have been left 
in limbo about whether an existing loan will be renewed he told 
the house banking oversight subcommittee 
he said 31 percent of the builders surveyed at the groups 
annual convention in atlanta last month reported receiving notice 
that their sampl was cutting back on future loans 
banks cope with the limit by selling off pieces of large loans 
to other banks but sampls are inexperienced at the technique and 
developers say they are being turned down for loans at sampls that 
for years have been reliables sources of funds 
members of the panel and officials from banking agencies and the 
department of housing and urban development offered sympathy but 
little prospect for relief 
we are seeing healthy home builders around the country being 
turned away by healthy savings associations we in congress 
created a catch22 situation that threatens the survival of solvent 
thrifts and of thriving home builders said rep carroll hubbard 
dky chairman of the subcommittee 
hubbard said analysts indicate 500000 units of new housing 
could go unbuilt over the next five years he said in some cases 
builders will get the loans but at a higher interest rate a cost 
that will be passed on to consumers 
however the chairmen of both the senate banking committee and 
the house banking committee have said they oppose overhauling the 
sampl bill this year and hubbard said i am not proposing to 
amend the sampl law 
housing and urban development under secretary alfred a 
dellibovi said his department has been trying to ease the strain on 
builders by having secondary mortgage market agencies fannie mae 
and freddie mac buy development and construction loans from sampls 
but he said any relief will be limited and he urged sampls to 
develop networks of other institutions to participate in big loans 
officials of both the office of thrift supervision which 
regulates sampls and the office of the comptroller of the currency 
which regulates nationallychartered banks said the law leaves 
them with no discretion to delay the effective date of the new 
standard

the administration hopes to complete by early 
may a ussoviet trade pact that presidents bush and mikhail 
gorbachev can sign at their scheduled summit meeting a month later 
the first round of talks on what would be the first attempt for 
an economic accord with the soviets since the early 1970s will open 
here monday us trade representative carla hills said 
through these negotiations we hope to encourage economic 
reform within the soviet union as it moves toward a more 
marketdriven economy mrs hills told the senate finance 
committee wednesday 
the panels chairman sen lloyd bentsen dtexas warned mrs 
hills any accord reached with the soviets could run into trouble on 
capitol hill if lawmakers arent consulted along the way 
bentsen expressed anger he was not advised beforehand by 
administration officials that bush would promise gorbachev a new 
round of trade talks at their malta summit meeting in december 
president nixon signed a trade agreement with the soviets in 
1972 but it was never ratified by the senate 
if the nixon administration had consulted with congress i 
dont think the bush administration would have the kind of 
limitations it has on it now bentsen said im deeply 
concerned that we dont see a repetition of that 
the talks follow mutual pledges by bush and gorbachev to 
accelerate a normalization of ussoviet trade and economic 
relations in response to the wave of democratic reforms sweeping 
the soviet bloc 
as part of the accord which has to be approved by congress the 
united states would waive the 1974 jacksonvanik provisions that 
now require the soviets to pay several times the normal tariffs 
charged most other countries on their exports to us markets 
a successful agreement will also create opportunities for us 
businesses to expand trade and commercial activity with the soviet 
union mrs hills said 
the us negotiating team will be led by deputy us trade 
representative julies katz the head of the soviet team is yuriy 
chumakov deputy minister of foreign economic relations 
administration officials envision the accord removing a 300 
million ceiling on loans and loan guarantees from the us 
exportimport bank to finance soviet purchases of american exports 
other expected provisions include relaxing restrictions on 
hightech exports and reversing us opposition to loans and loan 
guarantees from the international monetary fund and world bank 
in addition us capital investments in the soviet union could 
become eligible for the first time for insurance protection from 
the overseas private investment corp similar opic restrictions on 
hungary and poland were lifted as part of an aid bill last fall 
mrs hills said the administration will seek protections for 
us businesses in the accord including safeguards from import 
surges protection of intellectual property rights such as patents 
and copyrights and greater freedom to do business in the soviet 
union

police officials said today they plan to send 
investigators to europe next week to try to trace the source of 
bogus japanese gold coins with a face value of 71 million japans 
biggest counterfeiting case ever 
a police spokesman however declined to reveak the 
investigators destination 
japans kyodo news service said the investigators would go to 
switzerland from which japanese coin dealers had imported 103000 
gold coins all believed to be fakes since march 1988 
the counterfeit coins were first discovered late last month when 
a company tried to deposit a batch with a bank police said more 
fake coins have been found since then including a cache found in 
the vault of the bank of japan the countrys central bank the new 
york times reported today 
the counterfeits are of a 100000yen or 687 coin issued by 
japan in 1986 and 1987 to commemorate the 60th year of emperor 
hirohitos reign hirohito died in january 1989 
the fake coins like the real commemorative ones are made of 
gold but because the commemorative issue sells for almost 2 times 
the value of the gold content in the coins counterfeiting could 
prove lucrative 
the huge number of the commemorative coins issued is another 
factor said koichiro ishihara managing director of the monthly 
coin magazine published in tokyo it would make a challenging 
job for the authorities to find the fakes among millions of coins 
in circulation 
the bank of japan issued 10 million of the commemorative coins 
in 1986 and an additional 1 million coins the following year 
a bank of japan official said the fakes like the genuine coins 
each contain 20 grams or twothirds of an ounce of pure gold 
worth about 40000 yen or 278 based on open market prices for 
gold gold closed at 41810 an ounce on the new york commodity 
exchange wednesday 
still the price of the commemorative coins remains set at 
100000 yen 
the first counterfeits were found on jan 29 when taisei stamp 
and coin co of tokyo presented 1000 coins for deposit at a branch 
of fuji bank in downtown tokyo 
taisei executives told police that the company had imported the 
coins through paul davis 38 a british coin dealder based in 
london for 98000 yen each 
police investigators then found that rimpac gold co and daruma 
international galleries both of tokyo had imported a total of 
102000 such coins through davis and another european coin dealer 
between march 1988 and january this year 
we suspect all these coins to be bogus the police spokesman 
said adding that the authorities have yet to verify that 
police have said some 8000 of the 103000 coins were checked 
last week and all were found to be bogus the forged coins had 
slight flaws on both surfaces visible only by microscope they 
said 
a fuji bank official said last week he felt the fake coins were 
lighter in color than genuine ones otherwise he said they looked 
and weighed the same as real coins 
it was not known immediately how many of the imported coins have 
been sold to private investors in japan 
davis came to tokyo last friday to answer police questions 
police officials said wednesday davis maintains that he only acted 
as a middleman and he still believes the coins are genuine

new york city has filed a multimilliondollar 
lawsuit against exxon corp over a 567000gallon oil spill from a 
pipeline into the arthur kill waterway mayor david dinkins said 
the exxon oil spill is a disaster that could have been 
prevented should have never happened and has permanently scarred 
the environmental landscape dinkins said wednesday 
the lawsuit filed in state court seeks a 10 million fine 
reimbursement to the city for cleanup costs and full restoration 
of the kill a waterway between staten island and new jersey and 
adjacent wetlands 
the lawsuit also alleges fraud on the part of exxon at least 
once every three months from jan 1 1984 through the third 
quarter of last year for submitting reports to the fire department 
that an oil pipeline and leak detection system were working 
properly said corporation counsel victor kovner 
exxon has admitted publicly that for approximately the last 12 
years the leak detection system has frequently signaled a leak 
when none existed the lawsuit said 
it said exxons repeated prior claims that it had been 
successfully tested suggests that exxon had a policy and practice 
of disregarding the truth 
exxon spokesman douglas walt said the company was disappointed 
because it has been participating with 10 city state and federal 
agencies in negotiations aimed at addressing the concerns outlined 
in the citys lawsuit 
we continue to hope that these discussions will result in the 
development of a mutually agreeable plan that will eliminate the 
need for the lawsuit and in no way are we backing away from this 
effort walt said in a statement we have provided a definitive 
study plan and have been waiting for a response 
dinkins had indicated early last month that he hoped the city 
would not have to sue exxon which he called new yorks corporate 
neighbor and that the company would commit itself to reimbursing 
the city for its costs 
kovner said wednesday that exxon had assured the state it would 
pay for costs for which it was liable but that it did not make a 
clear commitment to pay for damages to the city 
the lawsuit said the spill continues to contaminate the waters 
of the arthur kill adjacent kill van kull and other streams 
creeks and rivers and caused the death of an increasing number of 
waterfowl

delta air lines northwest airlines and trans 
world airlines announced the completion of an agreement to form a 
new company that will operate a global computer reservations system 
the three airlines announced plans to establish the system last 
september 
joe krovisky spokesman for the antitrust division of the us 
justice department in washington said wednesday the division 
notified all parties on tuesday that it did not intend to challenge 
the deal 
the agreement will merge deltas datas ii reservations system 
with the pars system jointly owned by twa and northwest delta also 
is paying twa 48 million for a 6 23 percent portion of pars 
giving it the largest share of the new company 
delta will own 40 percent of the new company northwest will own 
33 13 percent and twa will hold the remaining 26 23 percent the 
companies said in a statement 
krovisky said he did not have information on what distinguished 
this deal from one last june proposed by american airlines and 
delta to merge their reservation systems the department said then 
an americandelta deal would substantially lessen competition and 
that the government would sue to block it 
the two airlines then dropped the idea 
american and delta claimed at the time they were blindsided by 
the justice department after crafting their deal to meet possible 
antitrust concerns for instance they had planned to sell up to 
half the equity in the venture to other carriers 
american was said to have 41 percent of the market and 445 
million in revenue in 1988 for its sabre reservations system while 
delta had 7 percent and 68 million in revenue for datas ii the 
smallest airline reservation system 
a 1986 regulation says airlines must not favor their own flights 
in computer displays but the department said travel agents tend to 
sell a disproportionately high number of tickets on the sponsoring 
airline

baby dolls that dirty their diapers and a 
30something barbie show toymakers arent taking many chances this 
year with costly creations that must compete with video games in a 
notoriously fickle industry 
analysts and executives say the multibillion dollar business is 
largely sticking with the tried and true while supplementing 
lineups with new additions that have builtin insurance because 
they are based on film characters entertainers or existing toys 
with proven popularity 
there are people in the industry who are saying that 
creativity is going down says gerald v cleary president of the 
tonka products division of tonka corp to some degree there may 
be some truth to that i think the reason for it is the risk 
associated with product launches 
the old classics and newcomers will be competing for attention 
when the toy industry hosts its annual bash beginning monday the 
10day extravaganza draws buyers worldwide who hope to spot the 
next big craze or at least the probable sellers 
familiar faces in the form of barbie gi joe plus other widely 
known dolls and action figures will get prominent billing 
oldtimers life and monopoly will share the game spotlight with 
newer entries such as one that made a splash last year shark 
attack 
hype ranging from a fifth avene parade of teenage mutant ninja 
turtles to appearances by reallife superstars are some of the 
weapons toymakers are using to outdo each other in generating 
publicity 
despite the high jinks and hyperbole industry analysts predict 
a hohum year in toyland 
sales in the 13 billion industry excluding the wildly 
successful video game segment rose about 5 percent in 1989 says 
the toy manufacturers of america inc sponsor of the 87th annual 
american international toy fair the trade group will release 
official figures the first day of the show which features more 
than 1100 exhibitors 
i think 1990 will continue the trend that began in 1987 of 
conservatism said gary m jacobson a toy analyst at kidder 
peabody amp co i think industry revenues will be up modestly in 
1990 i look to 1991 and the decline of video to free up some 
dollars for traditional toys 
nintendo still reigns among systems that turn televisions into 
game screens but a more sophisticated and expensive machine 
genesis from rival sega did well over the holidays indicating the 
market hasnt peaked 
new software titles will be introduced aimed at keeping the 
video game business booming sega provided previews of one starring 
michael jackson that inserts slick dance moves into a game plot 
analyst paul valentine of standard amp poors corp says themes of 
recent years will be repeated and embellished miniatures dolls 
stuffed animals and videogame accessories are categories of 
concentration toys for preschoolers too young for nintendo 
will be emphasized 
dolls will proliferate theyll range from hightech babies who 
eat and cry to hasbro incs baby uhoh who wets herself after a 
bottlefeeding and even suffers simulated diaper rash 
highfashion model dolls resemble the real thing matchbox toys 
bevy of christie brinkley cheryl tiegs and beverly johnson dolls 
may put a few worry wrinkles in 31yearold barbies brow 
a strong 1990 contender could be tyco toys incs 45 my pretty 
ballerina said to be capable of toe dancing even executing an 
arabesque or pirouette tycos oopsie daisy crawled and stumbled 
her way to stardom last year 
small has been beautiful for the balance sheets of some 
manufacturers particularly lewis galoob toys inc which is 
extending its mico machines line that has been racing ahead of 
mattel incs hot wheels and matchboxs vehicles 
galoobs success with miniatures has inspired others to downsize 
their toys hasbro for example has decided to offer petite 
versions of its famous my little pony herd 
some toymakers are banking on licensing agreements as tickets to 
financial rewards hasbro the countrys biggest toy company 
already announced its agreement with the pop music group new kids 
on the block the quintet teenybopper sensation is spawning dolls 
puzzles and other items 
by going after a deal with a hot group hasbro showed gumption 
something the toy industry must have more of if it intends to 
regain market share gobbled up by video games and other competitors 
for toy dollars analysts say 
i think the traditional us manufacturers are going to have 
to become aggressive to make inroads against video and to stimulate 
sales jacobson of kidder peabody says 
lawrence bernstein president of hasbros toy division says the 
company is pursuing a new strategy we will be far more 
aggressive in our approach to new products than we have been in the 
past 
for years toy manufacturers have been criticized for playing it 
too safe while waiting for the videogame fad to fade which in some 
respects seems to be a selfperpetuating problem 
the rising cost of creating new offerings and plugging them with 
expensive tv commercials has made toymakers conservative but 
retailers who obviously want to stock winners typically prefer to 
order toys promoted on tv 
nonetheless companies willing to take risks can make a killing 
if their toys catch on playmates toys inc proved that with the 
teenage mutant ninja turtles the third hottest selling toy in 1989 
after nintendo and mattels barbie 
about two dozen more turtles new enemies and accessories will 
come out in 1990 and probably will get a boost this easter from the 
film starring live actors 
playmates a subsidiary of hong kongbased playmates holdings 
ltd has done so well with the turtles which are based on a 
comic that it was able to land what is expected to be a lucrative 
license it won the rights to action figures based on the dick 
tracy movie from walt disney studios starring warren beatty and 
madonna the film opens june 15 
richard sallis senior vice president for playmates recalls 
that when the idea for the turtle figures came up the company 
jumped on it despite the risk of a flop 
i looked at the market four years ago and felt a lot of people 
werent doing anything they werent taking any chances he said 
when people arent doing anything there are a lot of 
opportunities

crews floated containment booms 
into place today to protect a wildlife preserve and beaches from a 
slick of more than 290000 gallons of oil spilled from a tanker 
that may have gashed itself on its anchor 
the 811foot american trader fully loaded with 21 million 
gallons of heavy alaskan crude tore a 3foot hole in a compartment 
wednesday as it was mooring at an offshore pipeline terminal 1 
miles from shore the coast guard said 
the spill occurred just off huntington beach a city about 30 
miles south of los angeles long popular with surfers and sunbathers 
and often the scene for movies and tv shows featuring surfing 
the slick hovered about a mile from several beaches and a marsh 
this morning but desert winds condensed it from a fourmilelong 
plume into a roundish milelong blob and were pushing it away from 
shore officials said 
its good because its a smaller area for us to corral 
said coast guard petty officer mark kennedy but the farther it 
gets offshore the harder it will be to get it out of the water 
calm seas worked to the advantage of cleanup crews who worked 
under spotlights overnight using oilcontainment booms and skimmer 
boats 
a dozen oilfouled birds found on the beach were taken to a 
cleaning station but half died officials said they were 
completely drenched in the oil youd pick them up and drops would 
come off said christina amato a volunteer 
those wetlands and wildlife preserves are so very precious 
said dorothy green president of heal the bay a local 
environmental group 
a diver found a hole in the bottom of a forward compartment that 
held more than 1 million gallons of crude said coast guard capt 
james card no other damage was found on the vessel which was 
operated by american trading transportation co of new york and 
leased by british petroleum oil shipping co usa 
the coast guard initially reported the tanker had struck a 
submerged pipeline but american trading president sanford schmidt 
said the captain speculated that the vessel was punctured by one of 
its anchors as it was maneuvering at less than 1 mph 
schmidt said the ship sitting 40 feet deep in the water had 
dropped two anchors off the bow and eased backward into a nest of 
buoys but he said there was speculation that a swell caused the 
front of the ship to lift up and one of the anchors to swing loose 
coast guard cmdr scott porter assistant chief of marine 
safety couldnt confirm the account he said the cause of the 
spill remained under investigation 
the tanker captain robert laware and the first mate were 
tested for alcohol and drugs but results were not immediately 
available officials said 
oil containment booms were set around the tanker protective 
booms were set at the bolsa chica wildlife preserve alamitos bay 
anaheim bay santa ana river and upper newport bay coast guard lt 
vince campos said 
coast guard officials expected the crude would foul huntington 
city beach huntington state beach bolsa chica state beach 
we cant boom all the beaches off but well at least key 
those key areas campos said 
the crude was the same type that fouled alaskas prince william 
sound last year when more than 10 million gallons spilled from the 
exxon valdez porter said 
sen pete wilson rcalif and other political leaders seized 
the accident as evidence of the need for stricter regulation of oil 
industry operations in coastal waters 
wilson noted that the spill was much smaller than the exxon 
valdez spill but he added the difference is that here its 
going to impact an enormous audience youve got a densely 
populated coastline and incidentally one that is environmentally 
sensitive

japanese banks may have a lions share of the 
international banking business but they now must come to grips 
with the same problems that hammered many big us banks in the 
last decade bad third world loans rising interest rates and a 
potential downturn in their domestic real estate market 
its clear the japanese banks will be pressured to take on a 
more philanthropic role simon smithson an analyst with 
kleinwort benson securities said of japans third world debt 
exposure some hard decisions will have to be made 
japanese banks now constitute the worlds 10 biggest on basis of 
assets partly due to growth stemming from the booming japanese 
economy of the 1980s and the rise of the yen against the dollar 
as they grew so did their international business including in 
such areas as developing country loans that now are seen as 
potential trouble spots 
in recent years us banks have restructured a significant 
portion of their loans to many latin american countries while 
beefing up reserves for covering bad loans and writing down the 
value of some credits those actions directly reduced profits 
japanese banks generally have a lower overall exposure to third 
world debt than do us banks with latin american loans accounting 
for an estimated 3 percent to 6 percent of commercial banks 
outstanding loans however their reserves for covering bad loans 
also are relatively small 
major american and british banks have reserves to cover as much 
as 80 percent of their outstanding third world loans japanese 
banks are just now raising their reserves to 25 percent from 15 
percent by the end of march 
japanese banks also are set to take an earnings hit by writing 
off a portion of their medium and longterm loans to mexico 
following a recently approved debt restructuring agreement between 
mexico and 450 creditor banks 
japan also has potential loan problems on the domestic front 
smithson said trust banks loans to corporations and commercial 
banks loans to individuals for real estate could be hit hard by a 
major downturn in the overheated japanese property market 
many of the loans those banks make are ultimately for real 
estate and could become irrecoverable he said 
concern over tokyos inflated land prices reaches into many 
sectors of the economy the rate of increase has slowed since 1987 
when land prices grew 70 percent to 24 percent in 1988 and 27 
percent in the first six months of 1989 leading some analysts to 
conclude that prices could soften or fall 
reflecting uncertainty over japans overheated property market 
moodys investors service inc this week downgraded its credit 
ratings for japans three largest trust banks mitsubishi trust 
and banking corp sumitomo trust and banking co and mitsui trust 
and banking co 
land in tokyos highestpriced residential area actually did 
fall in the first half of last year by 44 percent from a year 
earlier the national land agency reported in an averagepriced 
tokyo neighborhood a square foot of residential land costs 630 
according to a survey last spring by the association of real estate 
appraisal 
but tokyos commercial land prices continued to edge up last 
year the most expensive commercial property cost 23600 a square 
foot last year up from 22500 the previous year the national 
land agency said land prices in lessdeveloped suburbs also 
continued rising it said 
richard koo senior economist at nomura research institute said 
falling land prices right now would have limited impact on bank 
assets 
japanese banks use extremely conservative accounting methods 
sometimes using the actual acquisition price from 20 years ago 
so even a 30 percent decline in land prices wouldnt do that much 
damage he said 
analysts say a more immediate danger lies in rising interest 
rates which have begun to cut into banks already slim profit 
margins 
japans central bank raised its discount rate or the interest 
it charges to commercial banks three times last year to 425 
percent from 25 percent the rate hikes helped push other interest 
rates higher 
higher rates discourage real estate investment by making 
borrowing more expensive they also reduce the differential between 
lending and borrowing rates that constitutes a banks profit

the new york times co reported thursday it lost 
19 million in the fourth quarter citing regional economic 
weakness and previouslydisclosed charges involving its forest 
products investment and costs of staffing reductions 
for the year the media concern said its profit climbed 59 
percent principally because of a big gain on the sale of its cable 
television system 
the company said its loss in the fourth quarter amounted to 24 
cents a share in contrast to earnings of 504 million or 64 cents 
per share in 1988 
fourthquarter revenue rose 44 percent to 4702 million from 
4500 million a year earlier 
the company said the weak new york regional economy reduced 
advertising lineage by 56 percent for the quarter at the new york 
times its flagship newspaper 
the latest results also reflected a charge of 57 cents a share 
for the establishment of a valuation reserve against the companys 
investment in its forest products group and costs of voluntary 
staff reductions at the times 
the fourthquarter results also were reduced by 11 cents a share 
in the quarter due to structuring costs associated with its recent 
acquisitions of mccalls golf world us and sailing world 
magazines and by 3 cents a share as a result of a legal settlement 
with independent home delivery dealers 
the company said that excluding the special factors earnings 
per share would have been 47 cents in the fourth quarter 
operating profit for the newspaper group which includes the new 
york times 35 regional newspapers and a onethird interest in the 
international herald tribune fell 63 percent to 251 million for 
the quarter reflecting decreased ad linage at the times and the 
staff reduction and delivery dealer charges 
the magazine group had an operating loss of 126 million in the 
latest quarter in contrast to an operating profit of 53 million a 
year earlier the loss was due to the structuring charge higher 
subscription promotion expenses and single copy circulation 
softness in the first quarter at family circle 
the broadcasting and information services group had an operating 
profit of 29 million in the quarter compared with 4 million a 
year earlier reflecting a writedown of firm and syndication rights 
the company had an equity loss of 251 million on its 
investment in its forest products group as a result of the charge 
for the valuation reserve it had equity earnings of 81 million 
in the same quarter a year ago 
for the year the company earned 2666 million or 339 a 
share up from 1677 million or 208 a share a year earlier 
the results included a gain of 1933 million after taxes on the 
sale of its cable tv system 
revenue for the year rose 4 percent to 18 billion from 17

britains highest court of appeal ruled against 
bordens inc thursday in a battle over the right to sell lemon 
juice in squeezable containers 
the law lords britains highest judiciary body upheld a 
previous high court ruling that bars borden from selling its 
plastic lemons filled with reconstituted lemon juice in britain 
because shoppers could confuse bordens realemon with a similar 
british product jif 
borden issued a statement from its headquarters in new york 
saying the firm disagreed with the decision but would abide by it 
jifs manufacturer reckitt and colman won an injunction three 
years ago barring borden from marketing realemon in any container 
so nearly resembling the jif lemonshaped container 
borden had argued that it would be impossible to compete without 
causing initial confusion because jif was the only product of its 
kind in the british market 
the judge disagreed and said that if the borden product were 
packaged differently put in a box or shaped like a lemon segment 
the problem would be solved 
its unfortunate that uk consumers will not be able to make 
their choice in the marketplace based on price and quality of 
competitive and conspicuously labeled products bordens 
statement said 
the threeyear legal battle is believed to have cost the two 
companies 25 million in legal fees 
lord bridge one of the five judges who heard the case said 
reckitt and colman had been given a de facto monopoly in 
naturalsized plastic lemons 
a trader selling plastic lemons would never be permitted to 
register a lemon as his trade mark but reckitt and colman have 
achieved the result indirectly that a container designed to look 
like a real lemon is to be treated per se as distinctive of their 
goods he said 
bridge said he would have liked to avoid this result but he 
could not fault the legal reasoning and agreed with the other 
judges in dismissing bordens appeal 
another law lord lord jauncey said he did not believe that 
jifs makers were being given a monopoly the ruling he said 
merely meant that borden had not taken adequate steps to 
differentiate its package from that of reckitt and colman so 
consumers would not be deceived 
borden said it would continue to sell its lemon product in 
bottles in britain and throughout europe and its lemonshaped 
containers in france and norway

houstontotoyko route choosing the houstonbased carrier over 
five other applicants 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner has 90 days to either

american airlines from boston through san jose calif aloha 
airlines from los angeles through honolulu america west airlines 
from phoenix ariz through honolulu returning via las vegas and

to japan and other points in the far east the texans told skinner 
houston is our nations fourthlargest city and the largest 
city in the south and southwest region the congressmen said

a federal judge handed georgiapacific 
corp a victory in its bid to buy great northern nekoosa corp 
ruling thursday that it will take just a twothirds vote by great 
northern shareholders to oust the paper companys directors 
great northerns bylaws called for a threefourths vote but 
us district judge gene carter agreed with georgiapacific that 
the higher number ran afoul of maine corporate law 
the judge also struck down two other portions of great 
northerns bylaws which allowed outgoing directors to name a new 
board and called for a 90day nomination period for new directors 
were disappointed and we certainly are going to study what 
he had to say and then well decide how to react to it great 
northern spokesman stephen m hill said from his office in norwalk 
conn where the company is based it is incorporated in maine 
great northerns board has been fighting the 38 billion 
takeover attempt but georgiapacific succeeded in forcing a 
special shareholders meeting scheduled for march 2 in portland at 
which the great northern directors could be thrown out 
hill declined to predict whether great northerns directors 
would be able to survive the shareholders meeting 
atlantabased georgiapacific contends that great northerns 
directors are resisting the takeover offer so they can hold onto 
their highpaying jobs at the expense of shareholders 
despite thursdays setback for great northern the company still 
hopes to persuade carter to block georgiapacifics effort to oust 
the great northern board 
the judge plans to hear oral arguments monday on that motion by 
great northern which also hopes to block the hostile tender offer 
on grounds that include allegations that georgiapacific has 
violated federal securities laws by covering up plans to sell maine 
assets should the deal go through 
t marshall hahn jr georgiapacifics chairman and chief 
executive officer issued a statement hailing the ruling 
this is one more important advance in bringing georgiapacific 
closer to completing this acquisition which we believe is best for 
great northern shareholders employees and communities in which 
they operate hahn said 
georgiapacific has denied great northerns allegations that it 
broke the law by covering up plans to sell maine assets saying 
that it has no such plans

the federal communications commission on 
thursday reversed a yearold policy allowing white knight 
applicants to gain broadcast licenses saying such 11thhour 
resolutions encourage sham applications 
an attorney representing a group that challenged the 
commissions dec 23 1988 decision to approve a settlement 
agreement for a new fm station in marco fla said thursdays 
action suggests a more aggressive regulatory posture under new fcc 
chairman alfred sikes 
this is an absolute uturn on a policy adopted by the 
reaganera fcc a year ago said andrew schwartzman executive 
director of the media access project 
schwartzmans group appealed the fccs approval of a pact in 
which rowland gulf radio inc which was not an original applicant 
for the new station license paid off one of the applicants 
affirmative broadcasting to substitute rowlands name on the 
application 
in return rowland paid off the other six competing applicants 
the fcc said 
the rationale behind the white knight approach which the 
commission first adopted in the marco case during the chairmanship 
of dennis r patrick was to avoid lengthy and costly comparative 
application hearings in which a number of competing parties try to 
prove theyre the most worthy applicant 
the fcc said the white knight approach could get stations on the 
air more quickly thus better serving the public interest 
but the fcc said it was granting reconsideration of its own 
motion disapproving the marco agreement and reopening the license 
proceeding because it was concerned that approval would encourage 
the filing of sham applications conceived only for the purpose of 
entering into profitable settlement agreements 
the commission said it found that although approval of the marco 
settlement would expedite service to the public this was 
outweighed by the fact that approving the marco agreement would 
create an economic incentive for individuals with no real interest 
in building and operating broadcast stations to file sham 
applications in future cases 
schwartzman said thursdays decision was a very important 
policy reversal that will impact a very substantial number of 
pending cases around the country it signals again that the 
sikes commission is going to take a much more aggressive stance on 
regulatory issues 
schwartzman who had appealed to the fcc on behalf of the united 
church of christs office of communications and two florida 
residents said the white knight method amounted to a private 
auction 
it enables the least qualified possible applicant to get the 
station as long as theyre rich enough to buy off the better 
qualified applicants schwartzman said 
the fcc in the early 1980s legalized unlimited payoffs between 
competing applicants which critics said led to a flood of 
frivolous and sham applications by parties not really interested in 
operating stations 
in march 1989 in a move designed to reduce the number of 
nuisance applications from profiteers the fcc banned all 
settlement payments prior to an initial licensing decision by the 
commission and limited payments after a license hearing to 
legitimate expenses incurred by the withdrawing applicant 
the applicants for the florida license were rebecca radio of 
marco emerald sea broadcasting inc affirmative broadcasting 
corp showcase communications inc marco minority associates 
susan g and william r gaston and marco skywave inc

bluechip stock prices posted some small gains 
thursday but prices finished narrowly mixed in the broader market 
as a strong morning rally eroded in the afternoon 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which was up 3378 
points on wednesday rose another 428 to close at 264437 the 
markets bestknown index had been up more than 22 points shortly 
before noontime 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by a narrow margin in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
768 up 696 down and 505 unchanged the nyses composite index fell 
022 to 18409 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 17624 million 
shares down from 18671 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 21072 million shares 
stock prices moved higher for most of the morning pushing the 
dow jones industrial average up 2230 points as of 1130 am est 
but profittaking drove prices steadily lower in the afternoon 
and the dow jones industrial average dropped below wednesdays 
closing level in the final hour of trading before rallying once 
again at the close 
some analysts said the market is still showing the scars of a 
big selloff in january which saw the dow drop from a peak of more 
2800 early in the month to about 2543 on jan 30 
in the seven sessions since then the market has recovered more 
than 100 points as measured by the dow jones industrial average 
the market was ready to get off its back and was able to get 
up on one knee but it was not ready to jog around said bill 
raftery a vice president in the technial research department at 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
the stock market has been preoccupied this week by the 
treasurys 30 billion auction of new securities and its potential 
impact on interest rates 
rising interest rates hurt stocks because they make yields more 
competitive on fixedincome securities and raise the costs of 
borrowing to buy stocks 
bidding was strong for the first two phases of the auction 
which involved sales of 10 billion each in threeyear and 10year 
notes 
but thursdays auction of 10 billion in 30year bonds the last 
part opf the threestage auction failed to go as well 
the bond were sold for an average yield of 850 percent and 
there were fewer than 2 in bids for every 1 in bonds sold 
some stock market watchers said the end of the borrowing spree 
may bode well for stocks no matter how the last stage of the 
auction went 
gene jay seagle vice president and director of technical 
research at gruntal financial inc in stamford conn said the 
market is headed up to 2700 on the dow jones industrial average 
we are running into a little profittaking here he said 
but i think the market is entitled to some kind of hesitation 
with the bond refunding program out of the way after today the 
market wont have that obstacle in its way and we can test above 
the 2700 level

but a new york citybased consumer and environmentalist group 
said ceasing production of disposable cameras would have been a 
better step toward helping ease the nations garbage problem 
its one step in the right direction but not nearly enough 
said steven romalewski who wrote a consumer products guide for the 
new york public interest research group 
the 20page guide published last month singled out products 
for what nypirg said were the worst examples of disposable 
overpackaged and nonerecyclable consumer products kodaks fling 
was included in the guides top 10 list 
we are committed to finding acceptable ways to reduce the 
amount of waste either incinerated or going into landfills peter 
m palermo kodaks vice present and general manager of the 
consumer imaging division said in a news release 
the recycling program will be extended to europe and other parts 
of the world next year kodak said late last year the photography 
giant announced a recycling plan for the plastic canisters in which 
35mm film is packaged

federated department stores inc treasurer 
mark kennedy told a us bankruptcy court judge thursday that 400 
million in bank credit is needed to prevent the retailers collapse 
kennedy said federated did not have enough cash to keep 
operating another 30 days he said federated had been rejected by 
other lending institutions and that the loan arranged through a 
citibankled syndicate is needed to keep the company functioning 
us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr in a daylong hearing 
that continued into thursday evening heard federated officials 
testify in support of the companys petition for the financing 
federated and allied stores corp the us department store 
chains held by torontobased campeau corp are operating under 
chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors while they 
attempt to work out a plan to pay their huge debts 
the bankruptcy judge must approve major company expenditures or 
other business deals 
aug has scheduled a similar hearing friday to consider approval 
for a 300 million loan allied negotiated with a group led by new 
yorkbased chemical bank 
federateds lawyers said the citibankpromised loan agreement 
will not be available if approval is not obtained by the feb 14 
deadline imposed by the banks about 100 banks are participating in 
the syndicate and more than half of them are foreign institutions 
lawyers for the banks have said 
the federated unsecured creditors committee opposes the loan 
the committee says federated does not need the money and has enough 
cash on hand the creditors say the borrowing would only increase 
the corporations interest payments 
kennedy testified federated officials believe that if approval 
of the credit is denied they will lose the little leverage they 
have to negotiate a loan 
kennedy testified i think its absolutely critical the 
existence of the loan is mandatory to reestablish our credibility 
in the eyes of our creditors a headline which says federated 
dip rejected would have a disastrous effect referring to the 
socalled debtorinpossession financing 
federated and its fellow campeau corp retailing subsidiary 
allied stores corp filed chapter 11 reorganization petitions jan 
15 to obtain bankruptcy court protection from creditors while 
financing plans are developed 
in filing for chapter 11 protection federated listed 77 
billion in debts amassed when campeau bought the retailers both 
headquartered in cincinnati 
allied and federated operate 260 stores and employ a combined 
100000 people 
under cross examination thursday kennedy said federated has 
250 million cash on hand but he said that would disappear and the 
company would likely fail if it were forced to spend all its cash 
to buy merchandise 
creditors contended there is no need for some of federateds 
profitable store chains to be included in the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
case 
lawyers for the creditors committee provided statements at 
thursdays hearing showing that new yorkbased bloomingdales 
miamibased burdines and atlantabased richs all had net worths of 
more than 1 billion 
our concern is longterm when the debtors reach a point 
when they need to build substantial inventories in the fall and 
winter the vendor community will not be inclined to meet the 
substantial needs of the debtor said lewis rosenbloom a lawyer 
for the creditors committee

federal securities regulators are exploring 
what to do about a kind of investment scheme known as a blank 
check blind pool that often victimizes small investors a senate 
panel was told thursday 
blank check blind pools are public stock offerings in which the 
issuer doesnt spell out how it plans to use the money raised 
critics of such pools charge they are often sham corporations 
brought to the marketplace as vehicles for shady purposes 
they were discussed by several witnesses testifying before the 
securities subcommittee of the senate banking housing and urban 
affairs committee which is looking at ways to protect small 
investors from penny stock fraud and other scams 
we need more tools to combat the problem susan e bryant 
administrator of the oklahoma securities department told the panel 
which was chaired by sen richard h bryan dnev 
last week bryan introduced a bill to protect small investors 
the bill which would allow the securities and exchange 
commission to bar such blank check blind pools from registering 
their securities contained provisions sought by the sec to beef up 
their enforcement powers 
last week sec chairman richard c breeden said he wanted the 
ability to to issue cease and desist orders against suspected 
wrongdoers without having to go to courtm first 
breeden also said congress should affirm federal judges rights 
to bar repeat securities law offenders from serving as officers or 
director of public companies 
on the blank check blind pool richard ketchum head of the 
secs division of market regulation conceded it is a vehicle 
that has been used for fraudulent activity particularly the penny 
stock market more and more frquently 
but he and joseph i goldstein head of the secs penny stock 
task force cautioned that clearer definitions were needed 
goldstein said he has asked the sec division of economic 
analysis to study the issue to see if further regulatory steps 
should be taken 
fraud involving penny stocks lowcost highrisk securities 
trading for as little as a penny a share is estimated to cost 
american investors 2 billion a year 
its very very hard to recover it said goldstein adding 
that the most effective defense against penny stock fraud is an 
educated investor 
penny stocks which are usually not listed on any stock exchange 
or national stock quotation system are not illegal and often not 
fraudulent but the scarcity of information about them and the 
limited amount of surveillance they come under make them prone to 
numerous fraud schemes 
one victim who managed to recover most of the 17000 she and 
her husband lost to a penny stock fraud artist said the experience 
was devastating 
losing the money was terrible being lied to and misled by 
people we thought we could trust was worse said debra thomason 
a secretary from elberton ga 
her husband bobby an electrician said the senators might 
wonder how the couple got in such a fix 
the only thing i can tell you is that we trusted these people 
just the same way you trust your doctor or you would trust your 
mechanic if you took your car in and he said you needed brakes 
youre not going to sit there and argue with him thomason said

researchers said thursday they have 
discovered a new electrical power source that could replace 
traditional rechargeable batteries to supply emergency backup power 
the system is a small fuel cell that converts gas to electricity 
using thin films 
bellcore scientist christopher dyer who discovered the process 
compared it to a solar cell but said it is powered by gases 
instead of sunlight 
he described it as a very clean power source that is fueled 
by hydrogen and oxygen leaving water as the only byproduct 
however the applications are limited until the device can be 
increased in size bellcore the research arm for several regional 
telephone companies is looking for manufacturing partners 
the thumbsize laboratory prototype generates electricity when 
hydrogen or other fuel gases are blown over two electrodes 
separated by a thin membrane in the presence of oxygen 
it could replace batteries if we could make it somewhat bigger 
than what we have dyer said adding that a fuel cell does not 
need to be recharged like a battery fuel cells run as long as 
there is a constant supply of gas 
dyer said bellcore acquired a patent for the device last fall 
a description of the experiment appears in the feb 8 1990 
issue of nature a prestigious london science journal 
the announcement was made by bellcore a research group for the 
seven baby bell regional phone companies ameritech bell 
atlantic bellsouth nynex pacific bell southwestern bell corp

the generic pharmaceutical industry 
association said thursday that it had formed a panel of independent 
experts to examine the governments drug approval process in the 
wake of the generic drug fraud and bribery scandal 
the seven medical legal and pharmaceutical experts will make 
recommendations for changes to reassure the american people that 
generic drugs are properly evaluated and safe and effective said 
lewis a engman a washington lawyer heading the committee 
there are clearly some bad apples that have been uncovered 
said engman a former chairman of the federal trade commission and 
a former president of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association 
committee members will talk to people in the generic drug 
industry and the food and drug administration and others to try 
to get a handle on the scope of these problems he said 
the scandal in the 7 billion generic drug industry became 
public last spring and led to bribery convictions of three generic 
drug company executives and bribetaking convictions of three fda 
employees 
the investigations also uncovered evidence that some drug 
companies cheated on tests required to win fda approval and 
prompted recalls of dozens of generic drugs including the 
lowerpriced versions of some popular drugs 
in one case recalls of two generic products have left 
smithkline beechams antihypertension drug dyazide one of the 
most widely prescribed drugs in the country without any generic 
competition 
bolar pharmaceutical co inc last week withdrew its version 
because it appeared false documents had been used to support the 
companys claims for the product last summer vitarine 
pharmaceuticals inc withdrew its generic from the market last 
summer after admitting it substituted samples of the brandname 
drug for its product in potency tests 
in another development thursday an fda source said bolar 
temporarily suspended distribution of all products last friday 
while company officials discusses with the fda a list of products 
the agency wants to audit 
the products are narrow therapeutic range drugs which work 
within a smaller range of potency than most drugs the source said 
bolar officials did not return telephone calls seeking comment 
jere goyan a committee member who headed the fda from 197981 
and is now dean of the school of pharmacy at the university of 
california in san francisco said he does not believe there is a 
major flaw in the fdas process for approving generic drugs 
all of the drugs that have gone through the approval process 
that havent been switched have certainly measured up and are 
therapeutically equivalent to the innovator product he said 
the committee hopes to complete its work within six months he 
said 
the fda and the justice department are continuing their 
investigations into generic drug approvals as is a house 
subcommittee which uncovered the original evidence of impropriety 
a committee within the department of health and human services 
which includes fda is conducting review of fda operations

senate leaders said thursday they were close 
to agreement with the bush administration on compromise clean air 
legislation but environmentalists charged the closeddoor talks 
were weakening the bill too much 
key senators and administration officals have been meeting for 
more than a week in an attempt to craft an air pollution control 
package that will avert a divisive floor fight 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said that while the 
talks were making progress in key areas differences remained 
over how much to toughen automobile emissions standards to reduce 
urban smog 
mitchell who had hoped a compromise package could be agreed 
upon this week said he now has ruled out an agreement before the 
upcoming weeklong congressional recess 
environmentalists charged that the bill approved by the 
environment and public works committee last november was being 
watered down under intense pressure from the white house 
theyre not talking about any strengthening amendments only 
weakening ones said richard ayres executive director of the 
clean air coalition an umbrella group of environmental and public 
health organizations 
the public health is being negotiated away charged dan 
weiss who has been following the clean air debate for the sierra 
club 
mitchell said he expected the criticism but said criticis 
should evaluate the final product against current law the 
maine democrat said substantial progress was being made and that he 
was optimistic a compromise bill that will greatly tighten federal 
air pollution controls could be worked out 
we are making progress agreed sen bob dole rkan the 
senate minority leader but dole said there continued to be deep 
concerns from some senators over the cost of new pollution 
controls especially requirements cutting acid rain which would 
hit a string of midwest states the hardest 
this is not a partisan measure said dole adding that 
opposition and support of the legislation depends on where you 
live 
the senate leaders said that tentative agreements had been 
reached with the administration over controls of industrial toxic 
chemical releases and on contols of smog pollutants on businesses 
and industries in heavily polluted urban centers 
but mitchell said differences continued over provisions that 
would impose tough pollution controls on automobiles after the year 
2003 the administration has called the requirements too expensive 
and argues that a requiring phasing in alternative fuel cars in 
heavily polluted urban areas would be cheaper and as effective 
mitchell said the discussions would resume after the congress 
returns from its presidents day recess feb 20 and that he hoped 
that floor votes on a compromise bill could begin a few days later 
were very close to an agreement much more than 
threefourths agreement said sen max baucus dmont the 
bills democratic floor manager 
but even if a compromise is reached neither mitchell nor dole 
said they could rule out attempts by some senators to stall the 
legislation with a filibuster 
a group of senators largely from the midwest have threatened a 
filibuster if some cost sharing arrangement cannot be worked 
out to ease the expense of complying with expensive acid rain 
provisions especially in the midwest where most of the dirtiest 
plants are located 
both mitchell and the bush administration have ruled out a 
national energy tax or fee to share such costs although some other 
form of cost sharing such as increased emission credits for the 
dirtiest electric power plants continued to be discussed 
cost sharing in the customary sense of a fee or tax is 
dead said baucus

chinas industrial output fell a sharp 61 
percent in january from a year earlier following a 10 percent drop 
in december according to an official report 
the state statistical bureau in a report carried by the 
official china daily friday attributed the big drop mainly to the 
chinese lunar new year holiday which was marked in february in 
1989 but fell on jan 27 this year 
the lunar new year is chinas biggest holiday and most 
enterprises shut down for three or four days 
but the decline also continued the trend of stagnating economic 
growth that has persisted since mid1989 when a tough government 
austerity program instituted shortly after the june political 
crackdown began to take effect on the economy 
industrial output rose 68 percent in 1989 over the previous 
year but fourthquarter growth was only 07 percent and output in 
october fell 21 percent from the level of october 1988 the first 
monthly decline in a decade 
economists have estimated that up to a third of chinese 
factories have had to suspend or reduce production because tight 
credit policies have left them without operating funds and a 
downturn in demand has led to overstocking and poor sales 
the bureau said industrial output totalled 1278 billion yuan 
272 billion in january with light industry dropping 85 
percent to 62 billion yuan 132 billion and heavy industry 
falling 35 percent to 658 billion yuan 14 billion 
staterun enterprises produced 884 billion yuan 188 
billion down 65 percent and collectively owned firms 341 
billion yuan 726 billion down 71 percent small private firms 
produced most of the rest 
the bureau also said production of most consumer goods fell as a 
result of the continued slump in the retail sales market 
refrigerator production was down 585 percent from a year 
earlier washing machines were down 476 percent color televisions 
393 percent bicycles 373 percent and automobiles 447 percent
