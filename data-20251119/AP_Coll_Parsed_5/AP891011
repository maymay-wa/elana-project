the state department expressed concern 
wednesday about a new crackdown by panamanian authorities on civil 
liberties while president bush tried to end the recriminations 
with key members of congress that followed last weeks failed coup 
attempt 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said a package of war 
laws is being decreed by the the panamanian government as part of 
an effort to eliminate the last vestiges of democracy and rule of 
law 
as an example she said civil servants could be fired for 
disloyalty under the new measures being planned and the right of 
habeas corpus is to be eliminated 
these war laws purportedly will strip panamanians of their 
remaining civil liberties and human rights she said 
meanwhile bush summoned sen david boren dokla the chairman 
of the senate intelligence committee and sen william cohen 
rmaine the vice chairman following a week of congressional 
criticism about the way the administration handled the abortive 
uprising 
in a statement issued afterward boren indicated that the 
meeting was designed in part to avoid a repeat of the snafus that 
occurred during the abortive uprising last week in panama 
i feel that our discussion which focused on intelligence 
matters will be of great help to our country if we ever confront 
crises like the panama situation in the future boren said 
afterward boren flew to oklahoma and was unavailable to elaborate 
on his statement 
wednesday night bush brushed off any hint of bad feeling over 
the congressional criticism he got on the panama matter saying 
criticism was to be expected always and said he had an amiable 
meeting with boren and cohen 
there was never any bad blood he told reporters at a state 
dinner in honor of italian president francesco cossiga 
im not angry he said in response to reports that he 
heatedly chastised his staff and laid down the law that there was 
to be no more secondguessing 
bush predicted that as the smoke clears people will agree with 
him i have no second guesses at all he said 
administration officials have said that poor communications and 
confused signals contributed to the failure of the coup attempt 
wednesdays meeting occurred three days after boren and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft clashed over whether senate 
restrictions inhibited the administrations ability to fulfill its 
goal of ousting noriega 
vice president dan quayle said the meeting with the senators 
concluded with everyone on the same wave length i believe it was 
a very good productive meeting 
but on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell 
aimed new criticism at the administration for seeking to blame its 
inaction on congressionally imposed constraints 
the efforts by some within the administration to shift 
responsibility for decisions to the senate intelligence 
committee are illfounded unfair and counterproductive said 
mitchell dmaine 
it is legitimate he said for congress to inquire into how 
the administration could have been so unprepared when what it had 
long been urging took place 
at the state department ms tutwiler denied assertions by some 
rebel leaders who have been given sanctuary in florida that the 
insurgents were promised much more support by the united states 
than was actually given 
she specifically denied that the rebels had asked for us air 
support to prevent the airlifting of pronoriega reinforcements to 
panama city after the coup attempt got under way 
ms tutwiler said that secretary of state james a baker iii was 
disturbed by unnamed state department officials quoted in newspaper 
accounts as being critical of other agencies involved in the events 
last week in panama 
she said baker told a staff meeting last friday he wanted to see 
a stop to such criticism 
meanwhile seven latin american presidents meeting in peru 
discussed the proposed expulsion of panama from an eightmember 
hemispheric consultative group 
panamas membership was suspended in 1988 after noriega arranged 
the dismissal of president eric delvalle who had tried to fire 
noriega as military commander 
peru and venezuela are among members pushing for panamas 
expulsion 
we cannot permit a country like panama that scoffs at and 
ridicules the democratic system to contnue with us said 
guillermo larco cox perus foreign minister 
diplomatic sources said mexico and some others felt expulsion 
would amount to interference in the internal affairs of another 
country

the executive board of unesco recommended wednesday 
that the palestine liberation organizations request for admission 
to the agency be put off until 1991 
the recommendation goes to unescos highest decisionmaking 
body the general conference which begins a monthlong meeting 
tuesday 
if the conference takes the boards advice as appears likely 
unesco will be following the footsteps of the world health 
organization which decided in may to put off considering whether 
to admit palestine 
the plos parliamentinexile from its headquarters in tunis 
tunisia last nov 15 declared palestine as an independent state 
without giving specific boundaries 
the united states which withdrew from unesco nearly five years 
ago had said it would not consider returning if palestine were 
admitted as a member state 
at the world health organization meeting in geneva the united 
states had threatened to withhold paying its contribution to the 
budget which amounts to 25 percent 
the resolution approved by the unesco board without debate or a 
vote called for close involvement of the palestinians in activities 
of the 159nation united nations educational scientific and 
cultural organization 
the palestinian observer at unesco omar massalha said the plo 
decided to accept the recommendation for postponement in order to 
spare the agency any political confrontation over the issue 
unesco directorgeneral federico mayor has made a determined 
effort to get the united states britain and singapore to rejoin 
the world body 
the americans and british left because they said the 
organization had become too political spent too much money and was 
poorly managed singapore pulled out saying it could spend its dues 
better elsewhere 
the resolution calls for the closest possible participation of 
palestine in the action of unesco in particular through its 
programs and full benefits of the scholarship programs 
it says the palestine observer mission now can make requests to 
participate in unesco programs directly instead of going through 
the arab league as it has in the past 
mayor has drawn up an 82page study for the board outlining ways 
the palestinians can become involved more closely in unesco 
activities

held him captive briefly said one of the coup leaders seeking 
political asylum here

was capt javier licona believed to be the highestranking coup 
participant to escape capture said a bush administration official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
were working with the immigration service so that they can 
remain here those that want to file for asylum mark franken 
a refugee coordinator for the us catholic conference said 
wednesday i expect that will take about a week 
adela bonilla de giroldi widow of the major who led the 
unsuccessful coup also was among those airlifted to miami she 
told the new york times the coup was betrayed by another officer 
who switched sides at the last minute 
she said her husband maj moises giroldi vega had worked with 
maj francisco olechea commander of the elite battalion 2000 in 
planning the coup 
battalion 2000 instead of fighting noriega was airlifted 55 
miles from the fighting and led noriegas troops to crush the coup 
everything was ready but olechea was playing a winners game and 
he failed to come through because of his cowardice she told the 
times in a miami interview 
franken said the panamanians flown into miami have told him they 
want to remain in seclusion for now but administration officials 
are said to be attempting to get more information from the leaders 
secluded here

oct 3 the rebels held noriega hostage for several hours and could 
have killed him at any time the miami herald reported wednesday 
the rebel who spoke on condition that neither his name nor the 
location where he was interviewed be disclosed said his troops 
knew him as commandante trueno commander thunder 
he said junior officers who took part in the coup attempt turned 
noriega over to their superiors but that leaders of the rebellion 
had no desire to kill the general 
there was no intention at any time to kill the man 
commander thunder said 
when asked why he said it may have been because a soldier would 
find it hard to execute his top commander it may have been their 
military discipline he said 
mrs giroldi told the times that three captains who were 
supposed to persuade noriega to surrender didnt do it because 
they were cowards 
my husband could have killed noriega but he would not do 
that he thought the commanders fate should be decided by the 
people not the united states she told the paper 
in their public proclamations the rebels said they had staged 
the coup to retire noriega and five senior colonels of the 
panamanian defense forces 
with commander thunder were about a dozen other rebel troops

were in the group state department spokesman rich sanders said he 
would not confirm whether the group included giroldis widow adela 
bonilla giroldi a key intermediary between us officials and the

gen manuel antonio noriega accused 
the united states on wednesday of trying to keep its forces in 
panama to maintain control over latin america 
the widow of the panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coup 
against noriega says it failed because her husband was betrayed by 
another major who switched sides at the last minute according to a 
published report 
noriega who blamed last weeks coup attempt on the united 
states said panama must be prepared because they cannot catch us 
by surprise again and even if the commander noriega falls the 
people will not fall 
countering what us officials have been saying adela bonilla 
de giroldi was quoted by the new york times in thursdays editions 
as saying the coup was very well organized and coldly 
calculated 
she said her husband maj moises giroldi vega worked with maj 
francisco olechea commander of the elite battalion 2000 in 
planning the coup 
instead of being used to oust noriega however battalion 2000 
was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led 
noriegas troops in crushing the coup 
everything was ready but olechea was playing a winners game 
and he failed to come through because of his cowardice she told 
the times in an interview in miami 
mrs giroldi was not at military headquarters during the coup 
attempt on oct 3 and her information came from officers who took 
part in the coup and as she did fled shortly afterwards to the 
united states the times said 
noriega spoke in panama city at the peoples power assembly 
before he addressed the crowd he introduced sarah york 11 a 
negaunee mich girl on her second trip to panama at noriegas 
invitation 
she represents the truth of the american people purity and 
not hatred he said as he brought his young pen pal to the podium 
to wave to the crowd 
the assembly is comprised of precinct representatives appointed 
by the government to act as a legislative body it replaces the 
national assembly which was abolished when the provisional 
government of president francisco rodriguez took office on sept 1 
the government annulled may 7 elections which foreign observers 
say the opposition won by a 31 margin 
noriega who commands the defense forces and controls the 
government said washingtons intention was not just to eliminate 
him but to install in power the enemies of the people 
rodriguez spoke after noriega he called for reconciliation and 
said his government was open to dialogue 
on tuesday the government announced tough new measures aimed at 
suppressing dissent firing public employees considered to be 
disloyal freezing wages and suspending yearend bonuses 
members of the assembly demanded dismissal of seditious 
elements still working for the government 
but rodriguez who was frequently rumored to have opposed the 
laws during cabinet meetings said the measures should not be used 
for personal revenge 
the preservation of the country as our home is and must be the 
paramount goal of our government rodriguez said 
opposition leaders and members of professional associations 
expressed concern over impact of the new laws which the government 
said were meant to protect the economy and national security in 
the face of us aggression 
it is the first step in the creation of a police state 
christian democratic party leader ricardo arias calderon told the 
associated press 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington wednesday that panama was decreeing a package of war 
laws as part of an effort to eliminate the last vestiges of 
democracy and rule of law 
panama blames washington for its troubles the us government 
imposed economic sanctions on panama after noriega was indicted in 
february 1988 on us drug charges he denies the charges 
wednesday was the 21st anniversary of the military coup that 
brought to power the late omar torrijos the man noriega considers 
his political and ideological mentor 
the coup deposed president arnulfo arias 11 days after arias 
took office torrijos banned political parties exiled scores of 
politicians and ruled with the help of a peoples assembly instead 
of congress 
torrijos signed treaties with president carter that committed 
the united states to a new relationship with panama 
the united states gave up its territory in the canal zone in 
1979 under the treaties the united states must close its panama 
bases at the end of the century when panama will take over the 
canals administration

police action against cocaine suppliers is 
futile unless the united states and europe reduce the demand that 
drives the illicit trade president carlos andres perez of 
venezuela said wednesday 
perez spoke on opening day of a summit of seven latin american 
presidents in this desert city that also is to consider expelling 
panama as the eighth member of the group of eight regional 
organization 
panamas membership was suspended in 1988 after gen manuel 
antonio noriega arranged the dismissal of president eric delvalle 
who had tried to fire noriega as military commander 
the venezuelan leader called noriegas military rule a masked 
dictatorship president alan garcia of peru used his opening 
remarks to express publicly the peruvian peoples and the 
peruvian governments repudiation and condemnation of the military 
dictatorship 
peru and venezuela were expected to push for expulsion of 
panama but diplomatic sources said mexico and some other members 
felt that would amount to meddling with the internal affairs of 
another country 
among items on the summits agenda besides drug trafficking are 
central americas conflicts foreign debt and environmental damage 
to the amazon jungle 
in his remarks on the drug trade peres said the more demand 
grows in the north the more production will grow in the south 
police actions will be useless unless demand is reduced 
other opening statements also expressed support for peru 
colombia and bolivia which argue that president bushs emphasis on 
attacking the cocaine traffic at the source is not enough 
the summit began the day after presidents garcia virgilio barco 
of colombia and jaime paz zamora of bolivia invited bush to attend 
a drug summit in latin america within 90 days bush accepted 
immediately 
paz did not remain for the group of eight meeting because 
bolivia is not a member garcia and barco were joined by perez of 
venezuela carlos salinas de gortari of mexico jose sarney of 
brazil carlos menem of argentina and julio sanguinetti of uruguay 
at the third summit since the regional organization was formed in 
1987 
the meeting is being conducted in closed session at the hotel 
las dunas on the outskirts of ica a city of 350000 people 185 
miles southeast of lima officials said earlier that the meeting 
would last three days but late wednesday shortened the meeting to 
two days without giving a reason 
an army battlion of 300 soldiers guarded the hotel and 3000 
plaincothes policemen circulated in the city in case of attacks by 
shining path a maoist guerrilla group that began fighting peruvian 
governments in 1980 the insurgency has cost 15000 lives by 
government count 
a car bomb police blamed on shining path exploded tuesday night 
outside an auto parts store in residential lima wounding a guard 
and blowing out the windows of the shop and nearby buildings 
police said rebels also shot and killed a woman candidate for 
deputy mayor of a lima district tuesday night firing three bullets 
into her head as she stood behind the counter of her pharmacy 
official reports said 26 other people were killed in seven 
incidents tuesday night and wednesday including nine policemen 
two mayors and two rural mayoral candidates 
diplomatic sources at the summit said the presidents were 
expected to give full support to peru colombia and bolivia in 
their fight against traffickers colombia began a crackdown on 
cocaine gangs aug 19 
on tuesday barco garcia and paz promised allout war on 
cocaine in their countries which produce 90 percent of the worlds 
supply 
their communique stressed that stopping the cocaine trade must 
be accompanied by vigorous efforts against production and 
consumption 
that reflects reservations in latin america about bushs 
emphasis on police and military actions to stop trafficking in the 
andean nations 
president sanguinetti of uruguay told reporters before the 
summit began wednesday the problem is not only in medellin it 
is also in the streets of new york city 
his reference was to the medellin drug cartel which has been at 
war with the colombian government since the crackdown began in 
august 
the threenation communique did not elaborate on differences of 
approach but peru bolivia and colombia have requested more us 
economic aid to provide alternative sources of income for hundreds 
of thousands of peasants who live by growing coca the raw material 
for cocaine 
its not a problem of donating some helicopters sometimes 
very old helicopters or donating rifles or bullets garcia said 
recently it would be enough to offer a good price and a 
guaranted market for the products that could substitute for coca 
he barco and paz also said european leaders should attend the 
drug summit garcia has said that if the united states is 
successful in slowing the flow of cocaine across its borders 
traffickers will shift their focus to europe

nearly two centuries after napoleons 
forces routed them the knights of malta are returning to the 
island they got from an emperor in exchange for a falcon and ruled 
for 268 years 
the monks in armor will be here oct 1722 for a gathering 
their leadership hopes will help bolster maltas economy 
officially named the sovereign military order of the hospital of 
st john of jerusalem of rhodes and of malta the knights are the 
oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in 
the roman catholic church 
they ruled this rocky and almost barren mediterranean 
archipelago from 1530 when emperor charles v gave it to them for 
the price of one trained falcon a year until 1798 when napoleon 
sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during 
centuries of plundering the ottoman empire 
fra andrew bertie the 78th grand master of the 900yearold 
order has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help 
malta improve its economy 
for centuries membership in the knights required proof of 
generations of nobility although some ranks today are open to 
those without noble ancestry the rolls are still crowded with the 
wealthy and influential 
the new york financier j peter grace is a member as are former 
us secretary of state alexander m haig premier giulio andreotti 
and president francesco cossiga of italy and giovanni agnelli 
chairman of the italian automobile company fiat edward bennett 
williams the washington attorney and owner of the baltimore 
orioles major league baseball team who died in august 1988 also 
was a member 
such men are one reason the orders maltese association asked 
bertie to call the knights back to malta which in 25 years of 
independence from britain has found the economic road as rocky as 
its coastline 
bertie a longtime former resident of malta encourged knights 
worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and 
openly solicited their help 
i also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly 
interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the 
economic life of the island to do so bertie told the knights 
earlier this year in new york 
roger de giorgio president of the maltese association of the 
ancient order now based in rome said about 500 of the 10000 
members are expected to travel to malta 
we want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about 
our hospital work and to rediscover malta said de giorgio 
during the 268 years the knights were here they introduced new 
thinking in architecture law medicine and merchant shipping 
the knights made malta a thriving center of christianity and 
trade de giorgio said the knights also gave malta the legal codes 
that are the basis for much of its modern law in 1575 they built 
and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in 
europe they gave malta an architectural heritage of massive 
fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches 
the knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid 
centers in 90 countries especially in the third world and war 
zones 
the order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening 
of a hospice for pilgrims in jerusalem its centuriesold 
dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and 
wounded after the army of the first crusade captured jerusalem in 
1099 
it first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim 
routes to the holy land 
in the late 13th century after the holy land fell to the 
moslems the knights moved first to cyrpus and then to rhodes where 
they built a navy to fight the moslem ottoman empire 
sultan suleiman the magnificent defeated the knights and forced 
them to leave rhodes on jan 1 1523 although with huge losses to 
his troops 
seven years later the knights resumed the fight from malta 
once again suleiman attacked this time 600 knights 1230 mostly 
spanish soldiers and about 6000 maltese militia defeated an 
ottoman army of 40000 that victory in 1565 marked the beginning 
of the end for ottoman seapower and earned the knights the 
gratitude of a threatened europe

on march 24 1978 students and 
soldiers burst into tran tuan this factories ordered them closed 
and confiscated all the goods in the name of the socialist 
transformation of south vietnam 
now more than 10 years after he was left a pauper tran heads a 
private savings and loan association and runs a chicken farm a 
food processing plant and six foodstores 
tran is an ethnic chinese his own resurgence parallels the 
change in vietnams policies toward its chinese minority the most 
dynamic ethnic group in vietnam 
eleven years ago uniformed men broke down doors and dragged 
away shopkeepers throughout the chinese quarter arresting 
thousands as the communist government of the north sought to bring 
revolution to the recently conquered south 
the brutal policy left the chinese community in ruins and proved 
a major factor in the deterioration of relations between china and 
vietnam 
it also led to an exodus of tens of thousands of chinese 
vietnamese government officials got rich on the deal demanding 
bribes for safe passage to port towns in the south to this day 
many of the escapees still languish in refugee camps around asia 
now the government faced with growing poverty and falling 
production has turned to the chinese community for help in 
building vietnam 
chinese have been coming to vietnam since the 3rd century bc 
in the two milleniums since then china ruled vietnam for 900 
years in other times defeated chinese armies criminals starving 
peasants and persecuted monks all made their way to vietnam 
about 400000 ethnic chinese live in ho chi minh city mostly in 
the cholon suburb estimates of chinese nationwide vary from 
600000 to 1 million 
our recent treatment of the chinese has not always been 
completely perfect acknowledges nghi doan chairman of the 
peoples committee of ho chi minh citys 5th district which 
includes cholon but now we are even accepting that their 
businesses will undertake a certain level of exploitation as long 
as it benefits production 
these are radical words for a dedicated communist nghi himself 
an ethnic chinese has been a party member for 43 of his 61 years 
during the vietnam war he did underground work against the us and 
south vietnamese governments 
in some cases property confiscated from chinese has been 
returned starting early this year businessmen were allowed to 
open private banks an ad hoc stock market has formed among chinese 
traders government officials turn a blind eye to the black market 
and privately owned factories have been encouraged 
even big businessmen like ly sen an ethnic chinese who was 
named one of south vietnams three supercapitalists in a show 
trial in 1975 have been released from jail and encouraged to add 
their expertise to vietnams development 
the commies are our slaves now said one chinese merchant 
who learned his colloquial english from american gi customers 
during the war they need us more than we need them 
but the change has not completely satisfied the chinese 
chairman nghi estimates that production for district 5 has yet 
to reach half of what is was during the vietnam war years when 
little factories bars and restaurants served an international 
clientele of american soldiers and southeast asian businessmen 
chinese community leaders estimate that tens of thousands still 
want to leave vietnam and many chinese businessmen say they are 
worried the governments policies might turn radical again 
im not doing anything big right now said the chinese 
merchant i dont know when big boss is going to crack down most 
of us are just watching 
but others like tran tuan thi are going full steam ahead 
several years ago as reform policies began tran scraped 
together some capital from friends and started a food processing 
factory then he rented out storefronts to sell his goods 
impressed with his success the government contacted tran and 
offered him land to start a chicken farm tran jumped at the chance 
for a joint venture with the state 
ive got a lot of guts he said but i also figured the 
more i work with the government the less chance there is of them 
taking things away from me 
six months ago tran started a private bank the new city 
savings and loan association together with ly who was a top 
banker during the war he amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of investments 
loans are made at 8 percent to 10 percent a month and deposits 
pay 7 percent a month compounded quarterly or 125 percent a year 
ly says 
the rates which battle vietnams annual inflation of at least 
30 percent are higher than the governments monthly rate of 5 
percent for deposits and 8 percent for loans 
they trust us they trust me ly said explaining his 
success ive been a banker all my life so they have 
confidence another reason is that customers can withdraw their 
money freely state banks still demand a list of reasons and often 
substantial bribes to approve withdrawals 
lys son and daughter both escaped to the united states as boat 
people his wife also left several months before he was let out of 
jail in 1987 after 12 years 
despite the changes in vietnam he said he still hopes to leave 
im an old man and miss my family says the 64yearold i 
was once part of this countrys future but now im part of its 
past

denis goldberg no longer feels uneasy in a crowd 
but whenever he sits down to write his memoirs the recollections 
of 21 years in a south african prison still overwhelm him 
he served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant 
and now is in his fifth year in british exile but he says the 
ideals that got him nelson mandela and six other black 
nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the whiteled 
minority government made his life sentence bearable 
i didnt count every day i was in prison but i calculated 
it goldberg now 56 says in an interview i was there 7904 
days i dont regret one day it was worth it 
i certainly do not repudiate my past actions i do not 
repudiate the armed struggle i think its essential 
at 29 goldberg was an engineer turned bombmaker for the 
african national congress the banned black nationalist movement 
he was arrested at an anc hideout in johannesburg and given three 
life sentences in june 1964 for campaigning to overthrow the 
government by violent revolution 
deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in 
political violence he now runs the ancs mail order business in 
north london selling mostly tshirts and posters he lectures 
occasionally in britain and abroad 
on tuesday president fw de klerk said he will free five of 
goldbergs codefendants including anc political strategist walter 
sisulu but not mandela 
the other codefendant govan mbeki was freed in 1987 
goldberg calls their release a public relations exercise to 
show de klerk is amenable to change 
it took goldberg two years to adjust to freedom in london 
finally one morning suddenly i felt at ease the crowds didnt 
bother me 
theres a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is 
enriching he says it sounds corny but its very very true i 
find life incredibly exciting fulfilling and worthwhile 
his wife esme 60 says prison made him tender 
but the memories of prison run deep 
i find that when i do sit down to write about it i simply 
dont sleep he said a recollection of one incident brings 
back a whole chain of incidents and events and i find that this 
just overwhelms me 
the former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by 
revulsion for apartheid the raceseparation system under which 5 
million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks 
hes chubbier now and losing his hair and his quirky humor 
masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up 
his son david was 8 and his daughter hilary 5 when he left 
cape town in may 1963 intent on fleeing abroad a bomb had 
exploded in his garden obscenities were painted on his car and 
police were clamping down on dissidents he stayed on briefly to 
organize arms production for the anc 
had i not been arrested i would have gone on to start 
production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so

eight miners were killed and five 
injured when a hill of loose earth gave way at a gold mining pit in 
the northeastern amazon state of para officials said 
the disaster occurred around wednesday morning in the remote 
mountain range of serra pelada some 1900 miles northwest of rio 
when a 50foot wall of loose earth collapsed and swallowed the men 
alive said manoel candido leader of the serra peleda mining 
cooperative 
a wall of earth completely smothered them candido said by 
telephone 
candido said the victims were among a group of some 40 men 
working at the time of the mudslide in the mine known as the 
deep hole 
some 25000 miners work in the region he said 
the earth is very loose in the region those miners were 
warned not to mine in the area but there are not enough police to 
keep them away candido said he said a similar accident occurred 
near the mine site two weeks ago killing three miners 
rescue teams of civil and state police arrived at the site hours 
after the disaster and pulled a number of men from the earth he 
said 
weve saved some but there could be others still buried 
candido said he said the rescue workers would search for more 
victims through the night 
such accidents have grown more common since an estimated 1 
million prospectors invaded brazils vast amazon jungle after rich 
deposits of alluvial gold were discovered there in 1979 
since then thousands of people mostly unskilled peasants have 
been lured to mine sites where they dig with their hands and carry 
bags of mud on their backs and up precarious rope ladders

britains first public auction of 
llamas did little for the longeyelashed beast of burdens new 
status as a fashionable pet 
of the 24 llamas and three alpacas on auction wednesday at the 
national agriculture center onethird were sold but the remainder 
were withdrawn because bidders did not offer the minimum reserve 
price said jonathan wheeler a spokesman for the center 
the south american livestock have been gaining in popularity 
both as pets and for their highly prized fleece 
the highest price paid was 8000 for a 4yearold female llama 
but a final bid of 11200 for two alpacas came in below the 
reserve price several male llamas were sold for less than 300 
wheeler said 
pamela walker secretary of british camelids ltd an owners and 
breeders group estimated there are 700 and 1000 privately owned 
llamas and alpacas in britain 
they are lovable intelligent creatures and you can get very 
attached to them she said they are resilient to the cold 
winters do not need particularly lush pastures for grazing and 
small children can ride them without fear of any aggression

the pilot zoomed low between 
the pink craggy peaks of the sheep mountains suddenly twisting 
his f16 falcon vertically into the desert sky before diving on the 
target a railroad bridge 
capt kevin omar bradleys plane plunged toward the bridge 
as he pushed his pickle button simulating bombs away bradley 
pointed the falcons nose up climbed radically and turned 
eliciting groans from his reporter passenger as the gs 
increased to seven times the force of gravity 
the lean 30yearold pilot from binghamton ny didnt seem 
bothered we have to do a lot of things to keep in condition 
he said 
bradley pushed the fighter past mach 1 through the sound 
barrier and with a sonic boom for salute headed back toward the 
tactical fighter weapons center at nellis air force base known in 
the tactical air command as the home of the fighter pilot 
despite improved superpower relations with hopes high for 
general world peace professional warriors are still working to 
keep a combat edge gunsmoke a biennial competition decides 
the best of the best in air force precision gunnery and bombing 
peace is breaking out all over so why maintain the edge 
asked maj gen billy mccoy a 6foot4 texan who flew 223 missions 
in vietnam and commands the fighter training center at nellis 
every kid competing in gunsmoke will tell you today that we 
have always dickered best from a position of strength we ought 
to have a pair of russian generals out here id host em for the 
whole two weeks said mccoy 
as bradley soared away from the target area in his fighter a 
formation of a10 thunderbolt pilots from the connecticut air 
national guard swept by completing bombing and strafing runs that 
were part of the twoweek shooting competition which ends saturday 
the connecticut fliers are joined by guard units from terre 
haute ind sioux city iowa and kirtland air force base nm 
and by reserve units from luke air force base ariz grissom air 
force base ind and bergstrom air force base texas 
they are competing against regular air force units from as far 
away as japan alaska the philippines and west germany 
the fliers at nellis already have won competitions in their home 
units and are vying to be top guns an air forcewide honor 
held for two years 
maj patrick hoy of falls city neb who was top gun in his 
a10 thunderbolt two years ago said i dont think any rational 
individual would wish to be at war but it can be difficult being a 
warrior when peace is breaking out 
the biggest problem the us has to deal with when we are not 
in conflict is complacency if you have a garden and you leave 
it for a few days the weeds begin to grow 
during competition capt angus simpson an a10 pilot from 
eielson air force base alaska put all 200 rounds in the white 
target panel sitting on the arid wasteland that is fighter pilot 
heaven north of las vegas it was the first such perfect score 
said capt tom christie an air force spokesman 
for bradley becoming a fighter pilot was a childhood dream 
nurtured by an uncle who took him to air shows he started flying 
singleengine propeller planes when he was 17 now piloting the 
supersophisticated f16 over the sheep mountains he is at the top 
end of the air force dream sheet 
for me there is nothing else bradley said everything 
else is a zero my family has a business i had no aptitude 
whatsoever for it the only thing for me was flying 
the flier nicknamed omar for the world war ii general 
faces the possibility he will never fire a shot in anger 
the slogan for tactical aviation is readiness is our 
profession he said the military needs to detach itself from 
the emotions about hopes for relaxed tension between the 
superpowers 
without the ordeal of combat to provide the ultimate warriors 
test the fliers use competitions such as gunsmoke the biggest 
of its kind to maintain their adrenaline levels 
next to my marriage and the birth of my children it was the 
most exciting moment of my life to be able to sit back in a moment 
of quiet reflection and realize that on that day i was the best

it is not only the tens of thousands of ordinary 
workers students housewives and shopkeepers who are complaining 
about conditions in east germany and berating its leaders 
even privileged communist party members some of them world 
renowned figures in the sports musical and theater worlds have 
joined the chorus 
many of them risk jeopardizing the special status they enjoy if 
their criticisms get too loud 
still authors entertainers artists and sports personalities 
have urged the hardline leadership to reexamine its policies and 
open a dialogue with opposition groups 
the calls have ranged from a joint appeal by as many as 300 east 
berlin artists to individual statements by such prominent authors 
as christa wolf 
katarina witt the twotime olympic figure skating gold medalist 
and possibly the bestknown east german abroad said the communist 
government must think about the causes for the exodus of its people 
to the west 
about 50000 east germans have fled west in recent months 
either crossing hungarys recently opened border to austria or 
after seeking refuge in bonns embassies in prague czechoslovakia 
and warsaw poland 
the exodus deeply embarrassed the government last weekend during 
40th anniversary festivities that were overshadowed by nationwide 
demonstrations unseen since soviet tanks crushed a workers 
uprising in 1953 
it makes me sad it hurts me that so many people have left the 
country ms witt told reporters in munich west germany where 
she was touring this week with a show 
something will change in east germany said ms witt 
herself a member of the communist party and a beneficiary of the 
perks bestowed on major athletic stars 
ms witt has been a glamorous ambassador of goodwill and 
previously limited her political statments to praise for the 
benefits of a socialist system 
the brutal force used by security police against demonstrators 
over the weekend caused some public figures to call for restraint 
christa wolf a wellknown author who is widely read in west 
germany urged both sides to show prudence calm and patience 
in a statement broadcast by west german radio stations she 
criticized communist authorities for outlawing the new forum 
opposition group calling the move a fatal mistake 
the author whose daughter and soninlaw were arrested during 
weekend demonstrations in east berlin called for a broad dialogue 
over the future of the country 
kurt masur chief director of the famed leipzig gewandhause 
orchestra and cabaret star berndt lutz lange joined three local 
communist party officials in calling for a dialogue between the 
opposition and authorities 
after their statement was read on leipzig radio about 70000 
people demonstrated in the city monday evening unlike the weekend 
clashes the biggest demonstration in the current wave of protests 
ended peacefully with no intervention from massive security forces 
actors in two east berlin theaters have posted statements 
calling for dialogue between the state and the opposition 
a similar statement was read by the cast in the dresden city 
theater after a recent performance after authorities warned the 
actors not to read the statement again they stood silently on the 
stage after the next performance and distributed it to the public 
a group of 300 east berlin painters sculptors and other artists 
have passed a resolution calling for a broad public discussion of 
the countrys problems they also urged the statecontrolled media 
to open up to all forces seeking democratic reforms 
a statement by 44 entertainers including wellknown east german 
rock bands such as pankow and city criticized the unbearable 
ignorance of the communist leadership 
the statement published in a west berlin newspaper called for 
reforms that will not remove socialism but continue to make it 
possible in east germany 
hermann kant president of the official writers union and a 
member of the communist party central committee wrote an open 
letter to the junge welt newspaper criticizing censorship in the 
media 
the letter published on monday by the official youth newspaper 
said it would be wrong to abscribe our current defeat to the 
evil class enemy 
east germanys staterun newspapers have bitterly denounced 
western particularly west german media blaming them for 
triggering the exodus and instigating the protests

the career diplomats union is using newly 
released state department documents in a bid to bolster its claim 
that some political nominees for ambassadorships are unqualified 
for their jobs 
less than a month after the american foreign service association 
filed suit to obtain the documents the state department last week 
handed over to the union 51 certificates of competence of 
ambassadorial nominees 
in filing the suit afsa had said the state department was 
abusing the confidential classification to avoid embarrassment 
because the certificates could not conceal the lack of 
qualifications of some nominees 
the career diplomats have complained for years about what they 
regard as presidents tendency to nominate as ambassadors 
diplomatic novices at the expense of foreign service professionals 
the state department had repeatedly refused to comment on the 
substance of the associations complaint although department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler noted last month that president nixon 
went outside the diplomatic service when he chose george bush as 
united nations ambassador in 1970 
a 1980 law says ambassadorial nominees should be knowledgeable 
about all aspects of the country of their assignment and that 
political campaign contributions should not be a factor in the 
selection process 
one example cited by afsa was joseph zappala a florida 
developer who was nominated to be ambassador to spain after 
reportedly donating 126000 to the republican party last year 
afsa maintained that zappalas qualifications as shown in the 
certificate were not consistent with requirements for background 
knowledge of the host country 
the certificate states that zappalas impressive business 
background in real estate combined with his civic activities 
qualify him as an excellent candidate for us ambassador to 
spain zappala won senate confirmation by a 7920 vote 
while some political appointees including the former ambassador 
to japan mike mansfield have excelled others have been an 
embarrassment career diplomats say one frequently cited example 
is a former ambassador to a caribbean country who often spent 
evening hours on his luxury boat using the sail as a screen for 
showing his collection of pornographic movies 
a bush nominee who drew criticism from afsa is sally j 
novetske legislative representative of the national council on 
vocational education selected to be ambassador to malta 
her certificate called her an excellent candidate but afsa 
vice president charles schmitz described her resume as unusually 
thin 
last saturday the senate confirmed by voice vote two other 
politically wellconnected nominees whose appointments had drawn 
criticism from sen paul sarbanes dmd 
they are della newman a real estate broker headed for new 
zealand who managed president bushs washington state campaign last 
year and melvin sembler a florida real estate tycoon who is bound 
for australia after contributing 127000 to bushs 1988 campaign 
their respective certificates released by the state department 
described them both as excellent candidates but made little 
further effort to back up the recommendations 
schmitz said the certificates are not prepared by the state 
department but by two bush political appointees who work out of an 
office that deals with personnel matters

more than 100 chicago air traffic controllers 
fired during the 1981 strike are seeking reinstatement after a 
house panel said us aviation officials altered time sheets and 
lied to an employee appeals board 
citing the new evidence attorneys for the controllers asked the 
merit systems protection board to reopen the cases 
right or wrong they the controllers were entitled to their 
day in court attorney phillip s wood said tuesday if it 
turns out the entire evidentiary product was phony and they 
destroyed the original evidence what else is there 
faa spokesman fred farrar said he had no comment on the petition 
filed by wood and attorney gary klein 
the board upheld the firings in 1985 based on federal aviation 
administration attendance records which showed that the chicago 
controllers failed to report to work during the strike 
but a house panel last month said faa officials doctored 
evidence and lied to the board when they said the time sheets used 
to defend the firings were the same ones kept during the strike 
instead the subcommittees report said faa officials set up a 
war room at the chicago air route traffic control center in 
aurora ill and for three months created records to replace 
original shoddy documents 
wood said the controllers want their jobs back he said he was 
not disputing whether the controllers failed to report to work 
during the strike by the professional air traffic controllers 
organization 
rather like the subcommittee wood said he was concerned about 
the faa records placed before the appeals board 
the board has to look beyond the litigants here he said 
it has to look at the integrity of the system how can anyone win 
when the faa pulled what it pulled here 
the petition to reopen the cases was filed last week 
the house public works and transportation subcommittee has asked 
the justice department to investigate current and former faa 
officials for possible criminal misconduct 
during the strike president reagan fired 11500 controllers 
including about 450 in chicago

private researchers charge the white house 
with wholesale violations of federal recordkeeping laws and say 
their suit to block destruction of reagan administration computer 
tapes would not hamstring president bush in performing his duties 
lawyers for several research groups filed their response tuesday 
to a justice department move in a case that could decide whether 
the white house can routinely destroy the kind of computer messages 
that were discovered in the irancontra affair 
after a chance for government lawyers to answer the new 
arguments us district judge charles richey will decide whether 
to proceed with the case or allow it to go directly to the court of 
appeals as the government wants 
richey ruled on sept 15 that the private organizations may sue 
the president to block erasure of the tapes 
lawyers for the national security archive and other 
organizations claim the bush administration is trying to avoid 
responding to inquiries that will reveal wholesale violations of 
the presidential records act and the other federal records laws 
through the routine destruction of information 
the case involves 12 days of tapes generated on the professional 
office system known as profs used in the executive office of the 
president 
on jan 18 two days before he left office president ronald 
reagan instructed staff members to erase their computer message 
systems the next day the organizations filed suit to require the 
white house to preserve backup tapes that stored these messages in 
a computer bank 
the tapes have since been preserved under a temporary 
restraining order issued in january by us district judge 
barrington parker 
the justice department asked on sept 27 that the case be 
shunted directly to the us court of appeals partly because it 
involved a threat to the presidents authority 
the organizations that filed suit denied such dire 
consequences are involved they argued that richeys sept 15 
order does not interfere with the presidents ability to do his 
duties 
instead they said the justice department is apparently trying 
to assure the president of authority to make unilateral and 
unreviewable decisions to destroy the profs information 
regardless of whether it falls within the definition of 
presidential records that congress has mandated must be preserved 
for the benefit of future generations 
the national security archive a washington nonprofit group that 
researches national security issues filed the suit along with the 
american library association the american historical association 
and the center for national security studies of the american civil 
liberties union 
the profs messages played an important role in the congressional 
investigation of the irancontra affair during reagans 
admninistration 
oliver l north the white house aide at the center of the 
affair frequently sent profs messages to his superiors in 
november 1986 he tried to erase them but he did not know they 
were automatically being stored on magnetic tape in the central 
computer bank by using these tapes the congressional committees 
investigating the affair were able to reconstruct much of the 
information

guns knives and tomahawks were the 
tools of war 215 years ago when the battle of point pleasant raged 
on a narrow strip of land where the kanawha and ohio rivers meet 
now words and history books serve as the weapons 
point pleasant claims that it not lexington mass was the 
site of the first battle of the american revolution 
historians and geographers acknowledge that the battle known 
as lord dunmores war is important but for other reasons 
they came out this way to solve an indian problem the 
uprising of the shawnee said alan gould a former history 
professor and now marshall universitys provost it can be 
extremely difficult to say its the first battle of the 
revolution 
but thats what point pleasant residents celebrated tuesday the 
anniversary of the battle 
before the battle the virginia armies marched to invade the 
indian country four days later a 1000man division under gen 
andrew lewis was attacked by about 1000 indians led by chief 
cornstalk finally after a nearly daylong battle the indians 
retreated leaving 33 dead the virginians had 60 killed and 96 
wounded 
the victory resulted in a treaty on terms dictated by dunmore 
the colonial governor 
congress has declared this a battle of the revolution and in a 
chronological list of the battles this is the first said 
bradley reed superintendent of the point pleasant battle monument 
state park 
according to records at the national society of the sons of the 
american revolution in louisville ky congress on feb 17 1908 
passed a resolution recognizing the battle of point pleasant as a 
fight in the american revolution and appropriated money for a 
monument dedicated oct 10 1909 the battles 135th anniversary 
consequently both the sons and daughters of the american 
revolution accept descendants from the battle as members 
its annoying that this should have to be covered up said 
donald j pennell of birmingham mich a past historian general 
for the sar were fighting new englands hold on history that 
group has been mighty tight with history 
pennell said he grew up believing that the revolution began in 
lexington on april 19 1775 six months after point pleasant he 
changed his mind after meeting a west virginian who mentioned the 
battle its significance and the congressional resolution 
we need a nationally recognized historian to look at this and 
say yea or nay and you have to get someone away from the 
boston area pennell said nobody has ever refuted publicly the 
statement in this congressional record that this is the first 
battle of the revolution 
gould agrees the battle should be recognized by congress but 
not as a revolutionary fight 
we can say that the events that precipitated the battle of 
point pleasant had little to do with colonial grievances against 
the crown gould said the impact was that it kept the shawnees 
quiet for a while when the first shots were fired in lexington and 
concord 
i dont think anyone fighting in the battle saw it as a 
rebellion against the crown 
in 1903 the ohio archaeological and historical quarterly called 
point pleasant the first revolutionary fight because dunmore put 
the indians up to it to create two battlefronts for the colonists 
gould said dunmore was a loyalist but doubted whether he staged 
the fight 
although point pleasant claims the first battle of the 
revolution the historian at the minute men national historical 
park in concord mass says he never heard of the conflict 
i think theyre reaching historian doug sabin said 
people often do that with historical firsts 
congress resolution 81 years ago should have recognized point 
pleasants significance in the united states western expansion 
said sam clagg marshalls professor emeritus in geography and the 
author of west virginias section in the encyclopaedia britannica 
it was significant in breaking the indian stronghold in the 
west clagg said it established that we were willing to make a 
stand on this side of the mountains 
treaties that ended hostilities in the late 1700s gave the new 
country rights to lands as far west as the mississippi largely 
because of the victory at point pleasant gould said 
without the victory he said the united states would have been 
granted lands only as west as the alleghenies leaving everything 
beyond to france and spain 
i think they might be celebrating the wrong thing gould 
said they ought to be celebrating the significance of that 
victory in american history and thats that it secured the 
frontier

mci communications corp is asking a federal 
court to force american telephone amp telegraphs deceptive ads 
off the air even though mci claims it is taking 100000 customers 
a week away from its rival 
mci chairman william mcgowan said tuesday that mci filed suit 
because atampt is using false and deceptive ads comparing the two 
longdistance phone services in a desperate attempt to stem the 
loss of customers 
they are panicking about it mcgowan said 
atampts market share has fallen to 75 percent since mci broke the 
old bell systems monopoly on us phone service in the 1970s 
mcis share now is more than 10 percent 
mcgowan said mci research showed atampt is losing even more than 
100000 customers a week but mcis marketing department which has 
been trumpeting that number in its own ads likes round numbers 
but he said mci is suffering substantial financial losses even 
as it takes away atampt customers 
the mci lawsuit in us district court the latest in a long 
string of dustups between the nations two leading longdistance 
companies charges atampt made false comparisons between its service 
and mcis primetime cutrate longdistance calling plan 
mci complains about atampt ads that say mcis rates are cheaper 
only when brief calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 pm 
and that mci customers might have had better luck calling mars 
than trying to reach mci for an explanation of their bills 
atampt maliciously attacked mcis honesty and the value of mcis 
competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that 
atampt was superior to its competitors in general and mci in 
particular in terms of trustworthiness quality and price the 
suit said 
mci itself is known for aggressive advertising such as showing 
people fainting when they see their nonmci longdistance phone 
bills but mcgowan said mci now is being outspent 8to1 by atampt in 
advertising 
he said he could not estimate the losses mci had suffered as a 
result of atampt ads but he said its substantial 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said we welcome the opportunity to 
discuss who is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit 
we have been concerned about mcis sometimes misleading print and 
broadcast advertising and have complained about it directly to 
mci 
he said atampt attorneys sent a letter to abc cbs nbc and cnn 
this month complaining that mci was stretching facts in ads that 
claim mci always saves you money over atampt month after month 
and that every week 100000 atampt customers switch to mci 
atampt said the ads are false and asked the networks to stop 
running them 
linnen said abc and cbs had replied that they would look into 
the matter but nbc and cnn had not yet responded to the letter 
atampt stands behind its advertising linnen added 
mci complains in its suit about atampt statements that nonatampt 
companies provide slow telephone connections that other companies 
dont operate worldwide like atampt and that competing 800 facsimile 
and wats services are inferior 
the suit asks the court to stop atampt from making false or 
deceptive representations that any atampt service is materially 
superior to any competing mci service in terms of quality or lower 
cost or that mci has misrepresented its services or rates to 
consumers 
it also asks a judge to force atampt to stop advertising for 12 
months unless such information clearly and conspicuously 
discloses a courtapproved corrective notice that mitigates the 
lingering effects of the misrepresentations described therein 
mci also wants the profits wrongfully amassed by atampt on the 
sale of its products or services during the period in question 
plus interest and legal fees the suit does not put a price on 
those profits

white house chief of staff john sununu is the 
chief disciplinarian of the bush white house the one to whom top 
officials get sent when they misbehave 
president bush with the image of being kinder and gentler by 
far than his staff chief rarely chews out members of his team 
directly according to white house insiders 
instead thats the job of sununu the former threeterm new 
hampshire governor with a reputation for managing with a firm hand 
sometimes when more than just a mild chastising is needed the 
punishment is doled out in two parts sununu talks to the errant 
official privately and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater lets 
the world know about it 
the most recent official to be so admonished by sununu was 
former education secretary bill bennett 
bennett currently the national drug policy director had 
suggested at last months education summit in charlottesville va 
that some sessions among governors had been full of pap and 
stuff that rhymes with pap 
fitzwater duly relayed sununus words of wisdom to the 
independentminded bennett thanks for your comments they 
werent helpful 
i think bennetts probably gotten the message fitzwater 
said thereby making sure that bennett did get the message 
it was the same as the onetwo reprimand dished out in march to 
white house counsel c boyden gray he had publicly raised 
questions about the wisdom of a central america compromise reached 
with congress and negotiated by secretary of state james a baker 
iii 
fitzwater said gray had met with sununu and they had a polite 
discussion about how things work in the white house 
white house sources who insisted upon anonymity said other top 
administration officials who have received similar courses in how 
things work in the white house include 
veterans affairs secretary edward j derwinski for announcing 
the government would not appeal a federal judges decision on agent 
orange without first clearing it with budget director richard 
darman 
the ruling striking down restrictions on benefits likely will 
result in more us compensation for vietnamera veterans exposed 
to the defoliant 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner who was admonished 
not to fly alone in making decisions on a dutch airlines 
participation in the buyout of northwest airlines 
interior secretary manuel lujan and skinner again who were 
brought in and told to stop bickering over turf battles in alaskan 
oil spill cleanup efforts 
and defense secretary dick cheney soon after he was sworn in 
rapidly learned that freelancing wasnt a trait that won points 
with sununu 
although its not known what sununu might have told cheney 
privately the chief of staff was quick to publicly repudiate 
cheneys forecast of eventual failure for kremlin chief mikhail s 
gorbachev 
in becoming white house disciplinarian sununu is just 
assuming a role that has been one of the traditional functions of 
the chief of staff said a senior white house official who works 
with sununu and didnt wish to be identified for that reason 
hes the one to keep people in line and hes very good at it 
hes not one youd want to cross the official said 
andrew h card jr a sununu deputy and loyalist said most 
people outside washington dont understand that the white house 
takes on the personality of the chief of staff more than it takes 
on the personality of the president 
sununus management style became an issue during the postmortem 
pronouncements on what went wrong during last weeks failed coup 
attempt in panama critics have claimed a lack of coordination 
between the white house and other national security agencies 
contributed to the chaos 
reports of a rift between sununu and national security adviser 
brent scowcroft resurfaced friction that white house sources say 
intensifies whenever sununu wanders into scowcrofts realm 
former president reagan too sometimes used his chiefs of staff 
to administer rebukes to top officials 
for instance it was james baker chief of staff in reagans 
first term and not the president who actually took thenbudget 
director david stockman to the woodshed according to 
stockmans account in his 1986 book triumph of politics 
stockman in trouble for telling a magazine interviewer he had 
grave misgivings about reagans economic policies wrote that he 
wasnt scolded by reagan in the oval office meeting but urged by 
a moisteyed reagan to stay on

nbc news anchor deborah norville says her taping 
of nonbroadcast interviews of business executives during a 
paid appearance in february didnt violate the networks news 
guidelines 
my understanding was that i would be interviewing some 
marketing people which i did do norville said tuesday of the 
appearance at a philip morris corporate sales presentation in 
hawaii 
norville whose moonlighting at the conference first was 
reported in this weeks newsweek magazine said the interviews 
werent done for nbc and simply were part of the conference 
but the format was more involved than that as i discovered 
when i got there she said she said she hadnt expected the 
format prepared for her might put her in a position of seeming to 
endorse some products 
when she realized there was a problem she said in a phone 
interview she tried to make the best of an awkward situation 
i rewrote everything they had prepared for me to say she 
said i just said look i cant say these things and i made a 
point of rewriting everything so that nothing i said could be 
construed as an endorsement 
in retrospect the network would not have let her appear at the 
sales conference said nbc news president michael gartner 
none of us understood the format of her engagement until it 
was too late he said 
had we understood what was involved or expected of deborah we 
would not have done it and clearly its something we wouldnt do 
again he said in a prepared response to a query about the paid 
appearance she cited 
norville who since sept 5 has been news anchor of the 
today show was anchor of nbc news at sunrise when she got 
the invitation to appear at the sales meeting she was given 
permission to accept by gerry solomon then executive producer of 
sunrise 
nbc news guidelines say that staff members considering 
invitations to speak lecture or make personal appearances should 
use their judgment to avoid being placed in a situation in which 
they may be used for any purpose 
norville who declined to say how much she was paid said she 
certainly didnt accept the engagement with any thought that i 
would be violating any guidelines and i dont believe that i did 
however she conceded it was a difficult situation and i was 
there and i had to be as graceful about it as i could yet try to 
be mindful of what my responsibility as a journalist is it was a 
difficult rope to walk and i tried to walk it as best as i could

four men believed to be illegal aliens 
were found dead tuesday in a railroad trailer marked with skulls 
and a danger warning and authorities tried to determine if a 
pesticide used on the flour inside contributed to their deaths 
the border patrol was investigating to determine if smugglers 
put the men in the trailer said border patrol agent brian french 
the four apparently were asphyxiated said victoria police lt 
jack williams autopsies were to be performed by the travis county 
medical examiners office in austin police said 
authorities also were investigating the death of a fifth found 
alongside railroad tracks in sinton where the train stopped 
earlier en route to victoria investigators believe the death is 
related to the other four 
san patricio county sheriff leroy moody said its possible the 
man died in the same railroad car and fell out 
they put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar 
apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the 
hole williams said adding the hole probably was made for 
ventilation 
anne cuddeback an investigator with the texas department of 
healths hazard communication branch in austin said the fumigant 
used in the trailer loaded with flour could be fatal if inhaled 
or injested 
the trailer was piggybacked on a railroad flatcar a sticker on 
the trailer door showed skulls and said in english and spanish 
danger this trailer is being fumigated 
its quite possible there was enough of the fumigant around to 
kill the guys ms cuddeback said the fumigant can cause nausea 
and vomiting she said 
ms cuddeback said the fumigant is really very very nasty 
the effects to men in the trailer could be pretty awful if it 
was inhaled 
three emergency medical service workers and seven victoria 
police officers later were taken from the scene to a victoria 
hospital some of the officers complained of nausea and vomiting 
but the others were just under observation said police lt richard 
jones 
the victims bodies were found by a southern pacific car 
inspector after a railroad worker noticed the door was open on the 
40foot trailer normally part of a tractortrailer rig or 
18wheeler 
the victims appeared to be in their 20s said victoria police 
lt richard jones three of the four had papers although police 
hadnt verified the documents tuesday one had a mexican passport 
one had documents from honduras and a third had papers that had 
been stamped in el salvador but indicated he was from venezuela 
jones said he said the fourth man did not carry any identification 
french said the border patrol is working through the mexican 
consul to identify the men 
police said the train left harlingen on monday evening 
overnighted in sinton and continued on early tuesday to victoria 
a town of about 50000 people 125 miles southwest of houston and 
200 miles northeast of harlingen the morning was cool with 
temperatures at victoria in the mid50s 
the trailer was half filled with boxes of corn flour called 
masa used for tortillas 
the masa had been fumigated with phostoxin an aluminum 
phosphate pesticide used against rodents and insects before the 
trailer was sealed and loaded on the train in harlingen said jorge 
trevino quality control manager for the flour producer azteca 
milling co in edinburg 
he did not know exactly when a contractor had treated and sealed 
the trailer but azteca traffic manager gonzalo garcia said the men 
must have broken into the trailer after it was put on the train 
victoria police sgt john burney said symptoms caused by the 
pesticide are diarrhea and vomiting which they found inside the 
car 
tuesdays discovery was the latest in a series of incidents 
since 1980 in which illegal aliens died after crossing into the 
united states 
on july 2 1987 18 mexican men suffocated after a smuggler 
locked them inside a railroad boxcar that was later parked for 
hours in the desert sun east of el paso the men had crossed the 
border and entered the missouripacific freight yard at el paso 
one man survived by punching a breathing hole in the boxcar 
floor with a spike 
since then border agents have saved dozens of illegal aliens 
trapped in similar situations

gulf coast shrimpers are looking to president 
bush for a lastminute reprieve from regulations they claim will 
cost them nearly a third of their income 
unless bush intervenes shrimp fishermen will face stiff fines 
next week if they are caught without devices in their nets that 
prevent the drowning of endangered sea turtles 
the texas shrimp association predicts quiet compliance with the 
law but executive director ralph rayburn also says shrimpers could 
lose up to 30 percent of their catch at a time when earnings are 
banked to get them through the nonproductive winter months 
congressmen from the gulf coast say shrimping is an endangered 
industry that cannot afford to use the turtle excluder devices or 
teds 
youre beginning to see less shrimpers than less turtles 
says rep solomon ortiz dtexas who has watched the number of 
shrimpindustry employees in port isabel texas fall from nearly 
3000 to fewer than 400 in six years 
ortiz and rep billy tauzin dla say fuel and insurance costs 
for the shrimpers have been mounting as prices have been driven 
down by shrimp imports which now account for 75 percent of us 
consumption 
although shrimpers have been required to use teds since sept 8 
the federal government has forgiven the penalties at first in 
whole and later in part if a shrimper bought and installed a ted 
sunday however is the last day for such reprieves on monday a 
shrimper found in violation of the law faces an 8000 fine a 
second offense could result in a 15000 fine and a third offense 
could cost 15000 and the confiscation of the shrimpers vessel 
catch or both 
thats unless bush who agreed to review the matter intervenes 
in the longfought battle between environmentalists and shrimpers 
over the use of teds 
the issue is now before john sununu the white house chief of 
staff said tauzin 
tauzin says hes expecting penalties and angry shrimpers if the 
law isnt modified but hopes there wont be a repeat of earlier 
blockades of gulf coast shipping channels by protesting shrimp 
fishermen 
tauzin believes shrimpers could lose up to 50 percent of their 
catch as crews inexperienced with the devices search for 
everscarcer shrimp a 10 percent loss in catch is enough to put 
some shrimpers out of business he said 
government scientists have found losses from teds can range from 
5 percent to 10 percent or even less but those demonstrations 
were conducted with crews experienced in using teds rayburn says 
conservationists argue shrimping is the single greatest cause of 
turtle mortality and that teds are the best prevention

about 2000 riot police swinging batons 
and firing water cannon broke up a demonstration outside a jail 
early today and at least 64 people were injured protest leaders 
and police reported 
police said 15 people were arrested but provided no further 
details of what appeared to be one of the most violent incidents 
since demonstrations were made legal after martial law was lifted 
in 1987 
riot police launched water cannons at us first they then 
wielded clubs at the unarmed crowd said protest leader yang 
chuchun i saw at least 20 people with head injuries in a nearby 
hospital and we estimated at least 50 people were wounded 
seriously 
in a statement taipei county police said 14 police were hurt in 
the melee 
the demonstration began tuesday on taiwans national day when 
10000 people rallied outside the tucheng jail in a taipei suburb 
to demand the immediate release of prominent dissident hsu 
hsinliang 
the protesters wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow 
flowers shouted release hsu hsinliang and vowed to sleep 
outside the jail because they were denied permission to meet with 
hsu 
about 3000 protesters remained past midnight the fighting 
began at 3 am today when riot police moved to disperse the crowd 
which broke up after a twohour clash 
police claimed the demonstration was illegal because protest 
leaders did not apply for permission and said breaking up the 
sitin was designed to avoid violence the statement said hsus 
wife was among the arrested 
hsu 48 was jailed after he returning from the united states 
last month making the final portion of his journey in a fishing 
boat from china the government accuses him of helping organize a 
1979 antigovernment demonstration in the southern port of 
kaohsiung 
protest leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at 
demanding more political freedom and that a retrial was necessary

a combination of hightech devices 
armed patrols alligators and rattlesnakes should keep antinuclear 
demonstrators from reaching the space shuttle atlantis launch pad 
security officials say 
i wouldnt want to get into the number of officers but you 
can be assured that we feel we have adequate people to take 
care of any situation said gary wistrand deputy director of 
kennedy space centers security office 
wistrands comments tuesday came in response to statements by 
antinuclear activists that they would try to infiltrate the launch 
pad if a federal judge failed to block the liftoff 
in washington tuesday evening us district judge oliver gasch 
ruled that the launch could go ahead because the national 
aeronautics and space administration had complied with the 
requirements of the national environmental protection act 
attorneys for the florida coalition for peace and justice tried 
to block the launch of the shuttle and the plutoniumladen galileo 
jupiter probe on safety grounds 
were sad because the court didnt rule in our favor but on 
the other side we feel like weve succeeded in bringing the issue 
to the public that they are plannning to put nuclear power in 
space bruce gagnon the groups coordinator in florida said 
after the ruling 
gagnon said protesters plan to follow through with their 
intention to block the launch by putting people on the launch pad 
wistrand said his force armed with m16 assault rifles and 9mm 
semiautomatic pistols is prepared to find and arrest anyone who 
attempts to get onto the 140000acre space center 
were concerned by all aspects whether its by land by plane 
or by boat but i think the most likely way is by foot wistrand 
said 
the swampy areas around the launch pad limit the lanes of 
approach wistrand said 
in demonstrations two years ago about 20 people were arrested 
on space center property he said 
what we found is that because of the swamps which include 
alligators rattlesnakes and wild hogs they demonstrators mainly 
want to stay on the high and dry land he said it made it

congressional limits on covert action thwarted 
the bush administration in its handling of the panama crisis says 
defense secretary dick cheney who faults lawmakers for interfering 
in the white house effort 
the former wyoming congressman spent much of last week on 
capitol hill defending the administration against charges it 
mishandled the abortive coup against panamanian dictator gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
in an interview tuesday with the associated press cheney took 
the offensive complaining lawmakers involvement in an area 
really not their bailiwick undercut the executive branchs 
ability to deal with the crisis 
we had situations here where members of congress were 
literally calling agencies downtown or even people in panama as 
these events unfolded demanding information that creates all 
kinds of problems cheney said 
he declined however to name any names among his former 
colleagues 
the defense secretary who served in the house for more than 10 
years said that although members of congress have legitimate 
oversight roles they ought to refrain from trying to intrude in 
the process while it is still unfolding 
adding to the problems of congressional interference were the 
comments made by lawmakers based on information that was usually 
a small piece of the total picture and in some cases 
inaccurate cheney said 
they certainly complicate our lives when they run out and make 
public pronouncements in front of the press knowing only half of 
what there is to know the defense secretary said 
as an example cheney cited the assertion that noriega was 
offered to us officials 
sen jesse helms rnc repeatedly has contended that was the 
case although cheney and other administration officials say 
theyve found no evidence that such an offer was ever made 
questioned about clashes this past weekend between the 
administration and members of the senate over restrictions on 
covert action cheney said officials have been handcuffed in their 
ability to act 
theres no question in my mind that weve reached a point 
where it is a complicated business to try to function in this 
area he said theres complications that have developed over 
the years because of various and sundry rules and restraints 
choosing his words carefully after expressing concerns about 
divulging classified information cheney described a hypothetical 
situation in which the united states learning about a planned 
coup assesses those involved and their strategy as well as 
positions its forces 
you cant really do that without congressional approval these 
days its very difficult to get that cheney said 
on the defense budget cheney said he would recommend a 
presidential veto if house and senate negotiators produce 
legislation that gives inadequate financing to strategic programs 
such as the b2 stealth bomber and adds money for weapons cheney 
has proposed canceling 
asked about calls from congressional republicans that the 
administration take a stand on an acceptable budget total for the 
strategic defense initiative cheney said the pentagon was seeking 
the 45 billion approved in the senate version of the defense 
authorization bill 
he conceded however the total may not be possible given the 
current negotiations with the house which approved 31 billion of 
the 49 billion bush requested its not a matter of our 
dictating a particular number and saying this is has absolutely got 
to be 
responding to warnings from capitol hill that a fleet of 132 b2 
bombers at an eventual cost of 70 billion is impossible cheney 
fired back that if congress had accepted the budget he proposed in 
may there would be no problem in funding the program 
we showed them how to do it he said referring to his 
proposed funding for the strategic programs and cancellation of the 
marine corps v22 osprey the tiltrotor aircraft and the navys 
f14d tomcat jet fighter congress is looking to restore the two 
conventional programs

congressional leaders believe their dispute 
over the capital gains tax cut pushed by president bush is 
virtually certain to trigger the grammrudman laws automatic 
spending cuts next week 
their assessment came tuesday after house and senate leaders of 
both parties failed again to unravel their differences over the 
proposed capital gains tax reduction 
the argument has delayed senate debate on a related 14 billion 
deficitcutting bill unless that legislation is passed by monday 
automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs expected to 
total about 16 billion will take effect 
youre not going to avoid the cutbacks senate minority 
leader bob dole rkan said after a nearly twohour private 
session i think were all pretty much in agreement on that 
dole met in the capitol with senate democratic leader george 
mitchell of maine house speaker thomas s foley dwash and 
house minority leader robert michel rill 
mitchell said he believed the chances of avoiding the 
grammrudman reductions are extremely remote 
the air of defeat has arisen because of the complicated dispute 
that has tied up congressional leaders for the past week 
republican senators are preparing to force the chamber to vote 
on a plan to lower the capital gains tax in an effort to honor 
bushs campaign pledge for a cut in the rate bush says a rate cut 
will stimulate economic activity and boost federal revenues 
democratic leaders oppose the idea arguing it would cost the 
government billions of dollars in the long run 
but the democratic leadership is on the defensive realizing 
that most senators favor some capital gains reduction and so they 
are trying to reach an agreement with the gop that would prevent a 
capital gains amendment and other controversial issues from 
being added to the deficitreduction bill 
attaching capital gains language to the budget bill considered 
an urgent mustpass measure would greatly increase prospects for 
a cut in the tax rate 
each party has been seeking parliamentary arrangements for 
voting that would give them procedural advantages in any floor 
votes 
the house also complicated matters last week when it approved an 
11 billion deficitslashing bill of its own that measure included 
a twoyear capital gains cut a shrinkage of medicare benefits for 
extremely ill elderly patients an expansion of federal day care 
programs and other initiatives 
working out a way to pare those items from the legislation and 
for the house and senate to agree to a compromise bill makes it 
all but impossible to finish the task by next monday leaders 
concede 
the time to have stripped the bill down was before we 
enacted it foley told reporters 
the grammrudman cuts will be triggered monday if the projected 
deficit for the 1990 fiscal year which began oct 1 is not below 
110 billion 
the congressional budget office projected tuesday that the 
shortfall will be 1413 billion this would call for cuts of 413 
billion divided evenly between defense and domestic programs 
the cbo projections however are merely advisory the white 
houses office of management and budget issues its binding 
projections monday they are expected to require about 16 billion 
in cuts divided equally between defense and domestic programs 
congress as it has done in the past could undo any cuts with 
future legislation

one canadian school district is selling condoms 
in high school bathrooms and another will start soon in programs 
health experts hope will help guard against unwanted pregnancies 
aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
theyve been installed for two or three weeks says loretta 
nichols chairman of the qualicum school board of trustees in 
british columbia theres been absolutely no vandalism 
theres been much less concern among the students than there is 
among the adults 
qualicum a semirural district on vancouver island placed the 
condom vending machines in one boys and one girlrs room in each of 
its two secondary schools which some 1100 students attend 
weve had excellent familylife programs in place prior to 
this mrs nichols said in a telephone interview tuesday 
the toronto school board voted 153 recently to install condom 
vending machines in its 38 secondary schools in a program that 
could begin by christmas 
students in toronto are being taught that the best method for 
preventing aids is abstention but that condoms can cut the risk 
significantly 
the decision was made after dr perry kendall torontos medical 
health officer reported 47 known positive tests for the aids virus 
among local teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 he estimated 
that there may be as many as nine more positive tests for each one 
known 
jim brown spokesman for the us public health service in 
washington dc said he knew of no high schools in the united 
states that provide condomdispensing machines 
you would have problems in the local communities etc 
etc he said by telephone 
mrs nichols said the decision in qualicum was made strictly for 
health reasons without being aware the district would be 
considered in the vanguard 
we had no idea whether it was done anywhere else in canada 
and it really didnt concern us she said the board approached 
the situation on the basis of health prevention and left the moral 
aspect completely aside 
the vote was 6 to 1 in favor 
a major factor was that area pharmacies close at 6 pm so young 
people might find it difficult to purchase condoms mrs nichols 
said while life in a small town also might discourage them 
because were a small area its difficult for a student to go 
in to a drugstore and be anonymous she said 
the machines that sell condoms for 50 cents each 43 cents us 
were installed by a supplier on a fourmonth trial basis 
the toronto district plans to purchase machines for 200 each 
then sell condoms it buys for 18 cents each at a 
yettobedetermined price educational programs are planned for 
students teachers and parents before the machines are installed 
none of us has ignored or downplayed the distress with which 
some parents will receive this plan kendall said during the 
debate yet in this instance the harm of not acting far 
outweighs potential censure 
he said that teenagers consider themselves immune to the 
possibility of getting pregnant or contracting a disease 
canada had reported 3040 aids cases as of tuesday 
encouraging students to buy condoms will not end the misery of 
unwanted teenage pregnancies of the transmittal of sexual 
diseases of teenage abortions torontos globe and mail 
newspaper said in an editorial it will reduce the numbers 
however 
by addressing the issue openly schools may give some 
teenagers the strength to make protection an issue when 
considering sexual intercourse and the knowledge that at least one 
form of protection is readily available it said 
the decision on condom machines is up to local school boards 
the scarborough school board which has 24 secondary schools in 
torontos eastern suburban area decided against installing the 
machines 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
the scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency 
virus or hiv

the congressmen who filed an ethics complaint 
against house republican whip newt gingrich says the house ethics 
committee is delaying a decision on whether to investigate 
gingrichs financial dealings 
rep bill alexander dark complained in a letter to the 
committee that a chicago law firm hired to recommend whether an 
investigation should begin has not interviewed many witnesses who 
are willing to testify against gingrich 
alexander said tuesday he had retained his own attorney to 
review the committees progress following his complaint that 
gingrich a georgia republican may have violated house rules and 
campaign finance laws 
but he wrote the committee it was easier to find evidence 
supporting his allegations than to find evidence of an 
investigative effort by the committeehired firm 
the ethics committee formally the committee on standards of 
official conduct hired phelan pope and john ltd the firm that 
served as the panels special counsel in the case against former 
speaker jim wright wright resigned from congress in june after the 
committee charged him with 69 rules violations 
alexander filed an ethics complaint against gingrich april 11 
and amended the document on july 14 but said he has received no 
response from the committee 
the committee denied alexanders request for information on the 
phelan firms progress writing him that house rules prohibit 
disclosure of the information 
the complaint said gingrich may have violated campaign finance 
laws house limits on outside income and a house rule preventing 
acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in 
legislation 
many of the allegations center on gingrichs formation of a 
partnership including political supporters to promote the 1984 
book he coauthored window of opportunity there also were 
questions about the use of gingrich staffers to work on the book 
gingrich has denied any violations although he said last month 
that his congressional staff did clerical work on the book he said 
house rules permit such activity as long as the book deals with a 
public policy issue and the staffers work at least 40 hours a week 
on congressional duties

the captain of the uss iowa says the navy 
staffed his ship with dopers marginal performers and other 
lowquality sailors who had been kicked off other ships according 
to a published report 
capt fred p moosally complained to the officer investigating 
the turret explosion that killed 47 sailors in april that he 
believed the ship was kind of out of it when he took over 
command in may 1988 
the navy however said the iowas crew was no worse than any 
other ships crew 
i think the battleship has not been properly taken care of as 
far as manning goes in the wardroom the officers on a warship or 
the enlisted area moosally told rear adm richard milligan the 
chief investigator of the iowa explosion 
moosally said some of the sailors sent to the ship were 
dopers marginal performers constant uas unauthorized 
absences 
a transcript of the captains remarks in the may interview was 
obtained by the navy times which published them in its oct 9 
edition 
the navy said its investigation concluded the explosion in the 
gun turret was probably detonated on purpose by a suicidal sailor 
who was upset at the breakup of a friendship with one sailor and at 
another shipmates rejection of his homosexual advances 
milligan asked moosally why he let sailors with criminal records 
and disciplinary problems handle ammunition in violation of navy 
regulations 
moosally said he would be hardpressed if i was to disqualify 
all the guys ive got on iowa that have problems 
ive got guys that were kicked out of submarines kicked out 
of sps shore patrol that ive got as gunners mates the 
captain said thats what the navy sends me 
the navy denied that lowquality sailors and officers were 
assigned to the ship 
the four battleships in the navy get their fair share of the 
best and worst lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman told 
the newspaper 
adm la edney vice chief of naval operations wrote in the 
oct 16 edition of navy times that moosallys remarks were taken 
out of context 
the questioning took place quite soon after the tragedy while 
both the captain and the navy were searching their minds for 
possible causes and while the grief he suffered could best be 
described as an open wound edney wrote 
earlier this month the navy gave moosally a letter of caution 
for violations of training and other regulations that were found 
during the investigation of the explosion these violations the 
navy said had nothing to do with the explosion

a pentagon spokesman says a decision on 
whether to replace military editors at the armed forces newspaper 
stars and stripes with civilians wont be made until an ombudsman 
submits a report on the question 
the comment by pete williams came a day after he told reporters 
monday when the current military editors retire it is our 
intention to put civilians in there 
but williams said at a pentagon briefing tuesday im not 
denying anything that i said yesterday im just saying that we do 
have an ombudsman and it would be well for me to let him make his 
recommendations first 
the decision to switch from military to civilian editors would 
comply with a recommendation in a report last year by the general 
accounting office 
the gao assisted by the society of professional journalists 
reported that it found evidence of censorship and improper 
management at the governmentrun daily 
the gao recommended the editorinchief be a civilian with solid 
journalism credentials rather than a military officer 
williams earlier statement had been warmly greeted by those who 
have been pressing for such a change but it apparently caught the 
ombudsman former washington post editor philip m foisie off 
guard 
foisie reached in tokyo said williams had misspoke 
i think he got confused foisie said im doing a study i 
havent made any report yet a decision of the kind mentioned by 
mr williams would not be made until my report 
foisie who was appointed last summer to help deal with the 
allegations of censorship has been in the far east for more than 
two weeks visiting bureaus of the overseas paper and investigating 
its problems 
williams said that even if the changes occur i anticipate 
that there will always be a military commander of the newspaper 
now how you divide up editorial responsibilities is something that 
were asking mr foisie to advise us on 
although frequently referred to as one newspaper the stars and 
stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous 
bureaus in west germany and japan

drug traffickers claimed responsibility 
for the assassination of two employees of a crusading antidrug 
newspaper and threatened to kill its remaining 11 workers in 
medellin if they dont leave 
a magazine journalist and four other people also were gunned 
down tuesday in colombias cocaine trafficking capital 
the shootings in medellin followed 13 bombings in three other 
colombian cities late monday and early tuesday the most serious 
rash of attacks since the countrys drug lords went to war with the 
government nearly two months ago 
last month a car bomb exploded outside the main officies in 
bogota of the 102yearold el espectador newspaper injuring scores 
of bystanders and causing extensive damage 
in a telephone call to el espectador a man said a group called 
the extraditables would kill the 11 members of the papers medellin 
staff if they did not leave the city in three days an editor at 
the paper said the staff is composed of journalists secretaries 
and administrative workers 
the anonymous caller said the extraditables was responsible for 
tuesdays assassinations in medellin of the papers administrator 
and circulation manager for the city of 2 million said the editor 
who asked not to be identified for security reasons 
drug traffickers have issued statements under the name the 
extraditables the countrys top cocaine barons fear extradition to 
the united states which seeks to put them on trial 
in announcing the antidrug campaign president virgilio barco 
put in place emergency decrees restoring an extradition treaty with 
the united states and empowering security forces to seize the 
property of cocaine bosses 
millions of dollars in property allegedly belonging to the 
traffickers has since been seized but only one reputed highlevel 
drug figure has been extradited to the united states

espectadors administrator martha luz lopez 35 and its 
circulation manager miguel soler 45 both employees were shot by 
unidentified gunmen traveling on motocycles 
police said gunmen later tuesday killed roberto sarasty the 
55yearold director of cronista democratica magazine while he was 
walking on a downtown street with another journalist his companion 
was slightly wounded 
at about the same time another group fired at a crowd at a bar 
in manrique a northern medellin barrio killing four people before 
fleeing manrique is a known recruiting ground for sicarios or 
assassins used by drug traffickers 
police said that they not been able to establish the motives for 
the killings of sarasty or the four people in manrique 
the el espectador editor denied local radio reports that the 
papers owner had decided to close the medellin offices because of 
the assassinations and threats 
however one of the papers owners speaking in monterrey 
mexico at the annual conference of the inter american press 
association said el espectador may close its medellin office 
i dont know if well be able to continue operating in 
medellin under present conditions said luis gabriel cano whose 
brother guillermo cano was killed by cocaine traffickers on dec 
17 1986 
cano also said the paper founded in medellin in 1887 may have 
to close eventually because of financial problems caused by the 
bombing last month 
a senior el espectador reporter asking not to be identified 
said in a telephone interview that none of the papers 1200 
employees have quit although many had received death threats 
the reporter said drug traffickers were trying to destroy the 
paper by decimating its staff and that more assassinations may 
occur 
security cant be increased any more weve already got 50 
soldiers guarding our facilities bodyguards for all our managers 
and dynamitesniffing dogs roaming our halls he said what 
else can be done 
el espectador has been a strong supporter of the governments 
antidrug offensive which began after the assassination aug 18 of 
leading presidential candidate luis carlos galan 
in an effort to help the newspaper survive many us papers 
have expressed support through large paid advertisements placed in 
the paper

abc had seven of network televisions top 10 
programs last week but nbc narrowly rode the cosby show and the 
baseball playoffs into first place in the ac nielsen co ratings 
abc finished within 08 point of nbc and its roseanne was 
the highest rated program of the week 
abc has the contract to carry the world series between the 
oakland athletics and san francisco giants 
the last such regional contest in 1985 between the kansas city 
royals and st louis cardinals went seven games and was a ratings 
winner for abc but the asgiants contest has the disadvantage of 
being on the west coast 
that means all the games will have to start two hours before 
prime time at 5 pm in their respective cities so east coast 
viewers can catch the first pitch at 8 pm 
this world series is not a regional matchup insisted jack 
ohara abcs director of sports programming the two teams are 
national attractions with very recognizable superstars 
if abc called us up and said hey we dont like this 
oaklandgiants matchup wed take it said preston beckman 
nbcs vice president of sports audience research 
nbc led the three networks for the 68th consecutive week with 
an average rating of 152 to abcs 144 and cbs 125 
the ratings are the percentage of the estimated 904 million 
homes with television sets in the united states

head of the class abc and murder she wrote cbs 
national league games did better than american league contests 
during the playoffs with the giantscubs matches on sunday and 
thursday nights tying for 12th place in the ratings the first game 
for the national league series on wednesday night was in 17th 
place while the third game on saturday night was no 19 
two american league games were played in prime time with the 
tuesday night game between the athletics and the toronto blue jays 
in 36th place and the friday game at no 38 
one of the two teams in the american league was a canadian

the widow of a rebel defense forces 
captain vowed at his funeral to obtain justice for the man she said 
was killed in prison after the failed attempt to topple gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
i will shout it to the world until justice is done and the 
truth is known luz elaine lorenzo said tuesday as she dried 
tears from her eyes at her husbands coffin 
she denied rumors that capt nicasio lorenzo had hanged himself 
after the coup attempt oct 3 the coroners report said he died of 
asphyxiation 
at the funeral she called him a very catholic man a god to 
his children and they are not going to sully his name 
lorenzo 36 was one of 27 officers arrested after the coup 
attempt he was an adjutant to former intelligence chief col 
guillermo wong who was also jailed eight rebel officers were 
killed on the day of the coup when troops loyal to noriega put 
down the rebellion 
the government has denied reports some coup leaders were 
executed after they surrendered 
america torres de mcenfresh lorenzos motherinlaw said the 
family was told monday morning by the district attorneys office to 
pick up his body at the morgue 
i saw him for the last time on tuesday morning oct 3 
mrs lorenzo said he did what he always did he went jogging 
came back dressed in civilian clothes very sporty we kissed and 
then he left at about 730 am 
he never would have committed suicide she told reporters 
he was a religious man he taught us to love god none took food 
here without blessing it first 
also tuesday the government took new steps against critics of 
noriega decreeing after a cabinet meeting that government 
employees who take part in antigovernment activities may be 
fired 
many government employees were reported to have celebrated and 
taunted their supervisors while rebels held the military 
headquarters on oct 3 thinking the coup had been a success 
the government also decreed laws tuesday that freeze wages of 
public employees and cancel christmas and yearend bonuses 
in another move against a perennial critic the government 
eliminated the education ministrys national personnel board which 
assigned teaching positions 
a communique said the new laws were intended to protect the 
economy and the national security from the aggression of the us 
government the past two years 
they are repressive measures said ricardo arias calderon 
leader of the opposition christian democrat party i think they 
are the first steps toward developing a police state 
noriega in announcing last week that the laws were forthcoming 
said here there will be no room for traitors nor jobs for the 
traitors an apparent reference to the government employees 
as chief of the defense forces noriega is the real power in the 
government 
also tuesday the government said it will send representatives 
to the oct 2328 meeting of the panama canal commissions board of 
directors in tampa fla it had boycotted the last two meetings of 
the joint uspanamanian board saying washington might bring up 
the political conflict between the two countries 
since noriega was indicted in february 1988 on charges of 
smuggling drugs into the united states and laundering drug money 
washington has been applying economic sanctions and other pressures 
on panama to force noriega out 
noriega denies involvement in drug trafficking and claims the 
united states is trying to force him out because it wants to renege 
on 1977 treaties that cede control of the panama canal by the end 
of the century

along the 10000foot ridges of central 
asias tien shan mountains where few westerners have set foot 
veterans of the vietnam and afghanistan wars shared battlefield 
memories and a desire for peace 
the americans most of them former marines special forces 
troops or paratroopers recalled how fellow soldiers in vietnam 
were killed or wounded by gunfire from ak47 assault rifles 
supplied by the soviet union 
soviet veterans also from elite combat units offered similar 
accounts of how their comrades fell victim to handheld stinger 
missiles that the united states had shipped to the afghan rebels 
we talked about that quite openly said bob rheault the 
leader of the us group and then wed think about what would 
happen if we started shooting at each other with our own weapons 
wed end the planet said the retired army colonel 
for eight days last month about 35 us and soviet veterans 
trekked across some of the worlds most spectacular and forbidding 
terrain in an expedition that reflected the spirit of glasnost the 
soviets policy of openness that is responsible for a growing 
number of exchange programs 
earthstewards network of bainbridge island wash a nonprofit 
educational group that seeks to promote citizen diplomacy had 
invited rheault to lead the expedition and recruit participants 
a soviet veterans group organized the itinerary the americans 
had no idea of their destination until they arrived 
it was a great adventure said retired lt gen hal moore 
who commanded a 1st cavalry division battalion in the ia drang 
valley the landmark 1965 battle between us and north vietnamese 
forces 
moore 67 of crested butte colo was surprised at the ease 
with which he and the other americans were accepted by the younger 
soviet veterans many of the americans were a generation older 
they called me their brother and they wanted me to call them 
my little brothers moore said i thought they might call me 
grandfather 
the route traversed a range of remote and barren mountains that 
cuts across western china into the soviet union east of tashkent 
despite language barriers each group had two interpreters 
and the age differences the former soldiers forged a common bond 
according to members of the us contingent 
attitudes toward the respective wars were strikingly similar 
rheault said citing the example of one of the soviets who 
displayed knife wounds from handtohand combat in afghanistan the 
soviets completed their troop withdrawal from afghanistan earlier 
this year 
he was proud of having been a good soldier but he was not 
happy at having been sent to fight that stupid war rheault said 
rheault a former commander of us special forces troops is no 
stranger to controversy he and five green beret subordinates were 
arrested by the army in 1969 on charges of killing a south 
vietnamese civilian who was an alleged double agent rheault was 
jailed 70 days before the army abruptly dropped the charges 
rheault went on to develop innovative outdoor adventure programs 
at the hurricane island outward bound school in maine he said the 
tien shan expedition reinforced the belief that communication 
improves hopes for peace between the superpowers 
at the end of a days climb the vietnam veterans sang where 
have all the flowers gone and other songs of the era the soviets 
shared their protest songs including the mournful black tulip 
which took its name from the helicopter that lifted out bodies of 
dead soviet soldiers 
we had so much in common that it transcended our 
differences said the 63yearold rheault we certainly felt a 
lot closer to each other than any of us felt to our own 
politicians

rock fans and opera lovers were enthusiastic 
about the world premiere of an opera written by stewart copeland 
the former drummer with the rock group police a newspaper review 
though wasnt so kind 
the idea of a rock star moving into the opera world is very 
exciting said 22yearold brent brown of painesville a 
longtime fan 
hes bringing new ideas to high opera said brown dressed 
for tuesday nights premiere in a tuxedo and red bow tie 
a companion david dunham 28 also of painesville said the 
opera holy blood and crescent moon was a good mix for new 
people you need that 
dunham a fan of opera said that the orchestrated score needs 
a little work the actual singing is good 
but a reviewer for the plain dealer newspaper found problems 
copelands score rises only at a few isolated moments to 
anything that makes us care about his characters it is full of 
nervous orchestral busywork the review said 
dunham said the capacity audience at the ornate state theater 
included many more young people than the typical opera audience 
i wouldnt expect to see them here for carmen he said 
copeland who spent six years with police and later wrote scores 
for movies and television shows took four years to write holy 
blood and crescent moon a tale of the crusades in the middle 
east 
the 37yearold decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984 
while he was composing music for a ballet for shakespeares king 
lear for the san francisco ballet 
his opera will be performed thursday through sunday at the state 
theater and in march 1991 in fort worth texas

jupiters great red spot is getting 
redder following a color change by a 6200milewide belt of 
clouds scientists said as nasa prepares for the galileos sixyear 
mission to the planet 
this is a dynamical neat place to look at its changing and 
doing wild things on a huge scale said rita beebe an astronomer 
at new mexico state university 
british astronomer gm hurst on july 16 first noticed that 
jupiters 6200milewide southern equatorial belt was changing 
from brown to white 
since then the great red spot a hurricane almost twice 
earths size that faded to dim grey in 1976 has been returning 
gradually to its brick red color beebe said tuesday by phone from 
las cruces nm 
the red spot appears to be darkening color seems to be coming 
back said stephen omeara an associate editor at sky amp 
telescope magazine in cambridge mass some observe it as orange 
some pink it has a pale luster 
the national aeronautics and space administration had hoped to 
launch space shuttle atlantis on thursday carrying the galileo 
probe into earth orbit where it will be deployed on its flight to 
jupiter but the agency late tuesday delayed the launch at least 
until at least monday because of a computer problem aboard the 
shuttle 
scientists study weather on jupiter and other planets to 
understand earths climate and rules governing weather on planets 
said beebe who watches jupiter using a 24inch telescope at her 
universitys tortugas mountain observatory near las cruces 
galileo will examine jupiters vast storms and jetstreamlike 
belts when it arrives in 1995 at the solar systems largest planet 
which is 11 times wider than earth and 318 times heavier 
the great red spot which is at least 350 years old and measures 
about 12400 miles east to west and 6200 miles north to south is 
continuing to get redder and about six months from now will 
settle down as a beautiful oval red spot beebe said 
the darkening is being caused by the changing color of the 
southern equatorial belt which sits just north of the spot she 
said 
the belt faded from brown to white in the early 1970s then 
turned brown again in 1974 said glenn orton a planetary scientist 
at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena 
it appears brown when sunlight hits natural gas or methane and 
ammonia to create yellowbrown photochemical smog which drifts 
down in jupiters atmosphere and absorbs light hitting the 
atmosphere beebe said 
she said the belt changes to white when jupiters internal heat 
pushes enough ammonia ice crystals upward where winds up to 330 
mph spread the crystals out to form a white deck of 
lightreflecting cirrus clouds 
beebe said that when the belt is brown eddies in its winds 
start feeding ammonia ice crystals into the great red spot so 
white ice washes out the red color 
when the belt turns white again the eddies diminish reducing 
the amount of ice entering the spot and allowing it to start 
turning dark red she added 
during august and september orton studied the belt through the 
infrared telescope facility nasas heatmeasuring telescope on 
hawaiis mauna kea volcano he found the southern equatorial belt 
had cooled considerably showing icy clouds were blocking heat from 
warmer atmospheric gases below 
beebe said the belt will turn brown again within about 18 months 
as violent storms mix atmospheric gases

police found the bound bodies of 80 
murdered young sinhalese men along a road in southern sri lanka 
today a day before the final round of peace talks to try to 
resolve ethnic conflicts that have claimed more than 16000 lives 
the bodies were found along a 20mile stretch of road between 
the towns of panadura and mataguma in kalutara district 25 miles 
south of colombo said police officials who cannot be identified 
under briefing rules 
the victims all between age 18 and 30 had their hands tied 
behind their backs before they were shot to death police said the 
bodies some of them burning were found in groups of six or eight 
they said 
no one claimed responsibility for the massacre one of the worst 
this year but authorities blamed progovernment death squads 
seeking revenge for the murder monday of three sinhalese soldiers 
in kalutara district 
authorities claimed the peoples liberation front ambushed the 
soldiers while they were on patrol 
human rights groups and opposition politicians have alleged that 
vigilante groups are killing sympathizers of the front an 
extremist sinhalese group trying to overthrow the government 
president ranasinghe premadasa and his government have denied 
the charge and have invited the international committee of the red 
cross to monitor their human rights practices 
the front has been attacking the sinhalesedominated government 
since the signing of a peace accord in july 1987 designed to give 
greater autonomy to the island nations tamil minority 
after premadasa took office in january the bloody conflict 
within the indian ocean island nations sinhalese majority 
instensified claiming an average of 25 lives every day 
more than 5000 people have died in the past two years in 
central and southern sri lanka where most of the countrys 
sinhalese majoriy live 
another 11000 have died in the northeast where most tamils 
live and where tamil guerrillas have been waging a 6yearold 
battle for a separate homeland 
the peoples liberation front espouses marxism but increasingly 
has taken up a banner of ultranationalism for the sinhalese who 
are mostly buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the countrys 16 
million people 
tamils account for 18 percent of the population and are mainly 
hindus 
last month premadasa convened a peace conference of 21 of the 
countrys 27 recognized political parties tamil guerrilla groups 
including the largest and most militant liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam participated in the meeting the front however boycotted 
the talks 
the conference is scheduled to hold its final round of talks on 
thursday

colombian police and soldiers working sometimes 
in concert with drug traffickers and paramilitary groups have 
illegally killed 2500 people in 17 months amnesty international 
said today 
an additional 250 victims disappeared after being taken into 
custody in 1988 and the first five months of this year and some 
were tortured while being held the international human rights 
group said in a report 
amnesty said that last year alone it documented more than 30 
group killings in which a total of 350 people died 
it said local rights groups estimate more than 70 incidents 
occurred involving groups of five or more victims 
victims have included trade union leaders human rights workers 
teachers priests peasants and more recently members of the 
judiciary trying to investigate rights abuses it said 
many recent mass killings appear to have been part of a campaign 
to eliminate people thought to support opposition parties 
londonbased amnesty said 
available information on the organization and functioning of 
socalled death squads provides compelling evidence that 
paramilitary forces form an integral part of a counterinsurgency 
program adopted by the colombian armed forces often operating 
with powerful drug groups designed to eliminate perceived 
opponents without recourse to the law the report said 
in one of the worst cases it said 43 people including three 
children were massacred in segovia a goldmining town in 
antioquia province by heavily armed men who arrived in in pickup 
trucks on nov 11 1988 
some assailants were reportedly hooded and in camouflage uniform 
amnesty said preliminary judicial investigations established 
that army and police personnel were directly responsible for 
preparing the attack which was apparently directed at supporters 
of the opposition group patriotic union 
it said colombias supreme court overruled a military courts 
claim of jurisdiction and handed the case back to the civilian 
court that had been pursuing it 
a civilian court judge investigating the case is one of several 
judges who received death threats in recent months it said other 
members of the judiciary were killed including two civilian judges 
investigating alleged rights abuses 
amnesty said it welcomed measures by president virgilio barco to 
combat drug traffickers but was concerned that equally vigorous 
measures were not announced against members of the armed forces 
and paramilitary groups accused of systematic rights violations 
it said civilian members and supporters of paramilitary death 
squads have declared their intention to continue their activities 
amnesty asked colombia to ensure strict control over all 
branches of the police and security forces and take whatever steps 
are needed to ensure they act within the law 
it said that where evidence exists of security force personnel 
involvement in rights abuses perpetrators must be prosecuted and 
judiciary officials investigating alleged rights abuses must be 
given protection and resources

youd have to wonder about a guy who 
claimed he was a cia spy a mobster a doctor the armys youngest 
major general elvis presleys pal and a hero who rescued scores of 
pows from vietnam 
his girlfriend did and after she checked robert s lyons story 
with the secret service they arrested him 
lyons a 35yearold mission kan salesman of water 
purification systems pleaded guilty in july to impersonating a cia 
agent and a major general and was sentenced tuesday to 15 months of 
psychiatric treatment 
us district judge earl e oconnor said lyons has a history 
of falsehoods that cant be substantiated other than through his 
words 
lyons exgirlfriend beth hannah of overland park said lyons 
was charming quickwitted and full of stories 
he was a gentleman she said he always held the door 
open 
ms hannah 45 nearly married him and cindy cohen 35 also of 
overland park did both suffered financially for believing his 
stories and both attended his sentencing 
he was a master of manipulation ms cohen said an 
absolute master 
he would make a tremendous writer ms hannah said its a 
waste 
ms cohen recalled robert was constantly lying he would go 
from day to day minute to minute building one story on another 
lyons left the army as a private but he wrote an article about 
himself in a bogus newsletter 
the story recounts how general lyons led a commando team in 1983 
to southeast asia rescued 285 prisoners of war and returned with 
the remains of 300 servicemen it said he received two medals of

authorities are investigating whether a 
man whose body was found near railroad tracks was traveling with 
four others found dead in a trailer being carried on a railroad 
flatcar 
the four thought to be illegal aliens were found tuesday 
morning on the southern pacific train and authorities were trying 
to determine if a toxic pesticide used on the cargo contributed to 
their deaths 
later authorities found the body of a man also believed to be 
an illegal alien beside the tracks just south of sinton 65 miles 
south of victoria authorities said tuesday night 
san patricio county sheriff leroy moody said its possible the 
man died in the same railroad car and fell out 
moody said a crewman on a union pacific train spotted the fifth 
body about 10 feet from the tracks tuesday afternoon 
autopsies on all five were ordered 
the trailer halffilled with boxes of tortilla or corn flour 
called masa had two warning stickers about the size of license 
plates taped to the doors the signs showed skulls and said in 
english and spanish danger this trailer is being fumigated 
and do not enter 
the masa had been fumigated with phostoxin an aluminum 
phosphate pesticide before the trailer was sealed and loaded on 
the train in harlingen said jorge trevino quality control manager 
for the flour producer azteca milling co in edinburg 
the pesticides are used on masa shipments to keep the food free 
of rodents and bugs trevino did not know when a contractor had 
treated and sealed the trailer which measured about 40 feet long 
8 feet tall and 10 feet wide 
anne cuddeback an investigator with the texas department of 
health said the fumigant used in the trailer could be fatal if 
inhaled or ingested 
the four apparently died of asphyxiation despite punching a 
small hole in the trailer probably for ventilation said victoria 
police lt jack williams 
three rescue workers and seven police officers at the scene were 
taken to a hospital after some complained of nausea and vomiting 
said police lt richard jones 
the symptoms of the fumigant are diarrhea and vomiting which 
was found inside the car said police sgt john burney 
the victims appeared to be in their 20s he said three of the 
four had papers although police hadnt verified the documents 
tuesday one had a mexican passport one had documents from 
honduras and a third had papers that had been stamped in el 
salvador but indicated he was from venezuela jones said 
a border patrol agent said the patrol is working through the 
mexican consul to identify the men 
the patrol is investigating whether smugglers put the men in the 
trailer and whether other illegal aliens broke the door open later 
said brian french agentincharge for the patrols corpus christi 
area 
tuesdays discovery was the latest in a series of deaths since 
1980 after illegal aliens crossed into the united states 
on july 2 1987 18 mexican men suffocated inside a locked 
railroad boxcar they had come across the border into the 
missouripacific freight yard at el paso a smuggler had locked the 
men inside the insulated box car that later was parked for hours in 
the desert sun at sierra blanca about 90 miles east of el paso

the governor today announced plans for a new 
airport and port complex costing 16 billion that is designed to 
boost confidence in the british colony before china takes over in 
1997 
the tworunway airport to be built on an offshore island and 
landfill and a new highspeed rail system and sixlane highway 
linking it to urban areas will be the territorys largest 
construction project ever 
by pressing ahead with such ambitious programs despite the 
special pressures which our community has so recently faced the 
government is demonstrating its commitment to hong kongs future 
governor sir david wilson said in his annual speech on the state of 
the colony 
the announcement comes as the government tries to restore 
confidence in the territory which was severely shaken by the harsh 
crackdown on dissent in china in june 
many residents are concerned about what will happen when the 
territory is handed to communist china in 1997 even though beijing 
has promised hong kong can maintain its capitalist system for 50 
years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
in addressing those concerns wilson said a draft bill of rights 
that would allow people to seek redress in courts if they believe 
their civil or political rights are violated would be ready by july 
1990 
but he did not discuss the increased political tension of recent 
days between hong kong and china that has exacerbated the 
confidence crisis 
beijing was angered by the colonys decision last month to allow 
a chinese swimmer who had sought political asylum to fly to the 
united states it retaliated by refusing for the first time to 
accept the return of chinese caught entering hong kong illegally 
the move has sparked fears in the colony of a flood of illegal 
immigrants 
wilson devoted much of his speech to the massive construction 
projects that promise to change the face of this territory of 57 
million people 
physically hong kong will have changed almost beyond 
recongition he said 
the centerpiece of the program is a new airport at chek lap kok 
about 15 miles west of downtown hong kong which will replace the 
colonys existing airport famed for a harrowing flight path that 
forces approaching aircraft to seemingly skim rooftops of the 
crowded kowloon peninsula 
the new airport which should open by early 1997 will operate 
24 hours a day and be able to handle 80 million passengers a year 
that is more than three times the maximum capacity of the existing 
facility 
a town for at least 150000 people as well as industrial and 
commercial facilities will be built near the new airport 
hong kong also will construct what amounts to a completely new 
port on the western side of the territory not far from the 
airport wilson said a large breakwater between two offshore 
islands will be built to increase sheltered anchorage and a new 
shipping channel will be dredged 
the price of the projects is expected to be about 1628 
billion wilson said although he did not provide specifics on 
financing the government has more than 897 billion in surplus 
wilson also mentioned an aggressive land reclamation policy that 
will expand the downtown area about 990 feet into the colonys 
famed harbor in addition the site of the existing airport will be 
redeveloped 
the governor failed to break new ground on political issues such 
as bringing democratic change to hong kong and giving a segment of 
the population the right to emigrate to great britain 
political commentator joseph ys cheng said the speech will 
have a fairly neutral effect on the confidence of hong kong 
people in the future he has done what he can what he said has 
already been anticipated 
hong kong people probably realize that their future is not 
determined by these wellwritten highly diplomatic policy speeches 
by the governor but by the political situation in china he said 
the speech had little impact on the hong kong stock exchange 
widely viewed as a barometer of public sentiment stocks fell 
slightly in the afternoon 
philip niem research director at the stock brokerage hoare 
govett asia ltd said the plan for a new airport had generally 
been expected since 1983 
this wont necessarily influence foreign investors i dont 
think it is the key issue the key issue is still china he said

the fbi has joined the 
investigation into the vandalism crossburning and threats against 
a family of ukrainian christians 
the bureau is looking into possible civil rights violations 
against vladimir and ekaterina doroshkevich and their eight 
children who resettled in the area two months ago 
a cross was found burning on the familys lawn sunday morning 
and antirussian slogans were spraypainted on the calvary assembly 
of god church that is sponsoring their resettlement 
the pastor the rev mike smith received a telephoned death 
threat directed against his family and the doroshkeviches 
lt james moeller of the white bear lake police department said 
police are analyzing evidence and so far the incidents appear to 
be the work of a single person 
its far too early to theorize but theres nothing at all to 
suggest this is anything more than an isolated incident from an 
individual a misguided individual he said theres nothing to 
suggest a group or an organized activity 
the harassment that doroshkeviches have suffered is the first 
aimed at any of the more than 10000 soviet christians who have 
immigrated to the united states since 1988 said judi jankowski of 
the minnesota chapter of world relief an arm of the national 
association of evangelicals 
on tuesday the church received scores of phone calls after news 
reports of the harassment and vandalism almost all of the callers 
voiced support for the church and the emigres said church 
secretary donna boyum 
she said three callers criticized the resettlement of the 
doroshkeviches who say they suffered religious persecution in 
their soviet homeland and spent 12 years trying to emigrate more 
than 60 callers had a positive message she said 
weve had offers of donations food and clothing people who 
want to write notes of support to the family other churches 
putting them on their prayer chain boyum said people 
generally are shocked that anyone would do something like this 
the twin cities area human rights coalition planned to hold a 
session today allowing representatives of various religious 
organizations to speak out against the incidents 
we fear this is an example of the xenophobia that seems to be 
occurring in our country in which some people are threatened by 
any kind of difference whatsoever said carol wirtschafter 
assistant director of the jewish community relations council 
antidefamation league of minnesota and the dakotas

homesickness has prompted the 
return of more than 50 east germans who fled their strict communist 
homeland for the west in the past month a border official says 
nearly 50000 east germans have arrived in west germany since 
sept 11 when hungary removed restrictions on crossing its western 
border 
many refugees cried tears of joy when they arrived but west 
german officials have cautioned that many would face personal 
problems as they tried to fit into a new society 
wolfgang schlee spokesman for bavarian border police said 
tuesday that 54 refugees who arrived since sept 11 already had 
returned and he expected more to do so 
homesickness is the key he said by telephone from munich 
many of them miss their friends its for personal reasons 
in some cases its a question of wives children and parents 
left behind alone or in need of care 
he noted that many brought only the most necessary things with 
them most of what they owned was left behind 
speculation has arisen about how the refugees would be treated 
if they returned home but schlee said he doubted they would face 
the harshness of the past 
east germany severely punishes what it calls flight from the 
republic armed guards fences and the berlin wall are designed 
to block escape over the years thousands of east germans have 
been sent to prison after being caught fleeing 
official news media in east germany have given prominence to 
statements from those who left and returned after becoming 
disillusioned in west germany they regulary carry bleak 
descriptions of life in west germany insisting that unemployment 
and housing shortages are rampant

voters cast ballots today to choose local 
councils that could reform the citys muchmaligned school system 
by giving parents a direct say in their childrens education 
the bad education system is really crippling the city said 
donald moore executive director of designs for change an 
education research and advisory group that helped shape the reform 
package whether you have kids in school or not its important 
chicagos school system the nations third largest with 410000 
students has had low test scores and high dropout rates in 1987 
theneducation secretary william bennett called the system the 
nations worst 
under a reform package passed last year by the illinois general 
assembly elections are being held today at the citys 469 
elementary schools and thursday at the 71 public high schools to 
take much power out of administratorss hands and turn it over 
largely to parents 
among other things the councils will have the authority to hire 
and fire principals develop schoolimprovement plans and spend 
money 
i think people understand the significance moore said 
the best indicator of that is that we have 17000 candidates and 
therefore we will have contested selections for almost all 
positions on the councils 
each council will include six parents two teachers and two 
community residents without schoolchildren school staffs will 
elect the teacher members the 11th member of each council will be 
the principal of the school or schools the council oversees 
a 50 percent turnout among parents with children in schools was 
predicted by community activists and others who spent weeks trying 
to mobilize residents to participate 
im just asking people to take a look at this very seriously 
because to go into it for anything other than helping the kids it 
will not work said mary guytonsmith an atampt clerk seeking a 
community representative spot on the council at farragut high 
school on the citys southwest side 
despite fears that politicians and others would manipulate the 
elections to favor certain candidates moore said election judges 
were hired by the school board to make sure the elections are 
impartial 
project leap legal elections in all precincts a watchdog 
group that monitors regular municipal elections also agreed to 
monitor the voting to watch for improprieties

even though san franciscos mayor wont 
be getting all as from his oakland counterpart hostilities were 
played down as the san francisco giants and oakland athletics 
prepare to meet in the world series 
still oakland mayor lionel wilson wanted to capitalize at a 
press conference tuesday on san francisco mayor art agnos recent 
remark that there wasnt anything in oakland he wanted 
he kind of took a potshot at us recently but im willing to 
let bygones be bygones said wilson beaming in a bright green 
as jacket and cap 
i read this morning that he said he was joking wilson said 
referring to agnos comments well it wasnt a good joke but so 
what 
he pointed out the athletics have won the american league 
pennant two years in a row and won three championships in the time 
its taken the giants to just make it into the series two times 
i appreciate the giants being in the world series im happy 
for them said wilson who reportedly was furious when he first 
heard agnos disparaging statements about his neighbor on the east 
side of the bay bridge 
wilsons peacemaking statements were spoken in the spirit of 
the first inhabitants of oakland the ohlone indians a hunting 
and gathering people said to have maintained such a peaceful 
attitude that they had no word for war 
but the reality is that the world series war is on and so is 
the rivalry between san francisco and oakland 
wilson disclosed that he wrote a letter to agnos about the 
antioakland comments he made last week wilson said agnos called 
him about the letter but he didnt return the calls 
i was too upset and i think i had a legitimate reason ive 
never said anything to try and diminish san francisco said 
74yearold wilson an oakland resident since age 3 
sensing his joke about not wanting anything in oakland had 
gone too far agnos on monday called oakland a great city with a 
great team and a great mayor 
agnos even said there were a few things he wouldnt mind 
winning from oakland if wilson wanted to bet on the world series 
sure ill go high stakes or low stakes agnos said if 
wilson wants to go high stakes ill bet him candlestick park 
against the oakland coliseum if he wants to go low stakes ill 
bet him dinner at flints ribs 
wilson said he hoped for a friendly wager with agnos on the 
series which he predicted the as will win in six games thanks to 
their superior pitching 
he knows a little bit about the sport having played pro ball 
for the california eagles a black team in the days of segregated 
baseball 
before the news conference wilson quipped i know what ill 
bet him maybe ill have a plastic foot made he can put in his 
mouth 
at his own news conference in san francisco agnos told 
reporters tuesday that hes won every bet hes made since becoming 
mayor including one on the super bowl i want to keep the string 
going

at least a few buttoneddown tightcollared 
patrons of elite madison avenue haberdasher paul stuart were aghast 
last month when they received along with their statement a how 
to describe it a flier 
come on down and shop around the thing blared and went on 
to offer if you can imagine this something called a 
skipamonth payment option for and at this point you simply 
must suspend disbelief altogether people strapped by 
backtoschool expenses 
paul stuart inc spokeswoman julie oddy says the flier was 
printed on cheap stock with large block letters and there 
were exclamation points in the text 
even the color was wrong it was green and white the color of 
money complained ms oddy the whole thing was inappropriate 
considering who our customers are and what our image is 
the fliers inclusion in the august statement that is the 
bill came to paul stuarts attention when a customer told a member 
of the grodd family which owns the store the easy credit flier 
seemed out of character three or four other customers also 
telephoned in their complaints 
the fault rested not with paul stuart but with the general 
electric credit corp which provides billing mailing and 
marketing services to stuart and many other stores including 
caldors and zayres 
ge credit spokeswoman lisa van orden said the flier was designed 
for other client stores in an attempt to boost september sales by 
allowing shoppers to skip a minimum payment in september customers 
would however be charged interest on their unpaid balance 
the flier was stuffed in with paul stuart bills without the 
stores knowledge when stuart found out it fired off a letter to 
patrons apologizing for what it termed the rather crass flier 
the letter blamed the fliers inclusion on a mistake by its 
mailing house and assured patrons we would never consider 
addressing you in such a manner 
ge credit admits the mistake but says the skipamonth plan 
is popular with some shoppers executives at paul stuart just 
dont want to bother their high clientele with those kinds of 
marketing tools ms van orden said 
in an interview several years ago patricia grodd daughter of 
stuart owner clifford grodd described that clientele as a cross 
section of people who have achieved in all areas most of the top 
people in every field 
and punctual billpayers too although stuart stood by its 
inadvertent skipamonth offer ms oddy says no one took advantage 
of it

cadet firefighters shot at a crowd of attackers in 
the capital of the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh wounding 
at least eight people an interior ministry spokesman said today 
the confrontation between the cadets and a threatening mob 
occurred tuesday night in stepanakert in the southern soviet union 
said yuri m arshenevsky of the ministrys press office in moscow 
he said eight civilians were in critical condition 
arshenevsky said the cadets were riding in 19 vehicles and 
crossing a bridge into stepanakert when a mob materialized and 
began throwing stones and firing on the passing column he said the 
firefighters were forced to shoot in selfdefense 
but representatives of a proarmenian group nagorno karabakh 
is a predominantly armenian enclave in the republic of azerbaijan 
and the focus of a bloody ethnic dispute said the crowd was 
nonviolent 
ashot manucharyan an armenian legislator from the region said 
in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the karabakh 
committee in yerevan the capital of neighboring armenia that the 
civilians were attracted to the bridge by warning shots fired into 
the air by the cadets 
he claimed one civilian was killed in addition to the eight 
wounded 
the karabakh committee has led the campaign for the annexation 
of nagornokarabakh to armenian jurisdiction azerbaijanis are 
predominantly moslem and most armenians are christians 
it was not clear if the firefighters also were soldiers but 
troops have been stationed in nagornokarabakh to try to keep the 
peace for the past year 
on tuesday leaders of a grassroots azerbaijani movement 
suspended a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel food and 
housing supplies to armenia a member said 
we decided in a directive to open the railroad to armenia as 
of 10 pm ingilap aslanov a member of the peoples front and 
of the groups strike committee said by telephone from the 
azerbaijani capital baku 
he said the strike was suspended until oct 23 to give soviet 
legislators in moscow a chance to respond to azerbaijans demands 
to remove special kremlin administration of nagornokarabakh 
soviet troops moved into the neighboring republics last week to 
break the blockade that has been strangling armenia and 
nagornokarabakh about 400 trains with 60000 cars were reported 
idled 
most supply routes must pass through azerbaijan to reach armenia 
official news media said tuesday that in the previous 24 hours 
authorities managed to push 1748 carloads of supplies through to 
armenia 
but deputy premier lev voronin told the supreme soviet 
legislature that did not include oil products a fuel shortage has 
stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in armenias fields 
reports said freight arriving in armenia under military guard 
was damaged 
aslanov said the azerbaijan peoples front wanted the issue of 
nagornokarabakh taken up by the presidium of the supreme soviet 
the countrys highestranking executive body but settled for 
demanding that the supreme soviet legislature review the question 
if it does not do so by oct 23 the peoples front will call a 
general strike that once again will include the railroads he said 
the peoples front says the rail strike started sept 4 but 
armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through azerbaijan 
dried up almost three months ago 
president mikhail s gorbachev opening the fall session of the 
supreme soviet on sept 25 called for firm steps to break the 
transportation deadlock 
after hearing tuesday from voronin the supreme soviet once 
again called on armenia and azerbaijan to end their dispute

gen manuel antonio noriega had no intention of killing him during 
the several hours they held him hostage a participant told the 
miami herald 
the rebel one of 42 panamanians flown into miami this week 
after seeking refuge at us military bases in their homeland 
spoke on condition that neither his name nor the location where he 
was interviewed be disclosed the newspaper said today he said his 
troops knew him as commander thunder 
he suggested junior officers who took part in the coup attempt 
turned noriega over to their superiors he said the rebels had held 
noriega hostage for several hours last week and could have killed 
him at any time 
there was no intention at any time to kill the man the coup 
participant said 
asked why he said it may have been because a soldier would find 
it hard to execute his top commander 
it may have been their military discipline he said 
in their public proclamations the rebels said they had staged 
the coup to retire noriega and five senior colonels of the 
panamanian defense forces 
among 42 exiles who arrived in miami is capt francisco alvarez 
who was arrested last year for taking part in a march 1988 coup 
attempt against noriega alvarez reportedly was released from jail 
three months ago 
the washington post reported another of those given refuge was 
capt javier licona believed to be the highestranking participant 
in the coup to escape capture 
one of the rebels in florida said the soldiers feared for their 
relatives at home 
noriega is a beast the man said he wont stop at 
anything hes going to take reprisals against our wives our 
children and our parents back in panama

vaslav nijinskys the rite of spring the 
revolutionary ballet that provoked a riot at its paris premiere 76 
years ago is showing the jaded world of the 1980s that it can 
still shock an audience 
when the joffrey ballet presented its revival of the longlost 
nijinsky masterpiece set to igor stravinskys jarringly primitive 
score about 50 spectators stalked silently out of the kennedy 
center opera house during fridays openingnight performance 
choreographed by the legendary nijinsky widely regarded as the 
greatest dancer of the 20th century the ballet received a far more 
tumultuous reception at its theater des champselysees debut in 
paris on may 29 1913 
the audience erupted in catcalls whistles and bawling animal 
sounds when the dancers of the ballets russes de monte carlo 
standing hunched and pigeontoed began stomping obsessively to 
stravinskys frenzied rhythms as they carried out the ancient 
slavic ritual of a maidens sacrifice for the renewal of spring 
fistfights broke out dowagers shrieked and impresario serge 
diaghilev was pelted with fruit when he stood in the balcony to 
plead for order the uproar drowned out conductor pierre monteuxs 
musicians and nijinsky stood on a chair in the wings furiously 
shouting cues to the dancers 
the theater seemed to be shaken by an earthquake wrote an 
artist who sat in the audience that night nijinskys triumph was 
indeed an earthquake that shattered classical ballet traditions 
and marked the violent birth of modern dance 
the joffreys recreation of the original le sacre du 
printemps the rite of spring which was abandoned after 
only eight performances in paris and london in 1913 had its world 
premiere in los angeles two years ago 
it is the highlight of a diaghilev evening at the kennedy 
center running through sunday which also includes nijinskys 
the afternoon of a faun with music by claude debussy and the 
wedding choreographed by nijinskys sister bronislava nijinska 
to music by stravinsky 
it was a ballet program to end all ballet programs wrote 
alan kriegsman of the washington post 
long a dream of the companys late founder robert joffrey the 
reconstruction and staging of the original sacre was the result 
of seven years of painstaking detective work by millicent hodson 
an american dance historian and choreographer and kenneth archer 
a british art historian 
after working with nijinskys former assistant marie rambert 
in london in the mid1950s joffrey met ms hodson a graduate 
student at the university of california at berkeley in 1971 and 
encouraged her to pursue her research on nijinsky and the ballets 
russes 
starting in 1979 with only three blackandwhite photographs of 
dancers from the original sacre production ms hodson embarked 
on a search for scraps of materials to reconstruct the ballet in a 
sketch book 
my dream was that it be performed on stage she said 
in london she met archer who was gathering material for a 
biography of nicholas roerich a russian archeologist and painter 
who designed the sets and costumes for sacre and wrote the 
scenario with stravinsky 
together archer and ms hodson traveled to the soviet union 
the united states france scandinavia and india conducting 
interviews and collecting memoirs costumes sketches and 
handwritten notes from the original production their professional 
collaboration led to marriage in 1982 
they found an oboist who had played in the orchestra pit on 
opening night in paris and sketches left by an artist who drawn 
ballet scenes in crayon from her seat in the darkened theater they 
interviewed the ballet physicians daughter then a 13yearold 
girl who sat in the audience and vividly recalled the astonishing 
scene more than 70 years later 
in 1984 they happened upon what ms hodson called absolute 
gold the single most important document of those seven years of 
research it was a copy of stravinskys rehearsal score 
containing miss ramberts meticulously detailed notes on the 
dancers movements throughout the 34minute ballet 
archer tracked down most of roerichs original sacre 
costumes which had been auctioned in 1969 and were scattered among 
museums and private collections from the soviet union to castle 
howard in england to the university of texas at austin 
this was a phenomenon of dance that had been lost and never 
repeated ms hodson said it was a complex kind of 
choreography a branch that hadnt grown i wanted to see it 
brought back to life onstage so it could continue to grow

the us government changed course today and 
said it would back pacific islanders call for a ban on driftnet 
fishing in their waters and on the high seas 
there is a signal change in us policy thomas a reese iii 
told delegates to the south pacific conference in this us 
territory 
on tuesday the us delegation headed by reese held off 
endorsing a resolution to ban what one delegate called this 
barbarous form of fishing which should be banned everywhere 
reese a deputy assistant administrator for the us agency for 
international development said he needed to consult with the state 
department in washington for what direction to take on the 
resolution 
south pacific nations the american west coast and us 
territories in the pacific including guam and american samoa have 
opposed driftnet fishing by japan south korea and taiwan 
driftnetting has been called the wall of death because nylon 
nets up to 30 miles long and 49 feet deep are used to catch tuna 
the nets trap everything including seals whales sharks 
dolphins turtles and birds 
on tuesday the japanese consul general to guam masao wada 
told the delegates that the driftnet issue should be addressed in a 
scientific practical and friendly manner and not through a 
unilateral ban he said japan plans to reduce its number of fishing 
vessels and also will send an enforcement vessel to the region 
the south pacific conference is the governing body of the south 
pacific commission which provides socioeconomic programs to 
underdeveloped isolated pacific island countries and territories 
the united states australia france new zealand and great 
britain contribute financially to the commission and take part on 
an equal basis with the smaller countries and territories at the 
conference 
in making its policy shift the united states wanted the 
resolution applied to only the smaller pacific islands and to the 
american west coast states hawaii was not mentioned 
but the delegates agreed to include australia and new zealand in 
the area covered by the resolution at the request of those two 
nations 
philippe baude permanent secretary to the south pacific and 
frances delegate questioned whether the resolution might violate 
international law he said the commission has no legal jurisdiction 
over the waters in the south pacific 
pacific islands affected by the resolution include french 
polynesia guam american samoa the cook islands federated states 
of micronesia fiji marshall islands new caledonia the northern 
mariana islands palau papua new guinea the solomon islands

a proposed ban against defacing the american 
flag is headed for final action in the house this week with 
democrats seeking to do the job by statute and republicans urging a 
constitutional amendment 
approval would send the proposed statutory ban to president bush 
for his signature despite his statement last week that he regards 
anything short of a constitutional amendment as inadequate 
the house postponed until thursday a vote originally scheduled 
for today on the bill that would outlaw flag defacement by simple 
statute it already approved the legislation 38038 on sept 12 
but in slightly different form 
meanwhile the senate plans to take up the constitutional 
amendment backed by bush and republican leaders next monday and the 
house plans to consider that measure afterward 
the senate approved the bill on the statute 919 last 
thursday before doing so it made a number of changes and the 
house must pass upon them before the measure can go to the 
presidents desk 
as approved by the senate the bill says whoever knowingly 
mutilates defaces physically defiles burns maintains on the 
floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the united states 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one 
year or both 
the maximum fine would be 1000 
federal law already calls for precisely those penalties for 
defacing the flag supporters of the change say however the 
current statute would likely be ruled unconstitutional by the 
supreme court 
bush called for an amendment after a supreme court ruling in 
june that threw out a texas flagburning case on grounds that the 
state statute was an unconstitutional limit on freedom of speech 
the wording of the federal statute is similar to the texas 
statute 
democratic sponsors designed the latest legislation to ban any 
act of flag defacement without considering whether it is part of a 
political protest they hope that will shield it against any court 
challenge on freespeech grounds 
they are trying to head off an amendment they say would limit 
freedoms guaranteed under the bill of rights in response to an 
isolated flagburning incident 
republican supporters of a constitutional amendment such as 
sen orrin hatch rutah contend no statutory ban on flag burning 
is likely to pass a court test regardless of how carefully it is 
phrased 
all but a few senate republicans however voted for the 
statutory ban sen howard m metzenbaum dohio a critic of both 
the bill and the amendment said some lawmakers probably voted out 
of fear that a no vote would come back to haunt them in 
campaigns 
metzenbaum and several other lawmakers have said however that 
the heat over the issue has subsided since it flared over the 
summer

coast guard and navy crews searched the dark 
waters of the gulf of mexico early today after getting a distress 
call about a charter boat sinking with 18 aboard but officials 
said the sos may have been a hoax 
im sinking and im going into the water a man claiming to 
be a charter boat captain told the coast guard late tuesday said 
petty officer fred kephart 
seventeen life vests and a fiveperson raft were available on 
the 64foot fishing boat the man said reportedly adding we are 
going to abandon ship in 45 seconds 
boat and airplane crews found no sign of the vessel by daylight 
and the coast guard received no reports of missing boaters leading 
to speculation the call was a hoax especially considering the 
number of people supposedly on board said petty officer 2nd class 
bob morehead 
in a normal search and rescue operation like this we get 
several calls from family members and friends and other cocnerned 
people we havent gotten that in this case he said 
there is the possibility that this is a hoax but we are 
operating on the assumption that this is a legitimate call until 
we are confident we have searched the whole area with no sign of a 
boat and no report of anyone overdue 
the search was centered about 30 miles south of pensacola pass 
the entrace to floridas pensacola bay 
seas were 3 to 4 feet winds were 8 mph and the water was around 
70 degrees making overnight survival in the water possible said

recorded radar indicates the exact point where 
the engine of a dc10 jetliner failed over iowa farmland in july 
according to a national transporation safety board report 
a map released by the board tuesday shows the erratic looping 
flight path of the jetliner over iowa farmland before it 
crashlanded at sioux city airport on july 19 killing 111 of the 
295 people on board another passenger died 31 days later from 
injuries received in the crash 
the winding flight path which spirals tightly downward after a 
wide loop documents the difficulty pilots had in getting the dc10 
jetliner to the airport after losing hydraulic steering control 
over one point on the map small triangles indicate the spot 
where the airliners tailmounted engine disintegrated said 
spokesman ted lopatkiewicz he said investigators believe the radar 
hits indicate falling engine parts 
the map was released as a farmer harvesting corn near alta 
iowa found what investigators said may be a key missing engine 
part a rotor fan disk from a jet engine embedded in the ground 
general electric co the engines manufacturer had asked 
farmers to be alert for parts that turned up in their fields and 
offered cash rewards for their return 
the pilots who were using engine thrust to guide the plane 
indicated they could only turn right through most of the landing 
but the map shows they also managed a tight 180degree left turn 
towards the runway before a final 360degree right loop just 
before landing 
the board released nearly 300 pages of material on the crash 
including the radar data and reports on the efforts of flight 
attendants to secure passengers before the crash air traffic 
control operations and the performance of systems on the crippled 
aircraft 
the documents do not indicate the cause of the explosive engine 
failure that forced the planes crew to make an emergency landing 
but one investigative team concludes that forceful discharge of 
fan rotor parts severed or loosened hydraulic lines associated with 
all three hydraulic systems 
a report on flight recorder data says there is no indication of 
a problem with the planes tail engine before it failed 
the safety board is not expected to come to a conclusion about 
the probable cause of the crash until several more months of 
investigation by its staff rewards have been offered for missing 
engine parts including a large disk from the tailmounted engine 
the recorded radar data provided time position and altitude of 
the airliner which was on a flight from denver to chicago 
at one point radar lost the airliner but digital flight data 
from the planes flight data recorder confirmed a final loop just 
before the landing according to the report 
a report on survival factors said 76 people died of multiple 
blunt force impact injuries and 35 people died of smoke 
inhalation 
the report said 30 children were aboard the airliner earlier 
iowa state medical examiner dr thomas bennett said eight of the 
passengers who died were 11 years old or younger and all of those 
died of smoke inhalation

environmentalists and top state democrats 
have unveiled a ballot proposal to phase out cancercausing 
pesticides ban new oil drilling offshore set up a spill cleanup 
fund and protect californias ancient redwoods 
the sweeping environmental protection initiative proposed on 
tuesday would also create an elected statewide office of 
environmental advocate to enforce the law 
the proposal was outlined by gubernatorial candidate attorney 
general john van de kamp other democrats and several environmental 
groups 
sponsors have five months to gather the 372178 signatures 
needed to put it on the 1990 ballot analysts give the measure a 
strong chance of passing 
the point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a 
decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental 
action through programs for preserving a clean ocean clean food 
clean atmosphere and a clean government said assemblyman tom 
hayden 
advocates say it would protect food by phasing out 
cancercausing pesticides by 1996 and requiring improved chemicals 
by 1997 
the measure would protect the coast with tough standards for 
discharge of pollutants and require sewage plants to meet federal 
clean water standards by the year 2000 
a 500 million fund for prevention and cleanup of oil spills 
would be established and the initiative would allow drilling 
leases within the threemile state limit only in a national energy 
emergency 
it also would create a 300 million bond program for acquiring 
and protecting californias ancient redwoods 
the measure was drafted with help from such groups as the sierra 
club the california league of conservation voters and the natural 
resources defense council 
by supporting this initiative california voters will be 
making a personal commitment to the planet said lucy blake 
executive director of the conservation voters league 
she said the measure would restore the state to its rightful 
place at the forefront of the environmental protection movement

just as the abortion battle intensifies in the 
courts and statehouses some political observers and population 
experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic 
overtaken by technology 
they say the abortion pill in growing use in france 
inevitably will reach america legally or illegally and forever 
change the argument women who want abortions will have them 
without having to visit clinics possibly without doctors and 
maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant 
to antiabortion forces the french pill is a cloud on the 
horizon it comes as the supreme court faces another opportunity to 
overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as florida 
legislators meet in the nations first special session on abortion 
since the high court in july gave states additional power to 
regulate abortions 
people on either side of the argument are spending a lot of 
energy and emotion on a political issue thats going to be 
defused says leonard a cole who teaches in the science 
technology and society program at rutgers university in newark 
nj he has looked into the likely political consequences of an 
easytouse athome abortion pill 
werner fornos president of the population institute says 
ru486 the french pill will make the entire issue moot it will 
take the judgmental community out of play 
fornos says if the supreme court overturns roe vs wade and 
turns the abortion question back to the states thats likely to 
intensify the infiltration of ru486 
this would become the newest of illegal substances that would 
readily find themselves in the us marketplace he says 
the antiabortion communitys leaders acknowledge that the 
french pill will divert their energies to new fronts to keep the 
drug from being smuggled into america from being approved by the 
food and drug administration and from being manufactured by us 
pharmaceutical houses 
they already speak of boycotts of any drug house that seeks to 
conduct research on the abortion pill 
our position is very clear and i think the drug companies are 
very aware of it says richard d glasow education director of 
the national right to life committee the largest antiabortion 
group 
based on the evidence that we have before us we dont think 
its going to come into the united states either legally or 
illegally says glasow its against the law its dangerous 
for women to take and nobody is going to give it to women he 
says medical liability laws will make doctors refuse to oversee its 
use 
cole however draws a comparison with the birth control pill 
efforts were made to enforce laws to prevent the sale and use of 
birth control devices until the birth control pill came into 
widespread use he says and at that moment the battle against 
contraception effectively ended 
and he says a society that could not keep liquor out during 
prohibition and cannot keep tons of cocaine from crossing the 
border will not be able to prevent people from smuggling in a pill 
whose use is legal and considered safe and useful in france 
antiabortion leader gary bauer former domestic policy adviser 
to president ronald reagan says keeping ru486 illegal is crucial 
to the antiabortion movement even though certainly if it is 
illegal there will be people who use it 
the abortioninducing ru486 was developed by etienneemile 
baulieu one year after its introduction he says it has been given 
to 25000 women in france with a success rate of 96 percent in 
some instances a second pill must be taken and baulieu says 
medical supervision is called for 
nonetheless he said last week that the pill can give more 
privacy to the decision of pregnancy interruption 
ru486 is a synthetic chemical that when taken within the first 
seven weeks of pregnancy induces an abortion by causing the uterus 
to shed the egg 
its french manufacturer roussel uclaf citing antiabortion 
opposition and a threatened boycott withdrew it from the french 
market on oct 26 1988 but resumed distribution two days later 
under the direction of the french government whose health minister 
called the drug the moral property of women 
the french firm is not seeking to sell licenses to market the 
drug in the united states and no application for testing is before 
the food and drug administration 
but the national organization for women and the fund for the 
feminist majority predicted last summer that ru486 will come 
within this country in the next two to five years adding the 
question is whether it will come legally and therefore be 
administered safely under a doctors supervision or illegally 
with increased risk for women 
says wayne barden vice president of the population council 
what the antiabortion people are afraid of is that if it were on 
the market no one would ever know how many abortions there were 
often a woman wouldnt be aware that she was pregnant she would 
miss a menstrual period and take a pill and thats what takes the 
pill out of politics

president bushs chief of staff was urging the 
governors of seven states today to accept radioactive waste from 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in order to avert a possible 
shutdown of the plant next year officials said 
the facility near denver is the nations only source of 
plutonium triggers used in nuclear warheads colorado gov roy 
romer has said he will not allow the plant to continue operating if 
alternative sites are not found to store the waste by next march 
energy secretary james d watkins has said closure of rocky 
flats would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament since the 
triggers cannot be made elsewhere 
john sununu the white house chief of staff was telephoning the 
governors of colorado idaho nevada new mexico south carolina 
tennessee and washington today to ask for their help and to 
underscore the importance of keeping rocky flats open said phil 
keif an energy department spokesman 
hell tell them this is a critical thing we hope youll 
help keif said 
the seven states chosen as possible alternative sites for the 
rocky flats waste were selected because they already host energy 
department nuclear facilities keif said 
some of these states including washington nevada new mexico 
and idaho already have said publicly they would not agree to take 
any rocky flats waste even temporarily 
the waste is contaminated with plutonium which remains 
radioactive for 240000 years 
also today watkinss top aide on nuclear waste issues leo 
duffy was meeting with nevada gov bob miller in carson city to 
ask him to drop his alreadyannounced opposition to holding some of 
the rocky flats waste keif said 
duffy later was flying to idaho falls idaho to make a similar 
plea to gov cecil andrus idaho had been storing excess waste from 
rocky flats but on sept 1 andrus sealed his states borders to 
further shipments citing the energy departments failure to open a 
planned permanent waste dump in new mexico on time 
watkins told congress last week that the waste isolation pilot 
project or wipp near carlsbad nm would not be ready to open 
before next july 1 at the earliest 
watkins said about 250 cubic yards a month of rocky flats waste 
would have to be stored elsewhere after march in order to meet 
romers demands while wipp was unavailable he suggested then that 
he would ask seven states to share the burden of temporarily 
holding the waste while acknowledging that it would be difficult 
to persuade the governors

cambodians in thailands largest 
refugee camp threatened strikes and refused to unload un food 
supplies today after the international organization cut aid to the 
camp a relief official said 
aid workers said tuesday that the un cut some of its food 
rations to the sprawling site 2 camp because food and other 
supplies were being diverted to guerrillas fighting inside cambodia 
site 2 is controlled by khmer peoples national liberation 
front one of the three guerrilla groups fighting the 
vietnambacked government in phnom penh 
the cuts meant a decrease of about 20 percent of the total food 
aid to the camp which houses about 140000 cambodians they said 
but the cambodian administration of the camp had told refugees 
that the un had cut off all aid to the camp the relief official 
said today speaking on condition of anonymity 
workers in the refugee administration had refused to unload un 
food trucks and hospital staff had threatened to strike on 
thursday he said 
the guerrilla groups tactic appears to be to create 
antiunited nations sentimemnt among the population he said 
some refugees had become hostile to relief workers and some aid 
staff had been verbally abused he said 
although there are more than 100 outside relief workers in site 
2 much of the essential daytoday work is done by refugees 
the aid official said the united nations had insisted the 
refugees ensure that international food supplies are not sent to 
the guerrillas or sold on the open market it had also demanded an 
end to military operations carried out from site 2 he said 
relief officials have reported diversions of food medicine and 
other humanitarian aid since the international assistance program 
began a decade ago 
some officials privately have been especially critical of the 
aid being supplied to the communist khmer rouge guerrillas who 
exercise rigid control over the civilians under their control 
human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights 
abuses at the khmer rouge camps where monitoring of international 
aid is far more difficult than in camps of the other two guerrilla 
groups

court to waive jurisdiction on the bombing suspect this would move 
the states case into adult courts and mean the suspect could face

former president gerald ford once roundly 
ridiculed for declaring there is no soviet domination of eastern 
europe says he is taking particular pleasure in liberalization 
moves there especially in poland 
my mother taught me it is wrong to crow ford wrote in a 
column on the oped page of todays editions of the washington 
post but former presidents as well as small boys know no greater 
joy than being able to say i told you so 
ford recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaign 
debate with jimmy carter who went on to defeat him that there 
is no soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be 
under a ford administration 
i blew it ford wrote 
but he added reading the verbatim record with 2020 
hindsight in the light of recent developments in poland and 
throughout eastern europe i come out pretty well as a prophet 
thirteen years after he made the statement that angered many 
americans of eastern european descent ford said countries in the 
soviet orbit are writing themselves new constitutions based on 
fundamental human rights and freedoms 
the former president noted that boasting like lusting is 
best limited to ones heart 
so he added when my friends say you know what you said 
about poland not being dominated by the soviet union wasnt so 
stupid after all i give them a sphinxlike smile and accept their 
i guess compliments

antiapartheid activists met 
with president fw de klerk today to discuss the imminent release 
of eight political prisoners and ask him to make more concessions 
to the black majority 
de klerk met with anglican archbishop desmond tutu the rev 
allan boesak and the rev frank chikane the talks were the first 
de klerk has held with militant black leaders since he took power 
in august 
de klerks announced tuesday that the government would free 
eight longtime prisoners including seven leaders of the outlawed 
african national congress a prison official said the release would 
be within two weeks 
antiapartheid activists welcomed the announcement but called 
the move insufficent unless the government also frees african 
national congress leader nelson mandela legalizes banned 
organizations and lifts restrictions on many black leaders not in 
prison 
what is the use of releasing them when we still have a state 
of emergency and when our organizations are still banned the 
rev allan boesak asked 4000 people at a rally at the university 
of the western cape tuesday night 
eight is not enough with detainees and political prisoners 
including nelson mandela still being held hostage said boesak 
president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
the government has indicated mandela may be released within the 
next few months 
also today police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths 
from entering a sports stadium in the mixedrace township of 
athlone near cape town where about 3000 had gathered to 
celebrate mpethas expected release 
police forbade the crowd from marching out of the stadium and 
the youths sang freedom songs before dispersing quietly when they 
were told mpetha had not yet been freed 
state radio acknowledged in an editorial today that the 
prisoners have a constituency among south africas black majority 
and need to be part of negotiations 
where walter sisulu and others are recognized by some 
communities in south africa as their authentic leaders and if 
they too subscribe to democratic and peaceful objectives there 
is a need for them to be placed in a position where they can make a 
contribution to the debate on just how a future south africa should 
look radio south africa said 
sisulu is the countrys most respected black leader after 
mandela 
mandela told of the releases in advance was with a group of 
antiapartheid leaders at his home on the victor verster prison 
farm north of cape town when state television made the announcement 
mr mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight 
after all his efforts to secure their release said murphy 
morobe a spokesman for the banned united democratic front 
antiapartheid alliance 
he quoted the 71yearold mandela as saying to south africans 
the people are going to be greatly endowed by the leadership who 
are coming out of jail 
this unexpected turn of events will take the townships by 
storm and thousands will welcome them home the sowetan the 
nations largest black daily newspaper said today 
in blackpool england prime minister margaret thatcher welcomed 
the announcement of the releases calling it a major step in the 
right direction 
de klerk said the men would be freed as soon as the necessary 
formalities are handled a prison official said privately the 
process can take from an hour to two weeks 
de klerk took office in august and unlike his predecessors 
appears to be in earnest when he says he wants to allow eventual 
powersharing with the black majority 
sisulu ran daily operations of the anc as its secretarygeneral 
in 194954 when the government ordered him to resign he was 
sentenced to life in june 1964 along with mandela and other 
leaders of the ancs internal military wing for sabotage and 
plotting the overthrow of the goverment 
mandelas other codefendants to be freed are ahmed kathrada 
60 andrew mlangeni 63 elias motsoaledi 65 and raymond mhlaba 
69 
wilton mkwayi 66 who took command of the anc military wing 
spear of the nation after mandelas codefendants were arrested in 
july 1963 is to be released from a life term he received after a 
separate trial in 1964 
de klerks announcement also named oscar mpetha an 80yearold 
partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his 
fiveyear prison term in the hospital and was due for release next 
year 
mpetha the countrys oldest political prisoner was the anc 
leader in cape province and during the appeal of his terrorism 
sentence in 1983 was elected a copresident of the united 
democratic front

a syrian pilot landed his sovietmade 
mig23 fighter jet in northern israel today and the israeli army 
said he was a defector syria denied the pilot defected and said he 
was forced to land because of a mechanical problem 
this morning a syrian pilot escaped from syria with his plane 
a mig23 and he landed safely in israel said lt col raanan 
gissin an army spokesman 
the pilot landed at noon at an airfield at megiddo 57 miles 
north of jerusalem and was met by defense minister yitzhak rabin 
and the armys chief of staff lt gen dan shomron an army 
communique said israel radio said the man was being questioned 
in damscus a syrian official said the plane faced a 
technical failure and the pilot was compelled to make an emergency 
landing he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the official denied the pilot defected and said the government 
has begun contacts with the international red cross to secure the 
return of the aircraft and the pilot 
another syrian source also speaking on condition of anonymity 
said smoke was pouring out of the aircrafts only engine it was 
so bad that immediate landing was a must the pilot had no 
alternative but to land in the nearest spot he could find 
israeli witnesses to the landing said the plane did not appear 
to be in trouble when it touched down 
military sources said aircraft was escorted by israeli planes 
before it landed and that bases in the north were put on alert 
it would be the first defection by a syrian pilot to israel the 
neighboring countries have been in a state of war since israels 
founding in 1948 
the army identified the pilot as adel basem 34 and said he 
flew the aircraft across the frontier in the israeliannexed golan 
heights which israel captured from syria in the 1967 middle east 
war 
a witness told a reporter that the aircraft buzzed a row of 
houses moments before touching down at an emergency strip near an 
air base 
i was so surprised that i followed in my car to see what it 
was said a resident of the area who gave his name only as moshe 
israel radio said the plane carried no weapons 
the radio said the aircraft was an updated mig23 with very 
advanced electronics the mig23 was believed last updated in 1985 
gissin said there were two previous landings by syrian airmen in 
1973 both due to navigational error the men were later exchanged 
for israeli prisoners of war but their two mig17s were not 
returned 
the mig23 singleseat swingwing fighter bomber is considered 
one of the top soviet jets in use the aircraft has a range of 530 
miles and can carry up to 17000 pounds in bombs and missiles 
arab pilots have defected to israel twice in the past 
 
an iraqi pilot munir redfa landed in israel in a mig21 on 
aug 16 1966 in a mission blamed by iraq on the mossad israels 
secret intelligence agency the operation also angered the united 
states which was later allowed to examine the aircraft 
the first arab defector was an egyptian hilme mahmoud abbas 
who flew a sovietbuilt training plane into the country jan 19 
1964 
military officials promptly hailed todays landing as a boon to 
the countrys knowledge of enemy arab war capabilities 
i think in one sentence we can say that this is an important 
event for the air force without a doubt said reservist maj 
gen mordechai hod a former air force commander 
the significance is that the air force can now examine the 
plane secretly and test its electronics hod added in a radio 
interview 
other commanders noted that the mig23 had been used by syria 
during israels 1982 invasion of lebanon and that it was a mainstay 
of syrias air force regarded as one of the greatest military 
threats to the jewish state 
the syrians have since acquired a more sophisticated aircraft 
the mig29 which is the most advanced sovietmade fighter 
israel radio said the mig23 was first supplied to syria after 
the 1973 middle east war the fiercest confrontation between israel 
and syria

president bush today called in two key 
senators to mend fences in the aftermath of the failed coup in 
panama while administration officials tried to glean information 
from rebel leaders given refuge in miami 
bush summoned sen david boren dokla the chairman of the 
senate intelligence committee and sen william cohen rmaine the 
vice chairman following a week of congressional criticism about 
the way the administration handled the abortive uprising 
the president has the highest respect for the judgment and 
integrity of the two and wanted to take this occasion to 
reaffirm the close working relationship with sens boren and cohen 
and the senate select committee on intelligence a white house 
statement said 
also present at the 35minute meeting where bush thanked boren 
for his bipartisan leaderhsip on foreign policy were chief of 
staff john sununu national security adviser brent scowcroft and 
scowcrofts deputy robert gates 
scowcroft and boren had clashed during televised interviews 
sunday with the senator saying his committee had given bush 
everything he sought regarding panama and scowcroft disputing that 
statement 
backing away from scowcrofts stand a senior administration 
official said today that boren and scowcroft talked about the 
matter after the interviews and agreed they on the same track 
general scowcroft had no disagreement with senator borens 
statement said the official who declined to be identified 
the official said boren and cohen have been cooperative with the 
administration on panama and todays meeting was intended to 
cement the relationship and repair any damage 
meanwhile state department officials have been debriefing some 
of the members of the panamanian defense forces who had tried to 
topple gen manuel antonio noriega on oct 3 
among the 42 panamanians the united states flew to miami on 
saturday was capt javier licona believed to be the 
highestranking participant in the coup to escape capture said one 
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
family members of slain coup leader maj moises giroldi also 
were in the group state department spokesman rich sanders said 
tuesday he would not confirm whether the group included giroldis 
widow adela bonilla giroldi a key intermediary between us 
officials and the coup plotters 
these people definitely have good reason to be out of 
panama sanders said noriegas proven willingness to use force 
against people murder people is a matter of record giroldi was 
shot in the aftermath of the coup by some accounts at noriegas 
own hand 
in the wake of strong congressional criticism of bushs reaction 
to the coup attempt defense secretary dick cheney complained 
tuesday that interference by members of congress undermined the 
administrations ability to handle the crisis 
also an administration official said that bush unhappy over 
secondguessing about the way the united states handled the coup 
attempt ordered top officials last friday to put a halt to 
internal criticism a lot of it internal criticism was coming 
from people who didnt have the full picture said the official 
who declined to be identified 
state department representatives have been debriefing the coup 
participants who were given sanctuary in this country officials 
said 
officials in washington gave few details about plans for the 
panama defense forces members who were housed temporarily in a 
miami hotel 
they are coup members and their families white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said tuesday adding that revealing 
their identities could endanger them the group was received by the 
us catholic conference 
mark franken assistant director of refugee services for the 
us catholic conference in new york said his organization assured 
the panamanians their whereabouts would not be disclosed 
it is expected that arrangements will be made for those who want 
to settle in this country officials said 
the immigration and naturalization service was ready to review 
applications for political asylum from the group if such requests 
are made according to state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler 
in an interview with the associated press cheney complained 
that during the coup attempt we had situations here where 
members of congress were literally calling executive branch 
agencies downtown or even people in panama as these events 
unfolded demanding information that creates all kinds of 
problems 
cheney also said some members of congress made public comments 
based on inaccurate information such as the assertion that noriega 
was offered to us officials 
however fitzwater said we dont have any specific 
complaints about congressional interference in foreign affairs 
particularly in panama 
the pentagon said there had been dissension among the coup 
leaders about how to handle noriega when he was in custody of the 
coup participants on oct 3 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said an unnamed officer taking 
part in the coup insisted that noriega should be given to the 
united states and argued with giroldi who had no intention 
ever of taking that course

cheektocheek dancing has been declared out of 
step in the dance halls of shenzhen one of chinas most open 
cities and elsewhere in the country 
the shenzhen daily in a report seen in beijing on wednesday 
said close dancing using sexual enticements to attract customers 
and disturbing social order are violations of local entertainment 
regulations 
it said three dance halls were recently closed down and fined 
about 540 each for using lewd means to solicit customers 
the daily said the closures were part of a citywide inspection 
and reorganization of shenzhens 90 dance halls and teahouses 
the popular dance spots play a positive role in providing a 
fulfilling cultural life for the masses and contributing to the 
citys investment environment the daily said 
but some it said are troubled by poor management and others 
have been influenced by bourgeois liberalization the trend of 
favoring western liberal thought that is being attacked by the 
communist partys conservative leadership 
the dancing apparently is being banned elsewhere in the country 
but it is particularly being enforced in shenzhen 
shenzhen a special economic zone located near the capitalist 
enclave of hong kong is regarded as one of chinas most 
westernized cities and has apparently come under special attention 
in the governments campaign against bourgeois liberals 
the president of shenzhen university was dismissed for failing 
to oppose the prodemocracy student demonstrations in the spring 
it was not clear how long the ban on cheektocheek dancing had 
been in effect in shenzhen chinas strict arbiters of public 
morals generally frown on close dancing and other public displays 
of affection 
regulations recently seen outside a dance hall in canton 
another freewheeling city near shenzhen warned against unhealthy 
dance styles such as partners nestling close to one another

international fame has not changed monsieur 
ferre as the milanese creator is called since he became designated 
designer for the famed french house of dior 
he still cuts a modest bashful figure with his rotund body and 
bearded chubby face as he comes out on the runway for the standing 
ovation that greets his collection 
he seems embarrassed by the lipstick marks left by his models 
who vie to kiss him on the runway and inevitably takes out a 
handkerchief to wipe away his tears of emotion at another 
successful show 
yet this shy man always produces a dynamite collection his 
style is sexy selfconfident and unmistakable 
the ferre silhouette puts the accent on the upper body with 
broad shoulders and ornate neckline tapering into a small waist 
and narrow hips he favors seethrough fabrics tight contours and 
bold hemlines 
ferres springsummer 1990 collection presented tuesday night 
midway through the weeklong italian readytowear showings was no 
exception 
it was his first own label show since shocking the fashion world 
by accepting diors offer and the crowd was curious to see if he 
could successfully divide his loyalties between traditional rivals 
milan and paris 
what they found was a ferre better than ever light and airy on 
the one hand seductively masculine on the other 
thus bare midriff chiffon seethrough blouses are worn under 
slick mantailored suits with large rhinestone and gold buttons or 
a huge silk corsage of flowers and feathers and bejeweled cufflinks 
turns a mantailored shirt into a feminine item 
pants are cut straight for day and night and they are a dandys 
delight coupled with an oversized white blouse with a spill of 
panels down the front resembling a huge bouquet of napkins and a 
straw fedora 
as the day goes on ferres style becomes more elaborate 
culminating in a series of chiffon floral and paisley printed gowns 
richly decorated with gold and crystal sequins 
ferre is into heavy gold jewelry as are many of the designers 
in milan he adorns his models with enormous charm bracelets with 
seamotif charms large beaded necklaces and chain belts 
among ferre innovations were the shortskirted summer wicker 
work suits woven out of burlap to look like raffia and a body suit 
in bands of gray jersey and skin colored chiffon that looked like 
mummy wrappings 
another big name to show tuesday night was mariuccia mandelli 
the master mind behind the krizia label 
the krizia collection was young and carefree with an accent on 
the 1940s to the tune of in the mood krizia showed that by 
day she was in the mood for bright colors short easy shapes and 
lots of prim navy blue and white 
neat daytime navy blue suits and dresses with crisp white 
lapels alternated with tshirts adorned with the new krizia 
animal the giraffe these were worn over cheerleader shorts in 
tropical shades two new daytime ideas were jodhpur sweat pants 
and patchwork camouflage leather 
at night krizia indulges in her favorite fabric accordian 
pleated silk for beautiful shawled blouses and wafty 
pastelcolored short party dresses 
like many of her colleagues this week krizia has no trouble 
baring the flesh leaving wide open spaces in the midriff or down 
the back bras as lingerie seem to be out of fashion whereas they 
take on new life as outer wear appearing in leather and jersey by 
day and sequin and gold by night seethrough fabrics abound 
for more than an hour krizias models kept coming out down the 
long runway while reporters simply put down their notebooks 
rowdier photographers shouted basta enough

autopsies indicated four suspected 
illegal aliens found dead inside a flatcar trailer were killed by a 
pesticide used to fumigate its cargo of tortilla flour an official 
said today 
railroad workers found the men tuesday morning in the open 
trailer it had been plastered with warning signs on its doors 
indicating its cargo had been fumigated with phostoxin which is 
used to keep insects and rodents away from food 
travis county coroner dr robert bayardo reported signs of 
internal bleeding typical of pesticide poisoning said justice of 
the peace sylvia white 
he said one of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those 
coins were black indicating there was poison in there ms white 
said 
she said a full toxicology report would be completed later this 
week 
the flour producer said tuesday the victims had apparently 
broken into the trailer after it was fumigated sealed and loaded 
on a flatbed car 
the men believed to be aliens from mexico and central america 
had been sitting close to the ceiling of the trailer on boxes of 
flour piled four to five feet high and had cut a breathing hole the 
size of halfdollar in the ceiling authorities said 
the body of a fifth man was found near railroad tracks in 
sinton about 60 miles south of victoria 
we believe that he was a member of the party that was in this 
particular trailer he may have either crawled out or fell out but 
we dont know positively said victoria police capt jesse 
ramirez 
the captain speculated that the victims may have been asleep and 
that the fifth man woke up felt ill and got out 
authorities also are trying to determine how the men got into 
the trailer whether it was locked once they got in and how it was 
reopened 
the doors can only be opened from the outside so were 
thinking somebody opened the door saw them dead and ran off as 
quick as they could ramirez said 
he also said police talked to four illegal aliens tuesday night 
who were on a different section of the train during the stop at 
sinton the four got out of their compartment and walked around

the house ways and means committee today 
rejected a bill that could have resulted in quick refunds averaging 
223 apiece for customers of the nations utility companies 
the bill by rep robert matsui dcalif lost on a 2213 vote 
with 12 democrats and one republican supporting it 
at issue in the bill cowritten by rep byron dorgan dnd 
was about 19 billion that the power gas and telephone companies 
collected in advance from customers to pay corporate taxes to the 
federal government the money was collected in anticipation that 
the utilities would owe taxes at a 46 percent corporate rate 
however when congress enacted the 1986 tax overhaul it cut the 
top corporate rate to 34 percent matsui was able to win passage at 
that time of an amendment giving utilities as long as 30 years to 
refund the excess to consumers 
matsui says now that he made a mistake that he was misled by 
the utilities into believing that the excess would be used to buy 
new equipment many utilities he says are so rich with cash that 
they are buying such businesses as golf courses recording studios 
and a drug store chain 
never before in my 11 years in congress has an issue been as 
crystal clear as this one matsui said earlier this year when he 
introduced the heavily lobbied bill its a matter of right vs 
wrong good public policy vs bad special interests ethics vs 
greed 
his bill would have have given state utility commissions 
authority to order utilities to refund the excess over some period 
longer than three years 
there was little debate in the committee before the bill was 
rejected reps ronnie flippo dala and ed jenkins dga 
argued that forcing quick refunds would cost consumers two or three 
times the size of the refund several years down the road

the federal trade commission voted unanimously 
wednesday to give consumers who purchase items by telephone the 
same rights they would have had if they bought through the mail 
currently mail order merchandisers must notify consumers if 
they are unable to ship products and goods within the time stated 
in advertisments and catalogs 
if the delay is going to be 30 days or less the buyer has the 
option to cancel the order if the delay is going to be more than 
30 days the order is automatically canceled unless the consumer 
expressly agrees to the longer delay 
the ftc action wednesday extends the rule to the shipment of 
merchandise ordered by telephone 
the existing rule has been very popular said commissioner 
mary azcuenaga noting that just one of 34 preliminary comments 
received by the commission opposed the extension that was from the 
representative of unnamed direct marketers she said 
the proposed rule change would not apply to shipments ordered 
through use of other as yet undeveloped technology but would 
include all ordering methods involving direct or indirect use of 
the telephone said azcuenaga this would include fax machines 
and machines produced for the hearing impaired she said 
the commission will send a notice of the proposed rule to 
congress and publish notice in the federal register allowing 30 
days further comment before the rule can take effect said 
spokeswoman brenda mack

the release of a dissident publisher 
police and opposition leaders said the casualties included 14 
officers and 14 members of the opposition democratic progressive 
party a policeman and four other people were reported hospitalized 
with serious injuries 
protest leaders said they believed many demonstrators did not 
report their injuries and estimated total casualties at about 50 
it was one of the most violent encounters in taiwan since 
demonstrations were legalized two years ago 
demonstrations outside the tucheng jail in a taipei suburb began 
tuesday taiwans national day when 10000 people gathered to 
demand the immediate release of publisher hsu hsinliang 48 
chang chunhung leader of the opposition party said of 
wednesdays violence the police mercilessly launched the bloody 
attack on the peaceful crowd under instruction of the ruling 
nationalist party the demonstration would have ended peacefully if 
the police did not disperse us with force 
on a videotape shown at changs news conference police were 
seen firing water cannons and swinging clubs at protesters some of 
whom shouted peace peace chang said police also smashed a van 
earlier wednesday police arrested 15 protesters who allegedly 
attacked them then released all the detainees on bail among them 
was hsus wife lin chengchien who police said was hospitalized 
with serious bone fractures 
nationalist party spokesman james chu said the opposition should 
be held responsible for wednesdays violence because several 
protesters threw stones and attacked police 
they apparently ignored the laws and barely understand that 
most people want a peaceful society he said 
protesters wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow flowers 
rallied outside the jail tuesday and said they would sleep there 
until they were allowed to meet with hsu 
about 3000 protesters remained past midnight and the twohour 
battle began when police moved in at 3 am 
police contended the demonstration was illegal because protest 
leaders did not apply for permission they said the protesters were 
dispersed to avoid violence and restore the free movement of 
traffic 
hsu was jailed after his return last month from 10 years in the 
united states he made the last stage of trip on a fishing boat 
from mainland china 
the government accuses him of helping organize an 
antigovernment demonstration in 1979 kaohsiung port protest 
leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at demanding more 
political freedom 
the nationalists fled the chinese mainland when the communists 
won the civil war in 1949 and have governed taiwan since

museum homecoming 
thursday through sunday the museum 16 miles north of knoxville

homecoming organizer john rice irwin 
for 6 a head visitors can learn how to make lye soap corn 
shuck dolls and flowers hickory bark baskets braided rugs gourd 
items knives saws skillets glass brooms and more 
the demonstrations will be given by people who learned those 
skills as part of everyday life irwin said 
it is just amazing how rapidly the culture has changed so that 
younger folks dont have any idea what their grandparents did 
irwin said tuesday 
so many of the revivalists in the craft business are great 
people but as you would surmise its just not the same as doing 
it like you have since childhood 
the expected 35000 visitors also can sample freshly made apple 
butter sassafras tea parched corn molasses bread cream and 
butter 
music is a large part of the homecoming including performers

nationally recognized writers such as roots author alex haley 
who lives nearby 
the pioneer museum in the hills of eastern tennessee is a 
60acre collection of original pioneer buildings and paraphernalia 
its first homecoming consisted mostly of a few crafts people and 
some authors trying to sell books but word of the annual festivity 
spread by mouth and the event grew in attendance 
i dont have a right to stop it irwin said it would be 
like a preacher deciding to disband the church

nasa engineers today reached into 
atlantis cramped engine compartment in an effort to replace a 
faulty computer the size of a tv set that delayed thursdays 
shuttle launch by at least four days 
the delay came after a judge cleared the way for liftoff by 
rejecting environmentalists fears that the shuttles 
nuclearpowered gallileo space probe could scatter plutonium over 
florida in the event of a challengerlike accident 
nasa said the liftoff of atlantis and its jupiterbound galileo 
could be rescheduled as early as monday the space agency nasa 
wants to launch atlantis as soon as possible because jupiter will 
be in the proper position only until nov 21 any delay beyond that 
would push the flight off until mid1991 
the space agency also has two other shuttle launches planned 
this year and a long delay could affect that schedule 
the decision to hold up the mission came after the master 
controller in one of three main engines gave a false pressure 
signal on a fuel pump said launch director bob sieck subsequent 
tests did not duplicate the bad reading 
we have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem 
and that there is no chance it will reoccur in flight and put us in 
jeopardy said bob crippen director of the nasa team that gives 
final launch clearance 
the worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and 
have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no 
probability of that 
atlantis commander donald williams said he was disappointed by 
the postponement but agreed with the decision because safety is 
an overriding concern in spaceflight 
engineers today worked at disconnecting wires and tubing to 
reach the computer 
crippen said removal began tuesday night it required opening up 
the engine compartment to get at the computer which is the size of 
a 17inch portable television and controls all engine functions 
during liftoff 
its a crowded place to work crippen said but we have 
done it before and we have the procedures in place 
the countdown which began monday was halted at the 19hour 
mark it will be picked up at that point when the computer work is 
done the five astronauts flew back to houston this morning to 
await resumption of the countdown 
shuttle workers received the bad news not long after getting the 
news from us district judge oliver gasch in washington that they 
could proceed with launch preparations 
the antinuclear groups had sought to block the liftoff on 
grounds that plutonium particles would spread over florida if 
atlantis exploded the plutonium is in two nuclearpowered 
generators that provide electricity for the galileo 
the court concludes that nasa has complied with requirements 
of the national environmental protection act gasch said 
justice department attorneys representing the national 
aeronautics and space administration argued that galileos 15 
billion sixyear mission to jupiter carried very low risks they 
said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38 
generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions 
gaschs ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining 
order a ruling that cant be appealed the plaintiffs said they 
were going back to gasch today to seek a temporary injunction 
whose refusal can be appealed 
the antinuclear groups said that if they lost in court they 
would attempt to halt the launch by trying to infiltrate the 
kennedy space center and put people on the launch pad 
on our side were sad because the court didnt rule in our 
favor but on the other side we feel that weve succeeded in 
bringing the issue to the public that they are planning to put 
nuclear power in space said bruce gagnon coordinator of the 
florida coalition for peace and justice one of the groups that 
sued 
when the launch is attempted he said were going to go with 
our plan to put people on the launch pad 
reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough said 
gary wistrand deputy director of security 
weve installed various types of tactical intrusion devices 
he said hopefully if they try this tactic well be able to 
detect and apprehend them before they are successful in getting to 
the pad

east germanys communist ideology chief was quoted 
today as calling for a more democratic society but the official 
party newspaper said the country can solve its problems only by 
strengthening socialism 
the developments were the latest in a series of mixed signals 
the hardline government has been sending the rest of the world as 
it grapples with a growing movement for social change 
kurt hager one of the most influential figures in the communist 
party hierarchy called for greater participation of the people in 
solving the countrys problems more openness in society and reform 
of the statecontrolled press 
hager a member of the policymaking party politburo made the 
comments in an interview with the soviet weekly moscow news on 
saturday as street protests erupted in several cities during the 
visit of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
staterun radio ddr read the comments in a broadcast today 
our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear 
concept for the development of necessary changes hager said 
that will require above all the active involvement of the 
population in solving important problems and a new policy of public 
information 
referring to the exodus of mostly young people from the country 
hager said that all of the obstacles have to be cleared away that 
have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full 
potential 
hager also also called for the government to react to the 
needs and mood of the people 
the party daily neues deutschland today conceded the country has 
problems but at the same time said socialism must be strengthened 
to solve them 
the newspaper also renewed its accusations against west german 
chancellor helmut kohl accusing him of unveiled interference in 
east germanys internal affairs kohl has been extremely 
critical of the east german government in recent days 
if today we stand before new demands that require new 
solutions well manage that ourselves the newspaper said 
we can solve our own problems not through kohls recipes but 
through socialist means through the further strengthening of 
socialism every demand and recommendation that in reality aims at 
weakening or even doing away with socialism cannot bear fruit among 
us the newspaper wrote 
local communist party officials in at least three east german 
cities dresden leipzig and magdeburg have either started talks 
with prodemocracy activists or talks are planned according to 
west german news media reports 
but questions remain whether highranking leaders in east berlin 
are ready to move away from the strict adherence to communism that 
has helped sparked an exodus to west germany of tens of thousands 
of its skilled young citizens 
guenter krusche head of the church in east berlin told west 
german radio today there are indications a number of east german 
cities will soon legalize the main opposition group new forum 
according to west german radio 
on tuesday west german news media reports said local communist 
officials had met with opposition leaders in dresden and talks were 
expected soon in leipzig 
westdeutscher rundfunk radio in cologne said today that 
magdeburg party leaders have also said they are ready for a 
dialogue 
however erich honecker the countrys 77yearold communist 
leader has indicated he will crush dissent if it challenges 
stability 
over the weekend authorities used force to disperse 
demonstrators clubbing and arresting hundreds then officials in 
leipzig allowed a peaceful march by 70000 people monday night 
local communist officials met monday with opposition leaders in 
dresden and talks were said to be expected in leipzig the first 
signs of official willingness to discuss change 
christof ziemer the superintendent of dresdens lutheran 
church said the two sides discussed electoral reform ending 
travel restrictions and the release of people arrested during 
street demonstrations 
the nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people were east 
germanys most serious since soviet tanks helped put down a 
workers revolt in 1953 
prodemocracy activists said authorities freed at least 500 of 
the roughly 1000 people arrested during demonstrations in dresden 
over the past week 
widespread discontent is responsible for the exodus of tens of 
thousands of east germans to the west and sparked the weekend 
demonstrations which coincided with official celebrations of the 
countrys 40th anniversary 
hansjuergen sievers a lutheran church pastor in leipzig said 
tuesday in a west german radio interview that he believed the 
decision by the leipzig officials to work for dialogue was 
certainly not made alone without discussions with others 
east germans do not choose their leaders and they need 
government permission to travel abroad many complain of tyrannical 
communist officials who can make life miserable for people who 
challenge the system

oct 6 
the westerly ri sun on the coup attempt in panama 
the failure of the coup attempt in panama is a blow to every 
freedomloving person in the world as panamanians continue to live 
in fear 
it didnt have to work the way it did the united states 
government was there and ready to aid the rebels it knew about the 
planned coup two days in advance so for the pentagon and 
security agencies to watch invites investigation 
those who would have the united states troops swoop into panama 
city would do well to remember the rise of the successful 
popular movement to remove ferdinand marcos from power in the 
philippines in 1985 and 1986 
such a movement has yet to take place in panama 
if a popular movement to oust gen manuel antonio noreiga 
fails and brings violence on the heads of the panamanians then the 
lives of american military personnel should be risked but not 
before

the state columbia sc on gorbachevs ban of labor strikes 
alarmed that a series of labor walkouts some for economic 
some for ethnic and some for political reasons were damaging the 
economy and undercutting perestroika mikhail gorbachev asked the 
soviet legislature to ban strikes altogether for 15 months 
the supreme soviet broke out in debate one deputy even had the 
gall to call a ban unconstitutional in the old days when the 
leader spoke real debate did not follow not if those who would 
dissent cherished their place in the scheme of things 
this time the deputies got together and proposed a compromise 
that was less than gorbachev wanted but which he could accept 
under the compromise strikes will be forbidden selectively in 
certain key economic areas and government agencies were given 
permission to take over the railroads in the restive republics of 
azerbaijan and armenia to keep traffic moving 
while this hardly constituted a crushing legislative defeat for 
comrade no 1 it suggested that the concept of separation of 
powers is no longer a totally foreign one in the soviet union 
furthermore in the pregorbachev days soviet leaders didnt 
bother to seek legislative approval to stop strikes the normal 
procedure was to repress them ruthlessly

corpus christi texas callertimes on jim bakkers conviction 
the conviction of televangelist jim bakker on 24 counts of fraud 
and conspiracy was certainly a blow to him personally and to those 
who retain faith in the defrocked minister and the conviction 
plus the revelations which went into it have delivered a blow to 
television highvoltage ministries in general 
but none of this should reflect upon religion itself that would 
be the most tragic outcome of all what bakker was convicted of had 
to do not with religion but with the perversion of religion for 
personal gain 
if anything the affair could be a positive factor for 
traditional churches it issues a warning to the unwary against 
being taken in by a charismatic video preacher encouraging the 
support of local churches instead if any good comes of the bakker 
trial that could be it

centre daily times state college pa on airline deregulation 
democratic lawmakers have long been concerned about declining 
airline competition but their concerns were largely ignored by 
the reagan administration 
there are encouraging signs however that president bush and a 
growing number of republican lawmakers are finally noticing the 
evidence particularly of monopoly control at major hub airports 
and may support steps to increase competition 
airline deregulation was expected to encourage new airlines and 
more competition by getting rid of government red tape since the 
changes took effect in 1978 many new airlines were launched but 
most went out of businesss at the same time the reagan 
administration failed to increase airport capacity and more 
important approved a string of large airline mergers the results 
have been higher fares and fewer options for consumers 
department figures underscore the need for changes to break up 
near monopolies in 1988 eight airlines accounted for 90 
percent of domestic air traffic compared with 15 carriers in 1984 
and 11 in 1979 
republicans are weighing legislation that could force 
airlines to sell their computerized reservation systems cap the 
percentage of gates an airline may control at an airport and ban 
or restrict carriers longterm leases at airports 
in the long run of course increasing airport gates and 
expanding facilities are the best way to stimulate competition 
but since thats not likely to happen immediately or on a large 
enough scale the growing interest in congress and the 
administration in taking other steps is welcome

a farmer harvesting corn found the engine part 
believed to hold the key to a united airlines jet crash that killed 
112 people in july 
it will fill in the answers as far as what precipitated the 
engine failure said jerry clark an investigator for general 
electric co maker of the engine that disintegrated and severed 
the jumbo jets hydraulic controls 
janice sorenson said she was driving a combine tuesday when she 
struck what turned out to be most of the engine rotor fan disk a 
part so highly prized that ge had offered a 50000 reward for it 
workers today loaded the metal onto an airplane bound for a ge 
plant in cincinnati for inspection 
clark said ge will comb the fields over the weekend for the rest 
of the disk and its connecting hardware only four of 20 bolts that 
held it to the engine have been found he said 
but clark he said he was confident the large piece which 
represents about twothirds of the 300pound titanium disk would 
allow investigators to pinpoint the cause of the engine failure 
i felt a resistance against the combine so i backed up and i 
looked and i could see the fan blades protruding from the ground 
mrs sorenson said today 
mrs sorenson said she knew immediately what the piece was 
because ge had distributed pictures of it to farmers 
i was shocked and i was very happy for ge because they put a 
lot of time in it she said hopefully it will solve some of 
the problems theyve been looking for 
united flight 232 crashed july 19 about 50 miles away at sioux 
city a total of 184 people survived 
investigators have speculated that a separated fan disk caused 
the rear engine to disintegrate throwing shrapnel that severed the 
hydraulics and made the plane virtually impossible to control the 
crew managed to turn the jet around and reach sioux city 
there is no doubt about it this is an extremely important 
find national transportation safety board spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz in washington said through meticulous metallurgy 
we hope to determine if that was the point of failure in the fan 
section 
clark urged others to keep searching for other engine parts a 
lot of important parts are still missing and are out there 
somewhere he said were still looking for the other side of 
the separated piece 
of the 271000 in reward money offered more than half is still 
available clark said 
in another development tuesday the ntsb released a radar map 
showing what it says is the exact point where the engine of the 
dc10 failed during its flight over iowa farmland 
the flight path spirals tightly downward after a wide loop over 
one point on the map small triangles indicate where the tail 
engine disintegrated said lopatkiewicz he said investigators 
believe the marks indicate falling parts 
clark said the disk originally was 31 inches in diameter it was 
found about 10 miles north of here metal detection experts will be 
flown in this weekend to continue the search he said 
several engine parts were found in farmers fields on the day of 
the crash last week as farmers harvested crops several found 
pieces of the plane including an engine fan blade in a bean field 
five miles from here 
clark said mrs sorenson might receive more than 50000 because 
some of the blades for which the company is paying separate 
rewards were still attached said ge lawyer stephen gadd 
mrs sorenson said this morning she hadnt had time to think 
about the reward i guess thats kind of a minor part right now

the navys investigation of the uss iowa 
explosion was thorough complete and expeditious and did not 
malign the character of two sailors who were focuses of the 
inquiry the pentagons inspector general said in a report obtained 
today 
all logical investigative leads were covered including those 
that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the 
explosion inspector general june gibbs brown said in a report to 
navy secretary lawrence garrett iii 
ms brown said she has concluded that the naval investigative 
service investigation was thorough complete and expeditious 
she also said the nis did not malign the character of two 
sailors who had been in the gun turret that exploded by looking 
into rumors of homosexuality and a possible criminal connection to 
the blast 
the inspector generals report dated oct 6 was undertaken in 
the wake of allegations that the nis had mishandled the probe it 
was made available to the associated press by navy officials 
rear adm richard milligan who conducted the navys fourmonth 
study of the explosion said gunners mate clayton hartwig was the 
most likely person to have caused the explosion and that he 
apparently placed some type of detonator between gun powder bags 
hartwig and 46 other sailors were killed in the april 19 
explosion which occurred in the no 2 gun turret of the battleship 
as it conducted gunnery practice off puerto rico 
hartwigs family has accused the navy of using the sailor as a 
scapegoat and sought a congressional investigation into the navys 
report another sailor gunners mate kendall truitt has charged 
the navy with slurring his reputation 
ms brown noted that milligan brought the nis into the 
investigation 21 days after the blast occurred when allegations of 
possible criminal acts surfaced 
she said truitt was investigated because of a possible motive 
for homicide that surfaced after hartwigs sister wrote a letter 
to the iowas commander complaining that her late brother had made 
truitt the sole beneficiary of a life insurance policy 
several witnesses including members of hartwigs family 
raised the possibility of homosexuality on the part of hartwig 
the nis had no choice but to explore the issue as a potential 
motive in the incident to neglect that investigative lead would 
have been derelict ms brown wrote 
the nis report offered no opinion about the homosexuality 
issue she said while witness statements alluded to possible 
homosexuality the nis investigation did not confirm it and the 
report did not claim that either hartwig or truitt wereare 
homosexual the nis did not malign the character of hartwig or 
truitt 
homicide suicide and human error were all obvious theories 
that had to be explored ms brown added the homicide theory 
was shortlived truitt was never a definitive homicide suspect 
 
inspectors general in each federal department monitor their 
agencys performance and investigate allegations of wrongdoing

americans avidly followed news of hurricane 
hugo but paid scant attention to another widely reported story the 
personal troubles of rep barney frank according to a survey 
released wednesday 
in its news interest index for october times mirror reported 
that 60 percent of the public followed the hugo story very closely 
placing it third on the list of the most closely followed stories 
of the past three years 
only the explosion of the space shuttle challenger and the 
rescue of jessica mcclure from a well in texas have attracted 
greater public attention since the times mirror surveys began in 
1986 
eighty percent of those polled said they followed news of the 
challenger explosion in january 1986 very closely the story of 
the child rescue in october 1987 was followed very closely by 69 
percent 
by contrast with the attention paid to the hurricane coverage 
only 6 percent said they closely followed stories about frank a 
massachusetts democrat who has acknowledged patronizing a male 
prostitute and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver 
this puts the frank story in a tie for the least closely 
followed story of those surveyed the troubles of former japanese 
prime minister noboru takeshita who resigned in may because of an 
influencepeddling scandal were also attended to closely by only 6 
percent of americans polled 
the difference in public response to these two stories is in 
keeping with a pattern that has become clear from the monthly 
findings of the times mirror news interest index times mirror 
said in a news release public attentiveness to coverage of news 
events is high while public attentiveness to news about most 
personal scandals is usually low 
times mirror also said that its october findings dramatically 
reinforced previous indications that news from washington even 
when it has farreaching consequences often gets little attention 
no major washington story in the latest survey was followed 
closely by as many as 25 percent of americans 
even interest in overseas events such as the flight of east 
german refugees to west germany at 31 percent and the failed coup 
attempt in panama at 29 percent outdrew washington stories 
only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in congress to 
repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan although 
understandably this rose to 36 percent among persons over age 50 
president bushs education summit with governors was followed by 
15 percent and house approval of a cut in the capital gains tax by 
14 percent 
only 12 percent of the sample in the survey could identify frank 
without assistance and only 10 percent could identify samuel 
pierce former secretary of the scandalplagued department of 
housing and urban development 
by contrast 80 percent knew that actress zsa zsa gabor had been 
in the news because of her trial in beverly hills calif on 
charges of slapping a policeman 
times mirror said the survey results were based on telephone 
interviews with 1234 adults 18 or older conducted from oct 58 
it said the possible error attributable to sampling and other 
random effects was plus or minus 3 percent 
the study was conducted by the times mirror center for the 
people amp the press a division of the times mirror company which 
publishes the los angeles times newsday the baltimore sun the 
hartford courant and other newspapers and owns broadcast stations

beijing university freshmen will be taught how to 
shoot and throw hand grenades during special yearlong military 
training program that begins thursday an official newspaper said 
camp and field training marching in formation and basic 
military knowledge also are on the curriculum the guangming daily 
said wednesday it did not give details of the weapons training or 
say whether the students would use live ammunition 
xinhua news agency reported 143 other colleges and universities 
would conduct special eightweek military and political training 
courses variously sending all or some of the students to military 
camps or inviting officers to campus 
beijing university whose students helped lead the crushed 
prodemocracy movement in the spring announced that its freshmen 
class would spend a full year in military training at the army 
academy in shijiazhuang 190 miles south of beijing 
university president wu shuqing said saturday it was an 
experiment that had been planned well before the prodemocracy 
protests he said experience had shown that military training was 
beneficial to students 
most colleges already require one month of military training for 
freshmen but it is usually restricted to paradeground drills and 
basic military theory 
xinhua quoted an unidentified official of the state education 
commission as saying the commission drew up a plan in 1987 to send 
students at 10 key univerities including beijing university for a 
relatively long period of military training 
the plan failed because it was beyond the capacity of the 
army he said but it was going ahead for beijing university he 
said because the graduates of the prestigious beijing university 
should be fit for socialist construction and have a clear 
political orientation and sound morality 
he said the program was not punishment for the students role in 
the protests he said military training was popular among students 
parents and teachers because after the training the students 
become better disciplined and come to have a better understanding 
of the practical conditions of the country 
many more colleges wish to send students for such training he 
said 
the guangming daily said the beijing university class would 
divide its time evenly among military political and humanities 
classes it said the school planned an opening ceremony for the 
students thursday and had been preparing for their arrival by 
shipping in textbooks and freshly painting the dormitories 
cafeterias and desks 
the students will wear the same uniform as the academys 3400 
military cadets xinhua said it described the school as chinas 
best training ground for junior officers with uptodate 
teaching facilities 
beijing universitys freshman class numbers fewer than 800 this 
year down from the 2100 that had been planned before the protests 
and the june army crackdown the state education commission which 
decides enrollment also has cut the freshman classes of other 
universities nationwide apparently in an effort to better maintain 
control over the student body 
wu said beijing universitys student population had grown too 
large for its facilities but said next years freshman class 
probably would be closer to the size of previous years

as little as 1 cent but trinity repertory theaters experiment

expected on tuesday for a preview performance in the 550seat

the audience for the performance of maxim gorkys summerfolk 
ranged from students to elderly from the apartment up the 
street she said 
based on similar experiments in baltimore and san diego 
trinitys managing director e timothy langan said he expected 
people would pay 3 to 4 
fortier said most people paid 5 to 10 we got everything 
from a penny a ticket to 20 a ticket she said the only rule 
was that no one got in free 
the theater had yet to compile figures on revenue for the 
evening 
langan said the theater had set aside 5000 from a grant to 
cover the costs of the experiment 
fortier said the experiment likely would be repeated

two black officials criticized an 
association for honoring the late lb sullivan the citys police 
commissioner during the civil rights turmoil in the 60s and a 
participant in a historic libel lawsuit 
lb sullivan was a famous racist and hater of black people 
and anything they stood for said montgomery county commissioner 
frank bray after the alabama peace officers association announced 
that sullivan would be installed wednesday in its hall of fame 
i think it was very inappropriate said state rep alvin 
holmes he promoted segregation and racism in the city 
however a third black official montgomery city councilman 
joseph dickerson said he has no harsh feelings about the induction 
of sullivan who was montgomerys police commissioner from 
19591967 
the police commissioners actions during the 1960s were a sign 
of the times he said he was playing a role if he was the 
police commissioner today he would be playing a completely 
different role 
murfee gewin executive director of the peace officers 
association said the induction was based on sullivans overall 
contribution to law enforcement 
he was prominent in the field of advanced training of law 
enforcement officers and in increasing their abilities through 
continuing education gewin said this is a career award 
sullivan sued the new york times in 1960 after it ran an 
advertisement soliciting funds for the legal defense of the rev 
martin luther king jr the ad said montgomery police armed with 
guns and tear gas surrounded a black college after a student 
demonstration 
sullivan won the libel suit and a 500000 judgment when the 
case was tried in montgomery alabamas capital but the us 
supreme court eventually overturned the verdict on appeal 
establishing libel precedent in the process 
the court ruling in what became known in libel case history as 
sullivan vs the new york times asserted that public officials who 
sue for libel must show that the story even if false was 
published with malice with knowledge the story was false or with 
reckless disregard for whether it was true or false the 
courts decision also established a higher standard of evidence to 
prove malice 
sullivan who was state public safety director from 19511955 
also served as state prison commissioner in the early 1970s when 
alabamas overcrowded prisons came under federal court scrutiny he 
was on thenattorney general bill baxleys staff as executive 
assistant when he died in 1977 at age 56

trygve haavelmo a norwegian professor 
who dislikes awards for academics won the nobel memorial prize in 
economic science on wednesday for using statistics and probability 
to forecast how economies behave 
haavelmo had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the new 
science of econometrics with his probability theory the royal 
swedish academy of sciences said in announcing the award 
i am honored anyone would be but i had nothing to do with 
making this award i really have nothing to say said haavelmo 
77 in an interview 
the prize is quite irrelevant to the real issues im 
exhausted and i have nothing more to say he added 
haavelmo who still works part time at the university of oslo 
has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes colleagues said 
tore thornstad a coworker at the university described haavelmo 
as a shy reserved person who prefers research and teaching to 
being in the limelight 
in his 1941 doctoral dissertation for harvard university 
haavelmo pioneered the field of econometrics which introduced 
statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting 
the thesis was published in 1944 ten years later he published a 
book of his research on economic development theory 
the academy of sciences said in its citation that haavelmo was 
awarded the 469000 prize for his clarification of the 
probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of 
simultaneous economic structures 
assar lindbeck head of the academys prize committee and a 
personal friend of haavelmo called him the father of modern 
econometrics and a dominant figure in postwar economic theories 
as soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a 
longterm projection it is econometrics that charts the 
relationship between all quantitative economic analyses lindbeck 
told reporters 
haavelmo was the second norwegian to win the economics prize 
since it was introduced in 1969 by the bank of sweden and added to 
the five other nobel prizes ragnar frisch who once employed 
haavelmo as a a research assistant won the prize in its inaugural 
year 
haavelmo is a member of the american economic association and 
the american academy of arts and sciences 
he was born dec 13 1911 in the town of skedsmo a few miles 
east of oslo the son of a school administrator he graduated from 
the university of oslo in 1933 
he moved to the united states in 1939 at the outbreak of world 
war ii on a rockefeller grant and worked at the university of 
chicago and later in new york with the norwegian trade ministry 
haavelmos doctoral thesis won him immediate recognition a 
think tank of young economic scientists from several nationalities 
the cowles commission was created to pursue the ideas he raised 
and other theories 
haavelmo returned to norway in 1947 and became professor of 
economics at the university of oslo 
i see haavelmo as an original thinker but one who always kept 
his theories relevant to the real world said thorvald moe a 
senior official of the norwegian finance ministry 
according to his sisterinlaw mrs margit haavelmo he never 
married and his only brother died five years ago he is a very 
well liked man mrs haavelmo said in a telephone interview 
roedseth director of oslo universitys social economics 
institute said haavelmo usually comes in to work several times a 
week although he went on full pension 10 years ago

would you give a credit card to a teenager linda 
fingersh would 
we felt that it would be to his advantage to learn about 
credit now in a small controlled environment said mrs 
fingersh who helped her 13yearold son adam get a credit card 
from the young americans bank hes very very responsible and 
thats why we cosigned 
more than 300 teenagers have applied for credit cards since 
they were offered aug 3 said leanne cadman a loan officer at the 
bank ten have been approved so far but the bank noted that many 
applications are still being processed 
the banks premise is simple credit is a fact of life and 
every youngster needs to learn how to use it responsibly what 
were trying to do is to teach them make sure what youre 
buying is worth it cadman said 
the card has a 100 limit and is available to people who are at 
least 12 years old who have had a savings account with a minimum 
10 balance for at least six months applicants must have an adult 
cosigner the annual fee is 15 and the card carries an 188 
percent annual percentage rate 
deb breeling a spokeswoman at the bank said other banks offer 
credit cards in childrens names on their parents accounts but 
as far as just having it in the childs name i think ours is the 
only one 
adam fingersh said the card will help teenagers learn the 
proper use of credit 
at some point were going to have to learn about credit its 
better to learn with a 100 dollar limit said adam who plans to 
use his card mainly in his tshirt business adams designs 
consumeroriented groups such as the national center for 
financial education have criticized the banks program claiming 
it teaches buy now and pay later 
credit card abuse and the overspending that credit cards are 
leading to is a very serious problem in our society said loren 
dunton executive director of the san diegobased center the 
nonprofit organization has launched a drive to discourage credit 
cards for teenagers 
our campaign is to discourage other banks from following suit 
around the country he said you can teach firearms without 
giving kids a loaded gun you can teach credit card responsibility 
without giving young teens a credit card 
jeanne goody director of education for the nonprofit consumer 
credit counseling service in denver said i can see no reason in 
the world why a 12yearold should have a credit card i think 
it was a really bad idea 
mrs fingersh said her son has friends whose parents have gotten 
into financial trouble with credit cards she has seen teenagers 
out on their own at 18 go like crazy when they obtain their 
first credit card 
she does not want that to happen to adam 
two other banks that cater to children have no plans to add a 
credit card to their services 
thats a nightmare that i dont want to get into said 
sherrie avery liaison between first national bank of south miami 
and its twiglet bank at david fairchild elementary school 
twiglet which opened in november 1987 is a commercial bank 
operated by students it offers checking and savings accounts and 
has about 14000 in deposits and more than 400 accounts customers 
must be students at the school 
the first childrens bank inside the fao schwarz toy store 
is a division of the first new york bank for business it offers 
checking and savings accounts and a college certificate of deposit 
plan but has no plans to add a credit card said mary

handle their accounts said linda sanders bank president day 
in and day out they have earned the respect that weve given 
them

the house voted today to liberalize the 
restrictions it had placed on federally subsidized abortions for 
the poor since 1981 
lawmakers accepted a more permissive senate provision by voice 
vote thus setting up a confrontation with president bush who has 
promised to veto legislation relaxing the conditions for 
medicaidfinanced abortions 
the senate provision would have medicaid pay for abortions when 
the mothers life is in jeopardy or when the pregnancy resulted 
from rape or incest 
the house on a 216206 vote first rejected its own 
restrictions that allow a medicaidfinanced abortion only when a 
womans life is threatened by her pregnancy 
the liberalized abortion language also prevailed on a second 
tally by a vote of 212207 
the abortion provision was part of a 1567 billion measure to 
finance labor health and education programs for fiscal 1990 which 
began oct 1 
in august bush threatened to veto the entire spending bill if 
it contains the more liberal abortion language administration 
officials reiterated that threat this week

on the fringes of this weeks annual 
convention of prime minister margaret thatchers conservative 
party the race to succeed her has begun 
in a party she has dominated for 14 years and which prides 
itself on loyalty to the leader in good times and bad the language 
is coded and the jockeying discreet 
after 10 years as prime minister mrs thatcher remains firmly 
in control of her party and intent on several more years in office 
she is greeted with undimmed enthusiasm as she arrives daily in the 
convention center to sit attentively through hours of debates and 
speeches by her cabinet ministers 
by tradition a prolonged standing ovation is guaranteed when 
she winds up the convention on friday her 64th birthday with her 
keynote address 
but mrs thatchers public opinion poll ratings are at an 
eightyear low the pound is sliding interest rates are soaring 
and headlines warn of economic crisis 
thus speculation about the succession is inevitable and outside 
the winter gardens conference hall in this north england seaside 
resort two of the top hopefuls exdefense secretary michael 
heseltine and deputy prime minister sir geoffrey howe are playing 
to packed houses 
howe said wednesday that conservatives must show that we are 
good not just at winning battles but at winning arguments and 
winning friends 
we must choose the style to match the mood of britain 
making sure that people recognize us as a listening party just as 
much as a crusading one howe added at a crowded fringe meeting 
decoded howes statement was a clear criticism of mrs 
thatchers combative style and the image she projects of lacking 
compassion toward the havenots in the entrepreneurial britain she 
has tried to create 
howe 62 whose mildmannered style is the antithesis of mrs 
thatchers was removed as foreign secretary last summer in what 
was widely seen as a demotion 
heseltine 56 a temperamental politician who stalked out of the 
thatcher cabinet in 1986 during a dispute over the takeover of an 
ailing helicoptermaker westland topped two public opinion polls 
last week as the favorite to succeed mrs thatcher 
howe was also among the top six potential successors along with 
former party chief norman tebbit transport secretary cecil 
parkinson and exeducation secretary kenneth baker now party 
chairman 
at a standingroom only fringe meeting in a victorian theater 
heseltine hinted that the thatcher government presiding over a 
record trade deficit was letting britain slip back into the old 
ills of highwage lowproductivity industry 
truth does not change simply because it is 10 years old 
thundered the tall selfmade millionaire britain is not paying 
its way 
heseltine a rankandfile lawmaker has been doing what all 
ambitious politicians do while waiting in the wings going for the 
grass roots by campaigning tirelessly up and down the country 
he never criticizes mrs thatcher herself and when asked about 
his leadership aspirations his stock response is that hell do 
whatever the party asks 
the leader of the conservative party is chosen by its members of 
parliament and if the party has a parliamentary majority the 
leader automatically becomes prime minister 
mrs thatcher has won three successive elections and it is 
generally assumed she will lead the party into the next election 
which must be held by mid1992 
but the tories are trailing the opposition labor party by an 
average of seven points in a string of recent opinion polls labor 
has been consistently ahead for the past four months 
now to take the shine of the tory convention interest rates 
are at 15 percent double the rate of june 1988 inflation which 
mrs thatcher vowed to eradicate is at 73 percent and the pound 
has suddenly weakened 
the downturn could be just a phase as mrs thatchers 
supporters insist but if it is worse than that and she looks like 
losing the next election she might have to make way for a 
candidate with better prospects 
commented londons liberal guardian newspaper if and when 
there actually is a vote for the leadership of the conservative 
party to succeed mrs thatcher it may be judged that the race 
began in blackpool

texas at 21 percent and new york with 10 percent 
florida has 8 percent of the nations hispanics and there are

a dispute over church pension funds invested 
in companies operating in south africa is dividing members of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america as its pension board 
prepares to meet this week 
a resolution ordering the board to divest all south african 
holdings by sept 1 1991 was approved in august at the 
denominations first churchwide meeting since the 1987 merger of 
the lutheran church in america the american lutheran church and 
the association of evangelical lutheran churches 
at least one congregation advent lutheran church in the st 
paul suburb of roseville has authorized a lawsuit to prevent the 
pension board from divesting says its pastor thomas basich 
nobody is for apartheid i think its awful said basich 
the issue here is whether or not political considerations should 
enter into investment decisions without approval of the 26000 
people who are members of the pension fund and beneficiaries of the 
pension fund 
the rev joseph w ellwanger of cross lutheran church in 
milwaukee counters the bottom line must not be financial return 
but what is morally right 
the other point is that investments in nonsouth african 
companies have indeed yielded as much as and in many cases more 
than companies involved in south africa said ellwanger acting 
treasurer of pension members for justice a grassroots lutheran 
organization advocating divestiture to pressure south africa to end 
its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid 
at stake is the denominations 16 billion pension fund of 
which 849 million is invested in companies that do business in 
south africa 
some members of the independently incorporated pension board 
based in minneapolis also oppose the resolution board president 
john kapanke has said the board at its monthly meeting here 
thursday through saturday will consider seeking a court judgment 
on whether the board can totally divest within the bounds of its 
fiduciary responsibility 
it is our opinion that the timeline as proposed puts the board 
in an almost impossible situation if it is to divest within a 
prudent policy kapanke said during the august convention 
it is unclear how many of the 21member pension board oppose 
divestment or whether they have the authority to defy the 
assembly kapanke said 
they are going to try to weigh the directive of the churchwide 
assembly with the fiduciary responsibility of the members he 
said 
if the board fails to meet the 1991 deadline kapanke said 
church members could institute a procedure to remove members 
several protestant denominations notably the episcopal church 
the united church of christ the church of the brethren and the 
quakers already have strong divestment policies at varying stages 
of implementation said donna katzin she is director of south 
africa programs for the interfaith center on corporate 
responsibility in new york an ecumenical coalition of the lutheran 
body 
however the lutheran pension board believes its the first us 
religious denomination to set a specific date for divestment she 
said 
ellwanger said the pension board knew the resolution was 
imminent because the new denominations constituting convention in 
1987 passed a similar resolution 
im not sure that any deadline would be satisfactory to john 
kapanke and people against divestment ellwanger said 
basich said he doesnt believe divestiture is an ethical way to 
end apartheid i dont think its right for people who live 
10000 miles away to wreck another countrys economy whos going 
to gain by that 
he said members already have the option of putting their pension 
money in south africa free funds but that only 13 percent of 
pension fund contributions have been so earmarked 
kapanke said investments in nonsouth african companies have 
performed well through august 31 the social purposes equity 
fund nonsouth african investments was up about 28 percent he 
said 
an estimated 85 percent of the conventions 1041 delegates 
voted for the divestment deadline but kapanke said delegates 
didnt fully understand the issue and called for a vote on the 
matter by pension plan members

the legislature today killed 10 more 
antiabortion bills favored by gov bob martinez and sped toward 
early adjournment without disturbing floridas abortion law 
a right having been established is not easily removed 
said house speaker tom gustafson a democrat 
four bills in the republican governors package were killed on 
tuesday the first day of a special session he convened to take 
advantage of a us supreme court ruling in july opening the door 
to more restrictive abortion laws 
today the senate health care committee voted 52 to kill a 
proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortions to cases of 
rape or incest or when the mothers health is in danger or the 
fetus deformed 
later the panel defeated three proposals to tighten clinic 
regulations and a house subcommittee rejected six bills that 
mirrored the senate measures 
i dont think its a moment for rejoicing martinez said 
after the first defeat of the day if anything its a moment of 
sadness 
the proceedings were the nations first special session on 
abortion since the us supreme court upheld a restrictive missouri 
abortion law 
gustafson and senate president bob crawford also a democrat 
said they expected both houses to adjourn by late afternoon the 
special session was to have lasted through friday 
i think the legislature was reflecting the will of the 
people said crawford 
only a handful of spectators attended todays proceedings and 
virtually none of the estimated 10000 demonstraters in town monday 
and tuesday were visible today at the capitol 
in recent weeks the firstterm governor has focused on the 
issue of regulating clinics more closely three south florida 
clinics have been closed by the state in the last two weeks after 
inspectors found unhealthy conditions 
on tuesday about 1000 abortionrights activists celebrated 
outside the capitol 
the real news story is that nothing is going to happen here 
kate michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league told a cheering crowd martinez is suffering a 
very embarrassing defeat 
florida lawmakers convened in the afternoon amid tight security 
after more than 10000 prochoice and antiabortion demonstrators 
held rallies police guarded the doors to the democraticcontrolled 
senate and house chambers 
the abortionrights side sang america the beautiful and 
hired an airplane to trail a banner reading keep abortion 
legal antiabortionist activists wore tshirts with the words 
spoken as a former fetus im glad im here 
police made two arrests a 14yearold was charged with a 
misdemeanor for wearing a derogatory message on his jacket that 
referred to the governor and a 49yearold abortionrights 
supporter was jailed on charges of striking a man in the face with 
a video camera 
martinezs proposals that were defeated by the senate health and 
rehabilitative services committee included a ban on use of public 
financing and public hospitals for abortions and a requirement for 
viability tests on the fetuses of women who are at least 20 weeks 
pregnant 
those bills were defeated 93 as was a proposal that would have 
required women to wait a week and undergo counseling before having 
an abortion 
the committee said a bill to establish a state adoption center 
to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion was a good idea 
but defeated it 84 lawmakers said it should be taken up again 
when the legislature considers child abuse reform next month 
the committee action tuesday was a blow to the unborn said 
ken conner president of the florida right to life 
elsewhere a legislative committee tuesday in springfield ill 
heard prochoice advocates decry proposed curbs on lateterm 
abortions but the panel chairman said the bill probably would go 
to the house without major changes 
in harrisburg pa a lawmaker introduced a bill to eliminate a 
law requiring rape and incest victims to report the crimes before 
they can get publicly funded abortions a house committee set a 
hearing on a series of abortionrelated bills for friday

an official commentary thursday condemned 
reformist efforts to reduce the role of communist party ideologues 
in government and factory management saying this would turn the 
party into a mere afterhours club 
the commentary in the beijing daily blamed ousted party general 
secretary zhao ziyang for the notion that the party should stick to 
running itself it was one of the harshest attacks on the purged 
leader in weeks 
after several months of steady media condemnation the latest 
official comments on zhao had taken a softer tone and credited him 
with contributions to chinas economic reform 
the hardline commentary not only signaled that differences 
still exist in the leadership over how to treat zhao but put in 
doubt the future of political reforms 
in the past year the leadership has slowly stalled or reversed 
on key elements of its economic reform program which sought to 
reduce rigid central planning 
political reforms were never given as much priority and were 
much less ambitious but a basic goal was the separation of party 
and government functions to allow government to become more 
professional with a stronger legal base 
both political and economic reformists had advocated reducing 
the partys role in enterprises every enterprise has a party 
branch 
the manager responsibility system which allowed factory 
managers to make business decisions on their own as long as they 
could earn profits was adopted widely over the past decade and 
praised for boosting production 
but the beijing daily which has carried many of the medias 
most hardline articles since the june crackdown on prodemocracy 
protests condemned any efforts to divorce the party from the 
daytoday running of the government and factories 
reform of political structures and separating the government 
and party doesnt mean the two are getting divorced it said 
it is intended to solidify the partys position in power and 
improve and strengthen its leadership 
it accused zhao of weakening the partys base in factories its 
major source of strength by emphasizing the role of the 
factory director 
he put the enterprises party organizations in an auxiliary 
subordinate role it said 
if the enterprises party organizations are divorced from the 
important activities of production and business how can they 
guarantee and supervise the implementation of party and government 
policies 
if the party concentrates just on running itself the paper 
said it cant be a political party it can only be an 
afterhours mass organization or a club 
it added ominously as party general secretary how could 
comrade zhao ziyang not know the partys nature and role his 
purpose in putting forward the idea that the party only run itself 
is very clear because of his erroneous stance the partys 
work organization and fulltime working staff have been slashed 
peoples thoughts are in chaos and party building and party work 
have suffered great damage 
the 69yearold zhao was party chief for less than two years 
when he was ousted in june after losing a power struggle triggered 
by handle massive studentled demonstrations for a freer society 
he has not been seen in public since may but party and 
government officials say he is living comfortably at his home in 
party headquarters in zhongnanhai in central beijing 
at a news conference in september his successor jiang zemin 
said zhao had made contributions as party secretary and 
previously as premier although jiang did not say what zhaos fate 
would be his mild tone was taken as an indication that he was not 
likely to be put on trial for his alleged mistakes 
when he was ousted the party said he had supported the protests 
and split the party

abortion is bound to wither away in america as 
a political issue some observers say just as soon as the french 
abortion pill crosses the atlantic either legally or illegally 
people on either side of the argument are spending a lot of 
energy and emotion on a political issue thats going to be 
defused says leonard a cole who teaches in the science 
technology and society program at rutgers university in newark nj 
even if the french pill doesnt win the right to be marketed in 
the united states it is bound to be smuggled in and come into 
widespread use adds cole who has looked into the likely political 
consequences of an athome abortion pill 
wayne barden vice president of the population council says 
that with the new drug abortion will become a private decision in 
which even the woman taking the pill may not know whether a 
pregnancy had occured that is what the antiabortion people are 
afraid of he says 
and werner fornos president of the population institute says 
the french pill will make the entire issue moot it will take the 
judgmental community out of play 
ru486 the abortion pill has been given to 25000 french women 
with a success rate of 96 percent in the year it has been 
available according to its developer 
the national right to life committee predicts it can keep the 
abortion pill from being made or sold in this country through a 
boycott of pharmaceutical companies if nothing else 
it is going to be very difficult to find predicts richard 
glasow education director of the committee 
he sees ru486 as a dangerous drug which is being sold in 
france because the socialist government in france is 
ideologically committed to it 
but in the united states he says public opinion will be 
against taking such a dangerous drug 
glasow concedes the antiabortion movement can do little to keep 
pills from being smuggled into the country 
there is going to be a certain number of people who disobey 
the law glasow says 
certainly if it is illegal there will still be people who 
use it adds gary bauer former domestic policy adviser to 
president reagan 
the national organization for women and the fund for the 
feminist majority predict ru486 will come into use in this country 
within five years and say the only remaining question is whether 
it will come legally and therefore be administered safely under a 
doctors supervision or illegally with increased risk for women 
cole sees an analogy to the effort in the 1950s to block the 
sale of birth control devices the instant the birth control pill 
came into widespread use he says the battle against contraception 
effectively ended 
eventually somebody is going to see the profit potential of 
ru486 as large enough to overcome the worries and the political 
opposition that any pill producer is bound to face he says 
a society that cannot keep tons of cocaine from finding a market 
cannot keep an abortion pill out he adds 
etienneemile bauliueu developer of ru486 predicted earlier 
this month that americans will find ways to have the pill 
distributed here 
baulieu said the pill should be taken under medical supervision 
he said it can give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy 
interruption 
ru486 is a synthetic chemical that when taken within the first 
seven weeks of pregnancy induces an abortion by causing the uterus 
to shed the egg often it must be used with a second compound 
requiring two visits to a doctor 
its french manufacturer roussel uclaf is not seeking to sell 
licenses to market the drug in the united states and no application 
for testing is before the food and drug administration

a group of militant israelis is preparing to 
lay a threeton cornerstone next week in hopes of eventually 
rebuilding the ancient jewish temple angering arabs and some 
fellow jews 
this is the answer to the intefadeh palestinian uprising and 
the answer to those who are trying to destroy us gershon 
salomon chairman of the temple mount faithful movement said 
wednesday 
the group wants to rebuild the temple that was destroyed by the 
romans in 70 ad an earlier temple built by king solomon was 
destroyed by the babylonians in 587 bc 
such a plan is provocative because the 35acre site where the 
ancient temples stood includes the spot where moslems believe the 
prophet mohammed ascended to heaven 
the platforms two mosques the dome of the rock and al aqsa 
are the holiest islamic places of worship after mecca and medina in 
saudi arabia 
the temple mount faithful initially planned to lay the 
cornerstone on the platform but police denied them permission 
salomon said instead the cornerstone will be placed in the 
meantime near the ramp leading to the moghrabi gate of the mount 
he said 
the ceremony is scheduled for monday 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori confirmed the temple 
mount faithful has permission for a ceremony near the gate 
if it causes a disturbance or damage we will of course stop 
them sandori said 
adnan husseini director general of the moslem trust that 
administers the mosques said he did not know what moslem reaction 
would be 
they know well that the moslems know how to take care of their 
mosques husseini said the police and god will save the 
mosques because they are for people praying 
rabbi richard g hirsch executive director of the world union 
for progressive judaism the international office for reform 
judaism criticized salomon and his movement 
i consider their version of judaism to be a perversion of 
judaism and their acts to be a retrogressive negative force he 
told the associated press 
he added we consider any attempt at this time to inject an 
issue such as a reconstruction of a temple in jerusalem to be a 
negative divisive deleterious force 
a spokesman for conservative jews said salomon and his group 
were motivated by politics not religion 
he is attempting to make a political provocation and we are 
very opposed to this said rabbi ehud bandel director of the 
conservative movements education and outreach department 
salomon said he did not care what the arab reaction would be 
i dont want to hear an answer from the arabs he said we 
think that the arab period in israel and on the temple mount has 
come to an end

a ussoviet pact reducing strategic nuclear 
arms is unlikely before president bushs summit next year with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev a leading house republican 
said wednesday 
rep william s broomfield of michigan ranking gop member on 
the house foreign affairs committee said unresolved issues will 
delay a superpower agreement 
broomfield recently met with arms control negotiators during a 
congressional delegations trip to geneva he based his comments on 
statements made by the soviets negotiators including the chief 
negotiator yuriy nazarkin 
the soviet negotiators view the likelihood of a start treaty 
as very doubtful prior to the summit scheduled for late spring or 
early summer next year broomfield said in an interview 
the lawmaker said a number of troubling problems still have 
to be worked out he declined to provide specifics 
however broomfield said he is optimistic that a ussoviet 
agreement will be reached to slash the superpowers store of 
longrange nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent 
eventually he said it wont be a rushed job for 
signing at the summit 
shortly after meetings last month in wyoming between secretary 
of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze bush indicated that a strategic arms control treaty 
was possible 
yes i do the president said in response to questions on 
the chance of a treaty i think the setting of a summit will 
perhaps serve as a catalyst for moving forward 
but its not a given its not absolutely certain that thats 
going to happen but i would agree that we have a good likelihood 
that might happen bush said

cracks are appearing in the once solid 
antireform communist governments of east germany and 
czechoslovakia although theres been no real progress toward 
democracy senior state department officials said wednesday 
the officials pointed to recent moves by the mayors and other 
authorities in leipzig and dresden east germany to open a 
dialogue with prodemocracy demonstrators as an indication 
resistance may be growing to the communist governments antireform 
stance 
there seems to be some indication of a split richard 
schifter assistant secretary of state for human rights told the 
house foreign affairs committee 
it could be that some people see the handwriting is on the 
wall and prefer to go with change rather than sticking with the old 
men who rule east germany schifter said 
curtis kamman deputy assistant secretary of state for european 
affairs agreed that the mayors action could be significant 
i hope that that continues and that it represents movement 
he said 
kamman said that while the role of the communist party remains 
paramount in east germany czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria 
the ferment of the democratic reform movement in poland and hungary 
cannot fail to have an impact 
already splits are occuring in the formerly solid antireform 
regime front in east germany and czechoslovakia although both 
still have a long way to go kamman said 
kamman said he believes change is so far advanced in poland and 
hungary where a genuine rebirth of politics is under way that 
it is difficult to see how it could be reversed 
it is very hard to go in another direction unless you bring 
repressive force to bear and i dont think anyone in those 
countries wants to do that kamman said 
rep steny hoyer dmd cochairman of the watchdog commission 
on security and cooperation in europe told the panel that despite 
official resistance and oppression the thousands of east germans 
marching to the american civil rights song we shall overcome 
bring hope that independent activity will broaden and become a 
powerful force for reform

a human rights activist who has 
gone underground failed to appear in the brno regional court 
wednesday to appeal his sentence witnesses said 
stanislav devaty was sentenced to 20 months in prison on aug 29 
on charges of inciting hostile moods in the population after he 
was involved in production of printed material and organized 
petitions in its support the state news agency ctk said 
devaty 37 was released from custody after the sentencing 
pending an appeal of his conviction and he apparently went 
underground after that 
activist jana petrova brought a letter from devaty to the brno 
court in which he said he would remain underground until the 
charges were annulled emigre sources in vienna said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
after the sentence was pronounced devaty said none of us 
doubts that this trial should be considered a political trial 
vaclav havel the banned playwright and unofficial leader of 
czechoslovak opposition called devatys decision to go underground 
an experiment and a very respectable decision in continuity 
with his attitude speaking to reporters outside the courtroom 
wednesday 
devaty was initially detained march 16 as part of a mass 
crackdown on dissent that included the jailing of havel and other 
leading activists 
devaty was tried in connection with a petition signed by more 
than 400 people calling for more religious an cultural freedom and 
the release of all political prisoners 
havel meanwhile said he had not known in advance about the 
publication of his picture and a birthday greeting in the communist 
party daily newspaper rude pravo 
a picture of havel appeared in the paper saturday with an 
accompanying birthday greeting to ferdinand vanek a name havel 
used in some of his plays 
the message said havels friends and colleagues thank him for 
the hard work he has done and is still doing in his life send many 
greetings and wish him a lot of success in his work havel turned 
53 on oct 5 
havels picture has not appeared in the official czechoslovak 
press since the 1968 sovietled invasion that quashed the prague 
spring liberalization reforms of alexander dubcek it was printed 
in the personal columns apparently unwittingly by the papers 
editors 
i consider it a good prank but i certainly did not do it 
havel said about the publication of the picture under the 
pseudonym it is not my habit to congratulate myself 
it was done by a group of admirers unknown to me but i thank 
them it made me very happy havel told the associated press in a 
telephone interview

with jane pauleys 39th birthday looming and her 
13th year on today noted the only question wednesday was 
whether shed stay on the toprated troubled morning show neither 
she nor nbc would say 
all nbc news would say in response to a published report that 
pauley probably would leave the show at years end was that pauley 
who has two years left on her contract would stay at the network 
as jane pauley has stated she will be staying on with nbc 
news nbc said in a statement conversations about specifics 
are concluding now and we expect to announce our mutual plans 
shortly 
pauley who didnt return phone calls on the 13th anniversary of 
her joining the show reportedly has been upset over changes at 
today including a switch of news anchors in which nbc news 
at sunrise anchor deborah norville last month was made the 
today news anchor 
that job had been held by john palmer a former white house 
correspondent since 1982 he now anchors the earlier sunrise 
there has been speculation about which nbc wont comment that 
norville is being considered as the next today coanchor she 
was given a fiveyear contract in august 
peggy hubble an nbc news spokeswoman declined to say wednesday 
when or if pauley will be leaving today which she coanchors 
with bryant gumbel 
were discussing her role with nbc news hubble said as for 
today and pauley she said i think its premature to make 
any specific announcement she said she didnt know when one 
would be made 
nbc news president michael gartner nbc sports president dick 
ebersol who oversees today and pauleys agent ralph mann 
did not return calls secretaries said the three executives were 
out 
pauley who turns 39 on oct 31 succeeded barbara walters the 
first female coanchor of today in 1976 
at that time walters left to join abc after 15 years on 
today on which she started as a writer she now coanchors 
2020 for abc news and celebrityinterview specials for abc 
entertainment 
both pauley and norville 31 came to nbc news after anchor work 
at nbcowned wmaqtv in chicago norville joined nbc in january 
1987 
gumbel started wednesdays today broadcast by noting that 
pauley began on the show 13 years ago that day thats a long

democrat douglas wilder is on the offensive in 
the virginia governors race with a groundbreaking television 
commercial on abortion that challenges a decade of political wisdom 
marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and 
give it to the politicians says the announcer while the screen 
shows pictures of the american flag and a statue of thomas 
jefferson he wants to go back to outlawing abortion even in 
cases of rape and incest 
wilders ad attacked by coleman as an attempt to spread 
fear is crafted to appeal to conservatives as well as liberals 
by framing the abortion issue as one of personal liberty and 
freedom of choice 
his decision to focus on abortion challenges recent trends in 
which the issue has played a major role in defeating several 
democratic candidates and in an offyear campaign season wilders 
approach is being watched closely especially in the wake of a 
supreme court ruling that permits states to put greater 
restrictions on abortions 
each side in the bitter abortion debate claims it is gaining 
strength after the court decision with prochoice groups saying 
their supporters will be energized by the threat of greater 
restrictions 
the issue is being played out in other campaigns as well 
new jerseys gop gubernatorial candidate james courter has 
softened his antiabortion position in new york republican 
mayoral candidate rudolph giuliani has moderated his views as 
well to the point where roman catholic cardinal john oconnor has 
publicly criticized unnamed candidates who engage in what i 
consider political evasion 
the florida legislature called into special session by 
republican gov bob martinez to consider stricter limits on 
abortion swiftly killed a series of antiabortion measures and 
headed for adjournment wednesday without approval of any of the 
governors proposals 
if anything its a moment of sadness martinez said 
a right having been established is not easily removed 
said house speaker tom gustafson a democrat 
but the most dramatic test is unfolding in virginia where 
wilder is trying to become the first black ever elected to govern a 
state 
ultimately this will hurt wilder says david osteen 
executive director of the national right to life committee said 
there are more people against abortion than for abortion 
but frank greer wilders washington campaign consultant who 
made the commercial says otherwise 
there are those who would say dont go out an a limb on the 
abortion issue because its a liberal issue said greer i 
think its a very conservative issue 
coleman won a tough republican primary emphasizing his 
opposition to abortion in nearly all cases excepting only those 
where a mothers life is endangered by pregnancy and after winning 
the nomination coleman said he would not press an earlier pledge 
to try to outlaw abortions arising from rape and incest and in most 
other cases saying there was no chance the legislature would pass 
such a law 
wilder has said he supports keeping virginias abortion laws 
which generally impose few restrictions although he has said he 
might sign a law requiring parental consent for abortions on minors 
the virginia race has mobilized national interest groups the 
national abortion rights action league an abortion rights group 
has run fullpage newspaper ads and is beginning its own 
independent television ad campaign attacking coleman 
the national right to life committee is at work in virginia but 
is staying out of the new jersey race said executive director 
osteen he said his group is airing television ads around 
virginia except in the affluent northern virginia suburbs of 
washington 
wilders commercial is directed at the states conservative 
resistance to government intrusion in personal affairs in what 
greer says is an effort to tap the same vein as a campaign against 
guncontrol laws might 
in virginia we have a strong tradition of freedom and 
individual liberty rights that are now in danger in the race for 
governor the announcer says in the ad doug wilder believes 
that government shouldnt interfere in your right to choose he 
wants to keep the politicians out of your personal life dont let 
marshall coleman take us back 
independent public opinion polls have shown a trend in wilders 
direction in the three weeks since he began airing the commercial 
his campaign has spent more than 500000 airing the ad so far and 
he plans another on the subject 
meanwhile coleman has begun to fight back 
in a statewide televised debate monday coleman made an issue of 
wilders ad and charged the democrat was trying to to spread fear 
fear from a single divisive issue 
wilders campaign and national democratic observers say their 
polling in virginia shows 60 percent support for maintaining 
abortion rights and that that figure has grown by 10 percentage 
points since wilder began airing his ad 
a decade ago abortion was used as an issue against several 
incumbent democratic senators who were denied reelection with the 
emergence of ronald reagan in 1980 as the republican presidential 
nominee the gop platform took its strongest stand ever against 
abortion 
but the abortion debate has taken on a new political intensity 
across the country since the supreme courts ruling in a case last 
july 
in that missouri case the court stopped short of reversing its 
1973 decision upholding abortion rights but gave the states leeway 
in imposing regulations on most abortions

soviet tv viewers wednesday night got a chance to 
see the aliens that created a cosmic sensation with their reported 
landing in the town of voronezh but only in a childs scribbled 
drawing 
the soviet nightly news program vremya broadcast a report 
from voronezh showing the spot among yellowleaved birches where 
according to the official news agency tass scientists confirmed an 
unearthly craft had touched down 
the picture by a child who claimed to have witnessed the 
landing showed a glowing twolegged sphere with a smiling stick 
figure inside 
tass made a worldwide splash monday with its straightfaced 
report on towering pinheaded aliens who emerged from a spaceship 
that landed in a park in voronezh 300 miles southeast of moscow 
since then scientists have disparaged the report and attributed it 
to rising sensationalism in the soviet press under glasnost or 
greater openness 
the vremya report although more skeptical in tone than that 
by tass offered without comment an interview with schoolboy vasya 
surin a purported witness to the close encounter 
we were scared said vasya who appeared to be about 11 
it hovered over this tree then the door opened and a tall person 
of about three meters three yards looked out he didnt have a 
head or shoulders either he just had a kind of hump there he had 
three eyes two on each side and one in the middle 
vasya said the alien had two holes instead of a real nose and 
could not turn his head so he had to swivel his middle eye 
an aviation engineer from a nearby factory said he and his 
colleagues measured the landing area and found an intense magnetic 
field there 
but the vremya report concluded with some of the many 
factors that detract from the credibility of the sighting 
no adult witnesses could be found even though a large 
apartment house overlooked the site 
the story spread only a week after the supposed event when an 
article appeared in the local newspaper 
supposed alien minerals turned out to be of the earthly type 
only one thing is clear concluded soviet tv reporter l 
maximov its early to tell whats needed is research and not 
by voronezh enthusiasts but by experts

two inmates planted false clues hinting 
that they had escaped from the worlds largest walled prison and 
then hid inside the facility for a week while authorities conducted 
a threestate 100000 manhunt 
the two men concealed themselves in a fourfoot hollowedout 
stack of boxes and apparently planned to scale the walls of the 
state prison of southern michigan at jackson when the search died 
down said department of corrections spokeswoman gail light 
however detective sgt jerry boyer said wednesday no one is 
redfaced about falling for the ploy by david bellah 42 and 
steven mikko 27 who were found tuesday after officials were 
tipped to their hiding place 
im not embarrassed in the least bit we had information to 
believe these guys were outside and we followed up on it he 
said if you have a crow pie that you want me to eat id be 
glad to 
boyer estimated state police spent more than 100000 searching 
for the inmates within michigan the search extended to indiana and 
nevada where bellah and mikko had friends and relatives 
the two discovered missing on oct 4 during a routine count 
were thought to have walked out disguised as guards boyer said 
because negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false 
badges and a note said they had bought guard uniforms for 250 
mikko also arranged for a cousin who lived in the area to call a 
probation officer to say she had been asked to pick up the two on 
the day of the reported escape in rives junction about 10 miles 
north of jackson boyer said 
it certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had 
escaped from prison said boyer adding that the size of the 
57acre institution made it difficult to search it thoroughly 
light said prison officials were suspicious and received several 
tips that the two were still inside the prison 
the evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some 
doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were 
trying to distract us she said light declined to reveal the 
source of tuesdays tip that paid off 
we searched the prison every single day and continuously since 
they left we never stopped looking for these guys said marcia 
bailey administrative assistant to the warden at jackson 
bellah was convicted of killing a lansing police officer during 
a 1977 bank robbery mikko is serving 2540 years on an armed 
robbery conviction in montcalm county 
the two went undetected in a hollowed out fourfoot stack of 
boxes in a furniture factory on the prison grounds even though the 
area had been searched with tracking dogs bailey said 
light said a spring mechanism allowed the men to tighten the 
metal strap on the outside of the stack to make it appear the stack 
of boxes was solid 
the pair had a homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope made 
from nylon laundry bags they apparently intended to scale the 
28foot prison wall she said 
the two had a supply of apples candy bars and water and 
officials speculated that other inmates brought them food light 
said 
bailey said the men were armed with crude knives but offered no 
resistance when found 
they are being held in administrative segregation and bailey 
said they will face misconduct hearings they could be placed in a 
higher custody level and have time outside their cells restricted 
before the escape the men were listed as close custody 
prisoners a level below maximum security and could leave their 
cells during the day for work and recreation 
jackson county prosecuting attorney joseph filip said no 
criminal charges will be filed the potential two to fiveyear 
sentences would have less impact than prison disciplinary steps he 
said noting bellah already is serving a mandatory life sentence 
authorities said mikko had attempted escapes at least twice 
before

nasa on wednesday tentatively 
rescheduled the launch of atlantis for tuesday as technicians began 
the laborious job of replacing the faulty engine computer that 
scrubbed the flight 
there is a 5050 chance of completing the necesary work in 
time for a tuesday launch a statement said it said shuttle 
managers would meet at noon saturday to decide whether to aim for 
that date or to try for wednesday 
a launch tuesday five days later than the original launch date 
would take place during a 24minute period beginning at 1257 pm 
the launch date for atlantis and five astronauts with a 
nuclearpowered planetary package will depend on how work 
progresses in swapping and checking the master control computer in 
main engine no 2 
technicans opened atlantis cramped engine compartment wednesday 
and set up work platforms so they could gain access to the bad 
computer it is to be removed and a new one installed friday 
its a crowded place to work and its not easy said bob 
crippen head of a mission management team which set the new launch 
date officials had said earlier that monday was the earliest 
possible date 
the delay was announced tuesday night just 90 minutes after a 
federal judge rejected a request by three antinuclear groups to 
halt the flight the groups claimed the shuttles jupiterbound 
galileo payload could scatter its radioactive plutonium fuel over 
florida if there were an accident during launch 
nasa wants to launch atlantis and get galileo on its way as soon 
as possible because jupiter will be in the proper position only 
until nov 21 any delay beyond that would put the space probes 
flight off until mid1991 
atlantis commander donald williams said wednesday he was 
disappointed the launch was postponed but said he agreed with the 
decision because safety is an overriding concern 
he spoke to reporters before he and his four crew members flew 
back to their training base in houston to rehearse in a shuttle 
simulator they plan to return here two days before the new launch 
day 
we understand what happened and why and we concur 
wholeheartedly and sincerely in the decision williams said in 
manned space flight we obviously take a great deal of effort to 
make everything failsafe we should never ever deviate from 
that 
at launch pad 39b technicians were working on a schedule aimed 
at completing computer removal replacement and checkout by late 
saturday 
once the task is completed nasa could resume the countdown 
which was halted at the 19hour mark more than 15 hours of hold 
time is built into the count in case of contingencies so the 
countdown time remaining is about 34 hours 
the computer which weighs 230 pounds and is about the size of a 
17inch portable television controls all functions on one of the 
shuttles three main engines during liftoff 
it became necessary to remove the device called a master 
controller when engineers were unable to determine why it had 
given a false fuel pump pressure reading 
shuttle workers received the bad news not long after us 
district judge oliver gasch ruled in washington that they could 
proceed with launch preparations 
the court concludes that nasa has complied with requirements 
of the national environmental protection act gasch said 
justice department attorneys representing the national 
aeronautics and space administration argued that galileos 15 
billion sixyear mission to jupiter carried very low risks they 
said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38 
generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions 
gaschs ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining 
order a ruling that cant be appealed the plaintiffs said they 
were going back to gasch to seek a preliminary injunction whose 
refusal can be appealed 
the antinuclear groups said that if they lost in court they 
would try to halt the launch by infiltrating kennedy space center 
on launch day

attorney general dick thornburghs trips cost 
the government more than twice as much as those taken by his 
predecessor during a nearly comparable period the justice 
department said wednesday 
thornburghs 47 trips aboard government aircraft between oct 7 
1988 and sept 4 cost 154618 compared with 74247 attorney 
general edwin meese spent during his last 10 months in office 
according to records furnished by spokesman david runkel 
runkel attributed much of the increased expense to three flights 
aboard us marshals service airplanes that cost 80171 
the only difference is when you include the incredible charges 
of the marshals service he said 
travel records show that a marshals service twinengine jet flew 
from oklahoma city to pittsburgh on may 16 to pick up thornburgh at 
940 am and fly him back to washington at a cost of 5260 
the night before thornburgh had flown from washington to 
pittsburgh aboard an fbi turboprop plane that trip cost 730 
according to fbi records 
while in pittsburgh thornburgh voted in the pennsylvania 
primary spoke to fbi agents at the local field office and was 
interviewed by radio station kdka 
a letter the marshals services public affairs chief stephen t 
boyle wrote last week to two news organizations detailing the 
expenses said the plane for the pittsburghtowashington flight was 
requested may 12 
boyle said he didnt know why thornburgh requested the plane 
thornburghs tab at the marshals service also includes 46792 
for an aug 69 trip to mexico city for a meeting with mexican 
officials and to honolulu where the attorney general addressed the 
american bar association convention according to boyles letter 
written in response to queries by the new york times and los 
angeles times 
runkel made boyles letter and a similar response by fbi 
spokesman milt ahlerich available to reporters 
thornburgh and five aides flew aboard a marshals service boeing 
727 airliner from san francisco to honolulu because the plane used 
during the earlier legs of the trip was unable to fly nonstop from 
the west coast to hawaii runkel said 
the boeing 727 normally used to transport prisoners was 
pressed into service because another plane that thornburgh 
originally planned to use for the entire trip had broken down 
before he left washington runkel said 
a june 1214 trip to texas aboard a twinengine marshals service 
jet that flew from oklahoma city to washington to pick up 
thornburgh and several aides cost 28118 the airplane was 
requested two weeks in advance according to boyles letter 
the expense of the attorney generals travels also included what 
it cost for aides to accompany him on the trips runkel said 
runkel said he didnt understand why the marshals service 
billing system makes flights on its planes significantly more 
expensive than those aboard fbi aircraft 
boyle said the justice departments management division went 
over the bills in some detail before they reimbursed us to 
determine if they were indeed valid and justifiable and apparently 
felt they were because they paid the bill for all three flights 
the marshals service includes the cost of fuel boyle said 
the figures for meeses travels covered the period from oct 1 
1987 until he left office aug 8 1988 runkel said 62000 of the 
74247 was for trips aboard fbi aircraft meese flew on commercial 
airlines for the other trips

federal investigators have asked the san 
antonio housing authority to account for 47 million in 
questionable spending and repay 84260 used to finance such items 
as rotary club memberships and banquets 
in a review dated oct 3 by the inspector generals office at 
the department of housing and urban development investigators said 
there were possible violations of law or conflicts of interest in 
several areas including procurement and contracting practices and 
the use of nonprofit corporations 
the report said the agency may have spent 38 million alone on 
questionable contracts including goods and services obtained 
without competitive bidding 
the agency may have also overpaid one of its nonprofit 
corporations at least 255344 for windows screens and doors the 
review said the remainder of the questioned spending included such 
items as unsupported payment vouchers and 129000 in paid sick 
leave 
apolonio flores the housing agencys executive director 
disputed each of the 14 separate allegations he defended the use 
of lowincome housing funds for a rotary membership the 
soliciation of 1800 in donations from contractors and businesses 
for a hispanic chamber of commerce mixer and said the nonprofit 
corporations saved the agency 3 million 
theres nothing were not prepared to defend flores said 
he accused hud investigators of not examining his agencys records 
or talking with his staff although there were seven or eight or 
them in san antonio for about three months 
the report said two of the agencys nonprofit corporations 
realized receipts over expenses mostly through transactions 
between the corporations and federally funded housing programs for 
the poor but did not pass those savings on to lowincome projects 
as a result the housing authority may not have operated its 
housing projects in the manner prescribed by texas state law and a 
conflict of interest may have occured the review said 
as of jan 31 the san antonio housing assistance corp had a 
balance of 285922 while the san antonio housing facilities corp 
had a balance of 12 million and investments totaling nearly 48 
million 
under texas law the report said there does not appear to be 
any provision for the san antonio housing authority to maintain 
such a fund balance 
accordingly the sahac might be required to use any excess of 
reciepts over expenses soley to make decent safe and sanitary 
housing available for persons of low income the review said 
the report also said the housing authority through the san 
antonio housing facilities corp purchased a private housing 
project for 113 million that rents to nonlow income individuals 
and families under texas law however a housing authority may 
rent or lease housing only to people of low income 
of the 84260 that the inspector general has recommended the 
agency be required to repay 73857 was charged to federal 
programs for such items as banquets computer hardware and office 
furniture for the lowincome housing projects rotary club 
membership fees and tax handbooks and publications 
another 1800 was improperly solicited from businesses and 
contractors to pay for the chamber mixer in october 1988 the 
report said 
the investigators made their recommendations for action to the 
hud regional administrator in fort worth the authority has 60 days 
to respond to the review while the administrator has six months to 
decide how to proceed

flores the island of flowers a catholic stronghold in a sea 
of islam 
the pope flew in a c130 military transport after changing 
planes in dili giving him a preview of his stop thursday in east 
timor indonesian authorities had erected a billboard at the 
airport with a picture of the pontiff and president suharto that 
says welcome pope john paul ii to timor indonesias 27th 
province 
indonesian forces invaded the former portuguese territory in 
late 1975 and annexed it the following year 
the dusty island of flores prepared for days for the papal 
visit being overwhelmingly catholic in the worlds most populous 
moslem country the vatican estimates nearly 85 percent of flores 
663000 residents are catholics 
roman catholics number about 5 million in indonesia compared to 
the 157 million moslems 
lying offshore was an indonesian warship part of security 
precautions for the popes overnight stop church officials 
expected about 250000 people at a papal mass in a soccer stadium 
the pope told them catholics can play an important role in 
indonesia 
you understand the enormity of the task facing your country in 
providing better education and training more jobs and just wages 
and a more equitable distribution of the advantages of economic and 
cultural development he said 
your christian faith urges you to be involved in this great 
undertaking 
the pope flew 940 miles eastward from jakarta to reach this 
island that was first settled by portuguese and dutch explorers 
meanwhile news reports in lisbon portugal said wednesday that 
nationalist rebels fighting indonesian rule in east timor called a 
5hour ceasefire in their 14yearold guerrilla struggle while

the vatican does not recognize the annexation of east timor and 
has continued to keep the bishop of timor under its direct control 
he is not a member of indonesias conference of bishops 
john pauls decision to visit the territory touched off 
controversy fretilin officials said the trip implies a tacit 
recognition of the occupation

us rep robert garcia and his wife used the 
wedtech corp like a personal bank trading the congressmans 
political influence for payoffs and interestfree loans a 
prosecutor charged wednesday 
the garcias were greedy they wanted something more from this 
office than the satisfaction of doing good for the public said 
assistant us attorney michele hirshman in closing arguments at 
the garcias bribery and extortion trial 
in doing so they corrupted it abused it misused it sold 
it she said 
the defense painted a different picture in its summation 
telling the 12 jurors in manhattan federal court to acquit the 
garcias by rejecting testimony from the prosecutions star witness 
former wedtech vice chairman mario moreno 
there are many reasons to doubt morenos testimony reasons 
based on lies told and untold crimes and his willingness to do 
anything to evade justice said ronald fischetti the lawyer for 
jane lee garcia 
fischetti said moreno who pleaded guilty to theft and 
briberelated charges in 1987 and testified at other wedtech 
trials was a perjurer liar and thief 
garcia a 56yearold bronx democrat and his wife are accused 
of conspiring to obtain 185000 in checks and interestfree loans 
and a diamond and emerald necklace for mrs garcia from officials 
of the nowdefunct wedtech corp 
their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at 
wedtech the small south bronx machine shop that grew into a 
multimilliondollar defense contractor through various bribe 
schemes the company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of 
corruption 
hirshman said the relationship between garcia and wedtech 
started out legitimately with the congressman using his influence 
to help wedtech secure government contracts 
this changed she said when financial problems prompted the 
garcias to seek money from wedtech the prosecutor said their 
dealings turned into extortion in may 1984 when the congressman 
told moreno that his power in the house was growing and then asked 
him to hire his wife 
when moreno balked saying it would be improper mrs garcia 
suggested the payments be made through a lawyer friend in puerto 
rico ralph vallone hirshman said 
the prosecution claims that in 1984 through 1986 wedtech sent 
vallone 86100 of which 76000 was transferred to mrs garcias 
consulting firm 
fischetti said he did not dispute that mrs garcia received 
money from vallone but he claims the payments were for work 
unrelated to wedtech 
fischetti said the prosecution had presented no evidence to 
support morenos testimony about the alleged extortion and bribery 
there is no corroboration of illegal acts 
after the vallone payments began hirshman said garcia helped 
wedtech obtain a lucrative contract with the us postal service 
something he should have done without getting paid 
she said their financial problems continued in 1985 so the 
garcias returned to their local cash machine the wedtech corp 
for a 20000 loan 
garcia instructed moreno to make the check out to his sister 
aimee cortese and she transferred the money to mrs garcias 
account hirshman said 
if this was a legitimate loan why is mario moreno being told 
to make the check out to aimee cortese she asked 
closing arguments will continue through thursday when us 
district judge leonard sand will instruct the jury deliberations 
are expected to begin friday 
the garcias have pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy 
extortion bribery and accepting illegal gratuities if convicted 
of the most serious charge extortion they would face up to 20 
years in prison

president mikhail s gorbachev does not object to 
communist parties changing their names and programs as hungarys 
has done the polish party chief said wednesday after conferring 
with the soviet leader 
gorbachev stressed that the shape and organization of any 
party depends only on that party mieczyslaw f rakowski told a 
news conference after their 3hour talk 
the hungarian party which had been losing members and falling 
in polls voted saturday to dissolve itself and form a 
westernstyle socialist organization 
rakowski said that example probably would be followed by the 
polish party which lost its hold on the government in august to a 
coalition led by the oncebanned solidarity trade union 
i think our party also must change its program and its name 
and i think this will happen at the next party congress rakowski 
said he added that polls show such a change is favored by 70 
percent of the members of the polish united workers party as the 
communists formally call themselves 
even the soviet communist party could be transformed but the 
changes might not mirror those occurring in eastern europe he said 
such changes are possible but will depend on internal 
forces in the soviet union rakowski declared 
of the soviet leaders attitude toward poland which plans 
westernstyle economic reforms he said gorbachev approved of 
the policy of our prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki that policy 
is aimed at putting an end to the critical situation in our 
country i am going home satisfied 
on wednesday evening state television broadcast part of a news 
conference in which gorbachev told polish journalists after ups 
and downs in the history of our relations we are on the right 
track rapprochement and cooperation between our peoples 
the climate of reform has caused problems for more doctrinaire 
countries in the soviet bloc 
tens of thousands of of east germans fled to the west through 
hungary to escape the strict regime and hardships in their homeland 
milos jakes head of the czechoslovak communist party expressed 
concern wednesday that recognition of opposition groups in hungary 
and poland would lend legitimacy to banned organizations that 
demand change in his country 
he told the party central committee in prague we are not 
indifferent to what points the way toward destruction of the 
socialist system in the friendly countries we clearly watch these 
things and draw lessons from them 
rakowski repeatedly praised gorbachev a reformer who is both 
president of the soviet union and head of its communist party 
he is a brilliant counterpart who perfectly understands the 
fragility of our world he said this has never been the case 
before 
by contrast he said of karl marx and vladimir i lenin we 
should not kneel before the teachings of lenin and his activities 
i am opposed to the religious attitude toward the teachings of marx 
and lenin 
when asked about the likely new goals of a transformed polish 
party however rakowski included a central tenet of communism 
even distribution of benefits 
he said poland would stay in the warsaw pact which he described 
as a necessary alliance but implied the poles might become neutral 
eventually 
i will not forecast what will happen five or 10 years from 
now he said the coming generation might think differently 
unfortunately i cannot influence their choice

president bush and nato secretary general 
manfred woerner reaffirmed wednesday a commitment to reaching an 
agreement with the warsaw pact within a year on reducing 
conventional forces in europe 
woerner speaking with reporters after conferring at the white 
house with bush said i think there is reason for optimism 
even if it takes more than one year if it takes 14 months or 
15 months i think you can realistically expect an agreement 
soon said the nato chief 
bush and woerner also discussed the dramatic changes in eastern 
europe and the future role of nato 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that in 
addition to reaffirming their commitment to reaching a conventional 
forces agreement within six to 12 months the two leaders 
discussed a variety of alliance issues and developments in 
eastern europe 
bush praised woerners leadership at a time when the alliance is 
charting a new course for nato and for giving it the mission of 
working to overcome the division of europe fitzwater said 
it was at the nato summit in brussels last may that bush 
unveiled his proposal for a steep pullback of us and soviet 
troops from europe 
woerner who also met with vice president dan quayle said we 
are interested in a peaceful evolution not in unrest not in 
upheaval not in revolution in eastern europe 
woerner said nato must be seen as an instrument of the 
political management of change in eastwest relationships as well 
as the major source of stability in a time of transition 
woerner said he saw no danger of waning public support for nato 
in the west as expectations rise for political and economic reforms 
in the eastern bloc 
we have to explain to our publics that you can only guarantee 
peace and stability as long as you have this nato he said 
if there were unfortunate developments in the east he said 
it is only as long as nato exists only as long as we keep up our 
guard that soviet politicians know that there is only one way to 
solve their problems the peaceful one that there is no way to go 
militarily that there is no chance for military adventures 
we try to support the forces of reform and to support soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev insofar as he opens up the society 
improves the human rights situation and allows 
selfdetermination he said 
on the demonstrations in east germany woerner said we can 
and will not interfere with their affairs but as you can see 
there is strong pressure from inside towards reform and it must be 
clear to the leaders of east germany that only if they allow reform 
to take place this regime will be able to develop peacefully 
if they continue like they do with their tough repression 
they will not be able to manage the change he said

lawyers for the philippine government say 
ousted president ferdinand marcos and others violated an injunction 
prohibiting them from disposing of any of their assets in part to 
buy arms for an invasion 
the charges are contained in a motion filed in us district 
court friday in connection with the civil case in which the 
philippine government is seeking 5 billion it says marcos his 
family and associates looted from their country 
the motion accused imelda marcos and her deceased husbands 
worldwide network of bankers agents and associates of 
liquidating squandering and concealing assets belonging to the 
philippines in violation of a 1986 injunction 
court papers also alleged the marcoses spent 28 million and 
encumbered an additional 200 million in their swiss bank accounts 
to purchase arms for a planned invasion of the philippines 
lawyers for the philippines requested that a june court order be 
modified to more closely monitor control and account for the 
marcoses expenditures transactions and assets in order to 
prevent further violations 
the motion alleges the marcoses fraudulently transferred to 
saudi arms merchant adnan khashoggi ownership and control over two 
new york buildings four related corporations and at least one 
swiss bank account allegedly worth more than 100 million 
the allegations against the marcoses and khashoggi closely 
parallel some of the charges in a federal criminal indictment

without dissent the house foreign affairs 
committee on wednesday endorsed legislation authorizing 8375 
million in aid to prodemocracy movements in poland and hungary 
the 350 vote nearly doubling the amount proposed by president 
bush sends the legislation to the house floor for action next week 
some republican members said they were concerned about the 
spending levels authorized by the bill 
but most members of the panel said the legislation is an 
appropriate and urgently needed response to democratic and 
freemarket trends in both eastern european nations 
success with our help is uncertain but failure without our 
assistance is guaranteed said rep lee hamilton dind moments 
before the bill was approved 
the house bill includes the 200 million in aid to help poland 
stabilize its currency that bush proposed last week 
the bush administration took no position on the bill which 
would authorize spending 8375 million to aid poland and hungary 
over the next three years 284 million of that in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
the lions share of the aid would go to the more populous and 
economically troubled poland 
a democratic proposal under consideration in the senate calls 
for making 125 billion available to help poland and hungary shift 
to a freemarket economy and build democratic institutions the 
administration has proposed spending 4555 million over the 
threeyear period 
hamilton said the house bill addresses an extraordinarily 
unique opportunity to wean eastern europe away from communism 
with the united states playing a leading role 
this is an opportunity that may not come again for a long 
long time and i think we should grab it and run said rep robert 
j lagomarsino rcalif 
the chairman rep dante fascell dfla said the aid would 
lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when 
you think of the enormity of the changes poland and hungary will 
have to make to transform their staterun economies 
i can only say that after four decades in which we spent 
literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of 
western europe this is a relatively modest amount to promote the 
unravelling of comminism in eastern europe it is a very small 
price to pay said rep stephen solarz dny 
although several republicans said they had problems with the 
levels of spending only rep toby roth rwis said he was 
opposed to the entire concept of the bill 
roth contended the legislation does not adequately spell out how 
the money would be spent and represents an attempt to solve the 
problem by throwing money at it 
roth was not present for the roll call vote

a syrian major flying a sovietmade 
mig23 on a training mission defected to israel wednesday by flying 
over the golan heights and landing at a civilian air field in 
northern israel the israeli army said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin identified it as a mig23 mld 
one of the most advanced versions of the mig23 supplied to the 
syrians after 1982 asked if information obtained from the 
aircraft would be shared with the united states he said we can 
assume so 
syria and israel are archenemies and have been in a state of war 
since the jewish state was created in 1948 
a syrian official in damascus said the pilot did not defect but 
ran into mechanical problems and made an emergency landing syria 
asked the red cross to assist in his return 
it was the first time a syrian flyer was reported to have 
defected to israel although israeli forces have seized other 
syrian planes and received defectors from other arab countries 
this morning a syrian pilot escaped from syria with his plane 
a mig23 and he landed safely in israel said col raanan 
gissin an army spokesman 
he defected to israel and thats a fact gissin said adding 
it appeared to be for personal reasons 
israel radio said the pilot asked for asylum an army spokesman 
said no decision on that had been announced adding at this 
point we have nothing official to say were talking with him to 
see what he wants 
the aircraft was detected by the israeli air force and landed 
here gissin said 
he refused to say if israeli aircraft escorted the syrian plane 
or if it penetrated sophisticated air defenses as it crossed the 
golan heights captured by israel from syria in the 1967 middle 
east war 
the pilot identified as maj adel basem a 34yearold 
bachelor landed about 1115 am at an airfield used by 
cropdusting planes at megiddo 57 miles north of jerusalem an 
army communique said 
there was a companion jet but an army spokesman said as far as 
israel can tell the second jet returned to syria 
a witness named david mizrahi told israel radio he did not 
realize the plane was syrian because he saw no israeli escort 
planes 
if there were accompanying planes i would have known it was 
being brought down he said i thought it was a disguised plane 
or something 
mizrahi said an armed civilian drove a white peugeot into the 
airfield and confronted the syrian flyer 
the radio quoted other witnesses as saying the pilot raised his 
hands and said i have no intentions of war 
rabin and armed forces chief of staff lt gen dan shomron flew 
in by helicopter to meet the pilot

alabama rep bill dickinson said wednesday he 
did not violate house ethics rules when he accepted a onethird 
interest in a 300000 investment venture from a businessman whose 
companies have done 50 million in government defense work in the 
past two years 
dickinson the ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee said there was nothing illegal immoral or unethical 
about his joining with industrialist ben collier to form the 
montgomery investment club in 1986 
dickinson said he approached collier with what i thought was a 
good business opportunity and collier agreed to put 300000 into 
the joint venture the agreement provided that any profits or 
losses would be shared onethird by dickinson and twothirds by 
collier 
asked what he put into the venture dickinson replied i had 
the contacts 
house rules prohibit members from accepting gifts of more than 
100 from any individual who has a direct interest in legislation 
before congress the house ethics committee has said the rule 
applies to any individual who has a special interest in 
influencing or affecting the federal legislative process which 
sets him apart from the general public 
if hes got a direct interest in legislation i dont know what 
it is dickinson said of collier hes never asked me to vote 
any way i dont know of any legislation hes interested in and 
thats as far as it goes 
collier owns 45 percent of american apparel co which was 
formed in 1987 after collier and several associates purchased the 
assets of the bankrupt selma apparel co 
the firm now has three plants in alabama and according to rick 
cippele a part owner of the company has received 486 million in 
uniform contracts awarded by the defense logistics agency after 
competitive bidding 
collier also owns half interest in national microsystems a 
montgomery company that manufactures electronics components and 
test equipment for the aerospace automobile and appliance 
industries 
mark chesnutt director of public affairs for national 
microsystems said 3 million of the companys 9 million in total 
revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense 
contractors united technologies corp and gte government systems 
dickinson said he has promoted national microsystems among 
defense contractors just as he has promoted other businesses in 
his district that are interested in defense subcontracting work

the constitutional rights of white defendants 
are violated if prosecutors keep blacks off juries the lawyer for 
a white man convicted of rape argued wednesday before the supreme 
court 
cook county ill public defender donald s honchell wants the 
court to order a new trial for daniel holland and to give him the 
authority to object to the removal of prospective black jurors 
honchell faced tough questions from justices antonin scalia and 
byron white who said only the pool of jurors should be 
representive of the community not the jury itself 
youre driving up hill in this case white said 
prosecutors without explanation may reject 12 prospective 
jurors by using peremptory challenges the defense also has 12 
peremptory challenges 
in hollands case two challenges were used to remove two 
blacks though prosecutors said the disqualifications werent 
racially motivated 
its a level playing field scalia said of the jury 
selection process each side gets their peremptories why isnt 
that a perfectly rational system 
this court honchell said can utilize the sixth amendment 
to say white defendants have a right to complain 
the sixth amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial 
an allwhite cook county jury convicted holland in 1981 of rape 
sexual assault armed robbery and kidnapping 
five years later in a case involving a black defendant and 
black jurors the supreme court barred prosecutors from 
disqualifying potential jurors based on race 
holland took his case to the us supreme court after the 
illinois supreme court said a white man lacks the legal standing to 
challenge the exclusion of blacks from a jury 
cook county assistant states attorney inge fryklund argued that 
decision by the state court should stand 
petitioner holland got exactly what the sixth amendment 
provides she said 
the supreme court will issue an opinion next year 
the american civil liberties union and the national association 
for the advancement of colored people legal defense and education 
fund support holland 
in a brief filed with the court the groups cited a 1975 supreme 
court ruling that upheld a male defendants right to challenge the 
exclusion of female jurors 
on may 4 1980 holland offered a ride to a 17yearold girl and 
her boyfriend both white after the couples car had two flat 
tires holland then pulled a knife and told the boy to get out 
he raped the girl forced her to perform oral sex and stole 60 
before leaving her in an alley he was sentenced to 85 years in 
prison

the agriculture department has suspended a 
grain company from participating in a farm export program because 
of the companys ties to a fugitive commodities trader in 
switzerland 
the company richco grain ltd has received 95 million worth 
of governmentowned grain as subsidies under the export enhancement 
program since 1986 
usda temporarily suspended the company effective sept 29 
because of its connections to marc rich and a rich associate 
pincus green both fled to switzerland in 1983 before their 
indictment for criminal tax evasion racketeering mail and wire 
fraud 
kelly shipp a spokesman for agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said wednesday there was cause for concern about the 
involvement as rich and green as company stockholders and that the 
agencys inspector general was continuing to investigate 
robert thomajan an attorney for richco said the company would 
appeal the usda action he declined to comment on the extent of 
richs control over the company but maintained it was not an 
adequate reason for the suspension by usda he said richco had 
performed admirably in the export program 
the department began investigating the company earlier this year 
at the request of rep dan glickman dkan the chairman of a 
house agriculture subcommittee that oversees the farm export 
program 
glickman contended richco a swissbased company should not 
qualify for taxpayerfinanced subsidies through eep because rich 
appeared to exert control over richco and share in its profits 
usda according to glickman determined that rich and green who 
also lives in switzerland and faces charges in the tax evasion 
case hold more than 51 percent of richcos stock 
he is getting a gratuity from the united states of america in 
participating in this program said glickman its unbelievable 
that the program could be operated so loosely 
under the program private exporters can sell us commodities 
at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free 
government grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies the 
commodity bonuses are designed to go to foreign buyers to help 
sweeten the deals and counter what us farm groups consider unfair 
trading practices by overseas competitors particularly the 
european economic community 
there have been more than 8 billion in farm sales through eep 
which was established by the 1985 farm law at the end of july 
subsidies valued at nearly 26 billion had been provided through 
the program 
although pleased that usda acted against richco glickman 
criticized the agency for moving too slowly 
obviously this is a very embarrassing situation to the 
department but i still dont know to this day why it took them five 
months to do this said glickman 
according to usda richco has received eep subsidies valued at 
95 million mostly barley and wheat for sales to saudi arabia 
romania china the soviet union colombia poland and india 
most recently richco picked up subsidies estimated at 277000 
for a wheat sale in may to the soviets earlier this year richco 
ranked ninth among grain exporters in amounts of eep subsidies 
us authorities have been unable to extradite rich from 
switzerland the government alleges that rich and his 
commoditytrading empire cheated the treasury out of millions of 
dollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions among 
richcontrolled companies forbes magazine has identified rich and 
green as among the nations wealthiest people with each having an 
estimated net worth of 775 million

the house agreed wednesday to allow federally 
paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
reversing nearly a decade of more restrictive votes and inviting a 
veto from president bush 
by a 216206 vote the house rejected the language it has kept 
in the law since 1981 and instead endorsed a more liberal provision 
already passed by the senate an effort by conservatives to reverse 
the vote then failed 212207 
federal aid for abortions available under medicaid is now 
limited to poor women whose lives have been endangered by a 
pregnancy 
wednesdays vote came three months after a supreme court ruling 
giving states greater powers to restrict abortions 
lawmakers and activists who say women have a right to an 
abortion said the ruling spurred supporters of their position to 
make their views known to their legislators opponents agreed 
the political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if 
president bush vetoes this hed be making a big mistake said 
rep barbara boxer dcalif who led the fight for the eased 
limitations 
rep henry hyde rill who has led the antiabortion fight in 
the house for years said i couldnt characterize it any other 
way than as a defeat for the unborn i was surprised upset and 
disappointed 
house members without strong positions felt they had the 
supreme court to protect them until the july ruling said rep 
dale kildee dmich and a supporter of tougher restrictions 
now however its no longer a vote cast in a vacuum its a 
vote with real consequences he said 
the provision agreed to by the house would allow medicaid 
payments for abortions when the mothers life is in jeopardy or 
when the pregnancy resulted from a rape or incest that was 
promptly reported to authorities since 1981 and as recently 
as aug 2 the house has voted for language limiting federal aid 
to abortions only in cases in which the womans life was in danger 
just a year ago the senate caved to the restrictive house 
position on medicaid abortion financing by a vote of 4743 
the abortion provision is part of a 1567 billion measure to 
finance labor health and education programs for fiscal 1990 which 
began oct 1 the spending bill which was approved 36456 now 
moves to the senate 
bush threatened in august to veto the bill if it contains the 
more liberal abortion language administration officials reiterated 
that threat wednesday 
the presidents senior advisers would recommend a veto if 
congress sent him a bill that would pay for abortions in cases 
beyond when the life of the monther is endangered said alixe 
glen a white house spokeswoman 
vice president dan quayle answering a reporters question 
during a photo session said there is no retrenchment at all by 
the president on this very important issue 
just one disagreement remains to be settled between the two 
chambers before the legislation goes to bush whether to accept a 
senate proposal to ban federal aid to programs that buy hypodermic 
needles for intravenous drug users unless the president certifies 
that the effort helps prevent the spread of aids 
the bill also contains more than 15 billion for aids research 
and treatment 4 billion for jobtraining programs 19 billion 
for alcohol drug abuse and mental health programs 117 billion 
for welfare programs and 21 billion for education for the 
handicapped 
the vote was the second abortion showdown in the house since the 
supreme courts july 3 decision in the webster vs reproductive 
health services case 
on aug 2 the chamber voted to dramatically liberalize abortion 
restrictions in the district of columbia that was the first time 
since 1980 that the chamber had rejected tighter limits 
the august vote was considered less politically risky than 
wednesdays because it affected only residents of the nations 
capital leaving unchanged federal laws that affect the whole 
country 
as have countless congressional debates on abortion wednesdays 
fight was raged over the rights of the mother and the rights of the 
fetus 
rape and incest is a tragedy nobody says it isnt said 
hyde but why visit on the second victim the unborn child that 
is the product of that criminal act capital punishment 
boxer countered for the sake of human compassion at least 
allow the females of this nation to decide for themselves along 
with their god whether they will undergo an abortion 
at several points the debate took a personal turn 
im a psychiatrist and a physician who has treated victims of 
both rape and incest said rep james mcdermott dwash i must 
tell you the last thing victims of assault need is to have control 
over their own bodies taken away from them yet again by the 
government 
rep jim lightfoot riowa spoke against liberalizing the 
medicaid constraints saying he spoke for the children who 
possibly were the result of an inconvenience rape incest or 
maybe a good time in the back seat of a chevrolet i happen to be 
one of those i have no idea why i was conceived or what happened 
in a letter sent to lawmakers and dated tuesday health and 
human services secretary louis sullivan said the bush 
administration opposes easing restrictions on medicaidfinanced 
abortions for both philosophical and administrative reasons 
sullivan said it would be difficult to write regulations to 
determine when rape or incest has occurred 
medicaid financing for poor womens abortions has been 
restricted in one way or another since 1977 
in 1979 the last year for which reliable figures are available 
there were 72 federally subsidized abortions in the united states 
according to the private alan guttmacher institute 
in fiscal 1987 the most recent statistics available the 
federal government paid for 322 abortions at a cost of 160000 
the institute says states financed 189000 abortions that same 
year 
there are an estimated 16 million abortions performed legally 
in the united states each year

communist leaders in east germany have little 
choice but to make reforms such as those occurring the soviet 
union two top west german officials said wednesday 
its inconceivable that east germany will stay as it 
is in view of changes in the soviet union poland and hungary 
west german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg told reporters 
stoltenberg who met tuesday with president bush and nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former west german defense 
minister who visited bush on wednesday spoke at separate news 
conferences 
the major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue 
like they do their tough repression they will not be able to 
manage the change they will not be able to peacefully develop 
their countries woerner said about east germany 
they get more and more isolated and i think that is reason 
enough to change 
stoltenberg said the repression used by china to crush its 
student democracy movement wasnt a real alternative for east 
germany 
but if they dont take the chinese example they have to move 
in the other direction he said otherwise the economic and 
political situation will deteriorate because people have no 
motivation for work and have no motivation to participate under the 
existing patterns 
stoltenberg said earlier that mikhail gorbachevs attempts to 
urge reforms on east germany have been weakened because of his own 
problems at home 
gorbachevs influence in the warsaw pact countries is not as 
great as the soviet leaders was five years ago because he 
has more and more domestic difficulties he said he has 
influence but not i think to the same extent as his 
predecessors had 
gorbachev leader visited east germany last week expressing 
confidence in erich honeckers ruling communist party however 
gorbachev urged honeckers government to work with all forces in 
society to tackle problems facing east germany 
honecker indicated he would continue his hardline approach and 
not follow the reforms adopted in the soviet union poland and 
hungary 
there have been mixed signals from the east german government 
since gorbachevs visit with some calls for reform as the country 
grapples with how to staunch the flow of refugees to the west 
more than 100000 people have left east germany this year many 
in recent weeks 
we do not know what gorbachev said to honecker when he was 
there because they had a closed session of course stoltenberg 
said but from some remarks some of his close officials made to 
west german counterparts in private conversations we think that he 
advised them to do some reform steps 
stoltenberg who arrived here monday has met with vice 
president dan quayle defense secretary dick cheney and secretary 
of state james a baker iii 
he will visit us and german forces at military bases in 
norfolk va and texas before returning to west germany on friday

new york a committee of us roman catholic bishops wednesday 
criticized alleged israeli human rights abuses in the west bank and 
gaza and called for palestinians to be included as equal partners 
in negotiations for a sovereign palestinian homeland 
the draft statement by the ad hoc committee on the middle east 
praised the united states for opening discussions with the 
palestine liberation organization and asked the administration to 
take a more active role in negotiating a peace in the middle east 
that meets the security needs of israel and the longdenied 
rights of palestinians 
it is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists 
in the middle east and that the united states has an indispensable 
role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this 
statement said the committee made up of archbishop roger mahony 
of los angeles cardinal john oconnor of new york and bishop 
william keeler of baltimore 
the statement toward peace in the middle east problems and 
principles will be presented to the nations 300 bishops at the 
national conference of catholic bishops fall meeting nov 69 in 
baltimore 
some us jewish leaders welcomed the bishops support for 
israel but said they were troubled by parts of the statement 
including what they said was the bishops premature support for a 
sovereign palestinian homeland 
the bishops also failed to give equal weight to israels very 
real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining order in the 
territories and a 40year history of terrorist attacks by 
palestinians said rabbi a james rudin national interreligious 
affairs director of the american jewish committee and judith h 
banki his associate 
an arab leader applauded the bishops draft document 
the addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of 
palestinian independence is an historic development at a critial 
juncture in the palestinianisraeli conflict said abdeen jabara 
president of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
history will record that the moral authority of the american 
catholic church was indisputably on the side of peace in the middle 
east 
the bishops said the statement was devised after consultations 
with the vatican religious leaders in the middle east us 
policymakers on the region and major jewish arab and christian 
organizations 
all the groups the bishops met with were very very grateful 
for the role of the catholic bishops said mahony the committee 
chairman who described the prelates role as one of being 
instruments of peace 
we see this as a moral challenge there is a better way to 
live he said 
the intefadeh the rebellion by palestinians in the 
israelioccupied territories of the west bank and gaza since 1987 
has recast the policy agenda in the middle east by bringing 
palestinian claims to the forefront the bishops said 
the uprising is a cry for justice and personal and 
political identity that demands on both moral and political 
grounds a response by the united states government the bishops 
wrote 
the bishops cited several alleged israeli human rights abuses in 
the occupied territories including beating deaths of palestinians 
and people not involved in demonstrations the demolition of homes 
and arrest and detention without trial 
american support for israel is basically a sound policy the 
bishops committee said but it does not conflict with concern for 
human rights 
the united states also must go beyond the approach taken in the 
camp david accords of the 1970s which gave palestinians a 
secondary role in the peace process and grant their right to 
participate as equals through representatives selected by 
palestinians in all negotiations affecting their destiny the 
bishops said 
having opened political discussions with the plo in december 
1988 the united states now has the opportunity to use its 
influence and relationships to foster a more extensive dialogue 
among israel palestinians and the arab states the bishops wrote 
the bishops also called upon the arab states and palestinians to 
recognize israels right to exist 
the time is long since past when this basic element of 
international life should be affirmed for israel the committee 
said 
the bishops specifically asked the arab nations to establish 
full diplomatic relations with israel and for all nations involved 
in the peace process to pressure syria to withdraw from lebanon 
one us jewish leader said the statement is worthy of 
discussion but its credibility is undermined by a failure to call 
upon the vatican to establish full diplomatic relations with israel 
it is incongruous of them to ask the arab states to establish 
such diplomatic relations while not asking the vatican the seat of 
the roman catholic church to do so said elan steinberg 
executive director of the world jewish congress 
mahony said the issue of vatican relations with israel was not 
in our jurisdiction or our competence

fans generally were enthusiastic about the 
world premiere of holy blood and crescent moon an opera by 
stewart copeland former drummer of the rock group police but a 
newspaper music critic panned it 
music is the heart and soul of opera and copelands score 
rises only at a few isolated moments to anything that makes us care 
about his characters robert finn of the cleveland plain dealer 
said in a review published wednesday it is full of nervous 
orchestral busywork 
we are left here with a wellintentioned but essentially 
amateurish work 
finn added give the young pop composer credit for not making 
some sort of poporiented opera out of his subject he has tried 
for something serious and genuine 
the curtain had to be held for 15 minutes tuesday night while 
hundreds of lastminute ticket buyers found their seats 
david bamberger general manager of the cleveland opera said 
more tickets were sold for copelands opera than any other grand 
opera the company has produced 
for spectator brent brown 22 of painesville the idea of a 
rock star moving into the traditionladen world of grand opera is 
exciting hes bringing new ideas to high opera said brown in 
dinner jacket and red bow tie 
copeland who spent six years with the rock group police and has 
scored movies and television shows took four years to write the 
opera a tale of the crusades in the middle east 
cleveland opera officials said it is the first time a major 
figure from popular music has written an opera since george 
gershwin wrote porgy and bess 
copeland 37 decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984 when 
he wrote music for a ballet for shakespeares king lear for the 
san francisco ballet he said he would write another ballet after 
i finish my opera 
bambergers son stephen heard the remark and urged his father 
to contact copeland 
holy blood and crescent moon will be performed again 
thursday through sunday at the state theater and in march 1991 in 
fort worth texas 
producers from several opera companies across the country were 
invited to the cleveland performances

the committee that awarded the nobel prize for 
medicine to two american scientists should have recognized the 
contributions made by a french researcher frances minister for 
research and technology said wednesday 
i share the deep regret of not having seen the name of 
professor dominique stehelin attached to the nobel prize for 
medicine henri curien told the national assembly in response to 
a lawmakers question 
stehelin was the principal signer of the first article in the 
scientific magazine nature in 1976 on the discovery of the cellular 
gene which is at the origin of cancer 
the article was also signed by san francisco scientists j 
michael bishop and harold e varmus who won this years prize for 
cancer research and researcher peter vogt 
the nobel jury judged it fine to keep only the names of the 
two california scientists curien said i can assure you there 
are some others like professor peter vogt who are also very 
disappointed 
stehelin a research director for the national center for 
scientific research at the pasteur institute in lille said monday 
that the decision to award the prize only to bishop and varmus was 
unfair and rotten 
bishop and varmus who work together at the university of 
california school of medicine in san francisco have called 
stehelins work crucial to the discovery of oncogenes which 
control normal growth cells and their division 
the discovery showed cancer develops when the function of 
oncogenes is disturbed and cells grow without control

the discovery of a key engine part from a 
jumbo jet that crashed in july intensifies the search of iowa 
cornfields for other pieces to the puzzle of what caused the 
dc10s rear engine to fly apart officials said wednesday 
we dont know yet whether this is the golden nugget were 
looking for said jim burnett a member of the national 
transportation safety board but were glad we found it 
officials of general electric co which made the engine in 
1972 said the discovery of the fan disk of the crippled dc10 that 
crashed july 19 while trying to land at the sioux city airport is 
important to the investigation into what happened to united flight 
232 
this is the key to the whole search said jerry clark a 
flight safety investigator for ge clark spoke at the storm lake 
airport before the fan disk was flown to ges evendale jet engine 
plant in suburban cincinnati where it arrived later in the day ge 
spokesman rick kennedy said federal inspectors went to the plant to 
oversee inspection of the part 
one hundred searchers hired by ge will walk newly harvested 
fields in northwest iowa this weekend 
flight 232 crashed while trying to land at the sioux gateway 
airport after its aft engine disintegrated in flight throwing 
parts that severed all the planes hydraulic lines the jumbo jet 
cartwheeled across the runway in a fiery crash that killed 112 
people 184 people survived 
farmers have been recovering small pieces of the no 2 engine 
for several weeks but investigators said the key to what happened 
is apparently the 290pound titanium disk that holds fan blades 
but on tuesday janice sorenson was running a combine through 
corn a halfmile from her house on her farm about 10 miles north of 
alta alta is about 80 miles northwest of des moines 
i felt a resistance against the combine so i backed up and i 
looked and i could see the fan blades protruding from the ground 
mrs sorenson said 
she said the disk was buried between 6 and 8 inches it was 
all in one piece but there were pieces of fan blades that had been 
broken off 
what she had found was about twothirds of the fan disk 
assembly which looks like a windmill 
burnett said it is too early to assume that a flaw in the disk 
caused the crash the metallurgical examination of the disk 
itself if in fact the problem originated there should in fact 
reveal the cause burnett said 
hopefully it is something that will answer a lot of technical 
questions and might do so in short order he said 
it is unlikely he said that the ntsb will reveal results of 
tests before a hearing that begins oct 30 in sioux city 
in evandale ohio ge plant spokesman david lane would not 
theorize about what might have gone wrong with the disk which 
probably was made in the early 1970s but said ge was eager to see 
the part 
this is a very significant find in our eyes he said 
mrs sorenson 58 said she knew immediately what the piece was 
because ge had distributed pictures to farmers 
i was shocked and i was very happy for ge because they put a 
lot of time in it she said hopefully it will solve some of 
the problems theyve been looking for 
ge lawyer stephen gadd said mrs sorenson will receive a portion 
of the 50000 reward it offered for the disk equal to the 
percentage of the disk she recovered plus separate rewards for 
each fan blade the company is paying up to 1000 each for 
recovered blades 
clark said he hopes the weekend search will yield results now 
that fields no longer have 10foot stands of corn 
a lot of important parts are still missing and are out there 
somewhere he said including 16 of 20 bolts that held the disk 
to the engine

the us border patrol is trying to 
determine if a smuggler of illegal aliens locked four men in a 
trailer on a railroad car where they were killed by a pesticide 
used to fumigate the trailer agents said wednesday 
autopsies showed the four men found in the trailer and a fifth 
found along the railroad tracks 60 miles away were killed by the 
pesticide officials said wednesday 
border patrol agents suspect the men were locked in the trailer 
by smugglers in harlingen where the train left monday night for 
houston 
at this point that appears to be the case although were not 
ready to issue a complete report on that said border patrol 
chief silvestre reyes of mcallen 
we do believe that there was smuggler involved we believe we 
have a lead on a smuggler he said 
a smuggler may have arranged with someone to open the trailer 
doors once the train stopped in victoria where at least one of the 
men was destined reyes said 
four victims were found tuesday in the truck trailer being 
hauled piggyback on a flatcar on a rail siding in victoria 
the fifth was spotted later near sinton a small town about 60 
miles away where the train had stopped for nearly two hours 
overnight 
preliminary autopsy reports from travis county medical examiner 
robert bayardo and nueces county medical examiner joseph rupp 
showed all five died of asphyxiation by hydrogen phosphate gas 
the gas was emitted by phostoxin pesticide packets tossed into 
the trailer to kill boll weevils and other vermin in its cargo of 
corn flour or masa during the rail trip 
one of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those coins 
were black indicating there was poison in there victoria 
justice of the peace sylvia white said of one autopsy report 
complete toxicology reports could be issued later in the week 
she said 
the trailer had two warning stickers the size of license plates 
on its doors they showed skulls and read in english and spanish 
danger this trailer is being fumigated and do not enter 
one of the victims was from the state of guerrero mexico one 
had documents from honduras and a third had papers that had been 
stamped in el salvador but indicated he was from venezuela 
officials said authorities have found no identification for the 
two others 
four other illegal aliens noticed the five were sluggish during 
the stop in sinton police said 
victoria police lt jack williams said the four who rode the 
same train found one man on the ground at sinton 
but they thought he was intoxicated williams said they 
tried to wake him but were unable to so they moved him off the 
tracks then they went back to the truck where the man had been and 
found the others passed out 
we dont know if he got off by himself or he had help san 
san patricio county sheriffs investigator johnny segovia 
one of the four surviving aliens was treated at a victoria 
hospital after complaining of nausea diarrhea and lightheadedness 
believed to be related to inhaling the gas police said 
phostoxin is one of three commonly used fumigants for grain 
products said max woodfin agricultural resources protection 
officer for the texas department of agriculture 
he said phostoxin leaves no residue once the facility has been 
properly ventilated for at least 24 hours after fumigation

east german communist leaders reaffirmed their 
commitment to doctrine but expressed willingness wednesday to 
discuss reform in search of an attractive socialism to counter 
growing discontent with the rigid regime 
a statement from the ruling politburo capped a day of 
conflicting signals about whether the east germans would maintain 
the course of hardline leader erich honecker or join the reform 
spreading through eastern europe 
in addressing the flight of tens of thousands of east germans 
the statement said we arent indifferent when people who worked 
and lived here renounce our german democratic republic the reasons 
for the step could be varied we must and will seek out them among 
ourselves each in his place all of us together 
together we want to discuss all of the basic questions of our 
society which must be solved today and tomorrow and suggestions 
for a strategic conception of continuity and change will be 
made at a central committee meeting scheduled for late november or 
early december the politburo declared 
all expressions of opinion and suggestions for attractive 
socialism are important said the statement distributed by 
the official news agency adn we are open to discussions 
it did not mention the growing opposition movement but urged 
east germans to refrain from the kind of street demonstrations that 
swept the country last week and on monday night 
earlier wednesday party sources said highranking communist 
officials had warned of possible labor unrest and demanded a report 
from honecker 77 on the nations critical situation kurt 
hager the party ideologist reversed himself and called for reform 
to curb the growing unrest 
the demand for a report made in the politburo meeting tuesday 
suggests honecker may face an internal challenge to his 18year 
leadership the sources disclosed it soon after the radio broadcast 
hagers remarks 
party sources quoted the complaining officials as telling 
honecker there are increasing signs of coming strikes in the 
factories and there is no time to waste 
honecker was told some workers already were refusing to work 
overtime and called on the government to address the increasingly 
pressing questions of the the nations people the sources 
reported he was asked to report by the end of the week they said 
politburo member egon krenz was responsible for the restraint 
shown by security forces to show restraint during mondays 
prodemocracy demonstrations in leipzig east berlin and dresden 
the sources said krenz often is mentioned as a successor to 
honecker 
late wednesday adn said honecker had postponed a visit to 
denmark scheduled for oct 2526 no reason was given 
hager one of the hierarchys most influential figures 
recommended a greater role for the people in solving national 
problems a more open society and reform of the statecontrolled 
news media he did not suggest specific actions 
the ideologist also 77 made the recommendations in an 
interview saturday with the soviet weekly newspaper moscow news 
while street protests were under way and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev was visiting east germany 
state radio read his comments wednesday earlier in the day the 
party newspaper neues deutschland vigorously defended the countrys 
communist system 
our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear 
concept for the development of necessary changes said hager who 
has been known as a hardliner opposed to the gorbachevstyle 
reforms in eastern europe 
that will require above all the active involvement of the 
people in solving important problems and a new policy of public 
information a freer and broader discussion is developing in the 
press 
virtually all news media are under strict official control 
referring to the mass exodus mostly of skilled young people 
hager said all of the obstacles have to be cleared away that 
have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full 
potential 
he said the government should respond to the needs and mood 
of the people 
during his twoday visit last week for east germanys 40th 
anniversary gorbachev urged honecker to make democratic reforms 
in bonn chief government spokesman hans klein repeated west 
germanys offer of wideranging help if east germany implements 
reforms 
guenter krusche head of the lutheran church in east berlin 
told deutschlandfunk radio in cologne west germany he was 
optimistic that a dialogue will soon start between the nations 
leadership and the opposition movement 
party officials in dresden leipzig and magdeburg have either 
started talks with prodemocracy activists or plan them west 
german news reports say

the owners of a ship wrecked off 
scotland in 1941 with 20300 cases of scotch whisky on board said 
wednesday they plan to salvage whats left of the cargo 
despite the efforts of police and customs officers most of the 
cargo was looted by the hebridean islanders of eriskay and the 
neighboring islands of south uist and barra when the politician was 
wrecked on rocks off eriskay 
the ship made eriskay famous and brought it a tourist trade that 
continues to this day 
salvagers believe the wreck buried in sand in 20foot waters 
off eriskays north coast still contains 2000 to 4000 cases of 
whisky and possibly eight metal cases of jamaican currency said 
spokesman frank gilfeather 
the owners of the salvage rights include several financiers a 
diver and a lawyer he said 
the group plans to offer shares to the public to raise a minimum 
of 800000 needed to recover the sunken cargo gilfeather said 
the operation is expected to take place in the spring he said 
i dont think anybody would take the chance of drinking the 
whisky gilfeather said it would be a collectors item 
the booze was so plentiful on eriskay in the 1940s that women 
were seen pouring it on peat fires to make them burn more easily 
the wreck gave novelist compton mackenzie the plot for his comic 
novel whiskey galore it was made into a film of the same name 
in 1948 but renamed tight little island for release in the 
united states

the florida legislature adjourned its 
special session wednesday after refusing to pass any of the 
restrictions on abortions that gov bob martinez demanded 
adjournment came just one day after lawmakers convened the 
special session that martinez called after the us supreme court 
ruled that states could impose limits 
the session had attracted thousands of demonstrators on both 
sides of the issue 
a right having been established is not easily removed 
house speaker tom gustafson said once the right to choice was 
established and clearly understood the right to privacy 
established and clearly understood people do not willingly give up 
those freedoms 
lawmakers in the house and senate shot down proposals that would 
have curbed abortion in many ways including cutting public 
financing and toughening clinic regulations 
the session first in the nation after the supreme court ruling 
had been viewed as a bellwether more than 10000 demonstrators 
descended upon the quiet southern capital to wage the first pitched 
battle since the july decision that upheld missouri abortion limits 
the governors original goals included banning public financing 
for abortions requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women at 
least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women 
seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses 
martinez conceded his initiative had faltered badly 
i dont think its a moment for rejoicing the firstterm 
republican governor said if anything its a moment of sadness 
the governor criticized lawmakers for failing to bring any of 
his proposals up for a full floor vote 
you cant make a determination by a handful of people in a 
committee on an issue this vital he said i think that the 
will of the people would have been better served if all the people 
would have been represented 
but national leaders of the prochoice movement seized the 
opportunity to call the failed session a sign of a turning tide 
florida has just sent a message to the nation said eleanor 
smeal president of the fund for a feminist majority and a former 
president of the national organization for women political 
leaders are getting a publicopinion message that they cannot 
should not restrict or interfere with womens rights any longer 
and people dont want any more restrictions on abortion 
patricia ireland national vice president of now was jubilant 
what were seeing this session is a shift by womens rights 
supporters from the defensive to the offensive she said at a 
news conference this is one of those junctures where the 
political climate has clearly changed this is creating a new wave 
of feminism that we have not had since the 1960s 
ken connor president of florida right to life said the fight 
is not over 
whats next is we go back to work we field new candidates who 
affirm the sanctity and dignity of human life he said we 
explore the potential for a constitutional amendment 
the governor had held out hope that tougher standards for 
clinics among the least controversial of the bills would pass 
but a senate committee killed three bills on clinic regulation 
wednesday after five other bills died in senate committee in the 
house six bills met a similar fate in subcommittee wednesday 
a senate committee also killed a measure to put abortion 
restrictions before voters in the form of a constitutional 
amendment that amendment would have allowed counties to raise 
property taxes to pay for the care of poor pregnant women and 
their babies and would have restricted abortions to cases 
involving rape incest the health of the mother and deformed 
fetuses 
lawmakers had predicted the session would accomplish little 
after a florida supreme court ruling last week that the states 
privacy amendment protects a womans right to an abortion 
the justices knocked down a 1988 parentalconsent law for 
florida minors seeking abortions and also ruled the state 
constitution protects womens abortion rights in the first 
trimester 
the governors rout in the abortion session was reminiscent of a 
similar drubbing he took in efforts to pass a tax on services his 
popularity took a beating and he later pushed successfully to 
repeal the law he faces reelection in 1990 
senate president bob crawford refused to speculate on the 
political damage to martinez who faces reelection in 1990 
theres probably lessons for everybody here he said 
house speaker gustafson said floridas experience should not be 
considered a crystal ball for the rest of the nation 
i think every state is different he said

four romanians have been sentenced in that 
communist country for their parts in building a baptist church 
without government permission keston college reported wednesday 
the londonbased research institute which monitors religious 
freedom in communist nations said the four baptists were sentenced 
to corrective labor sentences oct 5 in gheorghe gheorgiudej 
it said the men were required to pay part of their earnings to 
the government and live under house arrest 
nicolae iacob was sentenced to two years eight months for his 
role in building the comanesti baptist church valentin rusu to two 
years six months and mihai cretu and gheorghe iacobuta to one 
year the college said 
one sentence was believed to have been suspended keston college 
said but added that it did not know which one or how much was to 
be deducted from the mens wages 
there are 200000 baptists in romania a nation of 23 million 
romanian authorities say the church demolished may 31 was 
built without proper authorization but keston college said the men 
were charged with using stolen building materials 
the sentences handed down on two of the baptists appear to 
exceed the provisions specified in romanian law it said in a 
statement 
under the april 1973 amendments to the penal code the 
maximum sentence of compulsory labor that can be imposed is two 
years between 15 and 50 percent of a persons wages may be 
deducted 
keston college reported three other men who had apparently 
transported the building materials were being tried but there 
is no information yet as to what sentences they received

a house subcommittee voted 210 wednesday 
evening to approve a clean air bill designed to substantially 
reduce urban smog acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals by the 
end of the century 
the house energy and commerce environment subcommittee used 
president bushs clean air proposal as a first draft the bill that 
emerged from the panel included substantially tougher auto tailpipe 
emissions standards putting the california requirements into 
effect for the entire country 
just before the final vote the subcommittee substantially eased 
bushs proposal to require cleanburning auto fuels in smoggy 
cities and force automakers to build cars able to burn those fuels 
the sponsors of bushs proposal led the charge to change the 
bill which was done by a 1210 vote after top administration 
officials gave conflicting positions in simultaneous phone calls to 
subcommittee members the auto and petroleum industries had backed 
the change 
it was the first time the subcommittee had approved an overhaul 
of clean air legislation since 1977 though a review was due in 
1981 previous attempts were defeated in subcommittee or never 
reached a vote 
the bill can next go either to a second energy and commerce 
subcommittee or the full energy and commerce committee the energy 
and power subcommittee has not decided whether it wants a chance to 
examine the acid rain provisions of the bill which require major 
reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by 
coalburning utilities in the east 
the vote on cleanfueled cars would eliminate a requirement that 
automakers build a million cars annually from 1997 through 2004 to 
run on gasoline substitutes to be sold in the nations smoggiest 
cities 
the new version would allow the environmental protection agency 
to order the cars built but only after taking into account 
potential consumer acceptance technological feasibility health 
safety air quality improvement fuel availability capability of 
production and other factors 
it also would define clean fuels in a way that environmentalists 
said would bring little pollution reduction clean fuels would be 
anything that achieved the same pollution reductions from ordinary 
gasoline as is achieved by a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15 
percent gasoline 
the vote turned previous debates on bushs bill upside own with 
chief sponsors norman lent rny and john d dingell dmich 
urging the change and winning support from most subcommittee 
republicans who have general backed bush 
subcommittee chairman henry a waxman dcalif who has been 
largely critical of the bush plan strongly defended the 
presidents proposal for cleanfueled cars and accused lent of 
trashing the administration proposal you introduced 
even more bizarre were separate and conflicting phone calls 
made about 1 pm by epa administrator william reilly from chicago 
and bush chief of staff john sununu from the white house 
waxman said reilly told him to oppose the amendment sponsored 
by reps ralph hall dtexas and jack fields rtexas lent said 
sununu informed him the administration was neutral on the amendment 
sununu called my office and assured me that president bush 
does not oppose this amendment lent said he sent a member of 
the white house staff to the committee room to say the president 
does not oppose the administration does not support the 
amendment 
waxman replied i talked to reilly this afternoon and he 
informed me the administration is against hallfields i asked 
him if i could represent that as the administration position and he 
said yes 
waxman continued i dont know where the administration is and 
it may be all over the lot on both sides it tells a lot about 
how theyre handling the bill 
later waxman said the winners are going to be the oil 
industry and the auto industry he added there would be future 
fights on the same issue in the full committee and on the floor 
after bushs bill was introduced the white house called the 
clean fuels proposal perhaps the most innovative and farreaching 
component of the proposals to reduce ozone a major component of 
the haze that hangs over most american cities 
ron sykes a lobbyist for general motors corp said the 
carmakers didnt like bushs language to force them to build 
cleanfueled cars because there was no guarantee consumers would 
buy them 
the bush legislation did not specify use of any particular fuel 
but the oil industry contended it would have given strong authority 
to the epa to choose one 
oil companies said epa favored methanol an alcohol used by some 
racing cars as a pure fuel it produces much less ozone than 
gasoline but mixed with gasoline as in the 8515 ratio spelled 
out in the bill pollution reductions are less 
its major pollution is formaldehyde a cancercausing chemical 
little studied in the atmosphere 
the oil industry and lawmakers from districts where other 
alternative fuels like natural gas and propane are produced argued 
that every cleanburning fuel should have an equal chance to power 
americas future cars and contended the hallfields amendment 
would do so

the national organization for women and 
other groups buoyed by the legislatures refusal to toughen 
floridas abortion laws hope a new womensrights wave will propel 
prochoice candidates into state and national offices activists 
said wednesday 
this is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had 
since the 1960s said patricia ireland nows national vice 
president were seeing the impact of this session all over the 
country 
the prochoice forces were shocked by the us supreme court 
decision allowing states to restrict abortions and this 
legislative session became a rallying point for action the 
activists said 
ireland said now and other groups would target antiabortion 
candidates for congress governorships and statehouses for defeat 
in 1990 
what were seeing this session is a shift by womens rights 
supporters from the defensive to the offensive she said this 
is one of those junctures where the political climate has clearly 
changed 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way action 
fund a liberal political action group said politicians across the 
country should take note of what happened in florida 
todays victory will be a rude wakeup call for politicians 
hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive 
freedom kropp said legislators in other states should take 
heed prochoice politics is winning politics even in conservative 
states 
in florida now state president jane blimling said the 
organization hopes to elect eight more women in the house and five 
in the senate at present there are 16 women in the house and 10 
in the upper chamber the house has 120 members the senate 40 
she said the organizations 36 florida chapters are gathering 
information on antiabortion legislators and would use their 
stances in the next round of elections 
gov bob martinez a republican who called the special 
legislative session has seriously harmed himself among prochoice 
women voters who wont forget said eleanor smeal president of the 
fund for the feminist majority martinez is up for election to a 
second term next year 
the two democratic candidates for governor state sen george 
stuart of orlando and us rep bill nelson of melbourne have both 
criticized martinez for calling the session on the republican 
side state sen marlene woodsonhoward of bradenton just announced 
her intention to oppose the governor in a gop primary she too 
cited his antiabortion stance 
congressional seats will be reapportioned following the 1990 
census and florida could pick up as many as four seats in the 
house smeal and ireland said much of their groups resources would

senate leaders made a lastditch search 
wednesday night for a way to consider president bushs cut in 
capitalgains taxes without slowing work on a major 
deficitreduction bill 
in the house which already has passed a deficit bill that 
includes a capitalgains cut leaders bowed out of the hunt we 
basically have done our work rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee told reporters now the 
senate has to do its work 
the senate has to work out its own problems added rep bill 
archer of texas senior republican on the house ways and means 
committee 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine planned one 
last meeting on the issue with senior colleagues even as the 
senate prepared to deliberate the deficit bill 
hope springs eternal mitchell said while assailing the 
bush administrations insistence on the capitalgains reduction 
a series of closeddoor leadership meetings in the house and 
senate has been aimed at stripping all nondeficit issues from the 
deficitreduction bill presumably the big extraneous issues 
including capital gains and the democrats proposal to expand 
taxdeductible individual retirement accounts would be added to a 
new bill and considered later this year 
barring a major suprise the senate will begin work thursday on 
the bill a package of spending reductions and tax increases that 
would cut the deficit by about 14 billion this budget year that 
bill does not include a capitalgains reduction although 
supporters may try to have one added during the debate 
whether to reduce the tax on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of investments has dominated development of the 
deficitreduction bill 
bush wants a cut contending it would spur the economy and at 
least in the short run generate additional revenues for deficit 
reduction 
most democrats oppose the reduction because 80 percent of the 
tax saving would go to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
they say the cut would deepen the deficit by 67 billion over the 
next 10 years 
under senate rules it would require 60 votes rather than the 
usual majority of 51 to add a capitalgains cut to the deficit 
bill 
richard g darman director of the white house office of 
management and budget said thursday night we think we have the 
votes to win on this presumably meaning 51 why not have a 
vote he asked in an interview on the macneillehrer newshour on 
pbs 
a majority has expressed support for some form of 
capitalgains or another mitchell said on the same program 
but no majority has agreed to any particular plan no plan may 
possibly get a majority 
mitchell accused the administration of demanding special 
treatment under senate rules so that a bare majority would be able 
to approve a capitalgains cut he recalled that the minority 
republicans used the same rule to their benefit earlier this year 
and prevailed over democrats on a bill bailing out the savings and 
loan industry 
the same rules apply to everyone equally mitchell said 
it is the height of hypocrisy the height of unfairness to say 
they should benefit from the rules when they are advantaged and 
that democrats should not when the tables are turned

president fw de klerk told 
militant antiapartheid leaders wednesday he was ready to negotiate 
on black voting rights but they demanded more concessions before 
serious talks begin 
the threehour meeting with anglican archbishop desmond tutu and 
two other church leaders came a day after de klerk announced his 
decision to free eight longtime security prisoners including seven 
leaders of the outlawed african national congress 
in washington the state department welcomed the plans for 
release and urged the release of all political prisoners 
including nelson mandela the nations most famous prisoner 
i hope todays meeting will be looked on as a milestone on the 
positive road ahead de klerk said after the talks 
but tutu the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance 
of reformed churches and the rev frank chikane general secretary 
of the south african council of churches said de klerk declined to 
give clearcut responses to their demands 
we made it clear we need results chikane said without 
results we cant have negotiations 
the clergymen demanded the lifting of the state of emergency 
legalization of the african national congress and other banned 
groups the release of all detainees and political prisoners the 
lifting of restrictions on political activity and clemency for 
prisoners on death row 
if these things happen well say to our people give them 
the government a chance they are serious tutu said 
however the clergymen said they would press on with calls for 
tougher economic sanctions against south africa unless de klerk 
complied with their demands 
de klerk who became president in august said the clergymen 
were reluctant to trust his pledges to negotiate a new just 
political system 
we are really no longer arguing about the fact that all south 
africans must have a vote that all south africans must become 
involved in all decisions affecting their life he said what 
we must now start talking about is how do we structure that 
de klerk opposes a oneman onevote system and black majority 
rule he has not specified what role he envisions for blacks in the 
national government 
the president said his government planned to consult with a wide 
range of south african leaders as part of a stepbystep process to 
negotiate a new constitution 
he declined to say when the eight prisoners would be released 
but other government officials said it could be within days 
de klerk said mandelas status was not discussed at wednesdays 
meeting but the 71yearold leader is widely expected to be 
released within the next few months 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the us 
government hoped the planned prisoner releases are merely the 
first steps in a process which will see the release of all 
political prisoners including nelson mandela and the return of 
political exiles lifting of the state of emergency and associated 
restrictions on political activity and negotiations on a peaceful 
transition to a nonracial and democratic south africa 
walter sisulu the most prominent of the eight prisoners is a 
close friend of mandela and was a major african national congress 
leader before the organization was banned in 1960 
oscar mpetha who at 80 is the oldest political prisoner in the 
country is also among the eight he was seen wednesday at groote 
schuur hospital in cape town where he has spent most of his 
fiveyear prison term 
police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths from 
entering a sports stadium in the mixedrace township of athlone 
near cape town where about 3000 had gathered to celebrate 
mpethas expected release police blocked the crowd from marching 
out of the stadium and the youths sang freedom songs before 
dispersing quietly when they were told mpetha had not yet been 
freed 
the prisons service declined to give details about where when 
and how each prisoner would be released 
in addition to sisulu those to be released include four other 
men sentenced to life in prison with mandela in 1964 in connection 
with a guerrilla sabotage campaign to overthrow the white 
government 
they are ahmed kathrada 60 andrew mlangeni 63 elias 
motsoaledi 65 and raymond mhlaba 69 all identified at their 
trial as members of the high command of the african national 
congress military wing spear of the nation 
others to be freed are mpetha wilton mkwayi 66 who briefly 
took command of the military wing after the arrest of mandelas 
colleagues and jafta masemula a member of the outlawed pan 
africanist congress guerrilla organization who was sentenced to 
life in 1963 for sabotage

trade negotiations will not substantially cut 
the multibillion dollar us trade deficit with japan and it might 
go higher in the near future economists told a congressional 
hearing wednesday 
the joint economic committee also was also told that japanese 
consumers tolerance for high prices will remain an invisible trade 
barrier and that the two countries disagree on the meaning of 
open markets 
a former us trade negotiator clyde prestowitz pressed for 
the united states to develop a national industrial policy under 
which it would negotiate for results more specific than what he 
called the unworkable and unrealistic targets of open markets and 
free trade 
prestowitz is the author of trading places how we allowed 
japan to take the lead a book about the two countries economic 
rivalry 
trade is already managed in some areas and americas trade 
partners have industrial policies he said so i would like to 
see it managed intelligently prestowitz cited as examples of 
managed trade semiconductors automobiles machine tools steel 
textiles air transport and fishing 
current marketopening policies aggravate tension by spawning 
accusations of unfairness prestowitz said maintaining that 
japanese do not clearly understand what americans mean by open 
markets and american exporters do not grasp japanese urgings for 
them to try harder 
robert z lawrence senior economist at the brookings 
institution a private policy research organization urged against 
what he called a quick fix to the trade imbalance by 
negotiating for results rather than rules 
in fact the evidence suggests that the twin policies of a 
strong yen and detailed negotiations product by product are 
working if slowly to increase imports by japan he said 
managed trade he said would greatly increase japanese 
government influence over the private sector and the result would 
be to subject americas most competitive high technology industries 
to intense competition from targeted exports 
lawrence acknowledged however that the us dollars regained 
strength against then japanese yen points to little or no 
improvement in the us trade deficit with japan in the next year 
or two it could well get worse he said but if measured in 
japanese yen instead of dollars the us deficit shows decline 
the imbalance will be relatively unaffected by trade 
developments said raymond j ahearn trade specialist of the 
congressional research service 
the deficit with japan 52 billion last year will tend to 
get worse prestowitz said its going to be hard to have a 
trade surplus so long as we have low savings in the united 
states he added

one student was stabbed and six others arrested in a racially 
inflamed melee at an alabama high school and at least 300 students 
at central high school in little rock ark were involved in 
similar fistfights wednesday authorities and witnesses said 
students were sent home at minor high school near adamsville 
ala after days of racial tension sparked violence that began in 
the school cafeteria 
principal judson jones had called students to the cafeteria to 
discuss friction among black and white students when a shove 
escalated into a macespraying gunshotsfiring melee witnesses 
said 
while we were in the lunchroom two white guys came into the 
lunchroom stood up on some tables and began spraying mace in the 
faces of black students said 15yearold student kimberly 
nixon then fights broke out all over the school inside and 
outside the building 
a teacher who was not identified fired gunshots into the air 
in an attempt to break up fighting and a 17yearold senior 
johnny drummonds was treated for a shoulder stab wound and 
released from lloyd noland hospital the principal received minor 
cuts when he tried to intervene 
there was mass confusion running and screaming everywhere 
said police sgt ronald benson thirty patrol cars were called to 
the school where classes were expected to resume thursday under 
tight security 
the guntoting teacher will be disciplined said nez calhoun 
spokeswoman for the jefferson county school board 
at least 60 students half blacks and half whites were 
involved about 25 percent of the schools 967 students are black 
police said tension at the school was due partly to black gang 
activity and what black students perceive as taunting by white 
students 
miss nixon said black students were angered during homecoming 
festivities last week when a white student came to school with 
black paint on his hands and face and an afro wig on his head 
a pep rally friday at minor high was marred by yelling and 
pushing between black and white students 
the six students arrested one 18yearold and five juveniles 
had not yet been processed at the jefferson county sheriffs 
department and specific charges against them were not immediately 
available said lt earl patterson 
in little rock at least a halfdozen fistfights broke out after 
a burning effigy of a red devil mascot of a rival school fell 
from a tree across from central high onto the car of a black 
student during an outdoor homecoming pep rally principal everett 
hawks said 
fighting spread quickly spilling into school hallways 
in 1957 president eisenhower sent federal troops to protect 
nine black students who integrated central high in a mobviolence 
atmosphere 
it started out by being a ruckus like 1957 except the blacks 
were the majority and the whites were the minority simple as that 
and im black senior class president jay brown said 
the 16yearold owner of the car said he instigated a fight 
after friends pointed out a white student as the person responsible 
for damage to the auto hawks said a white student is believed 
responsible but not the one attacked by the student and his 
friends 
a hubcap and side panel near a tire on the car were singed by 
flames 
it became a real significant racial issue thats scary for us 
and tragic hawks said 
central high has 1813 students 58 percent of whom are black 
no charges were expected and no weapons were involved city 
police officer jason shook said

the hemisphere is showing a healthy 
tendency toward freedom of expression manuel jimenez president 
of the interamerican press association said wednesday 
this year has been very significant in the history of freedom 
of the press and expression in america jimenez said in his final 
report to iapa members at their 45th general assembly 
paraguay whose dictatorship under gen alfredo stroessner ended 
in a coup by gen andres rodriguez earlier this year is on the 
road to reestablishing after many many years a real democracy 
and also creating a climate of freedom of the press and 
expression jimenez said 
the two leading candidates for president of chile hernan buchi 
and patricio aylwin have been recognized by iapa for their 
struggle to reestablish press freedoms after 16 years of military 
rule by gen augusto pinochet he said 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortaris announcment that 
the government would sell its newsprint monopoly was received with 
great surprise and satisfaction he said 
theres no doubt that all the above represents extraordinary 
news and that there exists in the continent a healty tendency 
toward freedom of expression jimenez said 
but as there have been exceptionally good things the republic 
of panama remains a dark and nebulous point he added 
there the government of gen manuel noreiga recently 
terminated the only vestige of freedom of expression and has seized 
the last independent television channel said jimenez of the 
daily newspaper la nacion in costa rica 
the result of the feb 25 national elections in nicaragua will 
determine whether press freedoms are reinstated in that country he 
said 
regarding the nicaraguan elections iapa members held a lengthy 
debate over holding the organizations planned midyear meeting in 
managua in march 
although they decided to maintain the site several members said 
the organization should not become involved in the massive 
fraud expected by the sandinista government 
all the signs show that the elections are going to be a 
fraud said german ornes former iapa president and editor of the 
daily el caribe newspaper of santo domingo dominican republic 
we are talking about a possible loss of money against people 
who have lost their freedom and their lives said jim hampton 
editor of the miami herald i would be astonished if there 
werent fraud 
violeta chamorro owner of the daily nicaraguan opposition 
newspaper la prensa has vowed to restore press freedoms if she 
wins the elections 
its a statement of our principles and belief in free 
expression if a miracle occurs and violeta wins it would be a 
hell of a celebration hampton said in an interview after the 
debate 
but if the expected occurs and the election is stolen than 
its an occassion for us to point out what happens to deplore it 
and let the sandinistas know that weve got our eye on them 
hampton said 
not going to managua would be handing the sandinista 
government a real victory and would demonstrate that somehow 
were afraid to go said michael mcquire chicago tribune deputy 
managing editor for national and international news 
we would be denying ourselves an opportunity of fulfilling one 
of our most noble purposes and demonstrating solidarity with 
our collegues who are being suppressed and suffering indignities 
mcquire said 
in another iapa matter the organizations general assembly 
recommended that member newspapers publish a 400word editorial 
regarding tuesdays killings of colombian journalists and the 
attack on the life of a salvadoran journalist and the death of his 
wife 
the climate of terror imposed by the drug cartels on the free 
colombian press has no comparison in the history of the 
continent said the editorial written by augusto nunez of the 
daily newspaper o estado of sao paulo brazil 
dictatorships and authoritarian regimes that for many decades 
have punished the american nations always have included independent 
journalists among their favorite targets he wrote 
but those governments never have tried to institutionalize the 
systematic extermination of those journalists that defend laws and 
institutions nunez wrote

command said two soldiers were slightly hurt when acid was thrown 
at them in the west bank town of hebron 
two firebombs were thrown at an israeli car in annexed east

a bomb exploded under a truck in a jewish neighborhood in 
jerusalem slightly damaging the truck but causing no injuries 
police said 
likud hardliners rallied in tel aviv to urge rejection of a 
usproposed meeting of israeli egyptian and american officials 
to work out terms for israelipalestinian talks in cairo 
led by industry minister ariel sharon among others they view 
us secretary of state james a baker iiis idea as an attempt to 
lure israel into talks with the plo and trade territory for peace 
the twohour informal gathering was attended by hundreds of 
representatives of likuds 2400member governing central committee 
who support hardline ministers in the likudlabor government 
formed last dec 22 
if labor continues to bother us in parliament and the media 
and to seek assistance of the americans the egyptians and other 
countries i propose to go to elections economy minister yitzhak 
modai declared to applause 
they are going to lead us toward a palestinian state which 
would endanger israels existence and which they see as a guarantee 
of prosperity and peace the rift is enormous 
israel radio said shamir had asked rebellious leaders to cancel 
the session saying it would complicate the political process 
senior officials in finance minister shimon peres labor party 
appeared willing to wait but several dovish leaders in the party 
said the government should be brought down

to government dismantling said chaim ramon head of labors 
parliament faction the possibilities are open elections or 
a government led by us or being in opposition

shamir leans toward the baker idea but only on condition the 
tripartite meeting be devoted to israels own peace plan it calls

to bypass israels opposition to talks with the palestine 
liberation organization 
the coalition was shaken further wednesday when shamir sent a 
letter to peres demanding that deputy finance minister yossi

the body of the cocaptain of a 
soviet yacht participating in the fifth whitbread round the world 
race was found hanging from a tree wednesday near this seaside 
resort police said 
police said the body of alexei gryshenko reported missing 
tuesday by crew of the yacht fasizi was found by a passearching for firewood 
in a pine grove two miles from punta del 
este 
a letter written in russian and apparently dated monday was 
found nearby said police officers who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the soviet embassy in the uruguayan caserby who 
was pital of montevideo 88 
miles west of this beach resort said it had no information 
regarding the discovery of gryshenkos body 
gryshenko and skip novak of the united states served as 
cocaptains of fasizi which arrived here on oct 1 the seventh 
yacht to complete the first of six legs of the 33000mile 
whitbread race 
fasizi sponsored by pepsi cola and aeroflot the soviet 
airline was among 23 yachts that left southampton england on 
sept 2 on the 6200mile voyage to punta del este the vessels 
are scheduled to begin the next leg to fremante australia on oct 
28 
police said gryshenko wearing a blue sweatshirt jeans and 
white sneakers had been reported missing tuesday by members of 
fasiis was a legitimate sighting 
knell thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in 
queens never saw aliens or spoke with them 
i believe they have their own agenda and at this time it 
doesnt include communication said knell who addressed several 
skeptical reporters at the site where the ufo allegedly burned the 
ground 
unfortunately thats also the site where the remnants of a 
downed tree were piled killing off all the grass underneath said 
park maintenance man joe mackey 60 
if there was a spot around here burned out i woulda known 
about it said mackey who spends three days a week in the park 
its a figment of somebodys imagination 
perhaps but knells not alone some residents of mississippis 
delta region say the soviet description of a ufo is similar to a 
fastmoving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month 
lee abide jr said he first saw the object about three or four 
months ago he saw it again early wednesday while on his way to 
work at abide aero flying service about five miles south of 
greenville 
and it didnt come out of a bottle of vodka he said 
referring to some speculation about the soviet witnesses 
bill kimmel a pilot said he saw the object two days ago while 
flying to memphis tenn he said it was round metallic kept 
changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3000 feet some 
distance off his left wingtip 
there was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon 
can travel that fast he said

olivetti one of europes largest computer and office equipment 
companies was suspected of violating bans on the transfer of 
sophisticated technology to the communist bloc said italian 
foreign minister gianni de michelis 
we are now investigating in rome de michelis said adding 
that the results of the investigation would be conveyed at an oct

into the olivetti allegations was being pursued in a highly 
cooperative manner assistant secretary of state raymond seitz

said olivetti was suspected of having sold the soviets machine 
tools and computer software that was used to manufacture components 
for a highly sophisticated jetfighter known as the yak41 the 
plane is capable of taking off vertically 
another official said the sales had been going on for several 
years and involved less than 50 million 
the milan newspaper corriere della sera said in a report on the 
matter that unspecified military sources confirmed that 
olivetti sales of systems and software enabled the plane to be 
produced 
in rome premier giulio andreotti met for about an hour 
wednesday with olivetti chairman carlo de benedetti one of the 
most powerful businessmen in europe neither made any statements at 
the end of the meeting 
italy is one of 17 members of the parisbased coordinating 
committee on multilateral export controls which regulates the sale 
of high technology to communist countries problems have arisen 
often in recent years regarding sales of socalled dual use 
technology which can be converted to manufacture weapons 
the most wellknown case of such a violation involved the sale 
to the soviets of computerized milling equipment by toshiba of 
japan and the norwegian stateowned kongsberg conglomerate the 
equipment was used by the soviets to make silent propellers for 
submarines making them harder for the west to detect 
as a result congress passed legislation last year empowering 
the administration to impose sanctions including import bans 
against companies found in violation of cocom 
de michelis said the main thrust of the cossiga talks with bush 
was prospects for peace in the middle east the upcoming elections 
in nicaragua and reforms in eastern europe 
cossiga speaking on the white house lawn before his meeting 
with bush urged more financial assistance to help those political 
changes succeed 
im thinking in particular of the great polish nation that is 
currently in the throes serious difficulty in its courageous 
attempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aid 
from us he said 
seitz told reporters that bush and cossiga waxed philosophical 
about eastwest issues and the importance of defense throughout 
this period of change in europe 
later at a state dinner the american president lauded the 
friendship between italy and the united states saying the ties 
have never been stronger and paying tribute to the new 
italy as a great and growing economic power one of the worlds 
foremost democracies a strong and valued ally and a partner in the 
community of free nations 
cossiga said western nations were under an obligation to 
encourage reform in the eastern bloc countries and members of the 
european common market intend to redouble their efforts to 
establish a climate of ever greater mutual confidence and to 
restore increasingly close economic cultural and human relations 
throughout the european continent

a topranking member of the medellin 
cocaine cartel who resorted to plastic surgery to avoid arrest was 
captured and will face extradition to the united states police 
said wednesday 
meanwhile the reputed leader of the cartel the largest in the 
world reportedly asked the colombian government to begin peace 
talks with drug traffickers pablo escobar also said in the 
reported letter that news reports of previous government 
negotiations with drug lords were true 
the bogota daily el espectador temporarily closed its medellin 
office after drug lords killed two of the newspapers employees 
there and threatened to murder the bureaus remaining staff of 11 
an executive of the antidrug crusading newspaper said officials 
will study how to improve office security 
the administrative security department said the suspected drug 
trafficker who was captured jose abello silva was arrested 
tuesday in a bogota restaurant the office said in a communique 
that he had undergone facial surgery to avoid easy detection 
it also said abello is the fourthranking person in the medellin 
cocaine cartel and the most important suspect arrested since 
colombia began cracking down on cocaine lords aug 19 
in washington justice department spokesman harri j kramer said 
a federal grand jury in tulsa okla indicted abello in 1987 on 
charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine 
kramer said the justice department had requested that abello and 
a suspect arrested wednesday manuel palma be held for extradition 
palma is wanted by federal authorities in miami on charges of 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an 
operation to launder drug money kramer said 
details of palmas arrest were not immediately available from 
colombia police 
neither palma nor abello is on the us justice departments 
list of 12 most wanted traffickers but the department has said it 
wants dozens of other colombians on federal drug charges 
cornelius dougherty a spokesman for the drug enforcement 
administration said in washington abello was responsible for 
major shipments of cocaine and marijuana into the states 
colombias administrative security department said abello was 
the cartels chief of operations for colombias northern coast 
where dozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to 
400 tons of cocaine into the united states each year 
the federal police force said legal documents from the us 
government for extraditing abello were being processed 
so far colombia has extradited one suspected trafficker four 
including abello are awaiting extradition 
a letter reportedly signed by escobar and delivered to the 
director of a bogota newspaper asked for mediation by the press 
political and church leaders and the judicial branch in a direct 
dialogue between the government and the drug traffickers 
the letter reportedly was addressed to juan carlos pastrana 
director of la prensa newspaper and the text was read in a 
broadcast by the national radio network caracol 
in the same way that war decrees can be issued so can peace 
decrees be issued escobar said refering to the hardline 
measures against drug traffickers adopted by president virgilio 
barco after the aug 18 assassination of a leading presidential 
candidate 
as part of the decrees barco revived colombias extradition 
treaty with the united states and confiscated hundreds of millions 
of dollars in property believed to belong to drug lords 
escobar the presumed leader of the medellin cartel the 
largest in the world heads the list of drug suspects wanted by 
the united states 
he is listed by forbes magazine as one of the 20 wealthiest men 
in the world with a fortune exceeding 2 billion 
the letter attributed to escobar said the drug lords and the 
government first began talking before sept 1 1988 when barco 
included the traffickers in a peace plan originally offered only to 
colombias leftist guerrillas 
the president never specifically indicated that drug traffickers 
would be included and government officials have repeatedly said 
they never considered talking with the drug lords 
la prensa recently reported that barcos closest adviser german 
montoya had received messages from the traffickers seeking a truce 
beginning in september 1988 
montoya later admitted meeting once with the man carrying the 
messages former interior minister joaquin vallejo but said he did 
so without the presidents knowledge 
he said he told vallejo from the beginning that a dialogue was 
not possible 
vallejo said however that he met numerous times with montoya 
and that the contacts ended two days after suspected drug 
traffickers assassinated sen luis carlos galan aug 18 
the newspaper el espectador closed its office in medellin after 
an anonymous caller said the extraditables a group of cocaine 
traffickers had killed the two employees tuesday and would kill 
the others in medellin if the office remained open 
el espectador declares that it will be able to survive as a 
free newspaper only if the government fulfills its obligation to 
protect our lives and properties the papers directors said in a 
letter sent to interior minister carlos lemmos simmonds 
a spokeswoman for the ministers office said there had been no 
official response to the letter 
el espectador has been the most vociferous of colombias 
newspapers in editorials calling on the government to crush the 
nations drug trade

hungarian socialist party declared on wednesday that at present 
there is no communist party in hungary although there are 
communists 
in an interview with hungarian tv nyers rejected claims by 
orthodox communists opposed to the establishment of the new party 
that the old party continued to exist 
the presidium of the hungarian socialist party held its first 
meeting on wednesday as conservative communists apparently kept up 
efforts to revive the disbanded hungarian socialist workers 
communist party

change

continue to organize the hswp and are calling on all chapters to 
follow suit 
they said the delegate they sent to the party congress was not 
authorized to abandon marxismleninism the radio reported 
nyers conceded it was likely they will organize a 
communist party 
but he said those who agree with the hswp line and want to 
continue must organize a new party i do not think they can use the 
name hswp 
if the word new or original were added to the name 
however then it would be acceptable he went on 
the englishlanguage daily news in budapest said wednesday 
former party ideologist janos berecz confirmed he wants to stay 
on as a member of the old communist party karoly grosz 
secretarygeneral of the party until it was dissolved repeatedly

we are staying in the hswp and i hope that a significant segment 
of the membership will do likewise 
also on tuesday the state news agency mti said the extreme 
leftist marxist unity platform was encouraging communists to rejoin 
the old party 
another radical leftwing group the ferenc muennich society is 
also known to strongly oppose dissolution of the communist party 
nyers said the new 25member presidium at its meeting wednesday 
discussed lower level organization the fate of partycontrolled 
assets and of the workers militia the old partys paramilitary 
body 
he replied when asked about expected membership of the new party 
that it was impossible to say how many of the old partys

a key un committee decided by 
acclamation wednesday to hold a special general assembly session on 
fighting the international drug traffickers 
the general assemblys general committee decided without debate 
or dissent to have the entire assembly take up the issue tuesday 
and decide when the special session should be held most diplomats 
expect the session to be held in february 
since nearly all of the 159 members of the general assembly have 
delegates on the general committee approval of the antidrug 
special session is assured 
the general assembly seized the initiative after a british 
effort to have the security council deal with the issue was 
withdrawn after many developing nations opposed council involvement 
in a social concern 
algeria and brazil particularly opposed the expansion of the 
security council into areas other than the military aspect of 
security said diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
colombias president virgilio barco won a standing ovation from 
the general assembly on sept 29 when he called on all nations to 
ratify the 1988 vienna convention on narcotics trafficking which 
closes legal loopholes giving drug dealers safe haven in some 
countries 
the treaty strongly backed by washington requires nations to 
make drug trafficking illegal confiscate dealers property and 
bank accounts and extradite drug lords even if there is no 
applicable extradition treaty 
twenty nations must ratify the treaty before it comes into 
effect so far only the bahamas has done so and washington and 
london are considering signing 
about 100 countries have signed the treaty the first step 
toward ratification

hundreds of gay men and women across the nation celebrated their 
sexuality with rallies films and discussions wednesday on the 
second annual national coming out day 
national coming out day is great its like a holiday said 
tony cheek executive assistant at the los angeles gay and lesbian 
community services center where about 500 people gathered 
the celebration at the center included discussion of such films 
as the life and times of harvey milk about san franciscos 
murdered gay city supervisor 
cheek said the days highlight was an open microphone at which 
people could tell their own stories of coming out gay slang for 
publicly acknowledging ones homosexuality 
some were funny but there were a lot of tearjerkers he 
said we had a lot of firsttimers 
in providence ri about 50 people attended a rowdy statehouse 
rally and said they hoped to inspire tens of thousands of others to 
acknowledge their homosexuality 
none of the demonstrators was coming out of the closet for 
the first time organizers said most were veterans of other gay 
pride events and they said the real comingout process is one 
thats done privately 
my coming out was when i opened the dictionary at age 14 and 
looked up the word homosexual and realized that applies to me 
said john blakeslee 34 of providence 
at the university of massachusetts in amherst students were 
asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration black 
always a popular choice of students proliferated on campus by 
midmorning 
this campus is so diverse civility and being aware of social 
issues is really important said max mitchell a senior and 
president of the schools lesbian bisexual and gay alliance 
in boston the massachusetts senate gave all but final approval 
wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in 
housing credit and employment 
the bill which has died in the senate for each of the last 17 
years moved along after senate president william bulger ruled that 
amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying 
tactics 
this really is the peoples victory david lafontaine of the 
coalition for lesbian and gay civil rights we are going to 
herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement 
the atlanta gay center sponsored a helpline and bought local 
advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in washington 
two years ago gay residents had their names printed in the ads as 
part of the commemoration

supervisors voted 40 to proclaim wednesday marin coming out 
day despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county 
should not be endorsing gay lifestyles 
ken searle pastor at marin christian life church in novato 
said he was very disappointed because the boards action will 
be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle 
supervisor al aramburu one of two who wore coming out 
buttons said the proclamation reflects a spirit of respect 
i think we respect one another as human beings he said 
cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by 
letting the heterosexual world know that there are gays and 
lesbians all around them 
if you find out your next door neighbor that youve known all 
along is gay then how can you hate him cheek said

some aging but still popular tv shows may fade 
from the nations cable systems in january and the cable industry 
wants customers to know whos to blame the government 
the national cable television association is providing cable 
systems with short announcements warning viewers that shows such as 
cheers mork and mindy and heehaw may disappear after 
jan 1 
the reason is the return of syndex industry jargon for the 
federal communications commission regulations that allow local 
overtheair television stations exclusive rights to the 
syndicated nonnetwork programs they show in their market 
the fcc is reinstating the rules it lifted in 1980 as a way to 
boost the theninfant cable industry 
if the rules survive pending court challenges some reruns may 
disappear completely in some cities that could happen if cable 
systems forced to black out some time slots from distant 
stations that carry the same programs as local broadcasters decide 
to drop the outoftown stations entirely 
cable operators fearing a backlash from viewers are using the 
announcements as a preemptive strike to make sure customers knows 
its not their fault 
preston padden president of the association of independent 
television stations is a proponent of reinstating the syndex rules 
our entire constitutional copyright system is based on 
recognizing and honoring contracts between creators and 
exhibitors padden said 
but steven j simmons chairman of simmons communications inc 
says the rules are terribly unfriendly to consumers 
simmons whose company has 350000 subscribers in 20 states 
said broadcasters have indicated they will claim exclusivity for 
programs such as the oprah winfrey show whos the boss 
heehaw simon and simon the ateam wheel of 
fortune mash i love lucy golden girls a 
current affair donahue amen and mork and mindy 
those shows would be carried on only one station in any market 
simmons said in a telephone interview from his stamford conn 
office 
the requirements could have such an impact that a cable 
company rather than have a subscriber sit there and watch 
essentially swiss cheese may just decide to drop the channel 
altogether simmons said 
the rules would affect national superstations such as wtbs 
in atlanta wgn in chicago and wwor in new york and socalled 
regional tv stations such as wpix in new york and ktla in los 
angeles 
turner broadcasting system which owns wtbs turner network 
television and cable news network said wtbs would be 
syndexproof tbs is telling cable operators it will indemnify 
them against any syndex problems 
weve already made arrangements to have a blackoutfree 
schedule bert carp a tbs official in washington said in a 
recent interview he said tbs had managed to either acquire 
national exclusivity for its programs or acquire new programs

veteran labor leader saul 
ubaldini was voted out of office wednesday in a political victory 
for president carlos menem 
the secretarygeneral of the general labor confederation was 
unseated at a rowdy congress punctuated the day before by 
fistfights and clashes between rival union members wielding iron 
bars clubs chains bottles and stones 
guerino andreoni leader of the commerce workers union was 
elected to replace ubaldini as head of the 3 millionmember 
confederation most of the members work at state companies 
including the national airlines and railroad which have been 
losing tens of millions of dollars annually for years 
ubaldini had been considered a rival capable of undermining 
menems economic policy menem has held down workers wages as a 
way to halt inflation which soared by 197 percent in july the 
month he took office the september increase was 94 percent 
the president also pressured state rail workers to end a strike 
last month and caused concern among state employees about their 
jobs and benefits by pledging to sell moneylosing public companies 
to balance the budget 
ubaldini insisted he did not oppose menem but always stressed 
his independence 
nothing and no one will impede our fight to improve workers 
welfare he said on aug 17 hours after his car was damaged by a 
bomb 
during the 198389 presidency of raul alfonsin which ended in 
july ubaldini organized 13 general strikes and pressed for 
increases in the national minumum wage public programs to reduce 
unemployment and a halt to payments on argentinas foreign debt 
menem had tried to oust ubaldini since his laborbased peronist 
party swept presidential and congressional elections may 14 
offering the trade unionist a highlevel post in an overseas 
embassy among other things 
but the beer workers union chief who has led the labor 
confederation since 1980 refused 
menem made no immediate comment on ubaldinis ouster nor did 
labor minister jorge triaca or their ally in the trade union 
movement foodworkers union chief luis barrionuevo 
but soon after the confederations entire 20member board of 
directors was replaced late wednesday barrionuevo told reporters 
he briefed menem on the development and government house officially 
recognized the new confederation leadership 
ubaldinis term does not expire until february 1990 and the 
fiery unionist pledged to stay on until then 
we have not resigned he told cheering chanting supporters 
gathered outside confederation headquarters in san telmo 
neighborhood near buenos aires port the secretary general 
continues to be me 
in an editorial titled labor at the crossroad the 
englishlanguage buenos aires herald newspaper criticized the 
scuffles that broke out tuesday outside the convention hall where 
1600 confederation delegates gathered 
at stake is whether the government can continue to tame the 
inflation which has fallen from nearly 200 percent in july to 
single digits in september or whether a wage offensive spearheaded 
by ubaldini will drive a coach and horse through government 
incomes policy it said

suspended navajo tribal chairman peter 
macdonald was accused of 111 criminal charges wednesday including 
bribery fraud conspiracy and elections violations while he led 
the nations largest indian tribe 
special prosecutors hired by the tribal council filed a 
fivepronged complaint in navajo district court in window rock the 
tribal capital after a fourhour review of the charges by judge 
robert yazzie 
shortly before the charges were disclosed macdonald denounced 
them as baloney 
they are the same old laundry that theyve been hanging out 
for the last year and a half he told the associated press later 
after learning of the specific charges 
one complaint charges macdonald with 27 counts of bribery 
fraud ethics violations and conspiracy in the tribes 334 
million purchase of the big boquillas ranch in northern arizona in 
july 1987 
allegations that macdonald personally profited from the ranch 
purchase emerged in us senate subcommittee testimony earlier this 
year 
a second complaint alleges 25 violations of the navajo election 
law including charges that macdonald accepted 115500 in 
undocumented cash and service constributions from nonindians and 
corporations 
a third charges macdonald with 59 counts of bribery extortion 
fraud ethics violations and conspiracy in alleged fradulent 
consultant contracts macdonald purportedly entered into with 
outside businesses from november 1986 through 1989 prosecutors 
allege he pocketed over 300000 
if convicted on all 111 counts macdonald could be sentenced to 
15 years in tribal jail and fined as much as 59500 
macdonalds son peter rocky macdonald jr is charged with 
conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and tribal 
vice chairman johnny r thompson is accused of ethics violations in 
the fifth 
prosecutors did not break down the complaints against thompson 
or the younger macdonald 
court officials said people listed in the complaint would 
probably receive summonses from the navajo department of justice 
within 14 days 
the special prosecutors members of the santa fe nm law firm 
of rothstein bennett daly donatelli and hughes were appointed 
by the tribal council in march to investigate any possible 
wrongdoing by former and current tribal officials said tribal 
spokesman duane beyal 
macdonald speaking to reporters in this northcentral arizona 
community shortly before the contents of the charges were disclosed 
in window rock 150 miles southeast said the charges would be 
trumpedup 
i dont care what it is its going to be a bunch of baloney 
and whatever court it goes to its going to be proven its a bunch 
of baloney macdonald said 
he reiterated his claim that the federal government wanted to 
oust him and other strong indian leaders so it could have easier 
access to minerals and other natural resources on reservations 
we have made mistakes im sure macdonald said but we 
have nowhere near as bad a record as whites have as our trustees in 
bringing poverty and hunger and illiteracy and alcoholism to native 
americans 
we have nowhere near the record of whites in stealing indian 
land indian oil indian coal indian gas and indian water he 
said 
special prosecutor robert rothstein who released the contents 
of the complaint said 75 to 100 people were investigated 
including members of the administrations of macdonald and interim 
chairman leonard haskie 
haskie said the tribe appointed the prosecutors to protect the 
best interest of the navajo people and file charges if warranted 
he said he had has asked the federal government to expedite its 
investigation of macdonald 
that probe focuses on allegations made during the senate 
subcommittee testimony in january that macdonald and his family 
profited from the tribes purchase of the 491000acre ranch 
the council put macdonald on administrative leave with pay on 
feb 13 on march 10 it named haskie interim chairman and placed 
thompson on leave 
macdonald has said the 88member council acted illegally by 
replacing a chairman without a twothirds majority but tribal 
courts have upheld the actions 
at his news conference macdonald declined to answer questions 
about past allegations 
im exercising my rights he said when asked why he had 
resisted turning over documents sought by tribal and federal 
investigators 
assistant us attorney allen stooks of phoenix did not return a 
phone call for comment on the status of the federal investigation 
the tribe purchased the big boquillas from tracey oil and gas 
co which had bought it a short time earlier from tenneso west for 
262 million 
the tribal complaint alleges that tracey byron bud brown 
the broker and macdonald agreed to divide the 72 million profit 
among themselves 
it further alleges that macdonald concealed the ranchs true 
value from the tribe and used his position as chairman to inflate 
the ranchs appraised value speed the sale and conceal his 
personal gain 
earlier this year the tribe filed suit in maricopa county 
superior court in phoenix seeking to recover 24 million in 
damages from macdonald and others in the ranch purchase

a company cannot hide behind a 
corporate veil to avoid funding the cleanup of a toxic chemical 
spill caused by a subsidiary a federal judge ruled wednesday in 
one of the first such cases in the country 
kayserroth corps tight control over subsidiary stamina mills 
inc makes it liable to pay 846492 to clean up a 1969 release of 
trichlorethylene or tce that the government contends contaminated 
nearby drinking wells us district judge francis j boyle ruled 
kayserroth had the power to control the release or threat of 
release of tce had the power to direct the mechanisms causing the 
release and had the ultimate ability to prevent and abate 
damage boyle wrote 
deming sherman kayserroths attorney and us justice 
department lawyer cynthia huber said they believed it was the first 
superfund case prosecuted by the federal government in which a us 
judge made a parent corporation liable for the actions of its 
subsidiary 
kayserroth a hosiery and apparel manufacturer argued it could 
not be forced to pay because it was protected from liability by a 
corporate veil that shielded it from the acts of its 
subsidiary which operated a nowdefunct woolen mill in north 
smithfield 
the corporate veil a longestablished legal doctrine protects 
investors in new ventures from losing all their assets and is a 
major reason that most business activities are carried on by 
corporations 
the veil is rarely pierced and only when a parent company is 
shown to have overwhelmingly controlled its subsidiary 
the judge said kayserroth fit that category because of its 
total control over staminas finances its order that stamina refer 
environmental matters to kayserroths legal department and its 
approval of all stamina real estate deals and capital purchases 
greater than 5000 
boyle also said kayserroth executives served as most of 
staminas officers and directors 
kayserroth has exhibited overwhelming pervasive control over 
stamina mills boyle wrote 
the judge said he was concerned primarily with furthering the 
superfund laws intent to let the government collect the cleanup 
costs in hazardous waste cases 
the law attempts to address nationwide public health and 
environmental problems and places no special importance upon 
the corporate structure boyle wrote 
sherman called it a pretty broad opinion and said he 
believed kayserroth would have case law on its side if it decided 
to appeal 
the wall street journal recently reported that three federal 
judges in the past five months including boyle had declined to 
dismiss cases based on corporate veil arguments an agreement in 
principal had been reached to settle one of those cases against 
tampn plc an english holding company the newspaper said 
the government has sought to pierce the corporate veil because 
parent companies often have greater resources to pay for hazardous 
waste cleanups than do their subsidiaries 
boyle also rejected kayserroths argument that the government 
could not prove the wells were contaminated by stamina mills 
on this record it is sheer speculation to suggest that there 
was any other source of tce the judge said 
the judgment includes 660612 to the us environmental 
protection agency and 185879 to the justice department 
kayserroth also will be liable for any future cleanup costs at the 
stamina site boyle wrote

the house on wednesday refused to take up a 
measure that would have ordered the census bureau to exclude 
illegal aliens from next years census 
it was a test of strength that pitted sunbelt states whose 
populations have been swollen by illegal aliens against frostbelt 
states that stand to lose house seats after the census 
by 232184 the house used a parliamentary maneuver steered by 
rep silvio o conte rmass to keep the census measure off the 
floor 
that was the vote by which the house instructed its negotiators 
in housesenate talks to accept a provision in the senate version 
of the state justice and commerce appropriations bill to condemn 
the continuation in power of gen manuel antonio noriega in panama 
the rules permit only one set of instructions to a conference 
committee thus rep thomas ridge rpa was blocked from offering 
his own set of instructions on the census question to the house 
members of the same committee 
ridges provisions would have ordered the house negotiators to 
accept another senatepassed provision this one to barring the use 
of any money for the census bureau to count illegal aliens in its 
1990 head count 
the census bureau has always counted residents regardless of 
citizenship past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count 
have always died in committee 
the matter is important to several northeastern and midwestern 
states which expect to lose house seats in redistricting following 
that census 
under current census rules california florida and texas with 
many illegal aliens expect to gain house seats while new york 
pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois are among those expected 
to lose seats 
even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get 
a vote on the ridge proposal backers of the census change used the 
hour devoted to the noriega censure to debate the census issue 
ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political 
fairness i want equal representation for american citizens 
argued rep william goodling rpa 
opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point 
would cost 1 billion including the cost of reprinting forms and 
retraining the enumerators they said it was not clear that the 
censustakers could even get accurate information on citizenship 
rep william ford dky called it a fantasy that states 
losing seats could save any by excluding aliens from the count 
opponents have said the senate provision is clearly 
unconstitutional since the constitution requires a census of 
persons when the constitution wants something to apply only to 
citizens it clearly says citizens according to this argument 
supporters have argued that the constitution gives congress the 
power to impose rules for the census

the socialist party japans major opposition 
party was challenged in parliament on wednesday to reply to 
allegations that it tilted in favor of the pinball industry after 
being fed sizeable donations 
koichi hamada a legislator of the governing liberal democrats 
cited a published report that eight socialists helped water down 
legislation regulating pachinko a widely played form of pinball in 
which winners receive prizes 
the weekly magazine shukan bunshun said the eight received 
donations from a national association of pachinko parlor owners 
ranging from 1400 to 3500 
hamada whose own party was badly hurt at the polls this year by 
a major influencepeddling scandal addressed his questions to the 
justice minister during budget committee debate in the lower house 
there have been allegations that some legislators have acted 
to protect the pachinko industry while they were not supposed to 
do so he said 
i will not name them right now but the issue involves 
something to be called the second recruit scandal 
by recruit hamada was referring to a scandal in which leading 
politicians and bureaucrats received donations or cutprice stock 
shares from recruit co a major information services conglomerate 
accused of trying to influence government policy bribery charges 
have been filed in that case 
the justice minister replied he was aware of the allegations and 
assumed that prosecutors were interested in the case 
tsuruo yamaguchi socialist secretarygeneral has acknowledged 
that some party members received donations from the pachinko 
association including 31000 for party chairwoman takako doi but 
said all the donations were legal 
the magazine said donations to ms doi known to be a pachinko 
fan were in the form of ticket purchases for parties in her honor 
the recruit scandal and an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax 
were major factors in the liberal democrats losing their majority 
in parliaments upper house for the first time in 34 years in 
elections in july the socialists were the major gainers in the 
election 
about 15000 pachinko parlors operate across japan with annual 
sales estimated at nearly 21 billion shukan bunshun said 
to help in investigating any tax evasion by the pachinko 
industry the national police agency has sought to introduce a 
system in which customers would use prepaid cards rather than 
cash to play pachinko machines 
socialist legislators strongly opposed such a system

the bound bodies of 80 sinhalese 
youths all shot and some set on fire were found along a southern 
road on wednesday and authorities blamed progovernment death 
squads 
no one claimed responsibility but authorities speculated the 
killings were the work of death squads out to avenge the ambush 
slayings of three sinhalese soldiers in the district on monday 
the bodies were discovered one day before the government and 
opposition parties wrap up monthlong peace talks aimed at resolving 
sri lankas ethnic differences more than 16000 people have died 
in the strife 
the bodies were found in groups of six or eight along a 20mile 
stretch of road between panadura and mataguma said police 
officials who could not be identified under briefing rules 
the towns are in kalutara district about 25 miles south of 
colombo 
officials said the victims were aged 18 to 30 their hands were 
tied behind their backs and the bodies bore gunshot wounds some 
bodies were afire they said 
the ambush on monday was blamed on sinhalese militants of the 
peoples liberation front a group trying to topple the government 
for two years now 
human rights groups and opposition parties allege that vigilante 
groups are killing sympathizers of the front a charge denied by 
president ranasinghe premadasa and his government 
a foreign ministry official said wednesday that a team of the 
international committee of the red cross will arrive oct 17 on an 
invitation by premadasa to monitor human rights practices in sri 
lanka 
the official who also could not be identified under briefing 
rules said the genevabased body will send a preliminary team he 
had no details 
officials have said about 25 people a day are being killed in 
the battle between sinhalese radicals the military and death 
squads 
independent groups say the government encouraged the vigilantes 
after the military failed to put down sinhalese extremists 
the front began attacking the sinhalesedominated government 
after it signed a peace accord in july 1987 designed to give 
greater autonomy to the island nations tamil minority 
the accord followed six years of tamil insurgency in the 
northeast where most tamils live and want to set up a separate 
homeland the insurrection has claimed 11000 lives 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people they 
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the sinhalese who 
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and 
the military 
last month premadasa convened a peace conference of 21 of the 
countrys 27 recognized political parties it was boycotted by the 
front 
the conference is due to hold its final round of talks thursday

denis goldberg no longer feels uneasy in a crowd 
but whenever he sits down to write his memoirs the recollections 
of 21 years in a south african prison still overwhelm him 
he served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant 
and now is in his fifth year in british exile but he says the 
ideals that got him nelson mandela and six other black 
nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the whiteled 
minority government made his life sentence bearable 
i didnt count every day i was in prison but i calculated 
it goldberg now 56 says in an interview i was there 7904 
days i dont regret one day it was worth it 
i certainly do not repudiate my past actions i do not 
repudiate the armed struggle i think its essential 
at 29 goldberg was an engineer turned bombmaker for the 
african national congress the banned black nationalist movement 
he was arrested at an anc hideout in johannesburg and given three 
life sentences in june 1964 for campaigning to overthrow the 
government by violent revolution 
deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in 
political violence he now runs the ancs mail order business in 
north london selling mostly tshirts and posters he lectures 
occasionally in britain and abroad 
on tuesday president fw de klerk said he will free five of 
goldbergs codefendants including anc political strategist walter 
sisulu but not mandela 
the other codefendant govan mbeki was freed in 1987 
goldberg calls their release a public relations exercise to 
show de klerk is amenable to change 
it took goldberg two years to adjust to freedom in london 
finally one morning suddenly i felt at ease the crowds didnt 
bother me 
theres a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is 
enriching he says it sounds corny but its very very true i 
find life incredibly exciting fulfilling and worthwhile 
his wife esme 60 says prison made him tender 
but the memories of prison run deep 
i find that when i do sit down to write about it i simply 
dont sleep he said a recollection of one incident brings 
back a whole chain of incidents and events and i find that this 
just overwhelms me 
the former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by 
revulsion for apartheid the raceseparation system under which 5 
million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks 
hes chubbier now and losing his hair and his quirky humor 
masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up 
his son david was 8 and his daughter hilary 5 when he left 
cape town in may 1963 intent on fleeing abroad a bomb had 
exploded in his garden obscenities were painted on his car and 
police were clamping down on dissidents he stayed on briefly to 
organize arms production for the anc 
had i not been arrested i would have gone on to start 
production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so 
on he says bombmaker is a pejorative term my people said 
that what i was doing was just and justified 
goldberg served most of his sentence in the whitesonly pretoria 
prison 
in a country where prison is the norm in the lives of most 
black south africans it was perhaps a way of identifying he 
said that we could survive and come out relatively whole people 
is really a victory over people who try to smash us 
he first visited his daughter at a kibbutz in israel before 
flying to britain where his wife and son moved during his trial 
goldberg said his son who in 1985 was 29 and married with 
children needed me to tell him i hadnt left him 
i told him i didnt see how i could ever make my family above 
all other families he says kids suffer and starve not because 
their parents are politically active but thats the nature of 
apartheid and i felt i had to do something 
his eyes reddened with emotion behind hornrimmed glasses 
ive had some suffering so lots of people have died people 
are getting hanged people are getting shot im alive lifes 
great

opposition members shouted slogans and 
walked out of the upper house of parliament wednesday after the 
house chairman rejected demands that prime minister rajiv gandhi 
answer allegations in a multimillion dollar arms scandal 
gandhi was not present during the uproar in the rajya sabha or 
house of the nation but was heckled by opposition members who 
returned when he entered the chamber to announce a new employment 
scheme 
opposition members waved copies of a newspaper that published 
the allegations and demanded gandhi explain news reports of 
kickbacks being paid in the 1986 purchase of artillery from the 
swedish company ab bofors 
members of gandhis congress party who have a 142100 majority 
in the house shouted back trying to drown out opposition members 
chanting corrupt rajiv gandhi resign resign 
the opposition legislators walked out when the house chairman 
vice president shankar dayal sharma said he would permit a 
discussion on the newspaper report but would not summon gandhi 
they returned 90 minutes later when gandhi entered to read a 
statement on creating 1 million new jobs throughout the country 
and drowned most of his 30minute speech in continuous 
sloganshouting and catcalls 
the hindu a madrasbased daily said in a frontpage story 
monday that there was new evidence to prove kickbacks were paid in 
the 14 billion deal to purchase bofors howitzer guns 
newspapers have alleged that bofors paid 50 million to clinch 
the contract and that some of the money went to senior members of 
the government gandhi has repeatedly denied the charges 
the allegations were first made in 1987 but have resurfaced in 
recent months as the usually fractious opposition tries to form a 
coalition in an effort to unseat gandhi in national elections due 
by january 
the oppositions efforts to focus public attention on the issue 
have included the resignations of 100 parliament members from the 
542seat lower house or lok sabha in august the resigning 
members claimed the congress party was using its majority to stifle 
discussion on the bofors gun deal 
mondays article in the hindu said secret portions of a report 
by the swedish national audit bureau reveal that at least 31 
million were paid to a panamabased company whose majority owner 
was the indian agent of bofors in new delhi 
the article said the indian and swedish governments appeared to 
have colluded in keeping that portion of the report secret and 
releasing a sanitized version 
the newspaper printed photocopies of what it said were the 
withheld portions of the report next to the photocopies the hindu 
reprinted three public comments of gandhi reiterating that no 
indian had received money from the swedish company

three men facing charges in the worlds 
largest cocaine seizure were denied bail wednesday by a judge who 
citied a substantial risk of flight by the three one of whom is a 
professional pilot 
us magistrate volney brown agreed with prosecutors that james 
mctague 41 of el paso texas mauricio monroy 36 of mexico 
city and hugo fernando castillon 32 of los angeles had no 
reason to remain here 
a separate bail hearing was set for thursday for miguel garcia 
chavez 34 los angeles pending indictment all four men face a 
federal complaint of possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute 
they were arrested in the sept 28 seizure of what officials say 
was 21 tons of cocaine which has since been destroyed and about 
12 million in cash discovered at a warehouse in suburban sylmar 
it was the largest seizure of cocaine on record 
one defense attorney tried to close the bail hearing to the news 
media and another launched an attack on the chain of custody for 
their clients who had faced state charges before being handed over 
to federal authorities 
a lot of local politicians and officials have ridden on the 
backs of these defendants to enhance their careers said attorney 
marlene gertz representing castillon and monroy the pilot 
theres been lots of publicity and this publicity has been 
very detrimental she said in arguing for a closed hearing 
this bad publicity will continue unless the press is excluded 
the press has already convicted these defendants 
brown denied the motion without comment along with a motion by 
mctague lawyer michael pancer to dismiss the charges because the 
change from state to federal custody was an unnecessary and 
improper delay 
assistant us attorney james walsh said that with several 
agencies involved in the investigation officials needed time to 
sort out the proper jurisdiction for prosecution 
county prosecutors dropped charges friday against the four men 
so they could face charges in federal court where drug conviction 
penalties are stricter 
brown set a hearing date of oct 24 and a postindictment 
arraignment on oct 30 for all four defendants in los angeles 
also wednesday prosecutors gave an account of how much cocaine 
was seized at the warehouse 
federal agents and local police said the haul from the warehouse 
weighed 42800 pounds including packaging they subtracted about 
800 pounds for packaging leaving 21 tons 
mctague is the brotherinlaw of hector tapia anchondo 38 one 
of the alleged leaders of the smuggling operation authorities said 
mctague also identified the mastermind of the drug ring as rafael 
munoz of juarez mexico 
tapia and carlos tapia ponce 68 father of tapia achondo were 
arrested in las vegas on saturday in connection with the cocaine 
find munoz remains at large

just as the abortion battle intensifies in the 
courts and statehouses some political observers and population 
experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic 
overtaken by technology 
they say the abortion pill in growing use in france 
inevitably will reach america legally or illegally and forever 
change the argument women who want abortions will have them 
without having to visit clinics possibly without doctors and 
maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant 
to antiabortion forces the french pill is a cloud on the 
horizon it comes as the supreme court faces another opportunity to 
overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as florida 
legislators meet in the nations first special session on abortion 
since the high court in july gave states additional power to 
regulate abortions 
people on either side of the argument are spending a lot of 
energy and emotion on a political issue thats going to be 
defused says leonard a cole who teaches in the science 
technology and society program at rutgers university in newark 
nj he has looked into the likely political consequences of an 
easytouse athome abortion pill

evergrowing market since paramount home video introduced star 
trek on tape in 1985 
with unit sales for various star trek episodes on tape 
approaching 4 million others in the video business have beamed 
aboard 
now almost every kind of old program is on tape from familiar

suddenly the ecology has 
become a dominant topic in south africa 
in recent weeks tens of thousands of people nationwide have 
signed petitions denouncing industrial threats to the environment 
and the countrys first ecologyoriented political party has come 
into being 
a host of environmental problems confront south africa ranging 
from air pollution to water shortages but two events in particular 
have galvanized the public into action 
first came disclosure of plans by a britishowned company to 
mine titanium in the scenic sand dunes around lake st lucia an 
estuary and game reserve northeast of durban on the indian ocean 
james clarke environment writer for the str newspaper in 
johannesburg describes the area as one of the worlds most 
beautiful and biotically rich places 
about 200000 south africans have signed petitions opposing the 
mining project and government officials have said they will ask 
the company richards bay minerals to reassess the environmental 
impact of its plans 
in september an outcry arose when chemicals leaked into a river 
in eastern transvaal province from a huge paper mill killing tens 
of thousands of fish and disrupting water supplies for more than 
200000 people 
residents in the politically conservative area near kruger 
national park started their own petition drive demanding 
government action against the sappi paper company and expressing 
dismay and outrage at apparently lax safety measures 
within days after the chemical spill in the crocodile river 
environmentalists met in johannesburg to form the ecology party 
which has adopted a green heart as its symbol 
colin slater a marketing consultant who helped found the party 
said he had lived in west germany during the emergence of the 
greens movement and hoped the ecology party could play a similar 
role in forcing south african politicians to pay more attention to 
ecological issues 
in the past most environmental organizations in south africa 
focused on singular issues several groups have promoted wildlife 
conservation for example and others opposed the use of nuclear 
power by the staterun electricity monopoly but environmental 
awareness among the general public was relatively low 
one reason was that south africans aligned against the 
government and big business concentrated on fighting apartheid 
resistance and opposition to the government and industry have 
been dominated by the burning issues of racism and exploitation 
leaving little time and energy for organization around ecology 
wrote labor specialists eddie koch and dirk hartford recently in 
the weekly mail an antiapartheid newspaper 
but koch and hartford suggested that ecologists and 
antiapartheid activists could find common ground in opposing 
pollution the misuse of pesticides and the dumping of toxic 
wastes other commentators have suggested that the black majority 
would take a much keener interest in the environment if whites who 
control 87 percent of south africas territory agreed to a major 
redistribution of land 
the ecology partys slater said the environment has suffered 
neglect because of the tremendous daytoday emphasis on 
blackwhite politics 
but we feel that hopefully the blackwhite political problem 
is reaching a resolution he said in an interview when blacks 
and whites are finally holding hands lets make sure its not in a 
desert 
the national party government in power since 1948 is viewed by 
many environmentalists as a halfhearted ally committed in 
principal to environmental protection but often reluctant to act 
possibly because industrial growth is needed to provide jobs for 
the fastgrowing black population 
peter glavovic an environmental law expert at the university of 
natal says the government has steered away from tough 
antipollution laws instead giving its environment minister broad 
discretionary powers 
south africa is in many respects still a developing country 
glavovic said the government clearly doesnt want to 
overregulate or curtail operations so that this starts impacting on 
economic growth 
the environment is the topic of a new book by clem sunter a 
corporate consultant who specializes in forecasting what lies ahead 
for south africa 
the book south african environments into the 21st century 
says droughts floods locust plagues sandstorms and fires in 
south africa during the 1980s were aggravated by shoddy 
conservation practices 
south africa had to pay the price for over a century of 
careless environmental management and its unique experiment in 
social engineering apartheid sunter writes 
he argues that the environment will be saved only through a 
combination of sustained economic growth curtailment of the birth 
rate and political stability 
people must be educated about the importance of safeguarding 
the interests of future generations by protecting the environment 
today he writes wiping the slate clean of apartheid is one 
thing but what replaces it is even more important

whatever the odds on manuel noriegas lease on 
power in panama they have to be heavily against the kind of tidy 
tieddown coup the administration seems to envision as a way to get 
rid of him 
after the coup that failed congress sounds more willing than 
the administration to take risks or at least to encourage 
president bush to take them provided they pay off in the ouster 
of the panamanian military boss 
but stripping a strongman of his power is a risky enterprise 
with no guarantees it does not lend itself to scripts written in 
washington for execution without peril to american forces and 
interests 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the administration 
would want better conditions and a better atmosphere in order to 
commit american forces to a future move against noriega 
baker said the message sent to us commanders at the time of 
the oct 3 coup attempt was to go ahead with support if there 
were an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and 
significant loss of american life and to do so without open 
military involvement 
in congressional debate about what went wrong and whos to blame 
there has little talk about the risks involved in promoting or 
aiding an attempt to topple noriega by force and then arrest him 
on two us drug trafficking indictments 
noriega has withstood 2 years of us efforts under two 
administrations to push him out with economic and diplomatic 
sanctions an earlier coup attempt was crushed as was the attempt 
of a panamanian president to dismiss him he cancelled the results 
of an election after it had been held because it was going against 
him sanctions were stiffened and reinforcements sent to the 
12000man us garrison in panama the organization of american 
states tried to negotiate the peaceful transfer of power to a 
democratic government without success 
so much for persuasion that leaves force 
intervention in support of the coup attempted by dissident 
members of the panama defense forces could have led to us 
casualties baker argues that american lives should not be put at 
risk on the basis of somebody elses plan and somebody elses 
schedule 
then again a coup attempt based on a us plan and timetable 
would have builtin liabilities noriega already claims his 
opponents are yankee lackeys bent on helping the united states hold 
onto the panama canal open intervention would stir trouble 
elsewhere in latin america and could strengthen opponents of us 
bases elsewhere 
although the white house is reviewing the way it is set up to 
gather information and make decisions in times of crisis bushs 
spokesman said that is because of concern about the process not 
because of second thoughts about using us forces in support of 
the coup attempt 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said baloney to the 
suggestion that bush didnt get the information he needed on which 
to base a decision 
he made the decision he thought was best and the decision we 
still think is right fitzwater said tuesday 
nor he said is there any change in the administrations policy 
of encouraging the panamanians to oust noriega despite the critics 
who say that carried with it some obligation to help rebellious 
officers who tried to do the job 
bush has suggested repeatedly that the panama defense forces get 
rid of the general saying the united states has no quarrel with 
the organization only with noriega and his cadre he repeated that 
message the day after the aborted coup 
and well continue to speak out in that area fitzwater said 
administration officials have been doing so 
john h sununu the white house chief of staff said in a 
saturday interview on cable news network that he thinks noriega 
will be ousted within six months if you want odds id say 8 to 
5 that he probably will be out sununu said 
baker wasnt quoting odds but he said the pressure will stay 
on and were not going to rule out the use of force either 
force that we ourselves plan totally and directly or force in 
conjunction with some other operation baker said sunday on nbcs 
meet the press 
administration spokesmen fanned out to the network talk shows as 
bush was criticized from both the right and the left for failing to 
order us military action in support of the coup 
the senate approved a measure expressing support for efforts by 
the president to use the full range of appropriate diplomatic 
economic and military options to protect americans guard the 
canal remove noriega and restore constitutional government 
republicans complained that some democrats who had opposed 
intervention in other crises were retroactively endorsing it in the 
panama coup 
failure is the father of about a hundred hawks on capitol hill 
now said sen william s cohen rmaine

time is money 
though that proverb dates to ancient history repeated over the 
centuries by sages like benjamin franklin and charles dickens it 
is by no means worn out 
in fact in an era of twoincome families convenience stores 
fax machines and microwave ovens it has taken on new relevance as 
one of the most common and important principles people apply to 
the business of their daily lives 
a service economy like that of the united states today 
provides more and more situations in which you can or must 
exchange one of those valued commodities for the other 
so the questions naturally arise how much is your time worth in 
dollars and by no means incidentally how much are your dollars 
worth in time 
for most people who work for wages or salaries one quick answer 
to that question is available from the stub on your last paycheck 
5 an hour or 10 or 50 or 500 perhaps overtime gets you 
timeandahalf or 50 percent more 
similarly anyone with a handheld calculator can estimate the 
time value of his or her money if you invest 3650 at a 10 
percent yield in a oneyear certificate of deposit the bank pays 
you about about 1 a day for the use of your money 
but the reckoning gets more complicated once you start to deal 
with problems involving more variables that are harder to quantify 
for example what is the net income your household realizes from 
a second job that requires extra expenses for day care 
transportation and convenience foods how much return per hour do 
you actually get from clipping and filing supermarket coupons 
and how high must the hourly labor rate charged by a plumber or 
electrician go before it behooves you to take on the labors and 
risks of home repairs yourself 
often of course necessity makes the decision for you if you 
lack the money you find the time somehow if an urgent mission is 
beyond your time and skills you endeavor to scrape up the money 
somewhere 
still even in cases like these there can be tradeoffs 
involved suppose you have a household problem for which you must 
hire a contractor 
by the traditional wisdom notes john t reed in his newsletter 
real estate investors monthly you should get estimates from at 
least three contractors before you hire one for the job to get the 
best possible price you might even call in every contractor in 
your area 
the more exhaustive your selection process though the more 
time you are likely to spend trying to save money 
cases like this give you an opportunity to perform an 
instructive exercise if you keep track of the money saved and the 
time spent on a given project you can simply divide the dollar 
amount of savings by the number of hours you put in 
the result of that onestep calculation gives you the value in 
dollars per hour you have set for yourself on your time 
conversely if you pay someone else to tackle something you 
might have done yourself you can divide the extra expense by your 
estimate of how many hours of work you saved that tells you how 
much money you are willing to spend in exchange for an hour of your 
time

if you examine an economist carefully you 
generally will find an individual who believes inflation is one of 
the great threats to mankind not just to mans economy but to 
his existence 
they have good reasons for the feeling because inflation not 
only corrupts the currency but eventually erodes quality morality 
ambition contracts values and responsibilities at individual 
group and governmental levels 
still not all economists put inflation at the top of their 
lists of things to avoid there is another group that says constant 
worry and maneuvering to avoid inflation can produce equal or worse 
consequences 
those two groups are now fighting it out and it could be a 
slugfest in one group is a white house that sees economic growth 
as a more important goal than inflation fighting in the other is 
the federal reserve 
they arent likely to identify themselves as opponents because 
conflict tends to cause too much excitement in the marketplace but 
the scrap will be hard to disguise these are two heavyweights 
alan greenspan chairman of the fed had made clear his position 
that inflation is the bigger threat and his actions suggest that 
he is even willing to incur a mild recession in order to keep it 
submerged 
greenspan hasnt just recently joined the antiinflation group 
back in the mid1970s he chaired an antiinflation commission for 
president ford that campaigned on the win ticket whip inflation 
now 
critics forgive him for that because doubledigit inflation was 
a scourge of the 1970s rising to doubledigit levels that while 
making some people rich disrupted markets threatened banking 
stability and destroyed savings 
greenspans timing was less forgivable since the win campaign 
was launched while the nations economy was about to plunge into a 
recession which for limited practical purposes can be called the 
opposite of inflation 
ever since becoming federal reserve chairman in the reagan 
administration greenspan has continued to signal his fear of 
inflation while many economists celebrated inflation of less than 
5 percent greenspan said it wasnt enough 
in july 1988 when some economists were discussing the economys 
slow growth greenspan told the senate banking committee that 
unemployment was nearing its lower limit and industrial capacity 
its upper limit 
when those limits are reached a true inflation fighter knows 
that interest rates must be raised greenspan saw to it and over 
the next four months the federal funds rate increased a full 
percentage point to 85 percent 
whether greenspan saved the economy from inflation will be 
debated forever more important was the perception that he viewed 
the economy as too hot when some of his brother economists thought 
it was somewhat cool 
rather than raising interest rates some of these colleagues 
argued shouldnt the country seek to expand its capacity expanded 
capacity new equipment and more efficient plants also could remove 
an inflation threat 
edward yardeni prudentialbache economics director expressed 
the latter view late in 1988 if greenspan tightened too much he 
said he could abort the capital spending needed to expand 
capacity he fears there isnt enough of 
this week greenspan seemed to issue another warning advising 
people not to expect easier money in the interest of expanding the 
economy he said in effect that the bigger threat is still 
inflation rather than recession

the rev lester meyer remembers the phone call he received one 
saturday from another pastor wondering when meyer and his family 
were going to move out so he could move in 
the other minister was embarrassed to learn meyer had no idea he 
had been transferred but a generation ago it was not unusual for 
the bishop to order a pastor to pull up stakes within a few days 
and move to another outpost in the united methodist church 
now a member of the hierarchy himself meyer finds the 
centuriesold tradition of the itineracy in which ministers are 
guaranteed jobs for life in return for going where they are sent 
under challenge from clergy who no longer can or want to uproot 
their families to serve a small rural church or a poor urban 
church 
formally they still take the same vow practically speaking 
there is a different philosophy said meyer district 
superintendent of the oklahoma city north district part of the 
united methodists oklahoma conference the autocratic assignment 
process simply would not work in the present social times 
the 9 millionmember church that once operated on the principle 
that a pastor always has a church a church always has a pastor 
has had to adjust to the advent of clergy couples and working 
spouses and to theological changes stressing the partnership of 
bishops and clergy 
the future of the itineracy is being weighed by a commission for 
the study of ministry it began work in 1984 and expects to produce 
a preliminary report early next year the final report is to be 
presented before the 1992 general conference the churchs chief 
policymaking body 
the issue is not unique to the united methodist church 
in the roman catholic church bishops have been consulting more 
frequently with priests and parishes on clergy assignments in the 
last 20 years said the rev david brinkmoeller executive director 
of the secretariat for priestly life and ministry of the national 
conference of catholic bishops 
its a theological conviction that everyone has some 
understanding of gods will not just the bishops brinkmoeller 
said 
united methodist bishop bruce blake of dallas vicechairman of 
the commission on ministry said the hierarchical ministry is being 
phased out in many churches 
i think what is happening in the itineracy is sort of symbolic 
of whats happening in the church in general blake said 
collegiality throughout the church is replacing hierarchy and 
competition 
in addition pastors and their families have more at stake today 
when considering a move 
the ordination of women for example has produced the 
corresponding phenomenon of clergy couples there are about 600 
clergy couples among the more than 38000 ordained ministers in the 
united methodist church 
the rise in twoincome families also has decreased mobility as 
spouses veto moves too far from present jobs meyer estimates 80 
percent of the clergy in his area have working spouses 
but brinkmoeller says the rub in the system of greater 
consultation on personnel moves is that few changes are currently 
possible jobs in inner cities and remote areas still must be 
filled 
some episcopal bishops in a recent excellence in ministry 
report for the church commented sardonically that there was no 
job shortage in some of the less attractive jobs in remote areas 
and the inner cities 
some within the united methodist church are concerned that 
giving clergy veto power over jobs would make it more difficult to 
fill less attractive positions while the large welloff churches 
could shop around for the best and the brightest clergy nearly 
twothirds of united methodist congregations have fewer than 200 
members 
what happens in practice meyer said is that lesser 
qualified clergy are sometimes appointed to rural churches 
blake said there is a tension within clergy between their call 
to be in ministry and careerism which he defined as a gross 
national product understanding of vocation that equates bigger 
with better 
in britain methodists have dealt with the issue by 
standardizing clergy salaries proposals to do the same in the 
united states have consistently been defeated but blake said the 
issue will not go away 
that is on the table we must resolve it blake said if 
the guiding principle of ones ministry is ones career that is 
not theologically or ecclessiastically defensible

the food and drug administration says it will 
evaluate heatsensitive food packaging materials designed for 
microwave cooking to determine whether new safety regulations are 
needed 
the fda is asking for information about heat susceptors 
metalized surfaces in the packages of food intended for microwave 
cooking these heat susceptors absorb microwave energy and become 
very hot allowing the food to become brown and crisp 
because the susceptors become so hot the fda said tuesday it is 
concerned that other parts of the package including adhesives 
polymers paper and components of plastic films may migrate into 
the food at high levels 
the fda has regulations governing the safety of packaging 
materials that contain substances that could migrate into food but 
the agency said that at the time many of the rules were written 
these materials were not commonly used at temperatures above 300 
degrees fahrenheit 
heatsusceptor packaging can raise the temperature to more than 
500 degrees fahrenheit 
the fda said it does not have enough data to determine whether 
at these high temperatures the packaging materials are safe it is 
asking the industry and the scientific community to submit 
information the agency can use to consider amending the regulations 
for food packaging

integrated resources inc a struggling 
financial concern was dealt another blow when whitehall financial 
group said it could not obtain financing to buy integrateds core 
financial services businesses 
integrated also said tuesday that whitehall was seeking a 
significant adjustment in the 310 million purchase price and 
proposed to pay for the business partly with securities in the new 
core group 
the snag raises further doubts about integrateds ability to 
make payments on some 175 billion in debt integrated has not 
paid any principle or interest to bondholders since june when it 
said it would have to default because of worsening troubles 
stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real estate 
into financial services businesses 
whitehall a familyowned partnership had reached a tentative 
agreement in august to buy integrated resources life insurance co 
integrated resources equity corp integrated resources asset 
management corp resources trust co and financial clearing and 
services corp 
after the spinoff of subsidiaries integrateds main business 
would be management of existing public and private limited 
partnerships and real estate investment trusts 
integrated once a highflying real estate investment concern 
said it was continuing negotiations with whitehall and is also 
engaged in serious discussions with another party 
integrated said it still wants to reach an agreement to sell the 
core businesses by sunday 
integrated had said it would try to sell its core financial 
service companies for 450 million to 525 million but whitehall 
was interested in only part of the holdings the 310 million price 
was put at 20 million to 30 million below the low end of the 
desired price for the financial businesses 
integrated also said it had agreed to pay whitehall a 4 million 
breakup fee of the deal was dropped 
whitehall is halfowned by members of the de gunzburg branch of 
the bronfman family of canada heirs to the seagram ltd distilling 
fortune and halfowned by the moross family of london which has 
extensive financial services interests whitehall has holdings in 
life insurance and property and casualty brokerage 
under the deal whitehall would not buy integrateds capitol

britain suddenly has found itself in an economic 
crisis with high inflation high interest rates and a growing 
trade deficit returning despite the 10year thatcher revolution 
a recent move by the government to hike interest rates to 15 
percent the highest level in eight years might plunge britain 
into a recession the governments critics warn 
the pound is falling sharply despite the interest rate increase 
and stock prices are sinking on the prospect of yet another rate 
hike 
theres no doubt about it we are in a crisis said simon 
knapp a british economist at the london investment firm barclays 
de zoete wedd ltd youre talking about the possibility of the 
uk going into a recession that hasnt happened since 19811982 
said david webb a lecturer on economics at the london school of 
economics it is quite a serious problem the economy is going to 
have to take some pretty harsh medicine over the next few months 
among the victims are homeowners who have seen mortgage 
payments rise steadily through 11 official interest rate hikes over 
the past 17 months 
the government insists the problems arise from success not 
failure that the inflation now running at an annual rate of 73 
percent stems from an economy that grew too fast in the boom years 
of thatcherism 
it points out that inflation and interest rates are still below 
those it inherited when margaret thatcher took office as prime 
minister in 1979 
but the crisis has put mrs thatchers conservative party on the 
defense in the midst of its annual convention this week an agenda 
that was supposed to dwell on the triumphs of thatcherism is now 
likely to be dominated by the economic problems 
meanwhile the opposition labor party is looking like a credible 
alternative for the first time in years its ahead in the polls 
has formally dumped many of its old votelosing policies and is 
looking with increasing confidence toward mid1992 the deadline 
for britains next general election 
despite the current troubles the thatcher government maintains 
that fighting inflation is its priority and high interest rates 
the weapon no matter how unpopular 
mrs thatcher told party members at a preconference dinner 
monday night the economy is stronger than ever the interest rate 
rise was necessary and this government always does what is 
necessary and always has 
just months ago the government was credited with curing 
britains longterm economic disease of high inflation and high 
interest rates 
it boasted of the longest period of economic growth since world 
war ii fiscal prudence and a longdeclining unemployment rate 
now at 61 percent nigel lawson who slashed income tax rates was 
being hailed as one of britains greatestever chancellors of the 
exchequer the governments chief fiscal officer 
so what went wrong 
basically the chancellor let the economy grow too strongly 
for too long knapp said 
lawson fearful of recession allowed interest rates to stay too 
low after the october 1987 stock market crash the economist said 
instead consumer spending and investment already strong grew 
further spurring inflation the economist said 
britains industry warns that its profits jobs and 
competitiveness abroad are in danger 
weak sterling can be inflationary and the government has 
defended the pound through higher interest rates and central bank 
intervention 
but the pound has continued to fall dropping below the key 
psychological barrier of 3 west german marks on monday that could 
mean yet another hike in interest rates 
late tuesday the pound was down 3 pfennigs and two cents from 
monday at 295 marks and 15580 
the stock market has declined sharply on the prospect of higher 
interest rates the financial times100 share index closed at 
22188 tuesday down 4 percent from last wednesday the day before 
the most recent interest rate hike 
the latest troubles began sept 26 when the pound was hit by 
the announcement of a 3 billion current account deficit for 
august its third worst on record the trade measure is expected to 
more than double to 24 billion this year

mccaw cellular communications inc has boosted 
its pershare offer for lin broadcasting corp but said it would be 
happy with simple control of the cellularphone company rather than 
an outright purchase 
the announcement tuesday was the latest twist in a takeover 
attempt that began in early june 
mccaw based in the seattle suburb of kirkland said it would 
pay 125 a share in cash for 22 million of lins approximately 54 
million outstanding shares or a total of 275 billion 
in june mccaw offered 120 a share for the 90 percent of lin 
stock it does not already own then lowered its bid in july to 110 
a share after a court ruling it said lowered the value of new 
yorkbased lin 
but analysts predicted that under terms of the new offer mccaw 
would still wind up with full ownership of lin in five years 
combined with nearly 51 million lin shares it already owns the 
latest offer would immediately give mccaw the nations largest 
cellular phone operator slightly more than 50 percent of lin 
and tuesdays bid said mccaw would guarantee lins remaining 
shares would be exchanged in five years for a price to be 
determined by the lin board and the companys investment bankers 
or that the entire company would be sold at that time at auction 
analysts said that provision almost certainly means mccaw would 
achieve full ownership of lin at that time 
well be reviewing it mccaws new offer and making a public 
statement at some future date said mike plouf lins vice 
president of corporate development and treasurer beyond that he 
said the company had no comment 
the deal values all of lin which owns seven television 
stations cellular telephone properties and a small publishing 
operation at about 675 billion 
this is almost back to where they were before in the june 
offer so from a valuation standpoint its virtually unchanged 
about 290 per pop said geoffrey johnson a 
telecommunications analyst for argus research corp 
a pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a 
marketarea population by the percentage ownership of cellular 
systems serving the market 
really what theyre doing is appeasing institutional 
investors who dont want to give up lin johnson said 
trouble financing a full takeover might also have prompted the 
decision to tone down the offer said alfred humphries director of 
research and a cellular analyst for the denver investment firm 
hanifen imhoff inc who noted an offer for the whole company 
would involve about 6 billion in debt 
mccaw said in a statement it anticipated no trouble raising the 
needed capital without a public debt offering although it said 
drexel burnham lambert inc its investment backer was highly 
confident if could raise 25 billion with an offering if needed 
we are determined to complete the acquisition of lin in order 
to provide a vital link in the creation of a seamless nationwide 
cellular network said craig o mccaw the companys chairman and 
chief executive officer 
mccaw has been repeatedly rejected by lin 
the companies said in july they were talking about a merger 
agreement at 12750 a share but they could not agree on the 
timing of the deal and the talks broke off 
last month lin announced it intended to merge with the domestic 
cellular telephone interests of bellsouth corp the regional 
telephone company in atanta 
tuesdays move by mccaw left analysts speculating about 
bellsouths response its offer was valued at about 105 per share 
only 20 of which was cash 
its hard to say what a logical reply for them would be 
humphries said they could put more cash into the pot and thereby 
raise the dividend payment they could try a number of devices but 
theres not an easy way 
last week mccaw said it was buying a halfinterest in metro 
one a cellular franchise in new york city whose other half is 
owned by lin mccaw said it was paying 19 billion for the 
interest which is now owned by metromedia co 
lin has a 45day right to match the mccaw offer for the metro 
one stake 
mccaw said tuesday that after the completion of its tender offer 
for lins shares it would sell its interest in metro one to lin 
mccaw also said last week it would sell its interests in 13 
mobiletelephone franchises in alabama kentucky and tennessee to 
contel cellular inc for 13 billion cash that could be used in 
the bids for lin and metro one

members of the air line pilots association gave 
striking eastern airlines pilots a bracing morale boost by voting 
to continue special payments to the eastern strikers 
alpa which represents pilots at nearly all the nations major 
carriers announced late tuesday that a majority of its members 
voted to maintain the strike benefits for eastern pilots alpa 
declined to reveal the vote tally saying only that a simple 
majority of the returned ballots was needed to continue the 
payments for six months 
the announcement gave a lift to the 2400 or so eastern pilots 
in their eighth month of a walkout after numerous setbacks in 
their fight against frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
texas air corp pilot leaders had warned that if alpa abandoned the 
eastern pilots the national unions bargaining position with all 
the carriers would have been weakened 
when the strike against miamibased eastern began march 4 there 
were about 3600 pilots at the airline their ranks have thinned 
since as financial pressures have forced scores back across the 
picket lines and others have retired or found jobs at other 
carriers 
ron cole a spokesman for the striking pilots said the alpa 
vote will bolster people still on the picket lines 
it wasnt unexpected because professional pilots understand 
that the outcome of the eastern strike will have a direct bearing 
on their own futures he said i think it gives them a show of 
support from their fellow pilots and will help continue their 
strong resolve 
the 40000 or so alpa members were asked to vote last month on 
whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their salary 
to their colleagues at eastern which is trying to emerge from 
bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier alpa declined to say 
how many pilots voted 
the benefits to eastern pilots averaged about 2400 a month per 
flier since the walkout began 
the pilots were a crucial element of support in the strike that 
started with easterns machinists union which also was joined by 
the airlines flight attendants 
its a tremendous morale boost eastern machinists leader 
charles bryan said in a telephone interview from miami it will 
certainly give our people a boost to know that alpa supports their 
strike that strongly 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the airline had no 
comment on the matter 
later this week the senate could vote on a bill supported by 
the eastern unions to set up a blueribbon commission that would 
investigate the eastern dispute in a vote last week the senate 
decided to cut off debate on the bill 
but the white house and the transportation department have 
lobbied heavily against the bill and president bush is likely to 
veto it in that case if congress couldnt muster the votes to 
override his veto the pilots could suffer a blow to morale

procter amp gamble co one of the nations 
largest consumer products companies will head into the 1990s 
looking to increase its overseas sales under a new top executive 
the cincinnatibased company will get a new chairman and chief 
executive officer jan 2 when edwin l artzt takes over for john g 
smale the companys leader for the last nine years 
smale 62 surprised shareholders at their annual meeting 
tuesday by announcing he will stepping down to spend more time with 
his family that set in motion of series of toplevel shifts that 
will leave artzt head of the diversified company which had more 
than 21 billion in worldwide sales last year 
artzt 59 has been vice chairman of the board and president of 
procter amp gamble international since 1984 his first major 
promotion came in 1969 when he was named vice president of the 
food products division 
in another move company president john e pepper will give up 
most of his responsibilities for pampgs domestic operations to 
oversee the international business 
during his tenure smale helped the company branch out into 
foreign markets roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal 
year came from outside the united states and smale said the figure 
should top 50 percent in a few years 
procter amp gamble is well along the way towards changing from 
being a united statesbased business that sells some of its 
products in international markets to being a truly world company 
smale said 
smale also led the company into new product lines and oversaw an 
805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining 
management under his leadership the company acquired 
richardsonvicks the noxell corp and some major brands from gd 
searle those moves gave the company a wide base in 
overthecounter drugs and beauty products 
pampg had sales of 214 billion in the fiscal year ended june 30 
earnings of 16 billion and dividends of 3 per common share all 
company records 
smale cited personal reasons for deciding to give up his 
executive position jan 2 he said he will remain an employee and 
will serve as a director and as chairman of the boards executive 
committee 
by january i will have been president and then chairman of 
procter amp gamble for nearly 16 years he said i will have been 
the chief executive officer of the company for nine years ive 
reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family its 
time to turn this responsibility over to someone else 
in other personnel moves pampg announced that 
b jurgen hintz a group vice president was elected an 
executive vice president he will be responsible for the companys 
domestic paper products cellulose and chemicals and food and 
beverage businesses 
durk i jager a group vice president was chosen an executive 
vice president he will be responsible for domestic soap detergent 
and health and beauty care businesses 
gerald v dirvin senior vice president becomes an executive 
vice president he will continue to oversee most of pampgs staff 
functions such as sales advertising marketing services and 
public affairs 
smale announced the sweeping changes at a shareholders meeting 
punctuated by an animalrights demonstration several dozen 
activists picketed outside the companys headquarters while others 
questioned smale during the meeting about pampgs continued use of 
animals for productsafety testing 
smale repeated the companys position that marketing certain 
products without animal testing would be unsafe 
animal tests are used only when no other acceptable methods 
are available he said 
animalrights activists who have targeted pampg in recent years 
have failed to gain approval at recent shareholder meetings for 
proposals to stop the use of animals in product testing 
smale declined to say how many animals are being used for such 
purposes he did say the company reduced the number of animals it 
uses by onethird in the past five years and will continue to look 
for alternatives 
in other matters shareholders approved a 2for1 stock split 
effective oct 20 and increased the authorized number of common 
shares from 500 million to 1 billion

alan greenspan the chairman of the us federal 
reserve board says soviet economists appear largely unfettered by 
ideology as they search for ways out of the countrys financial 
woes 
in a meeting tuesday that would have been unthinkable just a few 
years ago greenspan held discussions with nine of the top economic 
minds of a system that has been at the opposite end of the 
philosophical spectrum for decades 
he told a news conference the soviets are willing to reach 
beyond the usual confines of what economic policymakers are 
willing to do 
they are broadening their view to see whether there are 
applicable views outside their immediate circle greenspan said 
did we get into an ideological debate over values no he 
said 
greenspan said he was not able to offer specific suggestions to 
many soviet economic problems because of his lack of detailed 
knowledge of its system but he did discuss such issues as reform 
and convertibility of the soviet ruble 
the decades of ideological differences resulted in an initial 
sense of akwardness if i didnt feel odd i must say i would be 
peculiar greenspan said but the soviets nonideological 
approach dissipated the sense of uncertainty he said 
greenspan who was chairman of the presidents council of 
economic advisers under president gerald ford and also headed a 
commission on social security reform met with finance minister 
valentin pavlov deputy premier leonid abalkin and other top 
officials and economic theorists 
those officials are trying to right an economy struggling with a 
huge budget deficit bare store shelves increasing consumer fears 
of even worse conditions strikes and a nearworthless currency 
despite their troubles greenspan said there is no sense of 
crisis among the soviet economists 
in their meetings greenspan said the soviets sought information 
on the western approach to solving individual economic problems 
but they will not try to superimpose capitalism on their own 
system he said 
the nited states can help by providing economic expertise on 
particular issues but discussion of us economic aid as some 
soviet officials have suggested was not on the agenda he said 
what they have basically is an understanding that they have to 
restructure and that the issue of success is theirs greenspan 
said 
greenspan also turned his attention to exchange rates in the 
world market in a speech for delivery later to us and soviet 
officials at the us ambassadors residence in moscow 
in an advanced text released in washington greenspan said that 
attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to 
destabilizing international capital flows and ultimately have to 
be abandoned 
he said that paying inordinate attention to intermediate targets 
in setting monetary policy may not promote the attainment of 
longterm goals 
greenspan made his remarks as the federal reserve board finds 
itself under pressure from the bush administration to take action 
to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against foreign 
currencies this year 
the fed also is being urged by some administration officials to 
ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of recession

nine major companies say they are forming a 
clearinghouse to promote cooperation among themselves and others in 
ending use of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs as cleaning agents 
some of the companies who made the announcement tuesday had made 
clear previously their intention of seeking substitutes for cfcs 
cfcs are used widely as refrigeration fluids in air conditioners 
and refrigerators as well in as cleaning solvents for metals and 
electronic components they escape into the atmosphere where they 
damage the highaltitude ozone shield that protects the earth from 
the suns ultraviolet radiation 
the united states and 44 other countries have agreed to phase 
out the production of cfcs with hopes of eliminating them 
altogether by the turn of the century 
the companies participating in the announcement tuesday were 
atampt boeing digital equipment ford motor general electric 
honeywell motorola northern telecom and texas instruments 
the organization called the industry cooperative for ozone 
layer protection will act as a clearinghouse for information on 
new substitute solvents encourage the prompt adoption of safe 
substitutes and work with producers and the government to 
distribute information about substitutes to developing countries

federal regulators say they will try to sell 
the federal asset disposition association a quasiprivate company 
created to manage and sell sour loans and real estate from failed 
savings institutions 
fada in structure is a private financial institution but it is 
wholly owned by the federal government 
until early last year it was under intense congressional 
scrutiny after critics complained that fada had grown into a 
bloated inefficient bureaucracy mired in political favortism and 
insider dealing 
the resolution trust corp a 2monthold government agency 
created to handle failed sampls said tuesday it will accept bids 
until oct 31 for a sale to settle no later than nov 30 
if no bids are acceptable fada will be taken over by the 
government and its 275 employees offered government jobs working 
for the rtc 
fada manages about 3 billion in real estate and loans from 
failed thrifts having disposed of 13 billion in the four years 
since it was created 
fadas purchaser will acquire offices in washington los 
angeles atlanta denver and dallas a computer system office 
furnishings and not much else 
the sale will not include the agencys name stock charter as a 
financial institution cash or the right to retain government 
management contracts 
john wills president of fada said his organization offers 
buyers a core of real estate experts ready to participate in a 
flood of work as the government attempts to resolve the sampl mess 
including the sale of an estimated 100 billion in hardtosell 
real estate and bad loans 
if you intend to get into the asset management business its 
one way to way get the largest group of professionals that have 
expertise in managing these troubled assets coming out of the 
thrift industry he said 
wills acknowledged past criticism but said every single rock 
in fada was turned over and examined if anything because of the 
intense scrutiny we came out of it much more sound than any 
comparable organization 
wills said about 40 companies have expressed varying degrees of 
interest in fada but industry officials believe the core of 
serious buyers is much smaller 
the successful bidder would have three alternatives seek 
management contracts from the rtc compete to buy property outright 
from the rtc or offer its management services to financial 
institutions and others that end up owning the sampl property wills 
said 
je robert cos an alexandria va company specializing in 
the management of distressed real estate is among the 
organizations considering making an offer for fada according to 
company chairman joseph e robert jr 
you might look at it as paying a headhunter fee to acquire the 
services of 275 employees he said fada will be of interest 
to people already heavily engaged in this business who have a 
confident feeling theyll be successful in expanding otherwise 
fada becomes a very expensive enterprise 
among other possible bidders according to industry sources are 
ncnb texas a dallasbased company that has already purchased the 
deposits of several failed thrifts

the united states will file a fairtrade 
complaint against the european community over a nonbinding quota 
system designed to limit imported tv programs to no more than half 
of all shows aired says us trade representative carla hills 
hills who previously said the united states would fight any 
local content rules the european community implements for 
television as part of its plan to remove trade barriers between its 
member nations by 1992 said tuesday she was deeply disturbed 
by the oct 3 decision on tv 
although the television without frontiers directive was not 
binding on member nations hills said it was blatantly 
protectionist and unjustifiable and discriminates against us and 
other nonec film goods 
in brussels belgium house majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and other members of congress held what gephardt called a 
spirited exchange with european community officials about the 
new tv measure 
we feel very strongly about this issue said gephardt 
its especially troubling for americans to see a product that we 
do have some skill in and some advantage to be closed down to 
any extent 
hills said she will take immediate action to address that 
decision under the 96nation freetrade accord known as the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the united states government believes that the local content 
requirement in the broadcast directive is inconsistent with the 
communitys obligation not to discriminate against foreign products 
to give equal treatment under the gatt i am initiating prompt 
action in that forum hills said in a prepared statement 
gatt has no police power over its member nations but hills 
action indicates the bush administration is having second thoughts 
about the european communitys 1992 program 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher last week told a house 
foreign affairs subcommittee that the united states may have to 
reassess its position if the european community continues towards 
local content rules in areas such as television computer chips 
telecommunications equipment and automobiles 
according to industry figures the united states realizes a 3 
billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and tv 
exports and europe is the leading market for such programs with 
about 700 million in purchases yearly 
tv series such as miami vice and dallas are enormously 
popular in europe which has caused legislators there to decry the 
americanization of their populaces 
officials estimate that out of 125000 hours of tv shown in 
western europe annually only 20000 hours are produced in europe 
japan australia and the united states provide the remainder 
france had urged mandatory quotas be placed on tv programming 
but the ec declined to do so 
hills said the cultural argument was a smokescreen for economic 
protectionism 
we do not understand why the spanish culture is more protected 
by a film produced in germany by europeans than by a spanish film 
of mexican origin or why the english culture is promoted more by a 
film produced in france by europeans than by a film of new 
zealand origin the definition of european works is economic 
not cultural she said 
she added that us concerns were further heightened by press 
reports that the ec is pledging hundreds of millions of additional 
dollars in subsidies to european producers and writers

if he succeeds with his bold 7 billion buyout 
bid for amr corp developer donald trump pledges to keep the 
parent of american airlines at its headquarters in fort worth 
texas 
i have absolutely no intention of moving american from the 
dallasfort worth area trump said tuesday in a telephone 
interview from his new york office 
trump who said he knows and likes the dallasfort worth area 
appeared to make the statement to reassure amr employees the head 
of americans secondlargest union the 16000member association 
of professional flight attendants recently met with advisers to 
discuss possible ways to help management fend off trumps bid 
amr has had little to say about trumps offer beyond its initial 
response that the bid would be considered in due course 
although the company said it preferred to remain independent 
trumps 120ashare cash offer for the nations largest and 
most profitable airline has been met with suspicion by many in the 
financial community who see it as a ploy to drive up the price of 
amr stock and enhance trumps own holdings 
amr tumbled 3375 a share to 101375 tuesday in active trading 
on the new york stock exchange apparently reflecting investor 
skepticism about trumps offer 
a major institutional investor said tuesday it had joined the 
list of trump doubters 
since thursday when trumps offer was made public windsor fund 
sold its 425000 shares to take advantage of the increase stock 
price said john b neff who has managed the fund for 25 years 
i have a hard time taking mr trump seriously 120s a very 
full price and i dont know where the financing is going to come 
from neff said this isnt loose change 
but the real estate tycoon insists his intentions are real 
im very serious about it he said i think this is a company 
with great potential and i look forward to getting it 
trump declined to provide details of his financing plan 
although he said it involves relatively little leverage and no 
foreign investors two major areas of concern raised by the 
department of transportation regarding the current wave of airline 
buyouts 
trump told amr last week that he would put up 1 billion of 
equity in the deal and believes financing is readily available for 
the remainder 
the developer has a reputation as a good customer who has paid 
off debts and has warm relations with bankers his bluechip real 
estate and casino properties could be readily borrowed against 
while amrs assets also could be considered as collateral 
observers say

the dollar closed higher against the yen today 
despite the bank of japans discount rate increase and massive 
dollar selling and the tokyo stock exchanges key index plunged 
the dollar closed at 14390 yen up 167 yen from mondays close 
of 14223 yen it opened at 14490 yen and moved between 14255 yen 
and 14495 yen 
currency and stock markets were closed tuesday for a japanese 
holiday 
the dollars high opening followed overseas rallies overnight 
but it edged down in early trading amid rumors of an increase in 
the discount rate the charge for funds borrowed by banks from the 
central bank 
after the morning session the bank raised the rate by 05 
percentage point to 375 percent higher interest rates tend to 
make a countrys currency more attractive to investors pushing up 
its value 
the decision came in consideration of recent currency market 
fluctuations movements in foreign interest rates domestic 
economic trends consumer prices and the money supply bank of 
japan gov satoshi sumita told a news conference 
the dollar had climbed to a closing of 145 yen on sept 22 
before monetary officials of seven major industrialized nations 
decided on efforts to check its rise it dropped to 13930 yen on 
oct 2 but has been moving generally upward since 
the bank of japan hopes the rate hike will contribute to 
sustainable growth led by domestic demand while maintaining 
consumer price stability sumita said adding that the move was 
intended to stem inflation 
although west germany also had raised its official discount rate 
last week sumita said japans decision was reached independently 
toru kanai foreign currency analyst with new japan securities 
co ltd said the discount rate increase came out of the blue 
and many of us had expected the us discount rate cut to come 
first 
daiwa securities dealer kazuyuki suzuki added i never dreamed 
that the bank of japan would take such a step prior to reports of 
important economic indicators such as the us wholesale price 
index due out friday 
yoshitsugu hanada a senior trader with mitsui bank said the 
central bank also sold large amounts of dollars in the afternoon in 
an attempt to push the dollar down but the us currency still 
showed strength 
speculative investors were still inclined to buy the dollar 
because thats one of their few decent choices of investment 
considering the uptrend in domestic interest rates narrowing the 
gap with those overseas hanada said 
the nikkei stock exchange lost 13628 points or 039 percent 
closing at 3524007 it had gained 167 points monday 
the index plunged about 360 points after the discount rate 
increase was announced but recovered as some investors took 
advantage of lower prices to buy various issues suzuki said 
but the latest discount rate hike will certainly damage the 
stock market which no longer will grow as fast as it used to he 
added 
stock trading was moderate with first section volume estimated 
at 750 million shares up from mondays 700 million 
it was the second discount rate increase this year on may 30 
it was raised 075 percentage points to 325 percent

dow jones amp co inc says it intends to proceed 
with its 576 million tender offer for the 33 percent of telerate 
inc that it does not already own even though telerates directors 
found the offer inadeqaute 
we are proceeding with our 18 per share offer and continue to 
believe that the offer is fair to all telerate stockholders dow 
jones chairman warren h phillips said tuesday 
wall streeters evidently expect that dow jones will have to 
sweeten its bid however telerate rose 12 cents a share to close 
at 2037 on tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
telerate a provider of computerized financial information said 
a special panel of its directors urged shareholders not to tender 
their stock under terms of the dow jones offer and urged dow jones 
to arrange a meeting in order to achieve a mutually agreed upon 
transaction 
dow jones publisher of the wall street journal said it was 
disappointed by the panels assessment of its offer but indicated 
it has no plans to raise it or negotiate with the committee 
peter skinner dow jones vice president corporate counsel and 
secretary said dow jones has no plans to meet with the telerate 
special committee and no plans to raise its bid 
dow jones which also publishes barrons magazine community 
newspapers and electronic business information became involved 
with telerate in 1985 when it purchased a 32 percent stake in the 
company it subsequently increased its stake to 67 percent 
on sept 21 dow jones said it planned to offer 18 a share for 
the remaining telerate shares and began the tender offer five days 
later the offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire nov 
3 
skinner said dow jones investment bankers have since met with 
those of the telerate special committee to describe how it came to 
the pricing of its offer although not to negotiate any terms 
in its announcement tuesday telerate said that the special 
panel with concurrence of other telerate directors who are not 
employed by or consultants to dow jones found the 18 a share 
offer inadequate and not in the best interests of its 
stockholders 
telerates founder and chief executive neil s hirsch said he 
will not tender any of his shares which represent about 6 percent 
of the companys stock and that no other director or executive of 
telerate would tender under the current offer 
hirsch said the special committee had received clear 
indications from stockholders owning another 5 percent of 
telerates stock of their genuine dissatisfaction with the price 
dow jones is offering 
on monday telerate reported its thirdquarter earnings dropped 
174 percent compared with a year earlier and said it is in 
negotiations to buy the 50 percent stake that its partner american 
telephone amp telegraph co owns in the joint venture global 
transactions services co 
telerate and atampt began the venture in 1987 to develop an 
electronic service for foreignexchange transactions the service 
was recently launched

contract talks in the eightday walkout by boeing 
co machinists could resume within a week a key union leader says 
there have been no talks since some 57800 machinists left their 
jobs on oct 4 
federal mediator doug hammond has been in daily contact with 
both sides and will call for talks when he gets a signal a 
feeling that theres a reason to call the parties together said 
tom baker president of machinists district lodge 751 
i think that within a week well see that process starting 
baker said tuesday 
the last boeing strike was a 45day walkout by the machinists in 
1977 and two months is not really long for the aerospace 
industry baker said 
boeing on tuesday delivered the third jetliner it has completed 
since the walkout began it was a 747400 received by qantas 
airways ltd of australia 
the company said another three dozen or so might be completed by 
supervisors and machinists crossing picket lines 
meanwhile boeings secondlargest union the 27000person 
seattle professional engineering employees association voted to 
seek a 14 percent wage increase when its talks begin monday 
so far the machinists walkout has not strained relations with 
airlines and jet leasing companies despite worldwide pressure to 
replace aging aircraft with quieter more technologically advanced 
and fuelefficient models boeing spokesman harold carr said 
tuesday 
they understand its just one of those facts of doing 
business he said 
he said about three dozen aircraft were on the flight lines 
with almost all basic assembly completed each still requires 
exhaustive calibration of instruments testing and maybe a little 
touchup work normally done by the strikers carr said 
they go all the way from within days to two months or so 
away from delivery he said 
after five consecutive years of record orders boeing has a 
backlog stretching into the late 1990s 
in completing aircraft for delivery the initial concentration 
is on the flight lines carr said 
another 28 or 29 planes are in various stages of assembly on the 
737 and 757 lines in renton and the 747 and 767 lines in everett 
but they probably cannot be completed without major defections from 
union ranks carr said 
its unrealistic to think you can replace 43000 skilled 
people he said 
boeings offer spurned by machinists in an 85 percent strike 
vote oct 3 featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3 
percent raises in both 1990 and 1991 bonuses of 8 percent of 
workers gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990 a 
costofliving clause to virtually match inflation a reduction in 
mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits 
bakers local represents about 43300 boeing workers in seattle 
and its suburbs another 12000 or so work in wichita kan 1700 
in portland ore and a few hundred others at sites in several 
other states 
boeing earned 356 million on sales of 907 billion for the 
first half of 1989 and reported 614 million in profits on 1696 
billion in sales in 1988 
in a meeting monday night members of the engineers and 
technical workers group adopted as bargaining goals wage increases 
of 14 percent in the first year 9 percent in the second year 8 
percent in the first half of the third year and 4 percent in the 
second half of the final year plus quarterly costofliving 
adjustments and an unspecified lumpsum bonus 
engineers and technical workers bound by a nostrike clause in 
a contract expiring dec 1 have been crossing the machinists 
picket lines while refusing to do work normally done by the 
strikers 
the current threeyear contract boosted wages by 3 percent 2 
percent and 2 percent for engineers and 2 percent 2 percent and 3 
percent for technical workers engineers also got a onetime 9 
percent bonus and technical employees bonuses of 5 percent the 
first year and nearly 3 percent in each of the next two years

life for chrysler corp executive bennett bidwell 
would have been a lot easier if soichiro honda hadnt done what he 
had done 
bidwell speaking tuesday night at the annual automotive hall of 
fame dinner said competition among automakers in the 1990s will be 
tougher than ever and part of that is because of honda 
the 82yearold founder of honda motor co ltd was among four 
people inducted into the automotive hall of fame he is the first 
japanese national honored by the group that began in 1939 as the 
automobile old timers 
honda was a man without whom my life would have been a lot 
easier said bidwell chairman of chryslers manufacturing arm 
chrysler motors corp 
there has been speculation that if hondas us sales keep 
growing and if chryslers keep falling the japanese company could 
become the thirdlargest selling auto company in the united states 
earlier in the day honda brushed aside such speculation 
saying if we make progress so will chrysler so i dont think 
the difference between the two companies will become that much 
smaller 
but competition is high on the mind of bidwell and other auto 
executives 
there is conventional nuclear and thermonuclear warfare 
he said we are at stage three 
i said for five years it is a jungle out there it isnt 
anymore its worse 
he said that for a time chrysler had pretty much locked up the 
market on three segments minivans fourdoor sportutility 
vehicles and convertibles 
now they the market segments look like grand central 
station bidwell said there is a fight to the finish and in a 
fight to the finish the lowcost producer wins the highcost 
producer loses 
bidwell made only a passing remark about the companys effort to 
slash 1 billion out of its 26 billion budget by the end of next 
year included in that are the elimination of about 8 percent of 
the salaried work force or about 2300 jobs 
we will take suggestions about cost cutting about anything 
from anywhere he said 
hondas motorcycle company began making cars in 1963 it became 
the first japanese company to set up a manufacturing plant in the 
united states and later this year will open its second both along 
with an engine factory and a research facility are located in ohio 
our company in ohio has been so well accepted he said 
that i truly believe it is an american company 
inducted with honda were 
gordon buehrig the chief engineer of the dusenberg cord and 
auburn speedster automobiles 
frank kent a cadillac dealer in fort worth texas 
elmer wavering who installed the first radio in a car and went 
on to develop the first commercially successful car radio in 1930 
he later became associated with motorola inc

a persistent economy precision marketing and 
even some personal television appearances could help k mart corp 
out of its 1989 sales doldrums company chairman joseph antonini 
says 
antonini also outlined a 13billion expansion plan tuesday 
that would increase the number of k mart discount stores to 2500 
by 1995 from the current 2283 
the chairman told a news conference he is trying his new 
advertising approach in commercials being tested in the pueblo and 
colorado springs areas of colorado 
i can go on tv in front of the american public and tell them 
what we are doing he said adding that he will appear nationally 
in commercials on two k martproduced christmas specials 
one is christmas in america a movie starring kenny rogers 
the other is a program on christmas entertaining with author martha 
stewart who also lends her name to a line of k mart household 
products 
antonini said lowerthanexpected inflation and interest rates 
and betterthanexpected employment are raising his hopes for 
strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year 
were more optimistic than we were four months ago he said 
the fourth quarter is the last hope for a strong year k mart 
said last week that thirdquarter profits will be down from last 
year 
the fourth quarter also could get a boost as k mart opens 43 new 
stores and finishes the expansion of 63 others this fall antonini 
said 
beyond that time profit margins will improve as the company 
connects 2200 of its stores to its centralized inventory computer 
system by the end of next year for greater marketing precision 
antonini said 
we know what product sells in hoboken new jersey we know the 
price it sells for and we know how many sold on monday he said 
we never knew that before 
television advertising will be stepped up he said after buying 
about 24 weeks of national television advertising for this year 
the company will increase that to about 30 weeks next year and key 
some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars 
k mart predicted sagging thirdquarter earnings last week when 
it reported september sales of 26 billion that was up 61 
percent from september 1988 but up only 3 percent when comparing 
stores open for the full year 
the company reported earnings of 145 million down 109 
percent for its second fiscal quarter which ended july 26 
secondquarter sales of 7 billion were up 48 percent 
for the fiscal year beginning feb 1 sales reached 177 
billion through sept 27 up only 47 percent overall and a 
sluggish 12 percent on a comparable store basis 
k mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of 803 million on sales of 
273 billion

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly 
higher this morning on the chicago board of trade bouncing back 
from recent steep losses on buying inspired by technical factors 
and new export business 
soybean futures displayed the greatest strength in early trading 
after falling to 23month lows tuesday under heavy harvestrelated 
selling 
the markets have really gotten battered around lately and were 
oversold said joel karlin an analyst at research department 
inc in chicago 
some of the recent losses were linked to expectations that the 
agriculture department will increase its 1989 corn and soybean 
harvest estimates in a crop report due out after the close of 
trading on thursday 
but conrad leslie an influential private crop analyst based in 
chicago released prereport estimates late tuesday that fell below 
general market expectations prompting some buying this morningg 
additional support today stemmed from usda confirmation late 
tuesday that the soviet union purchased 150000 metric tons of us 
soybean meal 
in early trading wheat futures were cent lower to 1 cents 
higher with the contract for delivery in december at 406 a 
bushel corn futures were cent to 1 cents higher with december 
at 234 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with 
december at 141 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 6 cents 
higher with november at 556 a bushel 
livestock futures were narrowly mixed while pork bellies were 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 08 cent lower to 05 cent higher with october

nbc today show coanchor jane pauley says 
she probably will leave the program by the end of the year but will 
stay with the network in some fashion or other the washington 
post reported today 
neither she nor the network would comment on the report 
nbc news spokeswoman peggy hubble said a statement on pauleys 
future probably would be made later in the day ms pauley who has 
two years left on her nbc news contract didnt return calls and 
was reported by her office out taping an interview 
i am definitely staying at nbc the post quoted ms pauley 
as saying in a telephone interview from new york 
ms pauley has been coanchor of today for 13 years but her 
future with the program has been the subject of speculation in the 
weeks since deborah norville took over as newscaster on the program 
thirteen years ago today jane pauley began on today 
coanchor bryant gumbel said at the opening of this mornings 
broadcast thats a long time is that a lifetime 
its a long time its my whole adult life virtually ms 
pauley responded thank you 
at the end of the broadcast the words happy anniversary 
flashed on the screen 
ms pauley told the newspaper there has been no hostility among 
members of the today cast although she did say the place has 
been more tense since ms norville swapped duties with john palmer 
who has been sent to nbc news at sunrise 
when it was first revealed to me that john and deborah were 
going to switch that was a real blow ms pauley was quoted as 
saying i like him very much and i thought why john what did 
he do to anybody but as soon as you say anything it sounds like 
a jealous older woman talking about a younger one 
ms norville is 31 ms pauley will be 39 at the end of this 
month 
ms pauley told her interviewer that if she does leave 
today she would still like to come back to the show now and 
then in the future the way barbara walters does at good morning 
america it would be very unlike me to leave on bad terms 
as it stands now i am staying with nbc in some fashion or 
other 
ms pauleys agent has been negotiating with nbc since august 
when ms norville was promoted nbc executives who thought she was 
after more money were startled when she submitted her resignation 
according to unidentified sources cited by the post 
deborah and i are on great terms its not deborahs fault she 
is very talented and very beautiful and younger than i ms 
pauley said and my relationship with gumbel is as good as its 
ever been 
reports of bickering among the shows cast members have 
circulated since march when a memo written by gumbel was leaked 
in the memo he criticized his colleagues especially weatherman 
willard scott ms pauley was not mentioned 
we remain very very good friends ms pauley said 
referring to gumbel

trygve haavelmo of norway won the nobel 
memorial prize in economic science today for showing that 
mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the puzzling 
shifts in the economy 
haavelmos work in 1941 pioneered the field of econometrics 
which introduced statistical probability to economic forecasting 
the royal swedish academy of sciences said 
colleagues said the 77yearold haavelmo has shunned publicity 
in the past and disdained awards he was unreachable at his home in 
the oslo suburb of baerum for about five hours after the nobel was 
announced 
he later told the national nrk television that he was 
flustered and declined to be interviewed but said he may issue 
a written statement later 
im grateful for all the attention but im a little 
perplexed so i cant be very much help to you he said 
haavelmo a professor of economics at oslo university was the 
second norwegian to win the economics prize he was a research 
assistant to ragnar frisch who won the prize in 1969 the first 
year it was awarded 
the prize is worth about 469000 
econometrics holds that economic theories can be proven by 
testing them with mathematical and statistical models 
assar lindbeck chairman of the prize committee called haavelmo 
the father of modern econometrics and a dominant figure in 
postwar economic theories 
through his new economic theory scientists have learned to 
anticipate how governmental institutions react and how they 
influence peoples decisions lindbeck said when announcing the 
prize 
meghnad desai a professor at the london school of economics 
said im very happy he got the prize there has been a 
tendency to give prizes to people who benefited from his work and 
he has been in danger of being ignored 
haavelmos 1941 doctoral thesis which he presented at harvard 
university had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the 
development of econometrics the academy said in a summary of his 
achievements 
his theories gave rise to extraordinarily rapid methodological 
development and established the foundation of modern 
econometric methods the statement said 
haavelmo went to the united states on a rockefeller grant in 
1939 was a professor at the university of chicago and worked for 
the norwegian trade commission 
he returned to norway in 1947 and has been at oslo university 
since 1948 
haavelmo the son of a school administrator is a member of the 
american economic association and the american academy of arts and 
sciences he was born dec 13 1911 in the norwegian town of 
skedsmo 
the academy said haavelmos theories overcame the problems 
economists faced because they were unable to test their ideas in 
the same ways as scientists who work in laboratories 
economists also could not weed out the influence of millions of 
individual decisions that people and companies make that disturb 
the models theorists devised 
haavelmo overcame these difficulties by introducing the idea of 
statistical probability 
he also showed that misleading interpretations of individual 
relations due to interdependence cannot be avoided unless all 
relations in a theoretical model are estimated simultaneously 
the academy said 
in such areas as investment theories and economic development 
haavelmos approach has resulted in influential and farreaching 
contributions the academy said 
the approach also has helped in the analysis of macroeconomic 
fluctuations fiscal policies and price theory it said 
last years nobel laureate was maurice allais of france who won 
the prize for his theories of how price systems can work to keep 
economies in balance he was the first french economist to join the 
list of economic laureates 
americans have dominated the 19year history of the prize 
taking 15 of the 26 awards since it was created by the bank of 
sweden five winners were british 
the economics prize is a late addition to the five awards 
established in the 1896 will of alfred nobel who bequeathed his 
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific 
breakthroughs activities for peace and literature of an 
idealistic tendency

mcdonnell douglas corp said it is 
dropping its 100 million propfan jet engine program and instead 
will focus on a new generation of fuelefficient aircraft 
the new twinengine midrange commercial transport series 
dubbed the md90 was previewed on tuesday 
mcdonnell douglas said it decided to drop the propfan engine 
which it once touted as a step in aviation history because 
buyers arent interested in the innovative design 
after a number of years of research this is what the 
customers are telling us they want said walter orlowski 
mcdonnells md90 program general manager 
mcdonnell douglas introduced the experimental propfan engine in 
february 1988 it resembled a standard jet engine housing fitted 
with external blades similar to light aircraft propellers but with 
16 curved blades 
the novelty and designers claims about increased fuel 
efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry 
officials said 
despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel 
consumption by 40 percent mcdonnell douglas failed to get a single 
order for the engine type company vice president john wolf said 
our customers indicated they were not interested in buying 
it wolf said 
the gamble to develop the propfan engine was based on the 
belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s but 
prices instead held steady 
the md90 aircrafts which will come in two sizes are also 
designed to save fuel the 114seat version is expected to be 13 
percent more fuel efficient and the 153seat version will save 17 
percent more fuel over older aircraft models company officials 
predicted 
the company declined to say how much they planned to invest in 
the new planes but industry analysts estimate the development cost 
at between 300 million to 400 million 
the md90 series will be powered by a v2500 engine produced by 
the consortium international aero engines the consortium included 
american manufacturer pratt amp whitney and the british firm 
rollsroyce west german italian and japanese companies 
wolf declined to say how many orders the company needs to 
receive before they begin production of the md90s but they have 
already begun their pitch to airlines to line up orders mcdonnell 
douglas hopes to begin making deliveries as early as the fourth 
quarter of 1994 
the company spent about 100 million developing the propfan jet 
engines officials said

ramada incs restructuring including the sale 
of its hotels to a hong kong company has been placed on hold the 
company said today 
ramada cited unfavorable conditions in the highyield credit 
market as the reason for its decision not to proceed with an 
offering of 400 million in debt securities which is a 
prerequisite for the restructuring 
the phoenixbased company announced earlier this year that it 
would sell its worldwide hotel business to new world hotel holdings 
ltd of hong kong and form a new company aztar corp to operate 
its nevada and new jersey casinos 
arranging financing for aztar is a condition of completing the 
sale ramada said 
the company originally announced that it would offer 170 
million in firstmortgage notes and 230 million in bonds and on 
oct 3 said it was considering issuing warrants for 10 percent of 
aztars common stock 
ramada management intends to develop a revised restructuring 
proposal that will involve a modification to the consideration to 
be received by ramada shareholders the company said in a 
statement 
shareholders were to have received cash and stock in aztar under 
the original plan 
any new plan would require amendment of provisions in the 
agreement with new world and an extension of the nov 30 deadline 
for completing the sale the company said 
it also would require approval of shareholders and gaming 
regulators in nevada and new jersey 
ramada said it can offer no assurance that a restructuring 
will be completed and it cannot specifiy the timing of the next 
steps

europes airlines are rushing to join forces and 
forge ties with american and far eastern counterparts in an attempt 
to create megacarriers in an increasingly global and competitive 
industry 
in addition small airlines are springing up to challenge 
europes heavyweight national airlines and the governments that 
own these big flag carriers are selling them gradually to private 
investors 
these developments represent a major restructuring of the air 
travel industry on this side of the atlantic its part of the 
european economic communitys attempt to to dismantle the old 
airline system ahead of the end of 1992 when the 12nation bloc 
will become a trade barrierfree marketplace 
but there are concerns that europes airlines may become too 
concentrated and powerful because the number of carriers will be 
reduced hurting competition and ultimately the farepaying 
passenger 
some worry that europe could be following the path of the 
deregulated airline industry in the united states where takeovers 
and consolidation have reduced the number of competitors 
the move by some leading european airlines to buy stakes in us 
airlines also has aroused controversy in the united states where 
such holdings are limited to 25 percent 
the us department of transportation has ordered klm royal 
dutch airlines to cut its 400 million investment in northwest 
airlines parent company nwa inc to 176 million even though the 
planned stake came to only 5 percent the department said the 
deals size and structure might give klm too much control 
the department also might intervene in british airways proposal 
to buy a 15 percent stake in united airlines parent ual corp for 
750 million 
there is radical change going on said stephen clapham a 
european airlines analyst with the london investment firm hoare 
govett ltd the general climate within europe is one of an 
increasing trend toward free market forces and the reduction of 
government influence 
hans krakauer deputy chairman of the international airline 
passengers association in london said european airlines fear the 
effect of liberalization on their own structure and therefore are 
looking at the idea of allying themselves with erstwhile 
competitors 
there is a certain fashion at the moment about joining up with 
somebody said michael bishop chairman of british midland 
airways 
the trendsetter is scandinavian airlines system the first 
airline to buy a stake in an american airline a year ago it 
acquired 10 percent of texas air corp parent of continental and 
eastern airlines 
sas also holds a 25 percent stake in british midland and 
cooperation agreements with japans all nippon airways and 
thailands thai international in addition sas plans to invest in 
swissair 
british airways europes largest airline was denationalized in 
1987 and has teamed with united for two years under a joint 
marketing agreement 
ba also acquired smaller rival british caledonian airways nearly 
two years ago and is seeking a joint stake with klm in sabena 
belgian world airways ba has attempted but so far failed to 
obtain a stake in air new zealand 
no 2ranked lufthansa german airlines and no 3 air france 
recently announced a wideranging cooperation agreement that 
expands an existing relationship 
they said they would cooperate on cargo pilot training 
aircraft purchases marketing catering and duty free sales they 
also said they hope for a similar pact with iberia international 
airlines of spain 
swissair and delta air lines meanwhile have bought 5 percent 
stakes in each other 
not everybody is convinced that the airlines will benefit from 
such ties but there is a growing recognition among the european 
carriers they are facing stiffer competition from overseas rivals 
in america and elsewhere 
the carriers also fear that the eecs 320 million people wont 
be enough to sustain europes 21 major carriers and that to grow 
they must expand abroad 
in the past it was governments that set routes capacity and 
fares in bilateral agreements which often acted as effective 
cartels between any two given destinations 
the european commission the eecs governing body has been 
gradually relaxing these restrictions this liberalization is 
creating more choice and cheaper fares but not fast enough said 
krakauer from the passengers group 
a good example of deregulations potential effects comes from 
the londondublin route controlled by british airways and aer 
lingus until 1986 when the governments allowed a new irish carrier 
ryanair into the market 
today six airlines ply the route and ryanair flying to luton 
airport north of london charges as little as 68 irish pounds or 
about 96 for a roundtrip compared with 121 pounds or 171 on aer 
lingus which has more daily flights and lands at londons heathrow 
airport 
ryanair is still losing money but there has been a jump in 
passenger traffic through dublin airport from 29 million in 1986 
to an estimated 5 million this year 
by linking up the airlines want to channel passengers to each 
other reduce costs and gain access to crucial computer 
reservations systems which are expensive and are operated mainly 
by the large airlines 
all competitors are seeking more takeoff and landing slots at 
airports one of the most important keys to profitable routes 
increased traffic has strained airport capacity and europes 
complex air control system 
staff shortages outmoded equipment and strikes by air traffic 
controllers have turned summer travel into a regular ordeal for 
europeans and experts say the only solution is to integrate 
europes 22 different national air control systems into one 
sprawling network 
the major european airlines carried nearly 63 million passengers 
on scheduled european flights in 1988 up nearly 7 percent from the 
previous year while 75 smaller european carriers offer scheduled 
international services up from 20 in 1978 the brusselsbased 
association of european airlines said 
smaller airlines are linking up with bigger ones to defend their 
routes 
the small fellows are going to have to become the tail end of 
the big ones or come up with some brilliant commercial idea on how 
to stay in existence in this competition krakauer said 
what worries some europeans is the possible anticompetitive 
effect of joint agreements particularly among dominant carriers 
which the european commission is reviewing 
i could see big airlines preventing others from using the big 
airports or preventing newcomers from having access to airports or 
access to computer reservations systems said avishai gil a 
transportation industry specialist with the international labor 
organization a genevabased united nations agency 
it really depends on the governments gil said nobody 
knows how things will go 
british midlands bishop said its very important that the 
consequences of deregulation in america are not repeated in europe 
which is a consolidation of the airlines which is not necessarily 
in the interest of consumers

hundreds of lady beetles and wasps have been 
imported from the soviet union by the agriculture department to 
help american farmers battle the russian wheat aphid 
the predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid and after 
evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests 
such biological controls are being sought by usda scientists as 
helpmates or even complete replacements for chemical pesticides 
the chemicals are not only costly for farmers but can threaten food 
crops and the environment when used improperly 
in all three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles 
were collected during may and june in the southern region of the 
soviet union the departments agricultural research service 
reported tuesday 
actual collecting of the hundreds of specimens was done by 
insect pathologist tadeusz poprawski and entomologist francis 
gruber who work for the agencys parasite laboratory in behoust 
france 
during their explorations poprawski and gruber were based at a 
new sovietamerican biological control laboratory in kishinev 
moldavia the insects were sent to a usda laboratory in newark 
del for quarantine rearing of new generations and distribution 
the departments richard s soper said in a statement that the 
wasps and beetles are the first exchanges of biological pest 
controls to come from recent usda research agreements with the 
soviet union 
soper coordinates research on biological pest controls for the 
usda agency in beltsville md he left on monday for the soviet 
union to help plan next years joint studies and explorations 
the russian wheat aphid first spotted in the united states in 
1986 in texas has spread to 16 states in just three years 
damaging wheat barley rye and oats aphids were said to cost 
farmers an estimated 123 million last ear in grain losses and 
chemical controls 
officials said two species of soviet wasps were sent in august 
to a usda research unit in stillwater okla for evaluation with 
other wasps from turkey syria jordan and france to determine the 
best candidates for field tests 
some other wasps were shipped to the departments massrearing 
facility in mission texas to produce more specimens and the 
lady beetles are being multiplied in niles mich research on 
the beetles will be done at the agencys facility in brookings sd

the meat business may be headed for better 
times if current indications prove out says an industry spokesman 
c manly molpus president of the american meat institute said 
the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have 
stabilized over the last year or so further he said there are 
solid indications that demand for pork is increasing 
retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with 
more vigor than might have been expected after the flattodown 
trend that characterized most of the decade of the 1980s molpus 
said and the export value of meat and meat products surpassed 
the value of imports for the first time ever last year 
molpuss comments were in the associations meat facts yearbook 
for 1989 which was distributed tuesday 
cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low and beef 
supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers 
hold back cattle to expand herd sizes he said on the pork 
side poor producer returns have likely slowed herd expansion with 
the result that pork supplies could be slightly smaller next year

soviet union an additional 150000 metric tons of us soybean meal 
for delivery in 198990 under a longterm supply agreement

250000 tons for 198990 the agriculture department said tuesday

soviet union has bought 37 million tons of corn under the 
agreement no wheat has yet been sold for 198990 delivery however

tons of soybean meal could have a value of around 30 million 
based on recent prices quoted at us processing plants

barbara jackle and her husband say they lucked out by finding a 
reliable woman who could watch their son for 85 a week though 
they had to make special arrangements for him to attend school near 
the caregivers home miles away 
and thats good for only one year said mrs jackle 37 a 
librarian who lives in upper darby pa near philadelphia were 
even contemplating the possibility of moving so we could be closer 
to where she is 
the scramble by the jackles to find a trustworthy sitter for 
their 5yearold reflects the growth in twoincome families among 
the babyboom generation which in turn has created an enormous 
problem for working parents nationwide caring for their kids and 
paying for it 
nowadays it seems if youre going to need care youd better 
get set up before you get pregnant said louise hurst a licensed 
daycare professional who watches the jackle boy and five other 
small children in her home 
ive gotten lots of calls said mrs hurst 43 i inform 
them im full until september 1991 so i dont even bother to take 
a waiting list 
demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have 
multiplied in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a 
second income 
this has crimped budgets of millions of americans created an 
underground cash economy of unregulated caregivers and forced 
many companies to offer allowances ranging from flexible work 
schedules to emergency sitters to attract or retain valued 
employees 
some prominent employers have gone further allowing young 
mothers and fathers to work at home or take years off with full 
benefits and job guarantees others are building inhouse daycare 
centers hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with 
cash payments 
certainly its fashionable these days for corporations to get 
into this said antony ward director of child care inc a new 
york referral service retained by many companies to assist 
employees in finding help 
a lot of people viscerally respond to the childcare issue 
he said anyone who takes the kid to the family daycare provider 
to find a note on the door saying i have the flu knows what 
its like 
first bank system of st paul minn for example has donated 
space in its office this year for a public kindergarten that 
doubles as an afterschool daycare center with priority given to 
children of bank employees ncnb corp a fastgrowing bank in 
charlotte nc plans to offer up to a 50 percent reimbursement of 
childcare costs to many of its workers 
pitney bowes inc a leading maker of business machines in 
stamford conn helped pioneer flexible working hours to 
accommodate working parents allowing them to arrive early some 
days and leave early on others federal express corp the memphis 
tenn overnight delivery service offers working parents fourday 
weeks and 7 am to 3 pm shifts 
last month seven large new yorkbased employers announced a 
pilot program of emergency child care for workers whose usual 
arrangements have been disrupted the program is aimed at reducing 
absenteeism 
companies are finding that if theyre not family friendly 
theyre losing employees said lorraine dusky a freelance 
writer who coauthored the best companies for women a 
guidebook to 50 leading american corporations companies arent 
doing this to be altruistic if companies dont do something were 
in trouble 
nonetheless the highprofile benefits of a relatively few 
companies mask what critics call a deepening crisis in a labor pool 
comprised increasingly of women historically the primary family 
caregivers 
childcare activists say the majority of businesses will not 
concede that its a a workrelated issue despite evidence that 
employer assistance leads to lower turnover higher employee morale 
and improved productivity moreover they say the federal 
government isnt providing much help 
although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for 
child care is working through congress it faces the possibility of 
a white house veto because of the estimated 227 billion cost over 
the next five years 
president bush has proposed more modest legislation that would 
cost 25 billion a year by 1993 mostly through tax credits 
still thats less than 20 a week or about 1000 a year and 
would only go to lowerincome families 
by contrast outofhome childcare costs can range from 1500 
to 10000 a year the conference board business research group 
said in a study other studies have shown inhome costs can go much 
higher 
we have a system that has not caught up with rapid social 
change in our society in which more women are back in the labor 
force and need child care said esther j kahn director of 
parents place a san francisco counseling and referral service 
our society hasnt provided support for families 
a study for the labor department by the hudson institute an 
indianapolis research organization shows women now comprise nearly 
half the work force compared with 381 percent in 1970 and 296 
percent in 1950 
other labor department figures show 57 percent of all women with 
children under 6 work outside the home vs 12 percent in 1950 a 
study by the childrens defense fund a washingtonbased 
childadvocacy group predicts twothirds of all preschool children 
will have mothers in the work force by 1995 
only 7 percent of american households now fit the beaver 
cleaver familys mold of breadwinning father and athome mother 
says a policy paper by the child care action campaign a new york 
coalition that advocates a national system of care as female 
labor force participation rates continue to climb the demand for 
child care will grow too

the vast majority of working parents must contend with a 
hodgepodge hitormiss system for finding help they can trust and 
afford stories abound of caregivers and sitters who ignore 
abandon abuse or kidnap children 
in a case that gained nationwide attention last march a 
chattanooga tenn sitter was sentenced to a year in jail after 
the parents of a 6yearold boy secretly videotaped her viciously 
slapping their child in august a daycare provider near hartford 
conn was arrested after a 3yearold child died in the womans 
locked car evidently from heat stroke 
a recent article in child magazine offered tips on how to avoid 
babysitters from hell 
many working parents rely on referrals from friends and 
relatives to hire help but the result often is an unlicensed 
untrained caregiver who can range from a total stranger to the 
grandmotherly widow down the block 
for the jackles and other clients of mrs hurst who found her 
by wordofmouth the main attractions included her state license 
to practice inhome day care her acceptance of payment by check 
her willingness to keep children until 7 pm and her 85 weekly 
bill which includes food but perhaps the biggest draw of all was 
mrs hursts reliability 
we have friends who have gone through sitters every other 
week said mrs jackle who had taken time off to raise her son 
for the first few years for a while i wasnt sure i was going 
back to work or not 
the daycare dilemma has been compounded by the practice of many 
caregivers to take cash only so they dont have to report the 
income on their tax returns an estimated 7 billion in daycare 
income goes unreported annually 
this year for the first time parents must provide the name and 
social security number of their daycare provider to the internal 
revenue service to qualify for a tax credit to defray part of the 
cost the irs plans to use the information to crossreference the 
returns of providers and prosecute cheaters 
daycare experts believe the law could make it even harder for 
parents to afford day care since many providers will raise their 
rates to compensate for having to pay tax 
its a situation where the government hasnt helped parents on 
child care very much at all said judsen culbreth editor of 
working mother magazine now theyre making it even harder 
barbara reisman executive director of the child care action 
campaign also criticized the tax crackdown 
childcare workers are the lowest paid workers in this 
country one of the ways people are able to survive are to be paid 
without having to declare the income she said 
i dont recommend people cheat on their taxes she said 
but many parents cant afford to pay the full cost of care this 
doesnt address the real problem

trygve haavelmo a norwegian professor 
who dislikes awards for academics won the nobel memorial prize in 
economic science on wednesday for using statistics and probability 
to forecast how economies behave 
haavelmo had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the new 
science of econometrics with his probability theory the royal 
swedish academy of sciences said in announcing the award 
i am honored anyone would be but i had nothing to do with 
making this award i really have nothing to say said haavelmo 
77 in an interview 
the prize is quite irrelevant to the real issues im 
exhausted and i have nothing more to say he added 
haavelmo who still works part time at the university of oslo 
has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes colleagues said 
tore thornstad a coworker at the university described haavelmo 
as a shy reserved person who prefers research and teaching to 
being in the limelight 
in his 1941 doctoral dissertation for harvard university 
haavelmo pioneered the field of econometrics which introduced 
statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting 
the thesis was published in 1944 ten years later he published a 
book of his research on economic development theory 
the academy of sciences said in its citation that haavelmo was 
awarded the 469000 prize for his clarification of the 
probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of 
simultaneous economic structures 
assar lindbeck head of the academys prize committee and a 
personal friend of haavelmo called him the father of modern 
econometrics and a dominant figure in postwar economic theories 
as soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a 
longterm projection it is econometrics that charts the 
relationship between all quantitative economic analyses lindbeck 
told reporters 
haavelmo was the second norwegian to win the economics prize 
since it was introduced in 1969 by the bank of sweden and added to 
the five other nobel prizes ragnar frisch who once employed 
haavelmo as a a research assistant won the prize in its inaugural 
year 
haavelmo is a member of the american economic association and 
the american academy of arts and sciences 
he was born dec 13 1911 in the town of skedsmo a few miles 
east of oslo the son of a school administrator he graduated from 
the university of oslo in 1933 
he moved to the united states in 1939 at the outbreak of world 
war ii on a rockefeller grant and worked at the university of 
chicago and later in new york with the norwegian trade ministry 
haavelmos doctoral thesis won him immediate recognition a 
think tank of young economic scientists from several nationalities 
the cowles commission was created to pursue the ideas he raised 
and other theories 
haavelmo returned to norway in 1947 and became professor of 
economics at the university of oslo 
i see haavelmo as an original thinker but one who always kept 
his theories relevant to the real world said thorvald moe a 
senior official of the norwegian finance ministry 
according to his sisterinlaw mrs margit haavelmo he never 
married and his only brother died five years ago he is a very 
wellliked man mrs haavelmo said in a telephone interview 
roedseth director of oslo universitys social economics 
institute said haavelmo usually comes in to work several times a 
week although he went on full pension 10 years ago

most soybean and corn futures prices closed 
slightly higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade as traders 
finetuned their positions in preparation for thursdays 
agriculture department crop report 
wheat futures posted modest losses reflecting a lack of new 
export demand 
the usda crop report scheduled for release after thursdays 
close is expected to indicate slightly larger corn and soybean 
harvests than the usdas september estimates of 189 billion 
bushels of soybeans and 732 billion bushels of corn 
a survey of private crop analysts taken earlier this week showed 
estimates averaging 192 billion bushels of soybeans and 74 
billion bushels of corn 
but estimates released late tuesday by respected private crop 
analyst conrad leslie came in slightly below those averages 
prompting some buying of futures this morning 
analysts also attributed wednesdays modest rally to buying 
inspired by the soybean markets tumble to 23month lows on tuesday 
the markets have really gotten battered around and were 
oversold said joel karlin an analyst in chicago with research 
department inc which provides research services to brokers 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in december at 404 a bushel corn 
futures were unchanged to 1 cents higher with december at 235 a 
bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cent higher with december at

an attempt by gulf states utilities co 
to make customers pay 14 billion of the costs of the river bend 
nuclear power plant was rejected wednesday by a state judge 
district judge paul landry backed a contention by the public 
service commission that the costs were imprudent and should not be 
passed on to customers in their electric rates 
however landrys order left open the possibility of the costs 
being brought into the rate structure by the psc in the future the 
psc had argued that gulf states should have built a less expensive 
electric generating plant fueled by lignite coal 
the decision sent the companys stock reeling in late afternoon 
trading on the new york stock exchange gulf states utilities was 
the most active issue and tumbled 250 a share to 1175 
tom phillips an attorney for gulf states said he would review 
the decision before deciding whether to appeal 
landry rejected a motion by state attorney general william guste 
to disallow all costs associated with river bend from the rate 
base the commission earlier agreed to allow gulf states to include 
16 billion in costs from the plant 
in my opinion this defeats the entire purpose of 
regulation said assistant attorney general dave mcneill for 
the next who knows how many years the 14 billion hangs over the 
heads of the rate payers 
but psc member louis lambert said the decision means rate payers 
wont be charged for 14 billion of river bend nuclear plant 
because the court held that gsu had enough information at the time 
to know they should have built a lignite coal unit 
the longrunning dispute between gulf states and the psc stems 
from the utilitys decision in 1979 to proceed with the 
construction of river bend located near st francisville la 
company officials said the decision was based upon the best 
possible information about future electric needs in louisiana and 
the type of fuel that should be used to generate power 
the psc contended that gsu continued with construction plans 
only to recoup its costs after a buyer could not be found for the 
45 billion project the plant began commercial operation in 1986 
cajun electric power cooperative shared in the construction costs

most major foreign currencies despite heavy selling by central 
banks and a surprise hike in the japanese discount rate 
gold prices rose after falling slightly overseas 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery closed at 362 a troy ounce a 1 increase from tuesday

still isnt going down said a senior dealer at a us investment

effective only in taking the sting out of what looked to be a 
fairly vicious upward move 
j thomas stanley manager of corporate foreign exchange for 
chemical new york capital markets group said the dollar was being 
supported by the belief that us interest rates would hold steady 
fed chairman alan greenspan hinted during a meeting in moscow on 
tuesday that rates would stay firm in the near term regardless of 
the currencys movements he expressed concern that attempts to 
maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to destabilizing 
international capital flows 
those remarks helped push the dollar sharply higher in tuesday 
trading since firmer interest rates tend to support a currency

cbs inc reported a 11 percent decline in 
thirdquarter earnings wednesday primarily because a severe drop 
in income from joint ventures offset gains in television 
advertising 
the network said it earned 618 million or 240 a share in the 
three months ended sept 30 compared with 698 million or 272 a 
share in the yearearlier period thirdquarter sales totaled 
5935 million vs 568 million a 4 percent increase 
cbs attributed most of the earnings drop to an 826 percent 
decline in thirdquarter income from cbsfox a joint venture 
between cbs and twentieth century fox that markets and distributes 
home videcassettes cbs said it earned 12 million from the joint 
venture in the period vs 69 million a year ago 
president and chief executive officer laurence a tisch said 
that despite the decline the companys key television operations 
were performing well helped by gains in ad income no unusual 
disruptions to the fall season and lower costs from the absence of 
presidential campaign coverage this year 
with a robust advertising market and better ratings over last 
years strikedisrupted program schedule the television network is 
expected to show imrpoved results for the balance of the year 
tisch said 
for the first nine months of 1989 cbs said it earned 2369 
million or 921 a share a 3 percent decline from the 2433 
million or 946 million a share earned in the yearearlier period 
sales totaled 21 billion vs 20 billion a 5 percent increase 
if discontinued operations from 1988 are included in the 
figures earnings for the first nine months of 1989 would have 
fallen 79 percent from a year earlier when company earnings were 
inflated by 8666 million from the sale of its records subsidiary 
to sony corp

when you have an airline for sale who do you 
call dont ask carl icahn 
icahn the takeover specialist who completed his 12 billion 
buyout of trans world airlines inc last year has been rumored for 
several months to be looking to unload the airline through a sale 
or merger or another kind of management change 
twa employees have heard through the grapevine that icahn has 
talked with other major airlines other takeover experts even st 
louisbased corporate giants anheuserbusch cos inc and mcdonnell 
douglas corp 
the brewer and the aircraft maker often are approached to help 
bail out local companies and institutions twa could fit nicely 
with mcdonnell douglas the worlds secondlargest builder of 
commercial jets after boeing co 
icahn also had expressed interest some months ago in strikebound 
eastern airlines hinting at a possible merger between eastern and 
twa 
the latest speculation comes against a background of takeover 
fever sweeping the nations airline industry an investor group 
recently acquired northwest airlines parent nwa inc for 365 
billion while a pilotmanagement coalition is trying to buy ual 
corp united airlines parent for 675 billion just last week 
developer donald trump made a record 7 billion offer for amr 
corp which owns american airlines the nations largest and most 
profitable 
mark buckstein twas general counsel at its corporate 
headquarters in mt kisco ny declined comment wednesday on the 
rumors concerning icahn 
no mr right has come out of the woodwork said morten 
beyer chairman of avmark inc an aviation consulting firm based 
in arlington va i would say there certainly hasnt been a 
stampede to buy twa 
but beyer and other analysts said its clear that something 
needs to be done to help twa which began this decade as the 
nations secondlargest airline and is now near the bottom of the 
list of majors 
will twa end up as part of an airline merger 
mark daugherty an airline analyst with dean witter reynolds 
inc in new york said he doesnt think so 
i dont think the government would allow it daugherty said 
the usairpiedmont merger barely squeaked by and i dont see a 
twa merger with a major carrier making it 
if its not another airline then its anybodys guess what will 
happen 
twa workers are just hoping something happens soon the waiting 
is becoming unbearable said herb johnson president of the 
machinists unions local 1650 
its a tremendous amount of stress on our people the anxiety 
is growing said johnson whos based in kansas city mo where 
twa has a large maintenance facility 
our people are trying to plan vacations or trying to figure 
out whether to buy a new car just like everyone else in america 
johnson said but we cant do anything because we dont know if 
well have a job when we wake up 
the rumors have been passed around the workplace for so long he 
said that nobody knows what to expect 
its really become a joke johnson said 
analysts say several major problems have contributed to the 
decline of twa and are probably also keeping suitors from rushing 
to buy the airline 
chief among the troubles are financial woes 
through the first half of the year twa reported losses of 875 
million while many of the nations other major carriers have been 
posting record profits 
the company which icahn took private last october also has to 
repay 400 million in interest payments this year and has 17 
billion in principal and interest payments coming due in later 
years 
the airline also has a fairly dissatisfied workforce 
johnson said twa aircraft mechanics havent received a raise in 
five years while ticket agents and reservation clerks are being 
paid the same amount they were in 1980 
the 16000 twa employees in the machinists union have been 
working under a contract that expired last october the airlines 
pilots among the lowest paid among major carriers are continuing 
a lawsuit challenging the manner in which icahn took the company 
private 
the pilots lost the suit in new york supreme court and have 
appealed that decision according to david berkeley a spokesman 
for the twa pilots 
another big concern is the age of twas fleet the secondoldest 
among major us carriers the company has ordered 40 new planes 
from europes airbus industrie but the first shipment of 20 of 
those jets wont be ready until 1994

unisys corp entered the emerging market 
of digital image processing wednesday with two systems that will 
allow crisp images of checks and blueprints to be stored 
electronically

the first quarter of 1990 for an average of 15 million to 3 
million combined with the software image check processing system 
it will allow highspeed image processing of payment items for the 
banking industry 
the unisys infoimage engineering document management system 
available now starting at 500000 allows storage of such 
documents as blueprints engineering drawings charts and building 
diagrams software permits the digitized documents to be indexed 
and called up onto display work stations along with data in other 
computer systems 
unisys is committed to a leadership role in the imaging 
revolution which will produce more than 5 billion in revenue by 
1992 up from 800 million in 1988 said lw roy beers vice 
president for document imaging systems 
dennis p farkas vice president for financial and imaging 
programs said imaging allows banks to reduce the repeated physical 
handling of paper items which leads to processing errors 
savings in labor and other costs will pay for the system in 
about three years he said 
were looking at this as a major growth area for the 
company he said 
unisys expects to capture 40 percent to 45 percent of a 
projected 23 billion paymentitem processing market by 1993 of 
which 12 billion will be in imaging he said 
unisys currently has about a 25 percent share of the 850 
million traditional processing market worldwide he said 
chase manhattan bank huntington bancshares inc of columbus 
ohio and the northern trust co of chicago have announced plans to 
use the checkprocessing system unisys said 
rollsroyce and associates ltd of britain the hightechnology 
defense contracting subsidiary of rollsroyce plc will use the 
document system 
unisys said last month it had formed a corporate office for 
imaging systems to coordinate a comprehensive strategic commitment 
to document and payment imaging systems it said technology had 
progressed to the point where imaging systems could generate fast 
payback and cost savings to a broad range of users 
in recent weeks unisys also announced a series of strategic 
relationships with industryleading image technology vendors to 
integrate their innovative technology into unisys information 
management systems

thirdquarter earnings for the nations big three 
automakers are expected to tumble from last years levels 
primarily because of sales incentive costs analysts say 
on the balance sheet incentive costs come directly out of north 
american operations general motors corp and ford motor co have 
profitable overseas operations especially in europe but chrysler 
corp doesnt 
consequently chryslers earnings could take a big hit when the 
big three report their earnings during the week of oct 23 
incentive costs sometimes called marketing expenses have been 
heavy during the second and third quarters of 1989 for the big 
three each embarked on extensive rebate and lowinterest financing 
programs as the second quarter began and continued them through the 
third quarter mostly to remove built up inventories before the 
1990 model year began oct 1 
you know whats a killer marketing expenses which could be 
as high as 1000 a car said analyst kathleen heaney of nikko 
securities co international inc of new york city 
analysts estimates of thirdquarter earnings vary greatly but 
each is significantly lower for each company compared to the same 
threemonth period a year ago during the third quarter of 1988 
the big three earned a combined 183 billion or 351 a share to 
post the best third quarter in history 
this year combined earnings should be somewhere around 102 
billion or about 195 a share analysts figures show thats down 
443 percent 
its not going to be a pretty quarter said analyst douglas 
laughlin of bear stearns amp co of new york 
he attributed nearly all the sour performance to north american 
operations as did independent analyst david healy 
i think chances are that a break even or loss in north 
american operations will affect all three healy said 
even though incentives eat into profits none of the big three 
are shying away from them so far in the fourth quarter gm ford 
and chrysler have offered rebates lowinterest financing or 
specialized promotions nationwide and regionally for 1989 and 1990 
cars 
some of the programs were introduced on 1990 vehicles even 
before the cars and trucks officially went on sale 
less profitable north american operations affect not only the 
balance sheet for the corporation but profit sharing for the 
companies workers each contract between a big three automaker and 
the united auto workers union contains a formula for figuring 
profit sharing checks for the workers 
the amount of the check is directly related to the profitability 
of a companys operations in north america

hilton hotels corp reported a 29 
percent rise in earnings wednesday for its third quarter with 
increased hotel profits offset by lower returns from casinos 
separately spokesman william lebo said several suitors had 
signed confidentiality agreements to examine hiltons books as the 
corporation continues its slow and deliberate effort to sell 
itself 
for the third quarter ended sept 30 hilton said it earned 
281 million or 58 cents per share on revenues of 2485 
million in the same period last year hilton earned 273 million 
or 57 cents per share on revenues of 2361 million

but was partially offset by 15 million in startup costs at new 
properties hilton said gaming income fell 10 percent to 297 
million 
corporate expenses rose 79 percent to 104 million mainly 
because of unanticipated settlement costs relating to a property 
deal in an earlier year hilton said 
for the nine months ended sept 30 hilton said its earnings 
fell 14 percent to 832 million or 172 per share from 957 
million or 199 a share a year earlier ninemonth revenue rose 
6 percent to 7386 million from 6992 million a year earlier 
in august after settlement of the contested will of founder 
conrad hilton the company put itself up for sale some analysts 
estimated it could fetch more than 6 billion

with his dapper suits executive salary and swank 
office equipped with a kitchen and shoepolish machine tom baker 
seems an unlikely leader of the knockdown dragout machinists 
strike against boeing co 
since becoming president of district lodge 751 international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers in 1980 baker has 
been criticized by dissidents in the aerospace giants largest 
union for what they call his coziness with management 
at age 52 a rural arkansas native who went from seaman to 
boeing electronics technician before making organized labor his 
career he was far from itching to strike 
nonetheless he recommended rejection of a threeyear contract 
matching or exceeding most major recent settlements nationally a 
strike was approved on an 85 percent vote oct 3 
sometimes it takes a strike to get what you want but if there 
is a long strike some people can wind up suffering baker said 
thats the part i dont like 
the offer included 4 percent raises the first year and 3 percent 
in each of the next two years productivity bonuses of 8 percent of 
gross pay the first year and 3 percent the second year less 
mandatory overtime and more benefits 
union members whose tasks range from riveting to delicate 
instrument calibrations were making 17534 to 37377 a year 
before the strike 
doug hammond a federal mediator who assisted in prestrike 
contract negotiations couldnt predict the outcome of the strike 
vote by 40000 union members baker was certain 
he really has a feel for the people he represents hammond 
said 
dissident franklin e knowles 51 a toolmaker and 24year union 
member from everett wash emphasized that despite his criticisms 
of baker i never said he was stupid 
bakers predecessor albert wydick led the last strike against 
boeing a 45day walkout in 1977 in 1980 wydick withdrew from an 
election battle with baker in exchange for a better paying less 
stressful union job 
i do not believe he had the basic abilities that tom baker has 
the savvy the intelligence knowles said 
favoring natty threepiece suits sporting an impeccably trimmed 
mustache and carefully coiffed silver hair softspoken and 
cautious baker was the first to win three consecutive terms of 
what is now the largest of iams 162 district lodges without a 
ballot opponent 
i think he really typifies the local leadership of the 
machinists nationwide said machinists president george kourpias 
hes a good administrator kourpias said hes also a good 
leader he has brought some stability to that district lodge 
critics say baker has artfully ensured that only his supporters 
were elected to the district council only council members chosen 
from the districts seven locals may run for president 
tom finnegan a machine operator and 35year boeing employee in 
auburn wash who lost his district council seat to a baker 
supporter said the president would have lost had he faced ballot 
opposition 
even with the strike finnegan said a lot of people figure 
hes just too cozy with the company 
antibaker leaflets circulated through boeing plants last year 
titled truth not trivia zeroed in on a 175 percent increase in 
base salary for baker in 1987 lavish travel spending and the 94 
million spent on bakers taj mahal a brickandglass edifice 
featuring a soaring glass atrium that opened in july a few blocks 
from boeing headquarters 
the presidents suite includes a fully equipped kitchen a 
conference table and easel a row of model boeings on a shelf an 
electric rotary shoe buffer couch easy chairs and coffee table 
baker who received 75343 in salary and per diem and 27546 
for expenses last year for a total compensation of 102889 
dismissed critics as petty carpers who dont stand for 
something 
the building replaced a 40yearold cramped and outmoded union 
hall and an image of permanence and strength was essential he 
asserted 
rarely does baker raise his voice even at times like a visit to 
the picket line outside boeing headquarters the day the strike 
began 
wearing a blue union sweatshirt over jeans and white athletic 
shoes he waved his picket sign high grinning 
as head of the 43300 boeing machinists in the seattle area 
nearly fourfifths of the 57800 workers represented by the union 
nationwide baker has visited the picket lines daily 
he has a boeing family two sons ages 30 and 28 are on strike 
as is his 25yearold daughter and two of their spouses the 
younger sons wife a salaried employee at boeing remains on the 
job 
in even tones bearing unmistakeable traces of the ozark 
mountains baker described a rural childhood of hardship 
he was born in harrison ark but the family moved to the 
bakersfield calif area when he was young his father worked on 
irrigation systems and picked cotton baker later joined his father 
in the fields cramming in schoolwork between seasons 
in about the fifth or sixth grade he contracted rheumatic fever 
and the family returned to arkansas because his parents thought it 
would improve his health he later completed high school there and 
joined the navy 
when they said well give you a free airplane ticket i 
said im yours he recalled 
after four years at sea where he began working with 
electronics he found work at boeing mostly dealing with ballistic 
missile circuitry and control systems 
the union was not something i had given any thought to but i 
happened to hit a shop that was wellorganized with good 
strong exposure to union people he said 
in about 1959 he became a shop steward and eventually went on to 
become a local president and a business representative 
in his first campaign for district president he joined a 
groundswell of feeling that incumbent wydick was weak 
three years later baker clashed with justin ostro an iam vice 
president who coordinates aerospace industry negotiations over a 
contract offer that for the first time sacrificed wage 
increases in favor of bonuses 
ostro urged members to reject the contract baker said vote yes 
the members followed baker 
in 1986 despite a determined union effort to return to 
increases in basic wage rates a narrowly approved contract 
provided only another round of bonuses 
this year citing an extensive survey showing 62 percent of 
boeing workers wanted wage gains baker made the issue a contract 
demand 
kourpias dismissed bakers past clashes with the international 
leadership or grand lodge and asserted hehad worked closely with 
him from the day he was elected 
kourpias also said baker would be a strong candidate for a 
higher position within the parent union but baker said hes not 
interested 
i think this job is really a better job than the vice 
presidents job in the parent union here i can make things 
happen he said

frozen pork belly futures prices climbed sharply wednesday on 
the chicago mercantile exchange boosted by stronger cash markets 
shrinking supplies and bullish technical signals 
on other commodity markets livestock energy and precious 
metals were mostly higher while grain futures were mixed 
frozen pork bellies settled 110 cents to 122 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in february at 4772 cents a pound the 
rally erased most of the losses piled up in the three previous 
sessions 
pork belly prices have been recovering slowly since early 
september after sliding to 18year lows during the summer as 
supplies piled up in warehouses a function of declining 
consumption of bacon which is made from pork bellies 
the governments decision to include pork bellies in food aid to 
poland helped get the market moving again last month as did a drop 
in retail bacon prices to levels that some consumers apparently 
found irresistible 
on sept 22 the agriculture department reported a record 
454millionpound drop in frozen pork belly stocks from aug 1 to 
sept 1 to 50 million pounds more recent statistics indicate the 
stockpile continues to shrink 
the chicago mercantile exchange on wednesday reported a 
24millionpound decline last week in bellies stored in warehouses 
outside of chicago 
as much as anything the bellies are getting energy from 
fairly good outmovement said dale durchholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
meanwhile the dry sunny weather of the past month has kept 
many pork producers focused on harvesting corn and soybeans instead 
of marketing hogs temporarily reducing hog supplies and forcing 
meatpackers to pay more for the animals and charge more for pork 
products 
this kink in the pork pipeline is a seasonal phenomenon but 
its kind of extraordinary this year durchholz said because 
the harvesting weather has been unusually good 
another analyst dale benson of dean witter reynolds inc in 
chicago said the rally was also linked to technical buy signals 
especially the february contracts dip below 47 cents a pound 
which triggered largescale buying 
on the livestock markets live cattle futures settled 10 cent 
to 35 cent higher with october at 7320 cents a pound feeder 
cattle were 20 cent to 60 cent higher with october at 8315 cents 
a pound live hogs were 30 cent lower to 40 cent higher with 
october at 4762 cents a pound 
energy futures prices settled mostly higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange in a session dominated by technical factors 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 8 
cents higher with november at 2025 a barrel heating oil was 11 
cent to 22 cent higher with november at 5981 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 26 cent lower to 67 cent higher with 
november at 5573 cents a gallon 
gold futures were slightly higher while silver made substantial 
gains on new yorks commodity exchange analysts said silver was 
due for a correction after sinking 23 cents an ounce in the last 
four sessions 
gold finished 90 cents to 1 higher with october at 362 a troy 
ounce silver was 43 cents to 5 cents higher with december at 
5143 a troy ounce 
most soybean and corn futures advanced slightly on the chicago 
board of trade as traders finetuned their positions ahead of 
thursdays agriculture department crop report 
most wheat futures posted modest losses reflecting a lack of 
new export demand 
the usda crop report scheduled for release after thursdays 
close is expected to indicate slightly larger corn and soybean 
harvests than the usdas september estimates of 189 billion 
bushels of soybeans and 732 billion bushels of corn 
wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 404 a bushel corn futures 
were cent to 1 cents higher with december at 235 a bushel 
oats were cent lower to cent higher with december at 140 a 
bushel soybeans were unchanged to 3 cents higher with november at 
552 a bushel

may department stores co said wednesday it has 
sold its 118 caldor discount stores to an investor group that 
includes senior management and is spinning off its venture discount 
chain in order to concentrate on its higherreturn and 
fastergrowing businesses 
may one of the nations leading department store companies 
said wednesday it had agreed to sell caldor for 500 million cash 
and 52 million in other considerations to cal holdings inc 
cal holdings is a new company formed by odyssey partners lp 
caldor management led by don r clarke chairman and chief 
executive officer marc i balmuth president and others and 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette capital corp 
cal holdings will assume 52 million in caldor debt and 
capitalized lease operations may spokesman jim abrams said 
caldor is located primarily in the northeast 
may which has been trying to sell its two discount operations 
for several months also announced a plan to spin off its venture 
division of 75 discount stores in eight states in the midwest 
plans which are subject to a favorable ruling by the internal 
revenue service call for venture to borrow money which it then 
would pay to may as compensation for separating itself from may 
may would distribute stock in venture to its shareholders 
abrams said 
we have done what we said we were going to do in late june 
abrams said he said he could not place a dollar value on the 
venture spinoff 
analysts however estimate that the venture move will raise 
300 million which they expect may to use for further acquisitions 
in the retail field 
linda kristiansen of dean witter said she had expected the 
caldor and venture moves to provide money for future expansion 
im a little disappointed in the proceeds which should total 
850 million kristiansen said i expected it to come to about 
12 billion but it doesnt change anything clearly theyll be 
in a position to make the acquisitions 
may said it does not currently have a specific use for the money 
from the transactions but it is considering adding more department 
stores or specialty stores repurchasing shares of its stock or 
using the money for other corporate purposes 
besides caldor and venture may owns 14 department store chains 
in 29 states and the district of columbia and 2663 payless shoe 
stores in the northeast

the man who will become procter amp gamble cos 
chairman on jan 2 said wednesday he expects the company to win a 
bigger share of international business and hopes employees increase 
their stake in the company 
we now think of ourselves as a world company thats an 
important cultural change for pampg said edwin l artzt who also 
will assume the post of chief executive of the cincinnatibased 
company weve discovered in the past 10 years that the product 
strategies employed here really can work in other places around the 
world 
pampg says its employees including retirees own 24 percent of 
the companys stock much of it through profitsharing programs 
artzt said employee ownership along with pampgs financial health 
and antitakeover measures it has taken can help guard against 
takeover attempts 
artzt said pampg would like to see its employees holdings grow 
but regarding concerns about takeovers he said i think the 
best thing a company can do is satisfy its shareholders and were 
trying to do that 
artzt 59 who joined procter amp gamble in 1953 and has spent the 
past five years directing pampgs international operations said the 
company hopes to do half its business in overseas markets at some 
point during the 1990s he told a news conference wednesday he 
thinks that goal could grow further 
about 39 percent of pampgs sales in the last fiscal year were 
based outside the united states 
pampg announced to its shareholders meeting tuesday that artzt 
will take over jan 2 for john g smale who will step down as 
chairman and chief executive but continue as an employee and 
director to spend more time with his family smale 62 has been 
with pampg since 1952 
artzt said smale first approached him with the idea early this 
summer 
i was pleasantly surprised artzt said it was never my 
expectation that john would step aside at this point even though 
some of our executives have done that 
from my standpoint its quite a wonderful thing that he would 
step aside and give me a chance to lead this company artzt said 
john e pepper 51 will continue as pampgs president but will 
relinquish most of his responsibility for domestic operations in 
return for succeeding artzt as supervisor of international 
operations artzt praised pepper as a highly capable manager 
i feel very good about having him in what i regard as the 
second most important job in the company artzt said he 
suggested that pepper could have a future shot at the chairmans 
job 
its my time to step up to bat artzt said johns in a 
different generation than i am hell be around after my days are 
over 
artzt said he has no plans now to step aside early as smale is 
doing 
artzt also said he expects to make no dramatic changes in the 
companys direction 
our leader is stepping aside but we intend to continue the 
program that seems to be doing so well artzt said 
procter amp gamble a personalcare and home products company 
earned a company record 16 billion on record worldwide sales of 
214 billion in the fiscal year ended june 30

toyota motor corps us manufacturing capacity 
must increase by twothirds to meet american sales expectations a 
company official said wednesday 
the boost in capacity would come at time that other automakers 
are struggling with too much factory capability 
ford motor co is cutting back on overtime at its plants and 
general motors corp has announced that it will close its lakewood 
assembly plant in atlanta this coming march 
chrysler corp has not ruled out plant closings 
bob mccurry executive vice president for sales of toyota motor 
sales usa inc said he expected the company would sell 15 
million cars and trucks a year in the united states by the 
mid1990s 
half of that sales volume would come from north american plants 
toyota makes cars at its plants in georgetown ky and cambridge 
ontario and at a plant in fremont calif that it shares with gm 
toyota plans to add light truck production to the fremont plant by 
next year 
the plants current capacity for toyota is about 450000 
vehicles a year meaning that capacity for another 300000 vehicles 
is needed 
mccurry speaking at toyotas media introduction of its 1990 
model cars and trucks said production at existing plants could be 
expanded to handle the extra 300000 mostly through the georgetown 
and fremont plants 
its possible said analyst kathleen heaney of nikko 
securities co international inc of new york city they are 
going to do two things they are targeting the midwest and the 
fleet market they can make a big move into that area 
a year ago mccurry said the company was embarking on a program 
to expand its dealer network in the midwest an area of the country 
resistant to japanese cars and trucks on wednesday he said the 
program was working 
mccurry said there are about 1125 toyota dealers nationwide 
now and the company will have add 55 in the midwest by years end 
another 55 are expected to be added in the region next year 
mccurry said the company had established dealerships in most 
midwest metropolitan areas and was heading out of the cities to 
find new dealers 
like other auto company executives mccurry predicted a slower 
sales year in 1990 than in 1989 with somewhere between 14 million 
and 145 million cars and trucks being sold 500000 to 1 million 
fewer vehicles than estimates for the 1989 calendar year 
he also said that 1990 toyota prices would be 21 percent on 
average more than 1989 prices the increase mccurry said was due 
entirely to federally mandated passive restraint systems drivers 
side air bags or automatic seat belts
