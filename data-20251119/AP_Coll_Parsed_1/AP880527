ethiopian guerrillas on thursday claimed 
they captured three garrison towns in northern ethiopia including 
korem the site of a major government food relief station in the 
droughtstricken region 
the towns were taken wednesday according to yemane kidane a 
tigrean liberation peoples front official he said nothing of 
casualties 
yemane said a joint force of the peoples front and the newly 
formed ethiopian peoples democratic movement took korem in wollo 
province while peoples front forces simultaneously captured the 
garrison towns of amba alage and kasad gudu in southern tigre 
province wollos northern neighbor 
the inaccessibility of ethiopias northern region makes 
independent verification of government or rebel claims difficult 
in ethiopias capital addis ababa government spokesman teklu 
tabor refused to comment western sources said they had heard no 
reports of any of the towns falling 
widespread crop failures last year have left 1 million people in 
need of emergency food aid in wollo korem 250 miles north of 
addis ababa has been a major government food distribution station 
government relief workers there have been handing out onemonth 
rations to about 6000 people a day 
fighting in tigre and ethiopias northernmost province eritrea 
has crippled relief operations aimed at feeding an estimated 32 
million drought victims in those provinces there are 7 million 
drought victims nationwide 
yemane said the rebel operation was aimed at thwarting a big 
offensive president mengistu haile mariam is preparing for tigre 
the push started in eritrea and stalled said yemane repeating 
claims made by the eritrean peoples liberation front 
the secessionist eritrean peoples liberation front has been 
fighting for 27 years in africas longest civil war the tigrean 
liberation peoples front took up arms against the addis ababa 
government in 1974 demanding greater autonomy 
mengistu inherited the insurgencies 14 years ago when he with a 
group of army officers overthrew emperor haile selassie the 
government and the two rebel fronts all are marxist 
yemane rejected zambian president kenneth kaundas plea at the 
summit in addis ababa of the organization of african unity that the 
rebels make peace with the government 
there will be no peace in ethiopia unless mengistu is 
destroyed yemane said

the regime of gen manuel noriega has 
used detentions beatings threats and sexual harassment to 
intimidate panamanians and quell what appeared only a month ago to 
be a rising wave of protest 
noriega doesnt have to resort to slayings or to arranging for 
people to disappear as has happened in some latin american 
dictatorships 
panamanians themselves are the first to admit they are 
unaccustomed to violent abuse and are easily cowed by it 
i took part in demonstrations until they detained me said a 
27yearold lawyer who asked not to be named for fear of 
reprisals she was released after a half hour but not before being 
insulted threatened and fondled by policemen 
we are not nicaragua or el salvador or afghanistan we dont 
have violence in our blood said ivan romero secretarygeneral 
of the opposition christian democratic party 
romero was detained interrogated and beaten may 5 when he 
returned from the united states where he had gone to take part in 
a conference he was expelled to miami the next day and allowed to 
return on monday 
there is a triumph of terror he told the associated press 
in an interview the regime is waging psychological war and its 
winning 
the defense forces which includes police and armed forces and 
is under noriegas command did not return repeated telephone calls 
thursday asking for a response to these allegations 
only three people have been killed in political violence since 
the usbacked opposition campaign to oust noriega began 11 months 
ago there are no disappeared the enigmatic status that 
military regimes in south and central america conferred on tens of 
thousands of opponents in past decades 
but there is a secret police g2 whose members have 
demonstrated ruthlessness the corps is informed by street spies 
called toads whose pervasive infiltration of everyday life is 
taken for granted 
were not fighters but a folkloric people beach sun and 
sea said a young professional jailed and mistreated for a week 
last month i myself am that way its in our genes 
the man said he was suspected of opposition activity and taken 
from his home after midnight by several agents to g2 headquarters 
he was stripped and his wrists handcuffed behind his back 
asthmatic and frail he was forced to stand under a cold shower 
for half an hour punched in the face and abdomen and beaten on the 
legs with a rubber hose he reported then he was beaten on the 
toes with a blackjack a pain he describes as terrible 
still nude and handcuffed as he was to remain for 15 hours he 
was thrown into a cell where he was told he would be raped by an 
inmate 
panamanian rights activists say a sexual element to physical or 
psychological abuse of detainees is common they report that 
arrested people are frequently threatened with rape or sodomy 
the young man was not sexually abused he said but when he was 
taken from the cell several hours later he was blindfolded his 
mustache was burned with a lighter and the barrel of a revolver was 
placed at his temple 
they told me the cemetery was just down the road he said 
my life is the university work and my girlfried said the 
man who fears reprisal if his name appears in print those seven 
days were like a parenthesis a long nightmare 
the day after i got out there was a antigovernment march 
i did not even think about going he said 
our security forces are more clever than the argentines of 
the 1970s said alvin weeden a lawyer who in the past year has 
represented dozens of people arrested on political charges fear 
is stronger than cadavers people get used to cadavers but they 
dont get used to fear 
he said that since a failed coup attempt in march the 
prevailing paranoia has spread to the defense forces he said the 
18 officers and soldiers under arrest in connection with the 
attempt have been subjected to treatment as least as humiliating as 
that given civilians 
the officers know that if they cast a funny glance at noriega 
or one of his inner circle they will be under surveillance 
themselves said weeden 
theres even more fear inside the armed forces than outside 
he said 
except for the coup plotters political detainees are rarely 
held more than a few days or a week most are required to pay 
between 150 and 350 for their freedom though payments of up to 
10000 have been reported 
opposition leaders and human rights activists call the payments 
ransoms 
weeden thinks the lull in protest and street demonstrations is 
passing a valley to be followed by a surge 
romero said he came back to panama even though his wife pleaded 
with him by telephone not to 
im showing my face and going ahead to help smash the 
terror he said

mathias rust the west german aviator who a year 
ago slipped across one of the worlds most secure borders and 
landed a plane at red square remains jailed at lefortovo prison 
with hopes fading for an early release 
the dramatic may 28 1987 flight shook the foundation of soviet 
security and oiled the way for the ouster of defense minister 
sergei l sokolov and air defense chief alexander koldunov but 
soviet citizens still grin at the audacity of the young pilot and 
his success in putting one over on the mighty kremlin 
soviet jets scrambled when rust crossed into restricted airspace 
over the republic of estonia but the soviet air defense forces 
took no action to halt the flight 
then with apparently no warning to security forces in the 
nations capital the singleengine cessna swept toward the heart 
of soviet power and buzzed kremlin landmarks such as lenins tomb 
and spassky tower 
rust now 20 was sentenced sept 4 to four years at a 
generalregime labor camp on charges of malicious mischief by 
mutual consent with the soviet government he is serving his time 
at the infamous lefortovo prison in eastern moscow which in the 
past contained american journalist nicholas daniloff and u2 pilot 
francis gary powers 
a source close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said rust asked to remain at lefortovo rather than transfer to a 
less restrictive penal institution because the littleused kgb 
facility is more easily accessible to his parents and west german 
diplomats who are allowed to make regular visits 
at lefortovo rust has been allowed more visits than he is 
officially entitled to his parents karlheinz and monika rust 
and his 16yearold brother ingo have visited lefortovo at least 
five times since june under soviet corrections regulations 
prisoners are allowed one visit every three months 
a representative of the west german embassy is allowed to visit 
once each month to bring mail books and special foods to augment 
the prison diet 
rusts appeal of his fouryear sentence was turned down late 
last year 
the young amateur pilot from suburban hamburg has issued a 
personal request for clemency that does not require a formal reply 
to date there has been no reply 
soviet officials have commented privately that rust will likely 
serve at least half of his term to show that the kremlin does not 
take such stunts lightly and to discourage any similar incidents in 
the future 
rust was accused during his twoday trial of endangering the 
lives of thousands of airline passengers when he piloted his 
borrowed cessna 172b from helsinki finland through the flight 
paths of foreign airliners headed for moscows sheremetyevo airport 
witnesses testified that he could have injured some of the 
hundreds of pedestrians at red square on the cool sunny evening 
when he landed 
rust told the court he felt remorse and deep repentance and 
never intended to endanger or insult anyone 
before landing in the square rust piloted his blue and white 
craft at a low altitude through more than 500 miles of closely 
guarded soviet territory 
the dramatic stunt was followed by a shortlived moment of glory 
for rust as tourists and muscovites crowded around the plane that 
came to a rest between st basils cathedral and the redbrick wall 
surrounding the kremlin they asked for the pilots autograph and 
took his picture as he reclined against the fuselage before his 
arrest 
less than 48 hours later the ruling politburo met in special 
session and sent sokolov into retirement and fired koldunov for 
negligence

three years after the original 1904 walters art 
gallery closed for a 6 million overhaul baltimores renaissance 
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate 
henry walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art 
collections in the world 
the renovation has created for walters precious jewels 
bronzes paintings and sculpture what gallery director robert p 
bergman calls a seamless museum environment that is easy on the 
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history 
in a lot of ways we think the public is going to see the 
collection for the first time bergman said recently pointing 
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure 
viewers we direct people directly to the object through the 
lighting 
the massive stone building with a marblecolumned court 
fashioned after the 17thcentury palazzo balbi in genoa italy is 
one of six comprehensive museums in the united states walters 
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931 along with the 
22000piece collection 
the leaking roof blackened marble drab painted walls and 
poorly lighted rooms bergman inherited when he left an art history 
post at harvard university and arrived here are gone in their 
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring 
gleaming stone rich silk moire red blue and gold cotton damask 
polished woods glass lucite and plaster the works themselves 
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden 
for centuries 
the renovated gallery holds some of the 30000object collection 
spanning 5000 years of history a 1974 addition that stayed open 
during the renovation holds many of the works while thousands more 
lie in storage 
walters who made his fortune with the atlantic coast line 
railroad left the collection along with a 3 million endowment 
to his native city for the benefit of the people 
the works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving 
14thcentury italian perspective paintings called view of an 
ideal city an early lifesize italian crucifix from the school 
of cimabue the first raphael madonna to come to america and one of 
only 12 known paintings by hugo van der goes 
now however their future is assured by a climate and 
lightcontrolled environment that is so hightech that special 
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights 
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent 
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces 
bergman jokingly calls the project a modest calling 
we wanted to create the finest facility possible for this 
collection of renaissance baroque and 18thcentury paintings and 
sculpture and decorative arts he said 
to do that was a special project the building is a work of 
art we had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark 
structure said the medievalist who moved from the rarified 
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as 
ceaseless champion of his worldclass museum 
bergman is satisfied with the effort financed with 1 million 
in city funds 1 million in state funds and another 4 million in 
contributions in fact he considers the workmanship he got for the 
money a bargain pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches 
original woods and marblepainted sculpture bases mimic the marble 
columns for a consistent look 
going room to room bergman marvels at the miraculously 
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for marie 
antoinette a collection of european porcelains considered second 
only to the british royal collection at windsor castle and some of 
the nearly 1000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient 
egypt to art nouveau 
the installation includes a 19thcentury alcove modeled on a 
french goldsmiths shop for walters delicate faberge enamels an 
iris corsage ornament created by tiffany and co and an ivory 
orchid comb by lalique 
the gallery went up between 1904 and 1909 and before walters 
death he would open the doors a few times a month charge 
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father 
who began the collection had done 
more recently the gallery has been drawing 150000 to 200000 
visitors a year including 1500 museum members who celebrated the 
official opening on may 15 the first visitors to the reopened 
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors 
seasoned by a lifetime of trips 
one after another they stopped bergman to thank him for 
restoring the collection to splendor 
just hearing these people convinces me we did the right 
thing he said

gen manuel antonio noriegas speech 
to the national assembly thursday was a mixture of defiance 
nationalism and a brand of patriotic populism that has 
characterized panamanian military leadership for two decades 
noriega under us indictments on drug trafficking charges had 
been expected to give a status report on negotiations with the 
united states to end the hostile faceoff between the two countries 
but he dealt little with the talks which appear to have 
collapsed and concentrated instead on panamanian sovereignty the 
general suggested that american politicians look to problems and 
ethical issues at home before trying to solve them in panama 
noriega also accused american presidential candidates of using 
the panamanian flag to win votes 
here are some excepts from the speech and a questionandanswer 
period that followed 
pardon the ignorance but we cannot understand how these rich 
candidates in the united states dont use the flag to solve the 
problems of the blacks in new york of the poorer classes of the 
minorities of those who have no heat of the foreigners those 
are pretty themes for democracies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the theme of panama is going to constitute a source of 
propaganda for candidates who wish to hide their own problems for 
candidates who wish to bury files that weigh down on the backs of 
that democracy

there was never a trick there was never a lie the lies came 
from the united states the trick never came from panama nor from

directly there can be no negotiations because there must be 
conversations respecting with dignity the sovereignty 
respecting the right of selfdetermination of panamanians the 
suspension of economic aggression the departure of troops beyond 
those called for in the panama canal treaties and respect for 
the constitutional decision by the panamanian parliament that 
manuel solis palma is the president of the republic

federal officials plan to sue los angeles 
county for violating the voting rights of racial minorities by 
diluting their influence when county supervisors redrew district 
boundaries in 1981 a source said thursday 
assistant attorney general william bradford reynolds informed 
the county by letter last week that he authorized the justice 
department to sue the county for allegedly discriminating against 
minorities in the 1981 reapportionment said the source who is 
familiar with the case but asked not to be identified 
the board of supervisors must remap its five districts every 
decade and to divide the population evenly among them but the 1981 
plan allegedly diluted the influence of hispanics and other 
minorities the source added 
county counsel dewitt clinton was called for comment thursday 
but didnt immediately return the call 
there has not been a hispanic supervisor in los angeles countys 
138year history the countys only black supervisor yvonne 
brathwaite burke was appointed to the board in the 1970s and 
subsequently lost a bid for election 
according to the 1980 federal census there were more than 2 
million hispanics and 943000 blacks among the countys 75 million 
residents by 1985 there were 24 million hispanics and 964000 
blacks according to projections by the county department of health 
services 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade confirmed 
reynolds who heads the justice departments civil rights division 
sent a letter to the county last week but said she couldnt 
comment on its contents 
in voting rights cases such letters are sent to allow the 
target of a potential lawsuit to negotiate with the justice 
department and avoid the cost and time of litigation which 
doesnt help anybody she said by phone from washington 
however if statutory violations cannot be resolved then 
certainly litigation is a real possibility 
asked what kind of relief the government seeks in such cases 
ms burstionwade replied the relief would be to protect 
minorities from disenfranchisement 
raul nunez president of the los angeles county chicano 
employees association said he understood the federal complaint 
against the county would involve alleged discrimination against 
hispanics 
we have always felt that the latino community has been without 
power in that they have been fragmented and they have not been 
able to exercise their voting ability nunez said 
we are aware that county counsel has received a letter from 
the department of justice deane dana chairman of the board of 
supervisors said in a statement he is reviewing it and will be 
advising the board until that process is complete we will not 
have any comment beyond that 
bradfords letter first was revealed publicly in thursday 
editions of the los angeles times which cited anonymous sources 
the justice department filed a similar lawsuit in 1985 that 
forced the los angeles city council to shift a district from the 
san fernando valley to the citys largely hispanic east side the 
suit led to the election to the city council of former 
assemblywoman gloria molina 
the justice department based its 1985 complaint on the 1965 
voting rights act which prohibits redistricting that causes 
minority residents to have less opportunity than other members 
of the community to participate in the political process and to 
elect representatives of their choice 
the lawsuit claimed that the citys 1982 plan splintered the 
political influence of hispanics by spreading them thinly over many 
districts

congress is moving with unusual speed toward 
final approval of a 11 trillion federal budget for the 1989 
fiscal year thanks to a little bipartisan cooperation and a lot of 
creative arithmetic 
the house approved the spending plan by a 201181 vote on 
thursday shortly after housesenate negotiators reached agreement 
on a compromise document after six weeks of haggling 
the senate is expected to give quick approval to the measure 
after the chamber returns early next month from its memorial day 
recess 
the budget meets the spending ceilings for domestic defense and 
international affairs programs set at last falls budget summit by 
president reagan and congressional leaders 
it also obeys the grammrudman balanced budget laws 146 
billion deficit target for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 if the 
red ink grows beyond that level the law calls for automatic 
spending cuts to reduce the deficit to 136 billion 
this i believe is a balanced approach said house budget 
committee chairman william h gray iii dpa 
the numbers used in the document were shoehorned into the budget 
summit and grammrudman limits by lawmakers intent on avoiding 
fights over spending and taxes in an election year 
the legislators used relatively rosy economic assumptions 
produced by the white house rather than more pessimistic 
projections calculated by the congressional budget office as the 
economy worsens government spending grows and its revenue shrinks 
producing more red ink 
in addition when their numbers threatened to spill over the 
budget summits constraints the lawmakers fiddled slightly with 
the definitions of the spending categories they used allowing them 
to claim they had abided by their pact with the white house 
even with that craftiness the budget might still surpass the 
146 billion limit set by grammrudman 
the law requires a fresh look at the spending plans projected 
deficit in august using updated readings of the economys 
performance 
rep delbert latta rohio said james miller iii director of 
the white houses office of management and budget had told him 
thursday that it would be a miracle if the automatic spending 
cuts are avoided 
despite that warning 26 republicans joined 175 democrats in 
voting for the measure 
final congressional approval early next month would be unusually 
quick the legislators however already have upheld their annual 
tradition of missing the april 15 deadline set in law for 
completing the budget 
the measure contains 2995 billion in new defense spending 
181 billion for international affairs and 148 billion for 
domestic programs for 1989 
the pentagons 81 billion increase over spending this year is 
below the amount needed to keep pace with inflation 
education health social services and job training programs 
would all be given enough money to match inflation increases some 
other programs including aids research and treatment antidrug 
initiatives space and air traffic control would be boosted 
enough to surpass the costs of inflation 
the electionyear measure would allow an additional 14 billion 
in antidrug spending later this year if congress and the white 
house decide that an emergency exists the extra money would have 
to be covered by spending reductions in other areas or by new 
revenues 
in legislation passed in december 14 billion in new taxes for 
fiscal 1989 already have been written into law the budget approved 
thursday includes no other additional revenues 
the two chambers had differences of about 1 billion small 
ones in budget terms over how much money should be spent for 
science space and education 
in their compromise the lawmakers agreed to 13 billion for 
space and science and 372 billion for education 
they also agreed to a 4 percent pay raise for military personnel 
and federal civilian employees to take effect in january 
the raise would apply to members of congress who already earn 
89500 annually if included in forthcoming appropriations bills 
members of congress would earn 93080 a year a raise of 3580 
the budget does not require the presidents signature and is 
used as a guideline by congress as it passes the 13 appropriations 
bills that actually provide money for federal spending 
but this year its value seems even more questionable than usual 
because the two chambers have already begun work on their spending 
measures

soviet experts accused the united states 
of undermining progress on a global chemical weapons ban but still 
expressed optimism that 20 years of talks would soon culminate in 
an agreement 
leaders of the 13member soviet delegation told a news 
conference that the talks sorely need a political initiative from 
soviet american and british leaders 
however just days before mikhail s gorbachev and president 
reagan get together in moscow for their fourth summit the soviet 
chemical weapons experts took a tough line against us resumption 
of chemical weapons production 
such steps undoubtedly run counter to the aims of a chemical 
warfare convention said yuri nazarkin chief soviet negotiator 
at the 40nation geneva conference on disarmament where the 
chemical weapons ban talks have been taking place 
the news conference thursday ended the soviets threeday visit 
here the first time they have been at a chemical warfare facility 
in western europe 
lt gen anatoly kuntsevich deputy commander of the soviets 
chemical troops said current us production of binary weapons 
in which elements that are harmless on their own become lethal when 
combined is dangerous uncontrollable and unverifiable 
he said the us decision to end an 18year moratorium on 
chemical weapons production last december raised soviet suspicions 
that america plans to supply binary weapons to its nato allies 
still nazarkin appeared more optimistic than his british 
counterpart at the geneva talks ambassador tessa solesby that a 
verifiable agreement on the development production and stockpiling 
of chemical weapons can be reached soon 
the international negotiations in geneva have actually entered 
the decisive stage of development we firmly believe that this 
convention will be achievable soon nazarkin said 
in order to overcome the differences that still remain he 
said what we need is impetuses to solve the problems at a 
political level not a technical level 
but solesby said getting reagan gorbachev and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher to give the negotiations a political 
push will not solve the main problem of verification 
it is not a matter of lack of political will its the 
technical difficulties that remain she said 
the soviets and their british hosts stressed the historic 
significance of the threeday visit to britains chemical warfare 
defense center at porton down in southwest england 
but they disagreed on the size of the soviet stockpile and the 
wisdom of setting a timetable for reaching a final agreement 
nazarkin said the successful outcome of negotiations depends 
on a time limit to settle and tackle all the unresolved problems 
solesby said we do not feel artificial time limits are 
helpful 
gorbachev said last year that the soviet union has a 50000ton 
stockpile western estimates have put it at 300000 tons 
nazarkin insisted the soviets had not lied about the size of 
their stockpile and said inspectors may see it as soon as an 
agreement is signed he accused the united states of inflating 
their estimates to justify the start of binary weapons production 
he said the soviet stockpile was now at parity with the american 
stockpile which he also estimated at 50000 tons 
but nazarkin expressed concern that us binary weapons 
production could change the balance the americans have not 
disclosed the size of their stockpile but western estimates put it 
at 30000 tons 
solesby said america started producing binary weapons to counter 
soviet production and replace its own aging stockpiles 
during their visit to the 7000acre porton down facility the 
soviets held wideranging talks with british experts and watched 
british soldiers respond to a simulated enemy nerve gas attack 
in july a british delegation will visit the chemical warfare 
facility at shikhany in eastern russia 
last october specialists from the geneva conference visited 
shikhany where they were shown chemical weapons which seemed to 
date from the 1950s the following month soviet inspectors visited 
a us army chemical weapons disposal plant at toole utah where 
they were shown techniques for destroying old gas munitions

more than threefourths of the workers who 
lost their jobs to plant closings or mass layoffs last year did not 
have new jobs lined up when they went off their companies 
payrolls according to new government data 
of the 406887 victims of plant closings or large layoffs in 29 
states in 1987 78 percent or 319343 filed claims for 
unemployment insurance benefits the labor department said thursday 
the government tracked those people through state employment 
offices and found that 85548 or more than onefourth of them 
exhausted their unemployment benefits an average 139 a week with 
a 26week maximum in most states before finding new work 
the report was hailed by advocates of the 60day advance notice 
requirement that president reagan cited as a major reason why he 
vetoed the 1000page trade bill on tuesday 
with that kind of advance notice many of these people would 
have had an opportunity to seek new jobs while currently employed 
and would likely not have had to draw unemployment insurance 
said john zaluskey an economist for the aflcio 
the advance notice provision was approved by congress after 
surveys by the labor department and the general accounting office 
showed that two of every three us workers caught up in such 
layoffs get no warning 
the national academy of sciences said in a report last year that 
the reagan administrations reliance on voluntary notices is 
not providing workers with the best practice minimum of two 
or three months to adjust successfully to job loss 
the academy estimated that advance layoff notices would reduce 
by 25 percent the time a laidoff employee is out of work saving 
hundreds of millions of dollars in unemployment benefits 
reagan however said when he vetoed the trade bill that the 
layoff notice requirements would cost jobs and damage our 
economic growth 
business groups supportive of the bill in general had urged 
reagan to veto the measure because of the layoff provision which 
us chamber of commerce president richard lesher called the 
camels nose under the tent in a broad union agenda for more 
government control in the work place 
the house on tuesday immediately overrode reagans veto with 
democrats rejoicing that reagan had given them an issue for 
rallying voters in the november election 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis said reagan 
and vice president george bush dont understand that for working 
families there is nothing more painful than losing a job 
the senate which passed the trade bill on a 6336 vote that was 
short of what would be needed to override reagans veto was 
expected to take up the measure again early next month 
the report thursday by the labor departments bureau of labor 
statistics was the first comprehensive examination of the mass 
layoff phenomenon ever released by the government 
congress in 1983 ordered government statisticians to start 
conducting the survey after the nations unemployment rate soared 
to 114 percent and the rolls of the unemployed grew to 125 
million during the first two years of reagans administration 
since then the jobless rate has dropped to 54 percent the 
lowest since 1974 with fewer than 7 million people now out of 
work in the longest peacetime economic expansion in us history 
of the 29 states surveyed in 1987 two texas and wisconsin 
accounted for onefourth of the total layoffs five other states 
louisiana minnesota new jersey new york and pennsylvania 
accounted for another fourth 
the 29 states were alabama arizona arkansas indiana iowa 
kansas louisiana maine massachusetts minnesota mississippi 
missouri montana nebraska nevada new hampshire new jersey new 
mexico new york north carolina oklahoma pennsylvania south 
carolina texas utah vermont virginia washington and wisconsin 
slack or seasonal work was listed by employers in the 
survey as accounting for about half of the layoffs the other 
biggest reasons cited for them by employers were completion of 
contracts 7 percent business ownership changes 4 percent and 
import competition 2 percent

for the first time in its uniquely american 
history ringling bros and barnum and bailey circus is staging a 
colossal threering assault on the land of sushi and sumo wrestling 
we are coming to entertain you boomed jim holst the shows 
associate producer and former ringmaster at a tokyo news 
conference thursday 
flanked by five clowns two jungling acrobats and a hulahoop 
artist he smiled and intoned it is our hope and our interest 
that you will smile and laugh and hide your eyes in fear 
for 15 weeks starting in july japanese kids of all ages will be 
dazzled by daring trapeze acts animal tamers 25 clowns 16 
elephants 14 lions and assorted camels llamas dogs and 
chimpanzees under a big top 
coordinating transpacific transportation for beasts about 300 
humans and 100 tractortrailer loads of lighting and sound 
equipment and supplies in the circus first overseas trip are 
enough to astound 
holst estimates ringling bros spent at least 10 million for 
the production 
the big top goes up this summer in sapporo tokyo and osaka 
organizers hope to attract as many as 12 million japanese and 
already are planning a 25week run in japan next year 
we are not interested in the shortterm profit said joseph 
gold ringling marketing supervisor we want to build a 
tradition the japanese public may have seen a circus before but 
theyve never the greatest show on earth 
japanese got a sneak preview this week when ringlings 
promotional team unleased the clowns jugglers and hulahoopist in 
full costume on the streets and television airwaves of tokyo 
humor is universal said bluehaired christopher hudert 
whose nose was painted red at first people are kind of 
surprised but they really like slapstick 
the ringmaster will continue to herald the acts in english 
hoping japanese audiences will pay close attention to his arm as he 
points to the various rings 
acts among the 130member troop will include the human 
cannonball and the globe of death in which two men on motorcycles 
race simultaneously inside a large chainlink ball sometimes with 
their wives standing in the middle 
we dont know if what were bringing will offend people 
gold acknowledged like today the japanese sponsor wanted to 
take the clowns around to some newspapers i said why dont you 
take four and ill take one with me 
he said no in japan four is an unlucky number it means 
death gold said he shrugged and raised his eyebrows i didnt 
know that 
ticket prices will run 40 a head about the cost of a ticket 
to a rock concert here compared with a maximum of 12 in the 
united states 
we cost maybe twice the price of a movie gold said but 
where else can you see 250 people and animals risking their lives

conventional wisdom says president reagan and 
mikhail s gorbachev will benefit politically by the moscow summit 
but conventional wisdom isnt infallible 
consider the following 
reagan is enormously popular at home but as he prepares to 
leave office little of that support appears to be transferring to 
vice president george bush 
gorbachev faces problems at home but most stem from his 
stumbling efforts to reform soviet society his rivals on the 
ruling politburo appear to agree on the need to improve relations 
with the united states reduce international tension and fix the 
soviet economy it is the nature speed and consequences of the fix 
that divide them say the experts 
open elections and reliable public opinion polls are still a 
thing of the future in the soviet union and instead western 
analysts will be watching a communist party conference at the end 
of june to determine how much confidence gorbachev inspires in his 
countrymen 
numbers if not answers are easier to come by in the united 
states opinion polls show americans overwhelmingly back arms 
control agreements if they are negotiated carefully 
a survey this month in the bipartisan americans talk security 
series said 77 percent of those polled backed the treaty to 
eliminate mediumrange missiles the treaty signed by reagan and 
gorbachev at their washington meeting last december now appears 
headed for senate ratification in time for the moscow summit 
the survey said 82 percent backed a strategic arms reduction 
treaty to cut superpower strategic arsenals by half 
gorbachev and reagan both say a start deal is possible by the 
end of the year but they remain divided over us plans for a 
missile defense system verification issues and limits on heavy 
landbased missiles and air and submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
reagans success in bargaining with the soviets to date may 
improve his treatment in history books but it does not seem to 
help bush who according to a cbsnew york times poll last week was 
trailing the probable democratic nominee michael dukakis the poll 
gave dukakis 49 percent to bushs 39 percent an abcwashington 
post poll this week gave dukakis 53 percent and bush 40 percent 
one prominent bush supporter rep jim leach riowa said that 
the vice president is going to be running on a very powerful 
peace and prosperity platform but the american people have found 
that so successful that they are looking at other issues the very 
success of the republicans has bred a public nonchalance to the big 
issues of our time 
critics of the republican administration attribute progress in 
arms control to gorbachev rather than to reagan who entered office 
declaring that the soviets had broken every treaty they had signed 
with the united states 
one of the calling cards of the reagan administration is that 
these people have brought the soviets into line by setting out 
tough policies and sticking to them said jack mendelsohn deputy 
director of the arms control association a liberal washington 
group 
but thats not what happened said mendelsohn gorbachev he 
said changed because he decided it was in the best soviet 
interests 
opinion polls indicate broad support for reagans approach 
the americans talk security survey showed that 68 percent of 
those polled favored caution in dealing with the soviets compared 
with 28 percent who advocated seizing the opportunity presented by 
gorbachev 
gorbachev may be losing his fight to stack the june party 
conference in his favor said walter laqueur and thanne gustafson 
of the center for strategic and international studies in washington 
of the 5000 delegates to the conference said laqueur 3500 
will be made up of government and party officials thought to oppose 
gorbachevs reform efforts and most of the rest are being selected 
to regional party organizations many of them also hostile to 
gorbachev 
the outlook is for a conservative membership said 
gustafson and that could stymie gorbachevs perceived drive to win 
a comfortable majority on the central committee the policymaking 
body which until now has put the brakes on his more radical ideas

the securities and exchange commission is 
declaring its independence from the reagan administration by 
pushing its own proposals in the regulatory turf war that has 
followed the october stock market crash 
a sharply divided commission voted 32 to ask congress for 
jurisdiction over the stock index futures markets in chicago an 
area now regulated by a sister agency the commodity futures 
trading commission 
members voting for the proposal noted that the sec already 
regulates the trading of stocks and stock options and said that it 
was only logical that the sec also oversee trading of futures 
contracts based on stocks 
the sec has already lost on the issue in an interagency working 
group formed to develop administration policy on market reform the 
panel whose members represented the treasury department federal 
reserve board sec and cftc issued a report last week calling for 
no major legislative initiatives 
democrats in congress reacted with dismay to the working groups 
recommendations which all but preclude the chances of a market 
bill this year sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the 
senate banking committee called them pitiful 
however the secs move to stake out an independent position 
pleased democrats looking for a means to rekindle sentiment for 
change 
the sec today distinguished itself from the donothing 
strategists of the rest of this administration said rep edward 
j markey dmass chairman of the house subcommittee with 
jurisdiction over the stock markets 
the sec has demonstrated intelligence courage and common 
sense he said in a statement aides to markey are drafting a 
bill that would transfer jurisdiction of equityrelated futures 
from the commodity commission to the sec 
however two members of the sec do not want that authority 
commission member edward h fleischman argued that each commission 
was best qualified to oversee the separate markets 
we come from different backgrounds we wear different 
spectacles he said 
commission member joseph a grundfest said he agreed with the 
goal of more consistent regulation but said that seeking to take 
over part of the commodity commissions jurisdiction would only 
cause rancor and provoke a firestorm in congress where 
separate committees oversee the two agencies 
i think we could have and should have proceeded on the path of 
cooperation that could have gotten us a lot of what we wanted to 
achieve we have instead embarked on a path i would describe as 
regulatory imperialism he said 
however commission chairman david s ruder said that sec 
control of stock and stock futures regulation flows logically from 
the recommendations of an earlier presidential task force composed 
of members of the financial community the socalled brady task 
force headed by investment banker nicholas f brady said the 
futures and stock markets are economically one 
i think its time we move to what i think is a rational way of 
regulating that interlinked market ruder said he was supported 
by commissioners charles c cox and aulana l peters 
the sec voted unanimously to offer four other recommendations to 
congress and decided to withhold one for futher discussion 
in one the sec said it should have emergency power to call 
trading halts delay the opening of markets or close them early 
the commission would have to seek permission from the president of 
the united states to continue a trading halt beyond 24 hours and 
the president would have the power to overturn any emergency action 
by the sec 
if enacted the emergency authority would reverse the current 
arrangement which requires the sec to seek presidential permission 
before calling a trading halt 
the commission also asked for authority to require the reporting 
of securities trades of larger than 5 million that is intended to 
make it easier for the agency to track index arbitrage a form of 
computer trading involving the simultaneous sale of large groups of 
stocks and futures contracts

us intelligence satellites took months in 1983 
to find a site in siberia where the soviets were building an early 
warning radar system in violation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty 
the incident illustrates the difficulties of monitoring arms 
control deals an issue at the heart of debate over the treaty 
signed at the summit last december to eliminate mediumrange 
nuclear missiles 
the discussion will become even more heated as the two sides 
discuss a proposed strategic arms reduction treaty to slash longer 
range arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
despite the unprecedented onsite inspection provisions of the 
intermediaterange nuclear force pact to monitor it we are going 
to rely about 95 percent on national technical means or 
satellites and listening stations said former arms control 
negotiator john rhinelander 
the task is complex said the chairman of the senate 
intelligence committee sen david boren dokla because if you 
are going to hide a missile you are very unlikely to hide it in a 
site where other side has the right of onsite inspection you are 
going to put it somewhere else where it is concealed 
on the question of test monitoring a congressional scientific 
study said thursday that seismic technology is sensitive enough to 
confidently monitor all but the smallest soviet underground nuclear 
tests 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev are 
expected to sign a pair of protocols designed to improve test 
monitoring procedures 
the study by the office of technology assessment an arm of 
congress said seismology now provides a means to monitor 
underground nuclear explosions down to low yields even when 
strenuous attempts are made to evade the monitoring systems 
but finding hidden missiles appears to be beyond the 
capabilities of the two kh11 photographic satellites the united 
states is thought to have in orbit now 
to fill the gap reagan on may 17 approved a compromise with 
boren who had been seeking billions of dollars in additional money 
over several years to boost the number and quality of us spy 
satellites 
soviet defectors among them alexei myagov and viktor suvorov 
have said the soviets track us intelligence satellites and try to 
fool them by covering up sensitive activities or by deploying dummy 
armaments 
and the kremlin has made similar allegations about the united 
states 
in the 1970s the soviets were irked to find that us 
maintenance workers had covered minutemen missile silos with tents 
blocking them from satellite inspection in violation of arms 
control accords 
the us side said it was raining probably it was flooding 
because the tents stayed up for three months said valentin 
falin a nonvoting member of the soviet communist party central 
committee and frequent spokesman on us relations 
falin interviewed recently in washington cited the tent 
incident as an example of the need for trust in verifying arms 
control accords 
boren said the soviets have little incentive to cheat on the 
pact eliminating their 707 mediumrange missiles which are kept at 
known sites 
but he said when you get to start where you are reducing 
down by maybe 5000 missiles you have a much higher incentive to 
cheat because of the difficulty in many kinds of weapons spread 
across the soviet union 
our means are not adequate to cope with that kind of demand 
without some substantial modernization and upgrading boren said 
in an interview 
the amount of the spending increase and the exact hardware 
sought by boren is classified but he says i am not just talking 
numerically i am talking qualitatively as well 
one likely improvement would be radarimaging satellites able 
to peer through clouds and darkness 
remember our technical means are not just charged with 
verifying arms control agreements boren said we also have to 
keep up with what is going on in around the world we have other 
needs such as monitoring events in the persian gulf keeping 
track of conventional forces in europe and around the globe and 
watching weapons tests 
former intelligence committee staff member angelo codevilla 
argues that america needs more and better satellites to provide 
targeting information on two new classes of soviet mobile missiles 
the ss24 and ss25 
what we have now is good for looking at places of known 
interest with means that are themselves known and that have very 
limited areas coverage said codevilla now at the hoover 
institute in california 
in the 20 minutes it would take an icbm to fly from america to 
russia a mobile missile could be moved out of the intended blast 
area 
the united states said codevilla needs to monitor soviet 
missile sites around the clock to be able to change the course of 
missiles in flight 
william arkin of the institute for policy analysis in 
washington said that the overall product delivered by the 
satellites is in a nutshell not very good 
the exchange of information between us and soviet negotiators 
has produced far more information on russian weapons systems than 
intelligence collection said arkin 
for example before the exchange of data in the inf 
negotiations said arkin the pentagon estimated the number of 
ss20s at 441 and the number of ss23s at 20 soviet data provided 
last december put the figures at 405 ss20s and 102 ss23s 
including one battery never spotted by us intelligence

new estimates by the agriculture department 
put the value of us agricultural exports at a fouryear high of 
335 billion this fiscal year up from 279 billion in 198687 
actual quantities of shipments may reach 1455 million metric 
tons up from 1292 million tons last year the usda said thursday 
export values dropped to a decade low of 263 billion two years 
ago but improved slightly to 279 billion in 198687 the tonnage 
of shipments dropped to 1095 million tons in 198586 before 
recovering in 198687 
despite this years gains the current estimates are still far 
below the record of 438 billion and 1623 million tons in 198081 
before world economic conditions high interest rates foreign 
competition a rising value of the us dollar and other factors 
triggered the slide 
the new foreast also was up by 1 billion and 3 million tons 
from usdas previous estimate on feb 25 
officials attributed the boost to a growth in animal products 
horticultural products and soybeans the boost in tonnage 
reflects improved prospects for wheat feed ingredients and 
soybeans the report said 
the value of animal products was boosted 600 million from the 
february forecast to a record of 56 billion this year due to 
strongerthanexpected demand for hides red meats and animal 
fats the report said 
most of the increase in volume stems from larger grain exports 
as the export enhancement program and tighter competitor supplies 
boost the us share of world markets the report said also 
higher prices are expected for grains oilseeds and cotton 
under the eep arrangement selected countries including the 
soviet union and china have been getting wheat and other 
designated commodities at prices subsidized by the us government 
imports of agricultural products this fiscal year were forecast 
at a record 21 billion up 500 million from the february 
estimate last years imports dropped slightly to 206 billion 
from 209 billion in 198586 the previous high mark 
but as a result of export values climbing more rapidly the us 
agricultural trade balance the difference between exports and 
imports is expected to rise sharply to 125 billion from 73 
billion last year 
however the 198788 balance would still be far less than the 
191 billion edge us farm exports had over imports in 198384

ronald d plowman says he has no plans to 
carry out a massive reorganization of the agriculture departments 
primary science agency the agricultural research service 
plowman who will collect an estimated 126500 a year to head 
up the agency has been rumored as having been tabbed to revamp the 
agency including the pruning of a number of highlevel jobs 
but plowman who is head of the department of animal dairy and 
veterinary sciences at utah state university told the associated 
press on thursday that he has no such intentions 
theyve been reorganized to death he said were going to 
work with what weve got 
plowmans usda job appointment was announced on april 15 by 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng at a salary of 77500 a year 
it was subsequently disclosed however that plowman who 
retired from the usda agency in 1984 after 27 years to go to work 
for utah state will be on loan from the university under a lawful 
arrangement that will permit him to continue drawing his federal 
retirement income estimated at 35000 a year additionally he 
will get 14000 a year in per diem to help with relocation and the 
higher costs of living in washington 
technically the university will pay plowmans 77500 salary as 
head of the usda agency but the department then will reimburse 
utah state for that amount 
however if plowman 59 at some point in the future decides to 
rejoin usda permanently he will have to give up his retirement 
income at least until retiring again from the federal government

a decision by the agriculture department to 
loosen up acreage controls on 1989 wheat production indicates the 
united states intends to be a grain seller not a grain storer 
says the president of the national association of wheat growers 
frank johannsen a bayard neb wheat farmer referred in a 
statement released thursday to an earlier usda announcement that 
producers would be required to idle no more than 10 percent of 
their wheat base acreage to qualify for 1989 program benefits the 
acreage setaside was 275 percent for 1988 
but johannsen said the smaller landidling requirement 
requires a continuing federal commitment to operate the export 
enchancement program or eep which has helped reduce surplus us 
wheat stockpiles 
under eep selected foreign countries including the soviet 
union and china have been able to buy huge quantities of wheat at 
subsidized prices 
we intend to work closely with usda and the congress to see 
that existing export assistance programs are used effectively and 
that the past oversupply of wheat not be allowed to reoccur he 
said 
for 50 years and often to its detriment the united states 
has held virtually all the worlds surplus grain johannsen 
added with the 1989 wheat program we shift that burden to our 
competitors

fourteen years ago anna rosnovsky and 
her sister elena keisskuna applied together to leave the soviet 
union only one got out 
the others struggle for an emigration visa is a poignant symbol 
of the human rights issue to be raised in the moscow summit next 
week 
in separate interviews the two sisters sounded the same note of 
skepticism about the soviet commitment to improve conditions for 
soviet jews despite sharply rising emigration figures 
we are hostages we are like goods for sale in the political 
negotiations between the united states and the soviet union mrs 
keisskuna 46 said in an interview in leningrad last month 
gorbachev sells human rights but it is not cheap for him 
said mrs rosnovsky 48 who brought her campaign on behalf of her 
sister to helsinki on thursday 
president reagan is in helsinki until sunday to rest and prepare 
for the summit mrs rosnovsky an israeli came to the finnish 
capital as part of a delegation sponsored by the us national 
conference on soviet jewry to draw public attention to the issue 
mrs keisskunas name is on a list which includes as many as 
300 soviet jews that the united states want to bring to the 
attention of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev said mrs 
rosnovsky a violinist with the israeli philharmonic orchestra 
she showed a reporter a march 1 letter from secretary of state 
george p shultz in which shultz pledged to persist in our 
efforts to make the soviets live up to their human rights 
obligations but he cautioned i cannot offer you any specific 
encouragement in the case of your family 
she said that on monday her sister and another leningrad 
activist were stopped from boarding a train for moscow where they 
were invited to meet reagan along with several dozen other 
refuseniks or jews denied exit visas 
two soviet officers followed her to the train and then took 
her to the police station where she was detained for three 
hours now they follow her all the time said mrs rosnovsky 
she said she spoke to her sister wednesday by telephone 
shes not a soldier shes just a woman but shes 
stubborn she will fight said mrs rosnovsky 
last month 1086 jews left the soviet union the highest monthly 
figure in seven years but it fell far short of the 1979 peak level 
when about 4000 departed every month 
the israeli government has said about 400000 of the three 
million soviet jews took initial steps toward emigration but only 
a few thousand followed through with formal visa requests 
mrs keisskuna last month said she was denied permission to 
leave because she worked as a radio engineer and could possess 
sensitive knowledge she calls the authorities continued refusal 
to let her leave absurd since she was fired from her job 13 
years ago 
mrs keisskuna asserted that the improvement in emigration was 
part of gorbachevs efforts to improve his image without changing 
his repressive policies 
he is very very clever to get so much good publicity for such 
little steps she said it is very easy to take a few steps 
with jewish people everybody knows the support we have so they 
the soviets made some steps and everybody applauded 
mrs rosnovsky has been battling for her family every since she 
left them behind in 1974 
she said her father was allowed to leave in 1976 following the 
intervention of golda meir then retired as israeli prime minister 
with contacts in the socialist internationale her mother spent 
more than three years in a psychiatric prison but was released a 
few years ago and came to israel

a west german surgeon believed to be the first 
in the world to repair livers outside the body says the procedure 
offers a temporary reprieve for victims of one of the bleakest 
forms of cancer 
its the best possible retaliation against cancer for these 
patients and they are improved dramatically said dr rudolf 
pichlmayr of the university of hannover medical school 
pichlmayr said thursday he has performed outofbody liver 
operations three times including twice this month there was no 
other option for the patients two women and a man suffering from 
malignant liver tumors he said 
in each case pichlmayr removed the liver worked on it for four 
to five hours then put it back in tumorfree 
all three patients are doing well although its likely the 
tumors will reappear pichlmayr said 
its the fate of all tumor patients but we surgeons have to 
do our utmost to take care of them he said in a telephone 
interview from west germany 
pichlmayr said he is giving the patients time and perhaps a 
chance for a longer life he said hes also giving them hope 
thats a very important reason he said weve improved 
the quality of life very much 
until pichlmayrs efforts socalled bench surgery had involved 
only kidneys a wellestablished procedure to correct vessel 
problems or remove cysts and benign tumors kidneys are less 
delicate than livers and a patient can do without them longer 
it represents a very interesting and positive step said the 
university of pittsburghs dr thomas e starzl who performed the 
worlds first liver transplant in 1967 
my hats off to him its a monumental effort said dr john 
s najarian of the university of minnesota 
najarian said he has transplanted donor livers into four 
patients with cancerous liver tumors only one is still alive 
unlike pichlmayrs patients there was no evidence the cancer had 
spread at the time of surgery 
youre just buying time najarian said 
liver cancer is among the more deadlier forms of the disease 
said frank mahaney a spokesman for the national cancer institute 
if detected early patients have a 10 percent to 30 percent chance 
of surviving five years if not they have a mere 3 percent chance 
pichlmayr first performed outofbody liver surgery feb 5 on a 
40yearold woman whose liver had more than doubled in weight 
because of tumors 
he considered transplanting a new liver into the woman but 
ruled it out because he believed her cancer had spread and that it 
would have been a waste of one of the scarce donor organs 
pichlmayr also decided against the conventional method of 
removing the cancerous sections of the liver while it remained in 
the body because of the tumors size and central location 
pichlmayr who described the procedure in a west german medical 
journal in april removed the womans liver by cutting and clamping 
its numerous vessels he connected two main veins to a pump that 
served as a bypass and kept the blood coursing though her body 
after five hours and 19 minutes outside the body the liver was 
reinserted as a transplanted organ is the woman has since returned 
home pichlmayr said 
shes gained weight again and at this moment shes very 
healthy he said she was suffering extremely and i think she 
would not be alive now 
pichlmayr performed the operation again may 6 on a 48yearold 
woman and may 11 on a 58yearold man 
the lady is at home quite well he said the man is still 
in the hospital but is good 
three days before his first outofbody liver surgery pichlmayr 
performed the worlds first splitliver transplant in which one 
donor organ was divided and each half transplanted into separate 
patients

gen manuel antonio noriega told a 
packed national assembly session that the united states 
takeitorleaveit attitude forced the collapse of talks about his 
leaving power 
the world must know that the conversation sustained with the 
envoy of president reagan broke down when he presented us with an 
ultimatum in which panama had to immediately accept his last 
offer noriega said 
i know it and i say so because i was there us secretary of 
state george shultz wasnt there noriega said in his speech 
thursday to a cheering crowd in the 500seat assembly chamber 
outside the chamber of the 67member assembly hundreds of 
people listened to his words through a loudspeaker 
noriega who commands panamas 15000strong defense forces and 
is his countrys de facto leader did not elaborate shultz on 
wednesday announced the breakdown of talks and blamed noriega 
the general said thursday that panama had accepted several us 
proposals but added even this wasnt sufficient the united 
states desired an ultimatum 
in exchange for noriegas stepping down the reagan 
administration had offered to lift economic sanctions it imposed on 
panama after the general was indicted on us drug trafficking 
charges in february 
it also offered to have the indictments dismissed 
the white house still recognizes the presidency of eric arturo 
delvalle whom the noriegadominated national assembly deposed feb 
26 after delvalle tried to fire the general 
noriega appeared before the assembly to answer questions about 
what the government insists on calling conversations not 
negotiations on a possible arrangement under which he would 
relinquish power 
asked whether his resignation had been discussed the general 
replied the commander doesnt abandon his ship in stormy 
weather 
noriega said panama has become a pawn for us political 
candidates and charged them with using the flag of panama in 
whatever way is convenient for them 
he said some candidates want to bury files that weigh on their 
shoulders but did not explain 
vice president george bush the likely republican presidential 
nominee has been accused of having detailed knowledge of noriegas 
alleged links to colombian cocaine traffickers before the general 
was indicted 
bush denies the allegations 
noriega on thursday repeated his conditions for stepping down 
extra troops sent to us bases in panama must be withdrawn and the 
position of manuel solis palma who took over as president after 
delvalles ouster must be guaranteed 
earlier solis palma told a womens organization that us 
negotiators told noriega in march to be out of the country in 48 
hours or face the consequences when noriega refused solis palma 
said the americans softened their manner he did not elaborate on 
what was meant by consequences 
solis palma said the final us offer was to drop the drug 
charges against noriega in return for his giving up command of the 
defense forces on aug 12 and leaving panama in september 
he said the united states also had promised to release 50 
million in panamanian assets frozen in american banks if a national 
unity cabinet was chosen that picked a president who could not be 
solis palma 
meanwhile president vinicio cerezo of guatemala offered to 
mediate a solution to the impasse 
cerezo told reporters in guatemala city on thursday that panama 
is experiencing a radicalization against the united states that 
is dangerous for the region and that moreover is causing grave 
damages to the panamanian nation 
he said he had spoken with us and panamanian officials on 
the possibility of a plan aimed at finding a space for dialogue 
in panama to consolidate a democratic process 
cerezo met on thursday with james michel the us ambassador to 
guatemala cerezo also told reporters he recently held 
conversations with ricardo arias calderon president of panamas 
opposition christian democrats 
arias calderon said thursday that the us negotiators failed to 
strike a deal with noriega because of a growing division in the 
panamanian military of which the united states was not aware 
errors by the united states were not the only factor although 
they were a factor he said

to convince a jury that the government 
authorized his role in the irancontra affair businessman richard 
v secord may want to question oliver l north about his 
congressional testimony on the subject 
to show jurors that his direction of an aid program for the 
nicaragua contras was sanctioned despite a congressional ban north 
may want to ask john m poindexter about his congressional 
statements on the operation 
like his onetime business partner secord businessman albert 
hakim may need to use norths testimony during a trial 
normally a defendant can try to prove his innocence in a 
criminal conspiracy trial by questioning a codefendant about his 
prior statements 
but the irancontra case has developed an apparently 
unprecedented legal tangle that could make it impossible for the 
defendants to exercise that right 
the dilemma is so serious that us district judge gerhard a 
gesell said thursday it may be impossible to prosecute the 
defendants on the conspiracy charges that form the heart of the 
case 
the testimony of defendants north a former national security 
council staffer poindexter the exnational security adviser and 
hakim was given to joint congressional committees under a grant of 
limited immunity from prosecution 
secord a retired air force office did not testify under 
immunity but he has filed legal briefs contending the immunized 
testimony of north could prove his innocence 
the immunity grant to three defendants means independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh cannot use the immunized testimony against them 
and he would be precluded from using it against secord if all four 
are tried together 
but left unclear thursday was whether the defendants could 
question each other about the congressional testimony 
as i see it it is a practical impossibility to try the 
conspiracy counts in the context of rules on immunity gesell 
said if you try them together you violate the immunities 
but gesell added that trying the defendants separately makes a 
conspiracy trial a farce none gets the benefit of the others 
testimony 
the judge said he did not want to conduct four separate trials 
under a separation motion sought by the defense four individual 
trials is ridiculous he said 
he added that he searched hard to find a case and i havent 
found one where its fair to say that three of four defendants 
have been broadly immunized by governmental action 
gesell made no ruling on the immunity issue but said he hoped 
to resolve the matter and other defense motions by the end of june 
the judge scheduled a closed hearing for june 13 to determine if 
any lawyers for the state justice and defense departments the 
white house and cia used the defendants immunized testimony to 
prepare officials for questioning by walshs grand jury 
gesell said he wanted to determine if any of the many government 
officials walsh intends to call as trial witnesses were influenced 
by immunized statements made by the defendants 
herbert j stern a former federal judge representing walsh 
said the immunity grants wont prevent a fair trial 
if secord wants to question north about his congressional 
testimony all general secord has to do is ask colonel north for 
the same facts and out it comes stern said 
defense lawyer barry simon argued that most of the witnesses 
walsh intends to call at trial were so influenced by the immunized 
statements you cant unscramble from what the witnesses know now 
having seen read and analyzed that testimony from what they knew 
before 
the four defendants are charged with conspiring to corrupt the 
sale of us arms to iran by diverting profits to the contra rebels 
in nicaragua during a time when congress banned us military aid 
to them 
the four are also are charged with theft of government property 
and wire fraud in connection with the alleged diversion 
in addition north and poindexter are charged with making false 
statements and obstructing investigations by congress and attorney 
general edwin meese iii into covert assistance given the contras

government scientists are planning to spend a 
month studying the skies over illinois to learn how much effect 
summer storms have on acid rain 
the project which will start on june 1 and continue for four 
weeks will use both radar and airborne measurements to see how 
long and how far storms carry pollutants said william j brennan 
of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
if youre going to get a handle on pollutants that are put 
into the atmosphere and what their impact will be downwind you 
have to know what happens to them aloft brennan said thursday 
how much of the pollutants fall out within a 10 or 20 or 
50mile range of the source he asked how much of it gets 
carried aloft and moved further along what are the conditions that 
cause it to either fall out early on or get carried along for some 
distance a scientist always has to know why 
brennan said that the study being undertaken by his agency the 
department of energy federal research laboratories several 
universities and the illinois water survey will provide a body of 
knowledge from which the policymakers can reach decisions on acid 
rain 
during the fourweek study based at willard field in champaign 
ill one team of scientists will use flying laboratories to see 
how storms redistribute pollutants while another team will use a 
new radar technique to observe the movement of pollution in the 
troposphere seven to 10 miles above the ground brennan said 
he said a team from the oceanic and atmospheric administrations 
aeronomy laboratory in boulder colo will be conducting a related 
study to test two kinds of doppler radars one for monitoring 
upperlevel winds and the other for winds near the surface 
at the same time the illinois water survey will use its 
rainfallcollection network to determine how much pollution is 
contained in rainfall from local storms

the federal government is telling more 
suburbanites that urban air pollution could be spreading their way 
and they might have to accept new controls 
the environmental protection agency on thursday designated more 
than 100 additional counties that must be considered in drawing up 
new plans to control air pollution mostly in urban areas 
most of the counties are on the edges of 107 metropolitan and 
rural areas already designated as failing to meet federal standards 
for ozone carbon monoxide or both 
not all the new counties are suburban nantucket county 
massachusetts an island 30 miles off cape cod was added to the 
list of those that must be considered when new carbon monoxide 
control plans are drafted by the state 
the counties were picked not because their air is polluted in 
most of them there are no measurements but because census data 
suggest they could be contributing to areawide pollution such as 
through heavy auto commuting 
some counties will be dropped as planning goes forward but 
those that remain could find their industries facing additional 
controls and their residents required to submit their cars for 
pollution inspections 
clearly what im doing is not sufficient to deal with the 
problem epa administrator lee m thomas told a news conference 
thomas said he was doing nothing that would preempt 
congressional revisions to the clean air act aimed at eventual 
compliance with federal standards something originally expected in 
1977 
he said as he had before he hoped congress would tell him what 
to do next but if congress does not act by aug 31 when an 
eightmonth prohibition on sanctions against recalcitrant areas 
expires thomas said he will require states to come up with new 
controls as he outlined last november 
epa had planned to forbid construction of major new pollution 
sources in 14 cities when congress temporarily barred the action 
last december 
epa lists 68 areas as failing to meet federal ozone standards 
and 59 as not meeting carbon monoxide standards with 20 not 
meeting both thursdays decision adds 125 counties to the 225 
counties in the ozone areas and 115 counties to the 96 counties in 
the carbon monoxide areas there is some overlap in the two lists 
of counties 
thursdays designations came in expected formal notices to 44 
state governors and the mayor of the district of columbia that epa 
was disapproving air pollution control plans or revoking previous 
approvals for the noncomplying ozone and carbon monoxide areas 
hawaii north dakota south dakota wyoming iowa and vermont 
have no noncomplying areas and are not affected 
states have 60 days to submit schedules to complete new plans 
which can take two years to fulfill promises in old plans to 
begin new assessments of actual pollution as opposed to computer 
estimates and to add monitors where epa says theyre needed

some rural families will soon be able to take 
advantage of a federal program that is helping 110000 urban 
residents pay their rent sometimes with cash left over for the 
renter 
housing and urban development secretary samuel r pierce 
announced thursday that huds housing voucher program was being 
extended into 50 public housing districts in 13 states 
initially the program will aid only 2178 rural families but 
officials say they hope it can be expanded to other housing 
districts and states hud has asked for funding to issue an 
additional 100000 vouchers in fiscal 1989 
the largest numbers of rural vouchers will be available in 
kentucky mississippi missouri and michigan according to pierces 
announcement 
james schoenberger deputy federal housing commissioner said 
areas in those states and in nine others were chosen because they 
had public housing authorities that appear most ready to set up the 
rural programs in cooperation with the farmers home administration 
the voucher program which began as an experimental alternative 
to public housing in 1984 became permanent under a law signed by 
president reagan earlier this year 
qualified lowincome families may be given housing vouchers 
worth the difference between 30 percent of their family income and 
the local payment standard for adequate housing in the area 
where they live officials said that hud expects to be funding more 
singlefamily dwellings in rural communities than it does in 
cities where most recipients live in apartments 
the program contains what hud officials call a shopping 
incentive allowing renters to rent whatever kind of housing they 
want rather than limiting them to public housing projects 
we think its a program with a great amount of sensitivity to 
it schoenberger said 
he said that the vouchers allow people to receive aid without 
subjecting themselves to the social problems that often plague 
public housing projects 
in a typical situation under either the rural or urban programs 
a family might be earning 10000 a year meaning that it would 
be expected to pay 30 percent of its income or 3000 in rent if 
hud determines the payment standard for an adequate unit for 
the family to be 5000 the family would receive vouchers worth 
2000 a year 
recipients then can decide whether they want to pay 5000 and 
use all of the voucher stay in a 3000 unit and use the 
additional funds for other needs or pay more than 5000 to 
further improve their lifestyle 
in public housing renters dont see any of the assistance given 
by the government under the voucher program an arrangement can be 
made to return money to the renters if they can find a unit that 
rents for less than the subsidy 
schoenberger said that there already may be a line of applicants 
for the rural vouchers in some housing authorites but in others 
there could be an opportunity to pretty much walk into the door 
and take advantage of it 
under the program select mississippi housing authorities will 
assist 441 famlies kentucky 422 families missouri 380 
michigan 225 and georgia 130 new hampshire vermont oklahoma 
and washington will each be allowed 100 vouchers while montana 
north dakota and idaho will each serve 50 rural families and 
louisiana will help 30

us district judge alcee l hastings said he 
remains confident that a house subcommittee will refuse to 
recommend that he be impeached on charges of conspiring to solicit 
a bribe 
on thursday at the end of five days of hearings before the 
house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice hastings said 
i havent heard anything new so far these are old charges they 
all came up in my trial 
asked how he would assess the hearings to date hastings 
replied hastings five congress nothing 
the subcommittee hearings will continue next wednesday 
hastings who still sits on the federal bench in miami has been 
accused by an investigative panel of the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta of taking part in a bribery scheme with his 
close friend washington lawyer william a borders 
borders was convicted in 1982 of arranging a 150000 bribe for 
hastings from two miami racketeers frank and tom romano in 
exchange for a promise of lenient sentences one year later a 
separate trial jury acquitted hastings of conspiring with borders 
to solicit a bribe from the romano brothers 
hastings is also charged with compromising an fbi investigation 
into zoning code corruption in the miami area in 1985 
earlier fbi agent william j murphy jr who directed the 
hastingsborders investigation testified at thursdays 
subcommittee hearing 
that hastings was a target from the beginning of the probe 
murphy also said that hastings and borders werent illegally 
lured into taking the bribe even though an undercover fbi agent 
gave 120000 to borders before he was arrested on oct 9 1981 
murphy said the fbi began the investigation after an informant 
william dredge had bragged that he controlled several judges 
including hastings and another federal jurist who was not 
identified 
he said the undercover operation took place because we were 
only trying to prove or disprove what dredge said 
in answer to a question murphy said hastings was a target 
from the outset his name was mentioned by borders we tried to 
prove or disprove the allegation and it turned out to be true 
rep patrick l swindall rga said that the fbis undercover 
operation appeared to him to be a classic textbook entrapment 
saying he was not an attorney murphy replied that he did not 
believe it was entrapment he said the operation was a tool to 
respond to dredges allegations if borders didnt show up at the 
meeting and didnt say the things he did the case would have 
stopped 
the information we were trying to prove or disprove was that 
borders and judge hastings were going to do a crime murphy said 
we didnt decide one day in the office to get judge hastings

democrats pushing for expanded aids testing 
and counseling say they had to drop a bitterly contested provision 
protecting aids victims from discrimination to get their bill 
moving 
the bill which provides 400 million next year and each of the 
following two years for aids testing won voice vote approval on 
thursday from the house energy and commerce health subcommittee 
the measure now goes to the full energy and commerce committee for 
a vote probably early next month a similar bill is pending in a 
senate committee 
the bill was welcomed by some in the gay community even without 
the ban on discrimination because of its provisions for counseling 
and confidentiality of test results even without the 
nondiscrimination provision its worth having said jeffrey 
levi executive director of the national gay and lesbian task force 
subcommittee chairman henry waxman dcalif said that the 
antidiscrimination provision was dropped because unfortunately 
that policy is caught up in such controversy that we will not be 
able to pursue it at this time 
asked what went into the decision to drop it an aide replied 
counting votes 
waxman and rep ron wyden dore said that they hoped they 
could eventually win a ban on discrimination against aids victims 
and carriers 
the discrimination ban not only would protect aids victims but 
also encourage voluntary testing wyden said because many 
americans will be reluctant to come forward for voluntary testing 
if they are then open to blatant discrimination on the basis of the 
results 
weve got to keep pushing thats the one key missing part 
he added 
wyden and waxman said that federal laws and policies clearly 
state that discrimination by the federal government and its 
contractors is not allowed but there are some real questions 
about the private sector wyden said 
the bill authorizes new and expanded testing programs run by 
states localities and private groups testing would have to be 
voluntary and accompanied by counseling anonymous testing and use 
of pseudonyms would be permitted to the extent possible under state 
laws 
under the measure health professionals or others who violated 
confidentiality standards outlined in the bill intentionally or 
negligently could be fined up to 10000 for each offense 
on its third and final day of deliberations thursday the 
subcommittee agreed to an amendment saying that money in the bill 
cannot be used for counseling that promotes or encourages 
directly homosexual or unsafe heterosexual activity or intravenous 
substance abuse the amendment also says that counselors must 
supply the most current scientific knowledge available 
provided that any informational materials used are not obscene 
the amendment arose after conservatives in congress complained 
that the gay mens health crisis in new york which receives 
federal money produced an educational comic book and videotape 
that explicitly depicted homosexual acts 
the panel also approved amendments requiring testing of people 
convicted of intravenous drug use prostitution or a crime related 
to sexual assault and making it a crime for a person to contribute 
to a blood bank or have sexual relations if he knows he has aids or 
carries the aids virus 
amendments requiring testing of marriage license applicants and 
hospital patients were rejected the subcommittee also refused to 
require that public health authorities be given the names 
addresses and phone numbers of people who dont have aids but test 
positive for the virus that causes it 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring there is no known cure for the disease which damages 
the bodys immune system

the head of the us customs service blames 
the public outcry over the new federal zero tolerance antidrug 
policy on wealthy americans whose boats are being seized by the 
government 
customs commissioner william von raab in his first appearance 
before congress since the policy began said thursday that seizures 
of vessels at sea after discoveries of miniscule amounts of illegal 
drugs were affecting arrogant stock brokers and smooth lawyers 
who think theyre above the law 
von raab told members of the house coast guard and navigation 
subcommittee that complaints were coming from rich people who 
have a lot of pull with the media who have a lot of pull with 
congress 
the policy he said is supported by the american people 
joining von raab was admiral paul a yost jr commandant of the 
coast guard who disputed lawmakers complaints that his service 
was squandering money from its already tight budget 
yost told the legislators that the arrests and seizures were 
occurring only during routine patrols and inspections saying i 
am not wasting resources in this policy 
most members of the subcommittee however rejected the 
officials claims and insisted that zero tolerance was a case of an 
overzealous government going too far 
in the minds of the public this is a government policy gone 
awry said rep robert w davis of michigan the panels ranking 
republican it symbolizes unfairness 
the subcommittees chairman rep earl hutto dfla was one of 
several lawmakers who complained that the seizure of fishing boats 
after crewmen were found to have tiny amounts of drugs was 
depriving innocent owners of a means to earn a living 
innocent persons are being hurt more than users he said 
some members of the panel engaged von raab in heated exchanges 
rep don young ralaska complained to the customs official 
about a small boat seized in alaska after paraphernalia such as 
rolling paper and rolling machines were discovered 
young said that such implements could be perfectly innocent and 
told von raab youre not helping the cause here at all in fact 
youre hurting it 
under the policy customs and coast guard officers finding small 
amounts of illegal drugs during searches conducted at sea have 
begun arresting people and seizing boats 
the new procedures have resulted in the temporary seizure of 
such boats as the atlantis ii owned by the woods hole 
oceanographic institution of massachusetts after a crewman was 
found to have a tiny amount of marijuana 
in addition the 25 million yacht ark royal and the monkey 
business the pleasure boat that former presidential candidate 
gary hart sailed on with model donna rice were seized after small 
quantities of drugs were discovered 
under new guidelines issued late last week authorities finding 
small amounts of drugs on board vessels beyond the 12mile limit 
now are seizing boats only if they appear to be involved in 
transporting drugs into the country 
some lawmakers defended the policy 
rep wally herger rcalif conceded that zero tolerance needs 
adjustments but said he believed the policy is sound 
rep bob clement dtenn said my constituents want a tough 
policy and that policy is that no amount of drugs is ok 
von raab said that the customs service has made 1500 seizures 
mostly of automobiles crossing into the united states since zero 
tolerance took effect yost said 44 boats have so far been seized 
13 of which have already been released 
the customs service implemented the policy on march 21 and the 
coast guard followed suit on april 11

house republicans staged a legislative ambush 
in an attempt to renew military aid to nicaraguas contra rebels 
but were rebuffed amid fears that such a move would upset delicate 
negotiations in managua 
in a surprise move rep henry hyde rill sought thursday to 
amend an intelligence bill to permit president reagan to dip into 
the cias contingency fund to finance future covert military aid to 
the rebels the measure was defeated 214190 
since 1983 the law authorizing intelligence operations has 
contained a prohibition on use of the spy agencys contingency fund 
to buy weapons and other supplies for the contras the ban was 
imposed after lawmakers became angered at the cias role in aiding 
the nicaraguan war 
hydes amendment would have dropped the prohibition from the 
law at present the rebels can receive only humanitarian aid 
food clothing and medicine from the united states under a 177 
million program approved by congress earlier this year 
proponents of the move argued that things have gone badly for 
the rebels since congress voted earlier this year to end military 
aid the two sides are nearing the end of a twomonth truce agreed 
to during talks at sapoa nicaragua 
the contra supporters said that the nicaraguan government has 
taken advantage of the ceasefire to weaken the rebels and has 
failed to live up to promises made in a regional peace accord 
reached last year instead they argued the sandinistas have 
harassed peaceful antigovernment demonstrators arrested labor 
leaders and denied press freedom 
giving reagan the power to resume covert military aid any time 
after oct 1 would add pressure for the managua regime to release 
political prisoners restore civil liberties and hold free 
elections supporters of the amendment argued 
opponents of the move noted that a new round of negotiations 
between the two warring sides was taking place in managua and said 
that there was still hope that a lasting peace could be achieved 
i cannot think of a more pernicious illtimed amendment 
said rep david bonior dmich at the very minute that the 
contras who have struggled for three weeks to put their own act 
together meet with the government of nicaragua an amendment 
is offered to put the cia back into this war 
in another attempt to pressure the sandinistas a group of 
conservative lawmakers announced plans to seek new military aid for 
the rebels if the managua government fails to meet its obligations 
under the peace accord by the time the formal truce ends on may 31 
rep jack kemp rny while declining to give precise figures 
said the package would include substantial military and 
humanitarian aid sufficient to last the contras a year to 18 
months

tennessee sen albert gore jr remains on the 
list of possible democratic candidates for the vice presidency 
despite calling the job a political dead end when he was 
seeking the no 1 spot on the ticket 
gores prospects of joining the ticket declined in the 
estimation of some democrats as a result of his attacks on both 
jesse jackson and michael dukakis in the final weeks of his 
presidential campaign 
he would bring to the ticket however credentials as a 
southerner with proven popularity in the region 
gore ended his 1988 presidential hopes after the new york 
primary in april his campaign a failure outside of the regionwide 
victories in the super tuesday primaries 
at 40 the youngest of the potential vice presidential nominees 
gore remains in the speculation in part because of those southern 
successes 
some observers contend that dukakis the likely democratic 
presidential nominee needs a southerner on the ticket if he is to 
carry any states in the region that is often crucial to democratic 
electoral strategy other southerners getting frequent mention are 
sens sam nunn of georgia bob graham of florida and lloyd bentsen 
of texas 
gore insisted throughout his campaign that he had no interest in 
the no 2 job he did not flatly rule it out however 
i have no interest in it might very well turn it down 
indeed and probably would he said once 
i think vice president bush will demonstrate again this year 
that it is a political dead end gore said 
gore met privately with dukakis recently dukakis insists he is 
not considering the selection of a running mate until he has 
collected a majority of convention delegates 
gore has nearly 400 democratic national convention delegates he 
has asked them to remain committed to him but he has been losing 
delegates nearly daily to dukakis 
when his presidential hopes reached a stage of desperation gore 
turned up his attacks on dukakis and accused him of foreignpolicy 
blunders born of inexperience and lack of knowledge 
he turned attacks on jackson too on foreign policy and 
blasted dukakis as afraid to say a single word about jesse 
jackson 
new york mayor edward koch backed gore and picked up the 
criticism of jackson with a vengeance gore aides were dismayed by 
kochs attacks even gore seemed to cringe although he did not 
take public issue with his newfound supporter 
gore is the son of a veteran tennessee politician albert gore 
sr who spent 32 years in the house and senate before losing his 
seat in 1970 with his opposition to the vietnam war an issue gore 
jr enlisted in the army and served in vietnam 
he was born and educated in washington dc attending the 
elite st albans prep school and then harvard his wife tipper 
was a high school sweetheart and she has become wellknown in her 
own right for leading public crusades against violent and sexually 
explicit lyrics in music aimed at young people 
gore worked as a newspaper reporter in nashville tenn and 
entered both divinity school and law school not completing either 
he quit law school after two years when the house seat his father 
once held came open and won election in 1976 
he won election to the senate in 1984 when republican howard 
baker declined to run again

liberal than some of tennessees other members of congress gore 
positioned himself in the presidential race to the right of most

michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
frontrunner holds a 13point lead over republican nomineetobe 
george bush according to a poll published today 
dukakis leads bush 53 percent to 40 percent the survey by the 
washington post and abc news indicates 
the poll also found that the vice presidents unfavorability 
rating is nearly four times as great as that of dukakis bush is 
viewed unfavorably by 37 percent and dukakis by 10 percent the 
newspaper said 
the massachusetts governor is favorably rated by 67 percent of 
those surveyed to 50 percent for the vice president 
the survey also indicated that the gender gap plays a part 
in dukakis lead at this stage among women voters dukakis holds a 
21 lead 61 percent to 33 percent bush has the advantage among 
male voters but only of 4 percentage points the newspaper said 
the survey of 1172 randomly selected registered voters 
nationwide also suggested however that the support of both 
candidates is soft and could easily shift between now and the 
november election 
dukakis edge over bush widened when compared to a similar 
postabc poll conducted in march in that survey dukakis had a 
5point lead several other polls conducted in recent weeks have 
given dukakis a doubledigit lead 
according to the post 57 percent of the dukakis supporters said 
they backed the massachusetts governor largely because they dont 
want bush to become president the post noted that bush has the 
backing of most reagan supporters but said that reagans 
disapproval rating stands at 46 percent 
on specific issues the postabc survey indicated that bush has 
a 21 edge when the two are compared on the topic of national 
defense and scored a bit better than dukakis on fighting inflation 
and keeping taxes down but on virtually all other issues dukakis 
was ahead 
the democratic contender was seen as likely to do better at 
keeping the united states out of war helping the poor by a large 
margin reducing the drug problem protecting the social security 
system and keeping unemployment down dukakis was also given an 
edge in issues like providing leadership reducing the threat of 
nuclear war bringing down the deficit and maintaining high ethical 
and moral standards in his administration 
the dukakis camp has played down the recent favorable poll 
results the bush campaign however has reacted to the surveys by 
pointing out that the election is months away and the situation 
could change dramatically once the two have secured their 
respective parties nominations and are campaigning directly 
against one another 
the telephone interviews for the survey were conducted from may 
19 to may 26 the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage 
points the newspaper said

if you live in new york your chances of dying 
from a heart attack may be twice as great as in new mexico 
according to a study that finds significant geographic 
differences in heartdisease death rates 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
heartdisease rates were generally highest in concentrated 
urbanized areas of the northeast or midwest while the west had the 
lowest rates 
were talking about thousands of deaths difference between the 
low states and the high states said dr patrick l remington a 
cdc researcher 
heart disease is the leading killer in the united states taking 
more lives each year than all other causes combined according to 
the american heart association in 1985 540800 americans died of 
ischemic or blockedartery heart disease most commonly heart 
attacks according to cdc statistics 
remington said the stress of urbanization itself is probably not 
to blame for the high rates in the densely populated northeast and 
midwest but many people in those regions probably have lifestyles 
that could lead to more heart attacks 
just living in a big city doesnt appear to be a risk 
factor he said but more desk jobs and greater reliance on 
automobiles all are part of a sedentary lifestyle that contributes 
to greater risk of a heart attack 
he said lack of exercise contributes to weight gain higher 
cholesterol levels stress and high blood pressure all factors in 
heart disease 
lack of exercise can be directly connected to all these 
factors remington said 
another likely cause of significant statetostate 
discrepancies remington said is the prevalence of cigarette 
smoking 
these northeast and midwest states are the states that have 
high rates of cigarette smoking he said and we do know that 
cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of heart 
disease most deaths from smoking are heart attacks not lung 
cancer 
in contrast the lowest rates of smoking are in the west he 
said 
the five worst states for men and heart disease new york new 
jersey rhode island michigan and ohio are all in the northeast 
or midwest where other states with the highest rates were 
clustered the cdc reported 
the best rates are clustered near chesapeake bay and in the 
west the five lowest heart disease death rates for men were in the 
district of columbia hawaii new mexico maryland and utah 
similar geographic patterns were shown for women although males 
historically suffer most from heart disease 
new york had the nations worst rate with 320 out of every 
100000 men dying of ischemic heart disease in 1985 the national 
average was 249 per 100000 in new mexico the rate was 151 
remington said other possible causes for the geographic 
disparities include cholesterol levels and differences in medical 
care for which no firm statebystate data are available 
sociodemographic differences and population shifts also might 
play a part the atlantabased cdc said in its weekly report 
however heart disease death rates for all ages and geographic 
areas have decreased in the last two decades the cdc said citing 
previously reported research 
remington noted that much of the nation had similarly high heart 
disease death rates in the 1950s then california and the western 
states began declining theres something about it in certain 
states it started earlier

another adviser to attorney general edwin 
meese iii is about to leave his justice department post according 
to a published report meanwhile a majority of people surveyed in 
a new poll say they have a negative impression of the attorney 
general 
assistant attorney general charles j cooper is talking with 
private law firms and is expected to announce his resignation 
before independent counsel james c mckay issues a report on his 
yearlong criminal investigation of meeses financial dealings the 
washington post reported in fridays editions mckay is expected to 
release his report within the next few weeks 
cooper played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to win 
confirmation of robert h bork to the us supreme court and was 
among a small group of trusted aides who helped meese investigate 
the irancontra affair in november 1986 
two other top department officials deputy attorney general 
arnold burns and criminal division chief william weld quit 
recently out of concern that meeses continued tenure was hurting 
the departments operations morale and public image 
the post which quoted unidentified sources said that cooper 
did not return repeated telephone calls on thursday seeking 
comment but the newspaper quoted justice department spokesman 
patrick korten as saying that if cooper were leaving it would 
scarcely be unusual at this point in the administration 
take a look around at a dozen cabinet agencies around town 
and you will find a number of presidential appointees have already 
departed for the private sector korten said adding that he had 
no knowledge of what chucks plans are 
meese told a gathering of conservative congressmen on wednesday 
that mckays report will clear him completely said rep cass 
ballenger rnc who attended the meeting 
the report is expected to raise questions about meeses ethical 
behavior 
meanwhile a washington postabc news poll released thursday 
found that 51 percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable 
impression of meese and only 9 percent had a favorable impression 
with 40 percent expressing no opinion 
in addition 38 percent said that he should resign while 9 
percent said he should not and 54 percent expressed no opinion on 
the matter 
the poll was based on telephone interviews conducted may 19 to 
26 with 1508 randomly selected adults the margin of error was 
plus or minus 3 percentage points

two indian laborers died today of 
injuries suffered when a bomb went off in a crowded market in 
punjab a northern indian state racked by sikh separatist violence 
in another development the federal government issued an 
ordinance banning the use of temples and shrines for political 
activity or the harboring of wanted criminals 
president ramaswami venkataraman issued the ordinance on 
thursday aimed at ending sikh extremists use of the golden temple 
in amritsar as a base for their separatist activities 
the bomb apparently hidden in a rickshaw went off thursday 
night in the town of phagwara in karpurthala district east of 
amritsar 
the press trust of india news agency said 30 people were 
injured most of them laborers from nearby work camps the news 
agency said three of the victims were in serious condition at local 
hospitals 
it quoted police as saying the bombing was the work of the 
barbar khalsa gang one of a dozen sikh extremist groups operating 
in punjab state the news agency quoted district police chief 
swaran singh as saying police raided a number of the radicals 
hideouts in a search for the bombers 
sikh radicals who have been waging a guerrilla war for an 
independent homeland in punjab since 1982 recently stepped up 
attacks on hindu migrant workers in punjab 
government officials say that onethird of the estimated 700000 
hindu migrants have fled to their homes in eastern india 
threatening to undermine punjabs agricultural economy 
the new ordinance was described by the times of india newspaper 
as the first step toward separation of religion from politics 
legislation to make the rule permanent will be introduced in the 
next session of parliament government officials said prime 
minister rajiv gandhis governing congress party has a majority in 
both houses of parliament and the legislation is expected to be 
enacted quickly 
violations will be punishable by imprisonment of up to five 
years or a 770 fine 
the ordinance was announced after the sikh committee of elders 
that governs the golden temple and other sikh shrines said it could 
not cooperate with police in keeping the sites free of extremists 
police and paramilitary troops have maintained a cordon around 
the golden temple since may 9 when sikh radicals inside the shrine 
fired on police inspectors outside its walls 
a siege ended may 18 with the surrender of the last of about 200 
sikh extremists and sympathizers from the shrine fortysix deaths 
were reported during the confrontation most of them sikh militants 
the indian express newspaper reported today that the government 
has decided to go ahead with a plan to tear down scores of shops 
and homes close to the shrine the creation of a security 
corridor would improve the ability of police to patrol around the 
complex and prevent extremists from entering through numerous 
alleys around it 
sikh militants have killed more than 1170 people in punjab this 
year in hitandrun attacks last year 1030 people died 
sikhs whose religion was formed 500 years ago as an alternative 
to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated against by 
indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 percent of 
indias 800 million population but are a majority in punjab

the government of prime minister margaret thatcher 
indicated it wants to talk with northern irelands main political 
parties about returning some local control to the province 
strifetorn northern ireland has been administered directly from 
london since britain suspended the provincial parliament there in 
march 1972 because of sharp differences between the majority 
protestant and minority roman catholic communities 
in belfast meanwhile a deputy commander of an outlawed 
protestant paramilitary group was sentenced thursday to three life 
terms in prison after confessing to three murders and 41 other 
terrorist crimes 
lord justice macdermott sentenced denis mcclean 40 and said 
the defendant had pleaded guilty to terrorist crimes that could 
never have been proved if he had not confessed to police 
in london the secretary of state for northern ireland tom 
king said in a statement thursday night that he would consider 
further how progress might be made towards giving some power back 
to northern irelands provincial authorities 
the announcement by king the cabinet member responsible for the 
province followed a series of separate talks in recent months 
involving him and political leaders from northern ireland 
earlier thursday king met with the provinces two main 
protestant politicians james molyneaux and the rev ian paisley 
molyneaux is leader of the official unionist party paisley is 
leader of the democratic unionist party 
the liberal british newspaper the guardian said molyneaux and 
paisley had agreed to talks with northern irelands moderate 
catholic social democratic and labor party 
the guardian said however that it has yet to be seen whether the 
social democratic and labor party wants to talk with the 
protestants 
in belfast crown court judge macdermott said he believed 
mcclean a leader of the outlawed ulster volunteer force had 
confessed because he wanted to clear his conscience 
in addition to the murders the charges for which mcclean was 
convicted included manslaughter of a policewoman six attempted 
murders bomb making causing explosions and illegal possession of 
guns 
the prosecution said mccleans first victim was a 62yearold 
protestant william wallace who died during a gun and bomb attack 
on a belfast bar in 1973 
mcclean had admitted in a written confession to police that he 
and two other men attacked the bar because it was owned by a roman 
catholic 
mccleans two other murder victims killed in random attacks 
against catholic targets were a 45yearold taxi driver in 1984 
and a 30yearold hospital chef last year both were catholics 
the policewoman died while on patrol in 1975 in a bomb attack at 
a bar at the east coast resort of bangor

a mother of 10 tending her garden two 
workers digging a canal and several children are among the most 
recent victims of american cluster bombs dropped on laos during the 
vietnam war 
its been 15 years since the last american sorties were flown 
over this southeast asian nation but the death toll continues to 
mount american relief workers say 
buried in the jungle of this landlocked nation the 
fruitshaped bombs each about the size of a tennis ball still 
maim and kill 
although total casualty figures have not been compiled the 
american friends service committee and the mennonite central 
committee say hundreds have lost their lives or limbs to the 
devices since the end of the war 
since january american aid workers say the bombs have killed 
10 people and injured 12 others on laos plain of jars in may 
five bombs were found by a joint uslaotian team searching for 
the remains of americans missing in action at a crash site in 
savannakhet province 
nicknamed guavas or oranges by us troops or 
bombies by the laotians the antipersonnel devices were 
dropped during the 196473 air war over laos 
roger rumpf of american friends says the laotian government has 
not worked to clear the bombs 
rumpf said the once strategic plain of jars remains perhaps the 
most dangerous zone and large tracts of land can be farmed only at 
great risk 
during the war the united states dropped thousands of bombs on 
the area turning it into a moonscape laotians say two tons of 
bombs fell for every human being on the plain 
the area was a key communications and transport route between 
vietnam laos and thailand and was used by communist forces as a 
supply route 
the american friends service committee and the mennonite central 
committee the only american aid organizations allowed into 
communist laos to date operate here on a small scale 
local officials reportedly are eager for outside help but the 
central laotian government has rejected tentative offers for 
official american assistance the us congress for its part has 
given the cold shoulder to such proposals for aid 
rumpf has spent five years in laos since the 1975 communist 
victory over the usbacked vientiane government his group has 
provided farmers with 20000 shovels said to be far safer than 
hoes which tend to set off the bombs on impact 
the mennonites have offered to supply laotians with a 
custombuilt tractor with a special detonator for bomblittered 
fields but volunteers to drive the machine have been lacking 
now the mennonites are awaiting word from vientiane authorities 
on a program to set up bombclearing teams in each district of 
xiengkhouang province where the plain of jars is located 
the proposal was submitted a year ago 
rumpf said that with the passing of time the small bombs have 
become especially dangerous monsoon rains and erosion have driven 
some beneath the surface of fields while others float back up 
to the topsoil 
villagers find the weapons a good source of income the innards 
of the bombs are sold to the vietnamese as ball bearings for 
bicyles and casings are turned into wick lamps the metal from 
larger bombs is fashioned into household utensils 
statistics vary but standard histories say more bomb tonnage 
was dropped on laos than on any country in history sometimes cited 
is the figure 2 million tons more than the us unleashed in all 
of world war ii 
the plain of jars was ravaged as were areas along the vital 
communist supply route the ho chi minh trail in southern laos 
few buildings were left standing farm animals were killed by the 
thousands and refugees swarmed from these regions

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis is increasingly shifting the focus of his campaign to the 
general election this fall even though hes keeping up the 
pretense that the partys nominating strugggle isnt over yet 
we have not carried california in years he told an 
enthusiastic rally thursday night as he wrapped up a quick trip in 
advance of the states june 7 primary but this is the year 
were going to carry it 
dukakis made his prediction of victory in the republican bastion 
of orange county near los angeles going so far as to predict a 
victory over georeg bush there as well as statewide his aides said 
they thought that was doubtful but said dukakis decided to stop in 
orange county several weeks before the formal start of the fall 
campaign in hopes of minimizing bushs expected local victory and 
thus make california easier to win 
the massachusetts governor was wrapping up a western swing today 
with stops in albuquerque and texas the new mexico visit was in 
advance of the states june 7 primary 
but the decision to attend a barbeque in austin texas which 
held its primary march 8 was made with the fall campaign in mind 
dukakis was expected to receive the endorsements of several locally 
prominent officials as he continues the process of unifying the 
party for the general election campaign 
dukakis manuevering comes as fresh public opinion polls 
indcated he holds a substantial lead over the republican vice 
president 
a washington postabc survery published in fridays editions 
reported the massachusetts governor gaining the support of 53 
percent of those polled to 40 percent for bush 
dukakis dismissed the importance of the poll as he campaigned 
through california on thursday insisting for the record that he 
still is concentrating on his final four primaries against 
democratic rival jackson 
its not over yet he said of his nominating struggle with 
his sole remaining opponent even though he is expected to wrap up 
enough delegates on the final day of the primary season to clinch 
the nomination 
dukakis used his time thursday to depct himself as a 
progressive future oriented candidate 
he stopped at a companysponsored day care center in palo alto 
and issued a statement calling for expanded day care programs 
nationally he told employees of a hightech medical firm that he 
favors devoting a greater share of federal research and development 
funds to civilian work 
he also made a brief tour of a facility in irvine where lasers 
are developed for use in treatment of cancer and other disease and 
he and his wife kitty used a laser beam to burn their names into a 
honeydew melon 
in between at a news conference he renewed his demand for a 
full explanation of links between the cia and panamas military 
leader manuel antonio noriega who is under indictment on drug 
charges in the united states 
the vice president was asked a few weeks ago whether or not we 
were paying noriega he said i cant confirm or deny that 
hes not running for press spokesman of the cia said 
dukakis hes suppose to be running for president of the united 
states 
he said bush or president reagan should explain any links betwen 
the cia and noriega who are the people that were involved in 
drug running and profit skimming and who was it in this 
administration who thought that made sense

exercise is good for pregnant women but 
onethird of the 45 expectant mothers who pushed themselves to the 
limit in brief workouts slowed the heart rates of their unborn 
babies researchers say 
whether diminished heart rates hurt fetuses is unclear but it 
could deprive them of needed oxygen researchers said in a study in 
todays journal of the american medical association 
milder exercise doesnt have the same effect and the findings 
suggest that higher exercise levels than currently recommended are 
safe for pregnant women said lead researcher dr marshall w 
carpenter 
the study is encouraging that women can continue exercising 
during pregnancy at levels reminiscent of that before pregnancy 
he said in a telephone interview thursday 
on the other hand i would caution women against exceeding 145 
to 150 heartbeats a minute for their own heart rate because we 
dont know what effect it has on the fetus 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
recommends that an expectant mother not exercise beyond a level 
that raises her heart rate to 140 beats per minute carpenter said 
but that recommendation was largely precautionary and we can 
give women a little more latitude than before he said 
the 45 women in the study were 4 months to 7 months pregnant 
and had an average age of 29 
fetal heart rates were measured at moderate and maximum exercise 
levels by carpenter physiologist stanley p sady and other 
researchers at brown university 
they found that maximum exercise when women peddled stationary 
bicycles against increasing resistance until they were unwilling or 
unable to continue produced brief episodes of slowed heart rates 
in 15 fetuses 
two other fetuses experienced slowed heart rates linked to 
moderate exercise they said 
the researchers believe any oxygen shortage was mild because 
tests given the unborn babies 30 minutes after the initial 
measurements were normal 
the slowed heart rates did not appear to give rise to later 
problems the researchers said three of the 45 infants studied as 
fetuses died within five weeks of birth but of apparently 
unrelated causes 
some of the studys subjects had exercised vigorously on a 
regular basis before becoming pregnant and some had not but that 
did not appear to affect fetal heartbeats the researchers said 
dr robert l jones a researcher at pennsylvania state 
university college of medicine in hershey said in a telephone 
interview that the most important consideration is tailoring the 
level of exercise to the individual

the reagan administrations plans for 
random drug testing of all federal prison employees have been put 
on hold for three weeks more by a judge 
us district judge stanley weigel on thursday extended the 
restraining order to june 16 the order had been sought in a 
lawsuit by the american federation of government employees the 
countrys largest federal workers union 
the testing was to have started last monday weigel issued a 
temporary restraining order may 20 saying constitutional problems 
were raised by testing lawabiding employees not suspected of 
wrongdoing 
the delay has triggered a hiring freeze by the bureau of 
prisons said justice department lawyer richard lepley lepley 
noting that the agency has tested job applicants since 1984 asked 
weigel to exempt applicants from his order 
the judge did not make an immediate decision 
the program stems from president reagans 1986 order that 
federal employees in sensitive jobs receive drug testing the 
prisons agency was one of the first agencies scheduled to begin 
testing and the first to order random tests for all employees on 
the theory that all hold sensitive jobs 
the union which claims 9400 prison employees among its 750000 
members contends in its suit that testing without suspicion of 
drug use by an individual violates constitional standards for 
unreasonable search 
the suit also claims violations of federal laws forbidding 
discrimination against the handicapped and requiring that employee 
discipline be related to job performance 
union attorney joe goldberg said thursday that the governments 
safety justifications were a smokescreen this program was not 
designed for safety goldberg said 
testing was developed as a political reaction to 
administration frustration at its inability to curb drug 
importation he said federal employees were an available 
scapegoat 
lepley acknowledged that testing does not directly measure 
inability to do a job but said it could reveal the potential for 
abusing drugs would discourage employees from using them and would 
help keep drugs out of prisons 
prison employees have a reduced expectation of privacy he said 
in a separate suit the union has challenged the entire drug 
testing program which would cover 345000 employees in 40 agencies 
another suit was filed in the same court thursday by an employee 
group the overseas education association challenging plans for 
random drug testing of more than 9600 teachers in schools run by 
the defense department for us military dependents in 20 countries

the government plans to renovate the ancient 
palace of the dalai lama that overlooks the tibetan capital of 
lhasa at an estimated cost of 8 million an official newspaper 
reported today 
the china daily said portions of the potala palace have been 
cracked or damaged by worms over the centuries it said more than 
1 million was spent on repairs in 1981 but that this was far 
from enough 
the planned renovation will include repairs to 720 square feet 
of frescoes the report said 
the vast potala palace which now includes hundreds of rooms 
stacked 13 stories high was begun in the 7th century as a 
pavilion it was greatly enlarged in the 17th century 
it includes living quarters for the dalai lama tibets 
traditional godking mausoleums of seven previous dalai lamas 
ceremonial halls treasure store rooms government offices a 
prison and a monastery 
since 1959 however when the current dalai lama fled to india 
only a few monks have been allowed to remain in the potala and it 
serves mainly as a museum for tourists 
the dalai lama fled china during a failed uprising by thousands 
of tibetans against communist chinese rule imposed nine years 
earlier 
most of the temples and religious sites in tibet were destroyed 
or badly damaged by radical bands of red guards during chinas 
cultural revolution from 196676 
tibetan activists claim beijing is renovating the temples now to 
lure more foreigners to lhasa and profit from their tourist dollars 
the activists have staged two large demonstrations over the past 
year in lhasa calling for an independent tibet both were crushed 
by chinese authorities

azt could make aids patients less infectious 
to their sexual partners according to researchers who found high 
levels of the virusfighting drug in the semen of patients treated 
with it 
however the university of minnesota researchers caution in 
todays journal of the american medical association that larger and 
more detailed studies are needed to determine if azt can reduce the 
risk of spreading the virus 
our worst scenario is that some patients taking azt will 
decide that they no longer need to follow existing safersex 
recommendations said dr henry balfour a university of 
minnesota virologist and a member of the research team 
researchers are trying to learn whether the drug even lowers the 
amount of aids virus in the semen said study author dr keith 
henry who is with the st paul health department if so said 
henry it raises the possibility that azt could lower the risk of 
virus transmission to sexual partners 
health experts strongly urge people who even suspect that they 
may have the aids virus to forgo sexual intercourse or at least to 
use a condom to reduce the risk of the virus spreading 
at best azt probably would reduce rather than eliminate the 
risk of the virus spreading and no one yet knows by how much 
henry explained the abstinenceorcondom recommendations are 
expected to continue as the first line of defense regardless of 
what further studies find he added 
semen has been the primary means by which the aids virus has 
been transmitted since the epidemic began in 1981 infected blood 
is the other major transmission route 
azt is not a cure for aids but its the only drug so far that 
has shown a clearcut ability to extend some aids patients lives 
it is being taken by at least 25000 people who have the aids 
virus balfour said 
the minnesota study found that the level of azt in six patients 
was typically several times higher in their semen than in their 
blood these azt levels would be enough to keep the virus from 
multiplying in a test tube but balfour said the results might be 
different in the body 
in addition the drug isnt designed to get rid of all the 
virus only to keep it from growing he said 
three of the patients in the study have aids and three others 
were ill with less severe symptoms called arc or aidsrelated 
complex 
the study was the first major look at how azt concentrates in 
body fluids other than blood the researchers said

a top soviet arms control official today called on 
the united states to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut 
longrange nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of 
compromise 
viktor karpov head of the soviet foreign ministrys arms 
control department and a former chief negotiator at geneva arms 
talks told the tass news agency the united states had agreed to 
compromise on several key issues but then backed off 
as soon as an issue reaches the american delegation in geneva 
it gets stuck there karpov complained 
he said that president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev agreed at their meeting in washington last december to 
abide by the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the soviet side has received more than one assurance from 
washington that they are prepared to fulfill this condition but 
things havent moved any further karpov said 
the abm treaty is a key hangup in negotiations on a treaty to 
cut arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles 
karpov also said the united states had not responded to soviet 
proposals on sealaunched missiles 
we believe that no bans on restrictions may be allowed when it 
comes to verification concerning this kind of missiles but the 
united states is not prepared for such an extensive verification 
system he said 
there has been no specific proposals coming from them only 
excuses karpov said 
he said the united states was not prepared to give up its 
advantage in airborne cruise missiles 
karpov said the united states had effectively given notice that 
it will not be ready to sign an agreement on strategic weapons at 
the fourth summit meeting between reagan and gorbachev next week 
in moscow 
it will be essential to give precise instructions to the 
delegations from the ussr and the us in geneva to keep 
working intensively to hammer out the issues remaining in the 
problem of strategic offen arms as soon as possible he said

in the season 
taking franks place off the schedule was one of the 
toughest decisions i had to make said lemasters its an 
extraordinary show but what it boiled down to was would i put it 
on the schedule to be bounced around or would i take the heat and 
hold it for an advantageous time period

muscovites polled on the eve of the summit 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev showed 
a lingering mistrust of us policies and found reagan a puzzle 
according to a poll published today 
of the 939 moscow adults surveyed this month for the new york 
times and cbs news 52 percent said us policies present a 
threat to the security of the soviet union twentynine percent 
said they did not 
residents of the soviet capital find reagan puzzling according 
to the telephone poll more said their impressions were favorable 
than unfavorable 24 percent to 18 percent but about half did not 
venture an opinion 
gorbachev and reagan are to meet next week in moscow 
the respondents were firmly behind gorbachevs drive to improve 
the soviet union seventyeight percent supported his domestic 
policies completely and 19 percent less than completely 
however many of those surveyed reacted warily to telephone 
questions from strangers in a country where historically a freely 
expressed opinion could mean time in a siberian labor camp the 
times said others seemed to reply mechanically with responses they 
deemed politically correct 
the interviews were conducted by the institute of sociological 
research of the soviet academy of sciences on may 7 8 14 and 15 
the margin of error for the poll was 4 percentage points meaning 
results could vary 4 points either way 
respondents especially liked gorbachevs calls for greater 
democracy and openness many said they wanted liberalization to 
include competitive elections private publishing and tolerance of 
public demonstrations the times said 
however only about half said they have seen tangible benefits 
from his program of economic reform 
only 40 percent said they expected their expected their 
families standard of living to improve in the next five years 
eighteen percent predicted it would worsen

south africas foreign minister criticized us 
sanctions against his country during an interview on american 
television but his apartheid opponent archbishop desmond tutu 
called for tougher steps 
foreign minister roelof pik botha and tutu the noble peace 
prizewinning anglican prelate were interviewed separately on 
abctvs nightline show thursday 
tutu criticized the united states for failing to take tougher 
steps against south africa to induce that country to abandon 
apartheid the policy of racial separation 
we are saying look in south africa many of the things that 
you hold dear are being treated with considerable disdain why 
dont you do something that will indicate to the south african 
government and to the victims that you actually do mean what you 
say tutu said 
botha meanwhile claimed that in general black south 
africans have more effective civil rights than black americans 
you do not want to have a proper analysis of our dilemma 
botha said you simply ascribe to us the worst motives we appeal 
to the black americans to try to understand that in many instances 
black south africans enjoy better medical facilities better 
housing facilities better education and greater prospects of 
powersharing than black americans will ever enjoy 
tutu said that despite the south african governments relaxation 
or elimination of some apartheid policies those steps have not 
come about as a result of any significant conversion on their part 
political power still remains very firmly in the hands of the 
white minority and until we deal with that problem we are playing 
marbles 
responding to a question about whether economic sanctions were 
effective he said if in fact sanctions are as ineffective as we 
are being led to believe why are the south african government the 
private sector jumping around like scalded cats as if they had 
ants in their pants 
botha argued that the sanctions and the withdrawal of some 
industries mean robbing our black people of jobs of sending 
their families into starvation 
he claimed a poll had shown that 75 percent of his countrys 
blacks opposed sanctions when asked why the government would not 
allow blacks to express such views by allowing them to vote botha 
denied that blacks are being denied political power

a us immigration official says ferdinand 
marcos should be allowed to return to the philippines for his 
mothers funeral a remark that drew a rebuke from a philippine 
official 
the deposed philippine president reiterated his desire to return 
to his homeland as he ended a twoday stay thursday at st francis 
medical center for treatment of chest pains 
harold ezell regional commissioner for the immigration and 
naturalization service met with marcos chief spokesman arturo 
aruiza shortly afterward and said he thought marcos should be 
allowed to attend his mothers burial 
whether or not you agree with everything thats happened 
there is still a factor that ferdinand marcos is a human being who 
had a mother who has passed away ezell said after accepting a 
letter from aruiza requesting approval for the return 
the politics the government decisions sometimes have to be 
weighed separately from that he said 
but ezell said the final decision rests with philippine 
president corazon aquino mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos 
back calling him a national security risk 
the philippine consul general in hawaii criticized ezell 
i thought his behavior was rather irregular said tomas 
gomez he is a public official who is supposed to react to a 
bureaucratic process he didnt have to editorialize 
ezell said he sympathized with marcos situation because ezells 
father died about a year ago 
before his release from the hospital marcos told reporters that 
mrs aquino should back down from her claim that he poses a threat 
ive told them i will not bother them but will hold back 
the people from starting violence marcos said while seated in a 
wheelchair 
marcos 70 was accompanied by his wife imelda several aides 
a nurse and his physician dr azucena ignacio who said marcos was 
fit to travel 
ignacio said arthritis or inflammation in the area of the left 
sixth rib caused marcos chest pains marcos improved dramatically 
with rest and was being treated with a painkiller she said 
aruizas letter contained a list of 71 people for whom marcos 
wants officials to grant permission to go to the philippines for 
the funeral of josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 at age 95 
william craig the ins district director said the 71 also 
requested permission to reenter the united states if allowed to 
travel to the philippines 
marcos is under a prevent departure notice which means he 
needs permission to leave the united states craig said 
ezell and craig said the letter would be forwarded to washington 
for consideration included in the list were marcos his wife son 
ferdinand marcos jr and daughter irene araneta 
a state department official in washington speaking on condition 
of anonymity said the united states would not consider any marcos 
trip without the approval of the aquino government 
according to the philippine department of immigration and 
deportation 16 of the 71 on the list are covered by a hold 
order that prevents them from leaving the philippines should they 
return they include marcos his wife and two children

a retired farmer who admitted killing 
his wife to end her suffering from alzheimers disease wept as he 
asked a judge to place him in a nursing home instead of sending him 
to prison 
but the judge apparently unmoved on thursday sentenced oscar 
carlson 78 to serve at least 28 months of a 43month prison 
sentence for the feb 29 shooting of his 71yearold wife agnes 
in an evansville nursing home 
i havent got many years left maybe not many days either 
carlson said before sentencing his voice faltering i hope you 
will put me in a home someplace where i can be of some good to 
somebody 
carlson told douglas county district judge paul ballard that he 
was so sorry for what happened to his wife of 45 years 
he was to begin serving his time at the stillwater state prison 
as soon as his transfer could be arranged from the douglas county 
jail said defense attorney michael dolan 
hes a frail old man placed in a system with violent people 
said dolan 
however douglas county attorney ann carrott said justice was 
served by the fact he was imprisoned 
with good behavior carlson would be eligible for parole in 28 
months 
carlson pleaded guilty several weeks ago to seconddegree murder 
after ballard said he would consider a prison sentence of no more 
than 43 months or 28 months with good behavior the agreement 
departs from state sentencing guidelines which call for an 18year 
sentence for seconddegree murder 
ms carrott opposed even the 43month sentence although she 
said she felt compassion toward carlson she said she believes 
sentencing guidelines should be followed 
the prosecutor said defense attorneys did not confer with her on 
the plea arrangement and said sentencing carlson to anything less 
than 18 years would set a dangerous precedent 
however carlsons other attorney thomas reif said were 
talking about a man whos never even had a traffic ticket before 
this i do not think sending him to prison at his age would serve 
society at all 
during a presentence hearing carlson said he snapped when he 
learned feb 28 that his wife had broken her hip and would have to 
be hospitalized the next day he took an old pistol to the 
crestview manor nursing home and shot her four times 
i just cracked up i just couldnt take no more carlson 
said 
relatives said the carlson family was devastated by mrs 
carlsons death but had forgiven carlson 
hes still our father and we understand it was hard on him 
said mildred penuel of fargo nd carlsons youngest daughter 
alzheimers disease causes progressive memory loss and mental 
degeneration

a female friend of laurie dann who killed 
one child and wounded six people during a shooting rampage has 
been charged with making harassing telephone calls similar to the 
ones dann was accused of police said 
sheri l taylor 34 of suburban highwood was arrested at the 
local convenience store where she worked and later surrendered a 
357 magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where she lived 
winnetka police chief herbert timm said thursday 
taylor was charged with threatening her former husband over the 
telephone timm said before her death friday dann had also been 
accused of threatening her exhusband 
taylor was arrested late wednesday by a localcounty task force 
investigating danns background timm said she was involuntarily 
committed to a psychiatric unit at rushpresbyterianst lukes 
medical center in chicago for treatment 
we should let the psychiatrists examine her and then decide 
what should be done said lisa howard a spokeswoman for cook 
county states attorneys office 
last friday dann started a small fire in a home shot six 
children at hubbard woods elementary school killing one and then 
shot and wounded a 20yearold man at a nearby home she then shot 
and killed herself 
at a news conference timm identified taylor as a very close 
friend of laurie dann he said taylors exhusband had warned 
that she might be a threat to him to herself and this 
community 
it was extremely obvious that this was a serious situation we 
are concerned with the safety of the taylor family we wanted 
to prevent another tragedy timm said 
dann and taylor had been roommates about a year ago and also had 
a distant family connection said assistant states attorney randy 
stewart 
timm said there is no evidence that taylor had any connection 
with danns violent rampage or helped her make threatening calls 
we are in the process of determining the extent of ms 
taylors involvement with laurie dann timm said 
in another development thursday an fbi official in madison 
wis said dann apparently acted alone in obtaining the poison she 
used to lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she 
sent or delivered to acquaintances before going on her winnetka 
shooting spree 
nobody else has surfaced as an accomplice based on the 
investigation we did here said charles steinmetz supervisor of 
the fbis madison office 
authorities are investigating whether dann sent her former 
husband russell dann an envelope containing fruit juice that was 
found wednesday at a highland park post office 
also thursday one of the children shot by dann was released 
from evanston hospital and the most seriously injured victim 
8yearold lindsay fisher was upgraded to fair condition two 
other children were in good condition at the hospital two other 
shooting victims were in fair condition at highland park hospital 
taylor was arrested on two outstanding warrants on a new 
charge of threatening the life of her exhusband scott taylor and 
their children who live with their father and an old charge of 
failing to appear on a drunken driving charge in evanston timm 
said 
taylors exhusband signed the complaint against her because he 
was concerned about his familys safety and feared that taylor 
might harm herself winnetka police sgt gene kalvaitis said

the communist partys policymaking central 
committee says the kremlin has in the past wrongly stressed 
military over diplomatic solutions to world problems and that its 
foreign policy is no longer dogmatic 
a position paper approved by the 300plus member body also 
sharply criticizes the role the party has come to occupy in soviet 
society saying bureaucrats are too often impeding the 
effectiveness of government bodies 
it proposes limiting party officials to two fiveyear terms 
with exceptions that could include mikhail s gorbachev and says 
elections for party jobs should be by secret ballot with more than 
one candidate 
the report will serve as the foundation for an extraordinary 
party conference that begins june 28 the first such gathering 
since 1941 its details were distributed thursday by the official 
tass news agency 
approved monday it sets the agenda for a possible showdown 
between reformers led by gorbachev and conservatives resisting 
change 
the report says foreign policy before gorbachev came to power 
trailed behind fundamental changes that occurred in the world and 
missed chances to reduce tensions and enhance understanding among 
nations 
praising changes made by the soviet leader it said kremlin 
foreign policy now addresses problems of a world faced with nuclear 
destruction while not imposing any conditions or dogmas on 
anyone 
the new soviet approach has led to a definite improvement in 
relations with the united states and a fresh discovery of the 
soviet union in other countries the central committee report says 
in our bid for militarystrategic parity we occassionally 
failed to use opportunities available to attain security for our 
nation by political means and as a result allowed ourselves to 
be lured into an arms race which could not but affect this 
countrys social and economic progress and its standing on the 
international scene the report says 
on domestic policy the program strongly reflects gorbachevs 
priorities for increasing citizen involvement in public affairs and 
making individuals more accountable its passage shows that the man 
who rose to party chief in march 1985 was able to muster the vital 
support of the central committee 
gorbachev was named to present the party program at the meeting 
next month at which 5000 delegates will pass judgment on his 
reforms 
the program indicates the communists still lay claim to being 
the most important force in soviet society and the only legal 
political party but it says communist authorities have seriously 
weakened local governing bodies and the party itself by seeking to 
dominate nearly all aspects of life 
the rights and powers of the representative bodies have been 
curtailed and they remain under unwarranted tutelage from party 
committees the report says with governing councils often left 
to rubberstamp decisions already made at higher levels 
the result has sharpened many social development problems 
the report said it is vital to change this situation radically 
the report says changes must extend to the supreme soviet the 
nominal parliament which finished a threeday session in the 
kremlin on thursday 
party documents call for an increase in the number of days the 
governing councils work urge that members be relieved of work 
obligations to attend such sessions and that the meetings be open 
to the public and the media 
the report indicates that those who do not support gorbachevs 
reforms will be purged from the 19 millionmember party 
gorbachev in january 1987 called on the party to implement 
procedures to ensure that new blood is brought into the leadership 
but he ran into resistance

cardinal joseph bernardin urged roman catholics 
and noncatholics to oppose efforts to legalize euthanasia but 
said opponents must work for alternatives for the incurably ill 
such as hospices 
as individuals and as a society we have the positive 
obligation to protect life bernardin said in a speech thursday 
to the center for clinical medical ethics at the university of 
chicago hospitals and clinics 
we have the negative obligation not to destroy or injure human 
life directly especially the life of the innocent and vulnerable 
bernardin suggested that funding for hospice programs in 
hospitals or patients homes could come from insurance or public 
sources 
in this way we can eliminate many of the legitimate concerns 
that may motivate people to consider euthanasia which otherwise 
would be unacceptable to them and society he said 
the cardinal said his position against mercy killing does not 
include keeping alive by extraordinary medical procedures or 
machines those who should be allowed a natural death 
he said he was convinced that we are not morally obliged to do 
everything that is technically possible to keep terminally ill 
patients alive in other words there are cases where we would 
not be obliged to provide nutrition and hydration 
he said the challenge was to develop a public policy to 
protect against an attitude that could erode respect for the 
inviolable dignity of human life 
but such a policy should not create categories or priorities of 
people whose lives no longer need be protected he said 
the cardinal said his remarks were prompted by the increased 
public discussion of euthanasia following advances in medical 
technology that can artificially prolong a patients life 
the issue has been widely debated since the chicagobased 
journal of the american medical association published a letter in 
january by an anonymous doctor describing the mercy killing of a 
terminally ill cancer patient 
the fear then of the pain and discomfort of a life prolonged 
inappropriately has led to an erosion of the natural instinct to 
preserve ones life the cardinal said 
in certain critical decisions involving living and dying many 
perceive that the focus of concern many no longer be the good of 
the patient but what will best protect the doctor and hospital 
from legal action he said

nato defense ministers today pledged to 
renew efforts to share equitably in the costs of their common 
defense congress has been complaining that the european allies are 
not pulling their weight 
we are determined in ensuring that each of us contributes 
in the most effective and equitable fashion to natos joint 
defense efforts the ministers said in a statement at the end of 
their twoday meeting here 
they authorized nato officials in brussels to launch an indepth 
review of the responsibilities of the 16 member nations to 
determine what changes if any must be made the study is to be 
completed by the end of the year 
in their statement us defense secretary frank carlucci and 
the other north atlantic treaty organization defense chiefs also 
expressed support for president reagan in his summit talks next 
week in moscow 
the review of natos burdensharing arrangement comes amid 
increasingly harsh criticism from some us lawmakers criticism 
the european allies counter by saying their contributions are being 
grossly underestimated 
the important thing about burdensharing is that it not 
degenerate to a fingerpointing exercise carlucci told reporters 
after the meeting 
he said all nato nations are committed to maintaining their 
defense spending and making better use of available funds 
the ministers also asked italy to host a us jetfighter wing 
that spain wants off its soil within three years 
all of us hope that the italian government and parliament will 
be able to accept the 72 nuclearcapable f16 jetfighters nato 
secretary general lord carrington said a favorable italian 
decision is expected soon 
the planes carrington said represent a considerable portion 
of our strength in the southern region they make up the us air 
forces 401st tactical fighter wing now based at the torrejon air 
base near madrid 
the pentagon has said it will have to disband the unit unless a 
final decision on moving the planes to another european base is 
made by august 
carrington told reporters that hesitation by the allies in 
arranging the transfer of the f16s would have had the most 
appalling effect on alliance relations and us congressional 
attitudes toward europe 
a decision on a specific italian site for the planes is to be 
made later 
carlucci estimated the cost of relocating the planes at about 
500 million 
the united states under an accord reached in january with 
spain must remove its f16s from the torrejon base by 1991 
us officials were hopeful the decision to keep the f16s in 
europe would help blunt congressional complaints the europeans 
dont pay enough for nato 
washington spends 67 percent of its gross national product to 
maintain the alliance compared with a 33 percent average for the 
europeans 
the european allies argue a comparison of money figures is 
unfair because some of europes contributions to nato are hard to 
quantify 
these include the fact that west germany and other countries 
suffer extensive environmental damage from the intense 
concentration of troops and armaments on their soil 
the europeans have released figures showing that of natos 
active duty forces europe provides 90 percent of the troops and 
artillery 80 percent of the tanks and jetfighters and twothirds 
of the major warships 
the nato defense ministers said they have found no evidence 
moscow is changing the doctrine and structure of soviet forces 
the ministers said the soviet union continues to maintain 
military forces in excess of its defensive needs 
soviet military expenditures are estimated to represent some 
15 to 17 percent of its gnp the continuing growth of soviet 
military capabilities provides a persuasive reminder of the need 
for a credible defense on natos part the ministers said in 
their communique 
carlucci said despite their rhetoric we have yet to see any 
change in soviet military outlays or in the composition of soviet 
forces

the body of a reputed mobster was found in a 
body bag floating in the hackensack river with two bullet holes 
behind his ear and a credit card left behind to signal his 
identity authorities said 
the body of john digilio a flamboyant exboxer who was a friend 
of heavyweight champions muhammad ali and joe frazier was found in 
the river by the new york suburb of carlstadt on thursday said 
bergen county prosecutor larry mcclure 
sometimes when you live by the sword you die by the sword 
said jeff bronster a justice department attorney who prosecuted 
digilio in a recent waterfront racketeering case 
the corpse was decomposed beyond recognition but digilio was 
wearing the same clothes he had on when his wife reported him 
missing may 7 and authorities were able to confirm his identity 
through fingerprints mcclure said 
after the 55yearold bayonne man was reported missing 
authorities said their sources indicated the reputed genovese crime 
family soldier had been the victim of gangland violence 
the former longshoreman was a colorful figure who frequently 
spoke with reporters successfully acted as his own attorney in the 
racketeering case often invited his boxing friends to the 
courtroom and filed a harassment suit against federal officials 
authorities believe that flamboyance may have prompted mob 
colleagues unhappy with the attention to seek digilios elimination 
digilio was also to be sentenced on a state loansharking 
conviction may 19 
his body was found inside a zipped morticians bag with two 
bullet holes behind the ear state police said a visa card was 
found between digilios legs so that whoever recovered the body 
would be able to identify it said mcclure 
mob experts have said it was likely digilios death would be 
made known to serve as a warning to others 
authorities alleged the former middleweight boxer controlled 
loan sharking and labor rackets on the hudson river waterfront and 
had extended his influence into bergen county to the north 
last april a jury acquitted him of extorting money from a 
stevedore company on the bayonne waterfront in exchange for labor 
peace 
digilio was convicted of loan sharking last october after 
remaining free for 10 years through a series of delays most of 
them connected to claims of ill health and mental instability 
he was cleared in 1986 of violating a probationary sentence for 
his 1975 conviction for arranging the theft of his fbi file his 
only other conviction he served nine months in jail for the file 
theft

a little miracle who barely filled an 
adults hand when she was born 17 weeks premature last january 
should be able to leave the hospital in about two weeks doctors 
say 
ashley lynn cunningham seems to have escaped the problems that 
often plague premature babies doctors said thursday 
ashley who weighed just 15 ounces at birth now weighs 3 
pounds 15 ounces and measures 16 inches she has color in her 
cheeks can hold her head up and cries frequently although very 
softly 
when she was born doctors were uncertain whether she would 
survive more than a few days had things gone according to plan 
ashley would have been born today 
shes really a little miracle said deborah blair a nurse 
in the neonatal intensive care unit at childrens medical center 
ashleys home since birth 
ashley should go home in about two weeks said dr ronald e 
hoekstra a specialist on newborns at the hospital 
the smallest premature infant to survive in the united states 
weighed 15 ounces according to hoekstra 
although ashleys eyes are not fully developed doctors dont 
believe she will have any problems with sight 
she has not experienced any hemorrhaging in her brain another 
common problem with premature babies and doesnt appear to have 
any serious breathing difficulties though she lived on a 
respirator for 77 days her skin thin at birth has developed and 
will protect her from infection hoekstra said 
it appears she will live a normal healthy life although her 
progress will be monitored by doctors periodically until she is 7 
hoekstra said 
five years ago ashley probably would not have lived long enough 
to go home hoekstra said he said technological advances and 
bettertrained doctors have made it possible to treat infants such 
as ashley 
ashleys grandmother joan cunningham said she cant count the 
prayers she and family members have said for ashley in the past 
four anxietyfilled months ashleys medical bills stand at about 
224000 and will be covered by insurance hospital officials said

helsinki finland ap president reagan emerging from 
presummit isolation today appealed to soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to enter the western house of democracy by embracing 
the values enshrined in the 1975 helsinki agreement 
sounding the human rights theme he will stress in their talks in 
moscow reagan praised gorbachevs glasnost and the openness 
that has flourished in his three years at the kremlin helm 
but while dissidents are released from labor camps and books and 
movies criticizing the communist system gain currency the 
president said soviet practice does not or does not yet 
measure up to soviet commitment 
in the 1975 accord with 34 other nations the soviets pledged to 
provide more liberty for their people and those in eastern europe 
and yet 13 years later reagan said the cases of divided families 
and blocked marriages remain on the eastwest agenda while 
russians trying to emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and 
arbitrary rulings 
and what are we to think of the continued suppression of those 
who wish to practice their religious beliefs the president asked 
reagan spoke in a prepared speech to a finnish audience in 
finlandia hall where the helsinki final agreement was signed in 
1975 
he said he welcomed every sign that the soviets and their allies 
are ready to adopt western values 
the house of democracy is a house whose doors are open to 
all reagan said 
as he spoke jewish groups gathered in the finnish capital to 
mount public pressure on moscow in behalf of sovie jews waiting for 
exit permits and those seeking wider latitude to teach and practice 
their religion 
a friday evening sabbath service was planned outside a lutheran 
church in an ecumencial display of unity

finnish president mauno koivisto 
as photographers spun into action mrs reagan plucked yellow 
daisies from the luncheon flower arrangement the president proudly 
wore one as a boutonniere and mrs reagan pinned one on koivistos 
lapel 
reagan played down the significance of the soviet decision to 
cancel one of his meetings with gorbachev we only had four 
meetings at our summit in washington he told reporters we 
have to recognize that their government has normal business that 
has to be conducted and we have to schedule accordingly thats 
what we did when the summit was in our town 
asked if he thought there was anything more important than his 
visit with the soviet leader reagan said i dont think theres 
anything more important as far as im concerned but they have 
business to do 
the president responding to questions about soviets objections 
to some of the people he planned on meeting with in moscow 
responded simply we do the best we can 
in other summitrelated developments 
a top soviet arms control official in moscow called on the 
united states to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut 
longrange nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of 
compromise

control department and a former chief negotiator at geneva arms 
talks told the tass news agency the united states had agreed to 
compromise on several key issues but then backed off 
as soon as an issue reaches the american delegation in geneva 
it gets stuck there he complained 
and an aide to gorbachev charged that the united states is 
violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to 
afghanistans anticommunist mujahedeen guerrillas 
they are arming quite openly those who want to go on in 
their civil war said yevgeny primakov who is head of the 
institute for the world economy and has acted as a key adviser to 
gorbachev on afghanistan 
before reagan spoke us jewish activists for soviet jews urged 
the president to remind the soviets that human rights were 
indirectly linked to progress in arms control 
morris b abram chairman of the national council for soviet 
jewry said jewish emigration is a test of whether arms 
reductions can succeed 
any agreement depends on trust and credibility he told a 
news conference no one asks for direct linkage 
abram called the improvement in jewish emigration figures 
insignificant compared with those who wish to leave its 
smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned 
the council an umbrella organization of us jewish groups 
active for soviet jewry brought a 50member delegation to helsinki 
to draw attention to the issue 
the 1975 helsinki agreement signed by the united states canada 
and 33 european nations including the soviet union initially was 
viewed skeptically by american political conservatives because it 
implicitly accepts east european boundaries set after world war ii 
in moscows favor 
but in the years since the helsinki agreement has served as a 
western platform for chastising the soviets for deficiencies on 
human rights 
meanwhile in washington the us senate today moved toward 
ratification of the historic treaty that reagan and gorbachev 
signed at their december summit eliminating medium range nuclear 
missiles 
senate leaders said they had the votes to approve the pact 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr was set to rush the 
treaty to the president for a ceremonial exchange of the 
ratification documents with gorbachev 
human rights is one of reagans themes in his fourth summit with 
gorbachev the president plans to meet monday with soviet activists 
and refuseniks to underscore his concern 
word reached the presidential party thursday that the soviets 
had questioned the participation of one of the religious groups 
scheduled to meet with reagan at the danilov monastery on monday 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said he did not know 
which religious group the soviets objected to the meeting said 
fitzwater is still on as far as i know 
on the official level the soviets have shown no concern over 
the meeting at a press conference thursday to discuss the summit 
deputy foreign minister vladimir f petrovsky said the us 
president is certainly free to decide who of soviet citizens he 
finds interesting and useful to meet with outside the framework of 
the official events 
but he added this american move is hardly aimed at improving 
mutual understanding between the usa and ussr 
refuseniks demonstrating in moscow on thursday said they want 
human rights to figure prominently in the reagangorbachev meetings 
a leningrad refusenik roald alec zelichonok said in a 
telephone interview that kgb secret police has warned him against 
accepting an invitation to meet reagan on monday 
zelichonok who has been refused permission to emigrate for more 
than 10 years said he received a letter and telephone call tuesday 
from the us embassy inviting him to take part in the meeting with 
reagan 
shortly after the embassy phone call he said a kgb officer 
telephoned and said in light of security measures around moscow 
my departure for moscow will not be permitted 
reagan in a presummit interview with west european 
journalists said he hopes to work out an agreement with gorbachev 
to give american psychiatrists access to soviet mental hospitals 
human rights groups have charged dissidents are committed and 
mistreated 
other advances in human rights at the summit were hinted by 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in a meeting in 
geneva with secretary of state george p shultz 
american officials said they reforms would probably ease 
restraints on religious practices and education

following the collapse of its negotiating 
effort the reagan administration is promoting a more active role 
for the central american democracies in encouraging panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega to surrender power 
i think its an excellent idea said undersecretary of state 
michael armacost noting that several central american countries 
have a tremendous storehouse of experience in the transition to 
civilian democratic rule 
armacost the state departments thirdranking official spoke 
thursday evening on the macneillehrer newshour after a day 
marked by highlevel consultations in washington and in a number of 
latin american capitals 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams said earlier that 
us ambassadors from around the hemisphere were instructed to 
sound out host governments on their ideas for negotiating a 
solution in panama 
panama was the subject of a senior level meeting thursday at the 
white house as well 
a unilateral us effort to negotiate noriega out of power 
failed on wednesday when the defense forces commander and de facto 
ruler backed out of a deal his representatives had negotiated with 
state department envoy michael kozak 
during a photo session in helsinki today with finnish president 
mauno henrik koivisto president reagan indicated that he and his 
advisers have reached no decisions about how to proceed on the 
panamanian problem 
we have had no opportunity to consider where we go he said 
in response to reporters questions 
reagan also sidestepped a question as to whether he would use 
military force in panama 
i cant answer as to what might be the possibilities reagan 
said saying it would be wrong to talk about options 
pressed to respond to abrams refusal to rule out the use of 
military force reagan said again i wont comment on the 
possibilities 
as part of a us plan to restore democratic rule in panama next 
year noriega was to step down this august and go into temporary 
exile in return federal drug smuggling indictments against him 
were to be dismissed 
noriegas rejection of the plan ended the negotiations and 
appeared to breathe new life into a central american initiative in 
which guatemalan president vinicio cerezo apparently would play the 
key role 
panamanian ambassador juan sosa who is allied with the 
antinoriega forces told reporters after a meeting with state 
department officials that diplomatic contacts had been made with 
cerezo after the collapse of the us effort 
cerezo assumed power two years ago as the first elected civilian 
president after more than 30 years of military or 
militarydominated governments in guatemala 
his washington ambassador oscar padilla told the newshour 
program that the central american family should initiate an 
effort to resolve the panamanian crisis 
joining with guatemala in any such effort would be the 
governments of costa rica honduras and el salvador all 
democracies with close links to the united states 
the administration has resisted significant involvement by other 
hemispheric governments in the panama issue but has now shifted 
its strategy somewhat after calling a halt to its own initiative 
while armacost indicated there would be a reduced us role in 
the future he noted that the federal indictments against noriega 
imply continued american participation in any effort to reach a 
settlement in panama 
although noriega has little overt support in latin america 
hemispheric nations have indicated deep reservations about the 
administrations approach to the problem 
one example of this was a meeting of 26 latin american countries 
two months ago at which a resolution was passed criticizing the 
us economic sanctions against panama

midnight was the switching hour for thousands of 
suburban illinois bell customers whose telephone service went up in 
flames on mothers day 
at 1159 pm thursday a technician punched a computer button 
at the firedamaged hinsdale switching station hooking up half of 
illinois bells 35000 hinsdalearea customers to a new digital 
switching system 
with that action these customers should have normal service 
again 2 weeks after the may 8 fire at the switching station a 
key part of the phone network for northern illinois bell spokesman 
tim bannon said thursday 
there might be some shakeout wrinkles but these people should 
have stateoftheart telephone service including clearer lines 
and such options as call waiting and call forwarding previously 
unavailable through the 20yearold equipment at the station 
bannon said 
the new equipment which normally takes 50 weeks to put into 
service was installed in just two weeks by about 250 illinois bell 
employees working day and night bannon said 
the rest of illinois bells hinsdalearea customers will 
continue to have problems calling outside the area and getting 
longdistance service until they can be connected to the new 
equipment in early june bannon said 
they remain hooked to the old equipment which sustained smoke 
and fire damage but has been kept operational as a stopgap measure 
the system is getting better but it is upsetting said ruth 
collins of burr ridge whose phone line was one of those on the 
old equipment you reach a point after a while where you are 
grateful for anything 
the fire disrupted service for hundreds of thousands of 
residents in chicagos western suburbs and totally cut off the 
35000 customers for at least a week 
bannon said virtually all of the longdistance circuits and 
special business lines transmitting computer data that had been 
routed through the hinsdale station had been restored although it 
would still take a few more days to correct some scattered problems

hundreds of syrian troops moved into 
beiruts southern slums today to end a threeweek bloodbath between 
rival shiite moslem militias 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and the 
syrianarmed amal militia stopped shooting as the deployment began 
syrias move was expected to increase pressure for the release 
of 18 foreign hostages including nine americans who are believed 
to be held in the slums by shiite factions linked to hezbollah 
hours after syria announced thursday that its troops would move 
in gunmen ambushed a car carrying four syrian generals all four 
escaped injury 
about 900 soldiers wearing bulletproof vests over their combat 
fatigues advanced on foot from beiruts airport highway into the 
ghobeiri and shiyah districts 
a halfhour earlier shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire 
in the embattled slums resounded across beirut police had no word 
on what touched off the flareup which occurred despite pledges by 
both factions to observe a ceasefire 
the syrians advanced in three groups each made up of 300 
infantrymen carrying machine guns and shoulderfired grenade 
launchers the first group was followed by 50 lebanese policemen 
carrying automatic rifles 
the syrians set up four or five checkpoints along a 
disengagement line between the amalheld shiyah neighborhood and 
hezbollahcontrolled ghobeiri 
wailing women greeted the syrians as they moved in by showering 
them with rice in a traditional gesture of welcome 
animals theyre all animals animals killing animals a man 
standing in front of his bombshattered house shouted in english 
when he saw western correspondents covering the syrian advance 
his house was seized by hezbollah fighters during the final 
phase of the savage street fighting that erupted may 6 police say 
296 people have been killed and 1000 wounded in the turf war 
there was no immediate word when the syrians planned to send 
tanks and other armor into the devastated districts to enforce the 
ceasefire 
syrias military intelligence chief in lebanon brig gen ghazi 
kenaan said syria would deploy 7500 soldiers in the 
16squaremile slums about 90 percent of which are controlled by 
hezbollah 
kenaan was one of four generals riding in a mercedes 500 that 
was hit by dozens of bullets as it traveled through ghobeiri on 
thursday neither the generals nor their bodyguards were hurt the 
syrians reported 
the attack came just hours after kenaan announced syrian forces 
would enter the slums today 
police said hezbollah militiamen raked kenaans bulletproof dark 
blue mercedes with machine gun fire as it drove through ghobieri 
according to police hezbollah forces claimed they were not 
notified that kenaans motorcade would be going through ghobeiri 
although police said notification was made 
also in the car were maj gen saeed bairakdar commander of 
syrias forces in lebanon brig gen ali hammoud chief of 
military intelligence for the beirut area and brig gen zuheir 
musattat 
president hafez assads syrian government announced on thursday 
that a truce agreement has been reached with all parties concerned 
including iran and hezbollah to end the carnage 
ending the fighting will create new hope for the hostages and 
syria will spare no effort to secure their release regardless of 
their nationality a syrian official told the associated press in 
damascus 
a source at the syrian command speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the deployment operation would be carried out in 
two stages today and saturday 
the first involves the establishment of buffer zones in key 
positions along the confrontation lines in the neighborhoods of 
shiyah ghobeiri mesharrafieh and haret hreik today he said 
the deployment in the rest of the slums would be completed on 
saturday including hezbollahs main strongholds of bir elabed and 
hay madi the source added 
the hostages are believed to be imprisoned in hezbollahs hay 
madi barracks 
both amal and hezbollah have said they would withdraw their 
fighters once the syrians move in and keep only political and 
information offices 
it was not clear whether the hostages were part of the truce 
deal but the iranian assistant foreign minister ali mohammed 
besharati predicted last week that the hostage problem would be 
solved after peace was restored in south beirut 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon embroiled in civil 
war for 13 years although an ally of iran it appears anxious that 
irans brand of islamic fundamentalism may be getting too much of a 
foothold in lebanon

cambodias provietnamese government 
urged the world today to respond to vietnams troop pullout by 
taking steps to prevent the khmer rouge from returning to power in 
cambodia 
vietnam said thursday it would withdraw its 50000 troops or 
what it said was half its force in cambodia between june and 
december as part of its plan of a complete pullout by 1990 the 
remaining troops are to be placed under the command of the 
provietnamese government it said 
a statement issued by the cambodian foreign ministry said today 
that attempts to help the khmer rouge return to power created a 
very dangerous obstacle to holding peace talks with the three 
cambodian guerrilla groups that oppose vietnams occupation the 
chinesebacked khmer rouge is the largest and most powerful of 
these groups 
it is imperative to absolutely eliminate this obstacle at a 
time when more than half the vietnamese volunteer troops have 
already been withdrawn from cambodia said the statement which 
was carried by the official cambodian radio monitored in bangkok 
it said the khmer rouge must be tried by the world court and 
also denied the use of sanctuaries in foreign territory 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 after a series of bloody 
border clashes with the communist khmer rouge government which 
killed millions of people during its nearly fouryear rule vietnam 
installed a prohanoi government 
the radio of the khmer rouge dismissed cambodias statement as 
propaganda and said it has never seen a single vietnamese soldier 
leave cambodia it urged the world to continue pressuring hanoi to 
withdraw all its forces unconditionally as demanded in annual 
united nations resolutions 
the cambodian government statement also said vietnams decision 
to pull its troops in cambodia 18 miles back from the thai border 
showed neighborly intentions that thailand should match vietnamese 
and thai forces frequently have clashed along the border 
thailand said vietnams decision to pull out of cambodia 
resulted from thai prime minister prem tinsulanondas talks last 
week with leaders in moscow 
thailand and its allies in the association of southeast asian 
nations are trying to arrange informal talks in indonesia among the 
warring cambodian factions vietnam and other concerned countries 
vietnams official radio hanoi said thursday the guerrillas and 
their backers should agree to a political settlement because the 
cambodian issue will no longer exist after 1990 when the last 
troops leave the provietnamese government increasingly is able to 
control the country by itself said a text of the broadcast 
obtained today 
it said the key issue is to guarantee that the khmer rouge 
doesnt return and that this is the responsibility of china the 
united states and the association of southeast asian nations 
vietnams withdrawal would be by far the largest of annual 
pullouts vietnam claims to have made since 1982 the previous 
withdrawals had already reduced by half the force that was 
originally in cambodia hanoi says

police commissioner kevin tucker who won 
wide praise for turning around a department reeling from corruption 
and the move disaster says he is resigning after 2 years to spend 
more time with his family 
commissioner tucker has brought integrity and pride to a 
department in crisis mayor w wilson goode said thursday in 
accepting the resignation he has left his significant mark of 
professionalism 
when tucker 48 a former secret service agent who spent two 
decades guarding government figures took over the 6700member 
force in 1986 morale was poor and the department was held in low 
esteem 
it was just seven months after the may 1985 confrontation with 
the radical group move in which police dropped a bomb that set fire 
to a neighborhood eleven people in the move house died and 61 
homes were destroyed 
morale also was suffering from the convictions of 34 officers 
including a deputy commissioner accused of taking bribes from vice 
figures 
tucker the first outsider in more than 60 years to head the 
department took the post saying he would stay two to three years 
it was a high honor and privilege to serve the city tucker 
said thursday our department has made progress we have moved 
forward together it has been a team effort with the officers the 
city and the public 
tucker said he wants to spend more time with his wife and two 
children who live in nearby medford lakes nj he said the citys 
residency requirements and the demands of the job allowed little 
time with his family 
he has been occupying a downtown apartment because of a law 
requiring city residence for all employees it personally took 
its toll he said 
tucker denied speculation that a budget shortfall for fiscal 
1989 which might result in police layoffs played any role in his 
resignation which is effective june 10 tucker has taken a job 
with a bank in philadelphia 
the mayor said he would appoint a successor from within the 
department among the leading candidates are the two deputy 
commissioners robert armstrong and willie williams 
if appointed williams would be philadelphias first black 
police commissioner 
tucker who was a police officer in rahway nj before joining 
the secret service in 1965 spent four years providing security for 
president kennedys widow jacqueline and her two children he was 
agent in charge of the philadelphia office before resigning in 1985 
for a job in private business

three iranian speedboats raided a maltese 
freighter today and left it burning in the strait of hormuz then 
fired at a press helicopter when it approached the site of the 
attack shipping executives said 
iran earlier claimed it killed or wounded 10000 iraqi troops in 
land battles east of basra 
the press helicopter chartered by the american television 
network cbs was not hit 
shipping executives had said a second ship was hit but later 
retracted that report 
the executives said the 18member crew of the 18000ton don 
miguel abandoned ship after the 8 am attack an omani warship 
sailing nearby rescued them 
the executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
crew all south koreans were transferred to a salvage tugboat of 
the dutch company smit and appeared to have been unharmed 
associated press photographer greg english who was aboard a 
helicopter in the area said a second smit salvage tugboat was 
battling the flames as they ravaged the freighters stern 
the executives said the iranians fired at the helicopter 
chartered by cbs when it tried to get close to the site of the 
attack but they said the four volleys of gunfire only hit the 
water and did not damage the aircraft 
it was the second iranian raid in 12 hours and the fourth in 10 
days 
on may 3 washington broadened the duties of the us navy in the 
gulf allowing american warships to intervene in attacks on 
commercial ships even if they are not sailing under the stars and 
stripes 
the executives said no american warships were believed to have 
been in the vicinity of the don miguel when it was raided 
all the recent iranian attacks took place near the iranian 
offshore larak oil terminal and all the ships were sailing to or 
from saudi arabian ports 
iraqi jets raided larak on may 14 hitting five tankers 
including the worlds largest the seawise giant 
iraq strikes irans oil facilities to pressure tehran into 
ending its 7yearold war with iraq iran retaliates by attacking 
neutral commercial shipping 
in the land battle tehran radio late thursday quoted a 
statement by irans revolutionary guards saying that in the 
fighting east of basra severe casualties were inflicted on the 
enemy and more than 10000 of them were killed or wounded 
it was the first time either side has reported any casualty 
figures in this weeks fighting centered in the area between 
basra a southern iraqi city and the iranian border town of 
shalamcheh 
western military analysts say an estimated 35000 to 40000 
iraqi troops took part in the operation retaking chunks of iraqi 
territory in the third military defeat for iran since midmay 
tehran radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp said 
iranian forces were continuing to resist the iraqis from new 
positions 
earlier the official islamic republic news agency monitored in 
cyprus admitted that iranian forces had to retreat from parts of 
the area they had captured earlier 
it said the iranians were now in new positions but gave no 
details in one of tehrans rare acknowledgements that it had 
suffered a military setback 
the radio also reported large numbers of volunteers were 
dispatched to the front from 19 cities across iran in the 24 hours 
following the iraqi offensive 
on april 18 iraq recaptured its faw peninsula which had been 
occupied by iranian forces since early 1986 on the same day us 
forces destroyed two iranian oil platforms and sank or damaged six 
iranian warships in the gulf

here is the text of president reagans 
speech at finlandia hall on friday 
thank you thank you all very much mr president mr speaker 
mr prime minister and ladies and gentlemen let me begin by 
saying thank you to our hosts the finnish government the 
paasikivi society and the league of finnishamerican societies 
its a particular honor for me to come here today this year 
the year of friendship as congress has proclaimed it between the 
united states and finland this year marks the 350th anniversary of 
the arrival of the first finns in america and the establishment of 
a small scandinavian colony near what is today wilmington delaware 
an ancient people in a new world 
and that is the story not only of those finns but of all the 
peoples who braved the seas to settle in and build my country a 
land of freedom for a nation of immigrants 
yes they founded a new world but as they crossed the oceans 
the mountains and the prairies those who made america carried the 
old world in their hearts the old customs the family ties and 
most of all the belief in god a belief that gave them the moral 
compass and ethical foundation by which they explored an uncharted 
frontier and constructed a government and nation of by and for the 
people 
and so although we americans became a new people we also remain 
an ancient one for were guided by ancient and universal values 
values that prime minister holkeri spoke of in los angeles this 
february when after recalling finlands internationally 
recognized position of neutrality he added that finland is tied to 
western values of freedom democracy and human rights and let me 
add here that for america those ties are also the bonds of our 
friendship 
america respects finlands neutrality we support finlands 
independence we honor finlands courageous history we value the 
creative statesmanship that has been finlands gift to world peace 
and in this soaring hall which is the great architect alvar altos 
statement of hope for finlands future we reaffirm our hope and 
faith that the friendship between our nations will be unending 
we are gathered here today in this hall because it was here 
almost thirteen years ago that the 35 nations of the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe signed the helsinki final act a 
document that embodies the same ethical and moral principles and 
the same hope for a future of peace that finns and so many other 
european immigrants gave america 
the final act is a singular statement of hope its three baskets 
touch on almost every aspect of eastwest relations and taken 
together form a kind of map through the wilderness of mutual 
hostility to open fields of peace and to a common home of trust 
among all of our sovereign nations neutrals nonaligned and 
alliance members alike the final act sets new standards of conduct 
for our nations and provided the mechanisms by which to apply those 
standards 
yes the final act goes beyond arms control once the focus of 
international dialogue it reflects a truth that i have so often 
noted nations do not distrust each other because they are armed 
they are armed because they distrust each other the final act 
grapples with the full range of our underlying differences and 
deals with eastwest relations as an interrelated whole 
it reflects the belief of all our countries that human rights 
are less likely to be abused when a nations security is less in 
doubt that economic relations can contribute to security but 
depend on the trust and confidence that come from increasing ties 
between our peoples increasing openness and increasing freedom 
and that there is no true international security without respect 
for human rights 
i can hardly improve on the words that president koivisto used 
in this hall two years ago when he recalled that security is more 
than the protection of borders and social structures it is 
emphasized in the final act that individual persons who live in the 
participating states have to feel in their own lives security which 
is based on respect for fundamental human rights and basic freedoms 
and beyond establishing these integrated standards the final 
act establishes a process for progress it sets up a review 
procedure to measure performance against standards and despite the 
doubts of the critics for the past 13 years the signatory states 
have mustered the political will to keep on working and making 
progress let me say that it adds well it seems particularly 
appropriate to me that the final act is associated so closely with 
this city and this country 
more than any other diplomatic document the final act speaks to 
the yearning that finlands longtime president urno kekkonen 
spoke of more than a quarter century ago when he said in his words 
its the fervent hope of the finnish people that barriers be 
lowered all over europe and that progress be made along the road of 
european unity and he added that this was as he put it for 
the good of europe and thus of humanity as a whole 
well those were visionary words that vision inspired and 
shaped the drafting of the final act and continues to guide us 
today has the final act and what we call the helsinki process 
worked or not many say it hasnt but i believe it has 
in the security field i would point to the most recent fruit of 
the process the stockholm document of confidence and 
securitybuilding measures in europe this agreement lays down the 
rules by which our 35 states notify each other of upcoming military 
activities in europe provides detailed information on these 
activities in advance and lets the others know their plans for very 
large military activities one or two years in advance and agrees 
not to hold such maneuvers unless this notice is given invites 
observers to their larger military activities and permits onsite 
inspections to make sure the agreement is honored 
im happy to note that since our representatives shook hands to 
seal this agreement a year and a half ago all 35 states have by 
and large honored both the letter and the spirit of the stockholm 
document the western and neutral and nonaligned states have set 
strong example in providing full information about their military 
activities in april finland held its first military activity 
subject to the stockholm notification requirements and voluntarily 
invited observers to it 
the soviet union and its allies also have a generally good 
record of implementation though less forthcoming than the west 
ten onsite inspections have been conducted so far and more and 
more states are exercising their right to make such inspections i 
cant help but believe that making inspections a matter of routine 
business would improve openness and enhance confidence

sikh extremists killed nine people in 
the northern state of punjab today the government said it would 
cut a 100yard buffer zone around the golden temple to keep 
militants out of sikhisms holiest shrine 
on thursday president ramaswami venkataraman issued an 
ordinance making it illegal for temples and other religious sites 
to be used for political purposes it also would make harboring a 
wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine 
home minister buta singh whose ministry is responsible for 
internal security said today the government would clear houses and 
shops from around the golden temple complex in amritsar 
the actions were aimed at stemming the rising violence by sikh 
extremists who have been waging a guerrilla war in punjab since 
1982 for more political autonomy or an independent homeland 
the sikhs whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam say they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus 
the latest killings raised to more than 1180 the number of 
deaths blamed on sikh extremists in punjab since the start of the 
year in all of 1987 1030 people died 
the decision to cut a corridor around the walled shrine follows 
a 10day siege by police and paramilitary troops to drive sikh 
radicals from the temple 
the siege ended may 18 with the surrender of the last of 200 
sikh extremists and sympathizers from the complex at least 46 
people were killed in the confrontation most of them militants 
the police continue to keep a cordon around the shrine but 
their security efforts are hampered because dozens of shops houses 
and narrow alleys beside the complex provide cover for militants 
moving around in the area 
p chidambaram singhs deputy told the news conference that 
about 700 families and 300 shops would be displaced he said the 
government would set up a resettlement program for those forced to 
move

nor was stockholm the end of the process in vienna all 35 
signatory states are considering how to strengthen the confidence 
and securitybuilding measures in the context of a balanced outcome 
at the csce followup meeting that includes significant progress on 
human rights 
in the economic field as in the security field i believe there 
has been progress but of a different kind issues and negotiations 
regarding security are not simple but military technology makes 
arms and armies resemble each other enough so that common measures 
can be confidently applied economic relations by contrast are 
bedeviled by differences in our systems perhaps increases in 
nonstrategic trade can contribute to better relations between east 
and west 
but its difficult to relate the staterun economies of the east 
to the essentially free market economies of the west perhaps some 
of the changes underway in the staterun economies will equip them 
better to deal with our businessmen and open new arenas for 
cooperation but our work on these issues over the years has 
already made us understand that differences in systems are serious 
obstacles to expansion of economic ties and since understanding of 
unpleasant realities is part of wisdom that too is part of 
progress 
the changes taking place in the eastern countries of the 
continent go beyond changes in their economic systems and greater 
openness in their military activities changes have also begun to 
occur in the field of human rights as was called for in the final 
act the rest of us would like to see the changes that are being 
announced actually registered in the law and practice of our 
eastern partners and in the documents under negotiation in the 
vienna followup to the helsinki conference 
much has been said about the human rights and humanitarian 
provisions in the final act and the failure of the eastern bloc to 
honor them yet for all the bleak winds that have swept the plains 
of justice since that signing day in 1975 the accords have taken 
root in the conscience of humanity and grown in moral and 
increasingly in diplomatic authority i believe that this is no 
accident it reflects an increasing realization that the agenda of 
eastwest relations must be comprehensive that security and human 
rights must be advanced together or cannot truly be secured at all 
but it also shows that the provisions in the final act reflect 
standards that are truly universal in their scope the accords 
embody a fundamental truth a truth that gathers strength with each 
passing season and that will not be denied a truth that like the 
first finnish settlers in america all our ancient peoples find 
themselves today in a new world and that as those early settlers 
discovered the greatest creative and moral force in this new 
world the greatest hope for survival and success for peace and 
happiness is human freedom 
yes freedom the right to speak to print the right to 
worship to travel to assemble the belief the right to be 
different the right as the american philospher henry david thoreau 
wrote to step to the music of a different drummer this is 
freedom as most europeans and americans understand it and freedom 
as it is embodied in the universal declaration of human rights 
and yes in the helsinki accords 
and far more than the locomotive or the automobile the airplane 
or the rocket more than radio television or the computer this 
concept of liberty is the most distinct peculiar and powerful 
invention of the civilization we all share indeed without this 
freedom there would have been no mechanical inventions for 
inventions are eccentricities the men and women who create them 
are visionaries just like artists and writers they see what 
others fail to see and trust their insights when others dont 
the same freedom that permits literature and the arts to 
flourish the same freedom that allows one to attend church 
synagogue or mosque without apprehension that same freedom from 
oppression and supervision is the freedom that has given us the 
peoples of western europe and north america our dynamism our 
economic growth and out inventiveness together with japan and 
australia and many others we have lived in this state of freedom 
this house of democracy since the end of the second world war a 
house of democracy is a house whose doors are open to all because 
of it because of the liberty and popular rule weve shared today 
we also share a prosperity more widely distributed and extensive a 
political order more tolerant and humane than has ever before been 
known on earth 
to see not simply the immediate but the historic importance of 
this we should remember how far many of our nations have travelled 
and how desolate the future of freedom and democracy once seemed 
much of this century the totalitarian temptation in one form or 
another has beckoned to mankind also promising freedom but of a 
different kind than the one that we celebrate today this concept 
of liberty is as the czechoslovak writer milan kundera has put it 
the ageold dream of a world where everybody would live in 
harmony united by a single common will and faith without secrets 
from one another the freedom of imposed perfection 
fifty forty even as recently as thirty years ago the contest 
between this utopian concept of freedom on one hand and the 
democratic concept of freedom on the other seemed a close one 
promises of a perfect world lured many western thinkers and 
millions of others besides and many believed in the confident 
prediction of historys inevitable triump well few do today just 
as democratic freedom has proven itself incredibly fertile fertile 
not merely in a material sense but also in the abundance it has 
brought forth in the human spirit so too utopianism has proven 
brutal and barren 
albert camus once predicted that in his words when 
revolution in the name of power and of history becomes a murderous 
and immoderate mechanism a new rebellion is consecrated in the 
name of moderation of life isnt this exactly what we see 
happening across the mountains and plains of europe and even 
beyond the urals today 
in western europe support for utopian ideologies including 
support among intellectuals has all but collapsed while in the 
nondemocratic countries leaders grapple with the internal 
contradictions of their system and some ask how they can make that 
system better and more productive in a sense the front line in 
the competition of ideas that has played in europe and america for 
more than 70 years has shifted east once it was the democracies 
that doubted their own view of freedom and wondered whether utopian 
systems might not be better today the doubt is on the other side 
in just two days i will meet in moscow with general secretary 
gorbachev itll be our fourth set of facetoface talks since

ussoviet relations an agenda that is linked directly to the

seven tugboats this morning began 
hauling a drilling platform to its home off the louisiana coast 
where when erected it will stand higher than the worlds tallest 
building 
it looks smaller and smaller the farther away it gets pete 
arnold installation superintendent for the unwieldy engineering 
marvel said as the launch got under way my jobs just 
beginning 
the worlds tallest offshore drilling platform dubbed 
bullwinkle weighs 50000 tons and is 1365 feet long 
after its two drilling rigs are installed in the gulf of mexico 
it will weigh 78000 tons and stand 1615 feet high 161 feet 
higher than the worlds tallest building chicagos sears tower 
it is kind of a letdown when you finally see it go out 
gordon sterling project manager for shell offshore inc said 
thursday while overseeing lastminute preparations 
sterling has been in charge of bullwinkle during the three years 
it has taken to build the platform 
shell estimates the total cost of the bullwinkle project at 500 
million half of that is for building and installing the platform 
and preparing it for drilling while the remainder will go toward 
development drilling permanent production facilities and a 
pipeline to move the oil to shore the company said 
a steady stream of area residents stopped by the yard thursday 
night to take a final look at the huge drilling jacket which 
towers above the platforms 4acre base and is visible several 
miles away in corpus christi the jacket will hold the drilling 
rigs 
i came out to see it one last time said keith waddle of 
corpus christi as bullwinkle loomed in front of him 
workers expect to take about three days to pull the structure 
about 380 miles to its destination some 150 miles southwest of new 
orleans in the gulf of mexico installation will be completed in 
about three months 
twentyeight pilings for bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into 
the sea floor and secured with concrete bullwinkle is designed to 
withstand at least a 72foot hurricane wave with the ability to 
sway at least six feet without stress damage 
shell estimates that production will begin in the first quarter 
of 1989 and will peak at 50000 barrels of oil a day in 1991 and 
90 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in 1992 it has an 
estimated life span of 35 years according to the company 
the bullwinkle project was conceived when oil fetched well above 
20 a barrel sterling said but he added even today at 15 
its an economic profitable venture

yes we will also discuss economic issues although as in the 
helsinki process we have seen in recent years how much the 
differences in our systems inhibit expanded ties and how difficult 
it is to divorce economic relations from human rights and other 
elements of that relationship 
and yes as our countries did at helsinki we will take up 
other bilateral areas as well including scientific cultural and 
peopletopeople exchanges where weve been hard at work 
identifying new ways to cooperate in this area in particular i 
believe well see some good results before the week is over 
and like the final act our agenda now includes human rights as 
an integral component we have developed our dialogue and put in 
place new mechanisms for discussion 
the general secretary has spoken and forthrightly on the 
problems confronting the soviet union in his campaign to address 
these shortcomings he talks of glasnost and perestroika openness 
and restructuring words that to our ears have a particularly 
welcome sound and since he began his campaign things have 
happened that all of us applaud the list includes the release from 
labor camps or exile of people like andrei sakharov irina 
ratushnaskaya anatoly koryagin iosef begun and many other 
prisoners of conscience the publication of books like dr 
zhivago and children of the arbat the distribution of movies 
like repentance that are critical of aspects of the soviet past 
and present allowing higher levels of emigration greater 
toleration of dissent general secretary gorbachevs recent 
statements on religious toleration the beginning of soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
all this is new and good but at the same time there is another 
list defined not by us but by the standards of the helsinki final 
act and the sovereign choice of all participants including the 
soviet union to subscribe to it we need look no further through 
the final act to see where soviet practice does not or does not 
yet measure up to soviet commitment 
thirteen years after the final act was signed its difficult to 
understand why cases of divided families and blocked marriages 
should remain on the eastwest agenda or why soviet citizens who 
wish to exercise their right to emigrate should be subject to 
artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings 
and what are we to think of the continued suppression of those 
who wish to practice their religious beliefs over 300 men and 
women whom the world sees as political prisoners have been 
released there remains no reason why the soviet union cannot 
release all people still in jail for expression of political or 
religious belief or for organizing to monitor the helsinki act 
the soviets talk about a common european home and define it 
largely in terms of geography but what is it that cements the 
structure of clear purpose that all our nations pledge themselves 
to build by their signature of the final act what is it but the 
belief in alienable rights and dignity of every single human being 
what is it but a commitment to true pluralist democracy what is it 
but a dedication to the universally understood democratic concept 
of liberty that evolved from the genius of european civilization 
this body of values this is what marks or should mark the common 
european home 
mr gorbachev has spoken of in his words the artificiality 
and temporariness of the blocktoblock confrontation and the 
archaic nature of the iron curtain well i join him in this 
belief and welcome every sign that the soviets and their allies 
are ready not only to embrace but to put into practice the values 
that unify and indeed define contemporary western european 
civilization and its grateful american offspring 
some 30 years ago another period of relative openness the 
italian socialist pietro nenni long a friend of the soviet union 
warned that it was wrong to think that the relaxation could be 
permanent in as he said the absence of any system of judicial 
guarantees and he added that only democracy and liberty could 
prevent reversal of the progress under way 
there are a number of steps which if taken would help ensure 
the deepening and institutionalization of promise and reforms 
first the soviet leaders could agree to tear down the berlin wall 
and all barriers between eastern and western europe they could 
join us in making berlin itself an alleuropean center of 
communications meetings and travel they could also give legal and 
practical protection to free expression and worship 
let me interject here that at one time moscow was known as the 
city of the fortyforties because there were 1600 belfries in 
the churches of the city the world welcomed the return of some 
churches to worship after many years but there are still 
relatively few functioning churches and almost no bells 
mr gorbachev recently said as he put it believers are 
soviet people workers patriots and they have the full right to 
express their conviction with dignity while i applaud mr 
gorbachevs statement but a magnificent demonstration of good will 
it would be for the soviet leadership for church bells to ring out 
again not only in moscow but throughout the soviet union 
but beyond these particular steps there is a deeper question 
how can the countries of the east not only grant but guarantee the 
protection of rights the thought and practice of centuries has 
pointed out the way as the french constitutional philosopher 
montesquieu wrote more than two hundred years ago there is no 
liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the other 
powers of government and like the independence of the 
judiciary popular control over those who make the laws provides a 
vital practical guarantee of human rights so does the secret 
ballot so the freedom of citizens to associate and act for 
political purposes or for free collective bargaining 
i know that for the eastern countries such steps are difficult 
and some may say its unrealistic to call for them some said in 
1975 that the standards set forth in the final act were 
unrealistic that the comprehensive agenda it embodied was 
unrealistic some said earlier in this decade that calling for 
global elimination of an entire class of us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles was unrealistic but calling 
for 50 percent reductions in us and soviet strategic offensive arms 
was unrealistic that the soviets would never withdraw from 
afghanistan 
well is it realistic to pretend that rights are truly protected 
when there are no effective safeguards against arbitrary rule is 
it realistic when the soviet leadership itself is calling for 
glasnost and democratization to say that judicial guarantees or 
the independence of the judiciary or popular control over those 
who draft the laws or freedom to associate for political purposes 
are unrealistic 
and finally is it realisitic to say that peace is truly secure 
when political systems are less than open

we believe that realism is on our side when we say that peace 
and freedom can only be achieved together but that they can indeed 
be achieved together if were prepared to drive toward that goal 
so did the leaders who met in this room to sign the final act 
they were visionaries of the most practical kind 
in shaping our policy toward the soviet union in preparing for 
my meetings with the general secretary i have taken their vision 
a shared vision subscribed to by east west and the proud neutral 
and nonaligned countries of this continent as my guide i believe 
the standard that the framers of the final act set including the 
concept of liberty it embodies is a standard for all of us we can 
do no less than uphold it and try to see it turned as the soviets 
say into life itself 
we in the west will remain firm in our values strong and 
vigilent in defense of our interests ready to negotiate honestly 
for results of mutual and universal benefit one lesson we drew 
again from the events leading up to the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty was that in the world as it is today peace truly 
does depend on western strength and resolve it is a lesson we will 
continue to heed but were also prepared to work with the soviets 
and their allies whenever theyre ready to work with us 
by strength we do not mean a diktat that is an imposed 
settlement 
we mean confident negotiation 
the road ahead may be long but not as long as our countries had 
before them 44 years ago when finlands great president jk 
paasikivi told a nation that had shown the world uncommon courage 
in a harrowing time a path rises up from the slope from the 
floor of the valley at times the ascent is gradual at other times 
its steeper but all the time one comes closer and closer to free 
open spaces above which gods ever brighter sky can be seen the 
way up will be difficult but every step will take us closer to 
open vistas 
i believe that in moscow mr gorbachev and i can take another 
step toward a brighter future and a safer world and i believe that 
for the sake of all our ancient peoples this new world must be a 
place both of democratic freedom and of peace it must be a world 
in which the spirit of the helsinki final act guides all our 
countries like a great beacon of hope to all mankind for ages to 
come 
thank you and god bless you and bear with me now hyvaa 
menestysta svomen kansalle good luck to the finnish nation

an idaho income tax credit is being proposed 
to spur more people to go to the polls in the wake of the worst 
voter turnout for any statewide election 
i think its in the best interest of government said ada 
county clerk john bastida who came up with the idea for a 5 voter 
tax credit 
unofficial turnout in tuesdays primary was less than 25 percent 
of idahos 520000 registered voters initial checks showed turnout 
running about 22 percent in the larger counties and 15 percent in 
ada the states largest 
when 15 percent of the people are dictating to the other 85 
percent who their leaders are going to be i think thats bad 
bastida said there ought to be something gained from the people 
going to the polls instead of saying i dont care theyre all 
crooks anyway 
he said voters could be given a stamp when they cast their 
ballots and then place it on their state tax returns to show they 
qualified for the break 
i think the legislature ought to turn around and take a look 
at it bastida said

the rebel delegation to peace talks 
today accused the sandinista government of breaking a promise to 
allow them to meet with domestic opposition groups in the capital 
we came to managua because the sandinista government had 
offered us free movement and that we would meet with the opposition 
parties but that didnt occur last night said bosco matamoros 
spokesman for the nicaraguan resistance 
he said the rebel leaders had planned to meet thursday night 
with the nicaraguan democratic coordinate which groups political 
parties and other groups that oppose the sandinistas 
the sandinista government told us that they would come here 
and they told them that we would go there matamoros said so 
they were waiting for us there and we for them here and there 
wasnt a meeting were going to see if they the sandinistas 
fulfill that promise today 
despite the shaky start to the peace talks the two sides 
resumed talking this morning for the third round of toplevel 
discussions in managua to seek an end to the 6year war this 
round began on thursday 
the sandinistas on thursday rejected the contras offer to 
disarm if nicaragua embraces democracy 
the contras as the rebels are known demanded that the 
government guarantee complete press freedom within five days and 
abolish the military draft within 60 
they also demanded that the sandinistas ease their control over 
the army and government and allow the rebels to resupply their 
forces in the field 
manuel espinoza the presidential spokesman on thursday 
described the plan as preposterous 
the contra proposal is unrealistic and casts aside all that 
has been done and agreed upon until now and makes new proposals 
espinoza said 
with this proposal theyre acting as if they had won the war 
and the sandinistas had surrendered said deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco 
tinoco said the government offered to discuss guarantees in 
the electoral process dates for municipal elections reforms in 
the electoral law pluralistic representation in the electoral 
council and guarantees and norms for the functioning of a mixed 
economy 
alfredo cesar chief of the rebel delegation said the contra 
offer contained democratic changes the country should make at the 
end of the war 
cesar said the rebels were prepared to make a special effort 
to achieve a definitive ceasefire but he said the contra 
delegates were not optimistic about the outcome of the meeting and 
said the government has not complied with a preliminary peace plan 
agreed upon march 23 in sapoa 
at sapoa a nicaraguan town near the border with costa rica the 
two sides agreed to a 60day ceasefire and on the basis for 
further talks to arrange a permanent truce 
the ceasefire expires may 30 but president daniel ortega said 
this week he would extend it for an additional 30 days 
rebel leaders have said they want a permanent truce but will not 
break ortegas unilateral extension of the ceasefire 
under what the rebels called a flexible timetable they 
indicated they would lay down their arms sometime before christmas 
it seems they are trying to bypass the sapoa agreement said 
bayardo arce vice coordinator of the political commitee of the 
governing sandinista national liberation front 
in an interview arce said that defense minister gen humberto 
ortega head of the nicaraguan delegation told the contra 
delegates that the logical thing was to continue the discussions 
under the sapoa agreement 
the delegations are meeting under tight security at the camino 
real hotel contra representatives were permitted thursday to leave 
the hotel to visit relatives and political leaders

a navy officer and the marine enlisted man 
she married show that an officer and a gentleman can be a 
couple their attorney said after a general dismissed 
fraternization charges 
lt kathleen a mazure 29 was cleared after a 4hour hearing 
tuesday before maj gen gene deegan commander of the marine air 
ground combat center at twentynine palms 
the case was about whether the love of country by a member 
of the military could somehow automatically and in all 
circumstances preclude the love of another also a member of the 
military said mark rosenbaum an attorney for the american civil 
liberties union foundation of southern california 
ms mazure and her husband scott price 24 who resigned from 
the marines showed that an officer and a gentleman could be a 
couple and that there was something sick and cockeyed about 
declaring for all members of the military even for members of 
different branches that love at first sight or anytime thereafter 
was always to be a crime rosenbaum said thursday 
price of eden texas married ms mazure on nov 28 
charges were brought nov 25 marking the first time in the 
history of the united states that charges of fraternization 
have been brought against an officer for conduct with a member of 
another branch of the service rosenbaum said emphasizing that 
the couple were not in the same chain of command 
the charges had been recommended for courtmartial but on 
tuesday deegan held a hearing that resulted in dismissal of the 
allegation the attorney said 
i love my husband i love the navy and i dont see why the 
two are not compatible said ms mazure a dentist assigned to 
twentynine palms i hope that from out of this the fraternization 
policy will become more defined 
ms mazure said that she was stationed in jacksonville fla 
when she met price during an evening of dancing in 1986 and that 
neither knew the other was in the service until after several dates 
they kept in touch by mail when price was transferred to the 
california desert base in 1987

a judge has decided a 67yearold man 
paralyzed in the crossfire of a crack cocaine shootout cant 
testify in the case because his appearance could prejudice the jury 
his speech therapist says he wants to testify and ive 
been over and talked to him and he indicated to me he wants to 
testify i cant believe we cant put the victim on the stand 
said deputy district attorney michael gaffey 
alameda county superior court judge david lee ruled wednesday 
after a hearing at the hospital bedside of terry brown who is 
paralyzed from the neck down and breathes with the help of a 
respirator 
browns appearance could jeopardize the defendants right to a 
fair trial lee said 
the man was an innocent victim who stepped out of his house 
and was shot he doesnt remember anything said ray plumhoff 
an assistant public defender in the assault trial of nate porter 
20 and johnny lee smith 19 
porter and smith are charged with assault in the june 30 1987 
gunfight in which at least five men battled in the street outside 
browns home 
the only reason te prosecutor wanted to bring mr brown in 
was to prejudice the jury by showing how badly injured he was 
brown was shot in the neck with an uzi carbine as porters gang

george bush claiming the bracing 
maine air had invigorated him to step up his battle against 
democrat michael dukakis declared today im the underdog and i 
like it 
he is the frontrunner hes been decreed that by poll after 
poll bush told reporters in a news conference on the lawn of his 
oceanside retreat 
do i worry about it i dont worry about it i like fighting 
back bush said brushing off recent polls suggesting dukakis 
lead has been widening 
he called for a resumption of collpased negotiations to remove 
panamanian gen manuel noriega from power though he had previously 
expressed reservations about the talks he said the talks should 
also include other nations if possible 
bush branded as an outrageous lie what he said was a 
reported suggestion by noriega that the negotiations were meant to 
help bushs campaign 
when you read these outrageous charges by a drugrelated 
indicted dictator discount them they are total lies he said 
bush with the pounding surf of the atlantic to his back also 
said if elected he would personnally countermand any effort by the 
secret service to close off the nearby waters to lobstermen as a 
security precaution 
that is absolutely absurd he said they will continue to 
fish here and they will continue to be welcome 
as a sole lobster boat worked its pots in a cove several hundred 
yards away bush said he would give up coming to his maine retreat 
rather than see the waters closed 
bush is here for a week of talks with advisers and prominent 
republicans among todays visitors were govs john mckernan of 
maine john sununu of new hampshire and james thompson of illinois 
as well as former housing secretary carla hills and former deputy 
treasury secretary richard darman 
of the recent polls bush said things arent in focus yet it 
is may the election is in november 
a washington postabc poll today reported that dukakis had a 
13point lead over bush and that among female voters the 
massachusetts governor was ahead by a 6030 margin 
bush conceded that the gender gap was a major concern he 
said it was at the top of todays discussion list in fact 
what ive got to do is more clearly define what i feel on 
certain womens issues one of them will be day care 
bush promised to come out of his oneweek break swinging 
when i get up here i feel its not feistiness but i feel 
very relaxed about it i dont feel troubled by somebody pointing 
out im behind in the polls im coming out of 10 points down 
in these polls and ive got five months to fight back 
theres a little bit of a cholesterol rise the frustration 
level going up in terms of sitting around and listening to jesse 
jackson and michael dukakis dump all over me and the the 
administration so im beginning to get a little more combative 
bush said 
one day earlier bush pollster robert teeter conceded that 
bushs gender gap seemed to be far worse than that ever faced 
by president reagan who also had more support among men than women 
voters 
its largely for institutional reasons its got more to do 
with party than it does with candidates but it did close in 1984 
as we got close to the election although it never closed 
completely there is an institutional and a party gender gap and 
were going to make a very strong effort to close it teeter said 
bush staff chief craig fuller said that the vice president would 
focus on domestic affairs in sessions on friday and saturday and 
would meet with economic advisers next tuesday and wednesday to 
flesh out his fall campaign positions 
fuller said that bush was not overly concerned about recent 
polls that showed him falling behind dukakis 
there are some advantages to being the underdog and fighting 
back fuller said 
campaigning in new jersey on thursday bush focused on the war 
against drugs calling for a requirement that government contracts 
be awarded only to companies that have drug free programs for 
their employes 
aides said that the proposal could involve some form of 
mandatory drug testing for all companies doing busines with the 
government although details had not been worked out 
bush also called for an international drug strike force that 
would seek out and destroy drug crops wherever they were found 
and he said he would put a single military figure in charge 
of coordinating us participation in such an effort bush has said 
that the overall antidrug effort in his administration would be 
headed by the vice president

republican george bush said today he is unperturbed by polls 
that give likely democratic nominee michael dukakis a doubledigit 
lead adding that i like fighting back the massachusetts 
governor for his part scoffed at bushs drug proposals and asked 
why havent these been done in the past seven years 
dukakis and jesse jackson made quick stops in new mexico one of 
four states that will hold endoftheseason primaries on june 7 
while bush settled in for a week of strategy sessions at his summer 
home in maine 
i dont feel troubled out by somebody pointing out im behind 
in the polls bush told reporters im coming out 10 points 
down in these polls and ive got five months to fight back 
i like that position he added noting that he lost iowas 
firstinthenations caucuses in february but came back to clinch 
the republican nomination handily 
jackson meanwhile was wrapping up a 10day stay in the west 
today jackson has been campaigning hard in california but polls 
suggest he is running well behind dukakis in the state with its 
big primary only 11 days away 
there are 314 delegates are at stake in the california contest 
and primaries the same day in new jersey montana and new mexico 
offer another 162 delegates dukakis hopes to clinch the democratic 
nomination in that round of races 
jackson who has been focusing less on his slim chance of 
winning the nomination and more on his efforts to influence the 
democratic platform claimed credit on thursday for bringing the 
frontrunning dukakis closer to his point of view on some issues 
he is adjusting to a new agenda jackson told a rally in san 
jose calif dukakis aides though say the governor is listening 
to what jackson has to say but not making any major changes in his 
positions 
were not going to negotiate our basic stands dukakis 
spokesman leslie dach said thursday youre not going to see any 
kind of fundamental shifts 
dukakis himself rarely makes mention of jackson these days he 
reserves his disdain almost exclusively for the reagan 
administration particularly bush who already has enough delegates 
for the gop nomination 
the massachusetts governor was campaigning in palo alto calif 
on thursday hours after bush called for the creation of an 
international antidrug strike force a drug summit and the denial 
of government contracts to companies lacking antidrug programs 
the vice presidents proposals described by aides as a major 
antidrug initiative came in a speech before he visited a 
drugrehabilitation center in newark nj 
dukakis said that he wasnt impressed with the recommendations 
the question is why havent these been done in the past seven 
years isnt the vice president in charge of this effort he 
asked referring to bushs position as head of an antidrug task 
force 
bush arrived thursday night at his vacation home in 
kennebunkport maine where he intends to spend a week conferring 
with aides and republican leaders one topic certain to be 
discussed is a string of recent polls indicating bush is running 
behind dukakis 
the latest such survey by abc news and the washington post 
gave dukakis a 13point advantage according to the poll published 
in todays editions of the post dukakis leads bush 53 percent to 
40 percent 
the survey also suggested that bush is viewed unfavorably by 
nearly four times as many people as dukakis is by 37 percent 
compared with 10 percent in dukakis case 
the postabc survey also said that when voters were asked about 
problems facing the country bush scored better on national 
defense but he trailed dukakis on a dozen other issues including 
the fight against drugs 
the survey based on telephone interviews with 1172 adults 
between may 19 to may 26 had a margin of error of plus orminus 3 
percentage points the newspaper said 
the vice presidents pollster robert teeter said thursday that 
the bush campaign was concerned about the recent polls but said 
findings in may dont necessarily point to trouble in november 
youd rather be ahead but there surely is no feeling of 
crisis or panic teeter said were a long way ahead of the 
election 
meanwhile both democrats continued to hammer away at what is 
becoming a familiar campaign theme the administrations dealings 
with panamas military leader manuel antonio noriega 
jackson pointed to the disgraceful practice of negotiating 
with drug dealers which discredits our government and is beneath 
our dignity 
and dukakis said im going to continue to insist on a full 
explanation from the administration about whats going on with 
noriega 
are there links with the cia who were the people that were 
involved in drugrunning and profitskimming and who was it in 
this administration who thought that made sense he asked 
the reagan administration has been trying for months to induce 
noriega to relinquish his post the general is under us 
indictment on drugtrafficking charges which the administration 
had offered to drop to get him out of power 
dukakis meanwhile was facing a problem at home that 
republicans hope will prove an embarrassment a 110 million tax 
increase that is headed for his desk dukakis makes frequent 
reference when campaigning to his reputation as a taxcutting 
governor 
the tax package includes 70 million to tie the state income tax 
to the federal code and 40 million from a cigarette tax and is 
aimed at helping alleviate budget problems however the governor 
has insisted that the state budget can be balanced without the tax 
proposal

in five weeks iraq has dramatically 
turned the tables on iran with two major battlefield victories that 
have aggravated tehrans military and political troubles 
the military defeats have badly jolted iran which was already 
beset by economic woes a political power struggle between radicals 
and conservatives and growing international isolation 
theres a lot of confusion in tehran now said a western 
diplomatic source with contacts in the iranian capital but the 
iranians will not take this lying down theyll retaliate 
they may be on the ropes but theyre not on their knees 
yet said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the unexpectedly aggressive tactics of the iraqis who for the 
last six years have been content to fight a static war behind their 
formidable defense lines appeared to catch the iranians 
flatfooted twice in just over a month 
the iraqi 3rd army corps spearheaded by brigades of the elite 
presidential guard drove the iranians out of marshlands east of 
iraqs southern port city of basra on wednesday the 7th corps 
again led by presidential guard units recaptured the faw peninsula 
south of basra in a 34hour assault that ended april 18 
for iran the loss of that territory was a major psychological 
and political blow iraq took back the most significant gains iran 
had to show for 7 years of war 
iraq also stole iranian bargaining chips in any future peace 
talks in the persian gulf war 
moreover tehran was suffering other military setbacks the same 
day the faw battle ended the us navy sank one of irans missile 
frigates and a missileattack craft and disabled another frigate 
after destroying two of irans offshore oil platforms 
the battles seriously damaged irans naval power tehran sought 
to save face by staging big naval maneuvers 
but western sources said although iran boasted that 55 vessels 
took part in the maneuvers only five modern warships and an aging 
destroyer were assembled with small craft 
theyre clearly in no shape to take on the americans again 
but the revolutionary guards in their armed speedboats remain a 
menace said a european naval specialist who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
however it may well be too soon to consider these defeats a 
turning point in the seemingly interminable gulf war 
the iraqis are clearly determined to reclaim their 
territory said hansheino kopietz an analyst with the 
londonbased international institute for strategic studies but 
they dont seem to be interested in going across the border into 
iran again he said in a telephone interview 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after weeks of border 
skirmishes the iranians initially were overwhelmed but drove the 
iraqis back across the frontier by 1982 
afterward the iranians held the initiative in the ground war 
until last month 
the sudden change in iraqi strategy may stem from baghdads 
frustration with the failure of the u n security council to 
impose sanctions on iran for not heeding a un ceasefire 
resolution passed in july 
iran has resisted international pressure to talk about peace 
despite its growing economic turmoil iraqi air raids on irans oil 
industry its economic lifeline have taken their toll iran is now 
importing unprecedented amounts of refined products like kerosene 
and jet fuel 
moreover the slump in the value of the dollar to which oil 
prices are pegged has cut revenues that tehran needs to pay for 
its war effort 
up to half of tehrans 6 million people fled to the countryside 
to escape iraqi missiles that blasted a path of destruction across 
the city from feb 29 to april 21 
there are signs that tehrans ability to wage war has been hurt 
the iranians failed to launch an expected major offensive during 
the winter when bad weather favors iran by neutralizing iraqs 
superior air power and armor 
it was the first time in six years the iranians failed to launch 
a major winter push

a un official said friday that continuing 
warfare in afghanistan could delay the return of more than 5 
million war refugees 
prince sadruddin aga khan the united nations relief 
coordinator for afghanistan said he could not predict how many of 
the refugees plan to return most are in iran and pakistan 
its common sense that people do not feel very encouraged to 
go home if they know there is still fighting sadruddin told 
reporters 
but the one incentive which will encourage them to go home as 
quickly as possible is that they love their country and feel very 
homesick he said 
he said respecting last months geneva accords which call for 
the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan and the safe and 
voluntary return of refugees was paramount for peace 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in 1979 to help the afghan 
government fight a civil war with anticommunist guerrillas and 
they began pulling out of the country may 15 the guerrillas have 
said they will continue fighting until the afghan government falls 
sadruddin left geneva on friday for pakistan afghanistan and 
iran where he will talk with government leaders and refugee 
experts on the relief and repatriation effort 
it is his first trip to the region since un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar named him to oversee the refugee return 
perez de cuellar will appeal in june for funds to launch the 
program said sadruddin a former un high commissioner for 
refugees 
but if the conflict continues it will be difficult to put the 
structures into place sadruddin said land mines littering the 
countryside after 10 years of civil war must be removed before 
anyone can go back he said 
an internal un document compiled last month predicted it would 
cost about 130 million for 1 million refugees to return and 324 
million for the return of 3 million refugees 
about 24 million afghans live in iran and another 31 million 
live in pakistan according to un figures

president reagan in his first visit to the soviet 
capital will see an enormous city of 12lane boulevards dominated 
in part by seven massive stalinera baroque buildings he will see 
the city at its best the lilacs are blooming the weather is mild 
and downtown stores are stocked with meat and tomatoes 
arriving for the first time in the soviet capital is at times 
like taking a trip back in time the electrical appliances seem 
oldfashioned and traffic jams are rare though smog has taken hold 
nearly 9 million people live here yet the only time it seems 
crowded is when people are queuing to buy food perfume and other 
scarce consumer goods humans are dwarfed by immense buildings 
both the charmless modern structures from the 1960s said to be 
modeled on buildings nikita khrushchev saw and liked in new york 
city and a variety of monuments to mother russias war heroes 
few of the cars are new almost all are sovietmade and 
taxicabs seem scarce at least to the legion of visitors who 
arrived this week to prepare for the reagangorbachev summit 
most muscovites do not own cars and so while central committee 
and politburo members are whisked into the kremlin during the 
morning rush hour and out again at dusk millions of commuters use 
the citys excellent subway or local bus and trolley systems 
the kremlin is not one big building like the pentagon for 
example instead it is a walled citadel of government buildings 
cathedrals towers and arsenals dating back to the 14th century 
alcatraz on the outside versailles on the inside in the words 
of one american 
some of the citys best known sites the redandwhite and 
yellowandblue onion domes of st basils cathedral cobblestoned 
red square and the bolshoi theater sit just outside the kremlins 
redbrick wall 
the words grim drab dreary and unkempt are 
often used to describe moscow but the sunny skies the first in 
10 months the sweetsmelling purple lilacs and the presummit 
spruceup helps overcome the feeling of grayness brought on in 
large part by decades of listless architecture 
its not paris but its a lot prettier that it was two months 
ago said richard gilbert an american embassy spokesman 
soldiers in their gray tunics and green hats are shining the 
huge swinging metal doors on government buildings 
women on hands and knees are planting begonias in front of the 
kremlin wall workers are mowing the grass sprinkled with yellow 
dandelions and plasterers are touching up the union of writers 
club where reagan will visit a threeman team is painting the 
flagpoles of the pushkin museum 
residents seem excited about the upcoming reagan visit 
at the hotel rossiya home to many of the american journalists 
and officials working at the summit the local employees not 
widely known for wasting pleasantries are going out of their way 
to be helpful 
the dezhurni russian key ladies who are posted day and 
night on each hotel floor smile when you turn in the key after 
leaving the room service may be slow but this week at least it is 
service with a smile 
service is impossible here said george black a businessman 
from basking ridge nj who has dealt with the soviets in his 
advertising business theres no motivation thats the 
problem he said 
black and his wife ruth say they have deep affection for the 
soviet people when you get to know them they are very nice 
he said for americans the language barrier is a real problem he 
said because the soviets may seem rude when they are really just 
embarrassed at not being able to communicate 
while soviet bureaucrats and law enforcement officials generally 
wear a dour expression young people were smiling as they strolled 
in the may sunshine along the broad sidewalks of kalinin prospekt 
moscows fifth avenue where behind the glass shop windows are 
a paltry number of fashions and consumer products 
moscow has little street crime no doubt partly a result of the 
omnipresence of police there are so many uniformed officers that 
they sometimes seem to be watching one another 
the moscow militia says none of moscows 60 banks has been 
robbed in 20 years 
the hotels have plenty of food on hand for the summit 
attracting large numbers of soviets who filled their bellies and 
in some cases their pockets with such rarities as tomatoes 
sausages and cheese items that the locals say have not been seen 
for weeks in most stores 
the beriozkas special hotel shops which accept only western 
currency are freshly stocked for the summit and foreign residents 
of the city have been seen carting cases of wine to their waiting 
cars a basic precaution in a society where such commodities may 
not reappear for months 
renee fisher a teacher from tampa fla said her biggest 
disappointment on her trip to the soviet union is that the 
facilities are dirty and unhygienic but that hardly affected 
her trip she said 
the people are so nice and they love americans she said

a medical examiner under investigation 
for supplementing his income selling bones from the dead for up to 
425 a body had the approval of his superiors the countys chief 
administrator says 
unless we are given some new information that it legally 
should not continue then it will said tom vickers head of the 
bexar county commission 
county chief medical examiner dr vincent dimaio said thursday 
he earned about 50000 since 1983 removing bones for the 
nonprofit bone bank foundation of san antonio which used them in 
transplants 
prosecutors are examining whether he violated the law in 
removing the bones in county facilities or on county time said 
assistant district attorney nelson skip atwell 
we will talk to him and the county auditor and then well sit 
down and evaluate the thing and see if its a commissioners court 
issue or something we should be involved in or something nobody 
should be involved in atwell said 
dimaio who was among several pathologists who exhumed lee 
harvey oswalds body in dallas for reexamination in 1981 said he 
has charged between 175 and 425 per body for removing bones from 
corpses sent to the medical examiners office 
a gunshot wound expert who also supplements his 92000ayear 
salary by testifying at civil and criminal trials dimaio said that 
he had county approval and that consent forms were obtained from 
survivors 
i charged for my time on my own time not on the countys 
time he said they may be able to change their minds but they 
cant ever say they werent informed 
vickers said that the county commissioners in 1983 agreed to let 
dimaio do work for the bone bank foundation and decided the county 
would bill the foundation 25 per case for use of the facilities 
vickers said 
it was all above board vickers said as far as i can 
tell he didnt try to hide anything his statement was given in 
open court in front of attorneys and auditors 
dimaio likened his role to a physician removing a heart from an 
accident victim for use in another transplant everyone is paid 
for their services he said 
at the foundation the bones are cleaned and chopped into pieces 
and freezedried for use in transplants mostly for back dental or 
reconstructive surgery

democratic presidential contender jesse 
jackson told indian leaders today that indians have been ignored by

american indian leadership 
jackson spoke to the indian group at the all indian pueblo 
council today one day after telling a separate audience that the 
american public deserves a fullscale congressional investigation 
of us dealings with panamanian gen manuel noriega 
the us government should not negotiate with drug dealers 
jackson said thursday 
vice president george bush and president reagan have been plea 
bargaining with noriega jackson said 
we need and deserve a fullscale congressional 
investigation he said so far weve heard one side of the 
story theyve been trying to smoke him out buy him out the 
deal being noriegas silence 
he told the indians today that they should not surrender their 
values 
jackson hearkened back to the beginning of his rainbow coalition 
and called for people to work together 
hispanics in the barrios blacks in the ghettos ranchers on 
ranches indians on reservations theres a tendency of these 
people to be abandoned by law he said the real challenge is 
to begin to pull together our various backgrounds and find common 
ground to turn to each other and not on each other 
on thursday jackson spoke to the national federation of 
democratic women as the group opened its annual convention here 
and he lamented what he said were inequities women face in society 
half our nation is female half of our poor children live in a 
house run by poor women where there is no man he said women 
make 65 cents on a dollar to what a man makes 
your selfrespect is not negotiable he said youve 
earned the right to expect era the equal rights amendment to be 
in the democratic party platform 
dukakis was to speak to the womens group later today 
jackson also talked of the governments need to stop the flow of 
drugs into the united states 
drugs affect our family drugs affect our children in schools 
drugs affect the safety of our streets he said drugs are the 
no 1 threat to our national security 
jackson in the final weeks of campaigning for his partys 
nomination made several campaign appearances in california earlier 
in the day 
the obviously tired and hoarse candidate also criticized a small 
movement in the united states that wants to make english the 
official language of the country in a reference to the upcoming 
summit between reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
reagan is going to meet with gorbachev this week in moscow 
he said its the right thing to do its a step in the right 
direction i hope our translator does not speak english only 
jacksons visit to new mexico was the second this month 
polls indicate jackson is running far behind massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for the june 7 primary 
dukakis has 1700 delegates for the nomination while jackson 
has 983 according to the associated press another 443 delegates 
still are uncommitted and a candidate needs at least 2081 to win 
the nomination 
new mexico will have 28 delegates to the democratic national 
convention in atlanta this summer

hoping to buy time for victims of one of the 
bleakest forms of cancer a west german surgeon is repairing livers 
outside the body a procedure believed to be the first of its kind 
i think it may help some patients for whom we couldnt do 
anything else said dr rudolf pichlmayr of the university of 
hannover medical school 
pichlmayr said that he has removed repaired and replaced livers 
three times including twice this month malignant liver tumors 
left no choice he said the repairs took four to five hours 
the patients two women and a man were doing well pichlmayr 
said thursday by telephone from west germany 
they are improved dramatically he said im afraid those 
patients might get a reoccurrence of the disease but i feel the 
justification to do it because its the best possible retaliation 
against cancer 
he said that because of the nature of liver cancer the patients 
would probably eventually develop new tumors either in the liver 
or elsewhere but the operation at least will prolong their lives 
previously such bench surgery was limited to the 
wellestablished repair of blood vessels or the removal of cysts 
and tumors in kidneys which are less delicate and less vital to 
sustaining life than the liver 
its a very intriguing development said liver transplant 
pioneer dr thomas starzl of the university of pittsburgh 
i can see how it might be a significant advance although we 
really must wait and see he said 
my hats off to him its a monumental effort said liver 
transplant surgeon dr john s najarian of the university of 
minnesota he has tried liver transplants on four liver cancer 
patients only one of whom is still alive 
liver cancer is among the deadlier forms of the disease said 
national cancer institute spokesman frank mahaney early detection 
gives patients a 10 percent to 30 percent chance of surviving for 
five years late detection leaves a mere 3 percent chance 
pichlmayr performed the first operation feb 5 to remove cancer 
that more than doubled the weight of a 40yearold womans liver 
the woman has since returned home 
he said a transplant might have wasted a valuable donor organ 
because the cancer had spread beyond her liver and he avoided 
traditional inbody repairs because of the tumors size and central 
location 
as he removed the organ pichlmayr installed a pump that kept 
blood flowing through the two main explosed blood vessels outside 
the body the liver was cooled with ice water and flushed 
periodically with a special fluid to keep it fresh 
pichlmayr described the procedure in a west german medical 
journal in april 
shes gained weight again and at this moment shes very 
healthy he said she was suffering extremely and i think she 
would not be alive now 
pichlmayr performed liver bench surgery again may 6 on a 
48yearold woman and may 11 on a 58yearold man 
the lady is at home quite well he said the man is still 
in the hospital but is good 
also this year pichlmayr did the worlds first splitliver 
transplant dividing one liver and implanting the halves into two 
patients

investigators said they caught up with eiland as hes now known 
by police after eight months when they jailed a man named joe

sikh terrorists killed seven people 
friday in punjab state and two people died of injuries suffered in 
an earlier bomb blast the government announced plans to shut off 
the golden temple to militant sikhs 
home minister buta singh whose ministry is responsible for 
internal security told reporters the government would carve out a 
100yard corridor around the temple complex to try to keep 
extremists from using the shrine as a hideout 
the office of president ramaswami venkataraman announced that 
indias 30yearold arms act had been amended to provide stringent 
punishment for the use of outlawed firearms 
under the amendment a person convicted of possessing prohibited 
arms such as rocket launchers could be sentenced to life in prison 
the government says sikh extremists are bringing these more 
sophisticated arms in from pakistan 
previously the maximum sentence was three years in prison 
the moves came one day after the president issued an ordinance 
making it illegal for temples and other religious sites to be used 
for political purposes the ordinance also would make harboring a 
wanted criminal in a shrine punishable by imprisonment or a fine 
two of the people who died friday were hindu laborers injured 
thursday when a bomb went off in a crowded market in the town of 
phagwara in kapurthala district east of amritsar 
the bombing was blamed on the barbar kalsa gang one of a dozen 
sikh extremist groups operating in punjab 
it was the latest in a series of attacks on migrant workers 
police believe the extremists are trying to drive hindu laborers 
out of the state and undercut its agricultural economy 
seven other deaths were reported friday including a sikh father 
and son shot to death by sikh gunmen in amritsar district the 
united news of india reported there were no details on the other 
slayings 
the latest killings raised to more than 1180 the number of 
deaths blamed on sikh extremists in punjab since the start of the 
year in all of 1987 1030 people died 
most victims of sikh violence have been hindus but moderate 
sikhs are also targeted by the militants who have been fighting 
since 1982 for a separate nation in punjab 
singh said houses and shops around the golden temple sikhisms 
holiest shrine would be razed to make way for the security 
corridor he said construction would begin soon but he didnt give 
a date 
p chidambaram singhs deputy said about 700 families and 300 
shops would be displaced but that the government would set up a 
resettlement program for those forced to move 
the decision to build the corridor follows a 10day siege by 
police and paramilitary troops to drive sikh radicals from the 
temple the standoff ended may 18 when the last of about 200 sikh 
extremists and sympathizers inside the temple surrendered 
at least 46 people were killed in the confrontation most of 
them militants 
police still patrol around the shrine but security efforts are 
hampered because scores of shops houses and narrow alleys abutting 
the complex provide cover for militants moving around the area 
singh a sikh himself was asked if there was a political 
solution to the situation he responded do you think these 
terrorists have any political aims other than their declared goal 
of khalistan if that is the thing then we dont have a political 
solution 
khalistan is the name that sikhs envision for their nation 
sikhs are a religious minority in india and claim they are 
discriminated against by the majority hindus they form the 
majority in punjab state

theres no free lunch at uncle bobs 
diner in fact theres no lunch at all no sunny side up no 
french fries with gravy no coffee 
the only food on jerry bertas menu nourishes the soul 
all thats cooking in the kitchen of what is now the diner 
store are other diners only smaller 
berta a 37yearold sculptor has been creating ceramic diners 
for 12 years from artdeco saltandpepper shakers to diners 
eight inches high and 15 inches long with working neon signs 
the dinerwithinadiner has fascinated berta for years but the 
chance to set up his gallery in uncle bobs diner believed to be 
michigans last remaining diner when it closed 15 years ago was 
more than he had hoped for 
people all over knew about uncle bobs berta said thursday 
i had a guy from madison wis write to me saying hed spent 
every night for four years in the 50s at this place 
berta came across the 41yearold abandoned diner in flint in 
1986 bought it for 2000 and had mobile home transporters move it 
125 miles to the tiny town of rockford north of grand rapids 
where hes lived with his artistwife for 15 years 
he has spent the last year working on the 53by32foot eatery 
to restore its original pink formica ceilings porcelain enamel 
exterior and stainless steel sunburst patterns 
it looks just the same as in 1947 when it was built berta 
says swiveling on one of the diners original stools 
while the gallery doesnt open for business until june 15 the 
opening reception is friday all told the project has cost him 
about 50000 
it sounds real crazy but its going to be great making diners 
in a diner says berta sporting a tuxedo with brightred bowtie 
and hightop sneakers to match 
lots of times people are intimidated when they walk into a 
gallery he says people are going to feel real comfortable 
when they walk in here 
the kitchen will be his studio and the counters and shelves 
where miniature boxes of cereal undoubtedly sat years ago will be 
the showplace for his art which ranges from 60 to about 1000 
inside some of the diners are tiny cocacola signs and ceramic 
utensils and food on counter tops 
berta said he became intrigued with creating his own 
interpretations of the nearly extinct eateries after designing tiny 
ceramic rooms 
i did a diner one day and it was my favorite so i just kept 
going he says 
berta and his wife madeline kaczmarczyk who creates ceramic 
teapot sculptures and also will exhibit her work at the gallery do 
the majority of their business at art fairs and exhibits across the 
country 
and while they dont know how strong business will be in this 
relatively conservative region in southwest michigan the two 
detroit natives hope to draw potential customers from as far away 
as their hometown and chicago

president najib chose a new prime 
minister from outside his governing party in an effort to widen his 
support base as soviet troops withdraw leaving the government to 
face moslem guerrillas alone 
however the presidents choice 62yearold mohammad hasan 
sharq has been closely associated with the party he has been a 
deputy prime minister in najibs government for the past 11 months 
his promotion announced late thursday by official kabul radio 
must be approved by the national assembly which is expected to 
convene in a few days confirmation is virtually certain because 
the body is controlled by najibs peoples democratic party and 
allied groups 
sharq was entrusted with primary responsibility for repatriating 
an estimated 5 million refugees onethird of the countrys 
population who have fled since soviet troops entered afghanistan 
in 1979 to help the government in its war with the guerrillas 
he would replace prime minister sultan ali keshtmand a ranking 
member of the governing party since its founding in 1965 
keshtmand 52 was appointed to the post in 1981 by najibs 
predecessor babrak karmal keshtmand was named secretary of the 
central committee of the governing party 
najib has repeatedly professed a desire to bring more nonparty 
men into his government as moscow withdraws its troop 
however the test of whether such a declaration will have real 
basis or be primarily cosmetic may come when sharqs cabinet is 
named 
if they simply move to reshuffle the furniture its not going 
to be significant a western diplomat said friday 
most of the current 34 cabinet members are either members of the 
party or closely tied to it the exact breakdown is unknown because 
of the shadowy nature of afghan politics 
najibs declarations of plans to broaden his government has not 
ended guerrilla attacks 
from their bases in pakistan the guerrillas have announced they 
captured at least a dozen afghan army border posts since april 15 
when the soviet union agreed to start pulling out its troops 
under the withdrawal agreement the more than 10000 kremlin 
soldiers in afghanistan are to leave by next february moscow says 
9000 already have crossed the amu darya river into the soviet 
union since the withdrawal began may 15 
najibs choice of sharq as prime minister also appeared to 
lessen the chances of former king zahir shah returning to kabul to 
preside over any transition from the present sovietstyle socialist 
government to a more broadlybased government 
the restoration of the king in a role ranging from figurehead 
to active player has been a topic of speculation in both eastern 
and western diplomatic circles since the kremlin decided to end its 
military intervention 
sharq was cabinet chief of staff when mohammad daoud a cousin 
of the former king served as prime minister from 1953 to 1963 
however during that decade the king exercised little power 
daoud resigned in 1963 at zahir shahs behest and then overthrew 
him in 1973

an exconvict tricked a lawyer into sending 
him a resume then assumed the attorneys identity collecting 
thousands of dollars in legal fees and defending a man in court 
before disappearing authorities said 
james klaver was out of prison awaiting retrial in a rape case 
when he began impersonating richard keffler a reallife lawyer in 
texas who also practices in florida seminole county authorities 
said 
klaver had all the credentials of a lawyer including an id card 
from the florida bar and numerous law books 
he collected more than 3000 in retainer fees from clients and 
appeared before orange county circuit judge ted coleman on april 
18 representing a drug user 
coleman said wednesday he had been suspicious about klaver but 
didnt say anything at the time 
i thought he was the defendant said the judge i guess to 
judges lawyers are like pornography we dont know what it is 
but we know it when we see it 
the case eventually was reassigned to a real lawyer with the 
client pleading guilty to cocaine possession 
investigators said klaver who was released from prison in 
december when his conviction and 60year rape sentence were 
overturned had called keffler in march 
keffler said klaver claimed to be a business owner planning to 
expand into texas he said the man wanted him to handle the firms 
legal matters keffler sent klaver his resume 
within weeks klaver was pretending to be keffler police said 
seminole county sheriffs sgt jerry human and deputy robin 
yolton said klaver moved into an office also used by attorney 
angela blakeley after telling her he was being placed on a list of 
lawyers available for courtappointed work 
klaver began taking cases and accepting fees 
he appeared legitimate said ms blakeley all his 
references checked out 
officials discovered the ruse after a man charged with writing 
bad checks complained that his lawyer had abandoned him after 
collecting a 200 retainer 
investigators have asked the state attorneys office to file 
charges of forgery obtaining property by false impersonation and 
theft against klaver 
a spokesman for the florida bar jerry butterfield said the bar 
may have to tighten controls on its id cards possibly adding 
photographs 
ms blakeley said that when klaver disappeared he took more 
than 10000 in law books and computer equipment including all her 
business records and collected about 10000 from her own clients 
he fled in a car he bought under the name and credit rating of 
keffler authorities said

five old trucks and buses driven by us 
veterans left the capital friday as part of the nationwide 
veterans peace convoy bearing food medical supplies clothing 
and toys for the children of nicaragua 
the contingent will merge june 5 in austin texas with several 
other conveys that originated in northern cities a week ago then 
the entire group involving 50 vehicles and 100 drivers will begin 
the drive through mexico guatemala and honduras to nicaragua 
robert livesay a dorchester mass veteran who hatched the 
project and heads the group that started in boston said a total of 
about 40 tons of humanitarian aid will be delivered by the convoy 
to private relief agencies in nicaragua 
this is a peopletopeople project to feed children not a 
government one to feed war livesay said 
the veterans drive also is designed to promote the larger let 
nicaragua live program under which various peace groups plan to 
send 4200 tons of oats to nicaragua via container ships this year 
the various legs of the convoy will pass through 40 states with 
stops in 90 cities livesay said other groups started in seattle 
missoula mont minneapolis dayton cleveland and cincinnati 
ohio and portland ore 
among the donated supplies driven by the veterans are hospital 
equipment powdered milk and oral rehydration salts to help battle 
diarrhea the no 1 cause of death among nicaraguan infants the 
trucks also will carry stuffed animals and baseball equipment for 
the children 
livesay said he got the idea for the drive during a trip to 
northern nicaragua last fall on behalf of the veterans for peace 
when another veteran mentioned the possibility of a us 
invasion aimed at nicaraguas leftist government he said 
something clicked i said he ought to invade this place ourselves 
with a convoy of real humanitarian aid 
livesay said the kids were saw were malnourished with 
discolored hair and distended stomachs without clothes the war 
had really begun to destroy the ability of the people in the 
countryside to produce 
i saw the situation developing the same way it did in 
vietnam said livesay who worked for the air force security 
branch in vietnam and thailand in the 1960s i couldnt believe 
that after 20 years we just hadnt learned our lesson 
he said the relief materials will be handed over to 
nongovernmental social service agencies in nicaragua including 
the institute of john xxiii and the red cross

could affect the safety of the halfmillion dod department of 
defense personnel who annually fly on eastern aircraft 
the airline handled about 87 million worth of military travel 
business in fiscal 1987 
the decision to extend easterns right to handle military 
business was made by the commercial airlift review board a panel 
created in the aftermath of the december 1985 crash of a chartered 
arrow air dc8 that left 248 soldiers dead 
eastern was told april 11 that suspension proceedings were being 
started 
officials of the airline met with the air force on april 25 and 
convinced the service they were addressing the problems lt col 
nick lacey chief of the air carrier survey office said today 
they went out of their way to address these as serious 
concerns lacey told a reporter the air force ended up extending 
easterns right to carry military passengers but also decided to 
continue inflight survey observations he said 
the book is still open lacey added 
lacey said the air force survey team expressed concern about 
pilot turnover poor morale among both air crew and maintenance 
personnel antagonism between management and employees and the 
level of manning for certain operations the military inspectors 
also questioned whether eastern was doing enough to audit and 
oversee contractors providing maintenance service lacey said 
eastern is a unit of texas air corp that is locked in bitter 
dispute with employee unions last month the airline was the focus 
of an unusally broad safety investigation by the federal aviation 
administration that involved inspections of all of its airplanes 
corporate officers of eastern maintain most of the complaints 
about airline operation can be traced to disaffected union workers 
and that the carrier is not scrimping when it comes to safety 
they the air force did have some questions concerning 
airline safety and maintenance said paula musto an eastern 
spokeswoman in miami but we reviewed everything with them and we 
think we satisfied their questions we welcome any inspections 
observations or whatever

charles cooper head of the justice 
departments office of legal counsel today became the latest aide 
of attorney general edwin meese iii to hand in his resignation 
cooper said in a letter to meese that he will leave the 
department july 8 and he said in an interview that he doesnt have 
a job 
im just at the beginning of this process of trying to find 
work with a private law firm rather than at the end cooper 
said 
but the resignation is wholly unrelated to the controversy of 
today coopers letter said in a reference to meeses legal 
troubles and a recent series of departures by key aides at the 
justice department 
meese wrote a letter back to cooper thanking him for your 
loyalty support and special vote of confidence 
some will be tempted to characterize my resignation in ways 
that suit their purposes cooper said in his letter 
but he said that i hasten to stress that in leaving the 
department i am carrying through with plans formed in a calmer 
time and based on a host of personal and professional 
considerations cooper said he had long planned to leave the 
department this summer to enter private law practice 
while the head of the legal counsels office has remained loyal 
to meese justice department sources said cooper had serious doubts 
about remaining at the justice department two months ago following 
the abrupt resignations of deputy attorney general arnold burns and 
criminal division chief william weld 
coopers announcement comes several weeks before independent 
counsel james mckay is to issue a report on his yearold criminal 
investigation of the attorney general which is expected to raise 
questions about meeses ethical conduct 
i am acutely aware that this is a time of controversy for 
you and for the department and thus is not the most opportune 
moment for members of the departments leadership to be 
departing said cooper 
his letter praised meese for promoting a strict interpretation 
of the constitution a restoration of authority to the states and 
the principle of nondiscrimination 
meese has criticized the courts for not adhering to the intent 
of the framers of the constitution he has argued in favor of 
federalism a more equitable balance of power between the state and 
federal governments the attorney general has constantly criticized 
racial quotas in hiring and promotion as well as the widespread use 
of affirmative action goals and timetables 
cooper who has been at the department almost seven years is 
resigning at a time when polls show that a majority of the general 
public has an unfavorable view of meese whose involvement with 
scandalplagued wedtech corp has placed the attorney general under 
constant criticism for more than a year 
a washington postabc new poll released thursday found that 51 
percent of those surveyed had an unfavorable impression of meese 
while only 9 percent had a favorable impression and 40 percent 
expressed no opinion 
in addition 38 percent said he should resign while 9 percent 
said he should not the poll surveyed 1508 americans by phone and 
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
cooper who played a leading role in the unsuccessful efforts to 
win a supreme court seat for robert h bork has been negotiating 
with several law firms for some time said sources at the justice 
department speaking on condition of anonymity 
cooper is the latest justice department official to announce his 
departure in an exodus which began march 29 with the protest 
resignations of burns and weld burns and weld quit out of concern 
that meeses refusal to resign was hurting the justice departments 
operations morale and public image 
cooper recently traveled to panama to participate in 
negotiations with panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega and 
cooper was among a handful of political advisers chosen by meese to 
conduct a weekend inquiry in november 1986 into the 
administrations secret arms sales to iran the inquiry uncovered 
the diversion of some of the arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan 
rebels triggering the irancontra affair 
there has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections 
of the justice department in the past two months 
five of burns deputies left following his resignation 
virtually emptying the no 2 office in the department and two of 
welds aides quit when he did 
last week meeses chief spokesman terry eastland disclosed the 
attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously 
enough the head of meeses speechwriting unit resigned within 
hours of eastlands disclosure 
it took meese nearly two months to find replacements for the 
posts vacated by burns and weld burns successor utah trial 
lawyer harold christensen will fill the slot on an acting basis 
pending completion of the senate confirmation process welds 
replacement edwards sg dennis jr the us attorney in 
philadelphia also will serve on an acting basis

schools should revamp physical education programs 
to help the nations outofshape young people become fitter and 
learn to exercise regularly a fitness expert said friday 
weve got an alarming problem with the deteriorating state of 
fitness in american kids said donald f haydon executive 
director of the american health and fitness foundation theres 
no question that our kids are far more sedentary than 20 years 
ago 
the austinbased foundation which recently completed a fitness 
survey of 20000 schoolchildren primarily in texas presented its 
study at the american college of sports medicine annual convention 
haydon former director of the texas governors commission on 
fitness said his group has developed a pilot program called fit 
youth today to encourage young people to improve cardiovascular 
fitness through regular exercise 
the program was tested last fall in 17 texas school districts 
this spring it is being used by a number of districts throughout 
the country he said 
previous fitness programs simply tested students once annually 
through programs such as the one sponsored by the presidents 
physical fitness council but the fyt program includes an 
eightweek training program of running and calisthenics followed 
by a fourpart test 
haydon said that of the 20000 students participating in last 
falls study 29 percent reached the programs fitness standards 
after the eightweek regimen 
part of the problem is that schools emphasize prowess at the 
expense of general fitness said william g squires an associate 
professor of biology and physcial education at texas lutheran 
college in seguin 
the researchers also said parents should take an active role in 
encouraging their children to pursue physical fitness 
parents check their kids math homework but how many parents 
actually pay attention to the fitness levels of their kids

the justice departments civil rights chief 
leveled a scathing attack against congress for exempting itself 
from civil rights laws and denied that he lied to senators last 
year about a louisiana voter challenge case involving the 
republican party 
it is almost laughable to sit here and listen to these grand 
protestations by members of congress about this administrations 
civil rights record william bradford reynolds told the senate 
judiciary committee on thursday 
referring to frequent complaints from liberals that the reagan 
administration is trying to turn back the clock on civil rights 
reynolds said this chamber has not seen fit in over 200 years to 
reach out and even once wind the civil rights clock that watches in 
forced silence over its activities 
congress has exempted itself from a myriad of civil rights laws 
dealing with discrimination in employment and other areas 
senate judiciary committee members did not respond directly to 
reynolds comments but sen edward kennedy dmass strongly 
criticized reynolds for adopting a confrontational approach to 
dealing with civil rights issues 
kennedy cited a feb 22 memo circulated in the justice 
department in which reynolds said that we must polarize the 
debate in the waning months of the administration on issues 
ranging from aids to capital punishment to prison conditions 
when it comes to civil rights under the reagan administration 
reynolds is the name and polarization is the game kennedy said 
when sen paul simon dill questioned whether polarizing the 
debate was prudent reynolds replied that i stole a page from 
your own book and said kennedy had been confrontational as well 
reynolds is counselor to attorney general edwin meese iii as 
well as assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights 
division 
another judiciary committee member sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio accused reynolds of lying last year and of rejecting 
subordinates advice to launch an fbi investigation into a 
republican party voter registration challenge in louisiana 
metzenbaum disclosed memos by reynolds civil rights division 
subordinates urging that the fbi look into possible criminal 
violations of the voting rights act in connection with a gop voter 
registration challenge aimed at predominantly black precincts in 
louisiana in 1986 
one memo to reynolds dated oct 7 1986 from an attorney in 
the voting section rebecca wertz said that if the voter 
registration challenge were to be found to be a conspiracy to 
disenfranchise black voters that would be a criminal violation of 
the voting rights act she noted that it is a crime punishable by 
up to five years in prison to deprive anybody of a right under the 
voting act 
in march 1987 reynolds told the committee that it was the 
conclusion of everybody who looked at the matter from the 
divisions voting section that there was no violation of the 
voting rights act that would allow us to go in and prosecute 
you misstated the facts you lied to the committee 
metzenbaum told reynolds who responded that metzenbaum was stating 
halftruths 
reynolds said that another part of the justice department the 
criminal division was consulted on the matter and concluded that 
no criminal investigation was warranted however after the 
hearing one of reynolds deputies jim turner said that the 
criminal division reviewed whether blacks were fraudulently 
registered but did not review whether the gops challenge to the 
voters might have violated the law 
reynolds and turner insisted that subordinates in the civil 
rights division ended up agreeing that no fbi probe was needed 
since the case involved the republican party i wanted to be 
darn sure i wasnt going to do something they would question us 
about later reynolds said 
after the hearing turner said that the decision not to launch 
an fbi probe before the election was made out of concern that the 
existence of an fbi investigation might influence the outcome of 
the election

by shuffling the summit schedule and 
questioning delegations set to meet with president reagan kremlin 
leader mikhail s gorbachev is sending an unmistakeable signal that 
he intends to seize the initiative during the pairs moscow 
faceoff 
the challenge facing reagan as he awaits the start of the summit 
sunday is to maintain his wellrehearsed game plan or to alter it 
to compete with the soviet leader 
the soviets already have scrambled the schedule for the talks 
opening monday and apparently imposed restraints on some of the 
people who hoped to meet with reagan 
one of two summit sessions scheduled for monday was scrubbed 
although the time allotted for the two leaders to meet 6 hours 
was maintained 
the soviets gave no specific explanation saying an internal 
function required the cancellation 
the white house puzzled at first decided to describe the 
decision as mutual and not make a fuss 
moreover gorbachev will take the unprecedented step of holding 
a news conference next wednesday the day before the summit ends 
according to an official soviet source who spoke only on condition 
he not be identified 
never before has a general secretary of the soviet communist 
party met formally with reporters on home territory the source 
said 
meanwhile a leningrad refusenik roald zelichenok said in 
a telephone interview that kgb secret police had warned him against 
accepting an invitation to meet reagan on monday 
the jewish dissident who has been refused permission to 
emigrate to israel for more than 10 years said he was told in 
light of security measures around moscow he would not be 
permitted to leave leningrad 
there were reports too that some of the church officials due 
to meet reagan at the danilov monastery also were being kept away 
the white house said thursday that everyone invited to attend 
both gatherings would be there 
and in moscow officials showed no concern over the meetings and 
sought to minimize their impact 
vladimir f petrovsky said the us president is certainly 
free to decide who of soviet citizens he finds interesting and 
useful to meet with outside the framework of the official events 
but he added this american move is hardly aimed at improving 
mutual understanding between the usa and the ussr 
reagan has arranged for howard h baker jr the white house 
chief of staff to make a flight to helsinki with the text of the 
treaty the two leaders signed last december in washington to 
abolish landbased nuclear ballistic and cruise missiles in the 
range of 300 to 34000 miles the senate is in the final stages of 
ratifying the pact 
if the senate acts in time baker on saturday will bring the 
instruments of ratification with him to helsinki they will be 
presented in ceremonial exchange with gorbachev reagan intends to 
use the occasion to extol the agreement his only dent in the 
nuclear arms race in 7 years in office 
gorbachev clearly has another agenda in mind for the summit one 
that does not focus on human rights or even arms control 
with negotiations stymied on a bigger treaty to reduce 
longrange nuclear weapons gorbachev is looking elsewhere to give 
the summit some substance his sights are focused on regional 
hotspots and he has begun to make his moves 
the first of course was completing an agreement in geneva to 
withdraw the soviet troops that have occupied afghanistan since 
1979 
the second was the word passed by vietnam a soviet ally that 
it would withdraw 50000 soldiers from cambodia gorbachevs third 
move which could come at the summit or directly afterward is the 
prospective withdrawal of 50000 to 100000 soviet troops from 
eastern europe 
these bold initiatives are bound to win gorbachev points for 
peace around the world and they could put reagan on the defensive 
in moscow 
two years ago at the iceland summit reagan was forced to 
respond to gorbachevs arms control initiatives 
this time the president may have to adjust his script to the 
soviet leaders oneupsmanship on the ground

statepaid lawyers for floridas death 
row inmates say they can no longer defend their clients because 
they are out of money and have asked the state supreme court to 
halt all executions or have counties pay up 
five men are scheduled for execution between june 22 and july 8 
but their lawyers dont have money to travel to hearings or summon 
expert witnesses larry spalding director of the office of capital 
collateral representative said thursday 
he accused gov bob martinez of signing death warrants on 
sheer whim to keep the pressure on defense lawyers spalding 
blamed his money woes on an unprecedented number of pending death 
warrants and being forced to move his office to more expensive 
quarters when the tallahassee municipal government took over its 
former building 
spalding on thursday asked floridas high court to halt all 
executions or order counties where the convicts were sentenced to 
pay their legal costs 
the court scheduled oral arguments on the request for june 7 
martinez has signed 20 warrants since the beginning of the year 
almost as many as in all of 1987 only one execution however has 
been carried out so far this year that of willie jasper darden on 
march 15 
joe spicola the governors general counsel responded that 
spaldings inability to handle his agencys budget is a perfect 
example of why martinez has ordered a criminal investigation of the 
office 
the governor earlier this year directed the florida department

more than 60000 has been raised to repair 
scratches made by vandals on the vietnam veterans memorial thanks 
to the efforts of veterans organizations and radio stations 
nationwide a fundraising official said friday 
people have been exceedingly generous jan scruggs founder 
and president of the vietnam veterans memorial fund said 
scruggs whose struggle to get the memorial built will be 
portrayed sunday in the nbctv movie to heal a nation said he 
was surprised that so many people were interested in contributing 
money to repair the memorial which has become the most heavily 
visited monument in washington since it was dedicated six years ago 
the national park service on may 2 said it had discovered 8inch 
scratches including one resembling a swastika on two of the 
memorials 140 polished granite panels scratches also were found 
later on a third panel on the 493foot wall which contains the 
names of those killed in the southeast asian war 
scruggs said neither the fund nor the park service solicited 
contributions instead the money which he called gratifying 
was raised by groups and individuals who decided on their own to 
make donations following news accounts of the vandalism the first 
ever reported at the memorial 
a vermont granite expert has been studying ways to remove the 
scratches from the polished granite scruggs said the cost of 
repairs was not yet known 
in the meantime a stone expert has been hired to make temporary 
repairs by filling the scratch marks with synthetic resin that 
matches the mirrorlike surface of the panels according to park 
service spokesman earle kittleman 
after the repairs are made we will use the extra money to buy 
more granite so we will have panels ready to make replacements if 
the need arises scruggs said 
officials at the park service and the veterans fund still are 
hoping to find out who vandalized the memorial us park police 
have been patrolling around the clock since the damage was 
revealed kittleman said 
on monday the park service and the fund will hold their 
traditional memorial day ceremony at the memorial with speeches 
military music and a wreath laying

jo manolidis had been struggling for 
two weeks to get atampt to replace her telephone when 21 bright red 
numbers arrived in three cases at the door 
ms manolidis owner of jos beauty salon said she was glad to 
finally have her phone service back and a red unit was exactly what 
she wanted but 21 seemed a bit excessive 
the girls at work called and said do you know you have 21 
phones here and they all are red she said thursday 
the saga began when ms manolidis was told by atampt on may 6 she 
could pick up a replacement for her leased phone at a local outlet 
that outlet however was out of the model she wanted so she 
ordered one it never came so while visiting omaha on saturday 
she picked up a new red telephone 
when she plugged in the new telephone at her salon monday the 
line was dead she called atampt to report the faulty telephone and 
was told they would have one to her by friday 
ms manolidis said she needed one sooner than that and was told 
that would mean an extra charge for an emergency delivery she 
objected but was forced to hang up before the controversy could be 
resolved 
the next day the 21 red telephones arrived via overnight mail 
accompanying instructions asked her to send back the faulty 
telephone shed picked up in omaha 
an atampt official said thursday she didnt know what caused the 
mistake she guessed it was probably a typing error

results of a controversial firstgrade readiness 
test administered to 90434 georgia kindergartners last month show 
that 92 percent passed education officials said friday 
the test criticized by some as being too stressful for 
5yearolds and 6yearolds is required under the quality basic 
education act enacted in 1985 
this year for the first time passing the test is generally a 
prerequisite for entering the first grade the rules give districts 
the opportunity to make exceptions for children who fail if the 
teacher believes they should be promoted 
the passing rate on this test is pretty much what we 
anticipated said stan bernknopf director of assessment for the 
state department of education state officials had estimated that 
90 percent would pass the test 
the test instrument was the california achievement test 
possible scores ranged from 187 to 602 with the passfail cutoff 
set at 443 and the average for georgia students at about 532 
state school superintendent werner rogers said georgia 
kindergartners scored above the national average in all three areas 
of the test with 79 percent exceeding the national average for 
math 75 percent for visual recognition and 73 percent in sound 
recognition 
children are asked such things as to count the number of items 
in a picture and tell what item in a picture doesnt fit in with 
the others 
while 7396 students did not meet the cutoff score that doesnt 
necessarily mean they wont be promoted to first grade rogers said 
if a childs teacher believes he or she is ready for firstgrade 
work but the test score falls below the cutoff point the child 
will be reassessed he said 
georgia is the only state to administer a paperandpencil test 
to kindergartners as a condition for promotion and some early 
childhood experts have argued that standardized tests are too 
stressful for young children 
but bernknopf said that he never thought it was stressful at 
all 
when kids are taking a test and they know its for real they 
do a little better he said 
john vaughn director of guidance counseling and testing for 
fulton county said the test may not be a good diagnostic tool if 
so many pupils earned a passing score 
id like to have all them pass but the nature of testing is 
if it is valid there would be a higher percent not passing 
he said

ranasinghe premadasa and two other government officials police 
said

bombs detonated prematurely about 200 yards from where the men were 
chairing an outdoor public meeting he said 
police found a third bomb and defused it gunewardene said 
it was a clear attempt to assassinate the ministers 
gunewardene told the associated press by telephone from the town of 
muwara eliya where the explosions occured 
muwara eliya is in central sri lanka about 55 miles northeast 
of colombo 
the officials had gone there to campaign for next thursdays 
provincial elections it wasnt known how many people were at the 
meeting police said it was well attended 
gunewardene said two critically injured sinhalese men were found 
at the bomb site the men were believed to be carrying the bombs 
toward the meeting when they went off 
gunewardene said the injured men were being treated and would be 
interrogated later 
both were believed to belong to the nationalist sinhalese 
peoples liberation front gunewardene said 
the front is opposed to the peace accord signed last july to end 
the nearly fiveyear tamil separatist war in the north and east of 
the island 
the front has been blamed for the deaths of more than 290 
politicians and government workers since the agreement was signed 
july 29 by president junius r jayewardene and indian prime 
minister rajiv gandhi 
many members of the islands majority sinhalese community 
contend that the pact makes too many concessions to the minority 
tamils 
the other ministers at the meeting were lands minister gamini 
dissanayake and rural industries minister sayuramoorthy thondaman 
dissanayake has been mentioned as a possible successor to 
jayewardene

tried to meet transport and moslem affairs minister mh mohamed at 
his colombo residence

islands 16 million population 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent they claim 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who control the 
government and the army

of the tamil separatist groups the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam has rejected it 
india which has a large tamil population of its own has sent 
more than 50000 troops to the island to try to put down the 
tigers rebellion

students in a rural alabama school district and in eight boston 
schools were told dont drink the water after potentially 
hazardous matter was found in their drinking supplies 
the order to stop using the water at snow hill school about 40 
miles southwest of montgomery ala came thursday on the last day 
of class the alabama department of environmental management which 
tested the water earlier this month found that its coliform 
bacteria count was more than 25 times the level considered 
potentially dangerous 
coliform bacteria are normally found in animals colon in water 
supplies they indicate contamination by fecal matter continued 
high exposure to the bacteria make a person more susceptible to 
digestive disorders said catherine lamar a spokeswoman for the 
environmental agency 
in boston the problem was excessive amounts of lead discovered 
in the water supplies of eight public schools in a television 
stations survey the report prompted testing at all city schools 
over the memorial day weekend said john stobierski of the state 
department of public health 
these schools that have high levels of lead or those that we 
dont have results for will be on bottled water when schools reopen 
on tuesday after the holiday stobierski said 
the drinking water at snow hill school was as bad as you can 
get said joe power chief of the adems public water supply 
branch its like drinking untreated water from a creek or 
river 
power said samples taken by his agency may 16 showed the water 
to be contaminated at more than 25 times the potentially dangerous 
level of coliform bacteria school systems in the state are 
supposed to test their water monthly and report bacterial levels to 
the state and the agency stepped in when it failed to receive the 
reports from the district 
he said students at snow hill have been drinking well water 
contaminated at more than seven times the danger level since 
january when the school reopened after being shut for 15 years 
the 347 students were switched to snow hill from a school in 
pine hill after state officials ordered the county not to use the 
pine hill school which was plagued by leakage of raw sewage and 
other problems a fire destroyed the main campus building at pine 
hill last fall 
power said stomach aches viruses or other illness contracted by 
students since january possibly could have been caused by the 
drinking water 
the districts superintendent odell tumblin said she does not 
believe the problem is as serious as adem indicates 
that water is clear and pure and a lot of families in the area 
have been using the same well for years she said i dont see 
how the water system got poisoned just because the students got 
there 
a new high school is being built in camden but school officials 
plan to use snow hill at least another year 
bostons wnevtv had water samples from 24 elementary schools 
analyzed and discovered that 10 including two private schools had 
lead levels exceeding federal standards 
stobierski said the tainted water was unlikely to cause acute 
lead poisoning but said scientists still dont fully understand 
the chronic effects of lowlevel lead poisoning

an adviser to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
said friday that the united states is violating a peace accord by 
continuing to ship arms to afghanistans anticommunist mujahedeen 
guerrillas 
they are arming quite openly those who want to go on in 
their civil war said yevgeny primakov who has advised gorbachev 
on arranging the soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
primakov head of the institute of the world economy and 
international relations did not specify when the united states 
sent its most recent arms shipment to the mujahedeen 
no did he say whether continued us shipments might halt 
withdrawal of the estimated 105500 soviet troops who are still in 
afghanistan 
this means that the united states will jeopardize the 
situation primakov told a news conference for reporters covering 
next weeks summit talks between gorbachev and president reagan 
it means they will push pakistan into a corner he said 
it destroys the geneva accords 
in washington state department spokesman ben justesen said in 
response to primakovs charges 
the turnover of large amounts of military supplies 
constitutes a continuation of military aid the soviets should take 
their military equipment out with them we will watch soviet 
actions in this area carefully and will follow symmetry in making 
our decisions 
marshal sergei akhromeyev chief of staff of the soviet armed 
forces told reporters thursday that 9500 of his troops have left 
afghanistan since the pullout began may 15 
under the peace accord the soviet withdrawal is supposed to be 
completed by early 1989 
primakovs charge appeared to be part of a pattern of protests 
aimed at pressuring pakistan and the united states to stop aiding 
the mujahedeen 
on thursday the afghan government lodged its fourth protest 
with a un observer mission accusing pakistan of continuing to 
channel arms to the guerrillas 
the guerrillas have said they will continue to fight the 
sovietbacked government in kabul and will ignore the geneva 
accords signed by pakistan and the kabul regime 
the united states and soviet union agreed to act as guarantors 
of the agreement in an exchange of letters each side agreed to 
stop arming its allies in afghanistan if the other followed suit 
the letters which have not been made public also are reported 
to have specified that if either side continued to arm its afghan 
ally the other would provide a commensurate level of weapons to 
its side 
moscow has halted its arms shipments western diplomats say but 
is leaving soviet military bases and massive arms supplies to the 
kabul government as its forces pull out 
the united states has been supplying the mujahedeen with an 
estimated 500 million annually in arms and military supplies 
channeled through pakistan 
about 25 million afghans have fled to pakistan since the 
soviets invaded afganistan in december 1979 and the mujahedeen 
operate out of basis on pakistani soil 
china and saudi arabia also have supplied arms to the mujahedeen 
but have not signed the geneva accords 
an additional 15 million afghan refugees are living in iran 
which is supporting islamic fundamentalist guerrilla groups

oldguard lawmakers from the governing 
nationalist party called for the return of martial law friday after 
violent protests that injured hundreds of people but their younger 
colleagues denounced the idea 
martial law was lifted in july after 38 years in force last 
friday and saturday riot police and demonstrators battled in 
taipei for 18 hours and there has been talk the government might 
bring back martial law 
more than 200 people reportedly were injured and 96 protesters 
were detained in the riots which broke out after a farmers rights 
demonstration the violence was the worst on this island since 
1947 when native taiwanese staged an uprising against nationalist 
forces who had arrived from the chinese mainland 
a group of 75 legislators issued a statement calling the recent 
rioting a bloody incident unprecedented in 40 years they urged 
the government to partially reimpose martial law because the nation 
had reached the moment of life and death 
the statement said violent protests threatened national security 
and taiwans economic development 
most members of the legislative yuan who signed the statement 
were elected on mainland china shortly before 1949 when they and 
the rest of the nationalist government fled to taiwan after losing 
a civil war to the communists 
the nationalist government claims to be the rightful ruler of 
all china 
a group of 27 lawmakers comprised mostly of nationalist 
legislators elected in taiwan issued a statement opposed to a 
return to martial law and said it would drive the vehicle of 
democracy backward 
the rioting was a temporary disorder and the government should 
not easily give up its achievement in democracy the statement said 
since the lifting of martial law under which demonstrations 
were banned protests have been held almost daily by dissidents and 
other groups pressing a wide variety of political and economic 
demands 
newspapers reported thursday that members of the partys 
policymaking central standing committee held heated discussions at 
a weekly meeting wednesday about whether the government should 
reimpose martial law 
taipei police meanwhile turned down an application by a 
farmers group to march in taipei on tuesday claiming the 
organization violated demonstration laws during previous protests 
lin fenghsi spokesman of the group said the farmers wanted to 
march to apologize to taipei residents for last weeks violent 
protest 
also friday the nationalist party announced that three sons of 
the late president chiang chingkuo were elected delegates to the 
nationalist party congress this summer 
chiang who died in january was the son of chiang kaishek who 
led the nationalists to taiwan in 1949 he was the main architect 
of the recent policies of easing the nationalists authoritarian 
grip on taiwan and allowing unofficial contacts with china

a 300mile carpet of algae along the 
southern coast of norway and sweden has killed tons of salmon and 
rainbow trout a norweigan newspaper reported friday 
the singlecell algae has killed all marine life down to a depth 
of 26 feet in some parts of skagerrak strait between denmark and 
norway and in the kattegat belt between denmark and sweden the 
oslo daily aftenposten said 
denmark alarmed by weather reports showing the algae could be 
blown to its shores dispatched a research boat friday to track the 
growth 
ive never experienced anything like it the situation is 
highly dramatic arne nielsen head of the sea pollution 
laboratory of denmarks environment ministry said friday 
nielsen blamed nitrates and phosphorus washed into the sea from 
farms 
authorities say the algae is not harmful to humans but it turns 
to slime on the gills of fish and chokes them to death 
the algae growth extends about 310 miles along the southwest 
coast of sweden from goteborg to the oil center of stavanger 
norway 
wild fish such as herring and flounder have not been as hard hit 
as the trout and salmon grown by norwegian farmers in seaside pens 
experts said those farmers have been advised by marine biologists 
to slaughter their fish 
some major fish farms in western norway have started to tow 
their nets away from coastal areas into norways deep cool fiords 
to avoid the algae threat 
marine biologist einar dahl said it could take weeks or months 
for the algae to disappear according to the newspaper 
he said the algae has always been present in the north sea but 
never in such quantities

iranian gunboats attacked a maltese 
freighter and set it ablaze friday in the strait of hormuz it was 
irans fourth raid in 10 days on ships sailing to or from saudi 
ports 
iran apparently was retaliating for a spate of iraqi raids on 
its oil shipping lanes including one attack that devastated five 
tankers may 14 
iran targets vessels trading with saudi arabia or kuwait because 
it accuses the two oilrich powers of aiding iraq its enemy in the 
7yearold persian gulf war 
the 18000ton don miguel was left burning fiercely after the 
morning attack in the strait of hormuz the gateway to the gulf 
the 18member south korean crew abandoned the vessel shipping 
executives said 
the executives speaking on condition of anonymity also said 
the iranians fired at a helicopter chartered by the us television 
network cbs when it approached the site of the attack the aircraft 
was not hit 
the shipping officials said they were not aware of any us 
warships which patrol the gulf to protect shipping near where the 
iranians struck 
in the past 10 days iran has attacked three other foreign 
ships the don miguel was hit about 12 hours after the 
norwegianoperated mundogas rio was attacked in the same area 
about 25 miles south of irans larak island oil terminal 
kuwait turned to the united states and the soviet union for 
protection of its vital oil shipments from such attacks last year 
putting 11 tankers under the us flag and chartering three others 
from moscow on may 3 the pentagon broadened its role in the gulf 
to allow us ships to aid stricken vessels that arent flying the 
stars and stripes 
oman which shares with iran control of hormuz sent a small 
gunboat to help the don miguel and pick up crewmen from lifeboats 
tugboats of the dutch firm smit helped fight the fire which burned 
for hours 
executives said the ship was badly damaged 
the don miguel is greekowned with a maltese 
flagofconvenience the vessel was under charter to the 
londonbased trans ammonia international traders in sulphur 
shipping executives said the vessel was heading for the saudi 
port of jubail to pick a load of the sulphur but would now be towed 
to fujairah outside the hormuz for inspection of damage

americans disposable personal incomes fell 
09 percent in april the steepest drop in a year as tax payments 
took a big bite out of paychecks the commerce department reported 
friday 
it was the first decline in disposable income since last 
november and the biggest setback since a 25 percent plunge in 
april 1987 when federal taxes took an even bigger chunk of 
americans incomes 
faced with higher tax bills americans balked at taking on any 
big purchases leaving spending basically unchanged in april after 
a big 08 percent rise in march 
before adjusting for taxes personal incomes edged up a tiny 01 
percent in april after a giant 11 percent rise in march 
analysts said they were not unduly concerned about either the 
weak income growth or the lackluster spending in april saying the 
month was influenced by a host of special factors 
they noted that in addition to tax bills spending was also 
depressed by the impact of an early easter which meant consumers 
did their shopping in march siphoning off sales that normally 
would have occurred last month 
the income gain looked weaker because the march figure had been 
inflated by annual bonus payments made to workers at ford motor co 
plus a big jump in farm subsidy payments 
excluding those factors incomes before taxes would have risen 
06 percent in april and 03 percent in march 
but economists said that the big drop in the important category 
of disposable income will have some effect in coming months 
after the shock they got in april i think people will adjust 
their withholding statements to have more taken out of their 
paychecks that will be a slight damper on consumer spending 
said john hagens senior economist at the wefa group an economic 
forecasting firm 
but analysts said they were not too concerned because of 
thursdays reoport that the economy was far stronger in the first 
three months of the year than previously believed the government 
revised its estimate of overall growth as measured by the gross 
national product up to a brisk 39 percent compared to an 
original estimate of 23 percent gnp growth 
hagens said he now believed that growth for the year would come 
in at between 35 percent and 4 percent up as much as a full 
percentage point from his original forecast 
the national association of business economists released a new 
survey friday which also boosted the growth estimate for the year 
to 29 percent compared to a forecast a month ago of gnp growth of 
22 percent 
kathleen cooper chief economist at security pacific national 
bank in los angeles said the survey taken in midmay would 
probably show even higher forecast now based on the big revision 
to the gnp the economy grew 29 percent in both 1987 and 1986 
but still a majority of those polled 574 percent believed 
that a recession would begin in 1989 brought on by rising 
inflation and higher interest rates 
we see inflation coming in at 5 percent and that will cause 
the federal reserve to tighten further and that will raise interest 
rates she said higher interest rates are normally the way we 
get into recessions in this country 
the big decline in disposable incomes in april pushed the 
savings rate down to 38 percent last month compared to a rate of 
47 percent in march 
the commerce department report said personal tax payments 
climbed at an annual rate of 362 billion in april compared to a 
march increase of 109 billion 
but this was still down from a huge 855 billion surge in tax 
payments in april 1987 a year when many americans ended up owing 
more because they had sold longtime investments at the end of 1986 
to escape higher capital gains taxes under the new tax law 
wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 79 billion in 
april down from a march increase of 15 billion which had been 
inflated by special bonus payments made by ford motor co 
farm income fell 76 billion last month compared to an increase 
of 194 billion in march with federal subsidy payments accounting 
for the wide swing 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods fell by 43 
billion while purchases of nondurable goods dropped 141 billion 
purchases of services which include housing costs climbed 116 
billion

a woman was sentenced friday to 14 
years in prison by a judge who blamed cocaine and teenage 
motherhood for the tragedy that resulted in her 9yearold daughter 
losing her legs to frostbite when she was locked in an unheated 
apartment 
workers boarding up an abandoned unheated gary house jan 17 
discovered darlwin carlisle alone and pleading for help from a 
barricaded apartment surgeons who amputated her legs below the 
knee said gangrene had set in four to five days before she was 
found 
her mother darlwin britt 25 pleaded guilty may 6 to felony 
child neglect over the objections of her attorney in a plea 
agreement that dropped two other counts and avoided a trial in 
which her daughter would have had to testify against her 
i think its probable this wouldnt have happened but for 
cocaine said lake superior court judge richard w maroc 
nevertheless he said she appeared to love the child she had when 
she was 15 
when were talking about children having children and drugs 
being involved is it any wonder these things happen he said 
ms britt admitted to cocaine use and asked maroc whether she 
would be sent to a drug rehabilitation center for treatment he 
told her he would recommend that she receive counseling and 
treatment in prison 
maroc said ms britt had no criminal record but he added four 
years to the standard 10year term citing the length of time the 
child was left in the freezing apartment and her permanent 
disability 
investigators said the girl had been in the apartment for nearly 
10 days during a bitter cold spell of nearzero temperatures 
during that time ms britt told school officials her daughter was 
missing classes because of a cut on her foot maroc said 
the court accepted the plea bargain over the objections of 
defense attorney daniel toomey who said prosecutors lacked 
sufficient evidence to show ms britt intended to harm her daughter 
he said ms britt accepted the bargain because she feared 
receiving the maximum 20year sentence if she were convicted by a 
jury 
under questioning by maroc ms britt repeated her willingness 
to accept the deal saying i dont want to go to trial 
she offered no explanation but the rev cozetta olive a 
minister who has counseled ms britt said she woman wanted to 
spare her daughter further trauma 
child welfare authorities placed darlwin carlisle in the home of 
her paternal grandmother katie carlisle of gary 
her physical recovery is superb said deputy prosecutor 
karen coulis her emotional recovery will be much longer perhaps 
for life

former president nixon says a proposed fifth 
reagangorbachev summit after the democratic and republican 
conventions this summer would be meaningless unless both parties 
presidential candidates also agree to attend 
such a meeting nixon said would be a ludicrous threering 
circus 
president reagan held out the possibility of yet another summit 
before he departed wednesday for summit talks with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev in moscow next week 
the german newspaper die welt quoted reagan as saying the 
soviets are interested in concluding a strategic arms reduction 
talks or start treaty with him rather than waiting until his 
successor takes over in january 
nixon said that with only five months remaining before the nov 
8 presidential election too little time remains for the reagan 
administration to complete an arms control agreement that would be 
in the national interest 
once the two major parties choose their tickets for the 
general election an incumbents authority in soviet eyes drops 
to nil he said 
any summit after the two conventions will be meaningless 
unless both the republican and democratic nominees agreed to 
attend in the unlikely event that they did it would be a 
ludicrous threering circus 
nixons views are contained in a column he wrote for this 
weekends editions of the sunday times of london a copy was 
obtained by the associated press 
nixon who had three summit meetings with soviet leaders while 
he was president said reagan doesnt have enough time left as 
president to resolve several important sovietamerican issues 
among them he said are the relationship between defensive and 
offensive weapons systems whether to allow mobile strategic 
missiles and verification of cruise and mobile missiles 
therefore nixon said reagan should concentrate in moscow on 
conventional arms control and regional political conflicts 
trying to rush the start talks toward settlement would put the 
united states in the intolerable position of negotiating against a 
deadline in questions that directly affect our survival nixon 
said 
even signing a draft agreement would be a mistake he said 
that would lock the next administration into an approach that 
focused excessively on cuts in the number of nuclear weapons 
instead of the critical issue the stability of the strategic 
balance he wrote 
nixon said the centerpiece of the us approach should be 
conventional arms control in europe and not any goal of making 
equal cutbacks in us and soviet forces in europe 
while american forces would retreat to the other side of an 
ocean moscows forces would simply take a short train ride to the 
western border of the soviet union he said instead we should 
seek asymetrical reductions in the kremlins armies 
the former president said progress on ussoviet economic 
cooperation must be linked to resolving regional disputes in which 
moscows actions threaten american interests if we want 
gorbachev to take our positions on these issues seriously 
if we do not insist on linkage at the moscow summit we will 
end up subsidizing our own destruction he said

the communist party has outlined a series of 
reforms that could sweep away many political and judicial remnants 
of stalinism but it has failed to say how it will transform the 
economy 
the changes are sketched in a program that will be debated next 
month at a party conference considered crucial to the future of 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
the document published in soviet newspapers friday was 
approved at a central committee meeting this week and stresses the 
soviet unions need to modernize all aspects of society 
it speaks of elections for some posts of reducing some 
adminstrative powers of communist party of limiting the terms of 
office and of democratic reforms 
while the proposal makes no concessions to demands for a 
multiparty system it says social organizations that are not 
limited to communist party members should have a bigger say in 
the political process in future 
the nations laws will be reviewed the document says and we 
must firmly adhere to the following principle everything is 
permissible unless prohibited by the law 
gorbachev has stressed reforms of the judicial and political 
system as crucial to ending the vestiges of stalins dictatorship 
but even if the communist party conference approves all the 
changes their implementation may be slowed by resistance in some 
quarters 
changes envisaged in the political system include a limit of two 
fiveyear terms for for party and government officials all the way 
up to the policysetting central committee and the supreme soviet 
the nations parliament the party also is ordered to keep hands 
off daytoday management of the economy and government and 
concentrate on setting goals 
almost all the proposed changes called the theses for the 
party conference opening june 28 had been raised before by 
gorbachev or his followers 
but in an apparent victory for gorbachev the principle of 
secret ballot elections for some posts was adopted 
the party leader also appears to have gained a chance to sweep 
opponents from positions of influence the conference will consider 
calling for a review of all the partys 19 million members 
the review is likely to focus on the clear struggle between 
orthodox communists used to the authoritarian party system set up 
by stalin and reformers who want to see gorbachevs reforms succeed 
the theses contained strong criticism of what it said was the 
abuse of power under the system built up by stalin and of the 
political and economic stagnation that set in under leonid i 
brezhnev who was in power from 1964 to 1982 
it declared the soviet union was on the brink of an economic 
crisis after brezhnev 
although progress has been made the program said the economy 
still is far from the modern financial and monetary system 
gorbachev wants 
an economist close to gorbachev abel aganbegyan told reporters 
friday that despite three years of reform efforts most average 
soviets have seen no improvement in their lives 
he said a reform of prices which is promised for the early 
1990s is essential 
nikolai shmelev an economist known for his controversial 
proposals said the soviet economy suffers from gross inefficiency 
it has a shortage of 20 million workers in some sectors but 25 
million extra workers in other sectors he said 
in apparent deference to growing grumbling among consumer about 
shortages the theses also stressed that supplies of food and 
consumer goods must be sharply increased 
scientists and educators were castigated for not doing enough to 
introduce new technology and new thinking but the biggest 
criticism was reserved for managers and bureaucrats who still want 
to boss others around 
the only sector of the population praised for its contribution 
to the reform effort was the intelligentsia who have proved the 
most vocal supporters of gorbachevs reforms 
that reflects in part changes that have given soviets more 
interesting newspapers livelier television programs and some 
previously banned films books and music 
if the document is accepted by the 5000 delegates to the 
communist party conference it will mark an important consolidation 
of reforms to date for gorbachev and give him the basis to go 
further in transforming the stalinist system he inherited

here are the main points of central committee 
proposals published in fridays soviet newspapers 
on political pluralism the paper says a salient feature of 
our time is the appearance of a real pluralism of opinions open 
comparison of ideas and interests it does not envisage 
abandonment of the oneparty system but suggests that some social 
organizations outside the party should have a bigger say in the 
political process in future 
local and regional legislatures and the national parliament are 
to play an enhanced role in political debate and to operate under 
legal guarantees that their decisions will not be undone by 
bureaucratic interference 
the legal system is to be strengthened presuming the innocence 
of those on trial and radically reforming the operation of state 
prosecutors soviet laws are to be rewritten and the principle 
adopted that everything is permissible unless prohibited by the 
law 
reforms should allow for the exercise of constitutional 
freedoms freedom of press conscience assembly street 
demonstrations and firmer guarantees of personal rights such as 
the inviolability of the person and the home and privacy of 
correspondence and telephone conversations to name but a few 
party and government officials should be limited to two 
fiveyear terms in office with third terms permissible only by 
majority vote in secret ballot of party and government offices 
concerned the proposals say this practice should extend all the 
way to the central committee and to the supreme soviet or national 
parliament 
due attention should be paid to ethnic relations and political 
institutions formed to articulate ethnic interests made more 
active 
the party should be reformed to prevent a repeat of the abuses 
of power developed under stalin and those who in the past fell 
victim to unjustified political accusations and illegality should 
be rehabilitated

charles cooper a top aide to attorney general 
edwin meese iii handed in his resignation friday but said his 
decision to join the exodus of officials from the justice 
department was wholly unrelated to meeses legal troubles 
cooper the assistant attorney general who heads the office of 
legal counsel said he is just now beginning to look for work 
with a private law firm but he said his decision to leave was not 
based on the fact that independent counsel james c mckay is 
expected to issue a report in several weeks raising questions about 
meeses ethical conduct 
cooper whose resignation is effective july 8 praised meese as 
being almost exclusively responsible for advancing a number of 
issues on the reagan administrations conservative agenda by 
focusing debate on interpreting the constitution and the principles 
of federalism and nondiscrimination 
in an interview cooper said he has an extraordinary 
admiration for meeses ability to withstand the controversy 
that prevails at this time in connection with mckays yearold 
criminal invesgtigation of meese 
cooper said i have not formed any judgments about meese on 
the matters mckay has been examining 
meese thanked cooper in a letter for his loyalty support and 
special vote of confidence 
the independent counsel launched an investigation on may 11 
1987 that has focused on meeses ties to scandalplagued wedtech 
corp and a 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project 
cooper acknowledged he had doubts briefly about remaining at the 
department two months ago when the no 2 department official 
deputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal division chief 
william weld resigned in protest over meeses continued tenure as 
attorney general 
cooper said he at first thought burns and weld might know 
something about the circumstances surrounding ed such as a 
possible determination by mckay that meese had engaged in 
wrongdoing but three days after burns and weld resigned mckay 
announced he had insufficient evidence at that time to seek an 
indictment of meese 
in a letter to meese cooper said he long ago decided to leave 
this summer and that i am carrying through with plans formed in a 
calmer time and based on a host of personal and professional 
considerations wholly unrelated to the controversy of today 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said that in terms 
of staffing the department is in better shape than most agencies 
around town at this point in an administration with many 
officials returning to jobs in the private sector as the reagan 
administration comes to an end 
korten said the department fully expects to have a 
replacement for cooper by the time he leaves 
cooper 36 took the legal counsel post in november 1985 after 
serving as deputy assistant attorney general in the departments 
civil rights division where he worked closely with william 
bradford reynolds 
cooper played a leading role in trying to win a supreme court 
seat for federal judge robert h bork last year but the senate 
rejected bork a vocal conservative by a wide margin 
cooper recently traveled to panama to participate in 
negotiations to try to remove panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega from power he also was among a handful of political 
advisers chosen by meese to conduct a weekend inquiry in november 
1986 into the administrations secret arms sales to iran 
the inquiry uncovered the diversion of some of the arms sale 
proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels triggering the irancontra 
scandal 
there has been a complete turnover of personnel in key sections 
of the justice department in the past two months five of burns 
deputies left following his resignation virtually emptying the 
deputys office and two of welds aides quit when he did 
last week meeses chief spokesman terry eastland said the 
attorney general had fired him for not defending him strenuously 
enough the head of meeses speechwriting unit resigned within 
hours of eastlands disclosure 
it took meese nearly two months to find replacements for the 
posts vacated by burns and weld burns successor utah trial 
lawyer harold christensen will fill the slot on an acting basis 
pending completion of the senate confirmation process welds 
replacement edwards sg dennis jr the us attorney in 
philadelphia also will serve on an acting basis

a child whose fireandbrimstone preaching 
has disrupted his school was suspended for a fifth time friday as 
parents gave his father a petition asking him to stop the boy and 
his two younger children from preaching at school 
the petition was signed by 474 parents and opponents of the 
street preaching by the strode children duffey 10 pepper 6 
and matthew 5 
on friday duffey again ignored requests from eastfield 
elementary school assistant principal shirley ramsey to come into 
school and begin class he was suspended for six days until summer 
break begins 
pepper and matthew are to return to school thursday 
a group led by parent lisa mahan asked permission to present the 
petition to the boys father street preacher david strode while 
he and duffey were receiving duffeys latest suspension papers but 
school officials asked the group to make the presentation off 
school grounds 
the elder strode told the group they didnt know the gospel and 
were going hell the parents responded that they do know the gospel 
and asked strode to stop the preaching by his children 
something bad is going to happen to them said frances 
mcpeters one of the parents i have no mercy on them i dont 
care what happens to them 
mrs mcpeters said the strode children dont understand what 
theyre saying but that they only repeat what they have been told 
at home 
sometimes theyll hold up their bibles and holler the bible 
says and then forget what theyre suppose to say she said 
theyre not preachers theyre children 
strode said friday that the family would be moving before school 
began in the fall and the children would enroll in west marion 
elementary which is in a different district 
but mrs ramsey said she did not think the controversy would end 
because that school district has the same policy requiring students 
to enter the building at 730 am 
school officials have repeatedly said the children are being 
suspended for violating that policy not because they preach

a grand jury refused to indict two police 
officers accused of shooting a former mental patient who had a toy 
pistol but the officers and the toy manufacturer face a 25 
million lawsuit 
police overreacted and the gun looked too real claims the 
lawsuit filed by the victim gerard a mathieu 36 city officials 
also are defendants in the lawsuit 
mathieu was paralyzed from the waist down by a police gunshot 
that cut his spinal cord on may 16 the suit said 
an orleans parish grand jury thursday found no evidence of 
wrongdoing and refused to indict the involved officers whom 
police have not publicly identified 
the shooting happened after police responded to a report that 
someone was looking into the windows of a nursing home the 
officers came upon mathieu sleeping under a tree near the homes 
parking lot 
as the police officers approached the sleeping mr mathieu a 
neighbor yelled dont shoot him he hasnt got any sense the 
police officers then yelled at the sleeping mr mathieu and he 
jumped up with his hands up in the air the suit said police 
said on the day of the shooting that mathieu pointed a gun at 
officers but the suit does not address that issue 
the police officers then hit the ground and opened fire on mr 
mathieu the suit says adding that the officers kept firing 
after mathieu hit the ground hitting him 11 times 
the suit filed by attorney bill quigley said the toy pistol 
was designed to look real 
the merchandising advertising and selling of the plastic toy 
gun is based in large part on the work done by the imperial toy 
corp in making the full scale model of the 9mm automatic pistol 
look like a real gun quigley says in the suit 
in los angeles a vice president of imperial disclaimed any 
liability when the toy is used as a toy there has never been a 
problem and no problem is even foreseeable said jordan kort 
the suit also alleges the policemen named in the suit as john 
doe and ron doe acted too hastily and shouldnt have shot mathieu 
11 times even if they felt threatened 
the city public affairs office refused comment on the suit

a new system has been hooked up to restore 
service to half of illinois bells 35000 west suburban customers 
whose telephones have been faulty since mothers day but some said 
friday that phone trouble persists 
mine doesnt work said erva wilson a hinsdale homeowner 
who was borrowing a neighbors phone to try to get some answers 
about her telephone service problems 
my son tried to make a longdistance call to iowa and he 
couldnt so were still having problems here said raymond 
zimner also of hinsdale 
ms wilson and zimner are two of the thousands of customers 
whose lines were reconnected to a stateoftheart digital 
switching system at 1159 pm thursday 2 weeks after a fire 
ravaged the hinsdale switching station 
since the blaze thousands of customers have had periodic 
trouble completing calls to local numbers and have not been able to 
place calls outside their area code 
though half were reconnected late thursday others will continue 
to have spotty local service and trouble calling long distance 
until sometime in the beginning of june when theyre connected 
to the digital system said illinois bell spokeswoman laura littel 
ms littel said the company has received some complaints from 
reconnected customers friday but that problems with the new system 
should be isolated and can be fixed quickly 
if they call today with trouble it will be cleared up very 
soon after they call its just a matter of tweaking the system and 
finding out where the bug is she said friday 
when you put a machine like this into action usually we have 
weeks and weeks of testing to make sure its running perfect and 
smooth but because this was an emergency situation we rushed the 
job ms littel said 
we did things in reverse order we did a little testing 
turned the machine on and now were dealing with the trouble 
she said 
zimner who owns a delivery and messenger service said my 
business had been down since the fire because i couldnt 
communicate with my clients 
ms wilson a retiree said she was pretty disappointed when 
she picked up the phone friday morning and there was no dial tone 
im much inconvenienced i live by myself so its a bit of a 
concern she said 
i knew that they were supposed to switch over to a new 
machine so i thought today everybodys phone was going to be ok 
but mine isnt ms wilson said 
also friday gov james r thompson said that illinois bell has 
indicated a willingness to assist local governments recover from 
the telephone crisis 
the plan would probably include grants purchase of emergency 
preparedness equipment or some other form of assistance thompson 
said 
thompson also said the office of the state fire marshal is 
investigating the fire if it is determined that the blaze was 
linked to an electrical storm that hit the area businesses and 
local governments could possibly become eligible for federal aid

a government negotiator said friday that 
masked invaders occupying the mexican embassy were not leftist 
guerrillas as a radio network reported but workers peasants 
students and housewives 
another government spokesman said two leftist political parties 
agreed friday to end a huge rural protest by peasants 
a defense ministry communique said 16 people had been killed and 
30 wounded in the past week in a guerrilla attack and several 
clashes between militant peasants and government security forces

into the mexican embassy on thursday that leftist guerrillas had 
taken it over 
omar velazco an assistant attorney general met with 
representatives of the protesters for eight hours friday and gave a 
different description of them to reporters 
he said he was hopeful the sitin would end peacefully 
sitins at embassies and consulates in bogota are fairly common 
and seldom have anything to do with the country involved the 
demands of this group include water for slum areas which are being 
supplied only once a week during bogotas worst drought in 53 years 
a dozen sitins have occurred in the past four years including 
two others at the mexican embassy all have ended with no one being 
hurt 
dozens of soldiers surrounded the twostory building in a 
residential area of northern bogota no guns were seen among the 
protesters who appeared frequently at windows 
mexican diplomats and colombian employees entered and left the 
building undisturbed spectators including journalists were kept 
a block away 
about 40 people occupied the building in addition to water for 
the slums they want an investigation of allegations by leftist 
parties that the army sponsors death squads that have killed more 
than 800 leftists in three years 
the military denies the allegation 
peasants who started marching on half a dozen towns last monday 
also demand an investigation of the death squads 
only three marches continued thursday in the northern states 
of santander north santander and cesar fernando brito assistant 
minister of government said friday the leftist political parties 
patriotic union and peoples front had agreed to end them 
he said the promise was made after government negotiators 
listened to peasant complaints in addition to allegations about 
death squads the peasants have said they want more effective land 
reform and nationalization of foreign oil companies 
according to the defense ministry those killed in the past week 
included four policemen ambushed by guerrillas near medellin 
headquarters of the illegal cocaine traffic 
the others were peasants killed when police claiming they were 
fired on shot into crowds of marchers the ministry said 
a military alert was declared thursday because of the violence 
former president misael pastrana the opposition leader urged 
president president virgilio barco to return from abroad 
pastrana said in a broadcast address thursday that the country 
is in flames 
barco said in lisbon portugal the situation in colombia is 
totally normal in bogota and the rest of the country i dont 
see any reason to abandon the trip we have experienced situations 
such as these in colombia for 30 years 
he said opposition demands for his return were part of a 
psychological war aimed at damaging a very important trip 
after three days in portugal barco will visit the vatican for 
an audience with pope john paul ii and then go to washington

vice president george bush declared 
friday im the underdog and i like it and said his weak showing 
against democrat michael dukakis in recent public opinion polls is 
not a liability 
bush told reporters at his oceanside retreat that the polls spur 
him to wage a more aggressive general election campaign he cited 
his comeback to clinch the republican presidential nomination after 
losing in iowas firstinthenation caucuses 
the vice president also urged a renewal in collapsed 
negotiations to persuade panamanian gen manuel noriega to leave 
power although he earlier opposed those talks 
if we can find some way to get him out and still bring him to 
justice that would suit me just fine bush said adding that he 
would prefer to bring other western hemisphere leaders into the 
negotiating process 
at the same time bush characterized as an outrageous lie 
what he said was a reported suggestion that the reagan 
administration had initiated the talks to help his campaign 
when you read these outrageous charges by a drugrelated 
indicted dictator discount them they are total lies 
and i dont like it being injected by michael dukakis and 
jesse jackson either if they have some proof or they have 
something other than nuance and insinuation let them speak out 
with the atlantic surf pounding behind him bush told reporters 
on the lawn of his family retreat that recent polls including a 
new washington postabc poll showing him trailing dukakis by 13 
points were helping to generate his competitive juices 
im the underdog and i like it bush said it is may and 
the election is in november do i worry about it i dont worry 
about it i like fighting back dukakis is the frontrunner hes 
been decreed that in poll after poll and i like fighting back i 
remember iowa 
bush has scheduled meetings here over the next week with 
advisers and prominent republicans in an effort to get his campaign 
back on track 
among those he met with on friday were govs john mckernan of 
maine john sununu of new hampshire james thompson of illinois 
former housing secretary carla hills former deputy treasury 
secretary richard darman and martin anderson former domestic 
policy adviser to president reagan 
bush conceded that polls showing he far lags behind dukakis 
among women voters were of particular concern 
what ive got to do is more clearly define what i feel on 
certain womens issues one of them will be day care he said 
bush attributed some of his upbeat attitude to his surroundings 
its the maine air he said when i get up here i feel 
its not feistiness but i feel very relaxed about it i dont 
feel troubled by somebody pointing out im behind in the polls 
im coming out of 10 points down in these polls and ive got five 
months to fight back 
theres a little bit of a cholesterol rise the frustration 
level going up in terms of sitting around and listening to jesse 
jackson and michael dukakis dump all over me and the 
administration so im beginning to get a little more combative 
bush also scoffed at polls that suggested americans view michael 
dukakis as more conservative than he 
that by any stretch of the imagination is hard to believe 
he said 
in terms of neighborhood values anticrime pledge of 
allegiance in schools penalties for those who are really 
corrupting these neighborhoods he is on the far left side of 
things i dont think that bluecollar america or ethnic america 
wants to move away from the kinds of values ive been talking 
about

the soviet union is showing a new flexibility 
on such middle east issues as a palestinian state and israels 
refusal to negotiate with the plo a foreign ministry official said 
friday 
in a separate development soviet officials have agreed to 
collaborate with an israeli rabbi and western scholars on a project 
to research soviet collections of jewish historical materials 
a soviet delegation outlined the new position during secret 
talks in madrid this month with foreign minister shimon peres said 
the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
if what they have hinted at is indeed their official position 
then the gaps between us seem bridgeable the official said 
he said the soviets no longer insist that an independent 
palestinian state in the israelioccupied territories be a required 
result of an international conference on the middle east 
the way they phrase it it is up to the palestinians to decide 
who they want to be confederated with he said 
moscow also showed flexibility about the palestine liberation 
organization he said israel calls the plo a terrorist group and 
refuses to negotiate with it 
according to the official the soviets want the plo invited to 
an international conference but said the invitation should carry a 
condition that all participants accept un resolutions recognizing 
israels right to exist 
we see a very clear distinction between the soviet attitude to 
the plo and to syria for example he said syria is a very 
important asset the plo less so they will not sell the plo down 
the river easily but they feel what they have to do to protect the 
plo is less 
the soviet position paper was prepared by alexander zotov the 
communist party central committees deputy director for the middle 
east the official said adding that peres met with a soviet 
delegation first in madrid during a a socialist international 
conference and then in washington and geneva 
chaim billat of the israel institute for talmudic publications 
directed by rabbi adin steinsaltz announced the research project 
thursday he also said the steinsaltz would be allowed to open an 
institute in the soviet union to train jewish scholars 
we consider this as a major breakthrough and what is 
important is that it was the soviet initiative billat said 
the soviet union severed diplomatic ties with israel after the 
1967 middle east war but the foreign ministry said agreement has 
been reached for an israeli consular delegation to be sent there 
for the first time since the break 
a foreign ministry official said the ministry was not aware of 
the research project but welcomed it as a positive development

white apartheid opponents met friday with representatives of an 
outlawed black guerrilla movement but said the two sides formed no 
concrete agreements about reforming their country 
frederik van zyl slabbert former head of the progressive 
federal party met with four national executive committee members 
of the african national congress including information and 
publicity head thabo mbeki 
among the topics discussed was the ancs use of violence to 
bring about reform in south africa the two sides met in a 
frankfurt hotel 
the anc based in lusaka zambia wages a bombing and sabotage 
campaign to oust south africas whiteled government 
no resolutions were adopted and no decisions were taken 
with the anc on that issue slabbert said but he said the 
discussions were frank and open 
i certainly do not condone bomb attacks or violence or tactics 
of terror of any kind he added 
slabbert said the two sides discussed a broad range of issues 
this would be a totally impossible situation in south africa 
that you can have this kind of discussion he said the image 
of the anc amongst whites has been demonized by the state and 
its propaganda 
slabbert director of an antiapartheid think tank said he 
hoped such discussions with the anc and other groups would help 
start a process of dialogue and debate 
we would be happy to facilitate further discussions of this 
kind slabbert said speaking on behalf of his organization the 
institute for a democratic alternative 
slabbert said he was finished with his current round of talks 
with the anc and that he would fly to vancouver on saturday for 
other business 
the four anc delegates met thursday with an eightmember 
delegation headed by wynand malan a parliamentary member and head 
of the antiapartheid national democratic movement 
as they met two bombs exploded in pretoria and injured four 
people south africas law and order minister blamed the anc for 
the blasts 
five delegates from the national democratic movement attended 
fridays meeting between the anc and slabbert as observers 
movement delegate harald pakendorf told reporters 
slabbert resigned from parliament in 1986 saying the body had 
become irrelevant and incapable of solving south africas racial 
problems 
last july slabbert led a group of about 50 south african whites 
for three days of talks with the anc in dakar senegal 
those talks were widely condemned by the south african 
government and rightwing groups who portray the anc as a 
terrorist organization and oppose all contacts with the group 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

in south africa to reject violence in fighting apartheid which he 
said had exacted a terrible toll 
i pray that the christian communities in south africa will 
continue to foster only peaceful means of responding to the 
difficulties of the present situation the pope said in remarks 
to a visiting delegation of south african churchmen including 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu

structures of discrimination requires a change of hearts 
the 10member delegation was a joint group of the south african 
council of churches and the southern african catholic bishops

in their address to the pope the church officials said recent 
government actions in south africa have resulted in bitterness 
resentment and frustration feelings which can easily lead to 
violence 
they said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held in 
johannesburg on may 30 
the emergency convocation will develop effective nonviolent 
action to put pressure on the south african government to sit at 
the negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaborate 
with the unjust system the delegation said in a news statement

victims he said 
tutu called for tougher sanctions by western nations against the 
south african government 
if we do not apply sanctions or if sanctions are ineffective 
what is effective he said if you say sanctions will fail or 
have failed than you can tell us what will succeedthen the very 
last last option available is violence and we have consistently 
expressed our opposition to violence so we say help us 
he criticized japan for its trade links with south africa 
we hope that the japanese would be embarassed that they have 
stepped into a vacuum he said i hope the japanese will 
remember that they were insulted in south africa when the 
government was enforcing racial classification because they wanted 
the japanese as traders they called them honorary europeans i 
would hope they would get so upset they would go back home

the senate today overwhelmingly approved a 
treaty eliminating us and soviet intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles ratifying the first major arms pact between the two 
superpowers in 16 years 
the final vote was 935 ratification requires the approval of 
twothirds of the members present and voting 
approval of the treaty came in time for it to be presented to 
president reagan at his summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev which begins sunday in moscow 
it also gave cause for optimism to those who see the relatively 
modest inf accord as paving the way for a more ambitious treaty 
making deep cuts in the two sides arsenals of longrange nuclear 
missiles 
we are making a breakthrough said senate majority whip alan 
cranston dcalif it is not a substantively significant 
treaty but it lays the foundation for future treaties that 
can substantially reduce the scale cost and dangers of this arms 
race 
senators voting against the treaty were republicans jesse helms 
of north carolina steve symms of idaho gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire malcolm wallop of wyoming and democrat ernest hollings 
of south carolina 
sens joseph biden ddel and john glenn dohio did not vote 
the pact was the first ussoviet weapons treaty to be approved 
since the 1972 accord on antiballistic missiles 
white house officials in washington issued a statement from the 
president following the vote in which reagan said i am very 
pleased with the action of the united states senate in consenting 
to ratification of the inf treaty in two days i will arrive in the 
soviet union to meet with general secretary gorbachev to discuss 
our fourpart agenda todays action by the senate clearly shows 
support for our arms reduction objectives 
as it moved toward approval the senate adopted strong language 
governing future interpretations of the mediumrange missile 
treaty and turned aside a series of republican amendments that 
would have undermined that provision 
i think weve closed all the loopholes we know about in this 
treaty and its a much better treaty than when it was sent to 
congress said majority leader robert byrd dwva 
thursdays session had ended on a testy partisan note with byrd 
threatening to let the treaty languish if republicans continued to 
seek what he saw as debilitating amendments 
approval of the treaty was considered certain because it 
requires a twothirds vote of the senate or 67 votes and as many 
as 90 senators have expressed support for it but the possibility 
of delay remained alive 
byrd warned gop senators that they risked embarrassing their own 
president by failing to deliver the approved treaty in time for the 
sunday start of the summit 
this is no empty threat byrd admonished senators if 
were going to continue to have mickey mouse amendments like this 
the president is not going to have his treaty before he leaves the 
summit 
byrd and gop leader bob dole rkan informed reagan of the 
decision during a telephone call to helsinki moments after the 
vote the two leaders accepted reagans invitation to come to 
moscow next tuesday and bring the ratification documents with them 
one amendment an attempt by sen malcolm wallop rwyo to 
make any soviet violation grounds for us withdrawal from the 
treaty was defeated on a vote of 6630 and a move by sen larry 
pressler rsd to require reagan to certify at the summit 
whether the soviets are living up to their human rights 
obligations also was defeated 8610 
on thursday byrd had won overwhelming bipartisan passage of an 
amendment stipulating that the white house will be bound in the 
future by the interpretation of the treaty as expressed by 
administration officials during congressional hearings 
any effort to change that interpretation would have to be 
approved again by the senate before becoming valid said the 
amendment which passed on a vote of 7227 
the senate has clearly made visible that it is an equal 
partner with any president in the making of treaties byrd said 
after the provision was adopted and i hope that will be a 
sobering impact on this president and on mr gorbachev when they 
sit down and discuss another agreement on limiting longrange 
nuclear weapons 
the provision grew out of a dispute with the reagan 
administration over white house efforts to redefine the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty with the soviets to allow greater 
latitude for testing of reagans star wars missile defense program 
but a few hours after the vote on the byrd amendment sen pete 
wilson rcalif came close to undermining the provision by 
proposing a change stipulating that the united states could not be 
bound by any interpretation of the treaty that is not equally 
binding on the soviet union 
wilsons proposal was killed 5345 and an angry byrd sent the 
senate home for the night the vote was virtually a partyline 
division 
two similar attempts by sen arlen specter rpa were defeated 
today by wider margins 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty signed by reagan 
and gorbachev in washington on dec 8 requires the elimination 
within three years of all nuclear missiles with a range of 300 
miles to 3400 miles and would result in the destruction of 867 
us missiles in europe and 1752 soviet missiles 
while those numbers represent a relatively small slice of each 
sides total nuclear arsenal the pact is regarded as particularly 
important because it breaks a long drought in armscontrol 
agreements between the two sides and sets the stage for progress on 
a much larger goal massive cuts in each sides longrange nuclear 
missile fleet 
it was also important because it would be the first treaty to 
actually require the destruction of weapons rather than simply 
slowing growth in their numbers and its farreaching verification 
provisions include the first onsite inspections allowed by either 
superpower

some other republicans have had in drawing votes from women would 
be discussed during the coming week of meetings with gop governors 
and other party officials at his kennebunkport maine retreat

cia as well as the failed negotiations to get him out of power

united states dukakis said friday in albuquerque nm you 
cant be serious about waging a real war against drugs when we have 
an administration that cant say no to noriega

administration policies dealing with noriega said the us goal 
remains the same despite the breakdown in talks designed to remove 
him from power

justice that would suit me just fine bush said in a news

hundreds of syrian soldiers wearing 
bulletproof vests over combat fatigues moved into the south beirut 
slums friday halting a threeweek war between rival shiite moslem 
militias that killed nearly 300 people 
the intervention under a syrian agreement with iran is 
expected to increase pressure for the release of the 18 foreign 
hostages in lebanon who include nine americans 
most are believed held in the slums by extremists linked to the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god which gained control of 
nearly all south beirut in the battle with the amal militia that 
began may 6 
hezbollah and amal a mainstream group allied with syria 
stopped shooting as the soldiers began moving in at 11 am 
a few hours earlier syrias four top generals in lebanon 
escaped harm in an ambush in a south beirut neighborhood controlled 
by hezbollah 
dozens of bullets hit the generals mercedes but its armor 
plating saved them otherwise there would have been no 
survivors a police spokesman said 
as the shiite guns fell silent fighting broke out in the bourj 
elbarajneh palestinian refugee camp between prosyrian guerrillas 
and fatah the main army of the palestine liberation organization 
police said they had no word on the cause or casualties in the 
camp which is adjacent to the shiite slums 
in washington the state department said of the syrian move 
we welcome an end to the suffering of the civilian residents of 
the southern suburbs we hope the current arrangement which 
includes a lebanese police element can be a first step toward 
restoring the central governments authority 
about 900 syrian infantrymen in three groups advanced on foot 
into the 16 square miles of tinroofed huts and cementblock 
apartments next to the beirut airport 
they carried machine guns and shoulderfired grenade launchers 
following the first group of syrians were 52 lebanese policemen 
with automatic rifles 
syrian soldiers set up five checkpoints along a disengagement 
line between the shiyah neighborhood held by amal and the 
hezbollahcontrolled ghobeiri district where the generals were 
ambushed 
the line stretched through two miles of gutted shops smoldering 
wrecked cars and bulletscarred cementblock shanties broken power 
cables dangled on streets littered with glass shards and spent 
cartidges 
young hezbollah fighters on the slums fringes stared intently 
at a group of 20 american and british journalists who traveled 
from damascus with syrian escorts to cover the deployment 
i feel like a juicy tbone steak in front of a hungry man 
one reporter said 
checkpoints also were established at key road junctions in the 
hay moawad and mesharrafieh neighborhoods controlled by hezbollah 
wailing women on sidewalks and balconies showered the syrians 
with rose water and rice in a traditional gesture of welcome 
animals they are all animals animals killing animals a 
man shouted in english from in front of his shattered house when he 
saw western correspondents covering the syrian advance 
he said hezbollah fighters seized his home from amal militiamen 
in the final phase of the battle which according to police killed 
a total of 296 people and wounded 1000 
hezbollah gained control of 90 percent of the area which has 
long been a refuge for kidnappers hijackers and assassins 
reporters saw two bulldozers clearing mounds of earth and 
pushing sandbag barricades from the streets syrian specialists 
defused land mines and unexploded bombs 
half an hour before the deployment began shell blasts and 
bursts of gunfire resounded across beirut from the shiite slums 
police said they did not know what started the shooting both 
sides had pledged to observe a final ceasefire 
abdul hadi hamadi the hezbollah security chief in beirut said 
hezbollah and amal were withdrawing their fighters from all south 
beirut neighborhoods and would put them on the line that separates 
the capitals moslem and christian sectors 
his brothers mohammed ali and abbas are held in west germany 
on terrorist charges mohammed ali is accused of the 1985 twa 
hijacking in which a us navy diver was killed and 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
hamadi represents hezbollah on a fourparty committee set up 
friday to supervise the truce 
when the agreement was announced thursday a syrian official 
told the associated press privately ending the fighting will 
create new hope for the hostages and syria will spare no effort to 
secure their release 
he said preserving their lives was the first priority then 
there can be hope for their release through negotiations 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press kidnapped march 16 1985 
there was no word on when the syrians would send tanks and other 
armor into the slums but the second phase of the deployment was to 
be completed saturday 
an estimated 7500 syrian troops 100 tanks and 400 armored 
personnel carriers ringed the slums for 13 days waiting for orders 
to move 
syria has 25000 soldiers in eastern and northern lebanon and 
about 7500 patrolling moslem west beirut 
president hafez assad of syria has become lebanons main power 
broker during 13 years of civil war but iran has used hezbollah to 
challenge syrian influence among the 12 million shiites the

president reagan underscoring a key 
theme for the superpower summit said friday reforms championed by 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev are new and good but that 
the kremlin still falls short of meeting international standards on 
human rights and freedom 
two days before his arrival in moscow reagan said soviet 
practice does not or does not yet measure up to soviet 
commitment under the 1975 eastwest agreement known as the 
helsinki final act 
the senate gave reagan a big presummit boost friday when it 
ratified by an overwhelming 935 vote the treaty outlawing 
mediumrange nuclear missiles which the president and gorbachev 
signed at their washington summit last december 
reagan issued a statement saying he was very pleased with 
the senate vote which he said clearly shows support for our arms 
reduction objectives 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva and minority 
leader robert dole rkan who telephoned the president in 
helsinki with the news accepted reagans invitation to fly to 
moscow on tuesday to witness a ratification ceremony the following 
day 
reagan made his human rights speech before an invited audience 
of about 1200 people in the austerelydesigned marble auditorium 
of finlandia hall where the helsinki accords were signed by 35 
nations including the soviet union and united states 
under the agreement the soviets pledged to provide more liberty 
for their people and those in eastern europe and yet 13 years 
later reagan said the cases of divided families and blocked 
marriages remain on the eastwest agenda while russians trying to 
emigrate are subjected to artificial quotas and arbitrary rulings 
and what are we to think of the continued suppression of those 
who wish to practice their religious beliefs reagan asked 
at the same time he said gorbachevs twin campaigns of 
glasnost or openness and perestroika the restructuring 
of the economy are words that to our ears have a particularly 
welcome sound 
thirteen years ago reagan and other conservatives had opposed 
the us signing of the helsinki agreement because it implicitly 
accepted eastern european boundaries set after world war ii in 
moscows favor 
yet reagan spoke glowingly of the accords friday saying and 
despite the doubts of the critics for the past 13 years the 
signatory states have mustered the political will to keep on 
working and making progress 
the address coupled with an official welcoming ceremony earlier 
at the presidential palace marked the only time reagan ventured 
from the seclusion of a government guest house where he is spending 
3 days resting and preparing for the summit 
in other developments 
a soviet source in moscow declining to be named publicly said 
gorbachev plans to hold a news conference during the summit the 
first time a communist party general secretary will have held such 
a session on home territory 
yevgeny primakov a gorbachev adviser accused the united 
states of violating a peace accord by continuing to ship arms to 
afghanistans anticommunist mujahedeen guerrillas 
viktor karpov a top soviet arms control official called on 
the united states to speed up negotiations on a treaty to cut 
longrange nuclear arsenals by making good on promises of 
compromise 
the white house said that reagan intends to raise the issue of 
the vietnamese occupation of cambodia with gorbachev and said it 
hopes reports of a possible troop withdrawal provide impetus for 
the talks 
accompanied by his wife nancy the president will depart sunday 
morning on a 1hour flight to moscow for his fourth summit with 
gorbachev since november 1985 they are to meet a total of six 
hours from sunday afternoon until wednesday morning the two will 
say goodbye to each other thursday 
at soviet insistence the number of meetings was cut from five 
to four reagan professed to be unconcerned telling reporters at 
the palace there only had been four meetings at the washington 
summit last december 
i think we have to recognize that the soviet government has 
normal business that has to be conducted and we have to schedule 
accordingly thats what we did in our summit in our town reagan 
said as he posed for pictures with finnish president mauno koivisto 
in a secondfloor salon adorned with silken draperies and crystal 
chandeliers 
reagan also was asked about reports that the soviets were 
blocking various dissidents from attending a planned meeting with 
him in moscow on monday he looked quizzically at secretary of 
state george p shultz seated to his right and replied we do 
the best we can 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the us embassy in 
moscow has received assurances from the soviets they will not block 
dissidents and refuseniks from attending the meeting 
the event is on as scheduled and the people we wanted there 
will be there he added fitzwater said the guests were picked 
because they represent the problem that he reagan is trying to 
dramatize 
as for the reports that some people were being stopped from 
attending fitzwater said were trying to ascertain the facts 
and have made an inquiry of the soviets 
underscoring the sensitivity of the topic jewish groups 
gathered in the finnish capital to mount public pressure on moscow 
in behalf of soviet jews waiting for exit permits and those seeking 
wider latitude to teach and practice their religion 
in his speech reagan said human rights would be an integral 
component of his dialogue with gorbachev in a presummit 
briefing assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway said it 
would be subject no 1 
the fact that the superpowers were not able to reach agreement 
on a strategic arms treaty to be signed at the summit probably will 
give even more visibility to the human rights issue 
praising gorbachev for his glasnost and perestroika 
reagan said that since he began his campaign things have 
happened that all of us applaud 
he hailed the release from exile or labor camps andrei sakharov 
irina ratushinskaya anatoliy koryagin josef begun and other 
dissidents and prisoners of conscience 
reagan also noted that controversial books and movies are being 
distributed even though they are critical of the soviet past and 
present the soviets also are allowing a higher level of emigration 
and greater toleration of dissent and are beginning to pull their 
troops out of afghanistan he said 
all this is new and good he said but there is another 
list defined not by us but by the standard of the helsinki final 
act and the sovereign choice of all participants including the 
soviet union to subscribe to it 
reagan on friday said he welcomed every sign that the soviets 
and their allies are ready not only to embrace but to put into 
practice western values 
the house of democracy is a house whose doors are open to 
all reagan said 
he renewed his call for gorbachev to tear down the berlin wall 
and other barriers between east and west 
they could also give legal and practical protection to free 
expression and worship reagan said 
he also urged adoption of an independent judiciary free 
election of lawmakers use of secret ballots in voting and freedom 
of assembly 
before reagan spoke us jewish activists for soviet jews urged 
the president to remind the soviets that human rights were 
indirectly linked to progress in arms control 
morris b abram chairman of the national council for soviet 
jewry said jewish emigration is a test of whether arms 
reductions can succeed 
abram called the improvement in jewish emigration figures 
insignificant compared with those who wish to leave its 
smoke and mirrors as far as the the right to leave is concerned

a federal appeals court friday upheld a 
federal reserve board decision to allow an affiliate of chase 
manhattan corp to underwrite and deal in commercial loan paper 
under strict limitations 
the us circuit court of appeals here rejected a challenge by 
the securities industry association which contended that allowing 
an affiliate of a commercial bank to deal in loan securities 
violated the glasssteagall act of 1933 
but a threejudge court unanimously upheld the feds decision to 
allow the chase commercial corp to underwrite and deal in 
commercial paper provided the transactions did not exceed 5 percent 
of its gross revenues 
the court in an opinion by circuit judge james buckley noted 
that the fed had approved a similar application by bankers trust 
new york corp 
buckley joined by judges harry edwards and david sentelle said 
the fed had correctly interpreted the law as allowing a bank 
affiliate to engage in a limited number of commercial paper 
transactions 
the fed correctly decided that the prohibition on bank 
affiliates principally engaged in securities transactions did 
not apply in this case the court said 
the statute permits banks to affiliate with firms that are not 
principally engaged in securities transactions buckley wrote 
the board reasonably concluded that principally does not 
include a firm whose commercial paper transactions are subject to 
the limits included in its order

proposed us legislation to 
tighten economic sanctions against south africa would hurt it more 
than previous boycotts a us business group said friday 
the american chamber of commerce in south africa said limited 
us sanctions imposed in 1986 carried little impact but 
legislation now being considered by congress would have 
farreaching negative effects on all companies operating in south 
africa and on the south african economy as a whole group 
officials said 
the chamber which represents interests of us companies in 
south africa opposes sanctions five chamber members traveled to 
washington in april and met with congressmen and aides to lobby 
against additional sanctions 
the measures now being debated dwarf anything thats been done 
so far said adriaan botha executive directer of the group 
both houses of congress are weighing sanctions designed to 
protest south africas apartheid policies of racial segregation 
the two similar bills would cut virtually all economic activity 
between the two countries 
the moves would include disinvestment by all us companies 
whose south african investments are estimated at 11 billion 
all trade would be banned except for certain strategic minerals 
the united states buys from south africa us imports from south 
africa in 1987 were about 13 billion and exports were also 13 
billion 
botha said the south african governments february decision 
effectively banning 17 leading antiapartheid organizations had put 
the sanctions issue back on the boil in the united states 
the limited sanctions approved by congress in 1986 over 
president reagans veto banned importation of certain goods and 
halted direct air links between the two countries 
the chamber said south africa has become complacent about 
further sanctionsdisinvestment due to the fact that in the short 
term a large number of individuals and companies have benefited 
many american businesses that left south africa sold profitable 
operations to local businessmen at bargain prices about 160 
american companies have departed in the past two years while about 
155 remain 
a wide range of south africans including some blacks and 
antiapartheid whites oppose sanctions on the grounds that blacks 
are most likely to suffer any economic hardships that result 
proponents of sanctions say economic pressure will speed up the 
governments race reforms 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

a west german prosecutor has stopped the 
investigation of a shipment of heavy water a material used in 
nuclear weapons production that may have been transported 
illegally to the middle east a us expert and state department 
sources said friday 
gary milhollin an american expert on the international market 
in heavy water said a dusseldorf prosecutor has dropped the 
investigation because he was convinced that documents were in order 
for shipment of the norwegianmade heavy water by a west german 
company in 1983 
he has decided that the water went where it was supposed to go 
and has halted the investigation said milhollin who is a 
university of wisconsin law school professor on leave to the 
natural resources defense council in washington 
the associated press in frankfurt was unable to reach the west 
german prosecutor for comment on the report which was the second 
allegation recently that norwegianproduced heavy water had been 
diverted illegally 
milhollin and a state department official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said the 1983 heavy water shipment may have 
been diverted secretly to india by way of the middle east 
the state department official said india has an interest in 
acquiring heavy water secretly he said undocumented heavy water 
could be used secretly to produce and stockpile plutonium which 
in turn could be used to make atomic weapons in violation of the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
milhollin said that in 1985 a west german company attempted to 
hire an airline to fly undocumented heavy water to bombay india 
but that the airline declined to take the shipment because of this 
history he said it is widely speculated that india received the 
earlier secret shipment 
the indian government has denied the heavy water shipment was 
transported to india 
heavy water or deuterium oxide is used as a modulator in a 
nuclear reactor it permits reactors to run on natural uranium 
instead of the more expensive and more tightly controlled enriched 
uranium fuel a byproduct from the nuclear reactor is plutonium 
the heart of nuclear bombs 
on tuesday the norwegian government said it also was 
investigating whether a 1986 shipment of heavy water to rumania had 
been diverted improperly romania on wednesday denied reports in 
the hungarian news media it had sold the 12 ton heavy water 
shipment to israel 
the state department source said friday that officials in norway 
were continuing to press for an investigation of the 1983 west 
german shipment 
a norwegian company norsk hydro sold the shipment to the west 
german concern rohstoff einfuhr under the terms of the 
international nuclear nonproliferation treaty such sales are 
subject to inspection and close documentation west germany and 
rumania are parties to the treaty 
milhollin said norsk hydro officials said they have four 
documents showing rohstoff einfuhr was buying the heavy water for 
shipment to frankfurt the documents include an export license from 
the norwegian government an import certificate from west germany 
an airbill from west african airlines which was transporting the 
shipment and a sales contract between the two companies 
despite the documents however the shipment was flown from 
norway to switzerland where another 66 tons of cargo was added 
the west africa airlines plane then flew from switzerland to dubai 
in the united arab emirates it later left dubai but its 
destination was not been documented milhollin and the state 
department official said 
milhollin said the west german prosecutor decided to drop his 
investigation after rohstoff einfuhr provided copies of a telegram 
and a letter showing the destination of the heavy water shipment 
had been changed from frankfurt to switzerland the west german 
company claims these documents were sent to norsk hydro in norway 
officials at norsk hydro however claim the documents never 
were received and that the heavy water was shipped with the 
understanding that it was going west germany 
fifteen tons of heavy water is sufficient to produce about 13 
pounds of plutonium a year a bomb the size of the first one 
exploded over japan in 1945 uses about nine pounds of plutonium

nasa which expects to use and lose 40 space 
shuttle external fuel tanks in flights over the next five years 
invited industry on friday to come up with ideas for making 
productive use of the tanks in orbit 
now they are allowed to break up in the atmosphere and fall 
into the ocean 
the 152foot tanks which cost 25 million each will be given 
away free but the user must pay for any costs not incurred under 
the present system of discarding them the national aeronautics and 
space administration wants the money up front 
a colorado group which represents 57 university research 
institutions has proposed to use tanks for a wide variety of 
scientific and commercial concerns the group university 
corporation for atmospheric research proposes parking the 
exhausted tanks in orbit but nasa ruled out any such plan 
the use must be stated in advance and a 100000 deposit will be 
required before the space agency provides services or technical 
assistance 
the external tank about the size of a 747 jet transport 
consists of two pressurized fuel tanks one loaded with liquid 
oxygen and one with liquid hydrogen the halfmillion gallons of 
fuel are used up in the 10 minutes it takes for the shuttle to get 
into orbit and the tank is jettisoned just before that point 
the space agencys announcement asks interested american 
companies and nonprofit organizations to propose uses within 90 
days it is in line with president reagans space policy which 
calls for using the tanks for commercial purposes 
nasa plans to launch 40 shuttles through 1994 it said the exact 
number of tanks that could be made available will be decided 
flightbyflight depending on the characteristics of the mission 
and the proposed use for a particular tank

african leaders friday condemned 
western companies for dumping their nuclear and other wastes in 
africa and agreed to ask the united nations to call for an end to 
the practice 
the dumping of nuclear and dangerous industrial waste in 
africa is a crime against africa and the african peoples the 
organization of african unity said in a resolution adopted by heads 
of state during the second day of their threeday summit more than 
30 leaders gathered with their aides at the 50member bodys 
headquarters here 
we will make an appeal to the conscience of the world said 
foreign minister ike nwachukwu of nigeria which sponsored fridays 
resolutions all africa feels strongly about it 
but nigeria and other african states privately chastized some of 
their fellow group nmembers for agreeing to take industrial waste 
in return for millions of dollars one resolution appealed to 
african countries that have signed such agreements to abrogate them 
and those still negotiating to break off talks 
the controversy began this month in guinea when officials 
discovered that a norwegian company had been dumping toxic waste on 
an offshore island the dumping was discovered when the islands 
trees began to shrivel 
several african nations either have signed contracts to accept 
industrial wastes are negotiating or have been approached summit 
sources said the west african nations of benin congo guinea 
bissau and niger reportedly have signed contracts and the tiny 
southern african nation of swaziland and djibouti in east africa 
have been approached 
egypt gambia and sierra leone confirmed during fridays debate 
that they had been approached by companies looking for dump sites 
for toxic wastes but each government said it had rejected the 
proposals all three mentioned a company based on gibraltar but 
would not reveal the name 
guinea bissau said it had asked the us environmental 
protection agency to evaluate a request from a us company to 
export 6 million tons of hazardous waste to the west african nation 
foreign secretary marcellino lima did not say what guinea bissau 
was offered but an environmental source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the deal was worth 15 million 
lima said he doubted guinea bissau would accept 
summit sources and reports from the netherlands also said a 
dutch company had signed an 84 million contract with congo to dump 
1 million tons of chemical wastes in the west african state

an unprecedented government order to include 
the image of a deformed baby in packaging for the acne drug 
accutane is unlikely to be followed by similar orders for other 
drugs with potential sideeffects analysts said friday 
on thursday the drugs maker hoffmanla roche inc of nutley 
released a food and drug administration letter outlining stricter 
warning requirements for the drug which can cause lifethreatening 
damage to fetuses when taken by pregnant women 
among other restrictions the fda also wants la roche to provide 
a consent form to be signed by physician and patient saying they 
understand the risks associated with the drug 
louis c webb of advest group inc in hartford conn a 
business research firm said he doubted that the use of a jolting 
image such as a deformed baby would become widespread in the drug 
industry 
he called the photograph a compromise between banning the drug 
and doing nothing and said such a strong warning was acceptable to 
regulators and the company because accutane is not a lifesaving 
drug 
fda spokesman bill grigg said the side effects of other drugs 
are not as easily captured in a picture as a deformed infant so 
trying to apply images to other products would be impractical 
accutane which was put on the market in 1982 can cause missing 
facial features heart problems and mental retardation in babies 
born to women taking it the fda said 62 cases of birth defects 
have been reported 
but dermatologists have praised the drug as the only one on the 
market capable of curing the severe acne that causes deep scarring 
the new fda requirements are based on the recommendations of an 
advisory panel of outside experts who also recommended that the 
drug stay on the market accutane already carries explicit warnings 
that its use by pregnant women carries a high risk of birth defects 
analysts and fda officials said that including a deformed 
infants picture with the drug was a first 
because of the controversy youre going to see a significant 
decrease in the use of the drug said karl habermas an analyst 
with sanford c bernstein inc in new york 
webb called the drug a significant but not major factor in 
swissowned la roches us sales accutane sales last year 
amounted to 60 million or 16 percent of the companys us oral 
drug sales he said 
the deformed infant picture could affect sales just as 
whenever you emphasize negatives webb said 
i think that theyre just trying to be absolutely clear that a 
certain category of patient shouldnt use it he said 
la roche spokeswoman carolyn r glynn said our only goal is 
making sure users dont get pregnant 
ms glynn and grigg said that the company and regulatory agency 
basically agreed on the proposals outlined by the fda which were 
contained in a letter dated may 19 the company is preparing a 
formal response to the letter 
one point of possible contention is the exact location of the 
photograph the fda said the picture should go with packaging but 
ms grigg said the company favors its inclusion somewhere in 
educational materials the company is developing to be provided 
to prescribing physicians 
theres not going to be a problem over that situation said 
grigg he said the agency and company already have discussed coming 
up with a final proposal and one possibility would be to put the 
photograph with the consent form

george bush made a campaign promise 
on friday to his neighbors local lobstermen wont be barred from 
the waters near his vacation home because of him 
these men and women make their livelihood pulling lobsters out 
of this bay theyve done it for years and theyre going to 
continue to do it he said 
bush here for a week of rest and strategy talks voiced concern 
over local news accounts suggesting that if he wins the presidency 
in november some of the waters of this seacoast town might be 
closed to boaters including lobstermen for security reasons 
thats absolutely absurd he told a news conference at his 
compound as a lone lobsterman plied his trade from his boat just a 
few hundred yards away 
bushs family compound comprising two homes and several smaller 
guest cottages sits on a narrow point walker point that juts 
into the atlantic ocean 
on the inland side a dozen crab pots dot the small cove between 
the bush compound and the shore all within a stones throw 
the shoreline and the road leading into the compound are heavily 
guarded but local lobstermen are currently permitted to work the 
waters adjacent to bushs property 
i dont want to inconvenience our neighbors said bush who 
said he had been coming to the retreat for every summer of the 63 
years of his life except one 1944 when he was at war 
these people have been fishing in these waters wartime or not 
wartime and i cant ever remember any different he said 
the issue of whether the secret service would declare the waters 
around the bush compound offlimits if he is elected has been the 
subject of much recent local speculation bush said he wanted to 
put the issue to rest 
i dont want to convolute the life of people who earn their 
livings here all yearround bush said 
if it became a choice between whether these lobstermen can 
fish in this bay or i would stop coming to this place i love i 
would not come here he said and it would break my heart 
but its not going to come to that he added

a soviet economist said friday that mikhail s 
gorbachev has mishandled his antidrunkenness campaign by 
emphasizing police methods instead of taking the longrange view of 
offering consumers a better choice of goods 
nikolai shmelev said the soviet leaders campaign has driven 
drinking underground encouraged moonshiners and deprived the 
government of liquor sales revenue 
shmelev whose stinging criticisms of the soviet economy in the 
literary journal novy mir have caused a wave of controversy spoke 
to reporters at the foreign ministry and expanded on comments he 
made in a recent article 
he said the campaign got drunks off the streets and out of the 
workplace 
but he added unfortunately i am afraid nothing has changed 
the structure of consumption has changed instead of 
stateproduced spirits they drink moonshine they sometimes drink 
chemicals he said 
some soviets turned to drinking hair tonic cologne and rubbing 
alcohol in a desperate search for spirits 
shmelev said a more effective but longterm way to solve the 
drinking problem is to improve consumer supplies so a man could 
use his ruble to buy a bottle of vodka or a good shirt 
soviet consumer goods are of notoriously poor quality and in 
short supply gorbachev has promised to improve the lives of 
soviets by improving the quantity and quality of food and consumer 
goods 
gorbachevs antialcohol campaign his first major initiative 
after taking power in march 1985 included raising the drinking 
age shortening the hours of liquor stores and cutting liquor 
production 
he and other officials credited the campaign with helping 
increase the life expectancy for soviet men in the past two years 
the kremlin for years did not publish life expectancy figures 
presumably because they were embarrassing 
complaints have been voiced in the soviet press however that 
too many liquor stores have closed forcing people who want to buy 
an occasional bottle of wine or vodka to stand in line for hours 
shmelev said alcoholism will be a problem for a number of 
generations for a number of decades 
an economist close to gorbachev abel aganbegyan told reporters 
the antialcohol campaign achieved very impressive results in 
cutting liquor sales 
but he added now moonshine is consumed in great quantities 
even greater than before the antialcohol campaign was launched 
aganbegyan said the effort to convince people not to drink was 
poorly handled and that sobriety societies set up across the 
soviet union had not been effective

japans main opposition party fired the editor of 
its newspaper friday over an article saying the united states 
japan south korea and bahrain were involved in the bombing of a 
korean jetliner last year 
the action was taken after south korea expressed anger over the 
article which quoted former south korean prime minister kim 
chungyul as saying the governments of those countries were behind 
the planes disappearance 
the korean air lines boeing 707 vanished off the coast of burma 
in november with 115 people aboard 
socialist party general secretary tsuruo yamaguchi on thursday 
announced plans to retract the article and publish an apology on 
the front page of the papers next edition due out may 31 
the article which appeared in the partys semiweekly shakai 
shimpo on tuesday quoted kim as saying the plot was carried out to 
ensure the election in december of roh taewoo as south koreas 
president 
following a party executive meeting this morning the editor 
of the paper has been removed and the reporter who wrote the 
article has been warned said a party spokesman who commented on 
condition of anonymity 
a member of the papers editorial staff who spoke on condition 
he not be further identified refused to say why the report had not 
been more closely scrutinized prior to publication he said that 
since the newspaper has no correspondents in korea there may 
have been limitations in translation 
issei inoue head of the partys international division was 
called to the foreign ministry on friday to explain the incident 
after the south korean government issued a formal protest late 
thursday night the spokesman said 
the honor of the korean people has been seriously harmed by 
the article said south korean embassy minister park ryun in a 
statement delivered to the japanese government thursday afternoon 
south korea has accused communist north korea of blowing up the 
plane in an effort to disrupt the olympic games in seoul north 
korea has been demanding to be a cohost of the games but denied 
involvement in the plane incident 
a young woman who was a passenger on an early part of the flight 
was arrested and said she was an agent trained in north korea and 
had planted a bomb on the plane 
south korea disagrees with the japanese socialist partys 
friendly stance toward north korea 
the party in turn has refused to recognize a 1965 bilateral 
agreement normalizing japans relations with the southern half of 
the korean peninsula though japan has no formal diplomatic ties 
with the north the socialists and north korea maintain good 
relations 
in a major policy shift last february however the party lifted 
a longstanding ban on travel to south korea by party officials in 
recognition of seouls advancement toward democratization

economists for the nations top businesses 
said friday they had boosted their growth forecasts for 1988 but 
they still expect high interest rates to push the country into a 
recession sometime next year 
the latest survey of the national association of business 
economists showed a substantial upward revision in growth estimates 
for this year compared with a survey done three months ago 
the economists who advise some of the countrys largest 
corporations said they were looking for the gross national product 
to expand 29 percent this year which would match the performance 
turned in during 1986 and 1987 
three months ago the economists forecast a much slower 22 
percent gnp increase in 1988 
the survey was taken in early may before the government released 
its revised estimate of economic growth for the first quarter on 
thursday the commerce department said the gnp rose at a robust 
annual rate of 39 percent from january through march 
kathleen cooper chief economist of the security pacific 
national bank in los angeles said if the survey were taken now 
most economists would boost growth estimates even higher 
some analysts are predicting the economy could grow at a 4 
percent rate this year which would be the fastest growth since 
1984 
in the survey the economists said the reason for the increased 
optimism was a belief that the countrys trade deficit would show 
more improvement because of higherthanexpected growth in us 
exports 
the merchandise trade deficit which hit a record 171 billion 
last year was predicted to shrink to 150 billion this year a 
drop of 12 percent this is only slightly less optimistic than the 
reagan administrations projection that the trade deficit will 
decline by 15 percent this year 
the economists predicted the boom in us export sales would 
help push industrial production up a strong 45 percent this year 
however the economists expressed concerns that the rapid growth 
in foreign demand coupled with continued high consumer spending in 
this country would contribute to inflationary pressures and prompt 
the federal reserve to step in with higher interest rates to cool 
off the economy 
the fed already has tightened credit conditions twice in the 
past two months driving up a variety of interest rates including 
the prime rate and mortgage rates 
fixedrate mortgages rose to 1058 percent this past week the 
highest level since the first of the year the federal home loan 
mortgage corp reported friday 
we see inflation coming it at 5 percent this year that will 
cause the fed to tighten up and push interest rates up ms 
cooper said higher interest rates are normally the way we get 
into recessions in this country 
the survey found that a majority of the economists 578 
percent believed the lengthy economic expansion now in its sixth 
year will end with a recession beginning in 1989 
on other issues the survey of 58 business economists who 
regularly make forecasts for their own companies found 
consumer prices will rise by 43 percent in 1988 but the 
inflation rate will jump to 5 percent in 1989 
the federal budget deficit which fell to 1489 billion in the 
1987 fiscal year will edge up slightly to 155 billion in the 
current fiscal year which ends sept 30 
corporate profits will surge by 91 percent this year even 
better than the 87 percent profit increase of 1987

the government has begun a safety 
investigation into alleged failures in electrically powered front 
seats in 1985 and 1986 chrysler plymouth and dodge automobiles 
the transportation department said friday 
the investigation by the national highway traffic safety 
administration was prompted by 132 complaints about the operation 
of the automatic seats in the chrysler lebaron laser and new 
yorker dodge 600 daytona and lancer and plymouth caravelle 
the government said the complaints included seven accidents 
resulting in three injuries in all 195000 chrysler cars have 
seats that potentially could fail nhtsa said 
the agency said a failure in the seat could cause a reduction in 
seat strength and increase the likelihood of injury in a 
rearimpact crash or cause the seat to recline rearward resulting 
in a driver losing control of the car 
nhtsa said chrysler corp is aware of the two failure modes 
and has taken action to correct them but has not conducted a 
safety recall 
the automaker has strengthened the frame of the power seat and 
seat adjuster in later model cars the agency said

together 
tim peterson a fifthgrade teacher at wall school and kamela 
britvec who teaches first grade tied the knot in her homeroom as 
their students read poetry and sang during the ceremony 
the pair met last spring during a school outing shortly after 
peterson joined the faculty 
we hear kids talk about divorce and bad relationships and we 
wanted to show them how a good relationship develops over time 
said britvec 25 
peterson 30 said his students thought he was joking when he 
told them the wedding would be at school during school hours 
the kids have been in on this relationship since day one 
peterson said after the wedding so much so that some of the 
students took credit for the marriage the first for both the bride 
and groom 
if it wasnt for us they wouldnt even be together said 
richard potts 11 one of petersons fifthgraders we told him 
how to ask her out he was too scared 
the students helped decorate the classroom and halls of the 
475pupil school in this small town near the indiana border with 
multicolored streamers paper flowers wedding bells and 
congratulatory signs 
during the wedding mrs petersons firstgraders read a poem 
they had written that included the verse we feel good about 
love 
after the ceremony which was performed by mayor donald 
easterday the children gave the petersons a quilt with panels on 
which they had drawn pictures 
some first graders had a few qualms about the proceedings 
this is mushy said 7yearold raymond whitehead but he 
brightened up and added ill bet the cake will be good 
the kids got a break from afternoon classes for the wedding but 
principal earl arend said he was sure their education didnt suffer 
whos to say where children learn the most from a math book 
or from some real life experience life a marriage ceremony he 
said 
the couple said their students were the first to know of their 
april 1 engagement and the students interest in this classroom 
romance doesnt look like stopping with the wedding 
theyre already asking when well have a baby peterson

a black cuban refugee jailed more than two years on 
a murder charge despite two witnesses testimony that the killer 
was white has been released ending an ordeal he said was not 
supposed to happen in this country 
at one point prosecutors had said they would seek the death 
penalty for rigoberto alberja 32 indicted for firstdegree murder 
in the 1982 shooting of a patron at an allapattah bar during a 
holdup 
alberja was arrested in january 1986 on the tip of a police 
informant even though the bars two owners said the killer was 
white and had straight hair 
alberja always maintained his innocence and refused offers to 
plea bargain earlier this month the state finally conceded it 
could not prove its case and alberja was released 
its unbelievable said alberjas public defender art koch 
if all you got is two witnesses saying the guy was caucasian and 
you arrest a guy who isnt caucasian well then maybe you better 
think you got the wrong guy 
alberja said thursday he had never been arrested before the 
murder case and was stunned by the treatment he got from the 
united states 
it is a great injustice said alberja this happens in 
other countries but its not supposed to happen in this country 
alberja said that during his time awaiting trial in the dade 
county jail he was stabbed six times by another inmate in 
florida those accused of firstdegree murder are automatically 
jailed without bond pending trial 
prosecutor mike cornely defended his case despite the 
identification problems he said lengthy appeals over pretrial 
motions hampered his efforts 
we had other information a confidential informant and certain 
other witnesses who knew something said cornely but by the 
time the appeal was done a lot had dried up 
none of the five robbery victims at the bar could be located he 
said 
he shrugged off the the discrepancy over alberjas race at the 
time of the robbery bar owners terry taylor and edward liles 
helped sketch a picture of the suspect who they said was white 
but after the tip from the informant almost four years later 
investigators called in liles and he identified alberja from a 
photo lineup 
i dont know what liles thinking was at first said 
cornely maybe the lighting in the bar made him think the suspect 
was white but thats just a maybe 
but cornely acknowledged that liles change of testimony and a 
judges decision to throw out the photo identification made his 
case impossible 
his id alone would not fly said the prosecutor we need 
other witnesses and those witnesses disappeared

watching bullwinkle head into the 
gulf of mexico on friday brought tears to the eyes of some who 
worked on the colossal offshore drilling platform that will be 
taller than chicagos landmark sears tower 
weve worked hard for three years and an event like this can 
be somewhat emotional said gordon sterling shell offshore 
incs project manager for bullwinkle there were a few tears 
watching it go by 
after the 1368foot 50000ton bullwinkle settles on the ocean 
floor off the louisiana coast workers will install a deck and two 
drilling rigs bringing the leviathans weight to 78000 tons and 
its height to 1615 feet 
that compares to the worlds tallest building which is the 
sears tower which is about 1450 feet sterling said the 
tallest drilling platform is the 1132foot shell cognac platform 
installed off the louisiana coast in 1976 
spectators lined the ship channel at port aransas on friday to 
see the bullwinkle off and police had to direct traffic even 
lying on its side it had no trouble dwarfing everything in sight 
i made a trip up from south padre island to watch bullwinkle 
go out sam mcspadden said i used to live in this town and 
ive followed its progress since its inception 
sterling has been in charge of the bullwinkle project during 
three years of construction at the ingleside yard of gulf marine 
fabricators which shell contracted for construction 
transportation and installation 
we wish we were building another one right now wish we had 
another one to start just as big as it or bigger gulf marine 
vice president myron j rodrigue said after watching nine tugboats 
pull the barge carrying the huge steel drilling jacket through the 
corpus christi ship channel 
at the projects peak 700 people were employed in building the 
structure at ingleside rodrigue said shell estimates the total 
cost of the bullwinkle project at 500 million including 
construction installation and related expenses the company would 
not specify how much the structure itself cost 
the bullwinkle with a base measuring 4 acres has been a 
fixture on the horizon during its development visible for several 
miles on the flat coastal plain in the corpus christi area 
traffic on the gulf intracoastal waterway was diverted at the 
beginning of may to prepare for loading the platform onto a 
specially built barge that measures 853 feet long 207 feet wide 
and 49 feet deep 
it is expected to take about three days to pull the structure 
380 miles to its destination about 150 miles southwest of new 
orleans 
the base will be flooded to bring the drilling jacket to rest in 
1353 feet of water in shells green canyon lease with 
installation expected to take about three months 
twentyeight pilings for bullwinkle will be driven 400 feet into 
the sea floor and secured with cement bullwinkle is designed to 
withstand at least a 72foot hurricane wave with the ability to 
sway more than 6 feet without stress damage 
shell estimates that production will begin in the first quarter 
of 1989 and will eventually put out 50000 barrels of oil and 90 
million cubic feet of natural gas per day 
the bullwinkle project was conceived nearly five years ago when 
oil was well above 20 a barrel sterling said 
even today at 15 its a profitable venture he said but 
added he will not brag until bullwinkle is in place and producing 
bullwinkle was a code name given to the project when shell

the senate on friday ratified 935 a treaty 
to abolish mediumrange nuclear missiles enabling president reagan 
to present the pact to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at their 
moscow summit next week 
it was the first major ussoviet arms control accord ratified 
by the senate since 1972 
leading up to the ratification vote the senate rejected four 
minor amendments offered by republicans that brought to 14 the 
number of amendments proposed by gop conservatives and rejected 
during two weeks of floor consideration of the treaty 
the senates consent to ratification which required a twothird 
majority had long been assured because only a handful of 
conservatives opposed the pact 
senators voting against the treaty were republicans jesse helms 
of north carolina steve symms of idaho gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire and malcolm wallop of wyoming and democrat ernest 
hollings of south carolina 
sens joseph biden ddel and john glenn dohio did not vote 
spectators crowded into galleries overlooking the senate floor 
gave a standing ovation after the vote tally was announced 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva and gop leader bob 
dole rkan quickly informed reagan of the outcome in a telephone 
call to helsinki finland where the president was resting in 
advance of the summit 
the two leaders accepted reagans invitation to come to moscow 
next tuesday to witness the exchange of treaty documents the white 
house said presidential chief of staff howard baker would fly to 
moscow to deliver the us ratification materials sunday 
in a statement issued by the white house the president said he 
was very pleased by the vote which clearly shows support for 
our arms reduction objectives 
he added however i continue to have concerns about the 
constitutionality of some provisions of the resolution of 
ratification particularly those dealing with interpretation and i 
will communicate with the senate on these matters in due course 
byrd told reagan bless your heart were just delighted that 
were going to send you a treaty and it was almost a unanimous vote 
well have a little blue ribbon tied around it 
dole told the president we are very pleased to be able to 
give you this ratification in advance of your stepping on soviet 
territory in moscow 
reagan and gorbachev signed the pact dec 8 at their summit 
meeting in washington and the administration had pushed for senate 
action before the moscow summit 
administration officials also waged a successful fight to win 
senate approval without socalled killer amendments that would 
have required ussoviet negotiations to be reopened 
conservative republican critics mounted several attacks but all 
their attempts were easily turned back 
the only major change was a democraticbacked amendment to the 
ratification resolution barring future administrations from 
changing the us interpretation of the treaty without prior senate 
approval that arose from a fight with reagan over the 
antiballistic missile treaty the last arms pact to win senate 
ratification 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty provides for 
the elimination within three years of all mediumrange missiles 
with a range of 300 miles to 3400 miles the soviets would destroy 
1752 missiles while the united states would eliminate 867 
including both deployed and nondeployed weapons 
the inf pact is the first in the 40year history of ussoviet 
nuclear arms control to require the actual destruction of weapons 
other accords simply slowed the buildup of each sides vast nuclear 
arsenals 
in addition the treaty includes the most intrusive and 
stringent verification procedures in arms control history the key 
verification feature provides onsite inspection both on a regular 
basis and through challenges by each side 
elimination of the mediumrange missiles still will leave 
thousands of nuclear weapons in europe the united states has about 
4300 shortrange atomic weapons of various kinds in western 
europe while great britain and france have their own nuclear 
arsenals 
while the pact will only provide for reductions of about 3 
percent in each sides arsenal administration and congressional 
supporters say they hope it will be a blueprint for a more 
farreaching treaty reducing longrange weapons 
that proposed pact known as the strategic arms reduction treaty 
start is the subject of ongoing ussoviet negotiations and is 
likely to be a key topic at the reagangorbachev summit 
both sides are still far apart on the proposed start treaty and 
one of the main sticking point is how to verify it onsite 
inspections would have to be even more farreaching than those in 
the inf treaty 
in addition to serving as a first major step to start the inf 
treaty should also prod the 16member north atlantic treaty 
organization to improve its array of conventional weapons 
supporters argued during the congressional debate 
inf is a beginning not an end said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee 
nunn was referring to natos need to improve its conventional 
defenses the soviets and their warsaw pact allies outnumber nato 
in a variety of numerical categories of weapons including tanks 
and artillery pieces 
the inf pact was hailed as natos finest hour by secretary 
of state george p shultz a theme restated often during senate 
consideration of the accord 
shultz was referring to natos decision to go ahead with the 
1983 deployments of the new us nuclear weapons despite strong 
protests in some nato nations particularly britain and west 
germany those deployments were considered the key to the final 
agreement

striking tv and movie scriptwriters will 
resume work for more than 70 producers including makers of the 
toprated the cosby show under independent contracts approved 
by the writers union friday 
the independent contracts were approved by 86 percent of the 
2016 members of the writers guild of america who voted thursday 
night in new york and los angeles said union spokeswoman cheryl 
rhoden 
the producers bargaining group the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers dismissed the defections of the mostly 
small production companies as an insignificant episode in the 
12week strike which has forced delays in the start of the fall 
television season 
by friday noon a union list of producers who had signed 
included carseywerner co which makes cosby and the makers 
of the tonight show starring johnny carson highway to 
heaven and its garry shandlings show 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg estimated the independent 
contracts which accede to writers key pay demands cover just 1 
percent of the unions 3000 working members and none of the big 
production companies that form the backbone of the industry group 
it had virtually no impact on primetime network programs 
steinberg said of the vote 
not one alliance member is in this group steinberg said of 
the producers who had signed on they voted to put 72 writers to 
work were concerned with getting 3000 writers back to work 
many of those who signed were oneperson writerproducer 
companies and some listed make tv shows that have been cancelled 
including the smothers brothers comedy show and days and nights 
of molly dodd steinberg said 
but ms rhoden termed the defections a symbolic victory as well 
as a break in management ranks 
were very very pleased ms rhoden said the significant 
thing is that upwards of 70 companies feel they can do 
profitable business under a contract that also respects the needs 
of writers 
the threeyear contract accepts the writers key demand 
retention of the present formula for the payments known as 
residuals which writers get for reruns of onehour television 
shows 
citing the increasing difficulty in selling such shows for 
rerun the producers are seeking to link the amount of the residual 
payments to a shows success in rerun or syndication as it is 
known in the industry 
the contract also boosts residual payments for use of the 
writers work overseas and tightens requirements that writers be 
consulted about script changes made during filming the union 
contract also boosts minimum pay scales for writers 
the writers walked out march 7 and until this week only one 
bargaining session was held 
talks wednesday at the producers headquarters in los angeles 
sherman oaks district failed to make progress 
the negotiators agreed to resume formal talks tuesday under the 
guidance of a federal mediator and small groups were scheduled to 
hold preliminary discussions saturday

charged with trying to shoplift 44 in merchandise from a 
department store 
miss myerson appeared before district justice john m mcdermott 
and was released on 150 cash bail 
the 63yearold new york city resident already facing federal 
fraud and briberyrelated charges contested south williamsport 
police allegations that she tried to leave hill department store 
with six bottles of nail polish five pairs of earrings shoes and 
flashlight batteries in her purse and shopping bag 
i was leaving the store to lock my car and come back and pay 
for the merchandise she told the magistrate 
she said she would pay her fine and costs under protest 
through the mail if court documents affirm her contention that 
this is her first such offense the maximum penalty according to 
the court would be a 300 fine 
if true its extraordinarily sad that this could have 
occurred new york city mayor edward i koch said of the charge 
miss myerson was his campaign manager in 1977 when koch was first 
elected mayor 
the new york daily news earlier this month quoted unidentified 
sources and records as saying miss myerson was charged in 1970 with 
shoplifting from a london department store the newspaper said she 
left london without taking care of the charge and paid a fine of no 
more than 100 in 1987 to end the case

scheduled to go on trial sept 14

a pair of top soviet economists on friday said 
progressive taxes on small businesses are an example of 
bureaucratic meddling that will discourage growth of consumer goods 
and services 
abel aganbegyan an economist close to soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev told reporters the progressive taxes as high as 90 
percent were adopted behind closed doors by the finance 
ministry 
some provisions are faulty they didnt know much about 
progressive taxation he said 
gorbachev has said the cooperatives employeeowned small 
businesses are a key element of his plans to improve the supply 
of goods and services to consumers who face widespread shortages 
in the staterun economy 
the supreme soviet the countrys nominal parliament on 
thursday passed a law expanding the rights of the cooperatives to 
compete with the inefficient staterun economy 
and in a rare move the body also expanded the rights of local 
government to give tax breaks to preferred kinds of cooperatives 
and directed that the progressive tax structure decreed april 1 by 
the finance ministry be rewritten 
the supreme soviet normally only rubber stamps legislation that 
already has been approved by the communist party the dominant 
force in soviet society 
nikolai shmelev an economist with the soviet unions 
usacanada institute said the tax rates decreed by the finance 
ministry apparently will remain in effect until they can be 
rewritten 
tax rates for workers at cooperatives are 27 percent on a 
monthly income of 1600 and 535 percent on an income of 3200 
the government has not said what income would be affected by the 
maximum 90 percent tax 
the average industrial worker earns about 320 a month workers 
in the state sector pay a flat 13 percent tax if they earn more 
than 480 a month 
i think this law on progressive taxation on cooperatives is 
very bad it puts obstacles in the way of development of 
cooperatives shmelev said 
he said the debate in the supreme soviet was an encouraging sign 
of life in that body 
aganbegyan said the tax rates probably would be on the books for 
a year or more before they could be amended 
eventually he said a uniform progressive tax rate should be 
developed for those who work in cooperatives and those who for 
staterun enterprises 
the law approved thursday by the supreme soviet legally puts 
cooperatives on an equal footing with staterun enterprises it 
ensures that cooperative property may not be seized by the state 
allows cooperatives to own buildings and other property not 
including land and them to conduct business with overseas 
companies and earn hard currency

an explosion in a garbage 
truck friday night injured the driver and set the vehicle afire 
police reported 
police spokesman pierre louw said the explosion occurred while a 
worker was loading a garbage bin into the back of the truck in 
downtown johannesburg he said the worker was not hurt but the 
driver suffered minor injuries to his face and one arm 
louw said police had not determined the cause but suspected it 
was a limpet mine an explosive device that clings to other objects 
there was no claim of responsibility police blame nearly all 
explosions the african national congress the main guerrilla group 
fighting white domination 
the anc based in lusaka zambia seldom confirms or denies 
involvement in specific attacks but acknowledges using bombs in its 
campaign against the government 
more than 70 bombings have been reported in south africa since a 
nationwide state of emergency was declared june 12 1986 to thwart 
an uprising in black townships 
two bombs went off thursday in pretoria wounding four white 
women the explosions coincided with the 40th anniversary of rule 
by the national party architect of the apartheid policy that 
preserves power for the 5 million whites and denies a voice in 
national affairs to the 26 million blacks

the attorney for a woman who contracted aids 
through a 1983 blood transfusion told a jury friday that the blood 
bank failed to screen donors properly and the doctors who saw her 
later treated her like a medical yoyo 
susie quintana 50 of dolores and her husband chris 53 are 
suing united blood services whose blood bank in albuquerque nm 
supplied the contaminated plasma their former family doctor 
edward g merritt and dr donald kearns a denver infectious 
disease expert who first tested mrs quintana for exposure to the 
virus that causes aids 
lawyers have said the case may be the first case in the nation 
in which a jury will decide an aids victims claim against a blood 
bank in a 1986 california case a jury was chosen but the lawsuit 
was settled out of court before the trial ended 
after closing arguments wind up district judge john w coughlin 
said he would allow the sixmember jury to decide whether to 
recess for the holiday weekend or begin deliberations saturday the 
trial began three weeks ago 
mrs quintanas attorney maureen reidy witt said ubs and the 
doctors were uninformed and insensitive to the physical and 
emotional needs of their patient 
ubs attorney douglas irish said the jury must judge the 
defendants on the acceptable standards of care at the time quintana 
received the transfusion arguing that a test to detect aids virus 
in donated blood did not exist in 1983 
he cautioned the jury that ubs actions cannot be judged by 
you using wisdom gained from hindsight 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a disease that attacks 
the bodys immune system it is transmitted through sexual contact 
or contact with an infected persons blood or bodily fluids 
mrs quintana received the deadly virus in a 1983 blood 
transfusion at southwest memorial hospital in cortez during 
treatment for an accidental selfinflicted gunshot wound 
the other two defendants the two doctors were accused of 
failing to properly diagnose or counsel her later 
susie was lonely abandoned and scared and was a medical yoyo 
betwen dr merritt and dr kearns who said you do have it you 
dont have it you do have it witt said 
that was in the spring of 1986 when they knew she had two 
positive test results 
witt said the doctors were also negligent in failing to explain 
to the couple what precautions they should have taken to prevent 
transmission of the disease although the couple testified they had 
sexual relations following the tests chris quintana has tested 
negative for the aids virus 
though ubs argued that the aids blood test became available only 
in 1985 witt said the federal centers for disease control in 
atlanta said in december 1982 that aids transmission was linked to 
homosexual and bisexual men and to blood transfusions 
the blood bank had options to screen donors such as direct 
questioning or physical examinations witt argued united blood 
services chose d none of the above he said 
the lawsuit didnt specify the amount of damages sought but 
witt suggested the jury award damages of mroe than 13 million 
irish said in closing arguments that the defendants were 
sympathetic and regret that she contracted aids from the 
transfusion 
but the plaintiffs are not asking for our sympathy irish 
said they are here to ask you to move a bag of money maybe 13 
million maybe more from this table to that table 
irish said the only person who can be blamed is the donor who 
has admitted to carrying the aids virus 
we are not liable for that mans conduct irish said

the government of afghanistan has 
pardoned imprisoned french journalist alain guillo stateowned 
radio kabul said friday 
in paris the french communist party newspaper lhumanite said 
guillo would be freed saturday 
guillo a freelancer was arrested while filming the afghan war 
in northern afghanistan last september he was convicted in january 
of spying and sentenced to 10 years in prison 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad quoted afghan president 
najib as saying guillo was pardoned in view of the old friendship 
between france and afghanistan 
he said it was also in view of the geneva accords signed april 
14 to withdraw more than 100000 soviet troops from afghanistan 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 and helped 
the marxist government fight usbacked moslem rebels 
afghanistan neighboring pakistan the united states and the soviet 
union signed the geneva accords 
najib announced the pardon after gilbert perol secretary 
general of the french external affairs ministry met with najib 
the newscast said perol delivered a personal message from french 
president francois mitterrand it said 
eric fornier spokesman for the french embassy in islamabad 
could not confirm the reports that guillo would be freed saturday 
certainly it will be in the next two to three days fornier 
said 
guillo has shared a prison cell in kabul with italian journalist 
fausto biloslavo who is serving a similar sentence but there was 
no word on whether biloslavo would be released 
western diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they expected biloslavos release soon because najib is trying 
to polish his governments image during the soviet troop withdrawal 
the kabul correspondent for lhumanite francis cremieux said 
guillo would fly out of kabul saturday afternoon and could arrive 
in paris early sunday cremieux who had met with aides to the 
president reported earlier this week that guillo would be freed 
soon 
french journalists met with guillo on may 14 at the 
poulecharki prison near kabul they quoted him as saying then 
that he would never ask for a pardon because he was innocent of the 
spy charges and considered himself a hostage not a prisoner

the army has decided to accelerate plans to 
shield a key control unit in the uh60 blackhawk helicopter against 
radio wave interference after a test incident earlier this month in 
europe a spokesman said friday 
the may 11 incident in which a blackhawk flying near a huge 
antenna farm banked into a righthand turn for five seconds without 
any pilot commands also has prompted the army to instruct its 
pilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations in 
west germany 
although the may 11 incident has raised new concerns about the 
effects of socalled electromagnetic interference on the blackhawk 
extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealing 
with a nuisance problem and not a phenomenon that affects 
flight safety said maj phil soucy an army spokesman 
we certainly are not going to ground the fleet because 
theres no reason to do so soucy added 
but soucy said the army intends to accelerate its plans to add 
shielding to the electronic controls on the crafts hydraulic 
control system because of the test results the service already had 
opened talks with the helicopters manufacturer sikorsky aircraft 
on shielding a number of electronic components because our pilots 
shouldnt have to worry about nuisance signal interference soucy 
said 
last november knightridder newspapers reported investigators 
were convinced radio wave interference had caused five blackhawk 
accidents since 1982 killing 22 servicemen 
radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopters wiring 
and electrical components and generate false commands that can 
range from simply causing the crafts warning lights to flash to 
sending it into a fatal dive the report said 
the army and sikorsky a subsidiary of the united technologies 
corp adamantly disputed that report saying there was no evidence 
electromagnetic interference had caused any crashes 
the service had acknowledged earlier that radio wave 
interference could cause uncommanded control inputs moving the 
helicopters horizontal stabilator slightly but not to the extent 
of posing a flight safety hazard there is a switch in the cockpit 
that allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator the 
army says 
last month a blackhawk operating near a large array of 
highintensity antennas in west germany experienced some unusual 
blinking lights and alarm horns soucy said the army then 
attempted to replicate that incident with special instruments and 
test pilots 
on may 11 during a test the aircraft turned to the right on 
its own for about five seconds while flying near the antenna 
farm soucy said we believe the hydraulic logic module inside 
the blackhawk was being affected 
the spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter was 
flying to the antenna farm but said it was transmitting with a 
combined power in excess of 400 million watts of power 
while the test suggests that large levels of electromagnetic 
interference actually can affect the controls of the blackhawk 
the effect is very brief and doesnt pose a threat of losing 
control of the copter soucy said 
the blackhawk is a twinengine singlerotor helicopter that is 
replacing the aging uh1 huey copters of the vietnam era as the 
armys primary air assault and air cavalry craft it was introduced 
in april 1981 
the army currently has more than 900 blackhawks in its inventory 
and plans to buy about 1700 of the choppers each craft costs 
roughly 6 million

a plo official said friday the arab 
nations are not giving palestinians the political and financial 
support they need to continue the 6monthold uprising in the 
israelioccupied territories 
bassam abu sharif said the guerrilla movement will demand clear 
stands on the palestinian issue from all governments during the 
arab summit that begins june 7 in algerias capital 
the algiers summit will be the purgatory through which 
everyone will have to pass said abu sharif media advister to 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization 
he made the comments in an article in the londonbased 
newsletter mideast mirror a copy was telexed to the associated 
press in bahrain 
the question that will be asked both in private and in public 
will be who among you supports the establishment of a palestinian 
state and who opposes it he said there will be no room for 
double talk or halfbaked positions 
all arab governments express public support for creation of a 
palestinian state but hardliners often accuse prowestern 
moderates of avoiding conflict with us middle east policy 
the american plan promoted in trips to the region by secretary 
of state george p shultz proposes limited selfrule for the 15 
million palestinians of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
as of friday 198 palestinians and two israelis had died in 
violence in the occupied territories since the unrest began dec 8 
abu sharif claimed the summit had been delayed because of a 
tug of war behind the scenes between moderates and hardliners 
over the palestinian issue 
he said president chadli bendjedid of algeria took the 
initiative to call for the summit because of a justified belief 
that arab officialdom was guilty of dereliction of duty toward the

democratic frontrunner michael dukakis will try 
to resolve his differences with jesse jackson before the partys 
july nominating convention aides say but will not give in to 
jacksons demands for cuts in defense spending and higher taxes on 
the wealthy 
dukakis aides careful not to criticize the civil rights leader 
point out that dukakis will likely secure the nomination when the 
primary season concludes on june 7 and thus will be negotiating 
with jackson from a position of strength they said dukakis will 
not make concessions that could hurt his chances against certain 
republican nominee george bush 
our negotiating position will be very strong dukakis 
spokesman leslie dach said in an interview thursday our ultimate 
goal is to resolve our differences as much as we can but were not 
going to negotiate our basic stands youre not going to see any 
kind of fundamental shifts 
on the stump jackson contends he is swaying dukakis he is 
adjusting to a new agenda jackson told a california rally on 
thursday 
but in reality dukakis has rejected many jackson proposals 
including his calls for defense cuts and higher taxes for the 
wealthy and large corporations 
dukakis aides also say a national health insurance proposal 
espoused by jackson is far more expensive than an employerfunded 
program backed by dukakis who also has rejected jacksons call for 
spending 25 billion to improve education programs we simply 
dont feel there is the money there to spend said dukakis issues 
adviser tom herman 
for now dukakis aides say they will confine the public debate 
over dukakisjackson differences to public statements of the 
candidates and ongoing discussions over the convention platform 
we hope they will reach as many agreements as they can and 
when that process is further along it will be time to go back see 
where our differences are dach said were very comfortable 
that we will be at the convention with a very clear working 
majority 
while the dukakis campaign hopes to avoid public feuding or a 
fallout with jackson it is at the same time sending subtle signals 
to jackson and expanding its outreach to black voters in case 
jackson refuses to support dukakis up to 100 black dukakis 
supporters from across the country are scheduled to meet in boston 
on monday to discuss a fall strategy 
i hope everybody has the same sense heading into this 
convention dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said when 
asked about potential conflicts with jackson there is a real 
sense that we democrats can win bush has real vulnerabilities 
we democrats if we dont shoot ourselves in the foot can win 
and i dont think there is anybody in our party who wants to wake 
up the day after the election and have it said that if it wasnt 
for him we would have won 
estrich met with jackson convention manager ron brown this week 
and speaks frequently with her counterpart in the jackson campaign 
gerald austin she refuses to discuss the substance of the talks 
dukakis convention manager marcia hale also has scheduled 
meetings with brown and the candidates themselves met privately 
wednesday following a debate in california 
would i like to see a peaceful convention yes hale said 
but there are lots of negotiations that need to take place 
brown in a telephone interview friday said there might be 
some items that compromise cannot be found on but im not prepared 
to say what our priority issues will be there have not been 
any substantive conversations on platform issues 
he disputed the dukakis aides boast about negotiating strength 
we dont expect that anyone will have a nominating majority of 
the delegates when we go into the convention brown said despite 
that position it appears very likely dukakis will have the 2081 
delegates needed for nomination 
dukakis aides insist their convention planning is just beginning 
but say jackson will have a major role the dukakis camp also is 
expected to seek to appease jackson by agreeing to a strong 
statement denouncing apartheid in south africa and supporting 
sanctions against the country although it is unclear whether 
dukakis wants such a statement as part of the platform or whether 
he will agree with jacksons demand that south africa be designated 
a terrorist state 
there are significant differences and they represent real 
policy disagreements dach said but they trust each other and 
they share a common goal we want his support its obviously 
critical support

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis said friday the reagan administration cant say 
no to noriega and he said the cia once was paying off 
panamas military leader to the tune of 200000 a year 
weve been paying that guy what we pay the president of the 
united states dukakis said 
you cant be serious about waging a real war against drugs 
when we have an administration that cant say no to noriega he 
said referring to gen manuel noriega who is under us 
indictment on drug charges 
the massachusetts governor hammered away at the issue of drugs 
and us foreign policy as he campaigned across the southwest on a 
trip designed to close out the democratic primary season on a 
winning note and begin pointing the party toward the fall campaign 
new mexico holds its primary on june 7 and dukakis is expected 
to win enough democratic national convention delegates here and in 
primaries the same day in california montana and new jersey to 
clinch the partys nomination over jesse jackson 
jackson too was campaigning in new mexico on friday and the 
two democrats met briefly at the albuquerque airport they emerged 
smiling from a private session that lasted about five minutes 
aides would not discuss what they had said 
from new mexico where he addressed a meeting of democratic 
women and then spoke before a sundrenched outdoor rally dukakis 
headed for texas where he attended a barbeque with the state 
democratic hierarchy in a continuation of the attempt to pull the 
party together at the end of the long nominating campaign 
dukakis won the texas primary but with less than 50 percent of 
the vote in a multiplecandidate race and without broad backing 
from party leaders 
on friday in new mexico the massachusetts governor noted that 
polls show him leading vice president george bush the 
allbutcertain republican nominee and said democrats have the 
best chance to win the presidency in years 
ive never seen our party so united he said ive never 
seen our party so together 
even so the evercautious dukakis cautioned one audience to 
guard against overconfidence noting that he once was defeated for 
reelection in massachusetts after holding a 50point lead in the 
polls 
his comments about noriega represented a continuation of 
dukakis attack against the reagan administrations handling of 
negotiations with the panamanian leader 
this is an administration that cant say no to drugs and drug 
peddlers funneling aid to the contras and convicted drug dealers 
that are doing time in federal penitentiaries the cia links with 
drug trafficking and drug profiteering in the united states of 
america dukakis said 
he said either president reagan bush or somebody in this 
administration should provide an explanation of alleged cia ties 
to the panamanian 
its been paying off noriega 200000 a year weve been 
paying that guy what we pay the president of the united states 
he said the administration should explain publicly who was 
doing business with noriega and why we were doing business with 
noriega 
dukakis said the 200000 figure emerged from congressional 
hearings into noriegas alleged links with the cia

gen manuel antonio noriega on friday 
blamed us ambassador arthur davis and the state departments 
elliott abrams for the breakdown in recent talks on the generals 
political future 
noriega who as head of the armed forces is the de facto leader 
of panama also said he held the reagan administration responsible 
for his personal safety 
he told a womens convention i place responsibility for the 
life of manuel antonio noriega with the establishment of the united 
states i hold the establishment responsible for the life of this 
son of god 
the united states has been trying to force noriega to leave as 
head of panamas 15000member defense forces since he was indicted 
by us grand juries in florida in february as a major drug 
trafficker and moneylaunderer 
on wednesday us officials announced that their talks with 
panama to resolve the struggle over noriegas leadership had fallen 
apart secretary of state george p shultz blamed the collapse on 
noriega 
the general did not elaborate on his charges friday that davis 
and abrams the assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs were responsible for the breakdown of the talks 
but he called for foreign forces to leave panama and for the 
united states to leave panama in peace sirs for gods sake 
leave it in peace 
besides the panama canal the united states also has its 
southern command in panama with overall responsibility for us 
military operations in a wide swath of latin america about 10000 
us troops with about 20000 military dependents are in panama 
panamas foreign minister jorge eduardo ritter said friday 
panamas relations with the united states are practically 
nonexistent 
ritter said relations were bad because the united states 
maintains recognition of a government that doesnt exist 
washington recognizes eric arturo delvalle as panamas legal 
president even though he was ousted in february after he tried to 
fire noriega as chief of defense forces noriega then installed 
manuel solis palma as president and delvalle has been in hiding 
ever since 
delvalle said friday he warned the united states in vain against 
goitalone tactics in talks with noriega he also predicted 
violence if noriega doesnt leave 
delvalle said other latin american democracies offered to help 
and that they and the panamanian opposition should have had a role 
he met a small number of correspondents including associated 
press correspondent joseph b frazier at a location they agreed 
not to disclose and told them 
i have always thought that the talks were a ploy to delay 
matters to give noriega time to strengthen his inner circle 
within the defense forces and at the end yes to ridicule 
president reagan and the united states i dont think noriega 
was sincere and i told the reagan administration that what 
happened would happen that wasnt very difficult i told them 
about three weeks ago he added 
foreign minister ritter spoke at a news conference before 
leaving for cuba to attend a conference of nonaligned nations 
ritter said he would use the havana meeting to denounce what he 
called aggression by the united states against panama 
he also said the noriega discussions with the united states were 
informal and did not involve the foreign ministry 
but he added i want to reiterate to you that the reason those 
conversations didnt produce any result was the imposition by one 
of the sides thats what finished off the conversations 
he also said the government was evaluating damage to the 
panamanian economy as a result of us sanctions imposed in an 
effort to force noriega from power he said it was looking into 
whether there is a basis for filing suit in the international court 
of justice in netherlands a ruling in such a suit however would 
be put into effect only if both parties agreed 
washington wants the general to leave the country and delvalle 
to return as president in exchange the united states would lift 
economic sanctions and possibly drop the drug charges 
noriega also blamed washington on thursday for the talks 
collapsing 
the world must know that the conversation sustained with 
president reagans envoy broke down when he presented us with an 
ultimatum in which panama had to accept immediately his last 
offer he told a packed session of the national assembly 
asked then whether his resignation had been discussed noriega 
replied the commander doesnt abandon his ship in stormy 
weather

deposed president eric arturo 
delvalle said from hiding on friday that he warned the united 
states in vain against goitalone tactics in talks with gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
he also predicted violence if noriega doesnt leave 
delvalle said other latin american democracies offered to help 
and that they and the panamanian opposition should have had a role 
he has been in hiding since his ouster in late february he met 
with a few correspondents friday morning at a location the 
journalists agreed not to disclose 
on wednesday us officials announced that their talks with 
panama to resolve the struggle over noriegas leadership had fallen 
apart secretary of state george p shultz blamed the collapse on 
noriega 
noriega the de facto leader of panama as head of the nations 
15000member military and police forces is under indictment in 
the united states as a drug trafficker 
i have always thought that the talks were a ploy to delay 
matters to give noriega time to strengthen his inner circle 
within the panamanian defense forces and at the end yes to 
ridicule president reagan and the united states delvalle said 
i dont think noriega was sincere and i told the reagan 
administration that what happened would happen that wasnt very 
difficult i told them about three weeks ago he said 
i am disappointed at the fact that they did not use to their 
advantage our knowledge of noriega delvalle said adding that it 
is time for the united states to let latin american nations take 
the lead a move the administration now is exploring 
delvalle was vice president and assumed power when president 
nicolas ardito barletta elected by a 1700vote edge in 1984 was 
ousted in september 1985 
delvalle was forced out by noriega last february after he tried 
to fire the general the united states still recogizes delvalle as 
president 
he said he has not left panama since being deposed and that he 
is not hiding on any military base or in any embassy 
what his priority is in any deal that may lead to noriegas 
removal from power is not clear 
arrest warrants have been out for him for two months but the 
noriega government is making no apparent serious attempt to find 
him 
asked if there were circumstances under which he might renounce 
his claim delvalle responded why should i this is one of the 
basic factors respect for the constitution by the military 
all over latin american there has been a clear loud message 
that the military is below civilian government he said 
delvalle said panamanians are not used to street violence but it 
could start if noriega remains and the economy keeps going downhill 
economic pressures are building up and he knows it delvalle 
said of noriega 
i think we will be facing violence in the near future he 
said the people of panama are getting desperate we will see 
some violent demonstrations here in the next few days or weeks 
violent street protests have occurred sporadically since last 
june but have halted in what generally is attributed to the 
militarys successful crackdown and the oppositions difficulty in 
mustering support

the north are boycotting classes to protest the presence of south 
african military bases near schools a newspaper reported friday 
the namibian a weekly paper that supports the southwest 
african peoples organization guerrilla movement known as swapo 
said the boycott had spread to 20 secondary schools and 15 primary 
schools in the territory also called namibia

representative louis peinaar refused to remove an army base next 
to the ponhofi school in the northern region of ovambo he said 
bomb shelters were being built at the school to provide protection 
in the event of guerrilla bombardments of the base 
peter kalangula chairman of the ovambo administrative council 
said the south african refusal to move bases away from ponhofi and 
a few other schools is creating hatred against the security 
forces 
south africa controls namibia in defiance of un resolutions 
calling for independence south africa says it will not grant 
independence until cuban troops withdraw from neighboring angola 
where swapo guerrillas have maintained bases during their 
22yearold bush war

experts analyzing remains found in 
a mass grave believe the bones may be almost two centuries old and 
not of world war ii nazi concentration camp victims the news 
agency ctk said friday 
the staterun agency said new evidence indicates the remains may 
have been buried in northwestern czechoslovakia under the reign of 
joseph ii who held power in the region in the late 18th century 
ctk said the emperor had ordered that corpses be reburied 
outside municipal limits to prevent disease 
the remains were found may 19 during work in a quarry near the 
town of most about 50 miles northwest of prague 
archeologists had speculated that the remains could have either 
been those of death camp inmates killed by the nazis or victims of 
allied bombing attacks 
the remains originally believed to come from the world war 
ii period have been subject to testing which showed that they 
probably come from the period of the reign of joseph ii ctk said 
the news agency did not provide sources for the report and did 
not elaborate 
but an official of the most district museum which is in charge 
of the project told the associated press the remains come from the 
time of joseph ii or the napoleonic wars 
i talked to people here who remember the end of world war ii 
and no one recalled anything like this said libuse pokorna 
she said it was impossible to immediately estimate the number of 
the dead buried in the grave 
pokorna said final results from the tests could take a month

a rebel military leader turned himself 
in to the leftist government and said friday he will try to bring 
the 400 contras formerly under his command out of the mountains 
felix garcia hernandez alias commander alfa lima 26 told 
reporters friday he had decided to quit the ussupported 
insurgency on wednesday and take advantage of the sandinista 
governments amnesty program 
alfa lima a former evangelical preacher before he took up arms 
against the government spoke to reporters accompanied by 
sandinista officials 
his acceptance of the amnesty coincided with the third round of 
highlevel peace talks in managua between the government and a 
contra delegation that included his former commanderinchief 
enrique bermudez 
we regret it bermudez said upon learning of alfa limas 
decision he was a field commander with a long record we 
consider him a war casualty 
the nicaraguan government considered alfa lima one of the most 
effective contra field commanders he had led a special military 
task force in central chontales province since 1984 
in an interview with the associated press alfa lima said his 
decision followed a series of talks with his troops and with 
sandinista army soldiers during the provisional truce that went 
into effect april 1 
we sat in this farm in chontales and we talked about how we 
nicaraguans were killing each other alfa lima said we talked 
about how we wanted peace 
the contras took up arms against the sandinistas in november 
1981 
on wednesday he and six of his men abandoned their camp in 
chontales 
we had many problems he said i had more than 400 men 
under my command since february we had trouble getting supplies 
we would ask the command in honduras for supplies and then the 
planes supposedly would come from the honduran bases but the 
commanders refused to supply us they were hoarding everything 
since the truce started 
alfa lima said he hoped to encourage more of his former contra 
troops to take advantage of the amnesty 
i am going to try to convince my men to come in there are 
many out there who do not know what they are doing or why they are 
fighting said the softspoken alfa lima still wearing his 
camouflage uniform 
many of them are people separated from society they say they 
fight for democracy for freedom because they were told that but 
they dont really know he said 
i am going to show them that there are guarantees he added 
under the program the government enacted in 1985 rebels may lay 
down their arms and return to normal life in nicaragua without fear 
of reprisal 
alfa lima said he joined the contras in 1982 after he was 
threatened and harassed by a sandinista army officer while he 
served as an evangelical pastor in his native jinotega province

after a week in which new york city teachers 
were bludgeoned slashed pummeled and blasted their union leader 
called friday for increased security and tougher sentences for 
teacher assaults 
one attack against a teacher is outrageous and to have four in 
one week is just intolerable said united federation of teachers 
president sandra feldman and were afraid that this is just the 
tip of the iceberg 
though schools officials insisted the number of attacks on 
teachers had actually decreased in three years mayor edward i 
koch said the city was concerned about teacher safety and he called 
a summit meeting tuesday of the chancellor union leaders the 
five district attorneys and police commissioner to discuss the 
problem 
the latest act of violence occurred thursday afternoon when a 
physical education teacher came upon an intruder rifling through 
students gym bags outside a bronx school and was beaten 
unconscious with a baseball bat 
gary smith 37 who remained unconscious friday was the fourth 
teacher assaulted douglas de marco was knifed monday more than a 
dozen times by a mugger in the bathroom of a south bronx grammar 
school 
the other incidents included a brooklyn teacher who was beaten 
up by a student the students brother and sister tuesday and a 
71yearold brooklyn teacher injured wednesday by an m80 
firecracker tossed into her classroom 
all the victims except smith were in good condition friday 
officials said 
theres something seriously wrong here said de marco who 
added that the attack on smith made him even more angry and 
frustrated 
the need for increased security has long been evident to de 
marco who said he teaches in a neighborhood thats known for two 
things heroin and crack 
de marco speaking from his hospital bed said his attacker was 
some young crazed guy looking to make a quick score 
the assailant got a few subway tokens and a couple of dollars 
de marco got kicked in the ribs abdomen and groin and stabbed in 
the ear neck shoulder side and back 
a few more inches and it could have been my eye or an artery 
and we wouldnt be having this conversation said de marco who 
is expected to recover 
yet the board of education said the number of assaults in city 
schools have decreased mainly because of an increase in security 
guards in elementary schools 
there were 1322 assaults in the citys 1000 schools in 198586 
and 969 this year said board spokesman bob terte 
that included 337 teachers assaulted in 198586 and 198 so far 
this year he said the rest were on students or other personnel 
including custodians and cafeteria workers an assault could be 
anything beginning with a shove against a wall terte said 
in addition terte said 350 security guards have been added in 
the last two years and the operating budget for school safety 
increased from 318 million to nearly 432 million there are 
currently 2081 guards in schools 
but the uft insists there were about 1000 physical attacks 
against teachers both last year and this year edward muir 
chairman of the uft school safety committee said about 20 percent 
required emergencyroom treatment 
though ms feldman acknowledged a decrease in teacher assaults 
and a rise in security personnel she said its obviously not 
good enough 
if we have four incidents in one week and if we have a 
situation where a teacher can be bludgeoned this way in a school 
yard while hes teaching kids then obviously the efforts and i do 
acknowledge the effort isnt enough 
she praised new schools chancellor richard green for his 
proposal to put metal detectors in five violenceprone schools this 
fall and said she felt he was anxious to stem violence 
but she said the changes cant come quick enough 
the uft wants guards in every school and police officers in 
troubled neighborhoods the union also is pushing for legislation 
to make any physical attack on a teacher a felony offense no 
matter how minor a bill is pending in the state senate 
ms feldman said that too often if the defendant is a minor 
nothing is done 
its already difficult to get teachers into the school 
system without adding problems like these ms feldman said she 
said about half the systems 63000 teachers are eligible to retire 
and these incidents are likely to prompt some to say look ive 
had it 
douglas de marco however is not one of them 
i look around this room and see all the letters and pictures 
the kids sent me and there is no way i cant go back he said

afterward that he was a vietnam veteran and that he had only a 
minor criminal record

offers of aid have poured in for rikka pash 42 since news 
accounts of his saving a mother and her six young children from 
their burning apartment building a week ago according to a social 
worker and his employer 
pash lied when he told reporters after the fire that he was a 
vietnam veteran and that he had served only one year in prison for 
cashing a social security check illegally according to a published 
report

admitted he had served several years in prison on violations 
ranging from auto theft to parole violations the chicago suntimes 
reported friday

still recuperating from a gash suffered in the fire and he was not

the un trusteeship council on friday 
brushed off soviet warnings of impending us militarization of the 
south pacific territory of palau and approved progress toward 
palaus adopting a compact of free association with america 
britain france and the united states voted in favor of a report 
urging approval of the compact and recommending that any disputes 
in interpretion be resolved between palau and america the soviet 
union voted against the report 
soviet delegate dmitri v bykov also said the report failed to 
mention racism in the south pacific the british delegate j 
stephen smith had accused the soviets on thursday of trying to 
make twisted allegations of racism where none existed 
bykov said thursday that americas true intention was to 
dominate the people of the trust territory in order to maintain 
united states strategic dominance in the area he accused the 
united states of planning to continue to strengthen and broaden 
test areas for missile technology and other military bases in the 
region 
on friday us ambassador patricia m bryne retorted that 
contrary to the assertions of a few the united states has not 
turned the trust territory into a military base and has no 
intention of doing so those who condemn the militarization of 
micronesia seek to mislead the world in order to advance their own 
agenda in the region 
the soviets have sought in recent years to negotiate fishing 
rights with several south pacific island nations since world war 
ii the region had been mainly regarded as an american preserve 
free of soviet influence 
in march adm william crowe chairman of the us joint chiefs 
of staff told the house foreign affairs committtee that palau 
would be one of the first areas that we would have to look 
at if america could no longer keep military bases in the 
philippines where treaty rights are under renegotiation 
the united states has administered palau under a un 
trusteeship since world war ii when us forces drove japanese 
occupiers from the region 
the compact of free association for palau would grant the group 
of islands selfgovernment in economic social and educational 
affairs the palau islands with a population of about 12000 are 
located about 500 miles east of the philippine island of mindanao 
in april a court in palau invalidated a 1987 referendum in 
which 73 percent of the voters approved the compact ruling that a 
75 percent majority was required to adopt it palaus government is 
expect to appeal the ruling 
moscow says the un security council can dissolve the

most yugoslavs have been reported on a mass shopping spree in 
recent weeks in anticipation of steep price rises expected when a

the new austerity program aimed at curbing europes highest 
inflation and repaying a 20 billion foreign debt provides for 
further wage cuts and widespread price increases 
the measures were originally due to start may 15 but were put 
off until june because new loans from western creditors failed to 
materialize 
the economic package is intended to reduce wages of yugoslavs by 
up to 30 percent at a time when 80 percent of manufacturers 
announced new higher prices for their products after the price 
freeze expires 
slovenian furniture manufacturers have already announced price 
increases of up to 80 percent and those of electric ware and paper 
products of up to 100 percent after the 6month freeze is lifted 
to cope with the meat shortage the government announced it was 
making available 20000 tons of meat from emergency reserves

latin america appears to be in 
a quandary over panama and its military ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
the south and central american nations that have espoused 
civilian democratic governments after decades of military rule have 
expressed little regard for noriega 
but because of their own historical experience they also look 
unkindly on overt attempts by washington to dictate who should run 
a country and how he should do it 
the little regional reaction to the breakdown in uspanamanian 
talks aimed at noriegas removal has been cautious and wavering 
the talks involved an offer from the united states to drop 
drugtrafficking charges against noriega in exchange for his 
removal as panamas leader

when the albion tornado roared toward 
east state street three years ago earl rice ran to warn his wife 
ruth on their front porch when i saw the wind pick her up and 
throw her over the rail 
across the street the rev robert j reilly prayed hard as the 
gathering winds sucked him toward a secondfloor window and his 
strength ebbed 
next door 5yearold katie steff screamed tornado coming 
as her father samuel huddled the family above their funeral home 
in a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later steff knew they 
were in the eye of the huge twister 
fortyone tornadoes including nine of the highest intensities 
swept through pennsylvania ohio new york and ontario during eight 
hours of may 31 1985 killing 88 people and injuring more than 
1000 
the tornado outbreak worst since april 1975 caused 450 
million in property damage in the united states 
of the dead 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and 
a disproportionate number 15 were between 66 and 70 years old 
according to the national weather service 
the albion tornado was among the worst packing winds estimated 
at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the 
ohiopennsylvania border the twister estimated at 1200 feet 
across quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads 
town near lake erie on a 14mile tear that killed 12 people 
i watch the sky now just like everyone else mayor bonda 
dahlin said recently tornadoes were oklahoma texas nebraska 
kind of things but i dont think its something well ever 
forget 
people here still cringe the minute theres a dark cloud in 
the sky theres such anticipation said borough secretary paul 
mcknight 
rice 72 a retired railroad worker heard the first frantic 
warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife 
get swept away he woke up trapped in his own house 
i started hollering rice recalled there were timbers all 
over me the beams were across my legs and i couldnt move they 
tried to jack up the beams but that just put more pressure on my 
legs then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and 
pulled me out 
rice suffered only cuts and bruises his wife suffered broken 
arms and a dislocated shoulder 
reilly 68 pastor of st lawrence roman catholic church was in 
his rectorys living room when the roof went off and the windows 
went out 
i kind of spreadeagled in front of the window as the thing 
began to suck me out i grabbed anything i just hung on until it 
ended reilly said i asked god to make it that i was ready to 
meet him 
the church and rectory were destroyed but two days later reilly 
said mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins 
steff 43 a mortician gathered his wife four daughters and a 
friend in the family room of their secondfloor apartment katie 
screamed just as albions fire siren began to wail 
then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom 
things just bombarded the building steff recalled then we 
heard a silence just for a second like in the eye of a hurricane 
then everything hit us from the other side patty my wife opened 
the door of the family room and it was gone 
the steffs business and home were destroyed a 200000 loss 
steff ran across the street to help free cathy gibson from her 
threestory victorian house which was down 
i called into the debris to tell her help was coming steff 
said later she told me she was never so glad to hear an 
undertakers voice 
a deputy erie county coroner steff helped set up a morgue at 
northwestern high school they brought in 11 bodies 
today the tornados southwesttonortheast path can be clearly 
seen in rebuilt splitlevel houses and new mobile homes grassy 
lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of albion 
look like a new subdivision 
it was only a few months ago mcknight said that he closed 
the books on albions claims with federal and state disaster 
officials 
mayor dahlin estimated that fewer than 200 of the towns 1800 
people moved away after the tornado because of memories lack of 
money or whatever 
people are getting on with their lives she said 
businesses are being rebuilt changing hands and there are new 
ones 
reillys modern new 400seat church is linked by a glass 
breezeway to a new threebedroom rectory behind a new recreation 
building stands in red brick the complex cost 11 million he 
said 
one of the greatest experiences of my life as tragic as it 
was was to see the spirit of the people of this town they took a 
tragic blow they rebuilt the town reilly said 
its almost profane to say it was a good thing but the bottom 
line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town 
is even physically better with all the new construction he said 
the steffs fully insured rebuilt their small funeral home with 
two viewing rooms but took the opportunity to move their living 
quarters to a house in another part of town 
we shed our tears over it were trying to get our lives 
together you can dwell on the negatives but the positives are the 
concern and the love of the community steff said 
when i walked out the door that day i knew i was going to 
stay 
the rices built a modern twobedroom splitlevel house its 
starting to feel like home rice said with a shrug 
you still think about it last september i had an operation 
for cancer and when i was in the recovery room i thought i was 
still under the house he said 
i dont want to see another one

long after colonialism yielded to 
independence for many african nations their art is still in the 
grip of europe 
masks sculptures ritual objects jewelry once mere utensils 
for african tribes have become coveted art pieces in europe and 
a show at the palais des beauxarts here shows interest is still 
gaining 
african art is so abundant in such former colonial powers as 
belgium that the show relied on 50 private collections for 
material organizers say there was no need to tap other sources 
such as museums religious orders and companies with a colonial 
past to stage the exhibit that has been widely acclaimed 
in colonial times the pieces were brought here and stacked 
away and little happened afterwards said elze bruyninx an 
organizer of the brussels show now there is increasing interest 
for their aesthetic qualities 
as the exhibit demonstrates private collectors have had a sharp 
eye for quality what we found in private collections was world 
class quality said frank herreman of antwerps ethnographical 
museum who helped stage the exhibit 
the show displays 330 pieces many from central africa 
featuring the severe expressionist lines that mark african art it 
includes terracotta pieces over 2000 years old from nigeria and 
centuriesold wooden and metal statues and masks from mali and 
mozambique many are from the former belgian colony zaire others 
are from as far away as angola 
they are on view until midjune and already over 20000 people 
have visited the show since it opened in late march 
the richness of european collections has long been a source of 
misgiving in african nations 
some spurred by president mobutu sese seko of zaire have in 
recent decades joined such nations as greece which has staged 
diplomatic protests to focus on the loss of some of its finest art 
to invading european powers 
imbata mosumbe cultural director of the zairian embassy in 
brussels laments that legislation has never been enacted to ensure 
the return of art works 
we wish it would return we only have moral arguments though 
and to rely on morals is a pious wish he said 
mobutu told the united nations that the colonial powers had 
taken everything and that they now had to give it back said 
huguette van geluwe head of the ethnography department of the 
museum of central africa near brussels one of the worlds biggest 
treasure troves of african art it boasts an extensive collection 
of zairian art 
since the waning days of colonialism in the 1960s some art 
works have returned home from former colonial powers but it has 
been more a trickle than the flow that african nations wanted 
african leaders and the intellectuals are now very conscious 
of its value and appreciate the pieces as art said bruyninx 
however this was not always so what is now called african art 
often had its origins as simple utensils african masks and 
sculptures had medical or protective functions the notion of art 
for arts sake was a novel concept of africas colonizers 
from the moment an object lost its function it became 
worthless bruyninx said often they rotted in the tropical 
conditions or were even ritually destroyed 
as a pure art object it was seldom of value she said 
europe soon changed that after the utensils and other objects 
came to europe as exotic curiosities some european artists 
including pablo picasso created an active interest by blending it 
into their own works 
bruyninx said the objects were well cared for in europe where 
african art became a phenomenon in its own right 
many africans are pleased when they see what has happened with 
their art here van geluwe said they see it as a showcase for 
their country 
the utotombo exhibit in brussels for example has been endorsed 
by zaires ambassador here despite zaires hope of recovering its 
art from belgium 
contradictions are the spice of life mosumbe said 
although much african art is now in europe and the united 
states many works is still in africa according to herreman 
what makes it tough for many african nations is that their 
museums are not suitably managed to handle it he said 
for one thing there is the lure of money with some pieces 
fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars at auctions in the west 
some art works simply disappear from african museums experts say 
and even when an african museum has a firstright option on 
national art works it often cannot afford them

economists are uncovering peculiar similarities 
in events that range from the death of the steampowered automobile 
in the early 1900s to the crash of the stock market last october 
the decline of sonys betamax they find has something in 
common with the birth of the auto industry in detroit 
there are even similarities between the width of railroad tracks 
and the strange qwerty arrangement of keys on a typewriter 
in different ways these rises and falls all defy economic 
doctrines of stability 
all are examples of positive feedback things that get 
going in one direction and then keep going the same way like an 
avalanche or a whistling microphone or a buffalo stampede 
positive feedback helps explain what happened last oct 19 when 
corporate america lost nearly a quarter of its paper value in a 
single day 
when prices dropped that day buyers should have come in to pick 
up bargains but trading strategies such as portfolio insurance 
locked the market into a suicidal loop of positive feedback so 
each price decline triggered fresh sales 
portfolio insurers said they could protect investors against 
losses by selling their stocks and putting the money into 
interestbearing treasury bills it worked until everybody else 
tried to sell at the same time 
the loop was finally broken on oct 20 when the us financial 
system was nearing gridlock 
if all stocks had been covered by portfolio insurance the dow 
jones industrial average theoretically could have sunk to zero 
that is the power of positive feedback 
in less frightening ways positive feedback explains other 
things that defy traditional concepts of equilibrium 
once the vhs format got a slight edge over sonys betamax for 
example video rental shops began stocking more vhs tapes that 
encouraged more people to buy vhs recorders and so on now even 
sony corp has added a vhs recorder line 
snowball effects likewise account for how railroad tracks that 
are 4 feet 8 inches wide crowded out other gauges or why autos 
and electronics came to be concentrated in detroit and silicon 
valley instead of evenly spread across the country 
herds of buffalo eventually get tired of stampeding and at some 
point salaries for electronics engineers may get so high in silicon 
valley that it makes sense to locate elsewhere 
tired buffalo and overcrowding in silicon valley are examples of 
negative feedback which leads to the cherished equilibrium of 
standard economics 
in some cases though negative feedback never kicks in society 
becomes locked in to use the phrase of w brian arthur a 
professor of population studies and economics at stanford 
university who has done pioneering research in the field 
paul david a colleague of arthur at stanford has traced how 
the qwerty typewriter layout has persisted in spite of the obvious 
superiority of the dvorak simplified keyboard which is 20 to 40 
percent faster and can be learned in a few days 
then there is the clean efficient steampowered automobile 
which exists no more years ago smelly gasolinepowered cars 
gained some tiny advantage that grew into total dominance because 
the country was not big enough for two kinds of cars 
in 1904 a man named william fletcher with a cloudy crystal ball 
wrote unless the objectionable features of the petrol carriage 
can be removed it is bound to be driven from the road to give 
place to its less objectionable rival the steamdriven vehicle of 
the day 
fletcher knew the power of positive feedback he just bet on the 
wrong horseless carriage 
in 1988 its clear that many people dont know the power of 
positive feedback for example whiz kids in finance failed to 
foresee the damage that portfolio insurance could wreak in a 
falling stock market 
knowing about the snowball effect doesnt guarantee being able 
to do anything about it but who knows one thing could lead to 
another

the name for this village in hebrew 
and arabic means oasis of peace and it is taken seriously by 
the arabs and jews who have been living here together for the past 
10 years in the judean foothills 
the recent palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west 
bank and gaza strip has created strains for them but it has also 
brought new levels of cooperation and understanding to the 
communitys 14 families nine jewish five israeli arab 
its paradoxical said abed najah an arab who is the 
village secretary the uprising has made us stronger we are more 
certain than ever that what we are doing is the best and most 
important thing to do 
those who came to live in the village that once was a no mans 
land 15 miles west of jerusalem chose to span the national and 
religious divide that splits israeli jews and arabs into hostile 
and suspicious groups 
here they share authority educate their children in hebrew and 
arabic and try to spread a message of tolerance to visiting 
israeli high school children through special seminars in their 
school of peace 
living together for a decade has never been simple however 
arab residents had to fight for official recognition for the 
arabic name for the village wahati alsalaam also under a 
compromise agreement jews observe the israeli independence day 
holiday while arabs do not 
but the 70 residents are determined to find an alternative to 
the current realities of arabjewish relations 
outside neve shalom tensions between arabs and jews have been 
seriously exacerbated over the past five months by the palestinian 
uprising 
neve shalom has been largely protected from the tensions 
according to ariella beeri 29 an israeli spokeswoman for the 
school of peace and a longtime resident of the village 
the uprising was not new for anyone who already developed 
social and political awareness she said we have always been 
aware of the reality of the occupation 
jews and arabs in neve shalom regard the arab revolt as a sign 
that the palestinians have taken responsibility for their own fate 
i am very proud of the uprising said najah the village 
secretary today the palestinians are writing the brightest page 
of their history 
until now neve shalom or wahati alsalaam avoided politics so 
as not to drive away jewish high school children from the school of 
peace seminars 
but the palestinian uprising has changed that recently all 70 
neve shalom residents demonstrated in jerusalem against what they 
view as excessively harsh measures used by the isreali army to 
supress palestinian demonstrators 
neve shalom also has set up exchange visits with the nearby west 
bank village of bet sira and has sent its residents food supplies 
we visited just after the soldiers were there said najah 
we saw the fear in their eyes and how the women and children 
stank of tear gas 
we always thought of neve shalom as an educational project 
he added but weve seen lately that things are happening that 
force us to take action 
the residents of neve shalom are reluctant to discuss tensions 
caused in their community by the palestinian uprising but one 
especially sensitive point is military reserve duty required of 
jewish residents of neve shalom but not the arabs 
so far none of the four residents called up have been sent to 
the west bank or gaza strip 
the village doesnt tell them what to do said ms beeri 
but theres a lot of social pressure for them not to serve in the 
occupied territories if they go it will be hard for them to face 
the others 
ms beeri says the uprising has altered relations between the 
jewish and arabs students who come for the peace seminars however 
the uprising is strengthening the arabs it is giving them the 
feeling that someone is looking out for their interests the jews 
are frightened by the power of the uprising by how close it is to 
them geographically 
the seminar talks also have taken on a new urgency the jewish 
high school students see the issues as personal and crucial 
they are only a year away from being drafted into the army and 
that is likely to lead to direct and violent confrontation with 
palestinians 
beeri said one jewish student put it succinctly when he said 
goodbye to arab students at the end of a seminar 
see you again at the stonethrowing he said

as the snow melts in the himalayas 
winters natural barrier comes down and it becomes the task of men 
mules and machines of the indian army to take up a long summer 
vigil on the disputed frontier with china 
last summer the worlds two most populous nations massed 300000 
troops along the border after trading charges of border violations 
this summer we are leaving nothing to chance after last years 
experience said an army officer in the garrison town of shillong 
in northeastern india 
starting in may the dormant status of the 105000 indian 
soldiers stationed on the frontier in arunachal pradesh state was 
upgraded to live the officer said this means the troops can 
be called for combat on short notice 
it does not mean we are preparing for a war or itching for it 
but this is the price we have to pay to keep the chinese dragon 
away said the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
india and china fought a border war in 1962 and their relations 
have remained strained china claims 34750 square miles of indian 
land that covers the entire state of arunachal pradesh 
india not only rejects the chinese claim to the state but says 
beijing captured 14000 square miles of northwestern kashmir state 
during the 1962 war 
china has offered to give up its claim to arunachal pradesh if 
india recognizes beijings sovereignty over areas of kashmir but 
in eight rounds of talks that began in december 1981 india has 
refused the chinese offer claiming both areas belong to india 
an indian reporter for the associated press recently toured the 
northeastern states which are offlimits to foreigners to see the 
indian armys preparedness 
long military convoys moved regularly from the central command 
base of tezpur in assam state to border areas in neighboring 
arunachal pradesh trucks towed tarpaulincovered field guns 
hundreds of mules hauled rations and artillery through terrain so 
rugged that india has not been able to build roads 
in the last two months india has sent two divisions 30000 
soldiers in all to arunachal pradesh to reinforce 75000 troops 
already stationed on the frontier 
an additional 60000 soldiers are garrisoned within about 300 
miles of the frontier 
the indian air force has up to 160 interceptors 55 to 60 
deeppenetration aircraft and 35 to 40 bombers in the region 
our military presence in the eastern sector is enough to 
counter any chinese military adventures a senior defense 
ministry official in new delhi said 
a chinese diplomat in new delhi said the indians were 
exaggerating the socalled chinese threat 
we have neither the intention nor the need to push indian 
troops back we are happy where we are the diplomat said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
but brig rs virk who retired from the indian army last year 
said in an interview in assam the whole exercise is more of a 
shadow boxing than real military necessity 
there is nothing to gain in the godforsaken land not even a 
blade of grass grows there 
the border dispute between china and india stems from a line 
drawn on a map in 1914 by sir henry mcmahon foreign secretary of 
british colonial india 
india accepts the line or its interpretation of it china does 
not 
the mcmahon line was drawn with a thick red pencil on the map 
the line covers in breadth four to five miles in actual territory 
border tension in the area started in may 1986 with reports that 
china had moved in troops and built a helipad in the sumdrong chu 
valley the valley lies one to two miles south of the mcmahon line 
according to india and north of it according to china 
in april 1987 indian troops advanced close to chinese soldiers 
the indians said they spotted intruding chinese patrols in four 
areas claimed by india china rejected the indian report and 
accused india of setting up seven lookout posts north of the line 
china has a population of 102 billion and 29 million men under 
arms india with 800 million people has 12 million military 
personnel but india has air superiority in its soviet and french 
aircraft 
the summer vigil however costs india an additional 100000 a 
day in highaltitude pay for soldiers extra rations and air 
surveillance 
that puts more economic strain on a nation that has 37 percent 
of its people living below the poverty line

peel back the carpet in the executive suite and 
youll need a shovel to dig through whats been swept underneath 
at least thats the tone of the rollicking misfortune 500 a 
210page catalog of corporate americas worst bosses dumbest 
strategies and most disastrous products 
authors bruce nash and allan zullos guiding premise is that 
business blunders dont get the attention they deserve thanks to 
uptight execs who are basically humorless except when it 
comes to the faux pas of their competitors 
we have a great respect for big business because it is the 
backbone of america but they have to learn to lighten up a little 
bit nash said 
from the adams natural beverage co to zale corp these two 
irreverent business bashers dug for the dirt and found it 
among the biggest blunders they roast the mars candy company 
for passing up the chance to have mampms featured in the 1982 
boxoffice blockbuster et the movies lovable alien devoured 
reeses pieces instead boosting sales for rival chocolate maker 
hershey food corp 
and speaking of chocolate from the 
productsthatdidntgetofftheground thank god department is 
chocolate styling gel for hair the category also includes parsnip 
chips 
nash and zullo both 40 and both residents of palm beach 
gardens fla say they met at a party five years ago and soon 
began building a cottage industry of shame 
since then they have published five different sportsoriented 
hall of shame books starting with the baseball hall of 
shame 
the business book took a solid three months of research and 
another few months to write nash said its official publication 
date is june 1 and the price is 795 
in their book nash and zullo question chrysler corp chairman 
lee iacoccas sincerity in urging everybody to buy american 
when he appears in ads clutching a cigar rolled in the dominican 
republic 
and they ask why coleco industries inc reneged on a promise to 
mail first birthday cards to the 32 million cabbage patch kids 
registered with the toy maker 
the duo even counted up the many ways corporations say 
layoffs itt corp once called them headcount reductions 
the accounting firm peat marwick mitchell amp co used the phrase 
requested departures and control data corp called them 
workforce adjustments 
disasters that are particularly prickly for companies are those 
that involve the press at one news conference that went awry the 
president of rival pet food chowed down a new allbeef dinner after 
a persnickety collie turned its nose up at the grub 
for eager shareholders ready to head for the annual meeting 
nash and zullo suggest they buy a plane ticket and take along a map 
if they want to meet up with some elusive boards of directors 
schlumberger ltd held its meeting on the island of curacao in 1984 
lots of shareholders there and general host corp held its 1967 
meeting in the middle of the florida everglades perhaps to 
accommodate any stockowning mosquitoes 
some companies learned the hard way that it doesnt always pay 
to go out of their way united airlines once sent thankyou letters 
to wives of executives who had participated in the airlines fly 
your wife free campaign 
but the airline was inundated with angry letters from outraged 
wives who had never flown their friendly skies the spouses even 
demanded the names of their executive husbands flying companions 
nash and zullo say the most important lesson businesses need to 
learn is not to fear mistakes as for their next project we 
dont yet know where well look to uncover more shame nash said

sydows first englishlanguage appearance on the london stage he 
previously appeared in britain in 1974 in a swedish staging of 
henrik ibsens the wild duck 
that production was directed by ingmar bergman with whom von 
sydow has had a long and illustrious career on stage and in such 
films as the seventh seal wild strawberries through a 
glass darkly and the passion of anna 
on broadway von sydow has starred in two flops the night of 
the tribades with eileen atkins and bibi andersson and duet 
for one with anne bancroft 
its a very interesting idea von sydow 58 said of 
director millers choice that he play prospero a part more often 
associated with english actors in their twilight years 
miller in a separate interview explained his casting 
i wanted to break out of the noble aria approach english 
performers often take to the part said miller who is in his 
first year as the artistic director of londons venerable old vic 
ive never seen max on stage but i know he is a great 
accomplished actor ive seen all his films 
prospero furthers what has been an unusually busy year for von 
sydow he is presently appearing at the national theater of 
stockholm in august strindbergs 1872 master olof 
in bille augusts prizewinning danish film pelle the 
conqueror von sydow heads up a family of immigrant farmworkers

critical praise the film won la palme dor the top prize at the 
41st annual cannes film festival which ended on may 23 
von sydow was also represented at cannes with his directorial 
debut katinka adapted from a novel by the danish author 
herman bang about a threeway love affair 
he said he had originally hoped to act in a movie version of the 
book when he first read the novel 25 years ago 
now since he was too old for the male leads he decided to 
direct the movie instead coincidence put the possibility in my 
hands 
of his englishlanguage films von sydow said he looked back 
fondly on hannah and her sisters woody allens 1986 movie in 
which he played barbara hersheys tortured irascible companion 
most of the scripts one gets are so bad it was wonderful to 
receive one with intelligent dialogue said the actor who felt 
challenged by allens requirements 
he allen demands 200 percent of a naturalistic style he 
does not allow any literary phrasings or pronunciation von sydow 
said 
this version of the tempest will mark the fourth major 
production of the play to be seen in england this year both the 
star and his director said they would not be seeing the others 
its very disturbing to be influenced said von sydow who 
last played shakespeares conjurerpoet in a swedish production 35 
years ago when he said he was much too young 
miller said i dont go very much to the theater its too 
much of a busmans holiday

it would seem in view of the muchvisited 
vietnam veterans memorial in washington and the popularity of 
vietnam movies in the theaters and on tv that america has finally 
welcomed the vietnam veteran home 
but as reported in the powerful cbs documentary the wall 
within this thursday as many as 1 million vietnam veterans have 
yet to leave behind a war that still terrorizes them every day and 
little has been done to help them some have committed suicide and 
abused their families others suffer flashbacks nightmares and 
withdrawal 
cbs went to washington state where many veterans who suffer 
from post traumatic stress disorder have fled the dense forests 
perhaps reminiscent of the jungles of vietnam shelter them from a 
world where they cannot speak of the atrocities they witnessed 
they literally took to the hills cbs anchor dan rather said 
in an interview rather interviewed some of the veterans and 
narrates the documentary which was produced and directed by paul 
and holly fine and written by perry wolff 
i dont want to have to be nobody all my life says terry 
bradley one of the veterans interviewed for the documentary id 
want to be able to come home with some dignity 
bradleys reward for his service in vietnam was overmedication 
as a paranoid schizophrenic that left him with organic brain 
damage other veterans tell of facing rejection and indifference 
when they returned from combat 
this hour that we do this is not the movie platoon this is 
real stuff said rather these are real people struggling to 
recover from real wounds 
another of the veterans interviewed describes how he almost 
killed his mother when she woke him one morning and he thought she 
was the enemy 
some of the veterans are beginning to deal with ptsd in the only 
way they can by talking to other veterans in rap groups sponsored 
by vietnam veterans centers many of which will soon be closed due 
to lack of funding 
one reason some of the veterans talked to cbs was because rather 
had been in vietnam as a reporter 
they wont even consider talking to somebody who didnt go to 
vietnam he said it was slow going to even get them to talk to 
us so my reporting from vietnam was a help rather said he also 
had to listen to a lot of complaints about how the war was reported 
one veteran took rather on a flashlight visit to the small 
unlit room he keeps at the back of his basement where the walls are 
covered with rough drawings like a cavedwellers depicting his 
vietnam nightmares 
as very young people they were plunged into a green jungle 
hell said rather they saw terrible and horrific things they 
saw these things done to others done to themselves then suddenly 
they are jerked back and dumped back into a country where in many 
cases they were despised humiliated criticized and still very 
young is it any wonder that they suffered a psychological wound 
that is deep and abiding 
another veteran suffers from a symptom of ptsd called 
hypervigilance he recalls with great difficulty watching a 
buddy die on the deck of an aircraft carrier because he was not 
alert enough so he patrols incessantly at night driving city 
streets or back roads in his truck 
mike rice suffers from flashbacks viewers like rather will be 
moved to reach out physically to rice as he breaks down while he 
struggles to describe the aftermath of an enemy attack 
i noticed the sergeant kinda laying over some of the pipes 
over there i knew he was hurt and hed always kinda come around 
and showed us a picture of his family his wife his little boy 
and little girl he was just laying over there and i thought god 
no ones helpin this guy and i ran over there to help him and 
reached down and grabbed him and he was um he was um he was 
blown in half he was bbblown in half it was just his top half 
it was just his top half left he breaks down into sobs 
hes healing assures rather hes healing because until 
now he couldnt tell this story to anyone he had his flashbacks 
alone 
cbs seems to have helped the healing somewhat by bringing three 
of the veterans bradley rice and john michaelson to the vietnam 
veterans memorial where they wept as they found the names of 
buddies they lost in vietnam it is these moving scenes shot just 
before dawn that conclude the documentary to the strains of 
appalachian spring

talking about money is something that just wasnt 
done in britain until only a few years ago 
now because of prime minister margaret thatchers capitalist 
revolution business economics and personal finance are 
increasingly popular subjects on british television 
the number of television hours devoted to money matters has 
grown to more than 200 a year from about 30 hours annually just 
four years ago 
business is suddenly a much more interesting topic said 
caroline thomson independent channel 4s commissioning editor for 
business industry and science 
the new shows have included a daily news show a game show and 
even a dramatic series 
britains two publicly funded british broadcasting corp 
channels and two independent channels are all thinking money but 
the biggest push has been made by channel 4 
in september it introduced business daily a halfhour news 
program airing at midday monday through friday and targeted at 
professionals in the city londons financial district 
in addition channel 4 introduced in january a sunday night game 
show the stocks and shares show in which contestants compete 
to make the most profit by investing play money in stocks 
channel 4 also recently ran a live weekly series called the 
business exchange which gave advice to some of britains budding 
entrepreneurs on how to get financing and other topics 
also unusual was a sixpart weekly dramatic series set in the 
city rather than more typically in londons swanky neighborhoods 
the cockney east end or the governments labyrinthian buildings 
called killing on the exchange it ran on independent 
televisions main channel in prime time last year 
there has been a big change in attitude in the past five years 
toward business with privatization and the big bang explosion in 
the city ms thomson said 
mrs thatcher has privatized or sold off billions of pounds 
worth of nationalized industries since she came into power in 1979 
partly to get more shares into the hands of the british public 
the number of individual shareholders in britain has trebled to 
7 million in the nine years 
big bang most of which took place in october 1986 was a huge 
deregulation and computerization of britains financial services 
industry 
now in mrs thatchers britain people can talk about profit 
without it being a dirty word ms thomson said 
not all television viewers have been capitivated by these money 
matters programs ms thomson conceded that talking about personal 
finances is still taboo for many britons 
the respectable thing in britain is not to talk about 
finances even how much they paid for a house there are all sorts 
of traditions about not revealing how much you earn she said 
thats part of the british being rather buttonedup people 
the husband of a woman interviewed for moneyspinner a 
channel 4 personal finances program had a fit when he found out 
about it and insisted that the interview be deleted ms thomson 
said 
still moneyspinner which appears tuesday nights in series 
of eight programs is the most popular of the money shows on 
channel 4 attracting about 2 million viewers 
the stocks and shares show has its detractors too 
its caused more controversy than anything else ive done 
ms thomson said critics feel the channel shouldnt encourage 
speculation she said 
the innovative programming comes on top of an increase in the 
number of more traditional types of money matters shows such as 
the weekly current affairs programs and the odd documentary on for 
example insider trading 
the oldest and most popular money program on british television 
is bbc 2s 22yearold the money programme a currentaffairs 
show viewed by almost 3 million people on sunday evenings 
the show features hosts conducting studio interviews with 
businessworld celebrities and expanded segments on newsworthy 
topics 
the trend is evident in the theater too currently running are 
the british plays serious money which is also playing in new 
york and speculators

austrian bestselling writer 
johannes mario simmel churns out the kind of pop novels west 
germans love to read in secret 
his crime and romance tales have captivated the general public 
but horrified many highbrow critics and intellectuals in the last 
40 years they have called simmel everything from a cliche 
factory to an opium for the masses 
the popular author remains unruffled however his books have 
made him one of the worlds bestselling germanlanguage writers 
more than 65 million copies of his novels have been sold around the 
world appearing in 25 languages including english 
his latest work a thriller about gene technologists bent on 
world destruction has been high on national bestseller lists 
since it hit the market last august 
the book is also selling well in france italy spain the 
netherlands yugoslavia and the scandinavian countries where 
simmel has been popular for years 
the only country where they have this terrible 
schoolteachertype criticism of my work is west germany the 
64yearold austrian said in an interview 
notice from other countries include a johannes mario simmel 
collection of the authors more than 20 works at the boston 
university library 
simmels current best seller is but with clowns came the 
tears which focuses on the aids epidemic and the dangers of gene 
technology it was released by the munichbased droemerknaur 
verlag publishing house and has not yet been scheduled for the 
united states 
in the book the superpowers are locked in a battle over genetic 
and viral manipulation techniques that could determine the fate of 
the world 
contemporary issues have always been the driving force of my 
work simmel said my novels are not really novels they are a 
combination of fact and fiction 
it would be a crime to just write fiction when there are so 
many horrible things happening in the world important issues 
people should be made aware of 
in novels and screenplays simmel has treated such themes as 
alcoholism he is a recovered alcoholic education of the 
psychologically disturbed and fascism and the nazi period 
i will write against nazis and neonazis as long as i live to 
me they are the greatest criminals in history simmel said 
adding that the nazi period was one of the worst of his life 
during most of the war he was a chemist in vienna 
one work dealing with the nazi era the monte cristo 
coverup made simmel famous in the early 1960s the often 
humorous account of a wartime cook and spy included numerous 
gourmet recipes 
simmel partly attributes his focus on current events to his 
roots as a journalist he spent years as a reporter for the 
austrian daily newspaper welt am abend and the west german weekly 
newsmagazine quick 
the writer said journalism has also influenced his painstaking 
research methods simmel spends up to a year gathering facts for a 
book 
i traveled to several countries researching gene technology 
for example talking to experts he said 
but contemporary relevance and authenticity alone are not what 
makes his books sell he readily admits 
my trick is to report about these grave issues and package 
them in an entertaining story simmel said 
his new book opens with a circus performance where clowns 
suddenly shoot into the audience the clowns were hired to kill a 
noted geneticist who was at the show but they also hit the child of 
a news reporter she immediately gets on the case 
as in every simmel as his books are called there is a love 
story this time between the reporter and a scientist pulled into 
the chain of events 
and it is precisely the entertainment side of his work that has 
given simmel trouble with critics and the more literary minded 
many people here dont like to admit they enjoy simmel 
frankfurter allgemeine zeitung critic frank schirrmacher said in an 
interview its not seen as intellectual enough 
schirrmacher said the embarrassment is due to a seriousminded 
german literary tradition 
theres no tradition in germany of entertaining literature 
thats also considered high quality schirrmacher said 
literature here has to be complicated not easily understood in 
order to be respected 
the grayhaired bespectacled simmel lives in zug switzerland 
which he said he now regards as his home his wife died of cancer 
in 1985

when mary hart was growing up in sioux 
falls sd her mother often worried about the future 
entertainment tonight host running away to become a showgirl 
well mom dont look now but 
the perky blonde who taught high school english and piano while 
doing community theater and dreaming of a show business career 
recently made her stage debut in las vegas 
with more bookings here and in atlantic city plus summer stock 
and music festivals this summer harts ready to continue her dual 
professional role although shed just as soon skip those 18hour 
days juggling two careers in two cities 
her grueling daily grind shuttling between this citys glitter 
gulch for her longawaited fling at singing and dancing then back 
to a hollywood et set for more tv patter gave new meaning to 
the concept of commuting to work 
hart realized a lifelong dream when she spent two weeks 
appearing with comedian david brenner at the golden nugget hotel 
and casino earlier this month 
but she admits she wouldnt care for a steady diet of the double 
duty 
i performed at 8 and again at 11 she said then i caught 
a 1 am flight to los angeles and hit the house about 245 i got 
up at 730 and was at paramount where et is filmed by 8 am we 
did our promos and other spots then began taping the show at 1130 
am at 245 in the afternoon i was on a flight back to vegas 
both worlds is not an ideal situation she laughed as she 
relaxed between shows during her twoweek engagement its 
conceivable to do one show a night and commute for a short period 
of time 
in her show hart does several dance numbers and displays a 
surprisingly good singing voice her appearance and style are 
reminiscent of annmargret when she was a las vegas headliner for 
years 
harts sexy legs insured by lloyds of london for 2 million 
are amply displayed in the las vegas show the legs are a product 
of a lot of hard work including a treadmill rowing machine and 
exercycle at home 25 miles of speedwalking a week and aerobics 
and dance classes 
she admits that coming into this town with a nationally known 
name didnt hurt her chances for success but she thinks she had to 
have more than just a pretty recognizable face and 2 million 
legs 
you know youre putting it all on the line when you come in 
here as a coheadliner she said theres no way of hiding it 
but i wanted to do it i was both exhilarated and intimidated by 
the experience 
her songanddance debut has given her a new appreciation of the 
people she covers on et 
theres a lot of rejection and hard knocks im far more 
appreciative for having experienced it firsthand 
hart admits to something of a walter mitty lifestyle since her 
days in south dakota shes been a finalist in the miss america 
pageant 1971 been a host of et for five years sparred with 
david letterman sung the national anthem at los angeles dodgers 
games ridden with the blue angels flight team danced on the emmy 
awards show injured one leg in a fall from the high wire on a 
circus of the stars performance and been cohost of the 
tournament of roses parade coverage and the regis philbin show 
despite all those credits she thinks her stage debut at the 
golden nugget was one of her toughest gigs 
i prepared for the opening for months she recalled then 
the day of the opening after working all afternoon in dress 
rehearsals i almost felt like i couldnt do it i proceeded to cry 
for three hours 
part of it was sheer fear part of it was excitement there 
were moments of being panicstricken but the overriding emotion 
was one of exhilaration 
i have really always seen myself as an entertainer she 
said you dream those things but you dont know for sure if 
theyll ever happen i think that was part of my emotionalism 
realizing those things had come true 
a few dreams a broadway play and her own tv sitcom remain 
unfulfilled but at age 35 she thinks time is on her side 
shes learned to roll with the punches to be patient 
after doing radio and tv talk shows in sioux falls cedar 
rapids iowa and oklahoma city she moved west to headline pm 
magazine she left that show to cohost regis philbin which 
folded four months later 
i was out of work and out of money she recalled that was 
a time i was terribly disappointed then et came along thank 
heaven for my midwestern upbringing and positive thinking 
my parents always told me that the bad times accentuate the 
good ive always translated the negative experiences into good in 
the long run im a big believer that life goes on you get back 
from life what you put into it

guitarist john abercrombie stood in a tangle of 
foot switches and wires on stage at the jazz showcase nodding 
toward a guitar synthesizer and bank of boxes sparkling with 
twinkling lights behind him 
he introduced his next number adding it would be his last 
before he unleashed all this beastly equipment 
by todays standards of sound processing it was a 
modestlooking collection of electronic wizardry including his 
synthesizer a digital reverb and delay and a stereo chorus in 
addition to his ibanez guitar and standard power amplifier and 
preamplifier 
yet there was one of the most progressive jazz guitar stylists 
feeling his way through the technical forest it was clear evidence 
that music technology can outstrip a musicians ability to adapt it 
to his playing 
i like it abercrombie said of advances in music technology 
its frustrating but definitely its another instrument the 
synthesizer makes me hear differently it makes me compose 
differently 
it becomes another way to express yourself and thats what you 
want to do 
abercrombie and trio mates peter erskine on drums and marc 
johnson on bass were in chicago recently at the start of a 2week 
tour of the midwest south and east 
abercrombie 43 lives in new york hes been a force in guitar 
improvisation for most of the 20 years he has spent touring the 
world 
advances in music technology are another step in the evolution 
of jazz which has progressed partly through a oneupsmanship 
philosophy he said in an interview 
during the bebop era that was the style du jour 
it wasnt technology but its keeping up with the joneses 
until the next cat comes along and says i want to do something 
different he said 
advances in technology also have helped abercrombie in his own 
music 
i think overall this technology has helped my guitar playing 
i think it has made me a more fluid player and made me appreciate 
the guitar more he said 
appreciation at least popular and commercial appreciation 
still elude abercrombie although he claims no hardship 
a steady player and recording artist for germanbased ecm 
records abercrombie acknowledges his music isnt easily grasped by 
an american public that defines jazz as more poporiented music 
abercrombies playing is easily described as eclectic a blues 
riff might give way to introspective brooding before rising to 
rocklevel decibels hell toss in a hook from a jazz standard for 
good measure 
european jazz fans seem to accept abercrombie more than their 
us counterparts he says 
i think my music has always been a little off to the weird 
side abercrombie said its not always music people sit down 
and listen to it all has to do with accessibility 
i think the music i choose to play is less accessible to many 
people he saidits more important for me and the people i 
know to try to expand the jazz tradition 
and if that means using technology i will 
but there is a price to pay for relying on the new machines 
said abercrombie who counts as his primary influences 
traditionalists wes montgomery and jim hall 
you do realize that synthesizers will drain you if you use 
them all the time he said 
and he has some advice for the wizards who create music 
technology 
what id like to say is why dont you guys slow down and let 
us learn how to play what weve got the thing i dont like is 
every three months something new comes out

some hollywood stars are beginning to shine for 
favored candidates in the june 7 california primary election but 
many democratic celebrities remain uncommitted in a race 
complicated by jesse jacksons antijewish image 
not that big money isnt being raised nor is all the glitter 
gone 
for example radio personality casey kasem and his actress wife 
jean are hosts for a celebrity fundraiser for jackson on june 5 
at trendy spago restaurant known for its unconventional california 
pizzas 
among those expected to attend the 1000aslice westerntheme 
party are eddie murphy debbie allen hugh hefner herbie hancock 
billy davis jr and marilyn mccoo 
hollywood support is often vigorously sought by political 
candidates who know stars attract attention money and they hope 
voters to a campaign 
on the republican side where the race was over long ago cheryl 
ladd robert stack and producer jerry weintraub have endorsed vice 
president george bush while frank sinatra tom selleck helen 
hayes oscar de la renta and yvette mimieux have made contributions 
to his campaign said bushs deputy finance chairman fred bush 
but things are messier among the democrats 
so far this season sally field oliver stone richard gere ed 
begley jr tony randall carly simon leonard nimoy and shelley 
winters have endorsed michael dukakis the democratic frontrunner 
according to the massachusetts governors local spokesman mike 
devereaux 
jackson has attracted many black celebrities to his camp 
including comedians bill cosby and murphy as well as quincy jones 
lou gossett jr and gladys knight and some white performers have 
pledged their support including valerie harper margot kidder and 
dennis weaver 
however most hollywood democrats the show business 
communitys dominant party have yet to endorse either jackson or 
dukakis 
hollywood has always been mostly jewish and liberal said 
alex ben block editor of show biz news a twicemonthly newsletter 
covering the business side of the entertainment industry 
from a jewish point of view its almost unconscionable to 
support jackson he said however neither is there any public 
rush to oppose the black civil rights activist who is the most 
liberal candidate in the race 
rabbi marvin hier dean of the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles said jews in hollywood are caught between black friends 
who are asking them to consider jackson and jewish friends who say 
they must oppose him 
people are caught anyone who endorses jesse jackson will not 
be thought of as a hero in the jewish community hier said 
among conservative jewish people in this industry jesse 
jackson is simply unacceptable said michael medved film critic 
for pbs sneak previews and president of the pacific jewish 
center the feeling is so intense friendships would be so 
imperiled and business would be imperiled 
jackson alienated many jews by referring to new york as 
hymietown in 1984 by publicly embracing yasser arafat of the 
palestine liberation organization and by being associated with 
muslim leader louis farrakhan 
the uncommitted hollywood group includes such activists as 
twotime oscar winner jane fonda and her husband assemblyman tom 
hayden norman lear emmy awardwinning producer of televisions 
the archie bunker show and lew wasserman chairman of mca inc 
they were among those on show biz news list of the 10 most 
powerful political fundraisers in hollywood 
lear whose political organization people for the american 
way mounted a nationwide campaign to defeat the nomination of 
robert bork to the us supreme court is busy with his new 
production company act iii said his spokeswoman betsy kenny 
when you jump into a presidential campaign it takes a lot of 
work and commitment and he doesnt feel compelled to do so at this 
time ms kenny said 
miss fonda has been in mexico since january filming old 
gringo with costars gregory peck and jimmy smits 
she has no plans to endorse anyone before the primary said 
spokesman steve rivers her mind is in 1913 the time period of 
the movie but she says she will support the democratic nominee 
medved said the haydens face a catch 22 with the jackson 
issue if he and miss fonda support jackson they risk offending 
haydens largely jewish west los angeles constituency if the 
couple does not support jackson hayden could find himself at odds 
with his political leader assembly speaker willie brown who is 
jacksons national campaign manager and with his longtime seatmate 
in the assembly chambers assemblyman tom bates who is cochairman 
of jacksons california campaign 
another observer john emerson an official in the los angeles 
city attorneys office who was deputy campaign manager of gary 
harts first 1988 presidential campaign said jackson is not really 
the issue 
most of the people in hollywood both the executives and 
celebrities were either committed to gary hart or sen joe 
biden both those campaigns blew up there was a sense of not 
wanting to be burned again so they wanted to wait out the primary 
but they will throw themselves into the november presidential 
race said emerson who now supports dukakis 
ed asner is on the verge of supporting dukakis and telly 
savalas also likes him said mike mamakos spokesman for both stars 
conservative republicans in hollywood are few but the ones who 
are active are expected to work for bush including charlton heston 
he will be supporting bush but he wont make an announcement 
until after the nomination said hestons spokesman michael 
levine 
sylvester stallone also remains uncommitted but the toughguy 
star of the rocky and rambo series did vote for mr 
reagan whom he admires greatly said stallones spokesman paul 
block he hasnt declared yet but i will say that mr stallone 
is a republican 
gov michael dukakis will easly beat out jesse jackson in the 
hollywood fundraising race leading up to the california primary 
block said while hollywood is overwhelmingly democratic and 
liberal there will also be considerable support for vice president 
george bush

government environmental regulations are 
having an impact on the lives of virtually all americans and are 
especially affecting farmers and the way they handle soil and water 
resources 
farmers should be helped to use the tremendous stream of 
technology coming out of laboratories to work within the 
regulatory world says jim spitz chairman of the agriculture 
departments new working group on agricultural chemicals and the 
environment 
the usda historically has operated worldclass research 
facilities it still does as the records attest but in recent 
decades the private sector has often been on the cutting edge of 
change leaving usda to basic research and longrange development 
meanwhile as americans become more conscious of the natural 
environment and how it can be affected by manmade chemicals and use 
of resources new restrictions emerge from local state and federal 
regulators 
it is high time many say that usda assert its leadership role 
and help teach farmers to work within the new system that will 
guide them tomorrow like it or not 
we need to move more aggressively as a department in 
technology spitz said in an interview what weve got to do is 
move on our technology and our ability to guide producers 
instead of saying you cant do this you cant do that well 
have to say heres the setting and heres what you can do 
heres the technology that you need to continue to operate 
the usda cant afford to stand on the sidelines he said the 
department and the network of landgrant universities and 
experiment stations represent a major force a major player in 
the environmental technological revolution at hand 
if were looking at cropland and production agriculture and 
these regulations are closing in on that we really must upgrade 
our technology and our capability to respond spitz said 
but isnt a lot of technology already available to farmers 
making it easier for them to abide by the new state and federal 
environmental restrictions 
in some of the newer technologies integrated pest 
management biotechnology in genetics and in some of the farming 
practices themselves theres quite a bit coming out of applied 
research he said we need to get it out into the demonstration 
areas and on farms so its visible to the american producer 
so its a rather old and familiar story at least in the research 
establishment the state and county extension service and among 
innovative farmers themselves if it works and can make money 
itll catch on 
if its going to be accepted profit is the bottom line 
spitz said 
the usda group that spitz heads was formed in early february 
among its purposes is to review usda policies regarding 
agricultural chemicals and report on the effectiveness and 
appropriateness of those policies 
another goal will be to develop appropriate strategies for 
carrying out new or amended policies relating to farm chemicals and 
the environment 
deputy secretary peter c myers spitzs boss and usdas second 
in command told a house subcommittee last week that the 
departments agricultural research service has adopted two new 
groundwater strategies for pesticides and nitrates 
in the case of pesticides myers said the agency plan calls for 
specific areas of research including the use of minimum or 
conservation tillage practices computer models to help select the 
best farm management practices integrated pest management 
improved pesticide application water and pesticide management for 
irrigated or poorly drained cropland and new technologies for 
pesticide analysis and decontamination 
myers told the house panel that the strategic plan for nitrates 
recognizes the important role nitrogen fertilizers play in modern 
agriculture and provides a balanced approach that allows their 
continued use in crop production in a manner that minimizes the 
movement of nitrogen into ground water 
environmental advocates have often criticized heavy fertilizer 
use as a source of pollution from water running off fields into 
streams 
myers said usda conservation programs also have elevated water 
quality into a top priority the 1985 farm law he said set up the 
longterm conservation reserve program or crp for converting 
highly erodible cropland to protective grass or trees for 10 years 
the crp and other provisions will significantly reduce 
sediment from cropland that previously entered the nations streams 
and rivers myers said it has been estimated that sediment 
pollution from cropland can be reduced as much as 30 to 40 percent 
annually by these provisions 
further he said as sediment levels are lowered pesticides and 
nutrients attached to those particles will be reduced

despite repeated setbacks the 
african national congress presses on with military and underground 
efforts to unseat the apartheid government some of its new 
guerrilla recruits are young whites 
there is a continuing trend of young welleducated liberal 
and leftwing whites to identify themselves with the anc said 
tom lodge a political scientist at the university of the 
witwatersrand and an expert on the anc 
increasingly he added the whites see the organization as a 
legitimate and morally admirable political force 
police say they have seized anc whites with caches of arms 
arrested another in a car bombing and charged at least one with 
treason 
but anc military activities have diminished 
in the past year bombings in south africa have declined police 
have claimed major breakthroughs against anc guerrillas and even 
the organizations leaders have conceded that its military actions 
were more effective during the widespread unrest of 198486 
anc guerrillas generally operate in small groups and have little 
hope of scoring conventional victories against south africas 
powerful security forces however the anc says its bombing and 
sabotage campaign remains an essential element of its multipronged 
strategy to oust the whiteled government 
we must step up our attacks on the police the army and other 
personnel associated with the institution government anc 
president oliver tambo said in march in neighboring blackgoverned 
zimbabwe we will strike against its economic infrastructure and 
do much more intensively what we have been doing all the time 
however the talk has not been matched by action 
two years ago the anc was claiming that it had enough popular 
support in south africa to direct a peoples power campaign 
that would make the country ungovernable 
but since the government imposed a nationwide state of emergency 
in june 1986 black unrest has dwindled from daily outbursts across 
the country to sporadic isolated incidents anc activity has 
declined simultaneously 
fifty bombings were reported in the first year of the emergency 
but only about 20 in the past 11 months police say that since the 
beginning of 1987 they have killed 54 suspected anc members and 
captured 525 inflicting major setbacks to anc operations inside 
south africa 
terrorists who are sent to the republic south africa are 
going on suicide missions because confrontation with the security 
forces means either certain death or a long period of 
imprisonment said adriaan vlok the governments law and order 
minister 
however the recent defeats do not appear to have hampered the 
ancs ability to recruit members into its military wing known as 
umkhonto we sizwe spear of the nation 
people dont join the anc if they are worried about 
setbacks said tom sebina a spokesman at anc headquarters in 
lusaka zambia people have joined and they continue to join 
because they are committed to our liberation struggle 
the anc refuses to say what its membership is but it is 
variously estimated at 4000 to 10000 men with military training 
most of whom are in camps in tanzania and angola no more than a 
few hundred are believed to be inside south africa 
whites always have had some role in anc political activities 
some of them in its upper echelons but spokesman sebina said the 
involvement of young whites has been growing in the 1980s though 
he declined to give any figures 
when police arrested four whites may 8 at a farmhouse outside 
pretoria they claimed their largest arms seizure ever the whites 
had a sovietmade sam7 groundtoair missile limpet mines hand 
grenades machine guns mortars and explosives the police said 
the leading suspect in a car bombing that killed three people 
march 17 is a 24yearold white man whose father is a university 
journalism professor 
in cape town jenny schreiner a 31yearold white whose father 
is a university administrator is on trial with 12 black 
codefendants charged with treason and terrorism 
the government portrays the anc as a communistled terrorist 
group that kills civilians and lacks widespread support and 
political legitimacy 
the conviction that the anc is conducting a futile struggle is 
already taking root in the their ranks said vlok the law and 
order minister 
the government also claims the anc is torn by internal strife 
that numerous of its defectors have joined the south african police 
force and that the anc keeps its dissidents in at an inhuman 
detention camp in northern angola 
sebina denied those claims 
he said south african agents not internal anc feuding were 
behind the six killings this year of anc officials living outside 
south africa he disclaimed any knowledge of recent defections by 
ranking anc members and said the organization did not maintain 
detention camps for dissidents 
the government has been making similar noises for a long 
time said sebina they said our back was broken when we were 
outlawed in 1960 they said the same thing when nelson mandela 
was arrested in 1962 one or two defeats will not end our 
struggle 
mandela the anc leader at the time of his arrest is in prison 
but remains a rallying point for the organization and the large 
majority of blacks 
founded in 1912 as a black rights movement the anc took up arms 
in 1961 the year after it was banned saying it was left with no 
alternative 
it is the largest black group fighting the government and it is 
widely believed that the anc would win national elections if the 
countrys 26 million blacks were allowed to vote 
the anc has offices in many african nations as well as eastern 
and western europe in hopes of advancing its political fortunes 
the anc has been drawing up a new set of guidelines for a 
postapartheid constitution that is reported to be their most 
detailed political document ever 
the weekly mail newspaper of johannesburg said the proposal 
calls for a mixed economy a bill of rights and a multiparty 
government it also calls for equalizing wealth a sensitive issue 
in a country where blacks make up about 75 percent of the 
population but own less than 2 percent of the countrys fixed 
assets 
the most contentious issue involving the anc remains its use of 
violence the government says it wont talk to the anc until it 
lays down its arms the anc says the arms are necessary to bring 
the government into genuine negotiations 
there has been no reassessment of the armed struggle said 
sebina there are still bombs exploding here and there and im 
sure there will be more of them

radisa petrovic a farmers son left 
this sleepy village for college 10 years ago with dreams of a 
normal life having a car and an apartment in the city 
what he didnt know then however was that his countrys 
economy would falter under the weight of heavy borrowing bad 
investment and a mounting debt 
today he is back on the farm one of millions of young yugoslavs 
forced to depend on their parents for economic survival 
petrovic 30 who married a law student at the university in 
nearby belgrade now is driving his fathers old sovietmade car 
his wife tanja has joined more than 1 million yugoslavs who 
are out of work staying at home with an 18monthold daughter 
instead of defending court cases 
as an agrarian manager on a staterun pig farm petrovic earns 
an aboveaverage 370000 dinar 250 a month 
it doesnt go far in an inflation of 170 percent and an economy 
burdened by a 21 billion foreign debt the communist government is 
strapped to pay 
my monthly salary lasts three days joked petrovic twenty 
if im really economical after that papa must come with his 
money 
the petrovics rarely eat out the traditional vacation on the 
adriatic will happen this year only if a relative lends them a 
seaside home and the couple finds the money to repair the soviet 
car 
on the surface life in yugoslavia sometimes seems blissfully 
untouched by the economic woes 
bars and cafes in belgrade the capital are always full the 
young dress with style cars and western gadgets are conspicuous 
behind that facade however living standards have dropped 
onethird since 1980 when yugoslavs thought they had something to 
look ahead to 
the inflation that premier branko mikulic has called a 
destructive evil is eating away at the fragile infrastructure of a 
nation constantly troubled by ethnic tensions among peoples divided 
in six different republics and using two different alphabets roman 
and cyrillic 
many of yugoslavias 23 million citizens depend for survival on 
the only structures left intact the traditional bonds between 
family and friends and ageold ties to the land 
people who live with their parents live much better than those 
who dont petrovic told a visitor being dependent on your 
parents you have a chance to sit in a car live a bit normally if 
you separate forget a car forget a tv forget everything 
the 300 families of skobalj are relatively well off on the 
fertile land along the danube southeast of belgrade but even they 
say times are getting hard and they angrily criticize the 
communist hierarchys policy of curbing farming output 
this is the worst situation i can remember said borivoje 
stojadinovic 65 who has farmed here all his life 
sitting out on his porch sipping coffee with visitors 
stojadinovic recalled selling a bull in 1938 for 4000 dinars 
you could have bought half the village he said 
now 4000 dinars is barely worth 3 
a decade ago stojadinovic added the sale of a bull provided 
his home with a refrigerator and washing machine 
now he added id need two bulls one for each 
he and his wife radmila 62 sold two of their 17 acres of land 
years back to finance the education of their two daughters one now 
a doctor and the other an engineer in different serbian cities 
both are married but both still depend on their increasingly 
frail parents to survive 
i cant send money the father said but just the other 
day i sent one of them a nice fat pig 
the stojadinovics would like to lease out land they cant farm 
for extra cash down the lane dusan pantic would like to rent it 
to graze his prizewinning cows and expand the farm he runs with 
his wife and son 
but the rent pantic would be able to pay wouldnt cover taxes 
and other state levies stojadinovic said communist authorities 
curb expansion for successful farmers like pantic forbidding any 
peasant to farm more than 25 acres of land 
former university student petrovic sitting at the kitchen table 
of his fathers farmhouse railed against such rules 
they should take a look at what the western world did with 
agriculture he said a prize cow in yugoslavia he added yields 
less than one quarter of the milk of an average cow in the united 
states 
ninety percent of yugoslavias agriculture is in the hands of 
private farmers like petrovics father 
but there are no good stimulating measures for private 
producers here petrovic said advocating new measures to create 
bigger more efficient farms 
like many other reforms in yugoslavia planned improvements in 
farming have run awry petrovic cited a plan to give loans to 
farmers whose investments yield slow returns and who must sell 
produce to the state at prices that lag behind inflation 
the wrong people got the credits petrovic said they have 
nothing to do with agriculture and just use the money to build 
houses and buy cars 
asked why petrovic flashed the knowing smile of someone 
accustomed to a nation where connections and power open doors 
we have some strange laws he said the law here is not a 
law if there are no exceptions 
a few miles up river in the village of grocka the wealth of 
local officials is on show mercedes cars sit in the driveways of 
their weekend homes and in the parking lot of a local restaurant 
favored by the late president josip broz tito 
the only other people not suffering around skobalj are those who 
went off to work in the west like a million other yugoslavs and 
have returned to build brick houses 
most of the people who went abroad in earlier years were poor 
and uneducated petrovic said they went because of the hard 
economic situation for them now they are coming back richer and 
cleverer than all the people left here 
he said a schoolfriend went to france years ago to play handball 
now he drives a porsche

when an assassin took robert f kennedys 
life 20 years ago robbing the nation of a rising leader he also 
stole the father from 11 children the oldest 16 the youngest not 
yet born 
while drugs and other personal tragedies have torn at some of 
their lives destroying one many of the children of robert and 
ethel kennedy have gone on to embrace their fathers ideals and 
pick up his torch of public service 
this is how theyre dealing with their fathers death said 
david f powers curator at the john f kennedy library in boston 
and a longtime kennedy family friend 
they think public service is the way they have the same 
compassion for the underprivileged that their father had they 
care 
the kennedy children remember their father for his dedication to 
the country his sense of discipline his love for life 
i remember when my uncle john kennedy died one of the 
family rituals was discussing current events and we often had to 
write something about what was taking plce on the front pages of 
the papers recalled michael kennedy 30 the sixth of the rfk 
children 
i remember my father turning to my older siblings and telling 
them to write down the significance of this event on the united 
states and history that must have taken a tremendous amount of 
selfdiscipline for such a personal event yet we always had 
going skiing rafting just so many fun times as well 
thinking about raising my own family these are the thoughts 
that go through your mind said michael who with his wife 
victoria a daughter of sports commentator frank gifford has three 
children 
his sisters and brothers are kathleen kennedy townsend 36 
joseph p kennedy iii 35 robert f kennedy jr 34 courtney 
kennedy ruhe 31 kerry kennedy 28 christopher kennedy 24 max 
kennedy 23 douglas kennedy 21 and rory kennedy 19 david 
kennedy was 28 when he died in 1984 
michael who like his father attended harvard and the university 
of virginia law school runs citizens energy corp the nonprofit 
oil company started by brother joe to help the poor get lowcost 
heat 
growing up in my family it was clear that you had to give 
something back not only to your family and your community but 
your country whether that came directly from my father or as much 
from my mother i guess its a basic christian attitude michael 
said 
he took over citizens energy after joe two years ago won the 
massachusetts congressional seat once held by their uncle jack and 
their grandfather michael was a fundraiser for the campaign 
rep kennedy has been asked by his mother to deliver the eulogy 
at a memorial mass on monday at rfks gravesite at the arlington 
national cemetery said aide chuck mcdermott kennedy refused 
repeated requests for an interview he and his wife sheila rauch 
have twins 
ethel kennedy presides over the family estate hickory hill 
located in this washington suburb and has organized memorials she 
generally prefers to have her children speak for the family 
daughter kathleen a maryland lawyer said her father believed 
that politics is an honorable profession and i think thats why so 
many of his children are interested in politics he believed that 
we should each do our best he had a sense of justice and 
injustice and if things were wrong one should not just sit idly 
by but do something about it 
she said she will likely run for office again following her 1986 
congressional defeat to a republican incumbent meanwhile she 
directs a community service program for high school students at the 
maryland department of education chairwoman of the robert f 
kennedy memorial foundation she is married to professor david 
townsend and they have three children 
kerry kennedy a boston college law school graduate was field 
director of her brothers 1986 campaign earlier this year she 
created the robert f kennedy center for human rights at the 
foundation to work on projects with the winners of the foundations 
annual human rights awards 
it is a way she said of carrying forth the ideals of the 
winners and the ways that they shared my fathers vision which 
she described as one of love and compassion and justice 
 
the center sent a delegation to south korea earlier this year to 
meet with human rights leaders and government officials among 
other planned projects are a series of medical clinics in poland 
my father believed in action kerry said 
shes leaving her position as treasurer of her brothers 
campaign to courtney kennedy ruhe who lives in manhattan with her 
husband of eight years david ruhe 
not all of robert kennedys children have entered public 
service and some have been crushed by tragedy 
the slaying of rfk totally devastated the family but struck 
at the oldest boys the hardest said david horowitz coauthor of 
the kennedys an american drama 
in april 1984 an overdose of painkillers tranquilizers and 
cocaine killed david kennedy who some say was alone in a hotel 
room watching news reports the night his father was gunned down 
june 5 1968 
robert f kennedy jr pleaded guilty to heroin possession in 
1983 received a twoyear suspended sentence and spent time in a 
drugtreatment center 
today he is an environmental law attorney in new york and is 
teaching at pace university kennedy and his wife of six years 
emily black also a lawyer have two children a foundation

porsche placed first in an annual survey naming 
the 10 most troublefree cars while three general motors corp 
models made the list two of them for the first time 
the jd power and associates car quality survey was mailed to 
75000 owners of new 1988 model cars purchased in november and 
december and asked for the number of problems experienced during 
the first 90 days the survey results were announced thursday 
more than 30000 owners answered the 1988 survey said bruce 
johnson senior project director for the agoura hills calif 
consulting firm 
the results porsche topped the list of most troublefree cars 
with 111 problems reported per 100 cars porsche cars came in sixth 
in 1987 
bumped to the second spot by porsche was mercedesbenz a fellow 
west german automaker whose owners reported 115 problems per 100 
cars in 1988 up from 108 in 1987 when it placed first 
toyota and nissan tied for third place with 122 problems per 100 
cars an improvement for both in 1987 nissan was third with 125 
problems and toyota was fourth with 129 
hondas upscale acura line slipped to fifth in 1988 from second 
in 1987 owners reported 138 problems per 100 cars in 1988 up from 
117 in 1987 
daihatsu which ranked as the sixth most troublefree car 
barely made it into the 1988 survey johnson said because the 
company began selling cars in the united states in december 
daihatsu owners reported 141 problems per 100 cars 
gms cadillac with 143 problems per 100 cars was seventh while 
buick with 153 was eighth and oldsmobile with 157 placed ninth 
cadillac and oldsmobile made the list for the first time since jd 
powers began the survey in 1985 
no american models made the list in 1987 
hondas other lines fell to no 10 with 158 problems per 100 
cars compared to the 130 problems that put the company in fifth 
place in 1987 
mazda subaru bmw and mitsubishi which ranked seventh through 
10th in 1987 did not make the list this year jd powers reports 
only the top 10 rankings and in 1987 it announced the number of 
trouble reports for only the top five cars 
we discovered there is a relationship between customer 
satisfaction and the problems that owners experience johnson 
said 
he said results of the shortterm car quality survey have been 
mirrored in the jd power customer satisfaction index a rating of 
dealers produced by surveying owners 12 months after their purchase 
the csi is important to auto dealers because auto manufacturers 
use it to determine which dealers receive hot new models new car 
lines or even new brands 
dealers have complained that the csi reflects problems with 
vehicles more than problems with dealers making dealers suffer for 
manufacturers mistakes 
johnson said both dealer and vehicle quality play in the csi 
ratings 
the more problems the more pressure on the dealer to fix the 
car he said adding that previous survey shows about 50 percent 
of the problems customers bring back to dealerships are repaired

the cable television industry will contribute 
about 32 billion to the gross national product during 1988 and 
provide some 490000 jobs a report commissioned by a cablerelated 
company says 
the study was done by browne bortz amp coddington inc a denver 
research firm after being commissioned by bill daniels chairman 
of daniels amp associates a major cable tv financial services 
company based in denver 
the study updated a 1986 report prepared by the same company 
which also was sponsored by daniels 
the cable industry in the united states has continued to grow 
rapidly over the past two years with annual revenue now around 
128 billion a 243 percent increase since 1986 the report said 
the industry provides 87600 direct jobs and cablerelated work 
provides an additional 60000 jobs another 340000 jobs are 
created indirectly according to he report 
cablerelated employment expanded at a lower rate than either 
economic output or employee income during that time and the report 
concluded that economic output per employee increased over the 
past two years resulting in fewer employees per dollar of economic 
output 
the study said cable came of age during the late 1980s with half 
of all us households now subscribing to cable service 75 percent 
of the subscribers now have access to 30 or more program channels 
15 percent have access to 54 or more 
cableoriginated programming makes up almost 40 percent of 
viewing in the average cable home the report said while viewing 
of networkaffiliated broadcast stations dropped 12 percent in the 
past five years 
our country is in the midst of a communications revolution 
daniels said during this decade all media and communications 
industries grew rapidly but cable television has been the star 
performer 
the study said that in revenue terms cable television ranks 
ahead of motion picture box office radio home video and broadcast 
network advertising

in an unprecedented move federal regulators 
ordered the makers of the antiacne medicine accutane to warn 
customers of potential birth defects by using a picture of a 
deformed baby on the drugs packaging 
it is an attempt to emphasize to people that were not talking 
about a remote risk of some minor birth defect but a very high 
risk of extremely severe birth defects that can in effect make 
the child unable to function says us food and drug 
adminstration spokesman william grigg 
among other requirements the fda will force female patients to 
sign a consent form stating they understand the risks associated 
with the powerful drug according to carolyn r glynn a 
spokeswoman for the drugs manufacturer hoffmanla roche of nutley 
grigg says the requirements were prompted by 62 reported cases 
of birth defects caused by the drug since it was introduced in 
1982 though the fda believes the actual number is much higher the 
fda says the risk of a pregnant accutane user having a deformed 
child is one in four or greater 
the requirements follow a recommendation by an fda advisory 
panel of outside experts that the prescription drug remain on the 
market it is considered the only effective treatment for severe 
scarring acne 
grigg said the requirement that hoffmanla roche include a 
photograph of an infant deformed by the drug was unprecedented 
ms glynn said the company basically agrees with the fdas 
order which does not stray much from the advisory panels 
recommendations but hoffmanla roche believes the photo may be 
more appropriate to use on the patient consent materials 
signed in the doctors office 
its not an issue of using the picture its where you use the 
picture she said 
the spokeswoman said hoffmanla roche received the fdas 
requirements wednesday in a letter dated may 19 the fda left it to 
hoffmanla roche to release the order or keep it confidential she 
said the company released the letter thursday 
grigg said thursday that theres still some negotiating room 
if hoffmanla roche seeks to alter some of the requirements 
the advisory panel and the fda embraced a proposal by hoffmanla 
roche to sell accutane only in a package in which explicit patient 
warnings including a sketch of a pregnant woman with a red x 
through it would be sealed under clear plastic at the factory to 
make sure the patient would see them 
ms glynn said the company which must respond to the fdas 
letter within 15 days hopes to have the patient consent kit on the 
market by late june and have the socalled blister packaging in 
drug stores no later than september 
the company also will pay the costs of birth control counseling 
and pregnancy tests for women who use the drug she said 
since its introduction accutane has carried specific and 
explicit warnings about the high risk that it will cause birth 
defects if taken during pregnancy 
those warnings were strengthened in recent years but the fda 
grew concerned that too many women and perhaps doctors were 
ignoring them 
most of the 62 birth defects reported to the fda including 
disfiguring facial deformitites severe mental retardation and 
heart defects occurred in the first two years of the medicines 
use when the warnings were less severe many of the children died 
within a year of birth grigg said 
though the advisory panel concluded the benefits of accutane 
outweighed its risks some government and health experts called for 
a total ban on the drug

a proposed treaty that would remove most 
tariff barriers between the united states and canada probably would 
increase trade between the two countries but leave some us 
industries at a competitive disadvantage a private study says 
the study by the northeastmidwest institute a research group 
established by members of congress found that the impact of the 
proposed agreement likely would be uneven with some industries 
gaining and others losing 
the report released thursday said that the automotive and 
textile industries would be the big losers under the treaty now 
being considered by committees in the house and senate 
in both the automobile and textile industries canadian tariffs 
would be retained during a phaseout period stretching up to 10 
years making it harder for us industries to compete the study 
said the treaty also would allow canada to establish new barriers 
in the textile sector the study noted 
on the other hand the study said industrial machinery 
electronics and energyintensive industries in the united states 
would benefit from the agreement in part because of already low 
canadian tariffs or more rapid removal of duties under the treaty 
the stakes are high for northeastern and midwestern states 
where about 72 percent of total trade between the two countries 
occurs the study said 
about half the 2 million us jobs that are dependent upon 
exports to canada are located within 12 states nine of them in the 
northeastmidwest region the study said 
in 1986 canadian exports to the region totaled 49 billion 
which was about 72 percent of all canadian shipments to the united 
states the study said the region exported 33 billion in goods 
and services to canada representing about 73 percent of all us 
shipments to canada 
the study found that new england states would benefit from 
improved access to cheap canadian hydroelectric power and a better 
chance to compete in the service sector 
the midatlantic states new york in particular would benefit 
from lower prices for canadian raw materials but would be hurt by 
the continuation of canadian restrictive technical standards for 
telecommunications equipment the study said 
the midwest michigan in particular would be hurt by continued 
barriers that give canada a competitive edge in the automotive 
industry the study said however lower raw material costs would 
increase the manufacturers ability to be price competitive in 
world markets the study said 
the northeastmidwest institute serves senators and 
representatives of 18 states connecticut delaware illinois

dissidents are suing the teamsters union over 
its acceptance of a new nationwide contract with the trucking 
industry despite rejection of the accord by 635 percent of voting 
affected members 
teamsters for a democratic union a detroitbased dissident 
faction with ties to consumer advocate ralph nader filed suit 
thursday in us district court here seeking to nullify the 
ratification vote earlier this month and prevent the new labor 
contract from going into effect 
the suit claims a 1961 provision in the unions constitution 
requiring a twothirds vote for authorizing a strike was illegally 
interpreted as negating the need for a yes majority to accept 
the new threeyear accord 
this conclusion of the ibt international brotherhood of 
teamsters that onethird of the involved members may approve a 
contract and compel their fellow workers to be bound by it is a 
plain violation of the ibt constitution the suit said 
even if such an interpretation were valid it added the union 
illegally attempted to obtain ratification by gerrymandering the 
electorate to deny the franchise to many members covered by the 
agreement while giving ballots to many other members not covered 
and refusing to count many ballots 
the teamsters announced a week ago that it was accepting the new 
national master freight agreement covering some 200000 workers 
nationwide even though the ratification vote was 64101 to 36782 
against it 
it was the first time in the unions history that a majority of 
voting rankandfile drivers and warehouse workers covered by the 
agreement had rejected a contract negotiated by teamster leaders 
since the constitution requires that the final offer be 
accepted as a result of failure to reject by twothirds vote any 
strike or work stoppage will be a violation of the agreement and 
have serious consequences jack yager the chairman of the 
unions negotiation committee said in a statement 
yager said 57 percent of the ballots mailed out were not 
returned indicating those members were satisfied with the offer 
if not they would have cast ballots rejecting the contract he 
said 
however he and other teamster officials have acknowledged the 
widespread dissension over the accord and are seeking to reopen 
talks with the industrys chief bargaining arm trucking management 
inc 
according to leaders of the dissident faction and other local 
teamster leaders the opposed provisions include measures requiring 
drivers to pay for excess insurance premiums based on their 
accident records and damaged freight or equipment if gross 
negligence is proved 
widespread rankandfile opposition also was voiced to a measure 
in which workers would be required to give up 15 percent of their 
pay if 75 percent of the affected employees of a losing company 
approved the concession 
chip roth a spokesman for the union said no officials were 
available to comment on the suit which was filed late thursday 
afternoon 
the new contract provides annual 35centanhour wage gains over 
the next three years raising the current base rate for truck 
drivers from 1471 an hour to 1506 an hour retroactive to april

the government is proposing modifications to 
older boeing 737s to help the aging aircraft stand up against the 
corrosion and crack problems discovered after the breakup of an 
aloha airlines jet last month 
the federal aviation administration on thursday issued two 
proposed airworthiness directives designed to serve as 
longterm solutions to the structural problems identified after a 
20foot section of the aloha plane tore away during flight on april 
28 
while some ongoing intensified inspections would be required 
under the proposed rules airlines could avoid even more intensive 
and costly inspections once they completed the modifications 
were giving the airlines what we call a terminating action 
something they can do so they dont have to continue to do these 
very expensive repetitive inspections faa spokesman fred farrar 
said of the proposed modifications 
the rules cover in varying degrees the first 464 of the 737s 
built but only an estimated 100 of those aircraft now are being 
operated by us airlines 
the repairs were expected to take about 2000 work hours per 
plane with the total cost for work on the 100 planes operated by 
us carriers estimated at 8 million 
this proposal is prompted by reports of numerous cracks found 
during inspections of airplanes that have accumulated more than 
40000 landings one of the faa proposals states this 
condition if not corrected could result in rapid decompression of 
the airplane 
the aloha jetliner was 19 years old and had made nearly 89000 
landings 
the proposed modifications would involve using rivets rather 
than bonding agents to attach metal tear strips that join pieces of 
the fuselage they also would require the replacement of certain 
countersunk rivets with larger rivets that have protruding heads 
the heads of countersunk rivets are set at or below the surface 
into which they are driven 
the countersunk rivets are suspected of having caused small 
cracks in the skin of the plane that could grow and eventually join 
into one large crack the faa said 
the faa reported on tuesday that a special inspection of 96 
older boeing 737s had revealed small cracks in one of every nine 
aircraft but not of a magnitude to cause alarm the inspection is 
ongoing 
farrar said the new rules were aimed at stopping the cause of 
the cracks in the first place 
were fairly certain that most of the cracks that were 
concerned with came from the fact that there were countersunk 
rivets he said 
the proposed rules are subject to public comment until july 24

at least 64 production companies signed 
independent contracts with the writers guild of america as union 
members claiming they had split management ranks gathered to 
decide whether to accept the agreements 
six more producer requests for contracts were turned in to union 
officials by thursday night when approximately 1500 guild writers 
met at the hollywood paladium to cast their votes east coast 
members of the guild cast ballots thursday night in new york 
the results of the voting were to be announced this afternoon 
union spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said here 
the 9000member guild claimed the contracts effectively split 
management ranks among the makers of such hit productions as the 
cosby show and the tonight show 
the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
representing the industrys biggest producers downplayed the 
defections which represent the first significant break in the 
12week strike that has forced delays in the start of the fall tv 
season 
were anticipating ratification ms rhoden said before the 
meeting we see it strategically as a good move at this time to 
break the logjam with the alliance 
meanwhile negotiators for both the alliance and the guild 
agreed to meet in small groups saturday and in aother fulldress 
bargaining session tuesday 
among the terms in the threeyear independent contracts are a 35 
percent formula for foreign residuals and greater creative input 
two of the major points of contention with the alliance since the 
march 7 walkout 
the alliance is offering 103 percent for foreign residuals 
said spokesman herb steinberg residuals are the fees paid to 
writers when tv shows are rerun or movies reissued 
the list of 64 production companies released at the meeting 
includes the carseywerner company which produces two of the most 
popular shows on television the cosby show and its spinoff 
a different world 
the makers of the tonight show signed a contract and the 
producers of late night with david letterman have agreed to a 
contract but havent signed said union president george kirgo 
among the others to sign were producers of alf the muppets 
and highway to heaven 
steinberg said none of the 217 major producers that belong to 
the alliance has signed independent contracts large producers 
whose ranks include columbia pictures mtm and lorimar employ 80 
percent of the industrys writers and supply 84 percent of 
primetime tv shows he said 
the alliance producers are holding strong steinberg said 
our objective is to get this town back to work and get everybody 
working 
he estimated that the independent deals would only reemploy 
about 72 writers 
if theyre satisfied to put 72 writers to work and leave 4000 
out of work thats their choice he said 
they have no way to estimate that number ms rhoden 
responded they just pulled that out of thin air the way they do 
with all of their other figures

agricultural researchers are doing their own 
production of roots by inserting a tiny video camera into the 
soil to record the underground development of soybean plants 
the technique could help scientists understand how various 
tillage systems affect crop growth as well as when and where to 
apply fertilizer and pesticide 
i think it will work and it will be an important tool said 
mary ann levan a university of illinois researcher who worked on 
the project with us department of agriculture engineers john 
hummel and ken sudduth 
the 1 by 3inch video camera is guided down clear plastic tubes 
inserted in the bean rows and used to record root growth from a few 
inches to more than 3 feet below the surface 
its not very spectacular as movies go im afraid said 
hummel scanning one tape 
depth markers can be read on the inside of the tube and white 
soybean roots can be seen in the earth occasionally an insect 
moves into the frame to nibble on a root 
i saw a soybean beetle said levan the root was very 
prominent new large and white and there was the worm chewing 
through it it was real clear 
the tubes are inserted in the ground at an angle soon after 
planting so the soybean crop can be checked throughout the season 
in two previous seasons the focus has been on perfecting the 
technique 
without the video equipment scientists must remove cores of 
soil section them wash off the dirt and measure roots levan 
said that method does not allow observation of the same roots 
throughout the season she said 
hummel said the tiny camera actually was designed to inspect the 
inside of pipes in nuclear power plants 
in the ui study some soybeans being monitored are planted in 
undisturbed soil while others are planted after deep thorough 
plowing 
it also should be helpful for fertilizer placement because it 
tells you where the active roots are during the growing season 
said levan also you can observe insects that attack roots and 
see when they hatch and where they feed 
that might help scientists determine the best time and location 
for insecticides and it should help them compare the results of 
various products by watching them work in the soil the researchers 
said

rose 41 percent in the first four months of this year from its 
level of a year earlier the bank of korea reported friday 
the surplus in january through april was 389 billion up from 
276 billion dollars one year ago 
officials at the central bank said if the present pace 
continues the surplus is likely to top 10 billion by the end of 
the year above the record of 985 billion dollars last year 
the current account measuring trade in merchandise and 
services showed a surplus of 880 million in april down from 
125 billion in march but up from 650 million in april last year 
the officials said the decline from march was due largely to a 
slowdown in exports attributed to labor strikes and other factors 
which affected shipments particularly of automobiles and toys

major european airlines expect their 
profits will fall by about 16 percent this year after a dramatic 93 
percent jump in earnings in 1987 the association of european 
airlines said friday 
the aea which represents 22 major european carriers predicted 
the combined net profit of its members would fall to about 650 
million in 1988 from 775 million last year 
the airlines 1987 net profit was up 93 percent over the 400 
million reported in 1986 the aea said in a statement 
gross operating profit for the group was expected to fall to 
about 11 billion this year from a record 129 billion in 1987 
the aeas forecasts indicate airline profits would return to 
1985 levels 
the aea said growth in passenger traffic is expected to slow to 
about 7 percent this year from 13 percent in 1987 when traffic 
rebounded from a disastrous previous year 
traffic growth in 1987 was particularly strong on north atlantic 
routes which recorded a 19 percent increase however the aea said 
traffic on the route would rise only 6 percent this year because of 
the weak dollar 
seventeen out of the 22 aea members fly the north atlantic

gov mario cuomo who persuaded a long 
island utility to abandon a 53 billion nuclear plant still has 
to sell the deal to wall street bankers and a host of federal 
state and local officials 
cuomo who announced the tentative agreement on the shoreham 
nuclear plant thursday also wants the plant 55 miles east of 
manhattan dismantled but said there may be problems winning 
approval from the us nuclear regulatory commission 
i expect the nrc to do everything it can to kill us and open 
the plant the governor said i dont trust the nrc 
were not going to comment on that nrc spokesman frank 
ingram said today 
if the agreement with the long island lighting co goes through 
it would mark the first time a completed us nuclear plant was 
abandoned before opening for lilco which was driven to the edge 
of bankruptcy by the plant the deal averted a threatened takeover 
by the state 
the accord drew applause from shoreham opponents even though it 
concedes lilco a rate hike of more than 50 percent over the next 
decade to pay for the shutdown 
this makes my whole year said linda schantz who lives in 
the town of shoreham with her husband and two children 
but it was the latest bad news for the troubled nuclear 
industry more than 100 nuclear plants have been canceled since 
lilco began building shoreham in 1973 and no plants have been 
proposed in the last decade 
the pact is a bad agreement for the nation as a whole said 
edward m davis president of the american nuclear energy council 
an industry group in washington the agreement could threaten 
energy security as well as national security by increasing oil 
prices in the face of predicted brownouts in the northeast this 
summer 
cuomo said the plant must be torn down to prevent future state 
leadersfrom resurrecting it 
just mothballing it he told an albany news conference would 
be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storing it in the 
closet 
us rep george hochbrueckner whose district includes the 
plant agreed 
weve shown shoreham the cross but we have to put a stake 
through its heart he said 
however if the plant were dismantled the fuel rods would have 
to be disposed at a nuclear waste facility there are no facilities 
for highlevel commercial nuclear waste in the united states nrc 
spokesman frank ingram said earlier this month 
the shoreham project begun in 1965 ended up 10 years behind 
schedule and 80 times more expensive than predicted 
the plant was completed in 1984 but never opened because state 
and local officials refused to participate in preparing emergency 
evacuation plans arguing that long island couldnt be safely 
evacuated in a nuclear accident lacking such a plan the nrc 
refused to issue more than a lowpower testing license 
under the agreement lilco would pay to decommission the plant 
which cuomo aides said could cost 500 million while the state 
would buy it for a token dollar so that lilco can claim a tax loss 
cuomo said some details of the agreement remain to be worked 
out but insisted we have gotten everything we wanted 
shoreham has to die shoreham will die 
to make that happen the investment community must agree to 
refinance 2 billion worth of lilco debt at lower interest rates 
wall streets initial reaction was positive the price of lilco 
stock jumped nearly 14 percent thursday rising 1375 to 1138 in 
heavy trading 
the state public service commission must also agree to grant 
lilco 5 percent rate hikes for the next three years and set a goal 
of 5 percent increases a year for the following seven years 
lilcos nearly 1 million customers already pay the second 
highest power rates in the country second only to neighboring 
consolidated edison in the new york city area 
in addition the state legislature must give the new york power 
authority permission to build five nonnuclear generating plants on 
long island to ensure sufficient power for the area

aftertax incomes fell 09 percent in april 
the sharpest setback in a year as tax filings took a big bite out 
of americans disposable income the government reported today 
the commerce department said it was the first decline in 
disposable income since a 06 percent drop last november and the 
biggest decrease since a 25 percent decline in april 1987 when 
changes prompted by the new tax law took an even bigger bite out of 
americans incomes 
facing big tax bills americans cut back on spending last month 
as well personal consumption spending was basically flat in april 
following a 08 percent rise in march 
before adjusting for taxes personal income rose a weak 01 
percent in april following a 11 percent jump in march this 
performance was substantially below economists expectations 
many of them had been looking for a gain of around 06 percent 
based on the strong employment increase in april which pushed the 
jobless rate down to a 14year low of 54 percent 
the big decline in disposable incomes pushed americans savings 
rate savings as a percentage of disposable income down to 38 
percent last month compared to a rate of 47 percent in march 
the report said personal tax payments climbed at an annual rate 
of 362 billion in april compared to a march increase of 109 
billion most of that gain came in payments taxpayers had to make 
when they filed their returns before the april 15 deadline 
wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 79 billion in 
april down from a march increase of 15 billion reflecting 
primarily the fact that wages were boosted in march by a payment of 
bonuses to workers at ford motor co 
farm income fell 76 billion last month compared to an increase 
of 194 billion in march with federal subsidy payments accounting 
for the wide swing 
on the spending side purchases of durable goods fell by 43 
billion while purchases of nondurable goods dropped 141 billion 
purchases of services which include housing costs climbed 116 
billion

a computer whiz has pleaded guilty to 
conspiring to sell 4 million in stolen supercomputer technology to 
the soviet union 
kevin anderson of fremont admitted in federal court on thursday 
he took part in a scheme with three other people to sell the 
soviets plans to a system that allows computers to process as many 
as 1 billion instructions per second 
the technology had a restricted rather than classified status 
but could have proved damaging to us security if the soviets had 
received it according to the government 
the deal was broken up by government agents who infiltrated the 
scheme us attorney joseph russoniello said when arrests were 
made last year 
anderson pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate export laws and 
wire fraud based on his use of the telephone to defraud saxpy 
computer corp of sunnyvale from which the plans were stolen 
in exchange prosecutors dropped about a dozen other charges 
against the former software engineer at synthesized computer 
systems inc in santa clara 
anderson faces up to 15 years in prison and a fine of up to 
203 million at sentencing july 15 
the plea came two weeks before an extradition hearing in canada 
for charles mcvey an alleged conspirator in the scheme he is 
being held in vancouver british columbia 
ivanpierre batinic an engineer who once worked fr saxpy and 
his brother stevan also were charged in the case 
according to court documents anderson had planned to use an 
elaborate moneylaundering scheme involving liechtenstein banks to 
set up a computer business in dublin ireland after completing the 
sale to the soviets

tax filings took a big chunk from americans disposable income 
last month and compelled them to cut spending substantially the 
commerce department reported today 
it said aftertax incomes fell 09 percent in april the 
sharpest setback in a year and the first decline since a 06 
percent drop in november personal consumption spending was 
basically stagnant in april following a 08 percent rise in march 
the department said 
in april 1987 changes prompted by the new tax law took a bigger 
bite out of americans incomes and reduced their disposable income 
by 25 percent 
before adjusting for taxes personal income rose a weak 01 
percent in april following a 11 percent jump in march this 
performance was substantially below the expectations of many 
economists who have predicted strong economic growth this year 
evidence of that strong growth was reported thursday by the 
commerce department which said the gross national product grew at 
a surprisingly rapid annual rate of 39 percent in the first three 
months of the year 
the growth was much better than anticipated and came largely 
from surging exports higher auto sales and increased business 
capital investment 
you would have to say that not only was the stock market crash 
ignored but the economy thumbed its nose at it said robert 
dederick chief economist of northern trust co of chicago 
the report reflected a sharp upward revision from an initial 
estimate made a month ago that the gnp grew at a more modest 23 
percent rate in the first quarter 
it elated republicans who are hoping a record 66monthlong 
expansion since the last recession of 198182 will bolster 
prospects that vice president george bush will win the white house 
in the november election 
but to the stock and bond markets sensitive barometers of the 
economys future direction the gnp report was widely viewed as 
another signal that higher inflation is inevitable 
the inflation signal was substantiated by another government 
report thursday showing aftertax corporate profits rose only 05 
percent in the first quarter some economists suggested that meant 
companies will attempt to boost their profits by raising prices 
on wall street stocks gained only marginally thursday in light 
trading reflecting an apathy that has persisted for months the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 538 points to 196675 
after falling 116 the day before 
bond prices were mostly lower the key 30year treasury bond 
fell point or 250 for every 1000 in face value and its 
yield which moves inversely to its price climbed to 932 percent 
from 928 percent late wednesday 
many analysts have predicted that the federal reserve 
responsible for restraining inflation will push interest rates 
higher to dampen demand for credit the central bank has tightened 
credit twice in the past two months 
some said the fast gnp growth was an advance signal of a 1989 
recession despite white house assertions that the number harbored 
no bad news

grain and soybean futures opened higher on the 
chicago board of trade today on buying encouraged by forecasts for 
hot dry weather in the midwest through the memorial day weekend 
the volatile soybean market which fell wednesday and thursday 
surged at todays opening with most contracts up more than 12 
cents a bushel 
wheat also posted strong early gains while corn and oats were 
slightly higher 
although dry weather poses a real threat to the maturing winter 
wheat crop the runup in soybean corn and oat prices is largely 
speculative since those newly planted crops have not yet developed 
enough to sustain damage analysts said 
i dont think the crops are under stress but the traders are 
sure hot said steve freed an analyst in chicago with the 
investment firm dean witter reynolds inc 
recent trading patterns indicate soybean prices will continue to 
advance if the weather stays dry freed said 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 340 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 2 cents higher with july at 215 a bushel oats were 2 cents 
to 3 cents higher with july at 174 a bushel soybeans were 8 
cents to 13 cents higher with july at 766 a bushel

early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 02 cent lower to 35 cent higher with june at

the european economic community 
commission criticized the united states friday for cuts in required 
wheat setaside acreage which will take less land out of 
production this year than last 
there seems to be a fairly flagrant contradiction between what 
the us claims to do and what it is doing said a commission 
official who asked not to be named 
both the eec and the united states are using programs to take 
land out of production as a way to cut agricultural overproduction 
the united states had adjusted its support levels for wheat 
farmers by announcing earlier this week that they would have to cut 
planted acreage by only 10 percent this year in order to qualify 
for government subsidies 
last year they had been forced to cut acreage by 275 percent 
each year at this time the us administration announces price 
supports and acreage requirements for subsidies under various 
programs 
the eec spokesman said it remained determined to continue with 
its own setaside programs calling it unfortunate that washington 
was taking this action so soon before the midterm review of the 
uruguay round of the general agreement on tariffs and trade talks 
to be held at the end of this year 
the us administration has called for an end to all 
agricultural subsidies in both the united states and the 12nation 
eec by the year 2000 the trade bloc has criticized the goal as 
unrealistic

time and decided to mail ballots for his slate of candidates before 
the long memorial day weekend began 
in rejecting the offer the texaco board cited a number of 
factors they claimed undermined the seriousness of the bid they 
echoed managements sentiments in questioning whether icahn could 
arrange financing and said the 48hour deadline he imposed on the 
offer indicated he was not serious 
the board said it was confident texacos restructuring program 
would enhance shareholder value 
analysts were skeptical that texacos board would approve 
icahns offer 
i would be flabbergasted if texacos board agreed to icahns 
merger proposal said michael young who follows texaco for smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
he joined others in suggesting that the offer was doomed from 
the beginning and that icahn texacos largest shareholder was 
fully aware of that 
wall street remained unenthusiastic shares in the nations 
third largest oil company eased 50 cents to 4950 a share in 
afternoon trading on the new york stock exchange 
texaco and icahn battled it out in competing fullpage ads in 
selected newspapers today with texaco asking shareholders if they 
can trust the companys future to icahn and the takeover 
strategist urging them to take up his offer 
analysts suggested icahns real intention in making the bid was 
to push texacos stock price up as he continued his war of nerves 
against the management of the white plains nybased company 
icahns offer of 60 for each of texacos 243 million shares 
would value the company at 146 billion 
however under the offer he would have to pay out only 124 
billion for the 207 million shares he does not already own he paid 
an average 34 a share or about 122 billion for his existing 
stake of 36 million shares 
the combined total of 1364 billion would amount to the biggest 
sum ever paid in a corporate buyout the previous record was a 
134 billion acquisition of gulf corp by standard oil co of 
california now chevron corp in 1984 
texaco president james w kinnear in a statement released 
thursday reiterated his claim that icahns offer was bogus 
there is no basis to believe that mr icahn can arrange the 
financing for a transaction of approximately 20 billion 
including the purchase of the shares he doesnt own and the 
payment of debt and other obligations that would have to be 
satisified in connection with his proposal kinnear said 
when making the offer on wednesday icahn said he was so sure he 
could obtain financing that he would place 100 million in escrow 
and forfeit it to texaco if he failed to get commitments before the 
companys annual shareholders meeting next month subject to 
certain conditions 
the struggle has been escalating since last fall when icahn 
began building what has become a 148 percent stake in texaco 
today that stake is so large that he cannot sell it quickly 
and collect his profit without depressing its price on the market 
i think he wants somebody to bail him out said cliff 
haigler an analyst at the securities firm howard weil labouisse 
friedrichs inc in houston 
icahn revealed thursday that texaco recently found a buyer 
willing to pay 50 a share for his stake in the oil company but he 
rejected the offer because it smacked of greenmail 
texaco spokesman peter maneri said the claim is totally untrue 
and mr icahn knows it furthermore maneri said that if a 
50ashare offer had surfaced every indication we have is that 
icahn would have run through a brick wall to accept it 
in recent months icahn has been pressuring texacos management 
to take steps to raise the value of the companys stock if 
necessary by breaking it up and selling off the pieces 
he has backed up the demand by launching a proxy fight to 
install himself and four allies on texacos 14seat board 
texaco which emerged last month from a year under bankruptcy 
court protection responded by restoring its 3 annual dividend and 
expanding its planned asset sales to 5 billion from 3 billion 
wednesday afternoon company officials broke off three weeks of 
peace talks claiming icahn was making unreasonable demands for 
special treatment in the financial restructuring an icahn 
spokesman strongly denied the charge 
a few hours later icahn released a letter to texaco containing 
his offer he also said he would drop his threatened proxy contest 
if management would allow the other 211000 stockholders to 
consider the offer at the companys annual meeting next month

lower friday as the market largely ignored worsethanexpected

points or 009 percent lower at 17837 
volume totaled a slim 3465 million shares compared with

bumble bee seafoods inc to extend their merger agreement until 
june 3 while they consider the justice departments opposition to 
the deal 
the government announced thursday plans to block the proposed 
merger of two of the nations top three canned tuna brands the 
deal would give heinz half of the nations canned tuna sales worth 
about 1 billion per year 
the regulators rejected arguments by heinz that canned tuna is a 
commodity whose price is determined by the world market and that 
imports provide adequate competition through their 27 percent share 
of domestic sales 
heinz already owns topselling starkist bumble bee of san 
diego is third 
the justice department said the merger could reduce competition 
and allow heinz to hike prices on one of americas most popular

two exchanges that trade stockindex futures said 
friday they oppose the securities and exchange commissions bid to 
take over regulation of trading in the contracts 
its a grasp for power and it was certainly not a unanimous 
opinion by the sec board said andy yemma a spokesman for the 
chicago mercantile exchange this is not a new agenda and it 
predates the stock market crash 
in washington thursday the sec voted 32 in favor of taking 
over the regulation of stock index futures from its sister agency 
the commodity futures trading commission 
the shift in jurisdiction must be approved by congress 
sec chairman david ruder said studies since the oct 19 stock 
market collapse point to a need for one agency to oversee the 
trading of stocks and stockrelated products 
in chicago where most stockindex futures are traded officials 
at the merc and the chicago board of trade which also offers 
stockindex futures contracts quickly denounced the move and vowed 
to fight it stockindex futures also are traded by the kansas city 
board of trade and the new york futures exchange a subsidiary of 
the new york stock exchange 
we would strongly disagree with that said mike oconnell a 
spokesman for the chicago board of trade of the sec vote 
we feel that these markets should be regulated as they are by 
the cftc who during the week of oct 19 performed flawlessly in 
their duties he said 
oconnell and yemma contended that all trading in futures 
contracts whether they be a financial product like stockindexes 
or an agricultural product like soybeans should be regulated by 
the cftc 
even though the underlying product emanates from the stock 
exchange these are still futures contracts and we believe just as 
congress mandated they should be regulated by the commodity 
futures trading commission oconnell said 
yemma who said the mercs standard amp poors 500 index makes up 
75 percent of the market in stockindex futures trading echoed 
those sentiments 
the cftc is best equipped to regulate futures markets he 
said stock index futures are one product in a vast array of 
financial and agricultural futures which we offer and the other 
exchanges offer 
if you take stock index futures and move them to the sec where 
they would become simply one of many things the sec oversees we 
dont feel theres the expertise there to oversee them correctly 
yemma said 
he also said recent reports examining the causes of the stock 
crash have criticized the secs regulatory work but have not 
faulted the futures commissions job 
there have been efforts by certain members of congress and 
certain members of the sec to move regulation of stock index 
futures to the sec for years yemma said its basically 
politics and turf

gov bob martinez asked the federal 
government friday to delay oil and gas drilling off floridas 
southwest coast and the florida keys 
martinez wrote a letter to interior secretary donald hodel 
asking for more time to study potential environmental damage from 
any oil spills before any exploratory drilling is allowed 
the governor also said he would reject requests for permits to 
drill in areas leased by the interior department in 1984 and 1985 
if such activities threaten the keys or south florida 
it is critical that we have a detailed understanding of the 
currents in the eastern gulf of mexico and straits of florida to 
ensure the protection of the florida keys home of the nations 
only living coral reef and countless other irreplaceable 
resources martinez wrote 
the only permit request the governor has received so far is from 
union oil co of california which wants to drill as many as 23 
test wells north of the dry tortugas which are west of key west 
the republican governor also wrote a separate letter to 
floridas congressional delegation vowing to continue discussing 
the states opposition to offshore drilling with officials in the 
reagan administration he assured them he would take whatever 
actions are necessary to protect the keys and other sensitive 
coastal areas 
the letters dealt with an area south of naples to just north of 
the dry tortugas marquesas islands and the florida keys which was 
not included in a recent agreement by hodel to drop leasing plans 
for 11 million acres off floridas coasts 
it is an area of 73 lease blocks for which congress ordered a 
threeyear study before any drilling could be conducted 
a panel of 30 scientists assembled by martinez concluded that 
the federal environmental research was inadequate and more would be 
needed before potential detrimental impacts of such drilling on 
floridas environment and economy could be fully determined 
congress did not require any evaluation of the research results 
before drilling could be permitted 
eighteen of the 19 members of floridas congressional delegation 
have signed a letter to the house appropriations committee urging 
that a rider be attached to the interior departments appropriation 
to prohbit the expenditure of any money for leasing or drilling off 
floridas southwest coast ms whitfield said rep sam gibbons 
dtampa declined to sign 
the governor is concerned about what path an oil spill might 
take near the florida keys and the impact it might have on the 
coral reef mangroves and other natural resources 
his panel of scientists reported that existing studies lack 
information on where prevailing currents might carry an oil spill 
in the eastern gulf and straits of florida 
martinez also cited the failure of the federal studies to 
address all potential environmental and economic effects on 
nearshore and coastal resources

the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
refused friday to block a 197 million takeover bid for murray ohio 
manufacturing co by ab electrolux of sweden 
a threejudge panel said electrolux should not be penalized as 
murray asked because it had been represented by a new york law 
firm that once helped advise murray on how to fight a takeover 
the judges agreed that the law firm sullivan amp cromwell had a 
conflict of interest but they noted earlier testimony that no 
confidential information from murray was passed on to electrolux 
electrolux officials learned of the potential conflict of 
interest april 28 and switched to another adviser smith barney amp 
harris upham co inc the following day 
the appeals judges upheld a decision monday by us district 
thomas a wiseman who said he knew of no law permitting the 
court to enjoin the transfer of stock 
immediately after wiseman ruled electrolux increased its tender 
offer from 48 per share or 182 million to 52 per share or 
197 million 
murray stock rose 75 cents on the new york stock exchange friday 
to close at 6075 per share indicating wall street expects an 
even higher offer 
murray officials have asked shareholders not to accept the 
tender offer until they have reviewed it management promised a 
recommendation by june 7 two weeks before the offer was scheduled 
to expire 
two other lawsuits over the electrolux bid are pending 
one in chancery court in lawrenceburg tenn challenges the 
legality of murrays plan to increase its outstanding stock by 50 
percent a poison pill defense designed to make the cost of a 
takeover prohibitive 
another lawsuit in ohio was filed by electrolux to challenge 
murrays arguments that an ohio state law against hostile takeovers 
does not apply to murray murray ohio was incorporated in ohio in 
1919 as an auto parts manufacturer but moved its headquarters to 
suburban brentwood in 1955

274 million shares outstanding

british industrialist brian beazer and 
shearson lehman hutton inc faced a new barrier against their 
17billion hostile bid for koppers co when a federal judge in 
los angeles on friday summoned them to a contempt of court hearing 
june 6 
koppers filed papers thursday in us district court in los 
angeles accusing beazer and shearson of violating the courts order 
not to proceed with their 60pershare tender offer 
echoing allegations lodged previously in federal court here 
koppers complained that its suitors have continued to advertise for 
shareholder support and extend their tender offers expiration date 
koppers spokeswoman maggie cessar said us district chief judge 
manuel real filed the order friday in los angeles 
the pittsburghbased construction materials and chemicals 
company previously won federal injunctions in pittsburgh and los 
angeles blocking the tender offer on considerations of securities 
laws and antitrust laws respectively 
us district chief judge maurice cohill previously scheduled a 
june 6 hearing in pittsburgh to consider alleged violations of 
securities laws by bns inc the group headed by beazer and 
shearson koppers has charged bns with violating margin lending 
laws by offering preferred stock to shearson in return for a 540 
million loan 
in london friday beazers company beazer plc said it was 
asking its shareholders to authorize a guarantee for the loan 
beazer said it would issue the loan guarantee only if in closing 
the deal it did not have a merger agreement with koppers or it had 
less than 90 percent of koppers common and preferred shares
