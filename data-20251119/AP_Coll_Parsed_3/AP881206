the federal indictment of ptl founder jim 
bakker is the latest in a series of woes to befall tv evangelists 
since bakker first resigned amid a sex and hushmoney scandal a year 
and a half ago 
scandals rocking the industry have put a choke hold on 
contributions and many socalled televangelists are facing the 
harsh reality that financial support from the public could become 
increasingly harder to come by 
bakker left the fort millbased television ministry and christian 
theme park known as heritage usa in march 1987 after admitting to a 
sexual encounter with former new york church secretary jessica hahn 
bakker left ptl which had assets totaling 160 million with 
debts of as much as 130 million ptl entered federal bankruptcy 
reorganization proceedings in june 1987 
in may of that year the rev leroy jenkins offered to pay the 
bakkers a total of 175000 to perform on a weekly television show 
jenkins said his callin show and faithhealing services from his 
healing hill cathedral in delaware at the time were broadcast on 
about 20 radio stations 
jenkins had spent more than three years in prison for conspiracy 
to commit arson and assault and said his troubles motivated his 
offer to help the bakkers 
bakker and his top aide the rev richard dortch were defrocked 
later in 1987 by the assemblies of god a pentecostal charismatic 
denomination 
revelations of possible homosexual activities and accusations by 
the irs that the bakkers and top aides took nearly 15 million from 
the ministry in salaries and unjustified compensation seemed to 
serve as a catalyst for the crumbling of the electronic church 
less than a year after assemblies of god minister jimmy swaggart 
blasted bakker for his sexual indiscretions the louisiana 
evangelist was crying at the pulpit while he admitted that he had 
sinned against god and family 
the assemblies louisiana state hierarchy ordered swaggart to 
immediately begin a twoyear rehabilitation period that would limit 
his preaching and place him in counseling swaggart resigned from 
the assemblies of god church in april just as national church 
officials moved to defrock him 
another defrocked assemblies of god minister marvin gorman of 
suburban new orleans reportedly hired the men who photographed 
swaggart with a prostitute outside a motel 
even before bakker and swaggart oral roberts had made some 
question the credibility of tv ministers 
roberts who had built an evangelistic empire including a 
university and a hospital in tulsa okla told his followers that 
god might take me home if he failed to raise 8 million by the 
end of march 1988 
roberts also claimed to have raised several people from the dead 
the electronic churchs troubles led former republican 
presidential contender pat robertson chairman of the christian 
broadcasting network to say he resented being identified as a 
television evangelist 
robertson resigned as a southern baptist minister and as cbn 
chairman in october 1987 and stopped appearing as host on the 700 
club tv show 
audiences for televangelists began to dry up along with 
contributions 
roberts lost about 35 percent of his audience according to 
arbitron figures published in september the report showed roberts 
in july 1988 in the no 4 spot with 561000 households down from 
863000 a year earlier 
the arbitron report showed swaggarts audience dropped from the 
toprated spot in july 1987 to no3 in july 1988 with only half the 
previous audience his daily program dropped from 11th to 17th 
during the same period according to arbitron which measures 
viewership on commercial television stations 
swaggarts no1 shw a study in the word was replaced by a 
show whose host was robert schuller founder of the garden grove 
community church known for its crystal cathedral swaggarts show 
was seen by 119 million households in the summer of 1988 
schullers show was seen in 121 million households 
the rev jerry falwell whose lynchburg va ministry includes 
the oldtime gospel hour has said the credibility crisis is 
unbelievable 
published reports on nov 30 citing tax records showed 
contributions to falwells show had dropped by more than 10 million 
to 407 million and that the ministrys net worth has fallen by 
nearly 5 million from last year 
falwell who also founded the moral majority briefly stepped in 
to try to salvage ptl after bakker left 
contributions to ptl which at one time bulged to millions now 
barely manage to equal costs 
the national religious broadcasters tried to put the brakes on 
the downward slide in february when they adopted a financial and 
moral code of ethics it requires public disclosure of annual 
independent audits of all income and expenditures except for 
salaries the nrb claims 1350 member organizations 
billy graham considered the father of television evangelism 
apparently has managed to remain above the fracas and said his 
ministry continues to prosper amid the unholy hubbub

mexican president carlos salinas de gortari 
and cuban leader fidel castro are poles apart ideologically but 
they found a way to do each other some good last week 
the occasion was thursdays inauguration of salinas an economist 
who believes in individual effort and a smaller government 
all castro a fundamentalist of communism had to do was show up 
salinas opponents who maintain that his ruling institutional 
revolutionary party cheated to win the presidency were quick to 
note that the occasion marked the first time foreign heads of state 
had been invited to a presidential inauguration 
theyre desperately searching for support outside the country 
because they dont have any support inside the country said 
cuauhtemoc cardenas the leftist democratic front leader last week 
the salinas transition team said latin american heads of state 
were invited because those countries wanted to invite mexican 
presidents to their own inaugurations they said the invitations 
would encourage latin american unity 
those in the leftist opposition were especially disappointed that 
castro and president daniel ortega of nicaragua decided to come 
its up to them if they want to lend support to an illegitimate 
government cardenas said before the inauguration 
while salinas was able to undercut his opponents and bolster his 
own image castro saw a larger geopolitical significance in the 
invitation 
the fact that he was sitting in the same gallery with other heads 
of state and a galaxy of other dignitaries including us secretary 
of state george shultz was both a recognition of his nation and a 
symbol of triumph he said 
the us strategy of isolating cuba has failed he said at a 
weekend news conference we never came to an inauguration before 
because they didnt invite us but now ecuador and mexico have 
invited us us policy is a total wreck and cubas position is 
being vindicated by latin america thirty years have gone by and 
were still here 
castros forces overthrew the dictatorship of fulgencio batista 
almost exactly 30 years ago on jan 1 1959 
ironically one of castros patrons when he was organizing his 
revolution here was lazaro cardenas cuauhtemocs father 
lazaro cardenas a former president a leftist and a power in 
mexican politics got castro out of trouble when he was imprisoned 
while training his little band of revolutionaries near mexico city 
castro was treated like a conquering hero from the moment he 
arrived at mexico citys airport wednesday night 
at news conferences he received lengthy rounds of applause from 
local reporters on a walking tour of the citys central alameda he 
kissed women and children and recovered an old mans windblown hat 
one local columnist even complimented castros huge squad of 
bodyguards for their backslapping friendliness 
salinas made sure to introduce the attending heads of state 
during his inaugural address thursday and castro got by far the 
biggest ovation by that time cardenas supporters already had walked 
out 
castro stood and smiled then sat back as salinas made it plain 
he would push mexico toward the free market and further away from 
state domination of the economy 
social wellbeing in a modern state is not identified with 
paternalism that supplants effort or inhibits character salinas 
said 
castro by contrast summed up a long news conference statement 
on the evils of capitalism by saying socialism cannot be built 
with capitalist tools 
the comment was an implicit criticism of the reforms of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev castro will be receiving a visit 
from gorbachev later this week 
one issue upon which salinas and castro agreed on is the need to 
reduce latin americas staggering foreign debt mexicos stands at 
102 billion 
but while castro called for draconian measures of nonpayment 
salinas leaned toward negotiation and a sales job telling bankers 
the money mexico saves will be used to drive economic growth in a 
competitive economy 
salinas and us presidentelect george bush met 10 days before 
salinas was inaugurated and hit it off there was good 
chemistry said shultz and that is a very good sign 
castros assessment of bush was cautious he said he hoped bush 
was pragmatic enough to recognize new latin american realities 
among them the failure of us efforts to isolate cuba 
he said cuba would consider rejoining the organization of 
american states as an active member if invited and if the oas became 
more of a venue for latin american nations to act in concert about 
their problems 
castro ended his trip with a nostalgic visit to tuxpan the port 
from which he set sail to revolutionary victory 32 years ago 
mexico is like a second fatherland mexico was the only country 
to refuse to submit to the orders of the united states it was the 
only one not to break relations with cuba he said referring to 
mexicos refusal to join a usled diplomatic boycott of cuba in 
the 1960s 
we need mexico we need the prestige of mexico castro said

a former fbi agent who was the top agency 
contact for jackie pressers role as a teamsters informant was 
jailed monday for refusing to testify at the embezzlement and 
racketeering trial of two union officials 
my position is the same as friday robert s friedrick told 
us district court judge george w white who revoked friedricks 
1000 bond and ordered him jailed to try to force him to testify 
under a grant of immunity 
friedricks attorney william d beyer has appealed the judges 
contempt citation of friday to the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
in cincinnati 
friedrick invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination when called as a witness friday prosecutors had 
tried to have three of his sworn sworn statements admitted as 
evidence but white ruled the material untrustworthy 
beyer said the friedrick interviews on jan 8 9 and 13 of 1986 
conflicted with friedricks earlier testimony because there were 
two versions of his statement beyer said any new testimony could 
conflict with one or the other version and might put friedrick in 
jeopardy of perjury charges 
government attorneys indicated they wanted to call friedrick to 
the stand to prove that pressers fbi informant handlers never 
authorized the unions hiring ghost employees who were paid for 
doing no work 
stephen h jigger a government prosecutor said friedricks 
testimony was crucial because of three presser fbi handlers 
friedrick sometimes was the only agent who attended meetings with 
presser and anthony hughes a codefendant and recording secretary 
of teamsters local 507 in cleveland 
hughes and harold friedman a teamsters international vice 
president and president of local 507 are charged with plotting a 
700000 scheme to hire ghost employees presser who was 
teamsters international president was indicted on similar charges 
but died july 9 before going on trial 
after friedrick who was fired by the fbi in august 1986 
repeated his unwillingness to testify deputy us marshals took him 
into custody the us marshals service said he was taken to the 
justice center lockup 
the judge said friedrick could be jailed for up to 18 months for 
criminal contempt 
jigger also asked the judge to consider delaying the trial to 
give friedrick time behind bars to reconsider his unwillingness to 
testify jigger said the prosecution has just one more witness to 
call 
william c lynch a senior justice department trial attorney also 
on the prosecution team said the grant of immunity would rule out 
use against friedrick any testimony he gives in the current trial 
the judge excused the jury until wednesday for procedural 
arguments outside the its presence

the reagan administration would find nothing 
embarrassing in concluding a meeting with soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev that produced no breakthroughs or agreements a white 
house spokesman said monday 
but the two sides expanding the superpower dialogue decided to 
set up a separate session between secretary of state george p 
shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the session will be held at the us mission to the united 
nations on wednesday morning in advance of gorbachevs luncheon on 
governors island ny with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush state department spokesman charles e redman said 
while striving to limit american expectations for the luncheon 
meeting white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged that 
gorbachev could spring a surprise there 
reminded that various soviet officials and analysts have said 
over the weekend that gorbachev had more in mind than just a cordial 
talk with reagan and bush fitzwater said im sure the soviets 
want to put a positive face on this trip 
the us embassy in moscow citing comments of a soviet foreign 
trade official has advised washington in a cablegram to expect 
several new proposals aimed at lowering us limits on trade and 
lending with communist countries the new york times reported in 
tuesday editions 
the proposals are said to include soviet access to american stock 
and financial markets clearing the way for the soviet union to 
issue bonds and other securities in the united states 
gorbachev may also use the trip to express soviet interest in 
gaining access to several international economic organizations 
including the world bank the cable said according to the times 
the soviet leader also may discuss advance arrangements for an 
early summit with bush and plans to use his un speech to call for 
new momentum in dealing with a variety of international issues 
soviet academician georgi arbatov told a new york news conference 
monday 
another soviet official central committee spokesman nikolai 
shishlin offered a similar assessment saying the key issue of 
gorbachevs visit will be discussing ways to translate his new 
political thinking into progress in international relations 
but fitzwater said he was unaware of any major new soviet 
initiative and suggested that us officials would not let 
gorbachev put them under pressure to respond immediately to new 
proposals 
we are being very realistic fitzwater said explaining the 
us situation this way 
we have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks who 
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to keep 
and we have a new president who will be taking office in a few 
weeks who is not going to be making commitments when he doesnt 
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make 
these judgments 
so we find nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about 
characterizing this meeting as a friendly discussion fitzwater 
said an open airing of issues between us and a healthy approach 
towards continuity 
he said the fact that us and soviet officials can sit down and 
talk without there having to be tangible immediate results or 
agreements illustrates the strength of the new relationship 
between washington and moscow 
this meeting is symbolic of that the fact that you can have 
meetings without having 10month kinds of summits summits about 10 
months apart that weve known in the past he said 
reagan and gorbachev had a fiveday summit in moscow last spring 
the two exchanged the final instruments of ratification for the 
treaty banning shortand intermediaterange nuclear weapons during 
that meeting 
but there is no reason to expect anything more than that from 
the us side at this juncture he added the spokesman said for 
instance that at the present time there is no call for a meeting 
in new york of the ussoviet arms negotiating teams 
fitzwater also said that neither he nor other us officials know 
what gorbachev plans to tell the un general assembly in his 
address wednesday which is scheduled just before the kremlin leader 
travels to governors island to meet reagan and bush 
he said that the language of the soviet advance team over the 
weekend was optimistic and upbeat and so forth but it was all 
very general 
its certainly true that we dont expect to be making any new 
proposals and we dont expect any in the sense of requiring 
onthesite response or any onlocation negotiating or anything like 
that fitzwater said obviously theyll have new ideas or 
things to say may have fresh approaches to some of the regional 
problems and thats all well and good 
if a surprise proposal is advanced by gorbachev he said well 
say thank you and well take a look at them 
fitzwater said that reagan briefed on the eastwest situation by 
national security adviser colin d powell and bush joined the 
president for mondays session in the oval office

south africa which last week walked out of 
usmediated talks seeking the withdrawal of foreign forces from 
southwestern africa reportedly has assured the united states it 
will sign the settlement 
the washington post reported in tuesdays editions that south 
africa has resolved an internal conflict over terms of the accord 
and that us officials expect at least that the protocol to the 
settlement will be signed later this month and perhaps the full 
document as well 
it looks as though they have worked out what was bothering 
them the newspaper quoted an unidentified us official as 
saying they will go ahead 
the walkout had prompted speculation that south africa would not 
sign the agreement but the post said the delay appeared to be caused 
by internal south african political dynamics and not terms of the 
accord 
the goal of the talks which involve cuba angola and south 
africa is agreement on the withdrawal of cuban forces from angola 
and on namibian independence from south africa us assistant 
secretary of state chester crocker is serving as mediator for the 
talks 
before the start of the talks in brazzaville the congo there 
had been high hopes they would conclude with a signed agreement but 
the south african delegation walked out saturday night producing 
speculation that the negotiations had been derailed 
state department spokesman charles redman said monday there was 
considerable progress last week and we still look forward 
resolving the issues that remain and concluding a final settlement 
as soon as possible 
he denied suggestions that a hitch had developed in the talks 
over the process by which the withdrawal of cuban troops would be 
verified 
unless the parties change their basic decisions the process 
remains on track redman said 
south african foreign minister pik botha also has denied that the 
talks are at an impasse 
the process is irreversible botha said sunday we continue 
to progress stepbystep he added that the talks could be resumed 
within a few days

us district judge orinda evans said in a 14page ruling that 
the verdict reached by a federal jury after two days of 
deliberation in october had no basis in law or fact she reversed 
the verdict in favor of randy l jones 35 and granted judgment for 
miles laboratories 
miles based in elkhart ind manufactures koate a bloodbased 
factor viii clotting product which jones took to control a mild 
case of hemophilia after surgery at clayton general hospital in 1983 
jones who lives in the atlanta area was diagnosed in 1985 as 
infected with the virus that causes aids two years later he was 
told by doctors he had developed the disease itself 
in his lawsuit jones contended the drug he took had been 
contaminated with the aids virus contracted by an unemployed texas 
man who allegedly sold plasma 40 times to a plasma center in austin 
texas which in turn supplied miles 
the texas man died of aids less than six weeks after his last 
plasma sale in september 1983 the suit said 
jones contended in his suit that more than 60000 vials of koate 
were contaminated with the aids virus because of the texas mans 
infection he charged that miles was negligent in acquiring and 
using the infected plasma 
miles in its appeal denied any negligence 
bud modersbach the berkeley calif counsel for cutter 
biologicals the miles division which manufactures koate said 
monday that the jurys decision was overruled because it was so 
clearcut 
modersbach said the company had initiated a highrisk donor 
screening program in february 1983 months before jones took the 
drug and he said much less was known then about aids transmission 
than is now known 
he said the jury may have acted more on emotion than on the facts 
in the trial 
judge evans said in her ruling that jones did not address miles 
argument that he could just as well have gotten aids from other 
blood factor products 
george h connell jr jones attorney said he planned to appeal 
judge evans ruling to the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
jones he said is a pretty strong man he thinks hes right and 
wants to pursue the appeal

the ilyushin62m aircraft that arrived here 
resembles the one used by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
actually it was the kremlins first ever press plane dubbed by its 
occupants glasnost one 
the aeroflot charter touched down monday at john f kennedy 
international airport 24 hours ahead of the soviet leader 
scheduled arrival it will accompany gorbachev throughout his trip 
this week to new york havana and london 
the caviar was black russian and better than the fare usually 
found at 30000 feet but the inaugural flight of glasnost one 
named after gorbachevs policy of openness had little else to 
recommend it 
the trip began at 630 am moscow time with dozens of 
journalists shivering in the zerodegree darkness outside the soviet 
foreign ministry press center as they waited for the first of two 
special buses to take them to the airport 
it ended 20 hours later at 630 pm est with 70 disgruntled 
reporters photographers and camera crews milling about outside the 
united nations abandoned by their soviet escorts with no passes to 
enter the un building where gorbachev is to address the general 
assembly on wednesday 
as might be expected on a first flight glasnost one had none of 
the practiced perfection that has given the press corps that travels 
aboard the white house press plane the reputation of a pampered 
pack there was no pocketsize printed schedule with every move 
clocked to the minute no spin doctors available to offer 
precious background no speech transcripts and most important no 
accreditation which the white house always arranges for those 
traveling with it 
organized at the request of moscows foreign press corps which 
quickly discerned it could not keep up with gorbachev by flying 
commercial particularly since there is no direct service between 
the united states and cuba the flight offered the singular 
advantage of speed 
but with only one event a news conference scheduled for monday 
the gang from glasnost one missed it representatives of the 
official soviet press got there in plenty of time however by 
taking the pan am nonstop two days before 
for a fare of 4880 foreign currency only no rubles please 
the charter did provide relatively quick passage through the 
notoriously slowmoving lines at customs and passport control in 
moscows sheremetovo airport 
but the flight entailed a threehour rest and refueling stop at 
gander newfoundland and upon arrival at jfk the plane taxied to a 
remote revetment where the passengers huddled beneath the belly of 
the craft to claim each piece of luggage and camera gear before 
loading their buses for the trip into manhattan 
with no schedule and none of their ministry minders 
disclosing any plans no one realized until the buses crossed the 
east river and turned north instead of south that they werent 
headed for the united nations 
as the buses pulled up not far from the soviet mission to the 
united nations a tall thin soviet escort who never gave his name 
said he was going around the corner to get further instructions he 
returned several minutes later saying he could find no one in 
authority everyone apparently having gone to the press conference 
that was just about over blocks away at un headquarters 
he gave them a phone number to try later then stepped off the 
bus as it pulled away to take the weary mob to the united nations 
which by then had closed 
all the best he said and vanished into the night

leftist insurgents attacked an 
army brigade headquarters late monday with mortars and assault 
rifles and claimed to they killed or wounded 28 government soldiers 
the attack occurred at the 3rd brigades compound in the eastern 
city of san miguel it was the third time this year that rebels have 
struck a brigade headquarters 
an officer reached by telephone at the brigade said a few mortar 
rounds apparently fell inside the base perimeter but that damage 
appeared slight the officer who refused to give his name had no 
information on possible casualties 
the ysu radio station quoted military sources as saying two 
mortar rounds fell inside brigade headquarters 
the clandestine guerrilla radio venceremos said the attack killed 
or wounded 28 soldiers from the 3rd brigade or from the elite arce 
battalion which is attached to the brigade 
guerrillas in recent months have tended to inflate their claims 
of casualties inflicted on government forces 
authorities said the marxistled rebels who have been at war 
nine years with the usbacked government also destroyed with 
incendiary bombs two stores in san miguel 85 miles east of the 
capital 
army col leon linares speaking by telephone with the ysu radio 
station said from san miguel that three mortar rounds were fired at 
the brigade and arce sector he did not indicate what damage they 
may have caused 
linares said the 2hour attack was directed at civilian targets 
sporadic gunfire was heard in several parts of the city 
the guerrillas in their radio broadcast said the attack was 
part of an offensive dubbed power and organization of the people 
on its march toward insurrection 
the insurgents attacked the 6th brigade in usulutan in february 
and the 4th brigade in el paraiso in september both those attacks 
appeared to be larger than mondays

plutonium processing could resume by late 
january at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in colorado an 
energy department spokesman said monday 
doe shut down the main plutonium processing room at the plant 
oct 8 because of a safety violation 
officials hope the plants operator rockwell international 
corp will have a startup plan by midjanuary said rich marquez a 
spokesman for the does albuquerque operations office which 
oversees the plant 16 miles northwest of denver 
the energy department then would review the plan and inspect the 
plant marquez said adding that the plutonium processing then could 
be restarted by late january 
its critical to reopen the facility but its equally critical 
that it be done right marquez said adding that the energy 
department has not had a specific schedule for reopening 
the plant was shut down in response to a sept 29 incident in 
which an energy department inspector and two rockwell employees 
entered a room in which workers were cleaning up radioactive 
contamination officials said 
officials said the workers in the room were wearing protective 
clothing and masks but the inspector and two rockwell employees 
were not because a warning sign was blocked from view energy 
officials said two of them tested positive for contamination but 
the situation was not viewed as lifethreatening 
marquez said rockwell has been cleaning up the facility 
measuring the level of radiation in the building and working on any 
needed modifications to procedures as part of its reopening plan 
the reopening could be put off until february or march he said 
adding up to now things are progressing as they should

the bulletin of the atomic scientists 
celebrated the signing of the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
treaty last year by turning the clock back to six minutes to 
midnight a step back from the brink of apocalypse 
the symbolic clock the antinuclear publication said had 
previously been even closer to nuclear destruction at three minutes 
to midnight 
but on the eve of the fifth meeting between president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev experts differ on whether the 
inf pact actually made the world a safer place to live 
presidentelect george bush who will participate in the 
reagangorbachev meeting hopes to expand on the inf treaty as he 
eventually engages gorbachev in negotiations on strategic nuclear 
forces and conventional armies in europe 
the inf pact was a milestone it was the first ussoviet arms 
control deal since the second strategic arms limitation treaty 
signed in 1979 
it was the first treaty to eliminate an entire class of newly 
developed weapons other arms treaties had merely set ceilings that 
led to the elimination of some obsolete systems 
after so many steps in the wrong direction the inf treaty is a 
step in the right one the bulletin of the atomic scientists said 
for the first time the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to dismantle and ban a whole category of nuclear weapons 
rep les aspin rwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said the inf pact pushed the atlantic alliance down the 
slippery slope toward european denuclearization 
but former secretary of state henry kissinger said the soviet 
cuts do not reduce in any significant manner the soviet capacity to 
attack europe with nuclear weapons and increase the soviet 
conventional threat to europe because the warsaw pact has more 
tanks and ground troops that the north atlantic treaty organization 
kissinger said gorbachev wanted the treaty for the calculated 
purpose of weakening ties between the united states and western 
europe and between germany and the atlantic alliance 
joseph nye a harvard university professor who was a principal 
foreign policy adviser to democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis said the inf treaty in and of itself is not terribly 
significant eliminating that number of weapons 4 percent of the 
total of all nuclear arms is not a major accomplishment 
the significance is more political symbolizing the ability of 
the two nations to get together said nye in that sense the 
treaty left the world a safer place because it was a step toward 
joint management of nuclear weapons 
the inf pact ratified by the us senate and the soviet 
parliament in may and formally exchanged at the moscow summit last 
summer called for the united states and the soviet union to destroy 
all their groundbased missiles with ranges of 3003400 miles 859 
weapons for america and 1836 for the soviet union it does not 
apply to air or sealaunched nuclear missiles in this range 
category 
more is going on under inf than missile crunching 
the soviet and us missiles are being withdrawn and destroyed 
under the watchful eyes of teams of inspectors composed largely of 
military officers from the two superpowers 
the trust engendered by those contacts is softening the attitudes 
of some hardline officers veterans of the cold war who have been 
thrust to the forefront of the eastwest thaw 
the us onsite inspection agency is headed by brig gen roland 
lajoie a nononsense officer who served two tours as a military 
attache in moscow and was commander of the military liaison office 
in east germany when soviet soldiers shot and killed us maj 
arthur nicholson on march 24 1985 
clearly there was a considerable change in our relationship 
since the inf pact was signed lajoie said last summer much of the 
suspicion he said is gone now 
lajoie also marveled at being able to go to a base for the main 
soviet mediumrange missile the ss20 that is something i would 
never have dreamed i could do as a military attache that in 
itself is a startling development he said 
john d steinbruner director of foreign policy studies at the 
liberal brookings institution says gorbachev should get the credit 
for pushing along ussoviet relations 
the superpower leaders said steinbruner have set a 
constructive trend but it has not yet gone far enough to say that 
the world is a safer place 
he added there is a policy emerging from the kremlin that if 
carried out would make the world a safer place 
bruce weinrod director of foreign policy studies at the 
conservative heritage foundation credits the tough policies of 
reagan for driving the soviet union toward equitable arms control 
deals 
with gorbachev the jury is still out he has certainly created 
more space inside his country for discussion but it is not 
clear how far the internal loosening will go weinrod said

nearly 700 plant species in the united states 
face extinction by the year 2000 and those in rapidly developing 
parts of the nation are at particular risk a conservation group 
says 
the private center for plant conservation said 73 percent of the 
plants facing extinction are in southerly subtropical regions with 
intense economic or population growth hawaii california texas 
florida and puerto rico 
the causes of extinction are by now quite familiar to us 
destruction of habitat population growth urban suburban and 
industrial sprawl irresponsible resource extraction overuse of 
public land donald falk the centers executive director said 
monday a consequence of that is this tremendously accelerated 
rate of extinction that were seeing in these priority regions 
falk said some of the endangered plants are relatives of 
important timber products food groups or plants used in 
horticulture and landscaping 
the centers 1year study found that 253 species may become 
extinct within five years and another 427 may vanish by the turn of 
the century as many as 52 of the plant species may already be 
extinct in the wild 
the center is a consortium of 19 botanical gardens and arboreta 
headquartered in boston 
what were dealing with here is just another sign of a planet 
in trouble and indeed a national environment in trouble said 
thomas lovejoy an expert on tropical rain forests and assistant 
secretary for external affairs at the smithsonian institution 
at least 200 kinds of plants already have become extinct during 
the past two centuries experts generally agree and 
conservationists worry that the rate may accelerate as population 
and economic growth jeopardize habitats a 1973 study by the 
smithsonian found that 3000 of the nations 25000 species are 
endangered 
working with endangered species means working against the 
clock falk said at a news conference at the smithsonian its 
kind of like being in the emergency room all the time 
falk said it would cost 10 million to 15 million to protect and 
propagate all 680 of the threatened plants 6 million to 7 million 
to target only those in the priority areas or 3 million to 4 
million to save only plants facing extinction within five years 
every species lost represents an irretrievable loss of 
biological diversity and potential ecological values and potential 
human values falk said once a species goes extinct you cant 
then change your mind you cant then say that species was 
beautiful or that might have helped medicine or that species might 
have been scientifically interesting or might have been ecologically 
significant you dont get a second chance with endangered species

this weeks trade talks in montreal are 
unlikely to result in any major new agreement to reduce agriculture 
subsidies around the world says one farm lawmaker and that could 
lead congress to take an even harder line when writing the next 
generation of us agriculture law 
a major agriculture accord in montreal is not going to 
happen said rep dan glickman dkan chairman of the house 
agriculture grains subcommittee glickman spent two days in montreal 
talking with negotiators before the talks opened monday 
but unless the 12nation european community the major us foe 
on the farmsubsidy issue makes strides toward an eventual 
elimination of subsidies the 1990 farm bill will take an 
assertive aggressive and rather combative attitude glickman 
predicted 
other farm lawmakers in montreal to observe the talks including 
senate agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt have 
been pushing the same message 
i got the clear feeling that the ec is not terribly interested 
in negotiating away their unfair trade subsidies he said they 
are going into the next two years with a very hardline attitude 
the ec contends that its farm subsidies are not unfair to other 
trading nations and it has said it would be willing to scale back 
such government assistance programs if proportional cutbacks also 
were made by other major trading countries 
glickman said the dispute makes it important that the united 
states continue to give strong emphasis to export subsidies many 
of which were devised to counter similar subsidies by the ec and 
not let them fall victim to the budget knife in the congress that 
convenes in january 
agriculture is going to have to share in these budget cuts 
he said but there are a variety of ways agriculture can cope 
with having less money we have to protect export subsidy 
spending or the ec will eat our lunch 
the dispute over how to handle agricultural subsidies was at the 
top of the agenda as the 96 signatory nations to the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade met in montreal failure to reach an 
accord on how to handle the subsidies issue threatened to stymie 
progress in other trade areas 
the united states is pressing for an end to all farm subsidies on 
a definite timetable that would be advantageous to the 2 million or 
so us commercial farmers because they are largerscale and more 
efficient producers 
but for the ec which has for years heavily subsidized its 11 
millionplus farm producers it would be politically impossible to 
eliminate all farm support payments 
the chief us agriculture negotiator daniel amstutz said the 
united states had moved away from setting a deadline of the year 
2000 for elimination of subsidies were flexible he said but 
wed rather not have any agreement than a bad one

the agriculture department released a new 
outlook report indicating us farm exports are expected to continue 
to climb in the current fiscal year growing by 1 billion to a 
total of 365 billion 
a 25 billion rise in grain and feed shipments will more than 
offset declines in the value of cotton and oilseed exports the 
department projected 
agricultural imports meanwhile were expected to match the 
fiscal 1988 record of 21 billion meaning an overall increase of 1 
billion in the us farm trade surplus to 155 billion

a study by the international monetary fund has 
strongly criticized the joint farm policies of the 12 governments in 
the european community 
the basic mistake is the belief that stable and adequate 
incomes for farmers can be achieved through agricultural price 
support the study said 
as historical experience has vividly demonstrated this 
instrument is neither effective nor efficient 
it added that the system has brought windfall gains to efficient 
largescale european farmers and has not given adequate income to 
small ones 
the study the common agricultural policy of the european 
community was written by six experts of the fund which is owned 
by 151 governments 
european farmers get protection from foreign competition by a 
system of variable levies on imports these are customs duties that 
rise and fall with world prices payable by european importers so 
that domestic products are cheaper to european consumers at any 
given moment farmers also benefit from price supports to keep their 
incomes relatively high this system helped western europe become 
selfsufficient in food after world war ii but in recent years it 
has encouraged the creation of huge product surpluses 
the community has a problem in exporting its surpluses and uses 
european tax money to subsidize the sales and to pay the enormous 
cost of storing the excess 
the us government also uses price supports to keep farmers 
incomes high restricts imports and thus creates surpluses it also 
uses tax money to subsidize exports but according to the funds 
figures the europeans have increased their share of the worlds 
export trade in farm products in recent years

businesses that are the target of lawsuits 
seeking big payoffs from deep pockets are getting a supreme 
court hearing in their challenge to multimilliondollar punitive 
damage awards 
the justices said monday they will decide whether such awards 
violate a constitutional ban against excessive fines 
a ruling expected by july could determine the future of a 
growing trend in us courtrooms that has sparked legislative debate 
nationwide at stake are huge sums of money awarded in a wide 
variety of lawsuits 
the high court which failed in the past to resolve the question 
will tackle the issue in an appeal by a texasbased waste collection 
company ordered to pay 6 million to a vermont competitor 
a number of business groups including the national association 
of manufacturers say the situation is critical 
because of their deep pockets manufacturers are bearing 
the brunt of a massive and discriminatory increase in 
punitivedamages verdicts the association said 
the term punitive damages applies to awards aimed at both 
punishing and deterring misconduct 
one of the questions confronting the high court is whether 
punitive damages must bear any specific relationship to compensatory 
damages awarded for actual injuries 
the high court in may declined to decide the constitutionality of 
very large punitivedamage awards in that case it upheld on 
narrow procedural grounds a 18 million judgment against an 
insurance company that wrongfully rejected a 20000 claim 
left unresolved was the legitimacy of skyrocketing 
punitivedamage awards a development that has touched off a wave of 
legislative activity often called tort reform 
some states reacting to soaring insurance premiums and pleas 
from the industry have imposed ceilings on punitive damages 
a recent federal study cited explosive growth in damage 
awards it said for example that the average jury award for 
medical malpractice leaped 2000 percent from 1960 to 1984 from 
52000 to 12 million with adjustment for inflation jury awards 
in some productliability cases increased more than tenfold to 
average 11 million the study said 
the court will address the issue by reviewing a decision by the 
2nd us circuit court of appeals in april that upheld a 6 million 
award against browningferris industries inc of houston 
the appeals court said that while the actual damages in the case 
were around 100000 we do not think the punitive damages here 
were so disproportionate as to be cruel unusual or constitutionally 
excessive 
browningferris decided in 1973 to enter the waste disposal 
business in burlington vt the company appointed joseph kelley to 
be district manager for its new regional office 
kelley left browningferris in 1980 to form his own company 
kelco disposal inc which captured more than 40 percent of the 
market in the burlington region by 1982 
browningferris according to testimony in the case then 
instructed its new burlington manager to put kelley out of 
business do whatever it takes squish him like a bug 
browningferris then cut its prices almost in half kelley 
contended the pricecutting maneuver was a predatory violation 
of antitrust law to drive him out of business and permit 
browningferris to create a monopoly 
browningferris market share in the burlington area declined 
sharply from 1980 to 1982 but remained fairly stable from 1982 to 
1984 after it cut prices 
kelco captured a 56 percent market share by 1985 and remained in 
business 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether a federal law allowing public scrutiny 
of governmental advisory groups applies to the american bar 
associations role in selecting federal judges 
agreed in a case from alabama to hear a reagan administration 
appeal aimed at limiting recovery of lawyers fees for people who 
win disputes with the government over social security benefits 
refused to revive a 70000 award to a tennessee woman who said 
her rights were violated in a dispute with public school officials 
over what she claimed were godless textbooks 
refused in a california case to bar police from conducting 
roadside sobriety tests by setting up checkpoints at unannounced 
locations

terrorist acts against americans have increased 
sharply this year although the number of casualties has fallen the 
state department said 
the department also reported monday that terrorism worldwide is 
rising 
incidents directed against americans in the first nine months of 
this year rose to 157 from 108 in the corresponding period last 
year it said three americans were killed and 25 injured compared 
with one death and 38 wounded in the earlier period 
almost half of the attacks on americans this year were bombings 
of us oil company property in colombia no one was killed in these 
incidents 
the three american deaths were in greece italy and peru 
terrorist incidents worldwide totaled 680 in the first nine 
months of this year up from 655 in the same period last year the 
number of casualties declined however to 278 killed and 875 
wounded from the yearearlier total of 443 killed and 2014 injured 
increases in terrorist acts in asia latin america and africa 
outweighed declines in western europe and other areas 
an increase in asia to 155 incidents from 130 was due largely 
to south korea which reported no international attacks in the first 
nine months of last year but 10 in 1988 these were mostly attacks 
against us offices in seoul 
in western europe terrorist incidents linked to events in the 
middle east were down to 20 from 35 a year ago terrorist attacks of 
other types in western europe rose to 83 from 82

the house democratic and republican leaders are 
putting election campaign reform high on their 1989 agendas but 
they are disagreeing over whether house members need stricter ethics 
standards 
speaker jim wright dtexas and minority leader bob michel 
rill both are calling for changes in a system that is successful 
for incumbents voters last month reelected 402 of the 408 house 
members seeking new terms 
well pass clean elections legislation wright told his 
democratic colleagues monday after they unanimously voted to give 
him a second twoyear term as the houses top official 
the only specific change he mentioned however was a law setting 
a simultaneous poll closing time around the nation which advocates 
see as a way of preventing voting in the west from being influenced 
by results in the east 
michel whose party has had difficulty cutting into the 260175 
democratic bulge in the house made no specific election proposals 
as he called for wright to join in forming a bipartisan task force 
to fashion reforms of house ethics standards outside income and 
campaign practices 
michel made the call as he was unanimously elected by the 
republicans to his fifth twoyear term as their leader his speech 
put far more emphasis on ethics than on campaign reform an issue 
that congress has grappled with unsuccessfully for a decade 
the record of ethics enforcement in this house is a national 
disgrace said michel who referred to no specific cases we 
must more clearly define our ethics rules and then we have to 
enforce them the time for reform is here 
wright meeting with reporters later in the day disagreed with 
michels assessment on ethics but offered to discuss the issues with 
him 
for the most part members of the house are decent 
responsible and ethical people said wright whose personal 
finances and possible divulging of government secrets are under 
investigation by the house ethics committee he has denied any 
wrongdoing 
in his acceptance speech wright said the house in the 101st 
congress would approve a new clean air act and would work to clean 
up those areas of our business practices where management needs 
regulation 
he cited the disappearance of banks corporations and farms in 
economic reshufflings and leveraged buyouts that intensify and 
concentrate economic wealth in fewer and fewer hands 
in the separate party meetings two women house members lost bids 
to crack the allmale top leadership ranks 
on the republican side rep lynn martin of illinois came up four 
votes short of beating rep jerry lewis of california for chairman 
of the house republican conference the no 3 gop leadership post 
rep mary rose oakar dohio was defeated easily by rep william 
gray dpa for chairmanship of the house democratic caucus the 
no 4 job in the democratic hierarchy he replaces rep richard 
gephardt dmo 
grays election marked the first time a black house member had 
advanced this high on a leadership ladder that traditionally has led 
to the speakers office he earned high marks over the past four 
years as budget committee chairman a pivotal house post that 
carries a twoterm limit 
gray said he was proud of his racial heritage but was not elected 
because of it 
he said he hoped to be a role model to blacks to show them you 
ought to strive you ought to work you ought to aim high but

studies lasting almost two years have confirmed 
earlier findings that tretinoin a vitamin a acid derivative is 
able to help smooth skin wrinkles and repair some damage of aging 
and sunlight exposure 
dr john j voorhees of the university of michigan medical school 
said monday that use of tretinoin cream on a small group of patients 
over 22 months has shown the drug can cause the skin to repair some 
of the marks left by time and to erase some blemishes 
whatever type of wrinkling that has occurred treatment from 
tretinoin will improve voorhees said in a report at the annual 
meeting of the american academy of dermatology 
in a report published last january in the journal of the american 
medical association voorhees said that a fourmonth study using 
tretinoin cream caused fine skin wrinkles to disappear on the face 
and arms 
he said monday that study has now been extended to 22 months and 
that 21 patients have remained in the experiment from the beginning 
careful photographic analysis of treated areas of the skin on the 
arms and face he said have shown that the drug has erased many 
fine wrinkles caused a lightening of socalled liver spots and 
caused improvements in deep wrinkles skin sagging and droopy 
eyelids 
voorhees said examination of skin samples by electron microscope 
shows that skin treated with tretinoin develops new collagen fiber 
a natural substance that lends elasticity to the skin and helps 
prevent wrinkles he said the sample skin also showed that blood 
vessels are dilated which helps improve skin color and that the 
skin actually thickens 
the continuing studies said voorhees shows the longer you use 
it the better it works 
in another study james j leyden of the university of 
pennsylvania said he assessed the drug in a double blind study using 
40 patients half of whom received tretinoin cream and half 
received cream without the drug 
to measure the precise effect silicone molds were taken of the 
laugh line area around the eyes of the patients these molds 
were analyzed by computer and the wrinkles were given numerical 
values at the end of six months more molds were made 
leyden said those who received the tretinoin cream showed a 32 
percent reduction in fine wrinkles and a 22 percent reduction in 
deeper skin furrows 
dr barbara a gilchrest of boston university school of medicine 
said the application of tretinoin a vitamin a acid derivative has 
been shown in studies to reduce the number and size of skin lesions 
called actinic keratoses 
dr barbara a gilchrest of boston university school of medicine 
said tretinoin is the most exciting thing to happen in the field 
of skin aging in this century it allows for the possibility that 
some aspects of skin aging can be reversed 
but she added that the drug is only for those who are willing to 
put up with weeks or even months of soreness or peeling to 
achieve skin improvements that may be slow and subtle 
i tell patients not to expect miracles and that the changes 
will be subtle she said the benefits as we understand them 
now will be largely cosmetic 
gilchrest said preliminary findings in yearlong studies at 10 
medical centers shows that tretinoin acts on cells in the actinic 
keratoses lesions to prevent them from turning into cancer 
precisely how the drug works she said is not understood 
but she said the findings suggest that tretinoin in addition to 
correcting skin wrinkling also may help prevent a common type of 
skin cancer 
actinic keratoses are dry scaly spots on the skin that dont 
heal normally and can sometimes develop into squamous cell 
carcinoma a type of skin cancer 
tretinoin which is marketed by ortho pharmaceuticals under the 
brand name retina is authorized by the food and drug 
administration for the treatment of acne the drug has been used 
experimentally for the treatment of aging but has not yet been 
approved by the fda for that use 
voorhees said studies now are under way directed toward clearing 
tretinoin for the treatment of wrinkles and other skin damage caused 
by exposure to sunlight 
albert m kligman a university of pennsylvania professor who 
first reported the antiwrinkling effects of tretinoin said he 
believes that patients who want the full benefits of the drug must 
make a lifelong commitment to applying the cream at least three 
times weekly to get its full benefit 
he said patients can go to a minimum dosage after one or two 
years using the cream and that this will continue to prevent the 
skin aging 
voorhees said the cost of retina which can sold only with a 
perscription is about 1450 for a months supply

the white house and state department are 
presenting a united front in denying that the united states and 
israel had an agreement to conduct joint covert operations against 
terrorists 
congressional sources said that if there were such a compact as 
alleged by a former israeli official the reagan administration 
never told lawmakers about it reagan never signed any such 
agreement his spokesman said monday 
the denials were prompted by a weekend news story which said such 
a usisraeli agreement had been revealed by former israeli 
official amiram nir 
in jerusalem the office of foreign minister shimon peres also 
denied the report in the washington post saying there is no such 
agreement foreign ministry spokesman alon liel declined to 
elaborate 
nir a prominent figure in the irancontra affair said in june 
that a compact allowed such covert operations which he said he 
supervised with thennational security council aide oliver l north 
the newspaper said 
the post reported nirs assertions in its sunday editions four 
days after the 37yearold former israeli counterterrorism official 
was killed in the crash of a light plane in mexico 
north is charged with a variety of offenses including conspiracy 
and illegal diversion of millions of dollars in government money 
the charges center on the reagan administrations clandestine sales 
of us arms to iran in 198586 and subsequent diversion of proceeds 
to the contra rebels in nicaragua north is scheduled to stand trial 
in late january 
nir said in june the agreement authorized stillsecret operations 
that he and north supervised in 198586 the post said 
it said american and israeli sources confirmed the existence of 
the israeliamerican agreement referred to as terms of 
reference or accords by some sources 
sources at the house and senate intelligence committees said 
monday no such agreement had been reported to congress 
it is a serious allegation that there exists an agreement to 
engage in covert actions that would not be reported to congress 
said one source speaking on condition of anonymity 
the law requires that any covert action be carried out only after 
it is authorized in a finding signed by the president which 
states why the activity is in the national security interest such 
findings are supposed to be reported to congressional review 
committees on a timely basis 
asked whether such an agreement existed presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater replied the bottom line is that we dont believe 
there is one 
he said white house officials checked with various agencies that 
might have been involved and could find no record of such an 
agreement 
fitzwater said reagan never executed any umbrella agreement or 
accord such as the one described and were not aware of the 
existence of any document fitting that description 
at the state department spokesman charles e redman echoed 
fitzwater weve done some more research and i can say no such 
agreement as discussed in that post story exists or existed he 
said 
however he said the united states shared information on 
terrorism with israel 
we do know and this may be perhaps at the root of that 
story that mr nir in his capacity in the israeli government did 
propose a more formal agreement or memorandum of agreement in the 
time period of september and october 1985 redman said but that 
proposal was immediately rejected by the united states government

a 78yearold nobel prizewinning chemist archer 
martin has regained some of his memory after taking an experimental 
drug for alzheimers disease his wife says 
i get the feeling that i can think again martin was quoted 
in a frontpage report in the sunday times as saying 
professor raymond levy in whose tests martin participated 
cautioned that the drug treats the symptoms not the disease and is 
unlikely to be a cure in any sense 
martin was one of the first volunteers when tests of the drug 
tetrahydroaminoacridine or tha began at londons institute of 
psychiatry in march and his condition improved immediately his 
wife judith said monday 
he responded not miraculously but there was certainly a 
reduction in the deterioration which was immediately noticeable 
she told british broadcasting corp radio from the couples 
cambridge home 
he didnt have attacks or irritability nearly so often it 
certainly appeared encouraging from fairly early on 
alzheimers disease is a progressive irreversible neurological 
disease with no known cause or cure victims mostly elderly people 
suffer gradual memory loss disorientation and personality changes 
levy who is conducting the trials told the associated press 
that tha is not a cure 
it doesnt reverse the process and i think its unlikely to be 
a cure in any sense he said its dealing with symptoms 
really rather than the basic cause of the disease 
levy a professor of oldage psychiatry said tha seems to 
preserve a chemical messenger called acetylcholine that helps 
control memory 
however brain cells die as alzheimers disease progresses and a 
drug such as tha can work only as long as there are enough living 
cells to produce sufficient levels of acetylcholine 
martin a biochemist won the nobel prize in 1952 for his work on 
chromatography a method of separating chemical substances his 
discoveries transformed chemistry and are still widely used in 
medicine and industry 
mrs martin said her husband began losing his memory four years 
ago and could not work because he forgot everything he read 
tha has sideeffects including a risk of liver damage but mrs 
martin said as a scientist and as a scientists wife we are both 
wellequipped to observe anything that might be going wrong 
other side effects reported from tha experiments include nausea 
vomiting and allergic reactions 
the drug hit the headlines in 1986 with a report of effectiveness 
by a california investigator but this year the us food and drug 
administration said it found numerous statements in the report 
that appeared to be false and that the investigator repeatedly or 
deliberately violated regulations on proper conduct of testing 
drugs 
tha now is being studied in followup research in the united 
states 
levy said 32 people are involved in his trials he said the drug 
produced staggering results in three of the first volunteers 
including a potter who was able to return to her craft but it also 
produced no results in three other early volunteers he said 
martin declined to be interviewed monday but the sunday times 
said he was able to give lengthy explanations of enzyme activity and 
its relation to the release of energy for mental activity

an environmental groups lawsuit to stop the 
defense departments chemical and biological weapons research and 
production accuses the pentagon of recklessly endangering the 
lives of military and civilian populations 
a central assertion of the suit filed monday in us district 
court by the foundation on economic trends is that the pentagon has 
greatly expanded the scope of such weapons programs without fully 
studying their effects on people and communities 
the production and storage of chemical agents present immediate 
and potentially catastrophic environmental and human health hazards 
to local communities and populations and yet the pentagon has 
taken a cavalier attitude toward public safety the suit charges 
the suit requests preliminary and permanent injunctions until the 
pentagon and armed services conduct detailed environmental studies 
of every phase of their chemical warfare programs 
the dramatic increase in the pentagons chemical warfare 
program has placed communities across the country at risk charged 
jeremy rifkin the president of the washingtonbased foundation 
the defense department is recklessly endangering laboratory 
workers military personnel and the general public in communities 
where chemical warfare laboratories and storage facilities are 
located the suit said 
the service declined to comment monday on the foundations suit 
saying it still was studying the matter but insisted in a statement 
it was committed to both the environment and public safety 
to buttress its case the foundation filed with the court a copy 
of an army inspector generals evaluation of chemical safety 
procedures completed this spring and first disclosed on capitol 
hill this summer 
the army is by far the largest service when it comes to 
responsibility for chemical and biological warfare research 
the internal audit concluded the army had not assigned enough 
people to chemical safety programs with expertise only one deep 
in most instances 
it also found there is not an effective oversight program in 
place for chemical safety that chemical safety has slipped through 
a crack 
the army previously had responded to the inspector generals 
audit by ordering improvements and a new study to evaluate 
adequacy of staffing for chemical safety at all levels 
the foundation on economic trends is an environmental group that 
long has focused its attention on the dangers of biological research 
and genetic engineering 
the united states citing production by the soviet union 
recently began making a new generation of toxic chemical weapons on 
the biological front using live deadly organisms as a weapon 
the united states has committed itself by international treaty not 
to develop new weapons but still conducts research to develop 
vaccines and antidotes detection systems and defensive battlefield 
gear 
the foundation alleges that the pentagon has so dramatically 
increased the funding and scope of its chemical and biological 
programs with appropriations rising 600 percent since fiscal 1980 
to more than 271 million that it is required to study 
environmental impacts even though the programs may be ongoing 
given the exponential growth in size and scope of the chemical 
warfare program the defendants cannot validly exclude those 
programs from the requirements of the national environmental policy 
act the suit asserts

a former finance officer for lyndon h 
larouche jr says the political mavericks debts quadrupled to 40 
million within one year because of heavy new borrowing on top of old 
loans that werent being repaid as promised 
wayne hintz said he eventually quit his job of trying to crisis 
manage larouches fastgrowing debt in 1986 
hintz testified monday at the start of the third week of 
larouches mail and tax fraud conspiracy trial in us district 
court 
prosecutors said they probably would complete their case against 
larouche today lawyers for the perennial presidential candidate say 
they havent decided whether to summon larouche to testify in his 
own defense 
larouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans with 
no intention of repaying them 
in addition larouche was charged with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid by 
various corporations he controls and not filing any income tax 
returns since 1978 
if convicted on all 13 counts against him larouche would face a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million 
in a separate case scheduled for retrial in boston on jan 3 
larouche is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice in 
connection with alleged unauthorized use of credit cards by 18 of 
his followers to raise 1 million for his 1984 presidential campaign 
hintz told the federal trial jury here monday that despite a 
promise by higherups to allocate 80000 a week to pay off old 
loans we had become increasingly behind in debt by the end of 
1985 
he estimated that the larouche organizations total debt early 
that year was about 10 million owed to 2000 lenders but because 
new loans were being made and old ones werent being repaid the 
debt had swollen to 40 million by years end 
the promised 80000 a week actually was allocated only once he 
said and the average made available for retiring debt was less than 
half that amount 
he said it would have taken 69000 a week just to pay the 
interest on new loans 
steven bardwell of hastings on hudson ny former editor of a 
larouche magazine called fusions testified monday that larouche 
exhorted his followers to raise large sums to help him save humanity 
from nuclear war 
the first priority for spending money raised from loans and 
contributions was to guarantee larouches security against possible 
assassination attempts said bardwell 
he said larouche berated fundraisers who failed to meet their 
quotas by accusing them of suffering sexual impotence 
bardwell said that after he quit the larouche organization in 
1984 over a defense policy dispute with larouche he hosted a 
halloween party for former larouche employees such as himself 
one guest wore a pig snout and another came dressed as the 
ayatollah khomeini of iran but the party was less than a success 
bardwell said 
bardwell suggested they play pin the rap on lyndon but he 
said monday that not many people thought that was funny 
even worse he said a gatecrasher who still worked for larouche 
came dressed as an aids virus enjoyed the party and then tattled to 
his superiors 
i thought it was very rude to come to my party and drink my 
liquor and eat my food and then go back and report on it bardwell 
said

plutonium processing may be restarted by late 
january at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant in colorado where 
production was halted in october following a safety violation a 
federal energy official said 
rockwell international corp operator of the plant 16 miles 
northwest of denver has been cleaning up radioactivity at the plant 
and devising a startup plan rich marquez an energy department 
spokesman in albuquerque nm said monday 
federal officials hope rockwell will complete its plan by 
midjanuary marquez said the energy department then would review 
the plan suggest modifications and inspect the plant marquez said 
adding that the plutonium processing could resume by the end of 
january 
the doe shut down the rocky flats plutonium processing building 
on oct 8 
its critical to reopen the facility but its equally critical 
that it be done right marquez said adding that the energy 
department has not set a specific schedule for reopening 
the plant was shut down following a sept 29 incident in which an 
energy department inspector and two rockwell employees entered a 
room where workers were cleaning up radioactive contamination 
officials said 
the workers in the room were wearing protective clothing and 
masks but officials said the inspector and two rockwell employees 
were not because a warning sign was blocked from view two of them 
tested positive for contamination but the situation was not viewed 
as lifethreatening federal officials said at the time 
marquez said rockwell has been cleaning up the facility 
measuring the level of radiation in the building and working on any 
needed procedural modifications as part of its reopening plan 
the rocky flats reopening could be delayed until february or 
march he said but added up to now things are progressing as 
they should 
in the past few months nuclear weapons production has ground to 
a virtual halt following shutdown of the rocky flats plutonium 
facility the closure of three reactors at the savannah river 
complex near aiken sc and a strike that has shut down the feed 
materials production center in fernald ohio since oct 17 
plutonium and tritium which is manufactured at savannah river 
are needed to make nuclear weapons plutonium is plentiful but 
officials have said a tritium shortage could cause problems in the 
next six to 24 months 
energy department officials have set guidelines for restarting 
the savannah river plant reactors including unannounced inspections 
and setting training and safety standards similar to those used for 
commercial nuclear reactors doe secretary john herrington said last 
week the department hopes to restart kreactor at savannah by late 
spring or early summer

atlantis astronauts zoomed toward 
earth happy and healthy today to end a secret fourday military 
mission during which they reportedly deployed a radar satellite to 
spy on the soviet union 
the shuttle and its five travelers were on course to ignite 
reentry rockets for a fiery hourlong dash through the atmosphere 
landing was scheduled for 636 pm est on a dry lakebed at edwards 
air force base in californias mojave desert 
because of the military nature of the mission the public wasnt 
allowed to watch the landing from the base more than 400000 
spectators were there in october to cheer discoverys return from 
the first postchallenger shuttle flight 
the national aeronautics and space administration and the air 
force monday broke three days of silence on the atlantis mission to 
give a 24hour notice of the planned landing 
the crew is doing well and is making preparations for 
landing the agencies said in a brief statement they also said 
the weather outlook at edwards was good and that a slow leak 
detected before launch in a landing gear tire was not a concern for 
touchdown 
things are going super rear adm richard truly a former 
astronaut in charge of the space shuttle program said in an 
interview the crew is happy and healthy the orbiter has done 
real well its been very clean 
this was one of our most important missions truly said 
its atlantis first flight after the standdown and now you have 
two vehicles proven in flight thats extremely important 
the atlantis mission was the second shuttle flight since 
challenger exploded in january 1986 halting launches for 32 months 
truly who was in the johnson space center in houston monday 
could not comment on specific accomplishments of the military 
mission 
the flight under air force command has been veiled in secrecy 
since atlantis blasted off friday morning from cape canaveral the 
usual airtoground conversations of astronauts were blacked out 
and officials gave no briefings during the flight 
however sources reported monday that the five military officers 
had successfully deployed a 500 million lacrosse satellite during 
the weekend 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
satellite was operating well in an orbit that carries it over 80 
percent of the soviet union deployment of the surveillance 
satellite was believed to be the military missions chief goal 
the satellite is said to be designed to gather extremely sharp 
allweather radar images of eastern bloc military targets and would 
help american intelligence agencies monitor soviet compliance with 
arms control treaties 
eventually it also reportedly would serve as the radar eye 
for the new b2 stealth bomber that would eliminate a bomber crews 
need to use the aircrafts own radar which might disclose its 
location 
several experiments aimed at defining mans role as an observer 
in space also were believed to have been conducted during the 
flight including testing of a handheld optical device that 
resembles binoculars 
the mission was commanded by navy cmdr robert l gibson with 
crew members col richard m mullane lt col guy s gardner and 
lt col jerry l ross of the air force and navy cmdr william m 
shepherd 
the mission was the 27th in the shuttle program and the third 
dedicated solely to the military

at mel and sherms car dealership auto 
enthusiasts can shift time into reverse 
their business is called sentimental journey and for those 
nostalgic for the muscle cars of the 60s and 70s thats exactly 
what it is 
everyone always smiles a lot coowner sherman freund said 
people have enormous affection for these cars 
on the showroom floor is a 1966 dodge charger a 1969 mercury 
cyclone and a 1965 pontiac gto affectionately known as a goat 
the thing i like about these cars is that you know which one is 
which said john george of warren when youd see a gto going 
down the road youd say there goes a goat 
they are distinctive 
all the cars in sentimental journeys showroom were built before 
1975 when fuel economy standards went into effect in the wake of 
the 1973 arab oil embargo the cars range in price from 4500 to 
9400 but without warranties 
freund and partner mel sternfeld try to get records that are as 
complete as possible on a cars ownership and service before they 
put it on the floor and they test drive each car a few times before 
they bring it in for sale 
before the sale the men spruce up the cars paint and 
upholstery and ensure that its mechanically sound eventually 
they want to expand the business which usually has about two dozen 
cars in stock into a fullservice dealership 
we expect people who just like the cars who would be proud to 
take it out for a sunday spin or who would like to drive it in the 
summer freund said

close at 2966938 the index gained 14005 points shortly after the 
market opened but the gain gradually decreased 
dealers said news of emperor hirohito stabilizing brought out 
active market participants who had taken to the sidelines monday 
after reports that the monarch had suffered massive hemorrhaging 
there is no major economic factor that is responsible for the 
gain this tuesday morning except for news that the emperors 
condition has stabilized said one analyst with nomura securities 
japans largest brokerage 
other dealers said the surging nikkei index reflected investor 
feelings that the tokyo market was less worried and even ready to 
deal with possible higher us interest rates 
in foreign currency trading dealers said activity was slow 
mainly due to uncertainties over the outlook for us interest rates 
and hirohitos condition 
they said market players were inclined to remain on the sidelines 
in the absence of major news affecting the market but market 
sentiment is still bearish for the dollar dealers noted 
on monday hirohito discharged a substantial amount of blood and

two concealed but active faults cut giant 
swaths through the area and could cause a major earthquake in the 
nations secondlargest city says to a scientist who recommends 
that building codes be reevaluated 
the elysian park fault unknown until it caused the deadly oct 
1 1987 whittier narrows earthquake is about 10 miles wide and 60 
miles long 
it runs from santa monica bay east through beverly hills 
downtown los angeles and monterey park then southeast to suburban 
whittier fullerton yorba linda and corona said geophysicist egill 
hauksson 
while mapping the extent of that fault university of southern 
california scientists also discovered the 40by10mile 
torrancewilmington fault stretching from santa monica bay southeast 
through oil fields in torrance and los angeles wilmington district 
the palos verdes peninsula long beach and offshore from newport 
beach 
haukssons study of the faults known as thrust faults hidden by 
giant folds in earths crust was scheduled to be presented today at 
the american geophysical unions fall meeting in san francisco 
theres growing evidence that theres a fairly extensive system 
of those types of faults in the los angeles basin said tom 
heaton scientist in charge of the pasadena office of the us 
geological survey which financed haukssons study 
thrust faults have caused damaging and sometimes very large 
earthquakes in other parts of the world heaton said 
hauksson said his study suggests the five segments of the elysian 
park fault break in separate earthquakes so the largest jolts 
possible likely would measure 66 on the richter scale on a 15mile 
segment that runs under downtown los angeles and 68 on the segment 
that runs from yorba linda northwest toward whittier he added 
but hauksson said researchers cant rule out the possibility the 
entire fault could snap at once in a major 75magnitude jolt that 
would cause worse damage in los angeles than the longfeared 
8magnitude big one on the more distant san andreas fault 
it took only a fourmile segment of the elysian park fault to 
trigger the magnitude 59 whittier quake which with its 53 
aftershock killed eight people injured about 200 and caused 358 
million in damage 
the torrancewilmington fault could produce a quake with a 
magnitude between 66 and 68 or so hauksson said 
seismologists still lack enough information to determine how 
frequently moderate and large quakes occur on the elysian park and 
torrancewilmington faults he added 
he said the faults pose such a shaking hazard that building codes 
should be reevaluated 
downtown skyscrapers would suffer broken windows but survive a 
66magnitude quake which would knock down a lot of old brick 
buildings hauksson said 
the faults are about 10 miles wide because thrust faults are like 
giant subterranean ramps in which ground on one side of the fault 
moves upward at an angle over ground on the other side 
for years scientists mainly feared strikeslip faults such as 
the san andreas where ground on one side jerks horizontally past 
ground on the other side such a fault triggered saturdays 50 jolt 
that left 32 people with minor injuries 
but hauksson and heaton said concealed thrust faults may pose a 
greater danger than strikeslip faults 
hauksson mapped the elysian park fault and discovered the 
torrancewilmington fault by analyzing 200 quakes mostly magnitude 
25 to 40 that shook metropolitan los angeles from 1977 to 1988 
he found 40 percent of the quakes were centered on the two faults 
a 1980 government study said the big one a magnitude 8 
great quake on the san andreas some 60 miles from downtown los 
angeles could kill up to 14000 people seriously injure 55000 
and cause 17 billion in damage 
a 1981 federal study said a magnitude 75 quake on the newport 
inglewood fault the major strikeslip fault inside los angeles 
could kill up to 21000 people hospitalize 84000 and leave 630000 
with less serious injuries 
before we knew about the thrust faults we knew the newport 
inglewood was there hauksson said now weve discovered two 
fault structures both of which are somewhat bigger than the 
newportinglewood that tells you the earthquake potential has gone 
up

the house of commons has approved a bill that would 
make all candidates for local and national elective office in 
northern ireland sign a declaration disavowing violence 
the measure which passed the house by a 27441 vote monday 
night is seen as aimed mainly at sinn fein the legal political arm 
of the outlawed irish republican army 
a proposed amendment by the opposition labor party claiming the 
bill would increase sectarian conflict in local councils in northern 
ireland and thereby assist the cause of supporters of violence was 
earlier voted down 291195 
sinn fein members elected to local councils in northern ireland 
have repeatedly voiced support for what the ira calls its armed 
struggle its guerrilla war to end british rule in the province 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite predominantly 
protestant northern ireland with the republic of ireland under 
socialist rule 
sinn fein commands about onethird of the catholic vote in 
northern ireland and captured about onetenth of seats in 17 of the 
provinces 26 local councils in may 1985 
the legislation first announced by prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservative government last year will render elected 
candidates who take the obligatory oath but then voice support for 
violence liable to court prosecution by fellow council members or 
members of the public if this succeeds they can then be 
disqualified from office for five years 
northern ireland secretary tom king the cabinet member 
responsible for the province said during the commons debate 
we cannot tolerate a situation in which people will exploit to 
the uttermost the freedoms and opportunities a democratic society 
can provide while at the same time reserving the right to kill 
maim and intimidate those who argue against them 
but kevin mcnamara labors northern ireland spokesman said sinn 
fein was preparing cynically to sign the antiviolence oath 
he added sinn fein would be able to portray itself as the only 
party that the government feels is a serious threat to its own rule 
in northern ireland this is a major moral and political boost to 
that party 
tony benn a leading labor leftist and a former cabinet member 
said there was a war going on in northern ireland not crime in 
the ordinary sense as it is presented benn said that like any 
war it would have to be brought to an end by negotiation 
the bill now goes on to what is known as its third reading when a 
commons allparty committee examine it clausebyclause 
because of the governments 100seat majority over all other 
parties combined in the 650seat house the bill is expected to pass 
its remaining commons stages without difficulty it is expected to 
become law in time for the next local council elections next may

they were offered personal tours of trump tower 
and the citys seamy underside but the gorbachevs apparently prefer 
the sights most tourists crave the world trade center the 
metropolitan museum central park 
although a soviet official said monday that soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa want to take as many 
bites as possible from the big apple they apparently have 
declined the fruit proffered by mayor edward koch and developer 
donald trump 
the mayor had said he wanted to show gorbachev the city warts 
and all because our warts are beauty marks in the soviet union 
and take him to one of his favorite chinese restaurants 
maybe i could bring the peoples republic of china and the 
soviet union closer together he mused 
trumps publicists had said gorbachev was planning to visit trump 
tower and meet the man who built it trump was to guide the soviet 
through the fifth avenue buildings glittering lobby which is 
sheathed in vivid pink italian marble and features a 1 million 
waterfall 
but when the gorbachevs itinerary was released monday koch and 
trump were not on it although they will meet gorbachev at official 
functions along with dozens of other people 
even as andrei grachev a member of the ideology department of 
the communist party central committee was telling reporters that 
the gorbachevs stops would not be divulged a christmas 
surprise he said the new york police department was spilling 
the borscht 
following gorbachevs luncheon meeting wednesday with president 
reagan and vice president bush he and mrs gorbachev will ascend to 
the observation deck atop one of the world trade center towers 
their 45car motorcade then passes the new york stock exchange 
through wall street and toward times square all in the heart of 
rush hour on avenues closed for the convenience of the visitors and 
the torment of drivers 
on thursday gorbachev attends a soviet trade show at the jacob 
javits convention center then heads across town for an afternoon 
walk in central park and a look at the metropolitans european 
paintings gallery 
police also said mrs gorbachev might visit a department store 
but they claimed not to know which one speculation has centered on 
macys and bloomingdales although a soviet official noted that 
christmas sales at the former might make a visit problematic

a federal jury ordered a utility company to pay 
228 million saying it engaged in racketeering by lying to obtain 
rate increases to help pay for its shoreham nuclear power plant 
mondays verdict awards the money to suffolk county and could 
make the long island lighting co liable for 18 billion if the 
trial judge certifies the suit a class action on behalf of all of 
the companys ratepayers 
the utility issued a onesentence statement through its attorney 
michael lesch saying the verdict was insupportable and that the 
company would appeal 
the sevenmember us district court civil jury found that the 
company and a former president wilfred o uhl violated the 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations statute by lying to 
the state public service commission on three occasions about the 
completion schedule of shoreham to obtain rate hikes 
the verdict followed a twomonth trial of the countys lawsuit 
against the utility the jury awarded 76 million in damages to the 
county for what it overpaid on utility costs because of fraudulently 
obtained rate increases in 1978 and 1984 
that amount is tripled to 228 million under the racketeering 
statue the county had sought up to 72 million in damages 
the jury rejected the countys charges that the utility deceived 
the public service commission in obtaining other rate increases in 
1975 1976 1979 and 1981 it also found no violations by three 
other former long island lighting officials who were defendants 
i think the jury spoke loud and clearly that lilco had been 
engaging in a pattern of fraud for a decade said kenneth 
mccallion the countys lead attorney a verdict in this case has 
to send a message to all parties that the fraud engaged in by lilco 
has to be a major factor for those who are considering the fate of 
shoreham 
last week in albany the state legislature let a deadline pass 
for approving a plan that would keep shoreham closed and give the 
utility 5 percent annual rate hikes during the next decade 
the utility has said that while the plan could be revived it 
would proceed toward licensing the plant 
county executive patrick halpin called the verdict a great 
victory for the county and suffolks ratepayers 
according to testimony the shoreham plant 55 miles east of 
manhattan originally had been scheduled to be in operation in 1978 
for less than 1 billion construction was completed in 1985 but 
the plant was never opened because of public opposition 
the county said the utility spent 8 billion in the construction 
of shoreham but the company said the plant cost 53 billion 
originally the county had wanted to make the suit a class action 
on behalf of all long island lighting customers but judge jack b 
weinstein limited the scope of the suit before the trial started 
after the verdict weinstein said he would accept a motion asking 
him to certify it as a classaction suit if he granted the request 
the utility could be liable for up to 18 billion he said

in trying to break the palestinian uprising 
israel is imposing collective economic punishments ranging from 
sealing up village shops to blocking farmers from tilling their 
fields a human rights group alleges 
the arab group says in a report released monday that the 
sanctions are also aimed at furthering the longterm israeli goal of 
colonizing the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the scope of the uprising gave the authorities an excuse to 
use such sanctions on a much wider indeed unprecedented scale 
says the report by law in the service of man also known as al haq 
such punishments have almost always been of a collective nature 
al haq founded by palestinian lawyers is affiliated with the 
genevabased international commission of jurists 
its report came three days before the first anniversary of the 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
more than 300 palestinians and 11 israelis have died in the violence 
al haq charges that israels sanctions are aimed at maintaining 
the occupied lands as israels secondlargest export market after 
the united states and at making any opposition to occupation 
policies prohibitively expensive 
a spokesman for the israeli military government in the occupied 
territories who spoke on condition that his name not be used 
denied that israel uses economic sanctions to punish palestinians 
collectively 
we try very hard to diffentiate between the great number of 
people trying to get away from violence and the minority causing 
trouble he said 
he said israel imposes sanctions only to prevent violence or to 
force people to pay back taxes he acknowledged however that 
curfews imposed for security reasons have prevented farmers from 
working their fields 
al haq in its report says one of the most harmful sanctions is 
a limit imposed on the amount of money palestinians can bring into 
the occupied territories and israel authorities say the move is 
intended to block money from getting to palestine liberation 
organization activists 
but alhaq noted that the blanket limit on the money palestinians 
can bring in from jordan to 200 dinars or about 600 disrupts 
businesses and institutions that keep their assets in dinars the 
jordanian currency is legal tender in the west bank 
a limitation of about 1200 each on money brought from elsewhere 
has hurt families dependent on remittances from workers overseas 
the report says 
it also notes that to stop palestinian general strikes a main 
tactic of the uprising the army has broken open closed stores at 
times it has welded shut doors of shops to prevent them from opening 
when the strikes are over 
farmers have suffered the most from sanctions imposed by the 
israelis the report says adding if a farmer is not permitted 
access to his fields in order to irrigate the crop spray it or 
harvest it the entire crop may be lost 
in the village of qalqiliya it says many crops were lost when a 
25day curfew in march and april prevented farmers from getting to 
their fields 
in several cases the report says israeli authorities prevented 
the marketing of olive oil a major moneymaker for palestinians by 
closing down olive presses and confiscating the keys israeli 
authorites say such moves are aimed at forcing tax evaders to pay up 
al haq noted that israels efforts to break a tax boycott also a 
tactic of the uprising included disrupting peoples lives by 
refusing to issue necessary papers such as business licenses and 
marriage and birth certificates unless all back taxes are paid 
the group also accused israeli authorities of seeking to undercut 
palestinian society by closing down labor union offices charities 
and other institutions israel has accused such groups of being 
fronts for antiisraeli activity 
among institutions closed are 24 west bank union offices a 
federation of charities in israeliannexed arab east jerusalem and 
the organization for the care of ecology in qalqaliya 
the sweeping nature of the measures against popular 
organizations seems to indicate an intent to undermine the 
institutional infrastructure of the palestinian population the al 
haq report says

a longtime negotiator for religious freedom in 
the soviet union says mikhail s gorbachev deserves appreciation for 
progress in that area and should be greeted with respect during his 
visit here 
he has recognized that the issue of human rights is an integral 
component of international relations and he has introduced numerous 
changes affecting these rights including the rights of believers 
said rabbi arthur schneier 
i believe he will do more said schneier president of the 
appeal of conscience foundation an interfaith effort to expand 
religious freedom around the world 
schneier orthodox rabbi at manhattans park east synagogue has 
served as a point man for 25 years in seeking greater religious 
freedom in various countries 
he returned friday from four days of meetings in moscow with 
soviet officials about religious rights on the basis of those 
talks he predicted a new liberalized code affecting religious 
communities will be presented to the supreme soviet parliament in 
april 
he added our country and our jewish community should encourage 
president gorbachev to continue in this vein 
gorbachev will be staying at the un soviet mission across the 
street from the schneiers synagogue where a plaque reads in hebrew 
and jewish hear the cry of the oppressed the jewish community 
in the soviet union 
the plaque was erected at a demonstration led by schneier in 1965 
but now 23 years later schneier said new york jews should greet 
gorbachev respectfully in recognition of the increased opportunity 
for jews in the soviet union to emigrate and practice their religion 
and their culture at home 
this was made possible schneier said by gorbachevs reform 
policies of perestroika or restructuring 
schneiers appeal of conscience foundation is a religious 
coalition founded in 1965 and includes protestant roman catholic 
and eastern orthodox leaders 
gorbachev also received praise monday at a meeting of american 
and soviet religious leaders delegates to the usussr 
emerging leaders summit in philadelphia were optimistic soviet 
clergy may be allowed to run for legislative offices 
the message is coming through loud and clear that gorbachevs 
initiatives are spilling over and touching upon religious life 
said rabbi gary zola of cincinnati dean of admissions at hebrew 
union college there is new interest in religious thought and 
religious life and the government is not only permitting it but also

a former minister was ordered to pay 16 million to 
relatives of his critically injured wife after another woman 
testified about being his longtime lover 
however the plaintiffs lawyer deemed the judgment against 
former methodist minister walker railey a mostly symbolic victory 
because railey claims hes broke 
lucy papillon 46 testified at a civil hearing monday that she 
and railey had discussed marriage during their twoyear romance and 
that he mentioned divorce 
but ms papillon a dallas psychologist maintained the plan had 
nothing to do with an attack on peggy railey 
mrs railey 40 lies in a nursing home in what doctors describe 
as a vegetative state from which she is not expected to recover she 
was attacked and nearly strangled in her garage april 21 1987 
railey who was not at mondays hearing has maintained he had 
nothing to do with the attack and was at the southern methodist 
university library when it occurred 
in civil proceedings brought by mrs raileys family state 
district judge john whittington ruled last april that railey 
intentionally knowingly maliciously and brutally attempted to 
strangle his wife and cover up his actions with a false alibi 
on monday whittington heard testimony to determine the amount of 
damages railey would pay the family 
we were very pleased with the judges verdict said bill 
arnold an attorney for mrs raileys mother billie jo nicolai 
he conceded that raileys financial status likely would preclude 
payment of the award adding 
i dont know how much money he has or how much money he will 
have in the future but im going to do my very best to see that 
whatever it is goes to peggy raileys medical expenses 
railey 41 the key figure in a case that was featured this year 
on abctvs 2020 program refused to respond to the lawsuit 
police and prosecutors said they have proof that railey former 
senior pastor of the mainstream first united methodist church lied 
about his activities on the night of the attack but that no evidence 
links him to the crime 
whittington ruled that railey should pay roughly 8 million for 
his wifes lost earnings medical expenses mental anguish and 
physical suffering and disfigurement and an equal amount as 
punitive damages 
a physician testified that mrs railey will require an estimated 
43 million in medical treatment during the next 30 years mrs 
raileys mother said her insurance policy expires in september 1989 
we do not know what well do after that she said 
railey reportedly is living in san francisco and the status of 
his affair with ms papillon is unknown despite rumors that the 
romance has cooled 
ms papillon daughter of a former methodist bishop and once a 
member of raileys flock confirmed reports leaked last year from a 
grand jury appearance that she was tied romantically to railey long 
before and after the attack on mrs railey 
she said their affair began in june 1986 and that it accelerated 
in the months before the assault 
ms papillon said she frequently accompanied railey on his 
travels in the days immediately before the attack on mrs railey 
ms papillon said she visited railey at a dallas area hotel three 
or four times but she denied that the intensified affair led up to 
an attempt to dispose of raileys wife 
she indicated raileys relationship with his wife was functional 
at best and said that until their extramarital affair he did not 
know what he did not have 
other witnesses portrayed railey as cold and insensitive while 
describing his wife as vibrant active musically talented and a 
wonderful mother of two young children

security for soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
visit will be extremely tight with 6600 police officers working 
overtime in part because of the citys history of antisoviet 
incidents 
security will be probably as comprehensive and as important as 
any visit we have had in years and years gillian martin sorensen 
the citys liaison to the united nations said monday 
gorbachev was to arrive in the city today on wednesday he is 
scheduled to address the general assembly and have lunch with 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush 
among gorbachevs expected sightseeing stops on thursday are the 
javits convention center the metropolitan museum of art and central 
park he departs for cuba on friday 
during his last visit to the united states the soviet leader 
made an unexpected stop in downtown washington to greet the 
lunchtime crowd police chief robert johnston jr indicated the new 
york police are prepared for such an occurrence 
we have contingency plans he said 
another security concern was the possibility that while her 
husband was politicking raisa gorbachev could swoop into the 
shopperswollen aisles of macys or bloomingdales 
the police department also must be prepared for antisoviet 
incidents 
on sept 2 1986 a tear gas bomb forced the opening night 
audience for the moiseyev dance company to flee from the 
metropolitan opera there was a bomb scare when the bolshoi ballet 
opened at lincoln center in july 1987 a car at the soviet 
residential complex in the bronx was firebombed in 1984 
five protest groups have obtained permits to demonstrate outside 
the united nations during gorbachevs appearance before the general 
assembly including the coalition for soviet jewry the students for 
soviet jewry and organizations representing afghans ukrainians and 
armenians 
johnston said 6600 officers will be assigned to work overtime on 
the visit at a cost of more than 1 million 
we are going to document every cops assignment and apply for 
reimbursement to the state department he said 
the police will coordinate with the secret service the state 
department and the united nations 250member police force 
when asked to characterize the force that will be in place 
anthony oconnell the united nations security chief said the 
standards of security that are normal at this headquarters for the 
visits of heads of state 
when about 90 heads of government attended the united nations 
40th anniversary hundreds of city police teams of police scuba 
divers helicopter patrols and mounted officers watched the events 
conscious of possible terrorist attacks 
the police harbor unit stationed patrol boats off the un 
complex on the east river around the clock teams of police divers 
performed daily searches of the riverfront piers for bombs 
the citys biggest and most costly security and crowd and traffic 
control operation was the october 1979 visit of pope john paul ii 
the twoday papal visit involved more than 13000 city police 
officers and cost more than 3 million

a us immigration official has been arrested for 
approving hundreds of fraudulent identity cards for farmworkers 
seeking amnesty in exchange for more than 250000 in bribes 
authorities said 
joseph gourgue an adjudicator in the hialeah legalization office 
of the immigration and naturalization service accepted the money in 
exchange for processing 500 to 600 doctored identity cards under the 
special agricultural workers amnesty program according to an 
affidavit filed monday in us district court 
unfortunately the saw program as enacted by congress is highly 
vulnerable to fraud said perry rivkind ins district director 
most immigration officials and employees are hardworking honest 
people however some may be motivated by greed along with a lack of 
integrity as in other professions 
gourgue was arrested friday on a charge of bribery of a public 
official and was being held on 100000 bond at the federal 
metropolitan correctional center 
according to the affidavit by ins special agent william h 
morris gourgues duties included approving or rejecting temporary 
work permits and residency cards under the program that offered 
amnesty for agricultural workers who are illegal immigrants 
the program which expired nov 30 was part of the immigration 
reform control act of 1986 it was designed to make it easier for 
agricultural workers to become us citizens 
we had reason to suspect gourgue of being involved in an 
unlawful scheme to approve saw petitions knowing them to be 
fraudulently filed the affidavit said 
ins clerk yacenda ambrose who worked with gourgue revealed 
details of the scheme to ins agents on sept 27 the affidavit said 
ms ambrose who was not accused of wrongdoing told them she was 
paid 500 to 1000 per week to assist gourgue 
she stated that he used her to create saw identification cards 
for aliens who had not been properly adjudicated as eligible the 
affidavit said 
gourgue claimed that he had so processed between 500 to 600 
such applications for 500 cash payment apiece he acknowledged that 
he paid yacenda ambrose to assist him it said the transactions 
took place between june 3 and sept 23

richard m daley steps into this citys mayoral 
race as the apparent frontrunner but gaining the office his father 
held for 21 years may be difficult 
daley cook countys top prosecutor formally announced monday he 
would seek the office that richard j daley held from 1955 until his 
death in office in 1976 but opponents said the daley dominance is a 
thing of the past 
the mayors office is not an heirloom to be passed on from one 
generation to the next acting mayor eugene sawyer said 
however an october gallup poll showed the 46yearold daley who 
last month overwhelmingly won a third term as states attorney with 
a commanding 15point lead over alderman tim evans his closest 
pursuer in a crowded field 
sawyer whos expected to announce his candidacy within a week 
was 12 points behind evans and had support of just 10 percent of 
those polled 
daley rejected criticism that his successful bid would mean a 
return to the machinestyle politics practiced by his father who 
used patronage jobs to maintain a political army and keep control of 
the mayors office the elder daley exerted such influence in local 
and national democratic circles that he was called boss and 
kingmaker 
first of all my father died in 1976 they critics should get 
on with it daley said at a news conference 
im proud of my name daley said my father was a great 
mayor and a great father but all the candidates have to run on 
their record and ive got a record both as a states attorney and 
a state senator 
daley is the seventh candidate to enter the democratic primary 
and the fourth white in a city that made harold washington its first 
black mayor in 1983 and has split its vote along racial lines since 
while the daley name lent immediate credibility to his bid the 
lessons he learned in a 1983 mayoral try may prove more significant 
in that years democratic primary daley split the white vote 
with thenmayor jane byrne coming in third and catapulting 
washington into the mayors chair 
but in an almost complete reversal of events washingtons death 
last november has fractured the black voting bloc that was so 
unified behind the former congressman and neither evans nor sawyer 
who are black appear willing to step aside 
daley however rejected notions that he could win simply by 
appealing to whites who make up about half the citys population 
im not interested in running as the white candidate or 
serving as mayor for half the people said daley 
fighting crime is not a white issue or a black issue schools 
is not a white or black issue protecting taxpayers is not a white 
or black issue 
the democratic primary is scheduled for feb 28 the special 
election set last month by the illinois supreme court to complete 
washingtons second term follows on april 4 
evans had no immediate reaction said his press secretary 
sharon jenkinsbrown but another democratic challenger alderman 
danny davis predicted a voter backlash because of daleys 
willingness to leave his states attorney post so soon after his 
reelection 
the other democratic candidates are aldermen edward burke and 
lawrence bloom former chicago park district superintendent edmund 
kelly and former state sen james taylor 
city gop leaders were still looking for a candidate though at 
least one republican edward howlett has announce plans to run for 
the partys nomination

leaders said in statements released today that they will meet in 
pakistan for more facetoface talks following two days of 
unprecedented meetings in saudi arabia 
the saudi press agency released statements from both delegation 
leaders soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov and afghan 
guerrilla leader burhanuddin rabbani saying the talks would resume 
shortly in pakistan

pakistan is one of the main supporters of the guerrillas seven 
guerrilla groups form a loose alliance headed by rabbani that is 
based in peshawar pakistan a city near the afghan border 
the news agency said the soviets renewed a pledge to adhere to a 
un accord and withdraw their troops from afghanistan by feb 15 
and possibly earlier it said vorontsov made the promise during a 
meeting with king fahd of saudi arabia 
the delegates issued their statements late monday their talks 
were held saturday and sunday in the mountain resort of taif 
the statements indicated that the talks focused on the issue of 
an interim government in afghanistan and that both sides needed time 
for consultations before talks resume rabbani also stressed a 
demand for war reparations 
moslem guerrillas have been at war with afghanistans 
sovietbacked government for nine years soviet troops intervened in 
december 1979 and began withdrawing in may after the signing of the 
geneva accord 
the guerrillas did not sign the accord and the soviets have 
suspended their troop withdrawal because of guerrilla attacks 
reporting on the meeting with king fahd the press agency said 
vorontsov affirmedwhat was previously declared by the the 
soviet presidentof the determination of the soviet union to pull 
out its forces from afghanistan at the defined time and perhaps 
before that 
rabbani said he and his delegation entered the talks on the basis 
of the principles that afghanistan was and would remain an 
independent free islamic state and that the soviet withdrawal was 
mandatory the news agency said 
vorontsov said he came to taif to fulfill moscows will to give 
new momentum to the settlement adding we believe the meetings 
were useful and will contribute to ending the war and the 
formation of an afghani government on a wide basis

the political opposition today demanded 
a full investigation into an incident at a nuclear power plant that 
accidently released radioactive steam into the atmosphere a year ago 
it is time for a full accounting to be made in parliament 
said harald schaefer a leader in the opposition social democratic 
party 
he called on federal environment minister klaus toepfer to 
address parliaments environmental committee which is to examine 
the incident at a hearing on wednesday 
schaefer also demanded stricter regulatory guidelines dealing 
with reactor safety 
the calls from the social democrats and the environmentalist 
greens party followed disclosure monday that personnel at the biblis 
nuclear power plant near frankfurt had overlooked a malfunction in 
the reactors cooling system for 15 hours in december 1987 
officials on monday confirmed that biblis workers scrambled to 
correct a malfunctioning valve for a reactor cooling system hours 
after the problem was first detected but they denied there could 
have been a dangerous loss of coolant or that there was a coverup 
acknowledgment of the accident came after the us magazine 
nucleonics week issued a report on the malfunction 
manfred popp state secretary in the hesse state ministry for 
environment and nuclear safety said monday that on december 16 
1987 a valve in one of four cooling systems at the 1200megawatt 
facility remained open after the reactor was restarted 
a technical defect had kept the valve open popp said 
he said a light went on indicating the valve was open but that 
workers apparently didnt take it seriously popp said the 
reactor was operating normally and there was no other sign the valve 
was open a second valve in the cooling system was operating 
properly he said 
according to popp the third shift noticed the valve had not 
closed and in response began shutting down the reactor 
popp said a few liters of radioactive steam were released 
into the air when the second valve was opened slightly to take 
pressure off the malfunctioning one 
but he said the release was far below the level of radioactive 
emissions permitted by law and the reactor was safely shut down 
again 
the west german federation for environment and protection of 
nature said the incident in biblis could have come within a 
hair of a serious nuclear accident 
but popp insisted there was never any danger of a nuclear 
meltdown environment minister toepfer said the incident was 
reported to authorities in accordance with government regulations 
he said the incident was rated for urgent attention by 
regulatory authorities at the time 
toepfer said about 12 such urgent incidents are listed each 
year for investigation 
he said new control measures to avoid similar incidents have been 
implemented and others are under consideration 
the biblis reactor located in the rhine river valley about 30 
miles south of frankfurt first went on line in 1974

i dont think weve had a loss like this happen before in the 
mediterranean gillet said its always a blow when we lose a 
general officer he traveled a lot met a lot of people and was a 
very popular commander throughout the 16th air force 
its a very personal loss for a lot of people here at 
torrejon he said 
harpe became commander of the 16th air force in july 1987 gillet 
said the 16th air forces vice commander col leonard c ekman 46 
had stepped in as acting commander

an anonymous phone call led police to a california 
scientist who fled 18 months ago while awaiting trial on fraud 
charges stemming from his job at a nuclear weapons research 
facility officials said 
police lt john summers of suburban chandler said ronald k 
stump 49 was arrested without incident monday in his motor home 
he was sought by the fbi on a warrant charging him with unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution 
summers said stump apparently had been living in the motor home 
which was parked behind a service station 
stump worked at lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
livermore calif for more than 25 years when he disappeared in 
april 1987 the department of energy facility 40 miles east of san 
francisco designs us nuclear weapons 
but fbi agent chuck latting in san franciso said said the fbis 
interest in the scientist stemmed less from his topsecurity rating 
and nuclear research than his flight from trial 
he was just able to get some bucks and he flew the coop 
latting said people around here got real exercised wondering how 
come we didnt put every agent in the world out to find him and we 
knew that if we went through a normal fugitive investigation that we 
would get him and thats what we did 
stump was charged with fraud for his alleged role in the 
laboratorys 1983 purchase of a 250000 machine that didnt work 
assistant us attorney rodolfo orjales in california said 
earlier this year that stump may have worked out a kickback deal 
with a partner of the company that sold the equipment to the 
laboratory 
stump who filed for bankruptcy in 1980 owed 10000 to the 
partner 
officials said stump had access to the laboratorys topsecret 
tritium facility and other national clearances but latting said 
stump never was considered a national security risk even though he 
left the country tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen used in 
some forms of nuclear bombs 
apparently he was not handling any military classified material 
or doing any classifiedtype work although he was technically very 
qualified latting said 
allegations that federal authorities failed to investigate 
stumps disappearance and other employee violations at livermore and 
other laboratories have prompted an investigation by a house 
subcommittee 
livermore administrators were worried about protecting the labs 
public image and chose to let stump go free rather than risk 
unfavorable publicity according to investigators on the labs 
security force and in congress

when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
lunch in new york on wednesday with the outgoing and incoming 
american presidents afghanistan is likely to be the most divisive 
issue they discuss 
a possible soviet refusal to fulfill its commitment to withdraw 
its troops from afghanistan by a feb 15 deadline could present to 
george bush his first foreign policy challenge he will be sworn in 
just 26 days before that date 
any such move by the soviets clearly would get bushs relations 
with the kremlin off on the wrong foot 
the luncheon will take place amid official predictions that both 
president reagan and bush will encourage gorbachev to meet the 
deadline 
i think theyve made the decision to get out of afghanistan 
vernon walters us ambassador to the united nations said on 
cbstvs this morning program today i think theyre going to 
stick with it 
bush however has said he has no intention of trying to upstage 
the boss it will be president reagans meeting bush has said 
since the geneva accords which spell out terms of the soviet 
withdrawal were signed last april moscow and washington have been 
accusing each other of violations 
the soviets maintain that us and pakistani support for the 
afghan rebels has been excessive while the reagan administration 
insists the soviets are guilty of a similar infraction with their 
backing for the communist regime in kabul 
adding to the drama about whether the soviets will comply was an 
announcement by moscow in early november that it was suspending the 
removal of troops 
this did not constitute a violation since the agreement sets only 
two deadlines moscow complied with a promise to have half of its 
more than 100000 troops back home by aug 15 the next deadline is 
feb 15 but the pace of the second phase of the withdrawal is up to 
the soviets 
thus far the conventional wisdom is that the soviets will meet 
the deadline while doing everything it can in the interim to bolster 
the kabul regimes military and political position 
most analysts believe that gorbachev long ago made a political 
decision to withdraw from afghanistan to reverse that course now 
would expose gorbachev to international indignation and would mean 
continued soviet military involvement in a war which soviets 
apparently have concluded was both costly and unwinnable 
still the soviets seem genuinely anguished by the level of 
american and pakistani backing for the mujahedeen rebels 
in september soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
as soon as the soviet troops began to withdraw a nonstop 
production line of violations was set in motion 
other soviet foreign ministry officials have raised the 
possibility the feb 15 deadline might be ignored to guard against 
that outcome the state department has been urging the rebels to 
exercise restraint toward soviet troops 
the reagan administration has promised continued support to the 
mujahedeen rebels so long as moscow continues its backing for the 
afghan government 
bush has indicated he plans to continue the reagan policy a 
point he made two days after his election when he met with the 
leader of the afghan rebel alliance burhanuddin rabbani

scientists offered a warning as they 
celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of the pioneer 12 
space probe which has helped demystify the cloudshrouded planet 
venus 
venus is not a living breathing example but a very dead 
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like said donald hunten 
a professor of planetary sciences at the university of arizona 
venus has a history that suggests devastation by an extreme 
greenhouse effect and extensive naturally occurring stratospheric 
pollution damage that researchers said may have particular meaning 
for the earths inhabitants 
but the words of warning monday were mixed with messages of 
congratulation the success of the mission originally expected to 
last for 243 days has delighted researchers who now predict that 
the spacecraft will continue providing information for four more 
years before its fuel supply runs out 
the spacecraft has already generated 10 trillion pieces of data 
researchers are seeking clues to the mysterious planet which is 
similar in size mass and density to the earth scientists wonder if 
there are clues to the earths future buried in the 5 billionyear 
history of venus 
venus however is much closer to the sun than is earth 672 
million miles compared with 93 million miles 
so far the probe has helped map 93 percent of venus searinghot 
surface and helped to reveal continents high mountains and deep 
canyons like the earths ocean trenches 
pioneer 12 has provided a new understanding of volcanic activity 
and land formation on earth and has also revealed a severe 
greenhouse effect on venus that researchers believe may be the cause 
of a surface temperature of 900 degrees fahrenheit 
we used to think when i was in school that venus and earth were 
twin planets said hunten more recently weve discovered they 
are really not very alike at all 
it appears to have been 4 billion years since venus which has no 
oceans today may have had enough water vapor to form one he said 
information now suggests that high temperatures from the planets 
greenhouse effect in which clouds or airborne pollution trap the 
suns heat near the planets surface may partially account for the 
differences between venus and earth researchers said 
additionally extreme stratospheric pollution on venus where 
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1000 times the concentration 
found above earth could further explain conditions on venus and 
provide an warning for our own future 
what i think it means to earth is that we have to take these 
threats to heart said hunten we should not ignore these 
warnings these two examples of stratospheric pollution and the 
greenhouse effect are real it is happening on the earth 
scientists who gathered at nasas ames research center to 
celebrate the missions anniversary also urged a return to unmanned 
probes in addition to the far more costly manned missions now 
popular 
steven dorfman of hughes aircraft co a major government space 
contractor called for a return to a mix of small and large 
programs pointing out that the pioneer project was relatively 
cheap at less than 200 million in todays dollars 
dorfman said the us sent 36 planetary launches aloft in the 
1960s but only 11 in the 1970s and just two are scheduled for this 
decade 
next year the magellan mission will team up with pioneer to 
provide high resolution radar mapping of the geography of venus in 
february 1990 pioneer will team up with the galileo orbiter as it 
passes venus on its way to jupiter 
pioneers unique variable orbit which responds to the effect of 
solar gravity on venus has allowed the spacecraft to come as close 
as 150 kilometers 93 miles to venus and as distant as 2300 
kilometers or 1426 miles

a federal judge reversing a jury award of 16 
million to a man who said he got aids from a hemophilia drug said 
the jurors may have relied more on their emotions than the facts in 
the case 
us district judge orinda evans on monday reversed the october 
ruling against miles laboratories saying in her 14page ruling that 
aids victim randy l jones did not present sufficient evidence of 
negligence by the company 
while the court understands fully and shares the jurys great 
sympathy for the jones plight it is the courts responsibility to 
disallow a verdict which has no basis in law or fact evans said 
an attorney for jones said he would appeal to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals 
jones 35 of douglasville contended in a lawsuit that a drug he 
took in 1983 made by a division of the elkhart indbased miles was 
contaminated with the aids virus and caused him to develop the 
disease 
miles manufactures koate a bloodbased clotting product which 
jones took to control a mild case of hemophilia after surgery at 
clayton general hospital two years later he was diagnosed as 
infected with the aids virus and in 1987 he was told by doctors 
that he had developed the deadly disease itself 
jones contended the drug he took had been contaminated by the 
plasma of an unemployed texas man with aids the man allegedly sold 
plasma 40 times to a plasma center in austin texas which in turn 
supplied miles the man died of aids less than six weeks after his 
last plasma sale in september 1983 the suit said 
jones alleged that more than 60000 vials of koate were 
contaminated with the aids virus because of the man and accused 
miles of negligence in acquiring and using the tainted plasma 
miles which denied any negligence argued that it had initiated 
a highrisk donor screening program in february 1983 months before 
jones took the drug 
evans said there was a possibility that jones could have gotten 
the aids virus from other blood factor products he had taken 
duncan barr the san francisco attorney who argued the case for 
miles praised the judges decision the overwhelming tragedy of 
this case obviously affected the jurys decision and the judge has 
stepped forward to do the correct legal thing he said 
george h connell jr jones attorney said he didnt understand 
why evans ruled as she did to me shes wrong so youre asking 
the wrong person he saidjones he said is a pretty strong 
man he thinks hes right and wants to pursue the appeal 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome cripples the bodys 
immune system leaving a person prey to deadly cancers and other 
infections

families of afghan officials have 
begun moving out of kabul because guerrillas are choking the flow of 
essential supplies to the capital western diplomatic sources said 
today 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
families appeared to be moving to mazarisharif capital of balkh 
province about 40 miles from the soviet border 
various sources have reported major building activity in the 
northern city in recent months 
one diplomatic source said he had reliable information that over 
the past four weeks the afghan state security agency known as khad 
removed the bulk of its files from kabul 
the russians are presumably trying to protect all those who 
have collaborated with khad over the years the source said 
moscow agreed in a unbrokered accord in the spring to withdraw 
all of its more than 100000 troops from afghanistan by feb 15 
half those forces left by aug 15 but the pullout has since 
stalled because the soviets accuse pakistan and the united states of 
violating the pact by continuing their support for the guerrillas 
the guerrillas have made major gains especially in eastern 
afghanistan since red army troops began leaving the area most 
recently they have cut key supply routes to the capital especially 
the road running west from the pakistan border 
western diplomats said bread and meat are in short supply in 
kabul and that there are long lines at fuel stations for diesel and 
kerosene 
several communist officials have been sent to eastern nangarhar 
province with large amounts of money to try to buy the support of 
local shinwari tribesman diplomats said 
if successful the tribesmen would be used to assist in 
reopening the road from the provincial capital of jalalabad to the 
pakistani border said one source 
most observers predict the afghan government will fall shortly 
after the soviets have left the country 
guerrilla leaders based in pakistan have shunned numerous appeals 
from president najib to negotiate peace and have rejected all 
suggestions of sharing power with the communists 
the rebels held their first highlevel meetings with soviet 
officials last weekend in saudi arabia western diplomats said it 
was a sign moscow had abandoned hope of keeping its afghan clients 
in power 
according to statements distributed through the saudi press 
agency soviet deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov and guerrilla 
leader burhanuddin rabbani agreed to meet again soon in pakistan 
the agency said vorontsov reiterated moscows pledge to be out of 
afghanistan by feb 15

a guard at a fastfood outlet said he was 
ordered to drag an unconscious homeless patron onto the street 
where the man later died but the owner of the restaurant denied the 
act was company policy 
joseph eaton died early saturday on the sidewalk outside the 
24hour fastfood eatery where he lay for several hours as scores 
of people walked by but never offered help the 38yearold man came 
from a prominent boston family but his last years were troubled by 
alcohol abuse and the loss of his lover to aids 
if somebody was unconscious and we put him out on the sidewalk 
in front of the restaurant and watched him die then we should be 
taken out and shot ourselves said tom thompson one of the owners 
of the carls jr franchises in san francisco 
thats not our policy to carry people out of the restaurant 
they have to walk out or we call the police thompson added 
but guard george waters who was homeless himself before thompson 
offered him a job 3 years ago said in an interview sunday that he 
had followed the orders of the restaurants shift manager who was 
identified only as dan 
the shift manager was reported not to be at work monday and could 
not otherwise be reached for comment 
waters said it was his responsibility to eject street people 
drunk people and that he had done so before at carls 
waters said he found eaton slumped over a burger at a restaurant 
table and assumed he had passed out from alcohol 
waters said he tried unsuccessfully to wake eaton shaking him 
just as hard as you can shake a car 
waters said eaton was breathing when he dragged him out to the 
sidewalk just after midnight friday and he figured eaton would 
sober up and get up and move on because it gets kind of chilly 
when that wine wears off 
waters said he noticed several times in the next few hours that 
eaton hadnt moved but believed he was sleeping 
if id known he was sick or something like that i would have 
called the paramedics i would never have put him out 
a spokesman for the san francisco coroners office said autopsy 
results on the cause of death were inconclusive the preliminary 
coroners report showed apparent fresh needle marks on eatons arms 
and records indicate he was arrested in 1982 by san francisco police 
on a drug possession charge 
it was 5 am when the rev thomas flowers came upon eaton 
someone he saw several times a week at his soup kitchen he said he 
couldnt see any breathing 
i put my hand on his back and it was very cold i felt for a 
pulse and there wasnt one he said 
unfortunately this kind of thing happens all the time said 
flowers we have a lot of people who die in doorways and other 
places 
if eaton had been a middleclass person at a restaurant 
anywhere else in town and passed out theyd have called for an 
ambulance or the cops if he was drunk and passed out they wouldnt 
just throw him out onto the sidewalk and let him lay there and die 
police spokesman jerry senkir said the case was not under 
investigation by police 
eatons grandfather was charles freedom eaton jr chairman 
emeritus of eatonvance group mutual fund and founder of investors 
bank and trust co of boston joseph eaton attended prep schools in 
connecticut years later he developed a problem with alcohol said 
his brother henry a boston reporter 
joseph eaton also was gay and his lover died of aids a year ago 
after which eaton began to drink again after having not touched 
alcohol for five years his brother said 
he apparently had been living on the streets since nov 12 after 
his roommate asked him to leave because of his drinking

foreign minister shimon peres said today he 
would ask his leftleaning labor party to reverse itself and permit 
talks with the rightwing likud bloc on forming another coalition 
government 
peres made the announcement after meeting with president chaim 
herzog a veteran labor lawmaker who has urged labor and likud to 
form a joint government the two parties have governed in an uneasy 
coalition since 1984 
i was very impressed by what the president had to say peres 
said i told him i will propose to convene the partys central 
committee this week i will recommend to the committee to meet the 
request of the president 
the labor partys 110member executive bureau last week voted 
against negotiating with likud the 1300member central committee 
has the authority to overrule the executive bureau 
uzi baram labors secretary general said later today that the 
committee would convene thursday to vote on peres proposal 
the issue of negotiating with likud has deeply divided the labor 
party and renewed the longstanding rivalry between peres and the 
partys no 2 leader defense minister yitzhak rabin 
rabin who would likely remain defense minister in a coalition 
government has backed talks with likud 
peres position has been more ambiguous he was actively involved 
in trying to form a narrow laborled government but when he failed 
he appeared to move toward talks with likud 
in nov 1 elections likud won 40 seats in the 120member 
knesset or parliament and labor won 39 the remaining seats were 
won by 13 small factions including four religious parties that 
command 18 seats and provide the balance of power 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of likud favors a broadbased 
coalition headed by his party but he simultaneously has been 
working on forming a narrow coalition especially since the rebuff 
from labor 
two of the religious parties the torah flag and agudat israel 
today accused likud of deceiving them in coalition talks 
rabbi menahem porusch of agudat israel and rabbi avraham ravitz 
of torah flag said likud promised each party control over the 
education ministrys ultraorthodox department they made the 
allegations during a debate on israel radio 
peres criticized shamir for allegedly making too many concessions 
to his potential coalition partners especially the religious 
parties which are pushing for farreaching religious legislation 
mr shamir should first have talked to labor before negotiating 
with the small parties to whom he made so many promises peres 
said adding that a broadbased government must prevent 
legislation that will divide the jewish people 
he was referring to the socalled who is a jew legislation 
demanded by the religious parties such legislation would give 
orthodox rabbis sole authority over conversions to judaism 
the proposal has angered american jews most of whom belong to 
the reform and conservative branches of judaism dozens of american 
jewish leaders have met with shamir and peres to lobby against who 
is a jew legislation 
the ultraorthodox have also demanded several cabinet posts and 
legislation enforcing observance of the jewish sabbath which is 
opposed by the majority of israelis who are secular

stuart karl who made a fortune 
marketing jane fonda workout videotapes was placed on three years 
probation and fined 60000 for soliciting illegal campaign 
contributions for gary hart and others 
to be honest im not sure why i did these things karl said 
monday in federal court youre attracted to the allure of being 
involved in politics and people begin to make you feel important 
i just regret doing this 
us district judge alicemarie stotler said she imposed a higher 
fine than the 20000 recommended by probation officials to send a 
message to others who might follow karls example 
however she said she didnt make the sentence tougher because of 
karls cooperation with the government and because this was his 
first offense 
this is a defendant who hopefully has had his one and only 
brush with the law although it was a sensational one she said 
karl 36 once considered a star in the home video production 
industry pleaded guilty aug 2 to two counts of campaign law 
violations 
the government alleged karl asked former employees to contribute 
up to 1000 each to various candidates the legal limit then 
reimbursed them in cash the bulk of the donations went to harts 
1984 presidential campaign according to an indictment filed june 
10 hart then a us senator from colorado unsuccessfully 
challenged former vice president walter f mondale for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
karl pleaded guilty to one count of making a political 
contribution in the name of another person and one count of 
conspiracy charges involving other candidates were dismissed monday 
as part of karls plea agreement 
both karl and his attorney john vardaman claimed the 
entrepreneur was a tool of others without naming the others 
vardaman said karl had been lured into wrongdoing by promises of 
access to a presidential candidate and proximity to power 
us attorney robert bonner has said members of harts political 
campaign who encouraged the contributions were under investigation 
the orange county register has reported those under investigation 
include david rosen harts 1984 finance director and laguna beach 
developer david stein 
vardaman told the judge that karl never sought any benefit for 
himself from his manipulation of political contributions 
but assistant us attorney nancy wieben stock said karls 
business dealings benefited from his political connections 
he had forged a very successful business with the jane fonda 
videos that really stemmed from a political connection she said

public service co of colorado says it plans to end 
nuclear operations by june 30 1990 at its problemridden fort st 
vrain power plant the nations only heliumcooled nuclear reactor 
a decision on whether to convert the plant to burn fossil fuel 
will be made before the end of 1989 utility spokesman mark sieverts 
said monday 
the utility earlier announced that if it could not find 
thirdparty assistance to continue operating the plant as a nuclear 
facility it would cease nuclear operations in 1991 or 1992 the 
plant is licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission to operate 
through 2008 
sieverts said decommissioning the plant could take up to 55 years 
fort st vrain employs a heliumcooled reactor found in france 
but not elsewhere in the united states the plant began providing 
electricity in 1976 
the 330megawatt plant 35 miles northeast of denver never was 
allowed by the nrc to operate for any length of time at 100 percent 
of capacity because of problems that caused numerous shutdowns 
a spate of equipment problems in 1984 led to a 22month shutdown 
in july 1986 nrc commissioner james asselstine told a congressional 
subcommittee that fort st vrain was one of the 10 worstrun nuclear 
power plants in the nation 
in 1986 the utilitys executives ordered a 101 million 
writedown of the facility and in october 1987 a fire in its turbine 
building caused millions of dollars worth of damage 
the plant has been shut since july for scheduled repairs it is 
expected to resume electricity generation in january 
the utility said earlier it had three options for fort st 
vrains future shut it and remove everything of use convert it to 
a coal or gasfired plant or find a third party to take over the 
plant sieverts said the company is now left with the first two 
options

health secretary kenneth clarke has urged shoppers 
to carry on buying eggs but defended a subordinate who said most 
of britains egg production is affected by salmonella 
as members of the opposition labor party yelled sack her 
clarke appeared before the house of commons on monday to defend 
edwina currie the junior health minister 
she was right to stress the concern we feel about eggs said 
clarke citing 46 outbreaks of salmonella food poisoning affecting 
1000 people in england and wales traced to eggs in october 
we accept there is a health hazard which we are all tackling 
clarke said the chief medical officer tells me he had egg 
sandwiches for lunch and every healthy individual need not be too 
worried 
conservative lawmaker sir hal miller said eggs were on sale in 
birmingham city market northwest of london labeled dutch eggs 
salmonella free 
eggs were taken off the menu monday for 1000 patients at 
nottinghams queens medical center they will not be served until 
local health officials decides otherwise said assistant manager 
rosalind channon 
despite the furor an eggswallowing contest was held as 
scheduled in gloucester winner john thornton 25 swallowed 36 
hardboiled eggs in 15 minutes 
in kuala lumpur supermarkets removed british eggbased products 
from their shelves because of reports of mrs curries comments in a 
television interview saturday a store official said today 
lee fook kiong manager of weld supermarket said malaysian 
importers were to meet with the british high commission to discuss 
the problem and would restock only after approval from the malaysian 
health ministry 
britains ministry of agriculture announced producers have agreed 
to a voluntary code that includes buying chickens only from licensed 
hatcheries inspecting flocks regularly discarding cracked eggs and 
keeping eggs refrigerated most eggrelated salmonella infections 
come from dirty or cracked eggs 
furious egg producers have threatened to sue mrs currie 
according to british egg information service chairman john coles 
we have got an industry with a retail value of something like 
oneandahalf million pounds 28 billion and if we lose 25 to 30 
percent of that market the losses will be astronomical he said 
the british broadcasting corp reported only slight dips in egg 
sales 
sir donald acheson clarkes chief medical adviser told the bbc 
pregnant women infants the elderly and the sick should only eat 
eggs that have been cooked solid killing the bacteria 
for healthy adults however i think it is an acceptable risk 
its a very small one for us to continue to enjoy our boiled egg 
with a runny inside acheson said 
britons eat 30 million eggs a day produced by 39 million laying 
hens on 5000 commercial farms

greece today reneged on an extradition deal 
with italy and deported a suspected palestinian terrorist wanted for 
alleged involvement in a 1982 grenade attack on a rome synagogue 
the attack killed a 2yearold boy and injured 34 other people 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said abdel 
osama zomar left greece early today but declined to say where he 
went 
justice minister vassilis rotis said in a statement that the 
27yearold palestinian was deported to a country of his choice 
after serving two prison sentences 
in 1984 the supreme court agreed to an italian extradition 
request for zomar but it was not carried out 
the acts for which extradition is being requested are included 
in the struggle for the reacquisition of the independence of his 
country rotis said apparently referring to the palestinian 
struggle for a independent state 
the palestinian is suspected of helping to organize the september 
1982 attack on romes main synagogue 
zomar was sentenced to 20 months on weapons smuggling charges 
after his november 1982 arrest at the greekturkish border driving a 
car filled with explosives 
italian authorities filed an extradition request in 1983 for 
zomar who is said to be a member of a palestinian splinter group 
headed by terrorist abu nidal 
in march 1985 a few days before zomar was to be extradited 
greek authorities said he was suspected of masterminding a grenade 
attack against the offices of the royal jordanian airlines in athens 
but the authorities did not explain how the palestinian could 
have organized the attack from his jail cell and the charges were 
eventually dropped in december 1986 
but two months earlier zomar had been charged with concealing a 
weapon in his cell and was convicted and sentenced in march 1987 to 
another 20 months in jail 
zomar was one of three suspected palestinian terrorists jailed in 
greece who are thought to be connected with the abu nidal group 
the others are mohammed rashid 39 a palestinian wanted by the 
united states for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner and omar 
mabrouki serving a 10year jail term for trying to shoot the 
jordanian charge daffaires in 1984 
the decision to extradite rashid arrested in may has been 
delayed 
on nov 15 the supreme court indefinitely postponed its 
extradition decision because it said it lacked key documents in the 
case 
us officials have said they view rashids extradition as a test 
of greeces determination to combat international terrorism

a debtridden economy drug abuse and efforts to 
stem the growing problem of homelessness and hunger were among 
subjects tackled at the opening of the 65th national league of 
cities conference 
a call for cooperation from the white house to city halls was 
sounded monday first by gov michael dukakis who greeted the 5000 
delegates 
the issues we raised in the campaign havent disappeared 
because the election is over the former democratic presidential 
candidate said we cannot retreat 
well be out there with you on the ramparts fighting the 
battle dukakis said receiving a standing ovation 
america is choking on debt from creditcard wielding families to 
corporations paying off merger loans to the trade and federal 
deficits said three economists in a panel on the countrys economic 
future 
presidentelect george bush is going to face a legacy of the 
reagan administration in the enormous amount of debt at all levels 
of society said professor benjamin friedman of harvard university 
friedman predicted bush will have a crisis of conscience about 
keeping his campaign promise not to raise taxes 
the debt also will leave a burden for future generations who are 
likely to see a lower standard of living he said 
university of massachusets professor barry bluestone advised 
cities to concentrate on improving education worker training and 
retraining 
no single city can have an impact on global economic 
questions bluestone said 
friedman agreed cautioning cities not to lose sight of the 
longterm by sacrificing the tax base that pays for education just 
to lure companies with tax exemptions 
a city that offers good education and training will attract and 
keep a good work force he said 
tampa fla mayor sandra freedman told a standingroom crowd of 
more than 300 how she marshaled private help to demolish empty 
buildings used for drug trading and other crimes 
in may while touring tampas roughest drugdealing areas the 
mayor hit on the idea of asking private firms to help raze such 
buildings the response was better than expected she said 
a demolition firm and a trash hauler donated their services 
worth an estimated 250000 to tear down more than 50 buildings and 
take away the debris she said 
the threeday project also provided free training for 
firefighters who practiced controlled burning of the buildings 
the aftermath of the buildingrazing has been gratifying she 
said residents of those neighborhoods sleep easier now private 
property owners are tearing down their own vacant buildings and 
citizens call police with more reports of buildings used as drug 
haunts 
we know this is not the only answer to the problem but it puts 
the problem out in the open ms freedman said 
spokane wash councilwoman sheri barnard addressing a workshop 
on hunger and homelessness said her city found it useful to engage 
volunteers to find ways to help the less fortunate 
she urged her fellow city officials to solicit citizen 
participation to deal with the overwhelming problem of homelessness 
you can turn around the problems of your area ms barnard 
said

the leader of a military uprising 
was placed under arrest and his followers turned over one of two 
bases they held for five days rebels said they would give up the 
other base today news reports said 
questions persisted about whether a secret deal was made with the 
rebels who demanded an end to prosecution of officers charged with 
human rights abuses during eight years of military dictatorship that 
ended in 1983 
defense minister horacio juanarena was to brief the senate on 
wednesday on how the government ended the uprising which argentines 
considered a threat to their 5yearold democracy 
president raul alfonsin has said no concessions were made to the 
rebels in brief comments to reporters at government house today 
alfonsin stressed the need to end the revolt avoiding bloodshed 
that could have involved hundreds of argentines 
rebel spokesmen denied they surrendered and said they negotiated 
a ceasefire that allows them to return unpunished to their units 
the army said today that the rebels are at their units in 
accordance with orders of the army chief lt gen jose dante 
caridi 
it did not elaborate 
the leader of the estimated 500 rebels army col mohamed ali 
seineldin surrendered sunday night to military authorities but 
returned to the rebel arsenal later to supervise the dismantling of 
defenses including trenches and land mines at the arsenal 
on monday night he turned over the arsenal at villa martelli on 
the outskirts of buenos aires 
there had been conflicting reports concerning the timing of 
seineldins surrender initial reports said he surrendered sunday 
but unconfirmed reports later said he turned himself in on monday 
officials today said the actural surrender was sunday 
the revolt began thursday when an elite coast guard unit 
mutinied and joined troops who rebelled friday at the suburban campo 
de mayo base most of those rebels moved to villa martelli base 
saturday 
seineldin organized the dismantling of the defenses including 
trenches and land mines he and his comrades had set up at the 
arsenal 
the army in its statement today said seineldin is under arrest 
at a unidentified buenos aires garrison and will be questioned by a 
military judge no mention was made of a trial or punishment for him 
or his supporters 
more rebels were at a base at mercedes about 60 miles west of 
the capital the government news agency telam said rebels intended 
to turn over that base to the government today 
the insurrection began before dawn thursday and was the third 
military uprising in 20 months and the rebels demands including 
for a change in the military hierarchy and better pay were also 
behind the two previous revolts 
it was clear this time that the rebels had wide support 
throughout the army five bases openly supported the mutineers and 
units at several others refused to help the government 
on sunday three people were killed when civilians outside villa 
martelli began throwing rocks and bottles at the rebels who fired 
back police said la nacion newspaper said police believe many of 
the estimated 600 demonstrators were from the montonero urban 
guerrilla group 
the government had claimed victory early monday saying the 
military rebellion was over but the public was skeptical because 
seineldin and many of the renegades remained at the villa martelli 
base 
in contrast to the current situation soldiers who participated 
in an april 1987 uprising were arrested held incommunicado and 
taken to military prison soon afterward however threefourths of 
the armys top generals were removed and alfonsin proposed 
legislation limiting prosecution for human rights offenses only to 
the highestranking officers 
from 1976 to 1983 the countrys military rulers conducted a 
socalled dirty war against leftists in which an estimated 9000 
people disappeared

an american flight attendant who 
was aboard a commandeered twa jetliner testified today that crew 
members later gave misleading accounts of the hijacking 
there were so many different reports that i thought i myself 
was at a different hijacking helen sheehan 45 told the court at 
the air piracy and murder trial of mohammed ali hamadi 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem has admitted he helped hijack 
the athenstorome jetliner in june 1985 thirtynine americans were 
held hostage for 17 days and us navy diver robert stethem was 
killed during the ordeal 
hamadi has denied killing stethem of waldorf md 
mrs sheehan said she volunteered to testify at hamadis trial 
because i was very concerned that misinformation should now be 
coming out 
she did not give specific details of purported misinformation 
during her initial testimony but criticized a us television movie 
based on the hijacking saying mr hamadi was clearly shown as 
being the killer of mr stethem in my estimation that was putting 
someone on trial without giving them due process 
mrs sheehan did not elaborate on the key events of the hijacking 
or on stethems murder she said she heard the shot that killed 
stethem but did not witness the murder 
mrs sheehan said she disagreed strongly with some statements 
made by her fellow crew members after their release she also 
criticized twa management and fbi agents for the way they handled 
events immediately after the hostages were released 
we were returned to new york and we walked into a circus 
atmosphere she said 
the accounts as well as previous court testimony accised hamadi 
of beating passengers and threatening to kill them 
mrs sheehan however said hamadi sometimes acted with kindness 
to the hostages 
mr hamadi personally gave a glass of water to a us navy 
diver mrs sheehan said referring to an earlier witness clinton 
suggs 
mr hamadi also served a meal to another american who was 
badly beaten by the hijackers said mrs sheehan who added she 
still works for twa 
under court guidelines to protect witnesses sheehan was not 
asked to give her current residence 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in january 1987 after 
customs officials found liquid explosives in his luggage 
the west german government last year turned down a us request 
for hamadis extradition 
hamadis older brother abbas ali hamadi is serving a 13year 
prison sentence in west germany after being convicted of helping to 
kidnap two west germans in beirut in an effort to win release of his 
brother 
the west german hostages have since been released

visited a us navy combat barge in the northern gulf today 
carrying the message that american efforts helped end the iraqiran 
war 
the pentagon chief flew by helicopter to the barge hercules 
anchored off saudi arabia 
carlucci later flew to riyadh the saudi capital for meetings 
with senior defense officials before heading for kuwait the last 
stop on his fiveday gulf tour 
he is almost certain to be the last top reagan administration 
official to visit the gulf carlucci is thanking leaders of arab 
states that supported us efforts to protect shipping and maintain 
open sea lanes despite the war 
however it was the refusal of saudi arabia and kuwait to allow 
us bases on their territory that prompted the pentagon to lease 
the hercules and another big construction barge as offshore combat 
and supply bases 
highly secret until a few months ago the fortified barges 
supported us helicopter and gunboat patrols us officer credit 
them with halting iranian attacks on commercial shipping in the 
northern gulf for about eight months 
the second barge wimbrown 7 was taken out of service a month 
ago but us sources say hercules probably will remain on station 
until washington is convinced the fighting will not erupt again 
in bahrain carlucci delivered a personal message from president 
reagan to the emir sheik isa bin salman al khalifa and talked to 
top defense officials 
monday night he was guest of honor at a banquet hosted by 
bahrains crown prince sheik hamad bin isa bin salman al khalifa 
earlier today carlucci presented awards on the flight deck of 
the navys gulf flagship uss la salle and stopped briefly aboard the 
missile cruiser uss josephus daniels the missile destroyer waddell 
and the minesweeper fearless all in port for the occasion 
he told la salles crew that the aug 20 ceasefire ending the 
eightyear war between iraq and iran vindicated a us intervention 
policy originally condemned by critics 
results speak for themselves said carlucci through your 
actions in large measure you have helped bring an end to one of 
the bloodiest wars in history 
we have succeeded in convincing iran that terrorism on the high 
seas does not pay political dividends we have demonstrated that we 
can stand by our friends and we have demonstrated that we know who 
our friends are 
he said the largest us naval operation since vietnam also had 
demonstrated to the world our ability to project power to show 
determination and to defend vital principles including the principle 
of freedom of navigation

following the nov 17 abduction of a swiss red cross worker 
four swiss staffers of the international committee of the red 
cross left for geneva today aboard a middle east airlines plane 
said a police spokesman 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
refused to identify the staffers 
no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of peter 
winkler the 32yearold swiss red cross delegate seized by three 
gunmen in the southern port of sidon 
since the abduction eight swiss red cross employess have left 
lebanon and about 23 remain in the country 
ive advised the swiss citizens to leave lebanon sciolli 
told reporters the swiss government has banned its citizens from 
visiting lebanon for nonessential reasons 
winkler said in a handwritten note released by his kidnappers 
friday that he was abducted in order to be exchanged for a lebanese 
member of the proiranian hezbollah or party of god held in geneva 
lebanese police theorize winkler was seized to swap him for

federal employees holding sensitive spyagency 
jobs are not entitled to administrative hearings when fired as 
security risks the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the justices reversed a lower courts ruling that would have 
required such a hearing for a national security agency employee who 
says he was fired because of his homosexual activities 
the employee identified in court documents by the fictitious 
name john doe works with secret codes at the spy agency 
doe told his superiors in 1982 that he had homosexual relations 
with several foreigners during vacation travels abroad 
after a psychiatric evaluation the agency ordered him fired on 
grounds his indiscriminate sexual activities posed a security 
risk since he had access in the job he had held for 16 years to 
highly classified information 
the agency said his homosexuality was not the determining factor 
in his firing 
doe sued the agency and the secretary of defense who had upheld 
the dismissal the lawsuit claimed that the firing violated a civil 
service law entitling each federal employee to an administrative 
hearing before being fired 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled for doe last year 
but justice byron r white writing for the high court today 
said the appeals court was wrong 
white said congress never intended to require the national 
security agency to conduct such hearings for employees considered 
security risks 
white said the spy agency is authorized by law to appoint people 
to sensitive intelligence jobs without regard to the civil service 
laws 
although the authorizing law does not refer to termination 
the court has held as a matter of statutory interpretation that 
absent a specific provision to the contrary the power of removal 
from office is incident to the power of appointment white said 
the supreme court ruled in a similar case earlier this year that 
the merit systems protection board which provides job protection to 
federal workers lacks the authority to reinstate an employee fired 
for lacking security clearance 
the court in that ruling upheld the firing of an employee at a 
navy facility 
the case is carlucci vs doe 87751

has its hollywood sign but city 
fathers figured that wasnt enough of a symbol for a metropolis that 
has expanded beyond filmdom into a major economic and cultural 
center 
they wanted something impressive that would catch the eye of 
visitors something to rival the statue of liberty and where better 
to put it than between the eastbound and westbound lanes of the 
hollywood freeway towering over the citys motorists 
on monday the west coast gateway committee unveiled the winners 
of their competition to design a suitable monument two architects 
not from los angeles but from new york

the design calls for two giant aquariums with marine life fromark of 
peace and unity and the musical 
forest as well as theaters art galleries and an immigration 
museum 
patsaouras said the design is a combination of structures that 
are simple geometric figures squares cones rectangles 
connected with a fantastic engineering excellence 
he said it will be made of steel aluminum and bronze with 
cables like the golden gate bridge 
we didnt want to pigeonhole los angeles in a conventional 
sense it is a very creative design that will stand the test of 
time that was one of our objectives that 100 years from now our 
descendants will say our forefathers had vision said 
patsaouras 
mayor tom bradley launched the design contest in february for a 
monument to welcome newcomers to us shores as the statue of 
liberty in new york harbor has done for more than 100 years 
the committee chose five finalists from the 150 designs 
submitted the finalists were from massachusetts the soviet union 
austria and california in addition to new york 
the other finalists designs were a giant video screen facing 
freeway drivers towering fountains of water a design described by 
its creator as a vessel for social gathering and a giant 
transparent bird that lays an egg on the street

boston on monday and had not been told of the selection a spokesman 
said 
he knows that they were about ready to unveil the final 
selection but hasnt seen it said press secretary fred macfarlane 
the international panel that selected the monument design 
included sverre fehn an architect from norway juhani pallasmaa an 
architect and director of the museum of helsinki in finland and 
actor george takei who portrayed sulu on the former star trek

the supreme court today shattered the hopes of 
an unwed california father seeking to restore a parental 
relationship with his 7yearold daughter 
eight days after hearing arguments in edward mcnamaras case the 
court dismissed his appeal in a onesentence decision the appeal 
is dismissed for want of a properly presented federal question 
there was no recorded dissent 
in his appeal mcnamara contended that his parental rights had 
been terminated unconstitutionally by san diego authorities 
the justices had been expected to use his case to decide whether 
unwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children may be 
stripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed in the 
childrens best interest 
mcnamara who is 42 no longer was seeking custody of his 
daughter katie he wanted to reestablish a parentchild 
relationship so he could win visitation rights 
mcnamara and katies mother unidentified in court records had 
not seen each other for eight months when katie was born in 1981 
mcnamara did not learn of the pregnancy or birth until he was told 
that katie then a month old had been placed in a foster home 
awaiting adoption 
he quickly sought custody 
katie was five months old before a trial was held on mcnamaras 
custody request and a california judge ruled that it was in katies 
best interest to stay with the foster parents with whom she had been 
living 
the foster parents wanted to adopt katie and the judge ruled 
that the baby girl had bonded with them 
the judge acknowledged that mcnamara was a good parent who 
can provide a good loving home for the child 
the california supreme court reversed the ruling stating that 
custody could not be awarded to a nonparent unless awarding custody 
of the child to one of its parents who sought custody would be 
detrimental to the child 
the states highest court sent the case back to a trial court to 
determine whether the passage of time had made an award of custody 
to mcnamara detrimental for katie by then adopted 
the trial court in 1985 ruled against mcnamara and stripped him 
of all parental rights to katie the judge however encouraged 
katies adoptive parents to make mcnamara part of her life 
in arguments before the justices nov 28 mcnamaras lawyer 
contended that california law unfairly discriminates against unwed 
fathers by making it more difficult for them to assert their rights 
as parents 
san diego county had defended the states policy of giving an 
unwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a chid 
for adoption 
biology in and of itself does not create a substantial 
relationship or create a parental right lloyd harmon jr had 
argued for the county 
the case is mcnamara vs san diego county department of social 
services 875840

authorities investigating the suspicious 
deaths of eight terminally ill nursing home patients focused today 
on the means and motives of two former nurses aides charged with 
murder in two of the deaths 
the arrests of catherine may wood and gwendolyn gail graham 
followed a twomonth investigation into the deaths at the alpine 
manor nursing home in this grand rapids suburb 
investigators believed at least some of the eight residents were 
suffocated in their beds said walker police chief walter sprenger 
detectives investigated but were unable to confirm allegations 
that the suspects began choosing their victims based on initials of 
the victims names which they hoped to use to spell the word 
murder sprenger said 
walker police arrested wood 26 of grand rapids early monday 
she was arraigned on two counts of open murder before 59th district 
judge sherwin venema who ordered wood held without bond in the kent 
county jail pending a dec 16 preliminary examination 
wood could be sentenced to up to life in prison if convicted 
graham 25 was arrested sunday night in tyler texas about 100 
miles southeast of dallas she was arraigned monday in 7th district 
court in tyler on one count of open murder before judge bill coats 
who set bond at 1 million and returned graham to the smith county 
texas jail 
sprenger said he would seek grahams extradition to michigan on 
the open murder count which does not specify the degree 
wood was charged in the deaths of marguerite chambers 60 and 
edith cook 98 and graham was charged in the death of cook the two 
patients were among about 40 alpine manor residents who died between 
january and april 1987 when the eight suspicious deaths occurred 
said ginny seyferth a nursing home spokeswoman 
all eight deaths originally were attributed to natural causes 
and the bodies of three of the patients were cremated but the 
investigation which sprenger said began after woods exhusband 
gave police information about the suspected killings led last week 
to the exhumations of the bodies of chambers and cook 
autopsy results on both were inconclusive but additional bodies 
might be exhumed sprenger said 
sprenger said additional charges could be filed as the six other 
suspicious deaths are examined he said there did not appear to be 
other suspects in the case 
the police chief refused to label the deaths mercy killings but 
would not speculate on a motive a lot of this will come out 
during the trial i cannot share evidence that will be detrimental 
to the case he said 
the chief refused to say whether either woman had confessed or 
made any comment to authorities 
wood worked at alpine manor from july 1985 to october 1988 most 
recently as a supervisor of nurses aides seyferth said graham 
worked from june 1986 to june 1987 at the 208patient facility the 
spokeswoman said 
both had very good reviews seyferth said in patient 
surveys both were very wellliked by patients 
graham returned to her native texas and was hired in september 
1987 at mother frances hospital in tyler assistant hospital vice 
president beverly mason said graham was fired oct 19 after 
hospital officials learned of the investigation in michigan mason

the supreme court today saved the coal mining 
industry from paying potentially billions of dollars in additional 
benefits to miners with black lung disease 
but at the same time the justices ruled that more than 8000 
miners with pending black lung claims may be eligible to receive 
hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits 
by a 54 vote the court said that miners with less than 10 years 
of work in the mines are eligible to claim benefits if there is 
other evidence they are disabled that class of workers is estimated 
by the government to be around 8000 to 10000 miners 
but the court also overturned a lower court ruling that could 
have opened the way for claims by possibly more than 100000 miners 
seeking as much as 136 billion in benefits 
the larger group is barred from receiving benefits because miners 
in that class failed to pursue adminisrative remedies or to appeal 
to the courts within the prescribed time the justices ruled 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said congress 
never intended to exclude from benefit eligibility miners who worked 
less than 10 years 
we do not sit to determine what congress ought to have done 
given the evidence before it but to apply what congress enacted 
and the exclusion of shortterm miners from the benefitsfinds 
no support in the statute scalia said 
on the other hand he continued nothing in federal law requires 
the government to reopen settled claims 
there is not even a colorable basis for the contention that 
congress has imposed a duty to reconsider finally determined 
claims he said 
he was joined by justices william j brennan thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and anthony m kennedy 
the four dissenters agreed that settled cases should not be 
reopened but they also said that miners with less than 10 years of 
work are not entitled to the benefits 
justice john paul stevens wrote the dissenting opinion joined by 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white and 
sandra day oconnor 
the ruling is at least an important partial victory for the 
reagan administration as well as the coal mining industry 
the administration challenged a ruling by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals that justice department lawyers said could force 
tremendous additional cost on the overburdened fund that pays black 
lung benefits 
the 8th circuit court in the ruling overturned today said the 
department of labor must take a fresh look at claims that were 
denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s the appeals court had 
directed the department to use liberalized standards adopted by 
congress in 1977 to determine eligibility for benefits 
congress had previously created a special fund to pay off claims 
by miners with black lung disease also known as pneumoconiosis 
coal mine operators already owe the government some 3 billion 
that has been loaned to the fund from the federal treasury 
in other action the court 
dismissed the appeal of an unwed california father seeking to 
restore a parental relationship with his 7yearold daughter 
eight days after hearing arguments in edward mcnamaras case the 
court dismissed the appeal for want of a properly presented 
federal question 
there was no recorded dissent 
the justices had been expected to use his case to decide whether 
unwed fathers who actively seek custody of their children may be 
stripped of all parental rights if adoption is deemed in the 
childrens best interest 
ruled unanimously that federal employees holding sensitive 
spyagency jobs are not entitled to administrative hearings when 
fired as security risks 
the justices reversed a lower courts ruling that would have 
required such a hearing for a national security agency employee who 
says he was fired because of his homosexual activities 
the black lung cases are pittston coal group vs sebben 87821 
whitfield vs sebben 87827 and office of workers compensation 
vs broyles 871095

the federal government has sued the state 
of new mexico and sandoval county for allegedly failing to give 
indian voters sufficient voting information in their native 
languages 
the justice department lawsuit filed monday contends the state 
and county violated the 1965 voting rights act by failing to provide 
interpreters and voter information in the keres and navajo tongues 
keres is a pueblo indian language 
the lawsuit said 82 percent of new mexicos population and 273 
percent of sandoval countys population is indian the county 
encompasses an area from the northern suburbs of albuquerque toward 
northwestern new mexico 
i hope this litigation shakes the state up said state rep 
james roger madalena of sandoval a jemez pueblo indian 
the justice department asked the us district court to require 
state and local election officials to devise a bilingual election 
program that will assure indians equal access to voter registration 
and absentee voting and provide them information on how names are 
removed from voting lists 
the justice department also said the defendants failed to 
implement procedures to give residents of isolated navajo and pueblo 
areas the chance to register to obtain and cast absentee ballots 
and to avoid having their registration canceled 
other defendants are secretary of state rebecca vigilgiron 
sandoval county clerk nettie lucerogriego and sandoval county 
commission chairman tom swisstack 
the justice department said it sued after months of discussion 
with state and county officials in an effort to get the defendants 
to resolve the problems voluntarily 
ms lucerogriego said monday she was not aware the suit had been 
filed randy childress chief assistant new mexico attorney general 
said he had not seen the lawsuit and would have no comment until it 
could be reviewed 
ms vigilgiron said the state was warned of a lawsuit as early 
as 1987 she said her office tried to get some changes made to state 
law and had hired indians to address concerns of navajo apache and 
pueblo voters 
weve gone to great lengths to solve some of these problems 
she said 
but she said some concepts cannot be translated into all indian 
languages such as defining a constitutional amendment 
basically its an interpretation problem that we have she 
said 
madalena said keres is a spoken language only it has no 
alphabet but he said navajo is both spoken and written 
swisstack said the county had advertised for interpreters but 
nobody applied sandoval county attorney tom garde said the county 
was targeted because it has the highest percentage of indian 
residents in the state

an opposition party has charged 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriego supported the leader of a 
failed rebellion in argentina who they say was a noriega military 
adviser 
foreign minister jorge ritter on monday called the accusations 
a fairy tale 
the christian democratic party charged that argentine col 
mohamed ali seineldin left panama on a panamanian military plane 
flew to uruguay and took a boat to buenos aires to take over the 
coup 
however ritter said the argentine left the panama city airport 
on a commercial flight last week 
the insurrection that began thursday was the third army mutiny in 
20 months 
ritter also said the argentine government will show the 
falseness of versions connecting the panamanian defense forces to 
seineldins rebellion 
it seems like a fairy tale although a tragicomic one that 
every important event in latin america large or small is tied to 
gen noriega ritter said 
the christian democratic party has called for noriega to step 
down noriegas rule is also opposed by the united states where he 
has been indicted on drug trafficking charges charges he denies 
on monday acting president manuel solis palma sent a message of 
solidarity to argentine president raul alfonsin the presidential 
press office said 
seineldin was argentinas military attache in panama from 1985 to 
1987 and also served as an instructor for the defense forces 
official panamanian sources said 
sources at the argentine embassy in panama said that seineldin 
left his post as military attache in 1986 and then was invited to be 
a defense forces instructor 
in a press release issued monday the christian democratic party 
said col seineldin was a military adviser to gen noriega for 
the past two years a fact that shows a direct tie between the 
panamanian military chief and the events in argentina 
the party also claimed seineldin was involved in repressive 
actions against antigovernment demonstrators in panama 
the press release alleged that ties between noriega and 
seineldins rebellion indicate an attitude of vengeance because 
alfonsin favored excluding panama from the group of eight 
the panamanian government was excluded from the group of eight a 
group of eight latin american democracies that consult on mutual 
problems on the grounds that it was not a democracy after noriega 
removed eric delvalle as president in february

the national transportation safety board has 
published its final report on the crash of continental flight 1713 
reaffirming the boards opinion that human error caused the accident 
during takeoff in a snowstorm 
the report reaffirmed the ntsb investigators opinion that the 
crash which killed 28 of the planes 82 passengers and crew 
members including the captain and first officer was caused by the 
captains failure to deice the aircraft after a takeoff delay in 
steady snowfall 
it reiterated their opinion that confusion between the flight 
crew and air traffic controllers contributed to the accident by 
helping to delay the takeoff 
the report issued monday also restated the investigators 
belief that another contributing factor was the absence of 
regulatory or management controls which led to the pairing of the continental 
dc9 bound for boise idaho crashed on takeoff 
nov 15 1987 at stapleton international airport 
the 90page report puts in written form what the board discussed 
on sept 27 during its probablecause hearing on the crash 
the formal report reaffirms earlier findings that the accident 
resulted from a combination of errors by inexperienced pilots frank 
zvonek 43 and lee bruecher 26 and the weather 
bruecher who was at the controls was faulted for lifting the 
nose too soon and causing the plane to stall he had completed just 
36 hours of flight time including simulator practice on the dc9 
and had not flown at all in the 24 days prior to the crash 
zvonek was an experienced boeing 737 copilot but had only 
limited dc9 flight time he was faulted for failing to return the 
plane for a second spray of deicing fluid even though it sat on the 
ground in snow and freezing temperatures for 27 minutes before 
takeoff

a real estate magnate who at first made a 
bid for ptls assets thinks the price being asked for what remains 
of the evangelical empire is too high according to his spokesman 
bob ransford a spokesman for canadian peter thomas said monday 
that thomas does not plan to attend the dec 12 auction at us 
bankruptcy court in columbia 
ransford told the herald newspaper of rock hill that the 
conditions set by us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds made a bid by 
thomas unlikely 
thomas who heads the vancouverbased samoth capital corp 
expressed interest in buying ptls assets in august at a nov 17 
bankruptcy hearing reynolds rejected thomas 70 million cash bid 
because it was not high enough and it allowed him to walk away from 
the deal for up to 30 days 
ransford said thomas plans to see what happens at the dec 12 
auction and a dec 13 hearing before making any more decisions 
concerning the heritage usa park owned by ptl in fort mill 
thomas withdrawal from the auction makes canadian stephen 
mernick the leading bidder 
coffin would not comment on whether mernick had altered his 115 
million proposal a proposal reynolds ruled against because mernick 
would not make an unrefundable deposit or alter terms of a 65 
million mortgage payment

group has raised 15 million toward buying heritage usa and hopes

rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the house 
ways and means committee today suggested raising the gasoline tax 
and the amount of social security benefits subject to tax as ways to 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
however the illinois democrat emphasized that it would be up to 
presidentelect george bush not the democraticcontrolled congress 
to initiative any tax increase rostenkowski was having lunch with 
bush today 
rostenkowski whose committee has jurisdiction over taxes and a 
sizable share of federal spending programs predicted bush would 
have little trouble backing away from his notaxincrease pledge if 
he wants to do so 
rostenkowski made his remarks at a breakfast meeting with several 
reporters aides relayed his statements to other reporters 
a spokesman said rostenkowski suggested the federal gasoline tax 
now 91 cents a gallon could be raised by 10 to 15 cents a gallon 
a 15cent increase would bring in about 15 billion a year almost 
enough by itself to meet the taxincrease requirements of any 
deficitreduction package that congress and the executive branch 
might agree on 
raising the amount of social security benefits subject to income 
tax would require many politicians of both parties to abandon 
pledges not to tinker with the retirement system present law taxes 
up to half of a retirees benefits if a couple has total income over 
32000 or a single persons income is over 25000 
senior congressional democrats have repeatedly rejected arguments 
from president reagan and bush that the 150billionayear deficit 
can be reduced significantly without raising taxes however 
democrats have refused to initiate tax increases without the backing 
of the administration 
rostenkowski contends a continued high deficit will destabilize 
the economy to the extend that the nations standard of living will 
suffer 
at the meeting with reporters aides said rostenkowski also 
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the wave of 
corporate buyouts the key issue for the committee will be whether a 
full interest deduction should continue to be allowed for money 
borrowed to finance buyouts and takeovers 
rostenkowski said he has an open mind on the question aides said 
the chairman also repeated his distaste for bushs prposal to 
reduce the maximum tax on capital gains the lions share of a 
capitalgains tax cut would fall to the wealthy and rostenkowski 
contends such a move would jeopardize the consensus that produced 
the 1986 tax overhaul 
meanwhile speaking at a breakfast sponsored by the gannett co 
inc the incoming chairman of the senate budget committee predicted 
that bush would have to ask for a tax increase before the midway 
point of his term 
my view is there will be additional taxes within the next 
two years said sen james r sasser dtenn bush would again ask 
people to read my lips he said but this time hell be saying 
lets get some additional revenue in the till

within five hours of beginning a crackdown on companies with unpaid 
fines for safety violations 
we have troopers at all 10 of the truck scales in the state 
and theyre checking every truck that rolls in said lt mike 
edmonson director of the motor safety division we have a list of 
220 companies with unpaid penalties ranging from 100 to several 
thousand dollars 
state police began issuing fines after a year of warnings 
edmonson said 
we spent the entire year of 1987 issuing warnings we sent out 
over 20000 warning letters both in state and out of louisiana 
since jan 1 weve been issuing civil penalties he said 
officers will stay at the scales around the clock for an extended 
period edmonson said 
they may wait us out for eight hours or 12 hours or even 24 
but they want those trucks rolling it costs them money if theyre 
not they wont be able to wait us out forever he said 
violations include faulty brakes bad tires or lights and drivers 
who have been behind the wheel too many hours edmonson said 
were not asking them to do anything additional to operate 
their trucks than is required under state law our main concern is 
the growing number cidents in the 
state were trying to stop trucks in bad shape before they drive 
through louisiana edmonson said 
for the most part truckers comply with regulations edmonson 
said its not a large number of companies violating them but we 
dont want it to get any larger

a fired fbi agent has been jailed for refusing 
to testify against two teamsters officials charged with embezzlement 
and racketeering 
robert s friedrick was taken to the downtown justice center jail 
by federal marshals monday after he refused to answer prosecutors 
questions about his role as the agencys chief contact for late 
teamsters union president jackie presser when presser served as fbi 
informant 
us district court judge george w white who had allowed 
friedrick to remain free on 1000 bond friday after refusing to 
testify under immunity revoked the bond and asked friedrick if he 
had experienced a change of heart 
my position is the same as friday said friedrick whom the 
fbi fired in august 1986 
friedrick who could be jailed up to 18 months for criminal 
contempt conferred briefly with his attorney william d beyer 
before giving him the contents of his pockets making a phone call 
and leaving for jail 
beyer has appealed the judges contempt citation to the 6th us 
circuit court of appeals in cincinnati 
government attorneys indicated they wanted to call friedrick to 
the stand to prove that pressers fbi handlers had never 
authorized the union hiring of ghost employees who were paid for 
doing no work 
the handlers were assigned to keep in contact with presser and 
receive his informants reports on union activities 
friedrick was fired after he was indicted for making false 
statements when he told investigators in 1985 that the ghost 
employees had been authorized by the fbi in january 1986 friedrick 
admitted that he had lied about the authorization but his attorney 
has been able to suppress the admission 
stephen h jigger a government prosecutor said friedricks 
testimony was crucial because friedrick sometimes was the only one 
of three fbi presser handlers who attended meetings with presser 
and anthony hughes a codefendant and recording secretary of 
teamsters local 507 in cleveland 
hughes and harold friedman a teamsters international vice 
president and president of local 507 are charged with plotting a 
700000 scheme to hire ghost employees presser who remained 
secretarytreasurer of his hometown local 507 while teamsters 
president was indicted on similar charges but died july 9 before 
going on trial 
jigger asked the judge to consider delaying the trial to give 
friedrick time behind bars to reconsider his unwillingness to 
testify 
but white delayed such a ruling and excused the jury until 
wednesday while attorneys argued whether the jury can see some 
prosecution evidence 
as an alternative to friedricks testimony on the stand jigger 
tried but lost a bid to have three sworn statements by friedrick 
admitted as evidence the judge said the material was untrustworthy 
because of friedricks earlier conflicting statements

a moderate earthquake shook the cook inlet 
area early today but there were no reports of damage or injuries 
the tsunami warning center said 
spokesman alec medbery said the 712 am quake with a 
preliminary magnitude of 50 on the richter scale was centered 
about 50 miles west of homer and was felt as far north as anchorage 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 time 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight damage 
in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 
severe damage a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage 
the 1964 good friday earthquake in alaska measured 85 on the 
richter scale and was centered in prince william sound it generated 
large waves that devastated several coastal communities and killed 
114 people as far south as oregon and hawaii

jim bakker and a former top ptl aide 
defrauded 150000 contributors and used more than 4 million in 
contributions to the tv ministry to support extravagant lifestyles 
an indictment charges 
two other bakker aides also were indicted for alleged tax evasion 
bakker and richard dortch ptls former senior executive vice 
president used fraudulent means to sell lifetime partnerships in 
the ministrys heritage usa theme park a federal grand jury said 
monday after a 15month investigation 
a lawyer for the television evangelist said today that bakker 
will plead innocent 
bakker has indicated he is wholly comfortable with the 
honorable character of the way heritage usa was operated under his 
leadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue 
his attorney jim toms said in a telephone interview from his 
hendersonville office 
theyre written in pretty complex language he said of the 
charges its going to take some real careful study to understand 
the implications 
bakker who founded the ministry in 1972 and built it into one of 
the nations most popular evangelical enterprises and dortch are 
charged with eight counts of mail fraud 15 counts of wire fraud and 
one count of conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud for using the 
mails telephones and television 
if convicted of all the charges bakker 48 and dortch 57 each 
could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined 6 million 
bakkers wife tammy a target of the investigation was not 
indicted 
bakker left the ministry in march 1987 after admitting to a 1980 
sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn the indictment 
alleges that dortch authorized a 265000 payment to ms hahn to 
keep her quiet about the incident 
bakkers attorneys toms and ryan hovis told reporters monday 
that bakker would not have a statement for several days 
certainly theres a degree of discouragement or regret that 
criminal charges were brought against mr bakker toms said but 
hes glad to know what hes facing so he can prepare his defense 
dortch told reporters in clearwater fla where he runs a 
ministry called life challenges that he looked forward to being 
able to tell my side of the story and to put this matter behind me 
and with gods help i know that i can face the future 
us attorney thomas ashcraft declined to comment saying 
there has already been too much publicity on this already and we 
dont want any more 
ms hahn who works for a radio station in phoenix told a news 
conference she is willing to testify in court but otherwise wants 
nothing to do with the case 
i have lived with this for eight years she said i refuse 
to be a slave to this any longer 
two months after bakker left ptl his pentecostal denomination 
the assemblies of god dismissed him and dortch 
according to the indictment the bakkers received bonuses 
totaling 3465000 from 1984 through 1987 and dortch got bonuses 
totaling 550000 although they were aware ptl was in poor financial 
condition 
the bakkers returned to the charlotte area in june mounting an 
unsuccessful attempt to buy ptl which filed for bankruptcy 
reorganization three months after bakker left the ministry 
a us bankruptcy court has been trying to find a suitable buyer 
for ptls 1700 acres of undeveloped property satellite television 
network and heritage usa theme park in fort mill sc just over the 
north carolina line 
the indictment said bakker and dortch raised at least 158 
million from the lifetime partnerships sold to finance construction 
of a hotel at the theme park ptl sold the partnerships from 1984 
until spring 1987 promising free yearly lodging at the theme park 
in return for a onetime gift usually 1000 
more than 152000 partnerships were sold 
the indictment said bakker and dortch oversold those 
partnerships didnt tell partners about it and misled ptl board 
members about the ministrys finances 
also indicted monday were david taggart a former ptl vice 
president and his brother james a former interior designer for 
ptl they are accused of diverting more than 11 million in ptl 
money for their own use including 55000 in purchases from the 
cartier jewelry store in new york and not reporting the income to 
the internal revenue service 
the defendants were ordered to appear dec 15 in us district 
court 
the maximum penalty for each count of mail fraud wire fraud 
conspiracy and tax evasion is five years in prison and a 250000 
fine and five years 
on nov 10 the bakkers and david taggart were ordered by a 
federal judge in columbia sc to repay nearly 77 million to ptl 
as restitution for excessive pay and benefits they received between 
1984 and 1987 
the bakkers were ordered to repay 66 million of that bakkers 
attorneys have said they will appeal the decision

in an effort to discredit star witness hedda nussbaums 
testimony the attorney for murder defendant joel steinberg 
questioned ms nussbaum about her drug use and her involvement with 
cults and programming 
ms nussbaum who lived with steinberg for 17 years until the 
death a year ago of 6yearold lisa steinberg has directly 
implicated him in lisas death and painted him as a bullying drug 
abuser 
under questioning by defense lawyer ira london ms nussbaum said 
that hypnotic suggestions and programming led her to believe that 
she had had sex with everybody in the world 
ms nussbaum testified that she once believed in the power of 
hypnosis and of posthypnotic buzz words which when heard could 
trigger certain actions 
i was hypnotizing everyone and was using them sexually 
m nussbaum said 
at that point london asked her if he detected the beginnings of 
a smile on her face 
yes she said i just realized the absurdity of it 
her testimony came one day after state supreme court justice 
harold rothwax denied a defense motion to change steinbergs plea to 
not guilty by reason of insanity the supreme court is new yorks 
triallevel court 
london argued that ms nussbaums testimony last week convinced 
psychiatrists that steinberg was not criminally responsible for 
killing the girl 
last week ms nussbaum testified that steinberg had admitted 
knocking the girl down because she was staring at him 
we are not abandoning our defense that joel steinberg is not 
guilty of depraved indifference homicide london said 
he said he wanted his motion granted so the jury could consider a 
verdict of innocent by reason of insanity 
we are offering our motion as an alternative london said 
assistant district attorney peter casolaro strongly opposed the 
plea change calling it a strategic decision that should not be 
granted 
rothwax denied the request at least temporarily he noted that 
insanity defenses ordinarily must be filed before a trial begins and 
within 30 days after a defendant enters a plea to an indictment 
but the court has discretion to permit an insanity defense at any 
time after an indictment rothwax said he would give the defense the 
opportunity to resubmit it with proper papers 
lisas death in a household with affluent welleducated adults 
shocked many and led to a reexamination of the duty and ability of 
neighbors teachers and social workers to recognize and report 
evidence of child abuse 
in testimony monday ms nussbaum said for the first time that 
she had seen steinberg physically abuse lisa 
several weeks before the girls death she testified joel 
grabbed lisa by the arms and shoulders shook her and threw her down 
on the floor 
casolaro asked her if she had ever hit lisa or physically abused 
her 
no ms nussbaum replied 
on crossexamination london tried to suggest that ms nussbaums 
opinion of steinberg had been influenced by her lawyer barry 
scheck and physicians including psychiatrist louis opler 
the only thing that i can recall is that he opler indicated 
joel was a sociopath she said 
when london asked her if she knew what opler meant by sociopath 
she chuckled for the first time in her three days on the witness 
stand she said she did not understand at the time that it meant a 
violently antisocial personality 
under further questioning she said that when she first talked to 
scheck about testifying against steinberg she had for the most 
part a positive view of steinberg 
she testified that scheck eventually told her he was trying to 
come to some sort of written agreement about testifying against 
steinberg 
scheck said afterward that prosecutors had decided before the 
agreement that ms nussbaum had nothing to do with lisas death and 
that the agreement was not in exchange for testimony against 
steinberg 
london also asked ms nussbaum about her 36 million civil suit 
against steinberg 
were you made aware that a successful criminal prosecution 
against joel steinberg would enhance the value of your lawsuit 
london asked 
i thought one case would have no influence on the other she 
said adding that scheck had told her that

strategic air command installation 
no weapons were aboard said lt col george peck a spokesman 
for sac headquarters in omaha neb 
the crew was practicing landings after a sevenhour training

the plane doesnt land 
all three sections of the plane burned on impact said senior 
airman tim sanders a base spokesman the crew members crawled or 
were helped out of the front section of the aircraft he said they 
were taken to marquette general and base hospitals

soviet media tuesday gave prominence to mikhail s 
gorbachevs scheduled address to the un general assembly rather 
than his planned meetings with president reagan and presidentelect 
george bush 
the official tass news agencys stories on the 57yearold 
presidents departure for new york said only that he would speak to 
the world body on wednesday and did not mention his sessions the 
same day with the us leaders 
other tass stories reported bushs remarks monday that he was 
eager to move relations with the soviet union forward and comments 
by americans about gorbachevs trip 
while tass issued a separate story praising the decision of us 
television networks to cover gorbachevs arrival in new york live 
staterun soviet tv didnt show his departure from moscow until 
three hours later 
in a traditional sendoff members of the ruling politburo stood 
and waved on the tarmac of moscows vnukovo 2 airport as gorbachev 
and his wife raisa walked to their plane at midday tuesday the 
sky was overcast and wet snow made the ground slushy and all the 
officials wore fur hats 
the soviet media did not report gorbachevs itinerary and gave 
only a general idea of what he would discuss in new york tass said 
he would speak with reagan and bush about arms limitation and 
reduction human rights a settlement of regional conflicts and the 
development bilateral relations 
as for the un speech and meetings with reagan and bush the 
clearest hint for soviets of what their leader might propose was a 
reference in the red armys newspaper krasnaya zvyezda on tuesday 
to the possibility the soviet union will reduce the size of its 
armed forces the article mentioned gorbachevs speech and his 
meetings with reagan and bush but it did not make clear whether 
gorbachev would announce an armed forces reduction or provide 
details of the step 
radio moscow gave only this tantalizing preview in an 
international broadcast its presumed that during his stay in new 
york mikhail gorbachev will advance new initiatives 
the evening newspaper izvestia said in a frontpage story tuesday 
that the big question in new york was what proposals or offers 
gorbachev would make 
the answer is given in various forms but with one thought 
wait just a little longer on dec 7 all will become known the 
newspaper said 
in a dispatch by a diplomatic correspondent distributed after 
gorbchevs departure tass said the soviet leader intends to discuss 
the entire range of ussoviet issues with reagan and bush 
the soviet leadership intends to talk about important 
substantive matters concerning real political cooperation between 
the two countries on the broadest range of problems including the 
state of affairs and prospects for further headway in the fields of 
arms limitation and reduction human rights a settlement of 
regional conflicts and the development of bilateral relations 
the dispatch said 
gorbachevs decision to address the united nations was a sign of 
soviet regard for the world body as an indispensable mechanism in 
the quest for a peaceful solution to international issues for 
resolution of crisis situations and for settlement of other global 
problems tass said 
in several reports monday the media emphasized the new style of 
soviet diplomacy and the need for speedy progress on arms control 
issues when bush takes office in january 
bush has said he will meet with gorbachev in his capacity as vice 
president not as presidentelect so as not to overshadow reagan 
before he leaves office next month but virtually all soviet reports 
about the session referred to bush only as presidentelect and they 
stressed the importance of the meeting in continuing improvements in 
relations in the bush administration 
gorbachev was accompanied by foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze politburo member alexander n yakovlev and deputy 
premier vladimir kamentsev

dont play president youre not old 
washington hand donald h rumsfeld advises those who will serve at 
the side of george bush the constitution provides for only one 
president 
assume that most everything you say or do will be on the front 
page of the washington post the next morning he tells those who 
will move into the white house in january 
learn quickly how to say i dont know he adds if you 
foul up tell the president and others fast and correct it 
and this calming piece viewpoint from the inside the white 
house more than occasionally looks as untidy as the inside of a 
stomach dont let the perspective you have which is unique or the 
buffeting you receive panic you it probably looks better and is 
likely going smoother than it may seem from where you sit 
while holding a halfdozen jobs over two decades in three 
republican administrations rumsfeld jotted down his observations on 
how to work for and around presidents without getting 
presidentialsized egos 
when he joined former presidents carter and ford scholars and 
other former government officials in writing american agenda a 
compendium of policy advice for presidentelect bush rumsfeld 
pulled out his bits of washington wisdom they make the final 
chapter of the bluecovered briefing book 
many of rumsfelds rules deal with keeping the ego in check 
and reflect lessons learned through service directing richard 
nixons office of economic opportunity and the wageprice control 
program and as nixons ambassador to the north atlantic treaty 
organization as fords chief of staff and secretary of defense and 
as president reagans middle east envoy 
samples 
dont speak ill of your predecessors or successor you did 
not walk in their shoes 
dont begin to believe you are indispensable or infallible 
and dont let the president or others think you are youre not 
dont speak ill of other members of the administration 
never say the white house wants buildings dont want 
one price of proximity to the president is the duty to bring 
bad news you fail him and yourself if you are unwilling to do 
so 
dont forget that the 50 or so invitations you receive a week 
are sent not because those people are just dying to see you but 
because of the position you hold if you dont believe me ask one 
of your predecessors how fast they stop 
dont take the job or stay in it unless you have an 
understanding with the president that you are free to tell him what 
you think on any subject with the bark off and the freedom in 
practice to do it 
work continuously to reduce the number of people who have 
white house phones white house stationery white house mess 
privileges and the like only those who see the president 
frequently say three or four times a week should be in a position 
to represent themselves as being white house staff 
simply because a problem is shown to exist it doesnt 
necessarily follow that there is a solution

federal grand juries are delving into 
allegations that some doctors are organizing to block new health 
delivery systems agreeing on minimum prices and allocating patients 
among themselves a justice department official said tuesday 
we are prepared to indict and fully to prosecute the 
professionals involved if the evidence warrants it assistant 
attorney general charles rule told a meeting of an american medical 
association group in dallas 
rule chief of the justice departments antitrust division said 
there are a few in the profession who it appears may have chosen 
to hold themselves above the law 
he added that naked agreements to fix prices allocate 
territories or to boycott competing healthcare providers are 
violations that can be prosecuted with penalties of up to three 
years in prison and 250000 fines for each violation copies of his 
speech were released at the justice department in washington 
rule declined to give any specifics about the grand jury probes 
but a justice department spokesman mark sheehan said three grand 
juries are empaneled investigating possible pricefixing by some 
allergists in boston some dentists in tucson ariz and some 
obstetricians in savannah ga 
it is rare for the government to prosecute organizations of 
medical professionals for criminal violations of the antitrust laws 
the ama was successfully prosecuted in the 1940s for attempting 
to eliminate an employeesponsored organization that sought to 
compete with feeforservice doctors rule noted 
rule declined to provide any details about the grand jury probes 
but in his speech text he said we have heard about doctors 
organizing to block new delivery systems by agreeing to withhold 
their services or to boycott doctors who do agree to provide their 
services 
he said this kind of behavior is not unlike that prosecuted 
nearly 50 years ago in the ama case 
rule also said there have been allegations that groups of 
independent doctors meet secretly to agree to a minimum price or to 
other terms that they will insist upon when they discuss 
participating in a group 
other allegations he said concern doctors agreeing to allocate 
patients among themselves on the basis of the patients residence or 
some other criteria

overcrowding at the salem jail as well as other elements of the

one thing had been bothering soviet 
interpreter inna novikova since the usussr emerging leaders 
summit began last week 
she had seen people sleeping on steam grates and living in 
cardboard boxes and wanted to know how a country with a reputation 
for wealth could allow its poor to live that way 
i think people soviet delegates will have a view of america 
that it is just perfect and only rich people live here ms 
novikova said as she stopped at the dignity shelter the hosting 
party is only showing us things in the best possible light 
i want to see the other side of america not just the best part 
of america i want to see how ordinary people live not everything 
is perfect in this country 
ms novikova and the 169 other soviet delegates have been staying 
in a leading hotel and received vip treatment at the armynavy 
football game saturday and from the cigna corp on sunday when the 
group visited the philadelphia insurance companys posh suburban 
conference center 
when mondays session broke early ms novikova persuaded us 
delegate arthur schwartz who operates the philadelphia youth 
leadership institute to take her to homeless shelters 
at women of hope a shelter for chronic mentally ill women and 
operated by sisters of mercy ms novikova asked a woman what being 
homeless meant 
i just left home because i got tired of the aggravation said 
deneen ferbee 30 who works as a mental health aide but who has 
been homeless for seven months i stayed in hotels and friends 
houses until money ran out 
as for the other women residents ms ferbee said the streets 
become their homes 
for ms novikova it was difficult to grasp why someone would 
choose to live on the street 
i cannot digest this said ms novikova 30 who lives with 
her parents because moscow apartments are at a premium 
when someone is living on the street ms ferbee said you 
dont know who to go to where to go if you go to a shelter you 
might not feel comfortable there all shelters are not clean 
the food is bad they dont want to live there there may be rats 
and roaches running around they say why live here when we can 
live on the streets 
do you understand 
maybe a little better replied ms novikova who peeked into 
bedroms closets and bathrooms of the neatly kept shelter 
theres not as much wealth in the soviet union but we dont 
have the tremendous poverty either she said 
staff member kathy murray said some homeless people including 
substance abusers and the mentally ill will not leave the streets 
ms novikova saw what ms murray was talking about at a subway exit 
where about 40 people were living in rows of cardboard boxes 
im starving hungry down here with nothing to eat said 
michael jordan 30 who said he has been homeless for four years 
how did it happen ms novikova asked 
im very upset and hungry and havent eaten in three four 
days jordan said you have any money 
thomas wiggins 30 and homeless interjected that youd be 
surprised how many viet vets live down here the government is 
obviously not doing their job 
ms novikova asked him why he didnt go to a shelter 
living in a shelter is like living in a penitentiary wiggins 
replied 
jordan remarked to ms novikova if you go back to russia ill 
go with you its got to be better than here 
replied wiggins no man this is the best country in the 
world

a bald eagle that died two days after it was 
discovered ill in the stillwater national wildlife area probably was 
poisoned by the increasingly toxic waters at the wetlands 
biologists said 
the birds carcass was shipped tuesday to the national wildlife 
health laboratory in wisconsin so scientists could confirm the cause 
of death 
if the 1yearold eagle did die monday from toxic poisoning it 
would be the first confirmed case at stillwater of a bald eagle 
dying from such a cause said biologist steve thompson 
about 18000 birds and 10 million fish have died at the 
164000acre wildlife refuge 90 miles east of reno during the past 
three years as drought evaporated the waters allowing toxins to 
build up and disease to spread 
thompson said scientists suspect the 9pound bald eagle died of 
toxins because of the birds behavior including wheezing and its 
low weight 
these could be signs of traceelement toxicity or avian 
disease thompson said right now we strongly suspect either 
lead or mercury poisoning 
preliminary data from a study of the newlands project a farming 
area that drains into stillwater shows high levels of selenium 
boron arsenic and mercury entering the wildlife refuge through 
irrigation ditches 
during the past two years the wetlands which serve as a 
stopover for migrating ducks geese and shorebirds on the pacific 
flyway have shrunk from 14000 acres to less than 4000 acres

foreign minister shimon peres responded tuesday 
to a plea from the president and again urged his labor party to 
renew coalition talks with the rival likud bloc 
prime minister yitzhak shamir meanwhile ran into more 
difficulties in his efforts to build a coalition led by his 
rightwing likud leaders of two religious parties claimed shamir 
had promised both the same cabinet post and the two rabbis held a 
shouting match on staterun israel radio 
peres new stand emerged after a breakfast meeting with israeli 
president chaim herzog a veteran laborite who pleaded monday for a 
likudlabor national unity government as he granted shamir a 21day 
extension to form a government 
herzog told peres such a government was the wish of the majority 
of israelis 
i was very impressed by what the president had to say peres 
said i told him i will propose to convene the partys central 
committee this week i will recommend to the committee to meet the 
request of the president 
labors 110member executive bureau the partys governing body 
last week voted in defiance of peres and labors no 2 defense 
minister yitzhak rabin and vetoed coalition talks with likud 
the 1300member central committee is empowered to overrule the 
bureaus decision and labor secretarygeneral uzi baram said the 
committee would meet thursday 
even though i feel we should not join a likud government under 
any circumstances if theres a demand to convene the commitee we 
will do so immediately said baram who led younger labor members 
in the vote against peres and rabin last week 
the issue of negotiations with likud has deeply divided the party 
and renewed a longstanding rivalry between peres and rabin 
shamir who has said he prefers a broadbased likudled cabinet 
also is working on composing a narrow government with farright 
parties and the four ultraorthodox parties that hold a decisive 18 
seats in the 120member parliament 
in the nov 1 elections likud won 40 seats to labors 39 with 
the remaining seats divided between 13 small factions 
shamirs efforts to weld together the religious parties ran into 
trouble tuesday as rabbi menachem porush of agudat israel and rabbi 
avraham ravitz of the torah flag said likud promised both control 
over the education ministrys ultraorthodox department 
a debate between the rabbis on israel radio quickly deteriorated 
into a shouting match with each interrupting the other 
despite the difficulties shamir was quoted as saying that likud 
would not seek new talks with labor until labor reversed its ban on 
contacts with likud 
there will be no chances for a broadbased government as long 
as the labor party doesnt change its decision of last week 
shamir told the maariv newspaper 
peres in turn criticized shamir for making too many concessions 
to potential coalition partners especially the orthodox parties 
that are pushing for farreaching religious legislation 
a broadbased government peres said must prevent legislation 
that will divide the jewish people 
he was referring to the socalled who is a jew law demanded 
by the religious parties such legislation would give orthodox 
rabbis sole authority over conversions to judaism 
the proposal has sparked anger among us jews most of whom 
belong to the more liberal reform and conservative branches of 
judaism and feel such that such legislation would delegitimize their 
beliefs 
dozens of american jewish leaders have come to israel in recent 
days to campaign against the proposed law 
in a meeting tuesday with representatives of the us council of 
jewish federations peres said the labor would not vote for the 
who is a jew law even if it joins a government 
the labor party would not change its position it will vote 
against the law as one man he said in remarks broadcast on israel 
army radio

a regulation to require antifume devices on 
gas tanks of new vehicles is unlikely to be issued before the bush 
administration takes office the environmental protection agency 
said tuesday 
our legal requirements are we have a public hearing give two 
weeks notice minimum and the record be open for 30 days after the 
hearing said dick wilson director of the epas office of mobile 
sources i think it is pretty hard to squeeze that in in the time 
remaining 
the schedule outlined by wilson conflicted with epa administrator 
lee thomas intent to complete the regulation in the waning days of 
the reagan administration 
thomas was determined to finish up this issue before he leaves 
office on jan 20 the last day of president reagans term martha 
casey an epa spokeswoman said tuesday 
the plan which the agency has been working on since 1987 has 
drawn criticism from auto manufacturers who argued the fume traps 
would increase the chance of fire in crashes 
the epa proposed the regulation after studies showed that 
gasoline fumes escaping while gas tanks were being filled could be 
dangerous to health 
the proposed regulation part of a broader package of 
fuelvolatility regulations is now under review by the white house 
office of management and budget 
once omb has completed its work the proposal will be returned to 
epa which will solicit public comment on the safety issue wilson 
said 
after the end of the 30day comment period the agency must study 
the record before deciding what form the regulation will take 
wilson said 
the agencys study is typically completed in a matter of 
weeks wilson said 
even if the proposal were returned to epa on wednesday and the 
postcomment study were completed in a week the regulation could be 
issued at the earliest in the first week of presidentelect george 
bushs administration under the schedule outlined by wilson 
i dont want to buy into the theory that were in a race 
against the clock wilson said we arent trying to cram a 
regulation out without taking all the due process to be sure 
what were doing makes sense 
oil companies have contended the fume traps should be installed 
in vehicles while automakers say they should be placed on gas pumps 
at service stations 
the automobilemounted trap includes a rubber tube that directs 
fumes into a charcoalfilled canister from which they eventually 
move into the engine for burning 
automakers have said the fume trap would add 80 to a cost of 
each vehicle the epa estimates the added cost at 20 per vehicle

musicians have voted to accept a new 
contract with the hartford symphony orchestra ending an 11week 
strike over wages and working conditions that forced the 
cancellation of 36 performances 
the new contract was approved late monday by a vote of 5122 
i think weve made major strides in several of the areas that 
were important to us said sarah oyer a violinist and member of 
the negotiating team for local 400 of the american federation of 
musicians 
but there were still some disappointments particularly in 
salaries for the core players who were hoping for a living wage 
that hasnt happened so there is not a sense of having won when 
the results of the vote were announced there was silence 
top salary under the new contract tentatively accepted by 
negotiators last week will increase from 17894 to 20500 by 1991 
im certainly pleased that the strike has been settled and the 
sounds of silence can be replaced by the sounds of the hartford 
symphony orchestra said morton handel president of the orchestra 
michael lankester the orchestras music director was 
particularly pleased 
the last note i conducted in the bushnell the orchestras 
home was the final dramatic chord of prokofievs ivan the 
terrible lankester said it thrills me to think that we can 
pick up where we left off and now perform the glorious music we have 
planned for the rest of the season 
it was the orchestras first strike since 1982 when the 
musicians staged a oneday walkout 
the musicians had agreed during the strike that they would 
perform for the hartford ballets annual performance of 
nutcracker scheduled to begin a 10day run on dec 15

their initial reaction is yech but by 
the time the annual rat olympics roll around psychology students at 
nebraska wesleyan university view their rodents with new respect and 
affection 
the rat olympics to be held saturday were established in 1975 to 
help psychology students get more out of their laboratory work in 
the departments learning and motivation class according to kenneth 
keith associate professor of psychology 
students train the white rats in six events the fiveyard dash 
fourfoot tightrope walk fiveyard hurdles fivefoot rope climb 
weightlifting and long jump 
diana stratbucker 20 a psychology major was a little leery of 
training a rat when the topic first emerged in class but now she 
thinks her rodent named gumby can break the olympic record of 
four feet in the long jump 
thats about the only event we have any hope in mine was 
jumping four feet today so hopefully well beat the record she 
said 
keith said the typical reaction from some students on the first 
day is yech 
a lot of them feel at first they couldnt possibly handle a 
rat but then when they get to work with them they find out they 
are mostly like kittens or puppies and they get kind of attached 
most of them end up keeping their rats as pets

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes visit 
to japan will bolster the nearly 5 billion bilateral trade and help 
resolve the dispute over islands claimed by both nations the soviet 
ambassador said tuesday 
shevardnadze the first highlevel soviet official to visit japan 
in nearly a decade is due in tokyo dec 1921 for meetings with 
foreign minister sousuke uno and prime minister noboru takeshita 
ambassador nikolai n soloviev said improved ties between the two 
countries were important to stability in the pacific region and that 
the diplomatic visit would be very important because 
japansoviet relations are at an important stage 
he said bilateral trade has grown to 498 billion in 1988 up 
from 49 billion last year and the potential for bilateral 
economic cooperation was great 
the talks were expected to touch on japanese investment in 
western siberia in november the soviet union signed a preliminary 
agreement with mitsubishi corp and other japanese companies to 
build a 83 billion chemical complex there 
soloviev said the two countries have concluded six joint 
ventures and 40 others were under negotiation 
a major obstacle to improved sovietjapanese ties is a 
territorial dispute over the tiny kuril islands off the northern 
japanese coast which are claimed by japan but have been occupied by 
the soviet union since 1945 soviet troops invaded the islands at 
the end of world war ii and later fortified them with 10000 troops 
soloviev told a private group in tokyo that both nations must 
respect each others claims to the islands 
in history sovietjapanese relations have been very 
complicated but we must now direct our line of vision to the 
future he said 
japanese diplomats have said they expect no substantial 
improvement in bilateral ties until moscow agrees to negotiate the 
return of the islands 
after tokyo shevardnadze will visit the philippines and north 
korea the kyodo news service said

president reagan told panamas deposed 
president eric arturo delvalle by telephone tuesday that the 
united states still supports a return to democracy in the central 
american republic the chief white house spokesman said 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan talked for about 10 
minutes with delvalle who was in miami visiting panamanian exiles 
there 
he said reagan told delvalle that the us policy in favor of 
freedom in panama remains steady 
we will continue to work with you and the panamanian people in 
favor of a realistic and durable solution fitzwater quoted reagan 
as saying 
he said the president told delvalle that we were very pleased 
to see the unity that you and your colleagues put together last 
month a reference to a meeting of panamanian opposition leaders 
who restated their desire for the ouster of military leader gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
fitzwater said the united states still believes that noriega 
shouessential to the restoration 
of democracy in panama 
asked why reagan chose to call delvalle at this particular time 
the spokesman said it was because the ousted panamanian president 
was easily accessible in miami delvalle had gone into hiding after 
he was deposed last feb 26 and replaced by manuel solis palma 
the united states has sought to undermine noriegas hold on power 
with an array of economic sanctions and with diplomatic pressure 
but there has been no indication that noriega who is charged with 
drug trafficking in federal indictments in florida has lost his 
grip on power

two florida pilots were among the first to 
be convicted in a federal crackdown on pilots who have failed to 
report drunken driving and drug convictions on their license 
applications 
thirtynine pilots have been indicted in florida colorado and 
utah and a probe of 7850 others is under way according to the 
federal aviation administration 
were bringing these cases because the us government finds it 
essential for air safety said assistant us attorney gary 
librick who prosecuted gary lee anderson in orlando 
anderson 34 was convicted monday of four counts of making false 
statements on medical forms to obtain his pilots licenses he faces 
up to 20 years in prison and 755000 in fines 
anderson failed to report a 1983 conviction for drunken driving 
and possession of marijuana and a 1987 conviction for reckless 
driving then lied to fbi agents who questioned him about the forms 
in september said the prosecutor 
also on monday william dixon gard 41 a private pilot from 
punta gorda was convicted in fort myers federal court on two counts 
of filing false statements said assistant us attorney doug 
fraser gard faces 10 years in prison and 500000 in fines 
a third case is scheduled in orlando this week 
defense attorneys criticized the felony charges 
the heavy hammer of a felony prosecution is entirely 
unwarranted said andersons lawyer former federal prosecutor tom 
turner prosecution based on this form is a crime itself turner 
told the federal jury in orlando 
the defense lawyer argued that the cases should be handled 
administratively by the faa 
anderson a flying instructor and freight pilot was fired from 
his job with flight express in orlando he was released on bail and 
sentencing was set for march 20 he did not testify and would not 
comment 
i think its a politically motivated witch hunt said 
assistant public defender ray dvorak about the federal crackdown 
it seems to me that they got their message across 
a computer audit has determined that 711000 people have licenses 
and permits from the federal aviation administration said faa 
spokesman ben lorigo in washington he said 10300 pilots had their 
drivers licenses suspended or revoked for drug and alcohol 
offenses and 7850 failed to report it 
its essential that the faa receive complete and truthful 
information by those who fly recreationally or privately as 
pilots said prosecutor librick

insurance industry officials told congress on 
tuesday that californias recently approved initiative slashing auto 
insurance rates was no mandate and would do nothing to control 
soaring premiums 
but consumer activist ralph nader and the author of californias 
proposition 103 testified to the same house panel that the measure 
is an important first step toward reining in high insurance costs 
nader found a sympathetic audience in rep james florio dnj 
chairman of the house commerce consumer protection and 
competitiveness subcommittee which has held four hearings on auto 
insurance in recent months 
people are justifiably angry over the rates they pay said 
florio saying insurance rates have increased 10 percent to 15 
percent over the last year well ahead of overall inflation and 
with equal justification they are losing confidence in a system that 
allows this to go on 
but william b snyder chairman of the geico corp one of the 
nations largest insurers said that proposition 103 was the wrong 
way to proceed 
the measure approved by california voters on nov 8 in a 
campaign in which the insurance industry reportedly spent 75 
million to defeat it has so far been blocked in the courts 
it would immediately reduce auto home and business premiums by 
20 percent it would also establish a longterm system requiring 
companies to increase their discounts for drivers with good safety 
records and forcing firms to open their books and justify any future 
rate increases 
fraud and chicanery are rampant snyder told the lawmakers in 
his prepared statement complaining that a large number of crooked 
lawyers medical doctors and chiropractors are available to any one 
who wants to subvert the insurance system 
the real answer to the problem is not the meaningless and 
senseless insurance bashing about which we have heard so much but 
true claim cost control he said 
john b crosby director of citizens for nofault an insurance 
industry group that waged an unsuccessful battle against proposition 
103 noted that the initiative had been approved by a margin of 
about 46 million to 44 million fifty of californias 58 counties 
voted against the measure 
there is no mandate in the vote for prop 103 said crosby 
who blamed auto theft fraud health care costs and increasing 
numbers of lawsuits for growing insurance costs 
nader however blamed the industrys waste inefficiency and 
inattention to loss prevention for the increasing premiums 
insurance customers will be standing up for their rights 
against unreasonable insurance rates arbitrary practices and 
lobbying pressure by insurance companies and their corporate allies 
to take away victims rights he said 
harvey rosenfield chair of voter revolt and author of 
proposition 103 accused the insurers of raw arrogance bluster 
and bullying tactics for trying to block the initiative and 
threatening to leave the state if it is implemented 
people want both immediate relief from years of high insurance 
rates and longterm fundamental reform of the insurance system 
he said

karl marx has been cleaned up and will be his old 
self again if president mikhail s gorbachev calls to pay his 
respects next week 
art students on tuesday finished chipping away with surgeons 
scalpels to remove the last traces of paint that some antimarxist 
four years ago oured over the massive bronze bust atop the grave in 
north london 
the students also regilded the famous exhortation workers of 
all lands unite from the 1848 communist manifesto inscribed 
on the plinth of cornish granite 
we are highly privileged to work on marx said karin hignett 
23 climbing down from a makeshift trestle scaffold in highgate 
cemetery a vast graveyard that opened in 1839 
but it was a bit monotonous she confided clasping her arms 
around herself in the damp and the cold 
plenty of people envy us a friend of mine would give his life 
to work on marxs tomb said simone boux 21 
it was black bitumastic paint and very difficult to remove we 
worked two days a week for four weeks to get it off said nick 
durnham the students tutor in stone conservation at the city and 
guilds of london art school 
there must have been a whole can of the paint poured over marx 
by someone who climbed up there he said the paint dribbled 
down and hardened we tried solvents and then found scraping with 
scalpels and washing with cold water was best 
marx was buried in 1883 and laurence bradshaws sculpture of his 
head was put up in 1956 
since then antimarxist slogans have been painted on the plinth 
the bust was attacked with hammers daubed with the british national 
colors of red white and blue and someone even tried to blow it up 
theres been an attempt to cut off the nose and it has four 
great cuts made by an ax or chisel but you cant see them unless 
you get up there he said 
jean pateman who runs a volunteer group caring for the cemetery 
said the cleanup had nothing to do with the scheduled visit of 
gorbachev 
its a coincidence but if mr gorbachev comes marx is 
ready she said 
i think mr gorbachev may very well come he didnt when he 
was here in 1984 durnham said 
we were working on other memorials when the cemetery manager 
asked us to take care of marx then the london communists who look 
after the marx grave asked us to do the regilding and make sure it 
was finished by the end of this week he said 
marx was born in 1818 in trier now in west germany and spent 
most of his life in exile for his political ideas and leadership of 
working mens organizations he settled in london in 1849 making a 
patchy living from journalism and relying on handouts from his 
friend and collaborator friedrich engels 
about 20 people turned up at marxs funeral to hear engels say 
the greatest living thinker has ceased to think 
marx lies between claudia jones from trinidad who died in 1964 
and a couple named griffiths john died 1952 and grace died 1976 
anyone can be buried here the humble and the eminent said 
mrs pateman 
weve just buried anna the last daughter of composer gustav 
mahler and actor sir ralph richardson is over there

after the crowds noise and confusion of the 
liberty weekend extravaganza two years ago residents of governors 
island consoled themselves with one thought nothing like it would 
happen again 
they were wrong in the words of coast guard lt cmdr paul 
milligan the two major individuals in the world are coming here 
to have lunch 
on tuesday the small island in new york harbor which is 
administered by the coast guard and used for a base was abustle 
with preparations for the arrival wednesday of mikhail gorbachev 
ronald reagan and george bush 
even though it sits in the nations busiest harbor and is just a 
brief ferry ride from manhattan governors island is a quiet town 
barred to the public except for one day in the spring and one in the 
fall when visitors are allowed to tour the speed limit on the 
islands roads 15 mph pretty much typifies the pace of life 
enjoyed by its 4000 residents all of them connected to the coast 
guard base 
the 173acre island was the epicenter of the fourday statue of 
liberty relighting celebration in 1986 some island residents who 
survived that experienced an unwanted sense of deja vu this week 
it took people a month to recover from the statue of liberty 
recalled henry apicos principal of the islands elementary school 
the island was turned into a carnival people felt imposed upon 
this time restrictions necessitated by the visit are going to 
create difficulties for some families he said 
on sunday night a fourpage notice was handed out to residents 
to inform them that for much of wednesday there would be no driving 
on the island and no ferry service hours at the coast guard mess 
hall were changed school was called off and the greg smith 
singers performance at st cornelius chapel was canceled 
residents of high security areas have been told to leave 
their homes or stay inside all afternoon they can look out the 
windows but may not open them peek from behind drawn shades or 
stand on their porches

the government said tuesday it hopes to end 
gasoline rationing april 1 and will end meat rationing as part of an 
experiment in one province at the start of 1989 
government spokesman jerzy urban made the announcements at a news 
conference in which he stressed the government is committed to 
reforming the economy 
the intention and the goal of the government is to lift all 
those forms of rationing urban said 
poles receive monthly gasoline ration cards based on the size of 
their automobiles that entitle them to buying a limited amount of 
fuel at the official price of about 91 cents per gallon 
ration coupons entitle motorists to 62 gallons of fuel a month 
for small cars and 94 gallons a month for big cars at the official 
price 
since june poles also have been permitted to buy gas at a 
commercial price of about 250 per gallon 
poles average monthly wage is about 112 
the spokesman said that while no final decision has been made 
the government would like to lift gas rationing april 1 
urban said the decision was more difficult in the area of meat 
rationing because it was not certain whether the government could 
assure adequate supplies of meat to the market if rationing was 
lifted he also said the concept of rationing remained popular among 
a majority of poles because it allows them to buy meat relatively 
cheaply 
most polish families are entitled to 5 pounds of meat per person 
per month at controlled official prices meat can also be purchased 
at private farmers markets for about four times as much 
ham costs about 180 a pound at official prices or as much as 
727 a pound in private markets 
as an experiment urban said one of polands 49 provinces would 
cease to use meat ration cards as of jan 1 this would allow 
authorities to gauge the effect of lifting the rationcard system 
he said urban did not specify the province where the experiment was 
to take place 
after six months he said only if it is possible will we 
propose to society to lift the coupons in such a way that it 
could gain social approval 
urban also said the government was formulating price increase 
plans for 1989 that envisioned the overall inflation rate at about 
50 percent inflation for 1988 has been estimated at more than 70 
percent

a law that stripped governors of control over 
training missions by their states national guard is 
unconstitutional an appeals court ruled today in the second 
challenge this year to the law 
both cases developed over guard trips to central america 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals ruling came in a lawsuit 
filed by minnesota gov rudy perpich challenging the montgomery 
amendment which was enacted in 1986 and effectively eliminated a 
requirement that governors give consent to training missions for 
their guard units prior to 1986 state units could not be sent on 
federal training missions without such consent 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals in october rejected a 
challenge to the amendment filed by massachusetts gov michael 
dukakis 
perpich claimed in the lawsuit that but for the montgomery 
amendment he would not have allowed his states national guard to 
conduct a training mission in central america the us department 
of defense had ordered minnesota guardsmen to active duty for that 
mission 
the majority of a threejudge panel of the appeals court in 
reversing the ruling of a federal district judge concluded that the 
montgomery amendment deprives the states of the authority of 
training the militia and violates article one of the constitution 
the majority said the constitution framers clearly intended the 
states to have control over part of the the nations military 
except in the case of an immediate threat as a check on the power 
of the federal government 
we understand that today the nations military forces often 
need to respond instantaneously that the federal government may 
need to use troops in a variety of situations short of decleared 
wars the majority wrote in the 80page opinion yet the world 
has not changed so dramatically that we can no longer abide by the 
provisions of our constitution and we are not convinced that the 
national defense will be harmed by our respecting reserved state 
authority over the national guard 
the montgomery amendment was passed after governors in some 
states began objecting to national guard training missions in 
central america until then governors had the veto power under the 
armed forces reserve act but did not use it according to minnesota 
chief deputy attorney general john tunheim 
minnesota first argued the case in july 1987 with support from 11 
other states before chief us district court judge donald d alsop 
the judge ruled in august that governors have no constitutional 
authority to withhold consent for national guard training missions 
in central america or elsewhere and thus upheld the amendment 
the number of states supporting the appeal dropped to five 
tunheim said they were massachusetts ohio colorado vermont and 
maine some of the support was lost because the national guard has 
threatened to withdraw federal funds from units in some states where 
governors oppose central american training missions tunheim said 
justice department lawyer deborah kant argued that governors have 
no authority under the constitution to redirect foreign policy by 
vetoing military training missions she said the montgomery 
amendment leaves intact gubernatorial veto power if guard units are 
needed at home 
they just cannot object for foreign policy reasons kant told 
the judges 
tunheim pointed out that foreign policy objectives of the us 
government are protected under the army clause of the constitution 
under that clause he said governors have no power over national 
guard units when the president or congress declares a national 
emergency or other special circumstances requiring national guard 
training or action 
in boston the 1st us circuit court of appeals on oct 25 
issued a onesentence order affirming a may 6 decision by us 
district judge robert keeton who upheld federal supremacy over the 
national guard 
in washington national guard bureau spokesman dan donohue said 
todays decision meant two federal court circuits were now at odds 
with each other suggesting further legal action was likely 
but no decisions have been made officially on an appeal the 
spokesman said were just now hearing about this 
according to the spokesman there are currently about 115000 men 
and women serving in the air national guard and another 460000 
serving in the army national guard 
the pentagon is planning to send about 6000 guard members from 
across the country to honduras during 1989 for roadbuilding and 
engineering exercises donohue said there are no such exercises 
under way at the moment because of the rainy season in central 
america he added 
us rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss whose name is 
carried on the amendment because of his role is creating it said he 
was disturbed by todays ruling 
if 50 governors are allowed to veto guard missions because they 
dont like the way our foreign policy is administered it would have 
an adverse impact on training and would raise questions about the 
availability of the guard to meet its considerable defense 
responsibilities montgomery said in a statement released from 
washington

deployment of thousands of police officers and 
traffic agents began tuesday to ensure the safety and smooth passage 
of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev during his threeday visit in the 
midst of the holiday crush 
it really is a maximum security operation said gillian 
martin sorensen the citys liaison to the united nations 
tremendous snarls already dubbed gorbylock were expected 
when traffic swollen with christmas shoppers is stopped on some of 
new yorks busiest streets so that gorbachevs 45car motorcade can 
wheel through the city 
sorensen said the police department which assigned 6600 
officers to the gorbachev detail was working closely with the 
secret service the state department and the united nations 
250member police force to coordinate protection for gorbachev 
on tuesday afternoon for gorbachevs arrival at kennedy 
international airport on long island and travel to the soviet 
mission in manhattan officials ordered closings of the van wyck 
expressway and the grand central parkway in queens the triborough 
bridge and fdr drive in manhattan to make sure theyre completely 
clear for the soviet motorcade 
its gridlock for peace so i guess we can bear with it said 
nelson castillo of the city department of transportation 
given the stature of the soviet leader weve got appropriate 
security which happens to be extraordinary in this case said 
port authority police lt frank talbert 
at least five protest groups will demonstrate outside the united 
nations during gorbachevs appearance before the general assembly 
and there is a history of antisoviet sentiment in the city 
including the 1984 firebombing of a car at the soviet residence in 
the bronx the 1986 teargassing of a moiseyev dance company 
performance and a 1987 bomb scare when the bolshoi ballet opened at 
lincoln center 
since gorbachev had no scheduled public appearances after his 
arrival tuesday law enforcement authorities focused more concern on 
wednesday which one police official called the day of infamy 
with extensive traffic disruption 
wednesdays itinerary released by the police department had 
gorbachev and his wife raisa visiting the observation deck atop 
one of the 110story world trade center towers in lower manhattan 
after the soviet leaders luncheon meeting with president reagan and 
vice president bush 
their 45car motorcade then is to pass the new york stock 
exchange and go through wall street and toward times square in mid 
manhattan all in the heart of rush hour 
among gorbachevs expected sightseeing stops thursday were the 
javits convention center on the west side of manhattan the 
metropolitan museum of art uptown on the east side and central park

united nations the soviet union which once scorned the united 
nations has embraced the world body under president mikhail s 
gorbachev as a prized foreign policy tool to promote his new 
political thinking and help extricate moscow from regional 
conflicts 
now the soviet union has become the mover and shaker the 
biggest booster of an international forum it once despised as 
ineffectual or westernbiased now more than ever the soviet union 
appears to be a team player the united states appears selfisolated 
gorbachev who plans to make his first address to the 159nation 
world body on wednesday is expected to deliver a dazzling tour de 
force on visionary foreign policy he is expected to cover issues 
ranging from the environment to conventional disarmament to the 
middle east and the need to promote the united nations as a 
oncediscarded multilateral forum whose time has come 
for several years the soviet union has been carrying out a 
public relations offensive at the united nations and has launched 
initiatives here as part of an international pattern of new soviet 
ideas on peacemaking on almost every continent 
gorbachevs visit comes at a time when the us relations with 
the world body strained during the entire reagan administration 
have soured abruptly over the us refusal to grant palestine 
liberation organization chairman yasser arafat a visa to speak here 
last week 
the united states also is more than half a billion dollars in 
arrears in its un budget and peacekeeping dues 
by contrast the soviet union has been repaying its back dues and 
now owes 159 million in regular budget and peacekeeping dues 
the soviet union has discovered the united nations which it 
either had ignored or had exploited as a polarized forum where it 
joined the third world in scoring points against the united states 
but today the eastwest climate had warmed dramatically and the 
soviet union is participating as never before in the united nations 
it is calling for the world body to play a larger role in 
peacekeeping resolving international conflicts in verification of 
disarmament and in fields from outer space to narcotics trafficking 
it has become among the least ideological least contentious 
members known more today for listening than for rhetoric 
the soviet union has viewed the unmediated agreement on 
afghanistan as a facesaving way to end its involvement in a costly 
conflict and withdraw its troops likewise the soviet union has 
encouraged un peacemaking efforts in cambodia where moscow has 
backed the vietnamese occupation it also sees a un plan for 
southern africa as a means to end the involvement of sovietbacked 
cuban troops in angola 
this year for the first time the united states and soviet union 
voted together on the afghanistan question expressing satisfaction 
with un efforts and soviet troop withdrawal 
while the united states tends to resolve its problems without the 
united nations the soviet union now tends to work within the un 
system 
now it is the soviet union more often than the united states 
which votes with the majority and is known for compromise seeking 
consensus floating ideas then going back to the drawing board and 
revising them for the soviet union all ideas appear to be open for 
discussion 
the soviet union now emphasizes its new thinking and a shift 
away from the old eastwest adversarial relationship it now talks 
of multipolarity an interdependent world security which depends on 
confidence not arms and disarmament to a level of 
selfsufficiency at which no one can successfully launch 
aggression 
the soviet union has been pushing for broader un peacekeeping 
powers including a un naval force in the persian gulf which would 
eliminate the need for a us naval presence in the iraniraq war 
it has called for meetings of the 15member security council at 
the foreign ministers level to discuss trouble spots around the 
world for several years it has been promoting a new comprehensive 
system of international security a vague concept covering 
everything from humanitarian issues to greater openness on military 
spending 
the united states opposes the concept as being undefined 
encroaching on national prerogatives and possibly giving the united 
nations too great a role 
last september soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
delivered an extraordinary even revolutionary un speech in which 
he said class struggle played no part in soviet foreign policy he 
devoted more discussion to the environment than to disarmament and 
extolled democracy and the rule of law in international affairs 
on wednesday gorbachev is expected to do no less and even go 
further 
president gorbachevs speech said one soviet official is 
likely to be a christmas present to the people of america and the 
world who want a safer world

mikhail s gorbachev facing turmoil at 
home could be in a hurry to make deals with the united states but 
presidentelect george bush with his administration just taking 
shape has every reason to tread slowly 
an army of kremlin spokesmen has descended on the united states 
hinting broadly that the soviet leader in his speech at the united 
nations on wednesday will make new proposals possibly on cuts in 
nuclear or conventional arms 
central committee aide nikolai shishkin told us television 
viewers that gorbachev would make a christmas gift to the american 
people and to mankind during his visit to the united nations 
the white house reacted coolly not wanting to repeat the 
freewheeling reykjavik summit 
we have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks who 
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to 
keep said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
and we have a new president who will be taking office in a few 
weeks who is not going to be making commitments when he doesnt 
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make 
these judgments said fitzwater who will continue as spokesman in 
the bush administration 
the american side is wary of repeating the detente experience 
entering into broad agreements with the kremlin only to see 
superpower relations plummet 
the americans forecast no agreements from the lunch wednesday 
among president reagan gorbachev and bush about the most that 
should be expected from the americans is a commitment for a formal 
summit early in the bush administration 
we are being very realistic fitzwater said we find 
nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about characterizing 
this meeting as a friendly discussion an open airing of issues 
between us and a healthy approach towards continuity 
tass the official soviet news agency expressed chagrin 
it is perfectly natural that the new administration will need 
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and 
international problems but it is very important not to drag out 
this period marking time in international affairs especially in 
the domain of arms limitation and reduction is tantamount not only 
to loss of time but to backsliding tass said in a statement 
distributed as gorbachev left moscow for new york 
gorbachevs own status is mixed he consolidated his control over 
the kremlin this fall assuming the post of president and lowering 
his two leading politburo critics a notch 
but his reform policies have not put more food on soviet tables 
or new clothes in soviet closets soviet officials acknowledged this 
year for the first time that their budget was running a deficit 
signaling that they have scarce funds for the capital improvements 
that may be needed to get the economy going again 
so gorbachev comes to the united states looking for agreements 
that could provide more western credits and technology 
at home gorbachevs policy of greater openness has brought many 
long suppressed problems to the surface 
the baltic republics of estonia lithuania and latvia are 
pressing for greater autonomy and racial antagonisms have forced 
the kremlin virtually to impose a state of martial law in the 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan in the south 
gorbachev to give himself breathing room at home and to 
compensate for the problems of perestroika or economic 
restructuring has been moving fast on the diplomatic front keeping 
at least a step ahead of the cautious americans 
in a dramatic first a soviet envoy negotiated on monday and 
sunday directly with afghan guerrillas western diplomats forecast 
that the soviets would allow the moslem guerrillas a role in a 
transitional government and the red army would meet its withdrawal 
deadline of feb 15 
gorbachev also was taking steps to improve relations with western 
europe and china further reducing tension on the soviet periphery 
bush insisted that he would participate in the luncheon only as 
vice president but he added i expect theyll be aware theyre 
talking to the next president 
he has been prudently assembling a foreign policy team of 
pragmatists 
on a personal level bush has been waiting for a long time for 
the top job cooling his heels for eight years in the white house 
wings under reagan he faces the unenviable task of shrinking the 
budget and trade deficits and the challenge of reasserting the 
leadership role for the united states in a changing world

when nikita khrushchev addressed the un 
general assembly in 1960 the soviet leader pounded a shoe on his 
desk and assured americans that we will bury you 
on tuesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev sent word of 
his intention to seek real political cooperation with the united 
states one day before his speech to the general assembly 
times have changed in 28 years soviet attitudes toward the west 
and the united nations are radically different with widespread talk 
of diplomacy and cooperation 
in 1960 khrushchev was enraged over secretarygeneral dag 
hammarskjolds action in sending un peacekeeping troops to the 
congo then a key soviet client state 
the general assembly of 1960 was the greatest circus in the 
history of the united nations said brian urquhart who then was 
undersecretarygeneral in charge of peacekeeping operations 
in those days world leaders often spent weeks attending the 
general assembly and sat with their delegations much of the time 
roaming the floor of the assembly were cubas fidel castro king 
hussein of jordan egypts gamal abdel nassar president dwight d 
eisenhower and khrushchev destined to be the star performer 
sometimes crude and profane and always easily angered 
khrushchev created the most memorable scene in un debate by 
pounding a shoe on the soviet delegations desk for a point of order 
philippine delegate lorenzo sumulong had just referred to the 
nations of eastern europe as being deprived of the free exercise 
of their civil and political rights and which have been swallowed 
up so to speak by the soviet union when khrushchev could stand 
no more 
the soviet leader slipped off his right shoe and waved it 
menacingly at sumulong the debate continued the soviet leader 
began pounding the shoe on the delegations desk shocking the 
assembly and shouting point of order 
continuing khrushchev called sumulong a toady of american 
imperialism 
khrushchev bellowing in russian said the congo was struggling 
to throw off imperialism and then told general assembly president 
frederick boland that we live on earth not by the grace of god 
nor sir by your grace but by the strength and intelligence of the 
great people of the soviet union and of all the peoples which are 
fighting for their independence 
khrushchev got so abusive that the irish president of the 
assembly freddie boland broke the gavel in calling him to order 
and the head of the gavel flew off into the general assembly said 
urquhart 
the most famous shoe in political history remained perched on the 
desk of the soviet delegation 
a un visit by a soviet leader is a rarity the foreign minister 
usually delivers the annual address to the general assembly 
between khrushchev and gorbachev the only other topranking 
soviet visitor was premier alexei kosygin the chief administrator 
of the government who came to the united nations in 1967 to support 
arab complaints against israel

the 360yearold royal warship wasa 
moved to its final berth tuesday with hundreds of people gathering 
in gray and snowy weather to cheer its last voyage 
designed as the mightiest ship of its day the wasa sank on its 
maiden voyage in 1628 it was salvaged from stockholm bay in 1961 
and displayed in a temporary museum winning acclaim as one of the 
best preserved ships of its kind 
it was placed on a pontoon and encased in an aluminum shield to 
protect it during the 275yard voyage to the site of a new museum 
under construction 
a 24pound cannon retrieved from the wasa roared the announcement 
of the ships arrival at its final port of call 
i have dreamt of this moment and gone through it so many times 
in my mind that it feels like a deja vu experience said anders 
franzen who rediscovered the ship and supervised its salvage 
the new museum which will open in june 1990 is a huge 28 
million coppercolored enclosure facing the royal palace on the 
stockholm waterfront 
the move ends years of discussions on the fate of the ship which 
was to be the flagship of a swedish empire stretching from the 
scandinavian peninsula across the baltic and into russia 
topheavy with armaments the wasa caught a mighty gust of wind 
and capsized only minutes after being launched 
crowds lined the shore to see if it would topple once more 
it has been a constant nightmare that history will repeat 
itself said franzen a retired scientist 
transporting the ship into the new dock became a test of 
precision for the tug towing the 22yardhigh encasement he said 
the wasa adorned with most of its original 700 goldleaf 
sculptures has become a symbol of ancient sweden at the height of 
its power it attracts 500000 tourists a year

a lawyer for the boy scouts of america said 
tuesday that psychological problems plaguing a boy who was sexually 
molested by his scoutmaster stem from his unstable family life 
the family of the youth who is now 17 is suing the scouts and 
former scoutmaster carlton l bittenbender saying the boy suffers 
from a stress disorder because of bittenbenders assaults and that 
the scouts system for detecting child abusers is inadequate and 
ineffective 
but attorney robert e cadigan told a fairfax county va 
circuit court jury in his opening arguments that the teen whose 
name is not being publicly revealed required psychiatric treatment 
as early as the third grade long before he met bittenbender at age 
12 
the fact is this youth had many problems even before 
bittenbender came on the scene said cadigan 
the boy willingly submitted to a sexual relationship with his 
scoutmaster for 10 or 11 months cadigan told the jury of three men 
and six women evidence will show that at no time when this 
relationship was going on did the youth have emotional problems 
instead cadigan charged the boy had to go to a psychiatric 
hospital two months after the relationship with bittenbender ended 
in dec 1985 because he was acting out his anger over longterm 
family problems 
when bittenbenders name was brought up during the youths 
hospitalization said cadigan it caused no adverse emotional 
response from the boy on the contrary he idolized bittenbender 
it was his parents visits that caused an adverse emotional 
response he said 
the youths mother had a sexual relationship with bittenbender 
for about four months during the period when the scoutmaster was 
molesting the boy cadigan said 
the boys father was a homosexual had a drinking problem and 
moved out of the familys home late last year cadigan said he also 
said a psychologist had diagnosed the father as being a possible 
manic depressive 
the familys attorney william a barton said monday that 
bittenbender was able to evade detection because the organization 
fearing negative publicity was reluctant to publicize abuse cases 
and identify abusers he also said there were no internal safeguards 
against potential child molesters within the scouts 
on monday barton had also discussed the problems troubling the 
boys parents 
barry bach another attorney for the scouts said the 
organization kept confidential files to screen out people who were 
unfit to lead scout troops 
bittenbender is serving a 30year prison term for his 1985 
conviction for sodomy and aggravated sexual battery against three 
boys under the age of 13 including the youth represented in the 
lawsuit he had had a prior history of molesting boys that resulted 
in dismissals from new england public schools and convictions on 
four counts of seconddegree sexual assault as scoutmaster of a 
rhode island troop in 1981 
the boys family is seeking about 100000 for his health care 
costs plus punitive damages

newspaper were indicted by a state grand jury tuesday on 14 counts 
of seconddegree kidnapping

eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs after the indictments were 
returned hobgood set bond for the two men at 140000 each 
hatcher 31 and jacobs 20 were acquitted by a federal jury

stemmed from the feb 1 takeover of the robesonian newspaper in 
lumberton in which up to 20 people were held hostage 
hatcher and jacobs never denied taking over the newspaper but 
said they were trying to save their lives by drawing attention to 
hatchers claims that he had information linking public officials to 
drug trafficking 
state bureau of investigation agent james bowman said he expected 
more indictments to come later against alleged coconspirators and 
others suspected of obstruction of justice he would not elaborate 
the indictments named only 14 hostages as prosecution witnesses 
in the case bowman said investigators believed some of the hostages 
did not wish to prosecute the men 
the six hostages not listed in the indictments included 
robesonian editor bob horne and newspaper employees ricky mckinnon 
and raymond godfrey as well as three hostages who were not 
newspaper employees 
the maximum sentence for seconddegree kidnapping is 30 years on 
each count the presumptive sentence the sentence normally given 
is nine years

a state governor on tuesday joined a 
dispute between some roman catholics and the vatican over the naming 
of colognes new archbishop 
northrhine westfalia gov johannes rau said there would be 
farreaching consequences for statevatican relations if the 
vatican does not work with the state to resolve the dispute he did 
not elaborate 
the position has been vacant since cardinal joseph hoeffner died 
in october 1987 
colognes archbishop is potentially the most influential church 
post in the nation he traditionally has headed the west german 
bishops conference 
the archdiocese is made up of the states of northrhine westfalia 
and the rhinelandpalatinate 
rau a lutheran said any attempt by the vatican to resolve the 
problem by making the appointment itself would violate a 1929 
agreement giving the states veto power over the appointment

a former finance officer for lyndon h 
larouche jr testified tuesday that he resigned in mid1986 after 
realizing that millions of dollars in loans to the political 
eccentrics organization werent going to be repaid but he said he 
was unaware of any policy to refuse to honor the debts 
wayne hintz told jurors in larouches mail and tax fraud 
conspiracy trial in us district court that he got no response to a 
series of memos to his superiors including larouche warning of 
an alarming growth in loan debts 
hintz also was disturbed he said when regional fundraisers in 
late 1985 began seeking forgiveness of loans 
it was not an easy thing to do he said it had not been 
attempted until recently as a systematic approach to reducing 
indebtedness 
hintz said he finally quit in june 1986 when his time devoted to 
managing the loan debt was reduced and he was forced to take on new 
fundraising efforts hintz said 
it became clear to you that the loans werent going to be 
repaid asked defense attorney michael reilly 
yes hintz replied 
you felt that in good conscience you couldnt continue to be 
part of that process 
yes 
but later under questioning by other defense attorneys hintz 
said he did not know of any official policy to deliberately refuse 
to pay off the loans as promised except for short periods of time 
when cash revenues were running low 
there was no policy i was aware of not to repay the loans 
hintz said 
hintz testified as government prosecutors neared the completion 
of their case against larouche a perennial minorparty presidential 
candidate in the third week of the trial 
larouche and six associates are charged with mail fraud and 
conspiracy for allegedly raising more than 30 million in loans from 
supporters with no intention of repaying them 
in addition larouche is charged with conspiring to defraud the 
internal revenue service by having all his personal expenses paid 
from funds of various corporations he controls the government says 
larouche has filed no federal income tax returns since 1978 
if convicted of all 13 counts against him larouche faces a 
maximum penalty of 65 years in prison and fines totaling 325 
million he has denied any wrongdoing 
hintz said that at one point in late 1985 loans accounted for 
more than half the larouche organizations weekly income of 600000 
and the percentage was growing at a rate that alarmed him 
he said his superiors offered to allocate 80000 a week to make 
payments on some loans primarily involving hardship cases or those 
that were targets of litigation he said his bosses also agreed to 
impose a ceiling on new loans 
but he said these measures werent nearly enough to help us get 
out of the woods by the time he resigned hintz said i did not 
know how it would be possible to reduce the indebtedness 
i had run out of ideas an image of how this might be done 
he said

president reagan will hold a prime time news 
conference thursday likely the last such formal questionandanswer 
exchange before he leaves office jan 20 
be nice its his last one first lady nancy reagan told 
reporters tuesday after she accepted the official white house 
christmas tree 
chief presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater asked whether it 
would be reagans last news conference said well this is the 
december press conference and you just never know after that 
the session to be held in the east room of the white house will 
be reagans fifth formal news conference this year and 46th of his 
nearly 8yearold presidency 
two of reagans previous four news conferences this year were 
held out of the country one at the conclusion of his summit with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow on june 1 and 
another just 20 days later at the end of the sevennation economic 
summit in toronto 
the session will come a day after reagans meeting in new york 
with gorbachev besides discussing eastwest relations reagan 
likely will be asked to state his views on the pending trial of 
former aide oliver l north a key defendant in the irancontra 
case he also will surely be asked about his personal feelings as 
his twoterm administration draws to a close 
by historical standards reagan has held relatively few formal 
questionandanswer sessions with news reporters and this was 
criticized recently by a harvard commission of scholars and 
journalists 
reacting to that report in midoctober fitzwater suggested that 
the institution of the presidential press conference is overrated as 
a means of communicating with the people fitzwater said no chief 
executive should be expected to fulfill a quota on such 
questionandanswer sessions 
the harvard report said white house news conferences have fallen 
into a serious state of disarray under reagan 
fitzwater recently was named by presidentelect george bush to be 
press secretary in the bush white house the presidential spokesman 
said he would not guess how frequently bush would hold news 
conferences

presidentelect george bush today named texas 
oilman robert mosbacher as secretary of commerce and tapped carla 
hills the first woman picked for a highlevel post in the incoming 
administration to be special trade representative 
bush also named michael boskin a stanford university professor 
of economics and a campaign adviser to head his council of economic 
advisers 
turning to foreign policy bush also said cia director william 
webster would remain in his post the latest in a string of holdover 
appointments from the reagan administration 
the presidentelect completed an assortment of appointments by 
naming thomas pickering the former ambassador to israel nigeria 
el salvador and jordan as his ambassador to the united nations 
bush is not expected to make additional nominations until after 
his meeting in new york on wednesday with president reagan and 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
careful to avoid impinging on president reagans final weeks in 
power bush said he would attend the superpower s years than he 
would like to admit more than three decades the texas oilman was 
a key fundraiser in bushs winning presidential campaign 
fielding questions after making his announcements bush said 
neither pickering nor webster would hold cabinet rank 
he said both men would be invited to cabinet meetings as needed 
but said there was no point in having the united nations ambassador 
sitting in for cabinet discussions of agriculture policy something 
bush recalled doing while serving at the un in the 1970s 
he said webster would stay in his post for an openended 
period there has been frequent speculation that he would stay in 
his job for only a few months 
in tapping boskin bush named a man who helped design the 
flexible freeze that serves as the cornerstone of his 
deficitcutting proposals boskin also was involved in bushs 
campaign proposal to cut the capital gains tax 
mosbacher and ms hills will oversee the nations trade policy 
the office of us trade representative negotiates trade agreements 
and the secretary of commerce enforces them and seeks to expand 
markets for us goods 
mosbacher will take over commerce from former steel executive c 
william verity who has held the job for only a year reagan 
appointed verity after the death of commerce secretary malcolm 
baldrige in a horseback riding accident 
the sources said mosbacher had been promised the job several 
weeks ago but that the fbi background check on him had taken longer 
than expected because of his vast financial holdings 
ms hills will succeed us trade representative clayton yeutter 
to a job that has become more sensitive as the national trade 
deficit has risen to record levels it was 170 billion last year 
and is running at an annual rate of 137 billion this year 
bush transition sources said that the vice president would not 
name a secretary of defense before he and reagan meet on wednesday 
in new york with gorbachev the sources said tower remains the 
favorite for the post 
new hampshire gov john sununu who will be bushs chief of 
staff said today in concord nh that the defense departments 
top echelon may be named in a batch of as many as five appointments 
the naming of a new secretary of defense and his subordinates 
is being measured in two handfuls he said 
earlier today bush told cabinet veteran elizabeth dole that he 
would like her to participate in the new administration but no job 
commitments were made an aide said 
mrs dole a former transportation secretary and bush spent 
about 45 minutes together over breakfast according steve hart 
bushs spokesman 
the vice president ate lunch with rep dan rostenkowski dill 
chairman of the house ways and means committee earlier today 
rostenkowski suggested raising the 91centsagallon federal 
gasoline tax as a way of boosting government revenue and easing the 
deficit 
asked about taxes rostenkowski said i dont know it will be 
a decision the presidentelect is going to have to make but im in 
the tax business 
i used to be in that business when i served under him on ways 
and means interjected bush a former congressman from texas bush 
called their talks confidential but said both he and rostenkowski 
want to move this country forward 
meantime a spokeswoman for rep jack kemp rny said he had 
not met with bush transition people about the possibility of 
becoming the secretary of housing and urban development 
he is planning to go into the private sector mary burnette 
said 
kemp whose own presidential ambitions fell by the wayside early 
in the 1988 primary season has long been rumored as a strong 
candidate for the hud job

the us postal service lost 597 million in 
the 1988 fiscal year but expects to finish the new year about the 
same amount to the good officials said tuesday 
final figures for fiscal 1988 which ended in october were 
reported at the monthly meeting of the agencys board of governors 
and released at headquarters here 
the loss of 597 million included payments of 510 million to the 
federal treasury the postal service has not received a government 
subsidy since 1982 
the postal rate increase that took effect april 4 is expected to 
move the agency into the black in the current fiscal year with 
projections calling for it to finish between 550 million and 600 
million to the good 
overall the postal service has been in the black five times in 
the last 10 years 
when it was made an independent federal agency in the early 
1970s the post office was directed to break even over the long term 
and its subsidy was phased out over time 
breaking even has required periodic rate increases currently 
scheduled about every three years the next rate hike is expected to 
be filed in 1990 to take effect in 1991

famine will ravage southern sudan again 
next year even if the civil war ends and emergency food airlifts 
now under way will do nothing to stave it off un relief officials 
said tuesday 
most survivors of this years famine which claimed hundreds of 
thousands of victims are too weak to till the fields they abandoned 
because of the fighting the officials said 
the town of aweil typifies the desperation facing this african 
country one of the worlds poorest which spends 1 million a day 
trying to crush a 5yearold rebellion in the christian and animist 
south against the moslem north 
a un official who visited aweil last week called it a town of 
graves 
aweil 580 miles southwest of khartoum is among the targets of 
an airlift that began sunday to deliver sorghum oil and medicines 
relief planes land at wau 45 miles southwest of aweil and 
capital of the bahr elghazal region organizers for the 
international committee of the red cross hope to ship supplies from 
wau to aweil and other towns 
the relief effort which also includes flights from the kenyan 
border town of lokichokio to rebelheld areas is the first to 
operate under pledges from both sides to give the planes safe 
passage 
another airlift organized by un organizations and the sudanese 
government relief is sending relief planes to aweil and nearby 
elobeid organizers of both say they will continue as long as 
security permits 
western diplomats said a de facto ceasefire has existed since 
rebels led by former col john garang and the democratic unionist 
party a junior partner in sudans governing coalition signed an 
interim peace agreement last month 
relief workers said many of the hundreds of thousands who fled to 
aweil and other towns during the rainy season when garang and his 
sudan peoples liberation army take the offensive returned home 
after the rains ended in october 
but now only half are physically capable of cultivating the 
land a un official said on condition of anonymity that 
means only half the amount of food needed will be available they 
will eat it and then come to the towns and when the rainy season 
starts next june another tragedy will happen 
an average of 62 people died each day in wau at the peak of 
famine and about 8000 are believed to have died in aweil 
thousands more perished in muglad abyei and other towns in the 
strip that divides sudans north and south 
detlef palm of unicef said the tragedy is over for the moment 
we made a quick survey we asked families how many children they had 
lost and they would usually point to little mounds or graves near 
their huts and say one or two or three or all of them died 
palm one of the group visiting aweil last week said a measles 
epidemic in june killed many children and half those remaining 
suffer from malnutrition in varying degrees 
we can only fly one ton on each flight he said aweil 
desperately needs bulk food and that can only go by train 
he and other un oficials said a 30car train with 900 tons of 
food was being delayed in babanousa 125 miles from aweil because 
of the danger 
they said the short trip would take four weeks because the tracks 
were in poor condition and constant checks had to be made for 
ambushes or mines the last train reached aweil in march three 
months before the rains 
predictions for 1989 are gloomy one un official said no 
matter when the peace agreement will be signed we anticipate the 
same disaster next year 
its a cycle that has happened for hundreds of years but 
before the war people stockpiled the food in the villages now the 
situation is aggravated by the displaced people and the war makes 
transport of food more difficult 
palm said aweil with 30000 local residents and 60000 refugees 
expekcted next spring needs 11000 tons of food to last through the 
rainy season but it will be impossible to deliver 
another un official said aweil will need up to 28000 tons more 
than it gets next year and the situation in the rest of the south 
must be equally as bad even if peace is restored it wont feed the 
people 
the south will remain an area with a high food deficit for 
years he said peace might only make the transportation of food 
easier

people should not take comfort in this years 
apparently improved ozone levels over antarctica a climate expert 
warned tuesday 
this year there is a substantial recovery in antarctic ozone 
levels dr robert watson of the national aeronautics and space 
administration told the opening session of the second north american 
conference on preparing for climate change 
but despite the improvement there is no reason to believe the 
manmade chemicals are not destroying ozone in the atmosphere he 
said damage to that layer could increase again next year or the 
year after said watson 
ozone high in the atmosphere blocks some of the suns ultraviolet 
radiation and scientists fear that a reduction in that protective 
screen could lead to more skin cancer eye damage and other problems 
depleted ozone levels over antarctica have been widely referred 
to as a hole in the earths ozone layer and some concern has 
also been expressed over whether the problem has spread to the 
arctic 
changes in clouds temperature winds and other weather factors 
could account for the improvement this year but that doesnt mean 
there will be a permanent improvement said watson who is preparing 
for a research effort to investigate ozone levels at the north pole 
ozone levels over the antarctic in september and october were 
about 22 percent below that measured in 1979 watson said by 
contrast last year the level was 50 percent of the 1979 level 
such low ozone levels will not spread around the globe watson 
said but populated areas could see a slight decline in the ozone 
overhead and that would mean health dangers 
governments are likely to further restrict release of chemicals 
that damage the ozone however thus easing the longterm damage he 
said 
the question is not whether there will be an international 
agreement to extend the limits reached previously at montreal only 
when a new agreement will be made said watson 
the ozone hole was first reported in the early 1980s by british 
researchers it occurs within a vortex of west to east winds which 
circle the south pole in the winter and spring months equivalent 
to the summer and fall months in the northern hemisphere 
watson noted that this year the area of reduced ozone while 
smaller than in the last couple of seasons has shifted somewhat 
instead of being near the south pole the area has moved toward 
south america he commented with the region of antarctica closer to 
australia having near normal ozone levels 
of particular importance may be the reduction in the amount of 
high level clouds in the polar regions watson said those clouds 
provide ice surfaces which promote the chemical reactions in which 
chlorine and bromine compounds damage or destroy molecules of ozone 
scientists report

a public outcry grew over a 
justdisclosed nuclear accident that occurred a year ago in west 
germany and officials acknowledged tuesday that human errors were 
involved 
hesse environment minister karlheinz weimar alleged a utility 
company initially gave authorities a visibly wrong description of 
the facts of the accident a charge the semiprivate 
rhinewestfalia electrical company denies nobody was hurt when a 
small amount of radioactive steam was released into the atmosphere 
dec 1617 1987 at the biblis reactor 
but environmentalists charge technical and human errors could 
have caused a serious nuclear accident at the plant located in the 
heavily populated rhine river valley about 30 miles south of 
frankfurt 
weimar conceded he was mistaken to withhold details from the 
public 
in hindsight it is completely clear that it would have been 
better if i had decided differently he told reporters 
he also alleged without elaboration that the utility company 
initially resisted evaluations of the incident by authorities 
but the company insists it reported the incident in line with 
federal and state regulations 
hesse state and federal officials have said they initially 
believed the accident was less serious but also insist there never 
was any danger independent atomic energy observers agree 
the accident was revealed by inside nrc an american biweekly 
industry newsletter about nuclear safety 
it is scandalous that the populace learns of this only a year 
later through an american newsletter said ernst welteke head of 
the social democratic party in hesse 
west germans have been sensitive about nuclear energy since the 
1986 chernobyl disaster released radioactivity in much of central 
europe 
social democrats have demanded officials close the 1200megawatt 
reactor at biblis and environmentalists have increased calls for the 
country to abandon nuclear power 
nuclear plants provide 35 percent of west germanys power 
a spokesman for darmstadts oekoinstitute environmental research 
organization drew parallels with human errors at the 1979 three mile 
island accident in middletown pa 
for 15 hours they biblis operators didnt recognize an alarm 
in the control room signalling that the position of a valve was not 
correct the same kind of thing happened at three mile island 
said lothar hahn 
atomic energy officials say plant operators either did not notice 
the light for 15 hours or did not believe there was a malfunction 
they also say reactor operators were wrong wrong to open a second 
valve for a few seconds to try to close the malfunctioning one 
the newsletter said opening the second valve allowed a small 
amount of radioactive steam to escape into the atmosphere 
horst may a spokesman for the reactor safety institute said 
with the extra pressure on the second valve there would have been 
danger that the pipes could break which might have meant a loss of 
coolant but he added the reactor has several emergency backup 
systems to prevent this 
environment minister klaus toepfer said as a result of the biblis 
incident nuclear reactors across the country have been outfitted 
with equipment to avoid such accidents and work crews have received 
new training

ocean spray cranberries inc will plead guilty to 
federal charges that it intentionally dumped hazardous waste into 
sewers near its fruitprocessing plant in an eastern massachusetts 
town authorities said tuesday 
ocean spray which pleaded innocent to the charges in february 
has asked for a change of plea hearing dec 20 before us district 
judge david nelson 
assistant us attorney richard e welch 3rd said tuesday the 
only possible plea change is to guilty and there will be pleas of 
guilty to negligent and willful charges 
the cranberry cooperative declined comment on the settlement 
ocean spray could be fined 21 million if convicted of the six 
felony and 72 misdemeanor charges that allege it discharged 
cranberry peelings and acids into municipal sewers and the nemasket 
river from 1983 to 1987 despite being fined by middleboro a town 35 
miles south of boston 
the case was the first in which the government charged a company 
with a felony under the clean water act 
despite the plea change the possibility remains that some of the 
charges could be dropped including the felonies federal 
prosecutors said 
ocean spray spokesman john m lawlor said the company would have 
no further comment on the case until it is settled 
we are working on a solution that is in the best interests of 
our company our growerowners and the middleboro community ocean 
spray president and chief executive officer john s llewellyn jr 
said in a statement monday 
the negotiations are still in progress so its premature to 
disclose any specifics now he said 
middleboro town manager john healey said town officials have been 
working with ocean spray since the indictment was issued jan 28 
ocean spray a 781 million cooperative employs 400 people full 
time and up to 575 people part time in the town of 20000 
on the day it was indicted ocean spray said it never endangered 
the publics health or the environment 
us environmental protection agency officials had described the 
indictment as a test case of the clean water act 
it took them about six months to come to the conclusion that 
they had done something in fact that was a violation of the clean 
water act and they had to do something to correct that healey 
said 
the indictment charged that ocean spray almost daily since 1976 
dumped up to 200000 gallons of poorly treated excessively acidic 
waste water into the nemasket river and middleboros sewer system 
ocean spray said monday it has spent 32 million since 1986 to 
improve and clean up its operations in middleboro

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi showed kindness to several hostages during the ordeal a 
flight attendant from the jetliner testified tuesday 
flight attendant helen sheehan also said some crew members gave 
misleading accounts of the hijacking to the news media after their 
release 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem was charged with murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 hijacking thirtynine americans were held 
hostage for 17 days and us navy diver robert stethem was killed 
during the ordeal 
hamadi has admitted he and an accomplice hijacked the 
athenstorome flight but has denied killing stethem of waldorf 
md 
mrs sheehan said the crew of the hijacked airliner met in 
september 1985 to discuss the hijacking and agreed that hamadis 
accomplice was the leader of the operation and that he not hamadi 
might have shot stethem 
hamadis accomplice identified in court documents as hassan 
ezzeddine is a fugitive witnesses at the trial have testified that 
he used the name said during the hijacking 
the consensus of opinion at the time was that it was said who 
was in charge about the aircraft and while we discussed that nobody 
saw who murdered mr stethem we did feel that said might have been 
the one who could have done it mrs sheehan said referring to 
the meeting of the crew at twa headquarters in new york 
pilot john testrake testified earlier that he believed hamadi 
pulled the trigger and copilot philip maresca testified he saw 
hamadi with a gun seconds after stethem was shot 
mrs sheehan 45 said hamadi was carrying a gun before stethems 
murder but that after she heard a shot she saw said with a pistol 
she also said hamadi sometimes acted with kindness to the 
hostages 
mr hamadi personally gave a glass of water to clinton suggs 
a us navy diver said mrs sheehan who has us and british 
citizenship and still works for the airline 
mr hamadi also personally served a meal to kurt carlson 
said mrs sheehan carlson was one of the americans severely beaten 
by the hijackers mrs sheehan said she was aware of the beatings 
but did not witness them 
when i saw mr stethem for the first time it was apparent to me 
that he had internal injuries because he had trouble breathing and 
had difficulty walking she said 
mrs sheehan said she disagreed strongly with statements made by 
other crew members after their release 
there were so many different reports that i thought i myself 
was at a different hijacking she told the court without giving 
any specifics 
she criticized a us television movie based on the hijacking 
saying mr hamadi was clearly shown as being the killer of mr 
stethem in my estimation that was putting someone on trial without 
giving them due process 
mrs sheehan also criticized twa management and fbi agents for 
the way they handled events immediately after the hostages were 
released 
we were returned to new york and we walked into a circus 
atmosphere she said 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport in 1987 after customs 
officials found liquid explosives in his luggage

us and soviet officials today offered 
different previews of wednesdays meeting between the superpowers 
leaders with the americans trying to dampen expectations raised by 
the soviet promise of a christmas gift to the american people and 
mankind 
we have a president who is leaving office in a few weeks who 
is not going to be making any promises that he is not here to 
keep said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
and we have a new president who will be taking office in a few 
weeks who is not going to be making commitments when he doesnt 
have an administration in power that can fully analyze and make 
these judgments he said 
fitzwater commented as both sides prepared for the meeting of 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday in new york city 
the session will be held after gorbachev addresses the un 
general assembly secretary of state george p shultz and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will meet in the morning at 
the us mission to the united nations 
gorbachev arriving in new york today from moscow did not 
discuss any specifics but said there was no agenda for his meeting 
with reagan and bush 
i believe that we can safely say even now that the 
conversations and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater 
dynamism in the dialogue and relations between our two countries 
gorbachev said 
but he is expected to make wideranging proposals to the general 
assembly and possibly in his meeting with reagan and bush 
a top soviet communist party official nikolai shishlin said 
sunday that gorbachev would have a christmas gift to the american 
people and to mankind on his visit to new york 
an american official today acknowledged the possibility of a 
grand gesture such as a reduction of soviet troops in 
czechoslovakia and hungary it is plausible they would do it on 
the eve of the opening of negotiations with the west and also as a 
public relations move said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
such a move in the absence of a similar move by the united 
states would reduce the soviet advantage in conventional forces in 
europe and could facilitate an overall conventional force agreement 
early in the bush administration 
the us official told the associated press that the soviets gave 
no formal notification in advance of gorbachevs visit of a troop 
reduction however the official said it is certainly on our 
list of expectations 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact are 
expected to open talks on reducing troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear forces early next year 
the reagan administration however continued to play down the 
event 
fitzwater said that while gorbachev could spring a surprise it 
would not be embarrassing if the meeting concluded without a 
breakthrough or an agreement 
fitzwater also suggested that us officials would not let 
gorbachev put them under pressure to respond immediately to some new 
initiative 
we are being very realistic fitzwater said we find 
nothing embarrassing or in any way negative about characterizing 
this meeting as a friendly discussion an open airing of issues 
between us and a healthy approach towards continuity 
he said that simply by meeting the us and soviet officials 
illustrate the strength of the new relationship between 
washington and moscow 
bush meanwhile insisted that he would participate in the 
luncheon only as vice president but he added i expect theyll 
be aware theyre talking to the next president 
echoing that line senate minority leader bob dole rkan said 
reagan is going to be in charge until the 20th of january george 
bush understands that gorbachev understands that but gorbachev 
also knows thats not very far away 
under diplomatic protocol though bush will be at the meeting as 
reagans understudy not as presidentelect colin powell the white 
house national security adviser said that given bushs position 
it would not be appropriate then for the vice president to have 
a separate agenda 
asked about the soviet report likening gorbachevs planned 
proposals to a christmas present bush joked were not going to 
open it before christmas 
more seriously he said well consider whatever it is he has 
to say and no certainly therell be some talk of substance at the 
meeting 
the new york times reported today that a cable from the us 
embassy in moscow advised officials in washington to expect 
proposals from gorbachev to lower american limits on trade and 
lending with communist countries 
it said the proposals could include greater access to american 
stock and financial markets as well as fewer limits on the ability 
of organizations such as the exportimport bank and world bank to 
underwrite loans to the soviet union 
bush meanwhile said he has made very clear to the leaders in 
the soviet union that i am most anxious to continue to seek ways to 
work together and to have progress 
but i have not assembled my national security team in toto 
he added there will not be any commitment on my part in terms of 
specific arms control proposals or things of that nature well 
listen make clear we want progress its of interest to america 
and everybody around the world in my view but not start moving 
forward in detail on strategic arms conventional force arms deals 
or anything else 
bush will not be accompanied by his own national security 
adviserdesignate brent scowcroft moreover bush is not planning 
to give his own public interpretation of the meeting leaving that 
to shultz and reagan 
shultz will give reporters a summary of the luncheon meeting 
wednesday afternoon and then fly to brussels to brief foreign 
ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization reagan 
meanwhile will give a speech in washington on wednesday night to 
the american enterprise institute a conservative research group

an unwed california father lost the last chance 
to legally restore parental ties with his 7yearold daughter 
tuesday eight days after his case was argued before the supreme 
court 
the nations highest court dashed edward mcnamaras hopes in a 
onesentence decision the appeal is dismissed for want of a 
properly presented federal question 
there was no recorded dissent 
in his appeal mcnamara contended that his parental rights had 
been terminaife 
in arguments before the justices nov 28 mcnamaras lawyer 
contended that california law unfairly discriminated against 
mcnamara by making it more difficult for him to assert his rights as 
a parent 
san diego county had defended the states policy of giving an 
unwed mother the primary right to decide whether to surrender a 
child for adoption 
the county also had argued that mcnamara waited too long to 
assert his rights 
mcnamaras lawyer james e sutherland said he felt 
disappointment and frustration for my client whos been told by 
all the california courts that he should have won this in the first 
place but because the county got possession of his daughter and 
placed her with adoptive parents it was not in a position to be 
corrected 
it seems to be an issue which has grasped the imagination of a 
lot of the public sutherland said it would have been nice to 
get a resolution on the merits of the case 
as for mcnamaras hopes of visitation the lawyer said theres 
nothing more legally we can do the trial court recommended that he 
be part of katies extended family but there hasnt been any 
accommodation he still hasnt seen her 
on the grounds for dismissal sutherland said he was surprised 
because a state appeals court had refused to consider the federal 
constitutional issues ruling that the california supreme court had 
addressed those issues and upheld the state law

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev arrived today 
for meetings with president reagan and un leaders pledging to do 
his part toward easing tensions in a world that is going through 
some very crucial changes 
gorbachev is expected to put a moderate face on soviet foreign 
policy and show himself eager to achieve progress with the new us 
administration he was expected to offer wideranging proposals on 
arms control and other issues including cuts in warsaw pact forces 
sources said 
the plane carrying gorbachev his wife raisa and three top 
soviet foreign policy advisers touched down at john f kennedy 
international airport shortly before 3 pm 
gorbachev dressed in gray overcoat and hat exited the aeroflot 
plane with his wife after the 10hour flight and walked down to the 
tarmac where they were welcomed by aly i teymour the united 
nations chief of protocol also on hand was us chief of protocol 
selwa roosevelt 
addressing the crowd gorbachev said we are living in a world 
that is going through some very crucial changes and we all all 
nations have their own concerns and interests we shall be sharing 
our concerns and interests in thinking over the current situation 
i believe that we can safely say even now that the 
conversations and the meeting itself will doubtless promote greater 
dynamism in the dialogue and relations between our two countries 
he added 
the soviet leader said he expected to meet with american business 
leaders and officials of other countries and that he hoped these 
will be useful and fruitful days we are certainly prepared to 
make our contribution toward that end 
gorbachev spoke in russian with the english translation read by 
viktor sukhudreyev a soviet foreign ministry official who has 
translated at ussoviet summits for two decades 
gorbachev was accompanied to new york by foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze and politburo member alexander n yakovlev and by 
deputy premier vladimir kamentsev according to the official tass 
news agency yuri dubinin the soviet ambassador to washington and 
his predecessor anatoly dobrynin who is now a foreign policy 
adviser to gorbachev also were on hand at the airport 
there was advance word that the soviet leader may offer new 
proposals to ease superpower tensions strengthen the united nations 
and improve the worlds environment 
a us official acknowledged the possibility of a grand 
gesture such as a reduction of soviet troops in czechoslovakia 
and hungary it is plausible they would do it on the eve of the 
opening of negotiations with the west and also as a public relations 
move said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the official told the associated press that the soviets gave no 
formal notification in advance of gorbachevs visit of a troop 
reduction however the official said it is certainly on our 
list of expectations 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact are 
expected to open talks on reducing troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear forces early next year 
a motorcade of some 45 limousines including soviet diplomats 
un officials and security officers headed for manhattan giving 
the city the first taste of the traffic tieups expected during the 
gorbachevs threeday stay it was the first visit by a soviet 
leader to new york since nikita khrushchevs 1960 trip 
the gorbachevs are staying at the soviet mission to the un a 
16mile trip from the airport 
on wednesday the soviet leader addresses the united nations and 
meets with reagan and presidentelect george bush after a day of 
sightseeing in manhattan he travels to cuba and great britain 
in a dispatch by a diplomatic correspondent distributed shortly 
after gorbachevs departure tass said gorbachev intends to discuss 
the entire range of ussoviet issues with reagan and bush 
the soviet leadership intends to talk about important 
substantive matters concerning real political cooperation between 
the two countries on the broadest range of problems including the 
state of affairs and prospects for further headway in the fields of 
arms limitation and reduction human rights a settlement of 
regional conflicts and the development of bilateral relations 
it said gorbachevs decision to address the united nations was a 
sign of soviet regard for the world body as an indispensable 
mechanism in the quest for a peaceful solution to international 
issues for resolution of crisis situations and for settlement of 
other global problems 
in several reports monday official media emphasized the new 
style of soviet diplomacy and the need for speedy progress on arms 
control issues when bush takes office in january 
in a frontpage report from new york the government newspaper 
izvestia pointedly told its readers that gorbachevs behavior at the 
un will differ markedly from khrushchevs shoethumping in 1960 
izvestia without naming khrushchev recalled how our leader 
looked then in the hall of the general assembly how he jumped up 
from place trying to interrupt speakers he didnt like pounded his 
fist on the table and not only his fist 
but it was the need for more progress on arms control that tass 
stressed it sounded an optimistic note saying four summits between 
gorbachev and reagan leading to a treaty signed a year ago 
eliminating medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles had built a 
strong and solid foundation for ussoviet relations 
it said there certainly would be future problems but expressed 
confidence the two sides could work through them 
it is perfectly natural that the new administration will need 
some time to get its bearings in the complexity of domestic and 
international problems but it is very important not to drag out 
this period marking time in international affairs especially in 
the domain of arms limitation and reduction is tantamount not only 
to loss of time but to backsliding tass said 
new york police said the gorbachevs would visit the observation 
deck of the world trade center on wednesday and drive past the stock 
exchange and through the broadway area opening a soviet export 
show viewing european paintings at the metropolitan museum of art 
and visiting central park were on the schedule thursday 
police said mrs gorbachev might also visit a department store 
wednesday 
during his trip the soviet leader will try to end soviet unions 
enemy image because the kremlin needs to divert resources from 
the military and foreign aid to solve stubborn internal problems 
soviet sources in moscow said 
gorbachev will also try to persuade fidel castro in cuba the 
costly soviet client where he is to arrive friday that it is time 
to deemphasize his penchant for revolutions the sources said 
western diplomats in moscow say the soviet union does not have 
the resources to continue spending at its current rate on its own 
military and on aid to client countries such as cuba 
gorbachev has said he wants to lessen eastwest tension to divert 
some resources from the military to improving food clothing and 
consumer goods for soviet citizens

the muchdiscussed greenhouse effect 
causing global warming is no more just a theory than gravity a 
pioneer researcher in the field said tuesday 
and the fact that global average temperatures have dropped 
sharply in the second half of 1988 should not be taken as evidence 
that the world is cooling off or not warming up he and a colleague 
agreed 
the greenhouse effect is not at all a controversial subject 
among scientists said stephen schneider of the national center for 
atmospheric research at boulder colo in a speech to a conference 
sponsored by the nonprofit climate institute 
the warming the result of a buildup of heattrapping gases in 
the atmosphere that act like the transparent glass ceiling of a 
greenhouse would result in rising sea levels stronger hurricanes 
drastic shifts in rainfall the northward migration of agricultural 
zones and more frequent droughts according to computer models 
one widely accepted prediction says the warming will amount to 
about three to eight degrees fahrenheit by sometime in the middle of 
next century 
james hansen a climatologist at the goddard institute of space 
sciences a new york citybased arm of the national aeronautics and 
space administration said a sharp cooling of the southern pacific 
ocean probably will mean the 1988 average global temperature will 
not set a record but will match or be slightly below the two 
warmest years on record 1981 and 1987 which were virtual ties 
if you want to see if theres a greenhouse effect you dont 
look just at 1988 or 1984 or any particular year but the entire 
1980s hansen said at a news conference 
even if 1988 does not set a record it will still be one of the 
five warmest years known to history all in the 1980s 
some experts have said the cooling in the southern pacific could 
presage a 30year cooling trend schneider said he sees nothing to 
support such a prediction 
the chief gas responsible for the greenhouse effect is carbon 
dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels concentrations in 
the atmosphere have risen 25 percent in the past 200 years and more 
than 10 percent in the past 30 years 
some industrial spokesmen and government officials have argued 
that the warming that scientists like schneider have predicted is 
only a theory that hasnt been proven 
but schneider defended the accuracy of computer models and said 
the only unsolved questions are how much warmer the earth will 
become and whether its going to happen in 50 or 100 years 
schneider said to people who say its only a theory i like to 
say ok gravity is only a theory please stick your neck in the 
guillotine and lets conduct todays experiment 
he urged support for energy conservation and other measures he 
said would be already justified even if the entire problem 
turns out to be fake 
hansen attracted wide attention with senate testimony in july 
that the greenhouse warming had begun though he cautioned that last 
summers heat wave in the united states could be normal climate 
variation at the time he said there was a possibility 1988 could 
be the warmest year in history

the kremlin lashed out again tuesday at officials 
in the republics of armenia and azerbaijan for their handling of an 
ethnic dispute in which at least three more people have been killed 
and six others injured 
the communist partys central committee and council of ministers 
or cabinet passed a resolution saying local officials were partly 
responsible for a mass exodus and eviction of armenians and 
azerbaijanis from their homes 
more than 180000 people have crossed the border of the two 
southern republics and the resolution said extremist groups 
were not the only ones to blame 
these actions are taking place with the connivance and 
frequently with the direct involvement of individual local party 
government and economic officials the official news agency tass 
quoted the resolution as saying 
the resolution demanded local authorities take immediate and 
decisive measures to stop the abuses 
the evening news program vremya on tuesday showed refugees 
arriving with truckloads of their belongings in azerbaijan and a 
train arriving in the armenian capital of yerevan with other 
refugees a correspondent said one armenian family took in two 
families who had fled azerbaijan because of the fear of violence 
the new deaths reported by soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
vadim perfiliev raised the death toll in the last three weeks to at 
least 31 more than 180000 people have fled their homes and crossed 
the border of the two southern republics 
official media reports also said there were an undetermined 
number of new deaths in armenia but gave no details 
three people were killed in azerbaijan but not as a result 
of clashes with law enforcement agencies perfiliev told a news 
briefing he said soldiers had fired shots but only in warning 
six people were wounded including three servicemen 
perfiliev added he did not elaborate 
the newspaper socialist industry said tuesday that curfews had 
been imposed in 14 new regions of armenia where ethnic tension has 
increased between mixed armenian and azerbaijani populations 
in regions of the republic the situation is extraordinarily 
dangerous the newspaper said there have been deaths in the 
kalinin masis and gugark region 
an editor at the official armenian news agency armenpress 
speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed there had been new 
deaths in the three northern regions but said he did not know how 
many or have any further details 
unrest has persisted despite a number of measures taken by the 
kremlin to contain it on monday the kremlin warned communist party 
officials and economic managers it would fire and prosecute them if 
they were involved in dismissing workers for ethnic reasons 
both sides in the dispute have accused the other of firing 
workers because of their ethnic background and depriving families of 
food and medical supplies 
last week president mikhail s gorbachev gathered armenian and 
azerbaijani officials and demanded an end to the ethnic strife 
officials also have imposed curfews and announced a program of 
assistance to the refugees many cities including yerevan and the 
azerbaijani capital of baku remain under military law and a strict 
curfew 
staterun baku radio said three soldiers and a medical student 
were wounded in clashes with gangs in baku on monday 
extremists and criminal elements provoked disorders on massive 
scales and attempted to commit acts of looting and other illegal 
actions in baku it said 
sources in yerevan reported that city quiet under a 11 pm5 
am curfew 
the ethnic dispute broke out in february when the predominantly 
armenian population of azerbaijans nagornokarabakh region began 
agitating for annexation by armenia 
thousands of people began demonstrating in armenia in support of 
the demand demontrations opposing it were staged in azerbaijan 
ethnic rioting broke out in the azerbaijani city of sumgait at 
the end of february and at least 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis 
were killed

the state department on tuesday distanced 
itself from the meeting in stockholm between american jews and 
palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat but a 
department spokesman said the government will be represented at a 
special united nations meeting in geneva 
were not a part of those contacts department spokesman 
charles redman said discussing the meeting of the fivemember 
jewish delegation from the united states 
redman declined comment when asked whether the government was 
informed in advance about the meeting arranged by swedish foreign 
minister sten anderssen 
redman also would not comment on reports that the egyptian 
government is trying to persuade arafat to comply with us demands 
for more explicit recognition of the state of israel than contained 
in the recent plo declaration at algiers 
arafat will be speaking at a special un assembly session that 
was moved to geneva after the united states refused on grounds of 
his terrorist connections to give arafat an entry visa to address 
the assembly in new york 
despite the furor over the visa denial the united states 
continues to be interested and active in pursuing peace in the 
middle east redman said 
the peace process will continue to be a top priority 
item he declared 
despite all this turmoil on the question of the visa that 
nonetheless has nothing to do with our regard for the palestinian 
issue and so we believe that the debate in geneva will be an 
important one and well be there he said

the parliament of the tiny baltic 
republic of estonia exercised its newly declared sovereignty for the 
first time tuesday by banning further industrial development in an 
ecologically devastated area 
the action puts estonia with a population of 16 million people 
on a collision course with moscow ministries 
estonias supreme soviet or parliament declared sovereignty 
nov 16 over all its internal affairs the presidium or executive 
council of the national parliament promptly deemed the action 
illegal but the estonians have refused to abide by that order 
saying their own constitutional amendments take precedence over 
presidium decrees 
an estonian constitutional amendment gave the republics 
parliament the power to veto soviet laws but estonian officials 
have used the measure cautiously 
on tuesday they postponed plans to override two controversial 
nationwide decrees limiting demonstrations and dissent deciding to 
ignore the decrees and instead to enforce only a more liberal 
estonian law on the same subject passed in january 
the parliamentary decision to crack down on pollution was a 
response to public anger over the worst of the moscow ministries 
excesses 
life lately has shown the ministries dont have the desire to 
go to court over matters of environmental protection estonian 
prime minister indrek toome said in explaining why estonias 
government was stepping in 
supreme soviet deputy endel lippmaa said the new environmental 
protection law could not have been passed without the powers 
contained in the nov 16 estonian constitutional amendment 
the law bans expansion of mining or other polluting industries in 
northeastern estonia which has suffered environmental damage from 
mining and pollution from power plants said lippmaa and fellow 
representative juhan aare 
aare leader of an environmental group called the estonian greens 
movement said the new law also orders the estonian council of 
ministers to write a detailed environmental cleanup plan by nov 1 
1989 
the law puts the estonian government in conflict with the moscow 
ministries that run the tallinn paper mill the viru power plant and 
the maardu chemical factory lippmaa said estonian officials have 
tried for years to persuade the bureaucrats to reduce air and water 
pollution from these facilities 
estonia has severe sulfur dioxide and dust pollution and a wide 
variey of chemicals in its groundwater lippmaa said aare said 
scientists calculated that soviet plans to open another mine would 
destroy the drinking water supply in most of estonia 
the law was passed unanimously after heated debate in which 
lawmakers considered but finally rejected the immediate closure of 
several factories 
the kremlin has shown itself willing to listen to local calls for 
environmental protection since the 1986 disaster at the chernobyl 
nuclear power plant in recent months it has canceled controversial 
water projects including a plan to divert the dnieper river in the 
eastern ukraine 
the estonian supreme soviet is to vote wednesday on a proposal to 
make estonian an official language of the republic it will also 
vote on another measure to define the arrest and deportation of tens 
of thousands of estonians during the 1940s and 1950s as crimes 
against humanity

five nations in subsaharan africa face 
famine next year although increased rain and abundant harvests in 
1988 have improved the food outlook in most other countries a un 
agency said tuesday 
sudan angola ethiopia malawi and mozambique face critical food 
shortages due to civil strife or large numbers of refugees 
according to the un food and agriculture organization 
the romebased agency said the grain harvest in ethiopia appears 
to be good but that civil war continues to impede distribution of 
food to areas affected by last years severe drought 
grain harvests also appear good in northern sudan the agency 
said but further deaths from starvation appear inevitable in 
the southern part of the country where civil strife has interfered 
with relief efforts 
western agencies estimate 260000 people have died this year in 
southern sudan because of drought and the refusal of the government 
or the rebels to permit distribution of emergency food supplies 
the international red cross and unsponsored agencies began an 
airlift of food to towns in the southern sudan on monday it was the 
first time in the 5yearold war that both sides assured the 
agencies that planes carrying aid would not be fired upon

more than 90 top us drug middlemen were indicted 
tuesday based on evidence from a sting operation in which an 
undercover fbi company sold traffickers radios navigational beacons 
and other hightech equipment 
tapes and other evidence from the operation led to drug 
indictments in miami and tampa against 93 people about five tons of 
cocaine 100 tons of marijuana and some heroin also was confiscated 
fbi director williams sessions announced in washington 
we believe that this case because of the positions and large 
numbers of those charged and arrested will have a significant 
impact on the ability of these cartels to continue to import drugs 
into the united states and abroad the fbi director said 
by tuesday afternoon about half of those charged were in custody 
in various cities around the country including los angeles boston 
houston tampa and miami the fbi said 
the 17month operation nicknamed catcom for catch 
communications was built around a hialeah fla company called ra 
communications amp computers inc set up by the fbi 
the company sold all types of communications and computer 
equipment including cellular telephones and even offered 
debugging services to its trusting clients said miami us 
attorney dexter lehtinen 
the traffickers were hiring undercover agents to sweep 
their premises littlebeknown to them that the feds were checking 
to see whether or not the feds were bugging them lehtinen said 
william e perry head of the miami fbi office said ra 
communications sold stateoftheart equipment to the traffickers 
and soon was arranging communications to allow the traffickers to 
talk directly by highband radio to their smuggling ships and their 
bosses in colombia 
the traffickers whom perry called topoftheline us 
contacts for drug lords pablo escobar gaviria jorge luis ochoa 
vasquez and jose gonzalo rodrigues gacha soon were basing their 
smuggling operations out of the hialeah company unaware that 
cameras and tape machines were recording their conversations 
ra communications essentially was used as a clubhouse or a 
meeting place for firstline drug traffickers associated with the 
medellin and cali cartels perry said 
the fbi and other agencies including the drug enforcement 
administration customs service coast guard and local law 
enforcement had to walk a thin line because they needed to keep the 
traffickers confidence while enforcing the us policy of not 
allowing any drugs to enter the country even in an undercover 
operation 
so they would creatively stop or seize the load but do it in 
such a way that would not alert the trafficking indivuiduals that 
the evidence must have been accumulated through that operation 
lehtinen said 
us naval warships and us coast guard cutters acted on 
information provided by the fbi undercover operation to interdict 
vessels carrying the drugs headed for the united states from south 
america 
the seizures occurred in mexico florida and other locations on 
land and at sea 
in one instance a sailboat containing nearly 900 pounds of 
cocaine from colombia was piloted by fbi sources hired by the drug 
traffickers the fbi had planned to seize the drugs covertly and 
tell the traffickers that the sailboat had sunk with the crew lost 
at sea 
when bad weather hit however the coast guard interceded 
rescuing the fbi and civilian personnel aboard and recovering the 
cocaine the boat sank 
among those arrested in miami are two former miami police 
officers who had been out on bond while awaiting trial in a previous 
drug case and singer raul alfonso

miles away and the work force was increased to its present level 
last month said prison superintendent mark henry

police arrested the editor of a business 
magazine tuesday but later released him after he apologized for an 
article implying kenya had changed proposed land legislation under 
pressure from britain 
attorney general matthew g muli described the article as a 
complete distortion of the whole truth of the matter and therefore 
a complete falsehood 
it involved a proposed amendment to bar foreigners from buying 
agricultural and commercial land in kenya this capitalistleaning 
east african nations annual population growth of about 38 percent 
the worlds highest has aggravated a land shortage 
peter kareithi the financial review editorinchief who was 
detained for three hours said the police referred to a sentence 
in the article and said it created the impression parliament acted 
under pressure from britain 
i agreed such an impression might have been created and 
apologized to the government and the vice president he said in a 
telephone interview 
in its dec 5 issue the magazine said the amendment was dropped 
because of hostile reaction in the former colonizing power britain 
where kenyan vice president josephat karanja was visiting to assure 
investors they still were welcome 
the review said karanja was told in no uncertain terms that the 
justpassed amendment was hostile to wouldbe investors and was 
likely to send those who had their money in the kenyan economy 
packing home 
he karanja must have hastily telephoned nairobi to say the 
bill did not augur well for continued british investments and should 
be scrapped the magazine said without attribution 
kareithi 36 said criminal investigations department director 
noah arap too told him the government was offended by the magazine 
saying karanja might have telephoned nairobi 
muli said the amendment only had been published and not passed 
when the antiforeigner clause was deleted 
parliament passed the amendment oct 14 without imposing 
restrictions on foreigners buying land 
kareithis arrest also followed government criticism of a nov 28 
editorial alleging government officials were involved in flooding 
the kenyan market with imported gunny sacks while local bag makers 
have had to lay off 3000 workers the bags are used primarily for 
grain and produce 
two days after the editorial appeared a government statement 
said the insinuations implied in the editorial are malicious in 
bad taste and are calculated to ridicule the government 
earlier this year the government banned the magazine beyond 
published by kenyas national christian council of churches after 
it described feb 22 primary parliamentary elections as a mockery 
of democracy

stanford university economist michael boskin 
chosen to be presidentelect george bushs chief economic adviser 
said tuesday that the new administration will be successful in 
cutting the budget deficit while upholding bushs campaign pledge to 
avoid new taxes 
one of the key architects of bushs flexible freeze boskin 
defended the proposal saying that it would produce a balanced budget 
through holding the growth of overall spending to the rate of 
inflation 
boskin a conservative economist who served as a top bush 
campaign adviser was named by the presidentelect to be chairman of 
his council of economic advisers 
critics of the flexible freeze have charged it is unworkable and 
would force draconian reductions in some areas of domestic spending 
to make up for faster growth in such programs as social security 
which bush has vowed to leave untouched 
in a speech tuesday before his appointment was announced boskin 
defended the flexible freeze and predicted that it could balance the 
budget somewhere around 1993 depending on how fast the economy 
grows in the next few years 
i think you will see the bush administration take strong action 
on the budget deficit quickly after the inauguration and i think it 
will be on the spending side of the budget consistent with the 
flexible freeze boskin told a policy conference sponsored by the 
american enterprise institute 
bush on tuesday also named texas oilman robert mosbacher as 
secretary of commerce and tapped carla hills to be trade 
representative bush earlier announced his choice of richard darman 
as his budget director and asked treasury secretary nicholas brady 
to stay on in the new administration 
in making the economic appointments bush pledged that his 
administration would take the lead in proposing a solution to 
congress to reduce the budget deficit which climbed to 1551 
billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
i do feel the urgency of getting something moving on the 
deficit front and i will do my level best early on to take the 
offense bush said he said he would not simply leave the problem 
up to congress to solve 
i am not going to do that i am going to lead bush said but 
he refused to be specific on how detailed a budget proposal he 
planned to submit once he takes office saying his advisers were 
still working on those details 
boskin in his speech responded to critics who charge that the 
flexible freeze will not produce a balanced budget because of new 
spending demands on government and rapid growth in such politically 
sensitive programs as social security and medicare 
its certainly valid technical economics if your goal is to get 
to a balanced budget in the 1993 period give or take a year 
boskin said 
i can assure you that people who are very careful with numbers 
myself included have gone over this and it is eminently doable 
he said so the accusations that this doesnt add up are kind of 
silly and not based on economic reality 
boskin said bush would quickly appoint budget negotiators to work 
with congress on a spending compromise 
i know bush takes the deficit very seriously and i expect him 
to deal forcefully with it early on he said

the labor department is advising employers who 
anticipate closing their plants or implementing large layoffs in 
february to start providing 60 days advance notice as of tuesday 
despite some confusion over the timetable of the new law 
although the plantclosing notice law formally the worker 
adjustment and retraining notification or warn act does not take 
effect until feb 4 there have been different interpretations on 
whether companies should begin providing 60 days notice then or 60 
days beforehand 
some also have interpreted the new law as requiring notices for 
the first 60 days after feb 4 limited to the number of days between 
that date and when the layoffs or plant closing actually occur 
under that interpretation a layoff occurring next march 6 would 
require only 30 days advance notice to the affected workers and 
local government officials 
in an interim interpretive rule the labor department said 
all three interpretations have merit 
but until the department issues final regulatons by next april or 
the issue is resolved in court it said in a federal register notice 
that employers are best advised to proceed conservatively and to 
provide notice as early as dec 6 in view of this possible 
liability 
no notice is required for layoffs or plant closings that occur 
between now and feb 4 
the law was passed by congress last july and enacted on aug 4 
without the signature of president reagan who called it a step in 
the wrong direction 
in may reagan had vetoed a trade bill largely because it 
required 60 days notices for plant closings and layoffs of more 
than 50 people at a time 
but after polls showed that more than 80 percent of the public 
favored the mandatory notices democrats and labor unions moved to 
pass the measure as a separate law holding the trade bill hostage 
in the meantime the trade bill also eventually passed congress and 
was signed by reagan 
a 15year battle to win the mandatory notices was renewed by the 
aflcio in 1986 after an average 22 million workers a year lost 
their jobs to plant closings and mass layoffs through the first half 
of the decade 
government studies showed that more than half of those workers 
received less than two weeks advance notice and that only 18 
percent of the employers gave three weeks or more notice 
the laws enactment was the labor federations first major 
legislative victory over business opposition since last getting 
minimum wage increases through congress in 1978 
since last october the labor department had been advising 
business groups they should look upon dec 6 as the day to start 
providing the notices for layoffs occurring after feb 4 so have 
major business groups which vigorously opposed the law including 
the us chamber of commerce and national association of 
manufacturers 
sue meisinger a vice president for the american society of 
personnel administration said the effective date that notices are 
required is one of several ambiguities in the law 
youre going to find out how the ambiguities work out only 
after litigation she said there are a lot of issues to be 
played out over time a lot of employers are going to find out how 
the law works only after they get slapped with a civil complaint 
because the law does not empower any agency to enforce it 
failure to comply with it can be addressed only thourgh civil suits 
filed by affected employees unions or local governments in federal 
courts 
the courts are empowered to order up to 60 days in back pay and 
benefits plus attorneys fees to affected workers and up to 30000 
to local governments who did not get the required notices 
basically the law forbids companies employing 100 or more 
fulltime workers at any one location from ordering a plant closed 
or a mass layoff involving 50 or more people until 60 days after 
they have imformed the affected employees and local government 
officials about it 
exempted from coverage are companies with fewer than 100 
fulltime workers temporary layoffs of less than six months and 
layoffs caused by natural disasters such as last summers drought 
employers also do not have to provide the 60 days advance notice 
of the layoffs were caused by unforeseeable business circumstances 
such as the unexpected cancellation of a major contract 
international oil shortages or strikes and lockouts

ronald h brown jesse jacksons chief 
operative at last summers democratic convention entered the race 
for chairman of the party tuesday with a declaration that he was 
seeking the office as my own man 
brown who also worked on the presidential campaigns of sen 
edward m kennedy walter mondale and michael dukakis said at a 
press conference he was an independent mainstream progressive 
democrat independent of jackson or any other party leader 
brown said he considered himself the frontrunner in what was 
shaping up as at least a fiveway race to succeed paul kirk the 
democratic national committee chairman who announced monday he would 
leave his post after four years 
and while welcoming the support of jacksons supporters on the 
dnc brown emphasized his long party service and independence 
im nobodys candidate im my own man he said if elected 
no one will be given the advantage as the party looks toward 
1992 he said 
also running or expected to run for the party post were michigan 
democratic chairman richard wiener and former reps michael barnes 
of maryland jim jones of oklahoma and jim stanton of ohio 
wiener who announced his candidacy for the national post monday 
told reporters tuesday he planned to spend upwards of 100000 on 
the race and would release in about two weeks a list of dnc 
supporters representing all regions of the country 
i believe i enter as a strong contender as a favorite he 
said downplaying other candidates counts of supporters and 
refusing to release his own adding together the numbers of 
supporters claimed by each candidate would yield double the 404 
members on the dnc he said 
the dnc meets feb 910 in washington to select a new chairman 
all of the other candidates are good democrats said wiener 
who described himself as having a political philosphy modeled after 
that of john f kennedy 
instead of philosophy the ability to run the party machinery 
would be foremost the outgoing president of the association of 
state democratic chairs said 
i believe the most important job is to have this party 
ready in 1992 to win the presidency of the united states he said 
the party needed to build a fighting machine to counter the 
republican apparatus which will be headed by lee atwater who was 
george bushs campaign manager 
what is needed is to build upon kirks fundraising and 
organizational efforts he said but not changing the partys basic 
message 
i do not believe it was a philosphical problem in this 
election he said michael dukakis allowed himself to be 
defined in a way that distorted democratic values which he said 
included a strong defense and no tolerance of crime 
barnes declared his candidacy in a mailgram sent out monday to 
democratic leaders jones planned to make a formal announcement next 
week while stanton said monday he was looking forward to a 
candidacy

plo chief yasser arafat met with a group 
of american jews on tuesday to promote his new image of moderation 
and build support for the declaration of an independent palestinian 
state issued last month 
the meeting arranged by the swedish government took place a 
week before arafat is to address the un general assembly in 
geneva the assembly decided to move its session from new york to 
the european un headquarters when the united states refused arafat 
a visa 
a swedish government statement after the meeting said major 
issues were addressed and important progress was made when 
reporters asked arafat about the results of the meeting he replied 
it is better to wait and see 
mounted police sealed off the snowcovered park around the haga 
palace where arafat and aides conferred with the fivemember jewish 
delegation from the united states 
foreign minister sten andersson was in the 18th century building 
for the first hour of the meeting then left and returned two hours 
later for the end 
ingvar carlsson the prime minister cut short a trip to paris to 
return home and act as host at a dinner for the two delegations 
he greeted arafat with an embrace after the meeting and received 
the jewish group at his office 40 minutes later none of the 
delegation members commented to reporters 
rita hauser led the jewish group she is chairman of the us 
branch of the international center for peace in the middle east a 
coalition of leftist organizations in israel and other countries 
abba eban former israeli foreign minister is international 
chairman of the center its israeli branch includes prominent 
members of the centerleft labor party of foreign minister shimon 
peres to which eban belongs 
the center believes israel should give up at least some of the 
arab territory captured in the 1967 middle east war and many of its 
members urge the israeli government to deal directly with the 
palestine liberation organization 
israel and several jewish organizations protested the meeting 
the israeli foreign ministry lodged an official protest with the 
swedish ambassador 
an israeli source said privately a message was sent to one 
participant menachem rosensaft of the labor zionist alliance by 
his groups parent organization ordering him to resign all official 
positions 
swedens foreign ministry described the delegation members as 
prominent personalities representing a significant portion of 
us jewish opinion but an israeli diplomat in stockholm dismissed 
them as unimportant he spoke on condition of anonymity 
benjamin cohen president of the american zionist federation 
issued a statement in new york saying the americans who are at 
the meeting are participating for their own benefit without the 
support of any recognized organization in the jewish community 
israeli refuses to deal with the plo and has made it a criminal 
offense for any israeli citizen to do so it has urged israels us 
supporters to abstain from contacts with an organization it 
describes as a band of terrorists 
other members of the jewish delegation were drora kass the 
centers executive director stanley sheinbaum an economist and 
publisher from los angeles and avraham udovitch chairman of the

meeting the newspaper aftonbladet called it a personal triumph for 
the foreign minister

the middle east 
andersson has urged israel to respond to what he called the 
historic decisions announced nov 15 in algiers when the plo 
accepted un resolutions that recognize israel 
carlsson told reporters before leaving paris in an apparent 
reference to the plo and israel if a dialogue can be started 
between the two parties it would be a major breakthrough

public schools in dade county where 17 children have 
been killed by guns this year plan to go ahead with a say no to 
guns program despite opposition from the national rifle 
association 
i have not seen the materials but it seems like an attempt to 
terrorize and scare the children rather than to educate them in a 
calm sane manner said marion hammer head of the nras florida 
chapter 
but joe fernandez dades school superintendent says he doesnt 
care what the nra thinks 
if it was in my power wed outlaw guns completely fernandez 
said 
the 25000 guns kill say no to guns program drawn up in 
reaction to the unprecedented number of dade children killed by guns 
this year will begin friday only days after a junior at miami 
palmetto high school died of gunshot wounds 
sixteenyearold lowell thomas jr was gunned down by someone in 
a car outside his familys apartment sunday night according to 
metro police investigators say they have identified two suspects a 
palmetto high dropout and a current student at the school 
beginning friday dade county school children are to be 
instructed that the best way to handle a gun is to not pick it up in 
the first place 
school officials hope the message of their unprecedented gun 
safety awareness program will help prevent accidental deaths if not 
deliberate killings 
im not sure if the gun safety awareness program is geared to 
cope with premeditated murder said school board member janet 
mcaliley this program should help to prevent accidental deaths 
such as when a child picks up a gun that may or not be loaded 
fernandez agreed 
we are not focused on those who have criminal intent im not 
sure what we could do about that fernandez said were focused 
on kids who wind up playing with guns either they dont know 
theyre loaded or they play russian roulette 
but hammer argued the schools are taking the wrong approach 
hammer said she knows there is a lot of anguish after a handgun 
slaying especially when the victim is a teenager but she 
insists that you cant teach by scaring someone to death 
hammer added if just say no campaigns worked our drug 
problem wouldnt exist anymore 
the new program expected to be formally approved at wednesdays 
board meeting starts with principals reading a prepared text during 
the morning announcements followed by a discussion between students 
and teachers at the elementary and middleschool level 
phased in throughout the year will be parent workshops public 
service announcements and for older students a video detailing the 
consequences of getting shot and the agonizing recovery period 
the nra had proposed teaching gun safety classes but the schools 
rejected the idea 
a proposal by the nra this fall to distribute its gun safety 
coloring book in chicago schools is still being considered by the 
board of education there school board spokesman bob saigh said

the biological father of a child cannot 
stake a claim to the infant if he failed to support its mother 
during pregnancy an attorney told the florida supreme court tuesday 
in a custody case 
the court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignored 
his pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion can 
retain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up for 
adoption 
the putative father knew from the very beginning that his woman 
was pregnant said attorney chandler muller who represented the 
adoptive parents known as bob and jane doe in the case he turned 
his back on the developing child 
muller said he hoped the court will have the courage to look at 
prebirth abandonment 
the youngster is called john doe and his natural parents have 
been dubbed richard and mary roe because of courtordered anonymity 
john l odonnell jr attorney for the natural parents who 
were not married at the time of the boys birth in september 1986 
argued before the court that the natural father did everything the 
law allowed to assert his rights 
our position has always been the statute allows consideration 
only of postbirth activity said odonnell im not saying this 
man was perfect but this is not a man who turned his back and 
walked away 
the mother was encouraged by her rabbi and an attorney to give 
the baby up for adoption after the father initially refused to marry 
her and urged her to have an abortion 
in july 1986 the mother moved from phoenix to winter park where 
the adoptive parents provided an apartment paid her medical 
expenses and gave her 300 a month for expenses 
she spoke confidently of giving up the baby in talks with the 
adoptive parents lawyer and a state social worker saying the 
natural father had abandoned her she gave written consent for the 
adoption two days after the boys birth 
the infant went home with his new parents sept 15 the same day 
the father learned of the birth two days later the father 
contacted an attorney to file papers acknowleding paternity hoping 
to stop the adoption without his consent 
the couple reconciled and were married in november 1986 two 
months after the baby was born the mother supports her husbands 
fight for the infants return 
in june 1987 a judge ruled against the father saying he had 
effectively abandoned the child during the mothers pregnancy but 
the 5th district court of appeal reversed the ruling in march 
saying it was necessary to have the consent of the biological father 
the appeals court left the adoptive parents with custody of the 
boy until the supreme court reviews the case 
the attorneys said they expected a decision could take anywhere 
from a few weeks to several months

the state department reporting on the eve of 
the ussoviet meeting said tuesday there have been significant 
human rights improvements inside the soviet union under president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
but the department also said those improvements have been uneven 
and marked by reversals and inconsistencies and moscow remains in 
violation of the human rights provisions of the helsinki accord in 
part because of its continuing occupation of afghanistan 
moscow committed itself to withdrawing from afghanistan by feb 
15 but the soviets announced a suspension last month complaining 
about attacks on the red army by usarmed afghan guerrillas 
the report also said the soviets continue to undermine the 
basic principles of the helsinki agreement on relations between 
nations by supporting the vietnamese occupation of cambodia 
the conclusions were contained in the state departments 
semiannual report to congress on implementation of the helsinki 
agreement which involves 33 european nations the united states and 
canada the accord was aimed at promoting cooperation among the 
nations and the protection of human rights 
the report was issued one day before gorbachev meets with 
president reagan roved 
considerably in 1988 and cited increases in emigration the 
release of some but not all political prisoners and reform of the 
practice of committing political offenders to mental hospitals 
there were reports of fewer beatings in psychiatric 
hospitals the report said dissidents reported that the 
punitive use of drugs continued however and compiled a list of 90 
individuals known to have been in psychiatric hospitals at one time 
and whose whereabouts are unknown today 
the report said unofficial groups and publications continued to 
flourish although some activities were subjected to harsh press 
attacks 
a july 28 decree by the supreme soviet on demonstrations had a 
mixed impact the report said permitting some large demonstrations 
while forbidding others 
the report said that some of the more than 30000 unofficial 
groups formed since gorbachev began to implement his new policies 
are political parties in all but name and said two of them have 
publicly declared themselves to be opposition political parties 
on the whole soviet authorities were tolerant of these groups 
although they endeavored to channel their activities the report 
said 
but it said the changes have not yet been made permanent through 
the adoption of appropriate legislation and regulations to 
guarantee respect for individual rights 
although the diminishing numbers of political prisoners 
signaled positive progress the report said the lack of legal 
protection of individual rights continued to permit the arbitrary 
use of power by soviet authorities 
it said that although the numbers of political prisoners have 
fallen substantially to an estimated 100 to 200 conditions in 
labor camps continued to be deplorable 
the report said recently released prisoners cited inadequate 
diet poor or no medical treatment beatings repeated sentences in 
punishment cells and few or no family visits or correspondence 
however it noted that on july 25 the soviet presidium struck 
from the criminal code a provision mandating reduced rations for 
prisoners in punishment and isolation cells 
on the subject of religious activity the report said that 
while there have been positive developments freedom to profess 
ones religion remains severely restricted in the soviet union

the brass and marble were polished the holiday 
decorations were hung and all was ready for a publicists dream 
donald trump famous capitalist guiding mikhail gorbachev famous 
communist through the lobby of trump tower famous temple of 
conspicuous consumption 
but when the soviet leaders final itinerary or at least his 
final tentative itinerary was released monday trump and his tower 
had been dealt out 
soviet officials said the original announcement that trump was on 
the tour was the result of a misunderstanding but trump aides said 
the soviets had told them gorbachev would visit and secret service 
agents had checked out the fifth avenue building 
norma foederer trumps top aide said that gorbachevs schedule 
was too tight for a visit to the tower but that trump and his wife 
ivana were invited to a reception at the soviet mission thursday 
night 
trumps spokesman dan klores said last week that the developer 
met gorbachev at a white house dinner during the soviet leaders 
last visit to the united states when he heard gorbachev was coming 
to new york he wrote him a note inviting him to visit trump tower 
and the plaza hotel which trump also owns 
a trumpgorbachev meeting had been criticized by advocates of the 
homeless who in turn offered to show gorbachev another side of the 
city the soviet leader also spurned that offer 
on tuesday however as he walked through the towers lobby 
trump must have thought for a moment that his luck had changed 
there was gorbachev head birthmark and all surrounded by crowds of 
people 
in cruel fact a crew from the syndicated television program a 
current affair had brought the winner of a gorbachev lookalike 
contest to the tower to introduce him to trump as the real thing 
according to isabelle fernandes a spokeswoman for the program

looked like he might have been him but when you got close you

presidentelect george bush and rep dan 
rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
disagreed over the need to raise taxes tuesday but cemented what 
they said was a longtime friendship 
we talked about taxes but he did not change his position at 
all rostenkowski said after the illinois democrat ate lunch with 
bush at the vice presidents office 
bush was very firm in the fact that he did not want to discuss 
the increasing of revenue said the head of the taxwriting panel 
everybody knows my position on taxes said bush who vowed 
during the campaign to hold firm against tax hikes 
when rostenkowski broached his idea of raising the federal 
gasoline tax by 10 or 15 cents per gallon bush replied thats 
interesting that is as far as he went with respect to discussing 
taxes the congressman said 
a 15cent increase in the gas tax would bring in about 15 
billion annually a mere dent in the 150billionayeardeficit 
rostenkowski echoing the line of some congressional democrats 
said he does not think the deficit can be brought down without 
increasing revenues and cutting domestic and defense spending 
in rostenkowskis view lingering high deficits will destabilize 
the economy to the point where the nations standard of living will 
decline 
but he said the decision to initiate tax increases is in the 
hands of the presidentelect the democrats will not take such a 
step 
earlier rostenkowski predicted bush would have little trouble 
backing away from his notaxincrease pledge if he wants to do so 
while the men were at odds over taxes bush said they enjoy each 
other what we did today is renew a friendship the 
presidentelect said bush served on ways and means with 
rostenkowski when he was a congressman from texas in the late 1960s 
said rostenkowski george bush is the same george bush he was 
when he was a member of congress he has a great perception of 
what the legislative process is he has called bush a friend 
bush will also have an easier time dealing with congress because 
he understands the system rostenkowski said 
rostenkowski announced tuesday that his committee will holding 
hearings beginning jan 31 on whether the tax code should be changed 
as a result of the recent wave of corporate takeovers especially 
those requiring huge debts 
it is apropriate to ask if these transactions allow certain 
corporations to escape the payment of fair taxes thereby harming 
the average american taxpayer said rostenkowski who made no 
specific proposal for a new tax or other change in the law 
meanwhile speaking at a breakfast sponsored by the gannett co 
inc the incoming chairman of the senate budget committee predicted 
that bush would have to ask for a tax increase before the midway 
point of his term 
my view is there will be additional taxes within the next 
two years said sen james r sasser dtenn bush would again ask 
people to read my lips he said but this time hell be saying 
lets get some additional revenue in the till

at a speech in new york tuesday night rostenkowski argued 
against imposing a national sales tax or making major changes in the 
income tax 
a sales tax would require a new administrative structure 
rostenkowski said and although there may be some remaining 
deductions and exclusions that could be reduced the income taxes 
ought not be a candidate for serious surgery 
he argued against any soaktherich tax increase saying any plan 
must be balanced and he rejected a favorite bush campaign proposal 
to cut the tax on capital gains as a plan that would hand more money 
to the rich not raise federal revenues

a conservative group said tuesday it is 
organizing a drive to flood the white house switchboard with calls 
urging president reagan to pardon oliver north before he leaves 
office in january 
the president has indicated he will not issue a pardon for north 
who is under indictment for his role in the irancontra affair but 
he also has said he will not give up classified government documents 
that north says he needs for his defense a position that could keep 
north from coming to trial 
we are disappointed but undaunted robert grant president of 
the american freedom coalition said of reagans refusal so far to 
pardon north we will not halt our national project until col 
north is either exonerated by the courts or justly pardoned by the 
president 
north was a lieutenant colonel in the marine corps on the 
national security council staff under adm john poindexter when the 
alleged offenses occurred involving the diversion to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels of proceeds from us arms sales to iran 
grant and three other wellknown conservatives held a news 
conference against a backdrop of dozens of mail bags which they said 
held petitions for a north pardon that would be delivered to the 
white house 
we believe that north and his family have already been severely 
and justly punished through public humiliation and extensive legal 
defense fees grant said this is no way in my opinion to 
treat a patriotic war hero who had the guts to stand up to congress 
and its wishy washy onandoff support of the freedom fighters 
peter t flaherty chairman of citizens for reagan said the 
president is going out of office a winner but that if north is 
not pardoned the reagan foreign policy will be on trial for 
several months after hes left office he said failure to pardon 
north will confirm congressional control of foreign policy 
richard viguerie chairman of united conservatives of america 
said only three groups want a trial for north the press which 
likes a hot story democrats who want to keep the bush 
administration on the defensive foreign enemies who will benefit 
by having our country divided and our intelligence systems paralyzed 
at the start of a new administration 
richard ichord a former congressman from missouri and vice 
chairman of grants group said north was caught up in a policy 
dispute between congress and reagan 
the country he said has little to gain and much to lose from 
a criminal trial that could require the disclosure of national 
secrets and even the testimony of a former president and a sitting 
president in order to protect the rights of the accused

a former nursing home supervisor charged 
with killing two patients told police her alleged accomplice killed 
six elderly patients all but one for the emotional release it 
provided her according to court documents 
catherine wood 26 and former nurses aide gwendolyn graham 25 
are suspects in eight deaths last year at alpine manor nursing home 
in this grand rapids suburb authorities said 
wood was charged monday with two counts of murder and held 
without bond pending a dec 16 preliminary hearing graham was 
arrested sunday near her home in tyler texas and arraigned on one 
count of murder she is being held on 1 million bond while fighting 
extradition to michigan 
during questioning by police oct 7 wood said graham had 
suffocated the elderly patients in their beds and collected a 
souvenir from each according to search warrants released monday 
she said graham told her that each of the killings provided an 
emotional release for her with the exception of the death of 
97yearold edith cook who was killed to end her suffering from 
gangrene the court document said 
wood also told police that she and graham lived together from 
september 1986 to july 1987 and were involved as lovers in a 
homosexual relationship the documents said the alleged killings 
occurred between january and may 1987 
wood told police she witnessed the jan 18 1987 killing of 
60yearold marguerite chambers an alzheimers disease patient she 
observed gwendolyn gail graham suffocating the patient by 
pressing a washcloth beneath the chin of chambers and another 
washcloth over chambers mouth and nose the warrant said wood 
told police she did not intervene 
wood also told police graham would tell her of the killings 
either just before or after they occurred 
at the time of their deaths the eight female patients were 
believed to have died from natural causes and no autopsies were 
performed 
wood who worked at the home from july 1985 to this october and 
most recently was supervisor of nurses aides is charged with 
killing cook and chambers graham who worked at the home from june 
1986 to july 1987 is charged with killing cook both bodies were 
exhumed last week but autopsies have proven inconclusive 
both aides had received good marks from patients and neither was 
fired nursing home officials said 
walker police chief walt sprenger said tuesday six more deaths 
were being investigated and that more charges against the two women 
were likely he said he did not know if any other bodies would be 
exhumed 
sprenger would not discuss possible motives in the case but has 
ruled out mercy killings and financial profit he said the womens 
lesbian relationship was part of a complex web that brings the 
whole thing together 
woods exhusband who first approached police about the deaths 
in october 1988 and sparked the investigation told police his 
former wife admitted helping while graham suffocated the patients 
hoping to spell the word murder with the victims initials the 
warrants said 
sprenger said he has not been able to substantiate that 
allegation the initials of the alleged victims identified in 
warrants and by relatives contacted by nursing home officials do 
not spell out murder 
employees at the nursing home said wood had a quick temper 
she wood would throw diapers at me and cuss at me patricia 
patterson a nurses aide at alpine told the grand rapids press 
cathy was always such an angry person

presidentelect george bush should not accept 
the conventional wisdom that political realities dictate 
pentagon budget cuts the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
tuesday 
members of congress who offer that wisdom to the incoming 
administration seldom have much to say to me or to our citizens 
about overseas threats or military realities which do not conform 
to their version of political reality added adm william j crowe 
jr the joint chiefs chairman 
this inability to consider strategic questions in a reasonable 
and consistent manner is both inefficient and dangerous he said 
adding the danger is intensified because the nations fiscal 
problems are occuring at a time of relative peace around the world 
in war we remember the alamo the maine pearl harbor in good 
times we forget 
crowe spoke tuesday night before the world affairs council of 
washington offering a broad review of military and diplomatic 
affairs at home and abroad a text of his speech was released in 
advance by the pentagon 
the fourstar admiral said he wanted to work with bush to improve 
pentagon management to convince congress that stable financing 
instead of peakandvalley cycles could save huge amounts of money 
and to continue improving the nations ability to fight guerrilla 
wars 
like everything else pentagon management is not as bad as the 
critics say nor as good as some defenders argue crowe said 
but nevertheless we are going to need strong leadership to 
implement a wide range of reforms 
the nations top military officer said he understood the pentagon 
was unlikely to get all the money it wanted but he said he would 
counsel bush not to reduce military manpower or the funds needed to 
preserve readiness 
adjustments some of them significant are clearly ahead as 
we conform our forces and our collective security approach to 
emerging international realities and evolving challenges including 
economic considerations he declared 
but it would be a grievous and probably ultimately disabling 
error to undertake those adjustments with an eye only to the 
concerns of accountants 
crowe said the diplomatic and military situation in asia and the 
pacific rim was probably the most stable the situation in the 
middle east central and south america and near east the least and 
europe in between 
the problem in europe is that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
talks about reforming his nations economy and downplaying defense 
but russian military forces are still most formidable structured 
and postured for the offensive and backed up by a continued 
commitment to modernization crowe said 
in the pacific the united states will face the challenging 
issue of retaining access to forward bases but he said that more 
important are mideast tensions latin american drug trafficking the 
threat of terrorism and the need to preserve access to overseas oil 
well need flexibility and openmindedness on all sides as 
well as the wisdom tenacity and political courage to take a long 
view of the national interest crowe said its going to be a 
tough road in a frequently shortsighted town

the government said tuesday it is changing 
its attitude toward solidarity founder lech walesa and indicated one 
of his main advisers could accompany him to france 
government spokesman jerzy urban said the reply may be 
positive to the passport application of historian bronislaw 
geremek 
president francois mitterrand of france has invited walesa 
winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize to attend observances saturday 
of the 40th anniversary of the declaration of the universal rights 
of man 
walesa was told last saturday he could make the trip but he 
wanted geremek whose specialty is french medieval history and who 
speaks fluent french to accompany him 
geremek said sunday that he had been refused a passport on all 
five recent occasions when he applied 
adam michnik another walesa adviser said from gdansk on tuesday 
that walesa planned to leave friday and return sunday 
it would the first time authorities have granted walesa a 
passport since the free trade union was suppressed and outlawed 
after the imposition of martial law in december 1981 
permission for the trip coincided with signs of a more positive 
feeling toward walesa by authorities 
there has been a change of attitude toward walesa urban 
confirmed at his news conference 
citing walesas statements during a nov 30 nationally televised 
debate with official unions chief alfred miodowicz and his public 
statements since urban said it was a different lech walesa than 
the one who in past years many times spoke in a confrontational 
spirit 
is this new walesa growing to be a partner going to be 
stable is he going to keep this tone which dominated his television 
statements i think yes urban said 
in another development solidarity spokesmen said walesa was 
allowed to address about 4000 students monday night in an unusual 
meeting in a gdansk university lecture hall and answer questions 
about his debate with miodowicz 
the meeting was organized by the banned but active independent 
students association roughly the campus equivalent of solidarity 
and was attended by some university officials said michnik 
walesa was quoted by solidarity spokesman robert kozak as telling 
the students many interesting things are happening now may poles 
really reach agreement and find a place for themselves

federal and local troubleshooters watched 
mikhail gorbachevs arrival tuesday on a video screen in a darkened 
vaultlike room at police headquarters which has been turned into a 
command center for his visit 
its an assembly of people who are problemsolvers said 
deputy inspector james vitti the premise is that we have one 
location where people who can speak for their agencies are available 
to cope with any potential problem that may develop 
more than 20 agencies including the fbi the secret service the 
coast guard the federal aviation administration the fire 
department the citys traffic department and its ambulance corps 
were represented 
two long tables with banks of telephones and a 26footby10foot 
video screen dominated the room one side panel of the screen 
contained a slide of time magazines man of the year cover that 
depicted the soviet leader 
in the middle panel television coverage of gorbachevs arrival 
alternated between local stations and cable news network 
we would define success as having nothing to do for the next 
three days vitti said 
but the command center which is in constant contact with agents 
and officers in the field was called upon at least three times 
before gorbachev and his wife raisa were safely delivered to the 
soviet mission in manhattan from kennedy international airport 
the first call came before their arrival when motorists on the 
long island expressway became impatient with detours and drove up on 
the grass to avoid roadblocks 
this problem went to police officials who dispatched extra 
patrols to turn back the motorists 
another traffic problem arose on the van wyck expressway in 
queens when a propane truck broke down in a lane that was to be 
closed for gorbachevs motorcade 
the representative for the city transportation department at the 
command center ordered the immediate dispatch of a tow truck which 
removed the disabled vehicle 10 minutes before gorbachev left the 
airport 
as the motorcade traveled down the grand central parkway in 
queens another call came in to the command center a private 
helicopter hired by a news organization was hovering too close to 
the procession of 45 cars 
the faa representative notified the closest air control tower and 
the helicopter was told to pull back 
when the motorcade pulled into the soviet mission police lt 
vincent kennedy said as an old friend of mine used to say it 
went like ice cream no problems

irancontra prosecutors sought tuesday to 
foreclose oliver l norths ability to disclose government secrets 
at trial by conceding that some covert operations financed by 
iranian arms sales were legal 
the concessions were made in memoranda filed at the request of 
us district judge gerhard a gesell who is conducting closed 
hearings on the use of classified documents at a public trial 
declassified versions of the briefs were unsealed late tuesday in 
us district court 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said he would not offer 
proof that north approved a variety of expenditures from the secret 
fund that was amassed from the sale of us weapons to iran 
the prosecutor said he wouldnt offer evidence about payments to 
drug enforcement administration agents to help free american 
hostages in lebanon nor would there be proof that north approved 
200000 in payments to nicaraguan rebel leaders the spending of 
320000 to buy a danish ship used for a variety of clandestine 
operations and 100000 to buy radios for a foreign political group 
not specified in the indictment 
walsh said he was willing to concede for the purposes of this 
case that this group of expenditures went to programs otherwise 
lawful but not within the iran finding in which president reagan 
approved the arms sales to make contact with moderate elements of 
iran and to free us hostages 
the government will concede for the purposes of this trial that 
none of the expenditures went to programs which were themselves 
illegal except those for the support of the military and 
paramilitary activities of the contras walsh said 
as a result of these concessions the government maintains that 
the use of classified documents to demonstrate the bona fides of the 
programs supported by certain of the proceeds of the iranian arms 
sales is unjustified in light of the governments theory of the 
case walsh said 
the concessions were made after reagan stated last week that his 
administration would not allow public disclosure of virtually any of 
the secret material that north wants to use to defend the charge he 
conspired to defraud the government 
white house refusal to release 40000 pages of documents sought 
by north and sensitive material censored from 395 documents walsh 
plans to use as prosecution exhibits threatens to scuttle the 
central charges against the former national security council aide 
the indictment charges that north and arms dealers albert hakim 
and retired air force maj gen richard v secord sold us arms to 
iran at an inflated price to create profits from which more than 
14 million was diverted to the nicaraguan rebels also indicted is 
former national security adviser john m poindexter the four are to 
be tried separately 
gesell is holding secret hearings on norths requests to disclose 
certain classified information at the trial the classified 
information procedures act provides for dismissal of charges if the 
government refuses to release documents that are needed for a fair 
trial 
of particular concern to the reagan administration is any 
information about efforts to free americans held in lebanon by 
proiranian groups walsh said earlier this year that release of 
such information could expose hostages and others to torture or 
death 
by making the concessions that he did walsh apparently hopes to 
narrow the focus of the case against north thereby reducing the 
defenses need to disclose classified information to defend the 
charge that the former presidential aide illegally diverted 
usiran armssale proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels 
walsh contended his concessions dont undermine the basic thrust 
of his case against north 
the crime charged is norths participation in a conspiracy 
by which he fraudulently obtained control through his official 
position but without governmental accountability over funds 
generated by a united states government initiative walsh said 
because this is the crime charged it is irrelevant whether 
he then exercised his control in order to fund what the government 
will concede are valid projects he said 
the crime lies in the control that north deceitfully obtained 
and maintained over those funds the allegations of expenditures 
directed by north are relevant only on the issue of control 
norths crime lies in how he acquired and maintained control of 
these funds not in the specific purposes for which he spent them 
walsh said 
no date has been set for norths trial secord hakim and 
poindexter will be tried separately after norths case is concluded

a report released a us human rights group 
tuesday criticized israel for imprisoning palestinians without trial 
and inhumane conditions at a prison camp in the negev desert 
the lawyers committee for human rights based in new york city 
compiled its 95page report after factfinding missions to israel 
and the occupied territories its representatives heard testimony 
from palestinian lawyers and human rights workers and interviewed 
israeli officials 
among cases cited in the report is the detention in recent months 
of four palestinian field workers for al haq a human rights group 
in the occupied west bank and two lawyers from the occupied gaza 
strip 
all four were placed under administrative detention an emergency 
measure allowing for detention of up to six months without charges 
or trial the two lawyers have been released 
the administrative detention is a serious blow to 
independent human rights monitoring in the west bank the report 
said 
it also outlined abuses in the ketziot prison where thousands of 
palestinians have been detained during the yearold palestinian 
revolt against israeli rule in the occupied territories 
about 2500 palestinians are believed held in ketziot 1500 
under administrative detention 
ketziots location in a remote part of israel proper its 
extremely harsh desert climate and its crowded inhumane living 
conditions combine to create an untenable environment in which to 
maintain longterm detainees the report said 
at ketziot arabs are routinely forced to stand in the sweltering 
desert heat for hours water supplies are inadequate and prisoners 
are sometimes beaten it said 
ketziot inmates made similar complaints when an associated press 
reporter visited the prison in june 
detention in israel of residents of the occupied territories 
violates the fourth geneva convention which states that detainees 
in an occupied country may not be moved to another country the 
report contended 
it quotes lt gen dan shomron the army chief of staff as 
saying ketziots location may be a contradiction of the geneva 
convention but israel has the right to transfer prisoners into a 
sovereign part of the country 
shomron also is quoted as saying the army is trying to improve 
conditions at the prison but its not a hotel 
the lawyers committee for human rights was established in 1978 
and has investigated human rights abuses in more than 25 countries 
this report was written by the executive director michael posner 
and virginia sherry

the main opposition party said tuesday 
it would contest president roh taewoos choice for premier 
the party for peace and democracy led by kim daejung said it 
would oppose national assembly confirmation of kang younghoon 
because roh did not consult the legislature about the appointment 
kims party does not have enough votes to block approval and 
would need the support of other opposition parties 
roh named kang and 19 new ministers monday in a shakeup prompted 
by a political crisis over demands that former president chun 
doohwan rohs predecesor be made to account for human rights 
abuses and corruption during his tenure 
roh said the appointments were among several measures to cut his 
ties with chuns authoritarian regime but critics called the 
changes insufficient a similar reorganizaion is expected in the 
governing democratic justice party 
national assembly hearings into the suppression of a 1980 
uprising in the southern city of kwangju in which hundreds of 
people were killed resumed tuesday with legislators questioning 
witnesses on who was responsible chun and roh were senior generals 
at the time 
officials said privately tuesday the government plans to limit 
the functions of the defense security command to keep the powerful 
military agency out of civilian affairs they said the agency for 
national security planning the governments main intelligence 
organization would be streamlined and barred from political 
surveillance 
past rulers of south korea have used the defense security command 
as a political tool chun was head of the command when he seized 
power in 1980 
kang the designated prime minister paid a courtesy call tuesday 
on kim but the opposition leader said the party already had decided 
to challenge the confirmation 
kims party claimed roh violated the constitution by naming a 
cabinet along with a premier party officials said roh should have 
selected only a premier who in turn would choose a cabinet 
the constitution says a cabinet should be formed after the 
national assembly confirms the premier but naming both at the same 
time has been common in recent years 
chun went into rural exile in a remote buddhist monastery last 
month after apologizing to the nation for abuses while in power he 
left office in february 
roh opposes efforts to punish chun and asked the nation to 
forgive the former president

a woman without ovaries gave birth to a 
baby produced from her egg and her husbands sperm a medical 
advance that offers hope to women who might otherwise be infertile 
doctors said tuesday 
the 6pound 5ounce baby girl laure was born monday in this 
alpine city to a 37yearold woman who asked to be identified only 
as aline to protect her familys privacy 
im so happy i was without hope she told the associated 
press in a telephone interview from her bed at the hopital sud 
french doctors said the birth was the first time a woman without 
ovaries delivered a baby conceived from her own egg 
other women without ovaries have carried babies to term but in 
the past the infant was produced from the egg of a donor alines 
egg was fertilized in a laboratory dish by her husbands sperm the 
resulting embryo was frozen and implanted 10 months later in her 
uterus 
the birth represents a major medical advance because it means 
biological motherhood is still possible for young women who have 
no ovaries or for leukemia patients for example whose ovaries have 
been irrevocably damaged by radiation or chemotherapy dr nicole 
quenard said 
the doctor who attended delivered laure by caesarean section 
called the birth very moving for everyone 
she said the surgical delivery was necessary for reasons not 
related to the conception 
aline first consulted the fertility specialists at hospital sud 
in the spring of 1985 she was in pain and had been unable to 
conceive 
aline had lost an ovary years before to infection and doctors at 
hopital sud discovered she suffered from advanced endometriosis a 
condition in which uterine tissue grows outside the womb 
in alines case the endrometriosis had surrounded her remaining 
ovary when she did not respond to medication doctors decided to 
remove the ovary 
before the ovary was removed doctors extracted four eggs and 
fertilized them with alines husbands sperm four embryos resulted 
and two were implanted in alines uterus no pregnancy resulted 
on dec 14 1987 doctors removed alines remaining ovary and 
fallopian tubes leaving her uterus three months later the 
remaining embryos were implanted in alines uterus and laures 
birth was the result

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev got his 
first look at new york on tuesday during a 40minute motorcade ride 
through the city to the privacy of the soviet mission to the united 
nations a luxury highrise on the posh upper east side of manhattan 
if he carried a surprise proposal as some advisers hinted 
gorbachev kept the secret to himself 
the soviet leader accompanied by his closest foreign policy 
advisers prepared to address the united nations on wednesday and to 
meet with president reagan and presidentelect george bush 
soviet officials were closemouthed about details of gorbachevs 
schedule but hinted he was bringing some surprises on his second 
visit to the united states which comes almost a year to the day 
after the summit meeting in washington at which he and reagan signed 
a treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons 
the soviet leader accompanied by his wife raisa and key 
advisers arrived at john f kennedy international airport and 
stepped from his special aeroflot ilyushin jet precisely on schedule 
at 3 pm after a direct flight from moscow 
in brief remarks at the airport gorbachev said the soviet union 
intends to broaden and expand its cooperation within the united 
nations framework with all the states that make up the united 
nations 
we are living in a world that is going through some very 
crucial changes and we all all nations have their own concerns 
their own interests we shall be sharing our interests in analyzing 
and thinking over the current situation he said 
on the topic of the meeting with reagan and bush the soviet 
leader said we have not arranged any formal agenda so either 
side will be free openly and frankly to raise any questions that it 
wishes to 
the american side however has shown no inclination to try to 
negotiate any complex new agreements as reagan moves off the world 
stage and bush prepares to take over 
gorbachev nonetheless brought along his top foreign policy 
advisers including alexander yakovlev a former ambassador to 
canada and member of the communist partys ruling politburo who 
recently took charge of the international affairs portfolio in the 
party central committee 
yakovlev is among those closest to gorbachev and is regarded as 
an architect of his plan to reallocate soviet resources from defense 
and foreign aid to improving domestic life 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze also accompanied 
the president to new york as did anatoly dobrynin the longtime 
soviet ambassador to the united states who recently retired from his 
central committee post but remains a gorbachev adviser 
gorbachev predicted his meetings in new york will doubtless 
promote greater dialogue and an expansion of cooperation between our 
two countries 
noting that he intends to have a full schedule here before going 
on to havana on friday gorbachev said we will have some other 
meetings with some public and business circles in this country and 
representatives of other countries i trust these will be useful and 
fruitful days we are certainly prepared to make our contribution to 
that end 
soviet officials have predicted for days he would be presenting 
some new ideas during the visit to new york the first leg of a 
nineday trip that also will take him to havana and london before he 
returns to moscow dec 14 but they have provided few details even 
keeping details of his schedule private 
reporters from the united states and other western countries 
searched the halls of the un secretariat building in vain tuesday 
afternoon for soviet officials to answer questions concerning news 
and photographic pools and such questions as whether gorbachev 
planned to give a news conference during his stay in new york 
no soviet spokesman was available in conference room 2 the hall 
the soviets chose for their press briefings and the telephone lines 
were constantly busy at the soviet mission to the united nations 
one official however told reporters at a un news conference 
that gorbachev wants to take as many bites as possible out of the 
big apple 
andrei grachev an official of the communist party central 
committees ideology department said the schedule would be a 
christmas surprise 
new york police said the gorbachevs would visit the observation 
deck of the world trade center the citys tallest building on 
wednesday and would drive past the stock exchange and through the 
broadway area opening a soviet export show viewing european 
paintings at the metropolitan museum of art and visiting central 
park are on the schedule for thursday 
police said mrs gorbachev might also visit a department store

police entered a church 
sanctuary tuesday night and halted a peaceful service dedicated to 
black antiapartheid activists convicted of treason and terrorism 
the rev allan boesak was addressing about 1000 people at the 
central methodist church in downtown johannesburg when more than two 
dozen policemen walked in and canceled the service 
police formed a wall between the pulpit and the audience which 
had turned out in support of the 11 activists convicted last month 
this government does not know justice and does not have a 
vision of peace boesak said before police intervened a 
government that can only depend on the barrel of a gun is not a 
legitimate government 
the rev peter storey minister of the church said police 
declared the service an illegal gathering 
storey led a brief prayer then asked the audience to leave 
quietly and with dignity the multiracial crowd departed without 
incident 
the police said they wanted to talk to me but i told them i 
had nothing to say to them boesak said outside the church 
during a fiery speech that drew repeated applause boesak praised 
the convicted activists as peaceful men and condemned south africas 
justice system 
we now hear that to oppose apartheid is treason to work for 
justice is terrorism boesak said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
organizers of the service originally had planned a rally at a 
nearby university but when police commissioner gen hendrik de witt 
on tuesday banned all protest meetings related to the case 
organizers decided to hold the prayer service 
a hearing began monday in pretoria to determine the sentences for 
the activists who include three senior leaders of the nowbanned 
united democratic front the countrys largest antiapartheid group 
us sens sam nunn dga and david boren dokla attended 
the hearing monday but issued no public statements no hearing was 
held tuesday but it was to resume wednesday 
the trial began in 1985 in the small farming town of delmas and 
later was shifted to pretoria eleven of the orginal 22 defendants 
were acquitted at various stages 
the trial judge kees van dijkhorst ruled that the united 
democratic front was a revolutionary organization which collaborated 
with the outlawed african national congress to incite 
antigovernment violence in 1984 boesak anglican archbishop 
desmong tutu the nobel laureate and other front supporters were 
named as unindicted coconspirators 
the three bestknown defendants in the trial all convicted of 
treason are popo molefe 36 who was the fronts national 
secretary terror lekota 40 its publicity secretary and moses 
chikane 40 secretary of its transvaal province branch 
the maximum penalty for treason and terrorism is death but van 
dijkhorst is expected to impose prison terms when the sentencing 
hearing ends possibly this week 
several of the countrys leading antiapartheid figures testified 
monday on behalf of the defendants 
after the treason verdicts were delivered last month the us 
state department criticized the proceedings saying the defendants 
were convicted of activities that would be accepted in any 
legitimate democracy

murder charges calling for the death penalty 
were filed tuesday against an escaped psychiatric patient accused of 
shooting two guards at universal studios after demanding to see 
actor michael landon 
according to witnesses nathan nicholas trupp 42 apparently had 
delusions that landon star of the highway to heaven television 
series was a nazi 
trupp was charged with firstdegree murder in the slaying of 
jeren beeks and armando torres and one count of attempted murder 
stemming from the shootout he had with sheriffs deputies after the 
slayings trupp was wounded by deputies 
the motive is not robbery said deputy district attorney 
sterling norris who filed the charges it is that he believed 
that he was killing nazis 
norris said trupp believed not only that landon was a nazi but 
also three people authorities say were slain by trupp in an 
albuquerque nm bagel shop on nov 29 
the charges allege a multiple murder special circumstance which 
permits a possible death penalty if trupp is convicted 
tests indicated the 38caliber handgun used in the universal 
studios shootings was the same weapon used in the bagel shop 
killings authorities said 
trupp who had lived off and on in albuquerque since august 1987 
walked away from a supervised boarding house for the mentally ill in 
trenton nj april 5 1987 after being involuntarily committed 
for state psychiatric care 
trupp allegedly shot the universal guards thursday after 
demanding to see or talk by telephone to landon the guards declined 
to let trupp use the telephone in their shack to call landon 
trupp was scheduled for arraignment tuesday afternoon but 
prosecutors said beforehand that trupp was not well enough the 
hearing later was continued to dec 13

affairs officer for sac headquarters at offutt air force base in 
omaha neb

was lifted tuesday evening and that each b52 will have its fuel 
system inspected before being cleared to fly some as early as 
wednesday 
randle had said earlier that she anticipated the fleet would be 
back in the air in 24 hours we dont lose many b52s it has been 
a super plane she said

atlantis streaked out of 
orbit from its secret spy satellite mission tuesday and glided to an 
unusual afternoon landing as a small band of spectators cheered the 
five astronauts safe return 
navy cmdr robert l gibson guided the 97ton shuttle to a 
centerline touchdown at 335 pm pst on a hardpacked clay runway 
after a flight of 4 days 9 hours 5 minutes 
they have been given the welcome back call said billie 
deason at mission control in houston after the spaceship had rolled 
to a halt on the 75milelong runway 
two loud sonic booms crackled overhead as atlantis descended 
through partly sunny skies and made its swooping approach to rogers 
dry lake in the mojave desert 
one tire on the shuttles left landing gear had a slow leak but 
nasa said it was not a concern it certainly did not seem to affect 
the smoothness of the touchdown which was televised live by the 
networks 
about 55 minutes after landing the crew emerged from the orbiter 
and was greeted by nasa adminiistrators and then inspected the 
underside of the craft dings could be seen in the black 
protective tiles ms deason said 
the underside scarring shown by nasa cameras appeared to be a 
lot more damaged than usual said nasa spokeswoman nancy lovato 
a white plume was seen coming from the right rear of atlantis 
during landing but ms lovato said it was normal venting of vapor 
she did not know whether the vapor was water or chemical 
it was a great flight a super flight nasa administrator 
james c fletcher said in a statement it shows we can serve our 
dod department of defense customers as we have in the past 
it was only the seventh afternoon shuttle landing the time 
apparently dictated by the orbit atlantis had to follow in deploying 
a radar satellite to spy on the soviet union nasa prefers morning 
landings at edwards because winds tend to gather force later in the 
day 
because of the military secrecy tuesdays landing was closed to 
public viewing from the observation site on this military base 80 
miles north of los angeles only a few hundred journalists nasa 
employees and invited guests were witnesses 
scattered applause echoed across the hardpan in front of nasas 
main hangar as atlantis rolled across the dry lakebed the national 
anthem blared from a loudspeaker 
in contrast an estimated 425000 people had watched discovery 
return oct 3 from the flight that put americans back in space for 
the first time since the challenger tragedy 
ms deason said all systems performed normally during landing and 
rollout tests of the new nose wheel steering system and brakes 
proved successful she said previous shuttles experienced brake 
problems and before challenger shuttles were steered during landing 
by applying brake pressure on one side of the orbiter or the other 
although nasa and the air force permitted live television 
coverage of the landing as they did for fridays launch from cape 
canaveral fla everything in between was blacked out nothing was 
heard during the flight from commander gibson or crew members col 
richard m mullane lt col guy s gardner and lt col jerry l 
ross of the air force and navy cmdr william m shepherd 
nasa said gibson would probably make brief remarks to the workers 
at edwards before the astronauts flew to houston later in the 
evening 
mission control in houston lifted its curtain of secrecy on the 
flight just long enough to report as it was happening that gibson 
had fired braking rockets to slow the spaceships 17400mph speed 
by 283 mph and drop it out of orbit onto an hourlong fiery descent 
through the atmosphere 
the flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the second since the 
1986 challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts and halted 
launchings for 32 months it was the third flight for atlantis and 
the longest of the three shuttle missions that have been dedicated 
entirely to military purposes 
the national aeronautics and space administration discovered a 
slow leak in one of atlantis six tires before the spaceship was 
launched on monday the space agency issued a statement saying 
the left inboard main landing gear tire pressure is not a concern 
for landing 
rear adm richard truly a former astronaut in charge of the 
shuttle program called the current flight one of our most 
important missions its atlantis first flight after the standdown 
and now you have two vehicles proven in flight thats extremely 
important 
while the mission was shrouded in secrecy with no briefings by 
officials on details of its progress us and soviet news 
organization reported the shuttles classified payload was a 
powerful spy satellite 
sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity said monday that 
the astronauts had successfully deployed the 500 million lacrosse 
satellite during the weekend and that it was operating well in an

sailors past and present history buffs tourists 
and others will gather wednesday to mark the 47th anniversary of the 
suprise japanese attack on pearl harbor that plunged the united 
states into world war ii 
the national park service said it expects 1000 people to mark 
the fateful attack at its public ceremony on the harbors shore and 
another 5000 to attend special programs throughout the day 
obviously this being the 47th year the ceremonies wont be as 
big as for the 50th year said media coordinator dan martinez 
were already planning for that anniversary but every year is 
important there will be survivors here this year that might not 
make it to the 50th 
the us navy planned a private ceremony aboard the uss arizona 
memorial which spans the sunken hull of the uss arizona as a 
tribute to the 1177 men who went down with the ship the arizona 
was one of 21 ships damaged or destroyed in the attack 
the air attack on the pearl harbor naval base and other hawaii 
military installations left about 2400 people dead and 1200 
wounded 
at 755 am hst 1255 pm edt the moment the first bombs 
fell on that sunday morning a moment of silence will be observed 
after which hawaii air national guard jets will fly over in the 
missing man formation 
a navy ship is to pass the memorial and wreaths and flowers will 
be presented as the national anthem and navy hymn are played 
adm david e jeremiah commander in chief of the us pacific

gorbachev arrived in new york on tuesday for informal talks with 
reagan and presidentelect george bush 
on sept 7 in a speech before an american legion gathering in

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev arrived in new 
york on tuesday and said he hoped his luncheon discussions with 
president reagan and presidentelect george bush would lead to an 
expansion of cooperation between the superpowers 
gorbachev made his arrival statement in a sunsplashed ceremony 
at kennedy international airport as us officials said they were 
preparing for the possibility of a grand gesture from the soviet 
leader to reduce troop strength in eastern europe 
gorbachev will blend diplomacy with sightseeing on a threeday 
visit to the united nations and new york he said he hoped his 
meeting with reagan and bush on wednesday would serve the best 
interests of the united states and the soviet union indeed of all 
the world 
we have not arranged any formal agenda so either side will be 
free openly and frankly to raise any issues it wishes to he said 
speaking through an interpreter 
we are living in a world which is going through some very 
crucial changes and we all all nations have their own concerns 
their own interests gorbachev said we shall be sharing our 
concerns and our interests in analyzing and thinking over the 
current situation 
it was gorbachevs second visit to the united states in a year 
and the fifth time he has arranged to sit down with reagan the two 
leaders signed a historic arms reduction treaty during the 
washington summit last year 
for his part bush was playing down his role in wednesdays 
luncheon session he told a news conference in washington he would 
attend in his capacity as vice president and without any of the 
national security aides he has picked for his incoming 
administration 
on resolving the differences between the superpowers bush said 
i will make it clear that we want to go forward but i am not 
going to be pressed into going beyond that prudent approach 
last year gorbachev came to washington this time it was new 
york where some of the biggest headaches were caused by the 
logistics of moving the general secretarys 45car motorcade through 
midtown manhattan 
he will address the un general assembly on wednesday for the 
first time 
arriving on the tide of his drive to shake up the soviet 
political system from top to bottom gorbachev sent advance word 
that he may offer new proposals to end the cold war strengthen the 
united nations and improve the worlds environment 
an american official acknowledged the possibility of a grand 
gesture such as a reduction of soviet troops in czechoslovakia 
hungary and poland it is plausible they would do it on the eve of 
the opening of negotiations with the west and also as a public 
relations move said the official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
such a move in the absence of a similar move by the united 
states would reduce the soviet advantage in conventional forces in 
europe and could facilitate an overal conventional force agreement 
early in the bush administration 
the us official told the associated press that the soviets gave 
no formal notification in advance of gorbachevs visit of a troop 
reduction however the official said it is certainly on our 
list of expectations 
it could be coupled he said with a restructuring of the soviet 
armed forces to make them leaner and meaner putting more men on 
reserve and fewer on active duty 
such a change could ease the burden defense spending is putting 
on the hardpressed soviet economy the effect on the west the 
official said would be neither malign nor benign meaning it 
would be a change taken by the soviets for their own military and 
economic reasons 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact are 
expected to open talks on reducing troops tanks and other 
nonnuclear forces early next year 
a dutch radio station radio netherlands world service reported 
tuesday that gorbachev will offer to cut soviet troop levels by 30 
percent or 140000 soldiers the report said that the soviet 
defense minister gen dmitri yazov had threatened to resign if the 
offer were actually made 
the soviet news agency tass in a dispatch by a diplomatic 
correspondent distributed shortly after gorbachev left moscow said 
the kremlin leader intends to talk about important substantive 
matters concerning real political cooperation between the two 
countries on the broadest range of problems 
as the kremlin leader headed to new york reagan was briefed by 
secretary of state george shultz colin d powell the national 
security adviser and other white house officials 
shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze will 
meet wednesday before the two presidents sit down for lunch 
new york in the throes of the christmas shopping season 
provides an even wider audience for gorbachev and the soviet leader 
plans to do some sightseeing on thursday 
the communist party leaders unabashed purpose is to persuade the 
american business community that perestroika or economic 
reconstruction of the soviet union is wellenough launched to hold 
out the promise of a bigger trade relationship with america 
us officials said the kremlin had notified them in advance that 
apart from the speech gorbachevs main purpose during the visit was 
to persuade reagan to lower american limits on trade and lending 
with communist countries 
the proposals could be implemented by greater access to american 
stock and financial markets as well as fewer limits on the ability 
of organizations such as the exportimport bank and world bank to 
underwrite loans to the soviet union 
asked about this at tuesdays white house briefing presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the soviets have talked about 
loosening trade restrictions in the past and said there has been 
no change in the us position on this issue 
he said that policy is that we support trade with the soviet 
union in commercial areas and support loans for commercial 
nonstrategic uses and have promoted joint ventures and things of 
that sort 
but there are restrictions in a strategic sense he said 
gorbachev in four meetings with reagan has sought to slow the 
nuclear arms race and to ease regional tensions by such moves as 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan vietnamese forces from 
cambodia and cubans from angola 
reagan is seeking a renewed pledge from gorbachev to meet the 
feb 15 deadline for a total soviet pullout from afghanistan the 
soviets announced a suspension last month complaining about attacks 
on the red army by usarmed afghan guerrillas 
last weekend the cuban withdrawal from angola was unsettled by 
an abrupt departure of south africa from negotiations over an 
overall settlement in southwestern africa 
the state department said tuesday there have been significant 
human rights improvements inside the soviet union under gorbachev 
but the department also said those improvements have been uneven 
and marked by reversals and inconsistencies and it said moscow 
remains in violation of the human rights provisions of the helsinki 
accords in part because of its continuing occupation of afghanistan

israeli troops shot and wounded eight arab 
youths including a 5yearold boy and palestinians staged a 
general strike tuesday in solidarity with thousands of prisoners 
jailed during their yearlong uprising 
the army meanwhile said it was opening an investigation into 
the death monday of a 15yearold gaza youth following allegations 
she was shot deliberately at close range by a soldier 
the girl asma abu obadah of the shati refugee camp in gaza 
city was hit in the back of the head with a single plastic bullet 
on her way home from school the army said a patrol commander opened 
fire to disperse a riot but witnesses said the girl was shot at 
close range after she panicked and ran 
we are conducting investigations into the girls death said 
an army official who cannot be further identified under military 
rules we dont have results yet and dont expect anything 
tonight 
the girl was the 319th palestinian to die since the palestinians 
launched their uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories on dec 8 1987 most have been shot in clashes with 
israeli troops eleven israelis also have been killed 
seven palestinians were reported wounded in clashes in the gaza 
strip and one in the west bank 
among the victims in gaza was 5yearold ahmed bahassi who was 
shot in the chest in the deir balah refugee camp doctors said 
doctors at ahli arab hospital in gaza city said he was out of 
danger after the bullet was removed 
the army confirmed that the 5yearold boy was wounded 
in several riots troops were attacked with stones bricks and 
other objects an army spokesman said the commander of an army 
patrol had to fire plastic bullets aiming at the rioters legs in 
order to disperse them 
during the incident no children were seen among the rioters 
the army is checking how and when the boy was injured he said 
two teenagers also were reported wounded by israeli gunfire in 
deir balah and four others were hit in stonethrowing clashes in 
the khan yunis and bureij refugee camps and gaza city 
the army confirmed four casualties in gaza 
in the west bank 13yearold anwar bhati from the village of 
shwakah was shot in the head when villagers threw stones to try to 
block soldiers from entering and searching their homes arab 
reporters said 
bhati was in guarded condition at mukassad hospital in jerusalem 
where he underwent brain surgery dr rustom namari director of the 
hospital said the teenager was hit with a plastic bullet 
we cleaned the wound but we were unable to remove the bullet 
because it was too deep namari said 
an army spokesman confirmed the shwakah wounding and three bullet 
injuries in the gaza strip he said no other details were available 
the army has been using plastic bullets since last august for 
riot control the bullets have drawn criticism from the un relief 
and works agency which oversees aid to palestinian refugees and 
foreign countries including the united states 
plastic bullets are not supposed to be lethal if fired from a 
distance of 70 yards or more but doctors say they can kill if fired 
at close range or if they penetrate the head chest or spine 
the general strike was called to express solidarity with the 
5600 palestinians in israeli jails it was the first of three 
called this week by underground leaders of the palestinian uprising 
shutdowns thursday and friday are to mark the end of one year of 
palestinian revolt 
businesses were closed in most of the west bank and gaza and 
public transportation halted a jewish man was hospitalized after a 
car he was driving was stoned near bethlehem 
in nablus dozens of palestinians were treated monday and tuesday 
for injuries from rubber bullets or beatings the bullets actually 
rubbercovered metal pellets generally do not penetrate the skin 
but can cause bruising and broken bones 
also on tuesday police in haifa said they uncovered a 10member 
squad of israeli arabs responsible for a grenade attack in the 
coastal city last august in which 25 people were injured 
two of those arrested were bedouin soldiers in the israeli army 
and police said they suspect the squad planned to kidnap and kill 
other soldiers bedouins and druse are the only arabs allowed to 
serve in israels army

wholly comfortable with the honorable character of the way 
heritage usa was operated under his leadership and will plead 
innocent to fraud charges his attorney said tuesday

diverting more than 4 million in ptl money to their own use each 
was charged with eight counts of mail fraud 15 counts of wire 
fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud 
a second 11count indictment charged david taggart bakkers 
former personal aide and taggarts brother james with evading 
nearly 500000 in income taxes and diverting about 11 million of 
ptl funds for personal expenses 
bakkers wife tammy was not indicted 
although bakker himself remained silent tuesday on the charges 
his attorney jim toms said the former tv evangelist planned to 
preach sunday at his new church in a converted roller rink 
toms said his client would plead innocent to all of the charges 
in the 24count indictment the indictment said bakker 48 and 
dortch 57 engaged in a conspiracy designed to create and 
continue lavish and extravagant lifestyles by defrauding 
supporters who bought lifetime partnerships at ptls heritage usa 
complex 
the maximum penalty for each count is five years in prison and a 
250000 fine which means bakker faces a possible sentence of 120 
years in prison and 6 million in fines bakker and the other 
defendants are scheduled to appear in court dec 15

charlotte late tuesday afternoon to pick up summonses ordering them

with him last night toms said in an interview from his 
hendersonville nc office its going to take time now for him 
just to study whats there and decide how we go about dealing with 
it

circumstances 
id say he was relieved to see the specifics so he has a 
problem he can start working on he said his faith in his 
christian vocation is unshaken and he is determained to do what he 
needs to do to work his way through this 
bakker has indicated he is wholly comfortable with the 
honorable character of the way heritage usa was operated under his 
leadership and desires to see its ministry restored and continue 
the attorney said 
bakker who began the ministry in 1972 left it in disgrace in 
march 1987 after admitting to a sexual encounter with church 
secretary jessica hahn eight years earlier 
after failing to regain control of ptl in bankruptcy proceedings 
several months ago the bakker moved his newly formed jim amp tammy 
ministries to a leased brick colonial building on the yager estate

president reagan has lifted a sixyear ban on 
us export of cluster bombs to israel on the understanding that the 
weapons will not be used against civilian targets the state 
department said tuesday 
reagan banned the sale of such munitions to israel after that 
country used them against civilian target areas in lebanon in 
violation of israeli assurances to the united states it was 
announced at the time 
following a recently concluded understanding on the use of 
cluster munitions the president has determined that the ban on 
their sale is no longer warranted state department press officer 
anita stockman said tuesday 
now that the issue of usage has been resolved pursuant to the 
terms of the recent understanding barring use against civilians 
we see no reason to prohibit israels access to these weapons 
which can contribute to israels security ms stockman added 
she noted that the united states sells to many other countries a 
variety of cluster bombs and shells which produce multiple 
explosions and fragments on impact 
reagans decision was denounced by ambassador clovis maksoud the 
league of arab nations representative in the united states who 
called it shocking very provocative and sickening 
maksoud said many maimed lebanese and palestinians bear witness 
to israels reckless use of these weapons during the invasion of 
lebanon and israels repeated raids on lebanese soil 
maksoud added that the decision coming after us refusal of an 
entry visa for palestine liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
to speak at the un general assembly prompts people to wonder if 
this latest provocation is a deliberate attempt to strain arab 
patience to the breaking point or is this sickening decision a 
further departing vindictive shot against the arab world and another 
gift to israeli rejectionists from the present administration 
maksoud asked 
he added that regardless of such us acts the palestinians 
commitment to reconciliation will stay the course charted last 
month in the palestine national council declaration at algiers 
a new yorkbased arab group the americanarab relations 
committee of the national council on islamic affairs also denounced 
the move 
committee president mt mehdi said the decision will strengthen 
arab conviction that the united states is a permanent ally of 
israel and a permanent enemy of the arab people 
he said that the arabs cannot trust that israel will not use 
these bombs again

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in his 
united nations address wednesday may announce a decision by the 
ruling politburo to make unilateral cuts in conventional forces 
stationed in eastern europe and along the chinese border according 
to a published report 
the washington post in its wednesday editions quoted 
unidentified soviet sources saying the politburo approved the troop 
cut following a shakeup in the ruling body sept 30 
announcement of major cuts in the soviet armed forces would add 
drama to gorbachevs new york visit but not come as a big surprise 
to us officials 
gorbachev who arrived in new york on tuesday was scheduled to 
address the un general assembly on wednesday at 11 am and then 
eat lunch with president reagan and presidentelect george bush 
us officials have been predicting for a year that gorbachev 
would sharply cut the soviet armed forces and many intelligence 
analysts thought the announcement would come at the summit in moscow 
last summer 
such an announcement likely would give new momentum to 
longstalled talks on reducing warsaw pact and nato conventional 
forces in central europe and to improve the atmosphere for a summit 
scheduled next spring between gorbachev and chinese leader deng 
xiaopeng china has cut its own ground forces by one million over 
the past four years leaving it with about 4 million 
the soviet armed forces according to us government estimates 
number approximately 56 million 
the post quoted soviet sources estimating the cuts at 20 percent 
such a reduction would parallel cuts ordered in the mid1950s by 
thensoviet leader nikita khrushchev over protests from the armed 
forces 
many soviet generals are thought to oppose the cuts which 
gorbachev and his allies have hinted at in a new doctrine of 
reasonable sufficiency such a doctrine would be based on 
ability to repel aggression rather than to mount a massive offensive 
the soviet chief of staff marshal sergei akhromeyev said during 
a visit to the pentagon last july that he opposed any cut in soviet 
forces without a corresponding reduction in the conventional armies 
kept in western europe by the united states and its allies in the 
north atlantic treaty organization 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and other senior american 
officials have said they would welcome such a change but have seen 
no indication of it in the deployment of soviet forces

the military chaplain walks a fine line 
upholding religious principles of trust peace and kindness in 
organizations geared for the rigors of war 
but leaders of these ministers in uniform say their work is 
neither inconsistent nor compromised and religious ideals are all 
the more important on a front of danger to them 
cooperation without compromise reads the army chaplains 
motto 
we do ministry without compromise and without apology says 
gen stuart a barstad retiring this month after three years as air 
force chief of chaplains 
peace movements should not think they have a corner on the 
market he adds they are not the only ones interested in 
peace 
barstad and three other top us military chaplains commented on 
their roles in recent interviews with the lutheran monthly magazine 
of the evangelical lutheran church in america 
remarkably all of them are clergyman of that denomination as is 
the nations fifth top military chaplain army col herbert b 
cleveland director of chaplain services for the veterans 
administration 
altogether they oversee work of about 13000 military chaplains 
and assistants of various faiths serving families of nearly 3 
million members of the army navy marine corps air force and 
national guard besides veterans 
the chaplaincy chiefs say theyre carrying out full undiluted 
ministry in an environment that keenly needs it 
the military has never asked me to hold back on my ministry or 
my preaching says barstad originally from colfax wis 
maj gen norris einertson army chief of chaplains calls it a 
ministry of presence 
my parishioners army personnel are contributing to peace in a 
troubled world he says the militarys first function is to 
keep the peace not make war 
einertson originally of westbrook minn adds we are always 
faced with alternatives we are not being christian if we allow the 
rights of any to be trampled on by oppressors of the left or right 
he says american churches are not teaching christians to think 
critically about war and peace resulting in their either approving 
armed conflict indiscriminately or rejecting it as always wrong 
rear adm alvin b koeneman navy chief of chaplains concedes 
the work involves some tensions but these must be seen in light of 
what christianity says about the sinful nature of societies as well 
as about peace 
its tough to talk about the peace of jesus while working on an 
ammunition ship he says but sailors live in that situation 
someone needs to be there to live the contradiction with them and 
wrestle with it 
koeneman originally from omro wis points out that unlike 
hospital or prison chaplains who go home at night in the military 
you eat the same food as the personnel and live with them 
if theyre stuck in the mud youre in the mud he says if 
theyre getting shot at youre getting shot at its one thing to 
talk with a sailor about being lonely but another when youre both 
a long way from home 
col walter hiskett marine chief of chaplains was a wounded 
combat veteran of the korean war before entering the ministry and 
then volunteering for his first tour of duty as a chaplain in 
vietnam 
for that he calls himself dumbdumb but adds these 
people deserve ministry the thought of no chaplaincy no ministry 
to these people was unconscionable 
the chiefs point out that they advise command staffs on matters 
of morale as well as religion and morals thus exerting an influence 
on military policy 
they make an impact on the institution says barstad the 
military is part of our national structure we must ask do we want 
to be represented there and how best can we minister as insiders 
or outsiders 
says koeneman you can make a far more profound witness for 
peace working within the system than you can carrying a placard or 
throwing goats blood on some naval installation 
the chaplaincy chiefs say they often have presented church social 
statements on peace and war to military leaders in the pentagon 
they want to know what the churches are saying einertson 
said 
adds barstad the military is a very religious community the 
institution recognizes that the faith dimension is a crucial part of 
life there are many people here who are concerned about their 
faith 
einertson referring to the chaplaincys ecumenical setting among 
those of various faiths or none says the military stretched a 
pastor more than any other environment 
koeneman observes its not all brass bands and flags there 
have been times when i was depressed and wondered whats a nice 
guy like me doing here but i knew it was there to bring them a 
word from the lord

manufacturing productivity is still on the rise but a new survey 
finds the the nations business economists growing pessimistic about 
the economys fate in 1989 
the labor department said monday that productivity in the 
manufacturing sector improved at an annual rate of 52 percent in 
the third quarter a 72 percent jump in annual output was 
accompanied by only a 18 percent jump in employment and overtime to 
accomplish it 
businesses as a whole did not fare as well productivity among 
nonfarm businesses including the service sector that now accounts 
for about half of the nations economic activity improved by just 
19 percent on 34 percent higher output and a 15 percent rise in 
hours worked 
its pretty puny said michael evans who runs an economic 
forecasting firm in washington the ability to raise our standard 
of living is hardly improving at all thats the real effect of the 
budget deficits and these leveraged buyouts of corporations 
were spending all these billions on interest payments instead 
of capital improvements research and development and 
infrastructure he said 
still the 19 percent improvement in efficiency was better than 
the 13 percent estimated earlier before the government last week 
revised the nations gross national product upward for the third 
quarter it also nearly offset a 24 percent decline in productivity 
in the second quarter 
but the survey of 200 members of the national association of 
business economists predicted higher prices and interest rates next 
year 
an overwhelming majority of the economists 88 percent predicted 
presidentelect george bush would have to deal with a recession in 
his first two years in office 40 percent forecast the country would 
be in a downturn by this time next year 
the group predicted that the overall economy as measured by the 
gross national product would grow 22 percent next year far below 
the 35 percent forecast by the administration 
the group said consumer prices which have been rising at a 46 
percent annual rate this year would climb by 5 percent in 1989 and 
interest rates would also continue upward

a prechristmas settlement of drexel burnham 
lambert incs legal travails is possible because the wall street 
firm is facing increased pressure to bargain with federal 
prosecutors and its resolve to fight criminal charges is weakening 
sources familiar with the case say 
the prospect of crippling fines a hostile judge an impending 
rackeetering indictment enormous legal fees and a potential flood 
of civil lawsuits have combined to make drexel rethink its position 
they said monday 
according to one of the sources who all spoke on condition they 
not be identified a possible plea agreement or an indictment could 
come before christmas following final negotiations between drexel 
attorneys and representatives of the manhattan us attorneys 
office 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined comment on the firms 
strategy us attorneys office officials also declined comment on 
the drexel case in accordance with their policy of silence 
regarding pending investigations 
a settlement of the biggest securities fraud investigation 
arising from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal would mark a 
stunning reversal for drexel the scrappy wall street powerhouse 
that vowed to triumph over accusations it conspired with boesky 
manipulated stock and cheated clients 
even with the threat of major criminal charges hanging overhead 
drexel has continued to dominate in the lucrative business it almost 
singlehandedly created the 175 billion highyield highrisk 
junk bond market 
that fact was dramatically illustrated last week when a buyout 
team backed by drexel won a record bidding contest for rjr nabisco 
inc for nearly 25 billion drexel will earn tens of millions of 
dollars in fees by helping place 5 billion in junk bonds crucial to 
financing that deal 
nonetheless drexels senior management seemed more preoccupied 
with the firms legal troubles last week and suggested privately to 
the staff in blunt terms that a settlement was possible and even 
preferable 
if we settle we can put this constant attack on the firm 
behind us drexel chief executive frederick joseph said in a 
memorandum to the firms 10000 employees outlining how he saw the 
immediate future possibly unfolding 
joseph told employees that talks with us attorney rudolph w 
giuliani are now reaching a crucial stage if we do not agree to 
settle with the us attorney we believe that he intends to indict 
the firm as well as certain of our employees and to include in 
such an indictment socalled racketeering charges rico 
indictment under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt 
organizations law originally intended to combat drug pushers and 
pimps would taint drexel as an allegedly criminal enterprise tie 
up much of the firms assets and impair its ability to conduct 
normal business 
conviction could bring crippling fines 
moreover a racketeering conviction would expose drexel to 
potentially hundreds of private lawsuits by investors who claim they 
were victimized for which the firm would risk paying triple damages 
even if drexel believes it can beat the racketeering charges 
attorneys familiar with the case said they think the firm is 
reassessing that approach because of the adverse publicity such 
charges would create 
compounding drexels concern is the prospect that the government 
may have found other witnesses to testify against the firm besides 
boesky the notorious speculator who turned states evidence after 
settling insider trading charges two years ago by paying a record 
100 million in penalties 
up until recently drexel lawyers had been saying confidently 
that the crux of the governments investigation hinged on the words 
of boesky a doublecrosser and admitted liar now serving a 
threeyear federal prison term 
in addition drexel may fear the wrath of a federal judge likely 
to play a major role in any criminal case milton pollack who has 
been presiding over much of the boeskyrelated civil litigation to 
date and is known for his progovernment leanings in whitecollar 
frauds 
drexel has been fighting unsucessfully to have pollack 
disqualified from hearing the civil fraud case against the firm 
brought by the securities and exchange commission three months ago 
so far that effort seems only to have made the judge more hostile 
to drexels position

wall streets initial response was favorable to 
plans by four major companies to offer their shareholders a chance 
to exchange more than 5 billion in stock for a new type of security 
that could be traded whole or broken into three parts 
the financial services giant american express co consumer 
products and foodmaker sara lee corp health care products provider 
pfizer inc and chemicals giant dow chemical co filed documents 
monday with the securities and exchange commission in which they 
outlined plans to exchange up to 20 percent of their stock the 
proposed exchanges are expected to begin in midjanuary 
shareholders who chose to do so would trade a common share for a 
new security called an unbundled stock unit that would consist 
of a 30year bond preferred stock and a stock appreciation 
certificate 
in trading on the new york stock exchange american express edged 
up 62 cents a share to 2750 dow chemical rose 2 to 8612 
pfizer rose 187 to 58 and sara lee added 87 cents a share to 
4537 
one of the nations top ratings services moodys investors 
service said monday that it confirmed its debt ratings for american 
express after reviewing its proposal for unbundled stock units 
moodys said that although the issuance of the units would 
decrease american expresss financial flexibility it would not 
weaken its economic fundamentals to a level that would be 
inconsistent with its current ratings 
the proposal was described as giving highquality us companies 
a serious alternative to the heavy borrowing usually associated 
with stock buybacks that have forced other companies to sell off 
major assets watch their debt ratings fall and cut spending on 
items such as research 
the plans developer ron gallatin of shearson lehman hutton 
inc cautioned that the new security was neither a takeover 
defense nor a takeover deterrent and said he would not like to see 
it used by other than topquality concerns 
investors are expected to be attracted to features of the new 
security that would have the same effect as prohibiting a reduction 
in dividend and guaranteeing a certain minimum appreciation 
regardless of the stock price 
government regulators have to review the proposal to ensure it 
complies with securities laws 
the proposal comes at a time when corporate chiefs are under 
increasing pressure to increase their stock prices or risk becoming 
a target in the recordsmashing run of takeovers it also comes as 
investment firms are trying to lure individual investors back to the 
market 
under the plan 
the bond would carry an interest coupon equivalent to the 
current dividend rate of the stock and would mature at a premium to 
the current stock price 
the preferred stock would entitle the holder to any increases in 
dividend payments compared with the current dividend over the next 
30 years 
the stock appreciation certificate would entitle the holder to 
any capital gain on the stock in 30 years that exceeds the premium 
allotted to the bondholder 
it is expected that the entire unit each of its parts and a 
combination of the preferred stock and stock appreciation 
certificate would be traded separately on the new york stock 
exchange 
new yorkbased american express proposed exchanging up to 60 
million of its common shares or about 144 percent of its stock 
that stake was valued at 16 billion at the end of last week 
dow chemical based in midland mich proposed to exchange up to 
12 million of its shares or about 65 percent worth about 12 
billion at the end of last week 
sara lee which has its headquarters in chicago said it would 
exchange up to 22 million shares or about 20 percent worth about 
987 million at the end of last week 
pfizer based in new york would exchange up to 33 million 
shares or 20 percent worth about 18 billion

us steel import quotas have outlived their 
purpose but because american producers likely will win extended 
protection the restraints should be made less burdensome to 
steelusing manufacturers say steel traders and a former us trade 
official 
advocates of an efficient economy are set to lose one more 
battle to champions of protection said gary hufbauer georgetown 
university professor of financial diplomacy and former deputy 
assistant us treasury secretary for trade and investment policy 
presidentelect george bush in a letter written late in the 
presidential campaign offered to renew the 5year voluntary 
restraint agreements instituted by president reagan 
bushs offer came at a time when economic factors say enough is 
enough domestic steel mills are running at 90 percent of capacity 
the industry should earn 2 billion in 1988 and many steel products 
are scarce hufbauer said in a speech monday night to members of 
the american institute for imported steel 
earlier monday aiis officials said that if the vras must be 
extended past their september expiration they should be modified to 
prevent a repeat of the steel shortages and sharp price increases 
that occurred with some products within the last two years 
were trying to be realistic newly elected aiis president 
john griffin said following a monday morning news conference 
the more than 30 product quotas prevented foreign producers from 
shipping additional steel plate for factory floors and bridge decks 
for example when us producers could not meet demand he said 
weve seen projects where they leave holes in the deck because 
you cant get plate said griffin who is also president of the 
houston steel trader maurice pincoffs co 
domestic steel companies contend they still need protection as 
the us industry restructures and they deny that natural market 
forces not the vras caused modest price increases and temporary 
tightness not shortages for some products 
the vras have cost us steel users 7 billion annually in higher 
material costs and lost business due to shortages hufbauer said 
steel users have paid their dues for many years he said 
referring to steel trade restraints employed in various forms since 
the late 1960s 
the industry has been insulated from imports for so long that 
it has become thoroughly addicted hufbauer said 
the us companies say only a renewal of the quotas will check 
predatory trade practices and allow time to continue the turnaround 
that has brought the domestic industry profits of 325 billion in 
the last seven quarters after losses of 12 billion over the 
preceding five years they accuse foreign producers of selling their 
metal at prices set below production costs and of underwriting 
operations with government grants 
the fundamental problem in the steel industry has never been 
unfair practices abroad hufbauer said the fundamental problem 
was that the us industry became in the 1970s woefully 
uncompetitive by comparison with efficient foreign producers the 
industry was overstaffed and its technology was outmoded 
he said that during tough times us producers use the same 
pricing strategies they condemn in their foreign competitors 
if us steel producers were put to the test of us trade 
laws most would be found guilty during bad times of unfair trade 
practices right within the american market hufbauer said 
nonetheless modified vras are preferable to the expense and 
uncertainty of massive trade lawsuits from the us industry said 
the new yorkbased importers association the texas association of 
steel importers and the west coast metal importers association 
fred lamesch a past president of the importers association 
said none of the top steelexporting nations have granted any steel 
production subsidies for several years the only subsidies still 
available to european producers are those that help pay employee 
benefits when plants close he said 
the french say america has the biggest subsidy by being able to 
give pink slips to workers on friday and say dont come back on 
monday said hans mueller an economics professor at middle 
tennessee state university who is a consultant for the importers 
group 
most of the subsidies are optical illusions mueller said 
we see subsidies in anything different than what we do 
us steel users already are complaining that the domestic steel 
industry seems too prosperous to be demanding further trade 
protection 
those demanding changes or abandonment of the quotas include the 
precision metal forming association the steel service center 
institute the forging industry association and heavy equipment 
manufacturers caterpillar inc and deere amp co

a strongerthanexpected showing by general motors 
corp pushed late november sales of usmade cars and light trucks 
up 36 percent this year compared with last year 
us automakers said monday they sold 326744 vehicles during the 
nov 2130 period compared with 275929 the same time last year 
but sales of imported cars and light trucks fell 101 percent to 
282631 late last month compared with 301715 last year 
percentages are based on daily sales rates rather than straight 
comparisons of 1988 and 1987 figures there were eight selling days 
during the late november period this year and seven last year 
gm paced us automakers with a 17 percent rise in its late 
november car sales going to 103137 this year from 77118 during 
the period last year ford motor cos car sales fell 187 percent 
to 51424 during late november from 55374 last year 
chrysler corps car sales slipped 36 percent in late november 
based on a daily selling rate going to 26863 compared with 24372 
last year 
the increase at gm and the decline at ford came in part because 
of sales patterns during late november last year 
they sales were stronger than i expected in late november 
only because of a surge in sales by gm said analyst david healy 
of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
gm a year ago had an unusually low market share so the 17 
percent increase in their selling rate was helped by a unusually 
large market share this year and an unusually small one last year 
healy said 
this period last year was very weak for gm agreed analyst 
jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san francisco and 
this time was when people were making a lot of hay about ford taking 
market share from gm 
these kind of numbers are not too surprising i dont think 
this means that gm is the hot manufacturer this year and ford is 
not 
for the month gms car sales rose 141 percent compared with 
fords decline of 05 percent and chryslers 12 percent increase 
among the imports trucks showed a 198 percent decrease in sales 
during the month and sales of cars fell 79 percent 
perhaps one of the real interesting things is that imports are 
down so much garretty said adding that the monetary exchange 
rate and a shift of some manufacturing to the united states by 
japanese companies were among the reasons for the depressed sales 
figures 
there is a price effect and the other thing is that in this 
model year there isnt a whole lot that is riproaringly new among 
imports out there she added imports probably will continue to 
stay down

japans economy grew at an annual rate of 93 
percent in the julyseptember quarter due to strength in private 
investment and exports the government reported tuesday 
the economic planning agency said the brisk growth in the gross 
national product during the second fiscal quarter represents a 
significant rebound of the countrys economy from an annualized 
39percent fall in gnp the previous quarter 
that decline had reflected sluggish external demand and sagging 
housing investment 
the unexpectedly high growth in exports however is raising 
concern the direction of the countrys economy may be turing once 
again to a more exportdependent structure said government 
officials requesting anonymity 
the government had set a preliminary target of gnp growth at 38 
percent for fiscal 1988 ending next march most economists 
anticipated the growth of adjusted gnp will remain at between 6 
percent and 8 percent for the third quarter 
the annual rate of 93 percent which translates into an adjusted 
growth of 22 percent from the apriljune quarter suggests the 
governments growth target is well within reach the officials said 
officials said brisk personal spending capital equipment and 
housing investment spurred the brisk domestic demand 
the domestic category is taking good form they are hard 
figures said an epa official 
a strong 15percent increase in quartertoquarter exports 
compared to a 07percent decline in the last quarter led to 
04percent increase in external demand the officials said 
meanwhile quartertoquarter imports declined by 11 percent 
from the apriljune period largely due to the higher value of the 
yen against the dollar 
epa officials said the unexpectely higher third quarter figures 
seemed to be in part a reaction to the negative growth of the 
previous quarter but the nations economic growth recovered to a 
stable stage 
a renewed increase in exports reflected worldwide economic 
expansion supported by robust privatesector capital spending 
centering on the united states western europe and asian developing 
countries kyodo news service quoted a senior agency official as 
saying 
takashi saito general managing director of fuji banks research 
division described the annualized growth figure as a little 
stronger than expected 
he said the figure confirms japans business conditions are 
continuing to expand in the wake of contractions recorded in the 
previous quarter 
we feared a downturn in economic liveliness based on the last 
quarterly numbers he said 
he also said the growth in exports raised concerns about the 
direction of currency rates and us efforts to reduce its trade 
deficit with japan

grain and soybean futures were mixed in early 
trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting new optimism 
about wheat exports and continuing concerns about the south american 
soybean weather 
after a lower opening across the board wheat prices turned 
higher while corn oats and soybeans firmed slightly to trade near 
mondays settlement prices 
the agriculture department said in a report issued late monday 
wheat export inspections last week totaled 289 million bushels 
considerably more than the 20 million to 24 million bushels the 
trade had expected 
pressure on soybean prices stemmed from reports of rain in the 
soybeangrowing region of argentina and forecasts for rain in 
brazil where soybean planting also is under way 
but walter spilka an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp 
co in new york said the weather forecasts were sketchy and soybean 
trading activity was light 
the markets really just treading water he said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 415 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cent higher with december at 252 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to cent higher with march at 204 a bushel

rusty jones inc has filed for protection from 
creditors in us bankruptcy court saying its carrustproofing 
business had deteriorated as us automakers extended their own 
rustthrough warranties 
the filing monday under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code 
seeks time for the beleaguered chicagobased company to reorganize 
rusty jones warranty program remains in effect for cars 
initially treated before aug 1 but claims brought by car owners 
will become part of the bankruptcy proceedings said president 
charles wortman 
claims by auto owners could reach 25 million wortman said 
since 1985 rusty jones has seen its distribution network dwindle 
from 3000 newcar dealerships in the northeast midwest and florida 
to about 1800 wortman said in a telephone interview 
rusty jones is a rustproofing product sold by newcar dealers 
the company guarantees treated cars against rust perforation for as 
long as the original buyer owns the car 
it ran into trouble basically when the major car 
manufacturers went ahead and extended the rust protection they 
offered consumers to 6year 60000 miles 7year 70000 miles 
some even have 100000mile warranties wortman said 
the extended manufacturer warranties discouraged consumers from 
purchasing additional rust protection wortman said and if he 
didnt buy the rust protection he wouldnt buy the rusty jones 
gloss protection or fabric protection 
rusty jones announced on aug 1 it would no longer offer 
warranties with its rustproofing product last week the company 
laid off about 90 employees which represented nearly its entire 
workforce 
in our view the companys viability can only be restored by a 
complete reorganization in a chapter 11 proceeding wortman said 
our goal is to preserve the value of the company and to protect 
the interests of claimants and potential claimants 
wortman is a shareholder in rustco inc which purchased rusty 
jones on nov 23 from bci consumer products corp and michael mater 
former president of rusty jones rustcos other shareholder is 
renaissance holdings inc a subsidiary of renaissance capital ltd 
which is headed by bankruptcy specialist alexander knopfler

in the age of megabuck mergers and massive 
debt restructurings kelly services inc thinks theres something to 
be said for a healthy bottom line 
while the 6yearold economic recovery has produced a boom in 
temporary services kelly has stuck with a lowkey fiscally 
conservative style achieving record sales and earnings all three 
quarters this year 
conservatism makes kelly stand out a little bit said sam 
sacco executive vice president of the national association of 
temporary services a trade association 
the industry is filled with entrepreneurs and risk takers 
sacco said kellys developed more on a careful wellplotted 
basis 
that conservative strategy has made the company a world leader in 
temp services with more than 550000 temporary and 3800 fulltime 
employees on the global payroll 
net earnings for the third quarter this year jumped 19 percent 
from the same period in 1987 to 183 million that came on sales 
of 336 million an 11 percent increase from the yearago period 
the company reported 1987 earnings of 505 million on sales of 
116 billion 
but despite its obvious success kellys growth is actually 
moderating compared with other major players in the temp industry 
the industry has grown 18 percent to 20 percent each of the last 
two years said industry analyst jerry levine of merrill lynch amp co 
in new york kellys revenues by comparison have increased about 
13 percent a year during that period 
as in other industries acquisitions are fueling much of the 
growth among kellys competitors 
manpower inc which posted net earnings of 311 million on 25 
billion in sales in 1987 was acquired in september 1987 by blue 
arrow plc a londonbased temporary services company 
other national temporary service companies such as adia 
personnel services inc and the olsten corp have been expanding 
through acquisitions 
not kelly the acquisition of four small companies in australia 
to establish kelly branches there this year was a first according 
to terence e adderly kellys president and chief executive officer 
kelly also has branches in canada puerto rico england ireland 
scotland wales and france 
the companys growth has been driven by the basic laws of supply 
and demand 
strong growth in the economy during the long expansion has 
boosted demand for temps and allowed kelly to raise rates at a 
faster pace than its payroll costs are increasing a recent analysis 
in the value line investment survey said 
cost containment measures also have helped by keeping operating 
costs from growing as fast as sales 
their financial strength is the strongest in the industry 
said analyst levine of merrill lynch they have an almost 
unbelievable amount of cash its a most liquid company with cash 
flow 
kellys 1987 annual report showed assets of 232 million 684 
million of that cash and liabilities of 776 million 
value line said the companys financial muscle could easily 
support a largescale acquisition a steppedup expansion program or 
a share repurchase program 
but the company wont disclose its plans for all its capital 
william russell kelly an industry pioneer who founded the business 
in 1946 is chairman of the board and also owner of 80 percent of 
the controlling stock 
a slowdown in new job creation may be biggest threat to kellys 
future growth value line said the company is likely to achieve 13 
percent growth this year but weaker economic conditions could cut 
the rate to 10 percent in 1989 
kelly is fighting back with aggressive training and recruiting 
programs 
in the office clerical area the company believes it has been at 
the forefront in adapting to changes brought about by office 
automation 
weve trained over 1 million people in the last 10 years on 
word processing and are currently training 250000 people a year 
adderly said of the free service 
we had to take on a training role because of the amount of 
people needed to fill jobs said p jeffrey sheak regional 
manager in the detroit area we havent been able to recruit them 
all 
in addition to job fairs and visits to universities and shopping 
malls kelly is recruiting older people in an effort to expand the 
labor pool with experienced former workers 
the companys encore program launched last year targets workers 
age 55 and older and the age group now comprises 10 percent of 
kellys temporary work force compared with 7 percent to 8 percent 
in 1987 
kellys greatest asset of all may be its name recognition though 
company officials say they think the term kelly girl is 
outdated it still appears in newspaper classified ads 
theyre like kleenex of the tissue business the name is 
synonymous with temporary help sacco said

illinois power co has agreed to pay 
115 million to a couple critically injured in a naturalgas 
explosion in their home two years ago 
in a settlement reached monday the utility company agreed to pay 
jerry sickmeier 33 and lisa jines 26 10 million in damages and 
15 million for medical expenses said the couples attorney ce 
heiligenstein 
both sustained burns on over 80 percent of their bodies in the 
dec 7 1986 explosion at their home in cahokia a st louis 
suburb they now live in nearby belleville 
the settlement was reached on the day a trial in the case was 
scheduled to begin 
they are much relieved that this financial ordeal is over with 
and that they can have some lifetime financial security 
heiligenstein said both suffered severe burns and have severe 
limitations in the limbs 
heiligenstein said neither has worked since the explosion 
illinois power spokeswoman barbara lillyman said the utility had 
no comment on the settlement 
the couple alleged that illinois power was negligent when it 
allowed a naturalgas pipe to deteriorate to the point that it 
ruptured gas from the pipe traveled through sewer lines into the 
homes utility room and was ignited by the pilot light of a 
hotwater heater they said the explosion occurred as police were 
awakening area residents and telling them to evacuate 
sickmeier was treated for seven months at massachusetts general 
hospital in boston for thirddegree burns that covered most of his 
body he also suffered burns in his lungs and spent more than two 
months on a respirator

satellite photos that can tell a farmer a 
sprinkler head needs fixing or a field needs spraying may seem 
pretty far out but such spaceage technology is available and is 
expected to grow 
robert w smith a consultant in lodi calif says satellite 
technology is just beginning to break loose from government 
stranglehold and become more widely available 
particularly in the agricultural industry information needs to 
be more accessible he said 
during a recent trade show of farm equipment in fresno smith 
displayed some infrared photos taken from high above the fertile 
fields of central california 
the satellite photos were colorcoded sort of like 
electionnight television maps red spots in the photos showed the 
crops on the ground were healthy smith explained in an interview 
if we see a blemish in the red photo it tells us there is some 
kind of stress he said that might be good like irrigation 
which is a stress factor another blemish may show disease 
a photo can cover an area as large as 100 miles by 110 miles so 
the spot that has a potential problem must be magnified technicians 
can get the resolution down to one acre but usually magnify down to 
a 10acre plot smith said 
satellite photos can save money by helping farmers determine more 
precisely when and where to irrigate fertilize or spray for pests 
if you own a large amount of acreage it isnt always necessary 
to spray you dont always need all those nutrients said smith 
the use of satellite photos on the farm is still quite limited 
across the country because of the cost and complexity of the tool 
those familiar with the technology say two companies provide raw 
data from satellites orbiting the earth eosat an american firm 
based in lanham md and spot a french consortium operating from 
reston va 
the data is available in photographic form or in digital form on 
computer tape 
a single photograph or batch of tape from one of the major 
satellite services will cover a huge area and cost anywhere from 
1600 to 3800 and a farmer will also need someone to interpret 
the data for him which will increase the cost 
a slightly more costefficient service is provided by a limited 
number of smaller firms such as senstar inc of fresno which can 
shoot similar type photographs using specially equipped cameras 
mounted on aircraft 
norris packer of senstar says he uses digital cameras fitted with 
infrared and thermal sensors to shoot photographs for west coast 
farmers he also helps farmers interpret the data but he said the 
cost of 115 an acre really only makes sense for big operators of 
1000 acres or more 
the smaller farmer gets out and walks his fields every day 
anyway packer reasoned 
he claims bigger farmers might benefit from satellite photography 
because it lets them solve problems before they start to cost 
money 
oregon farmer frank lamb for example uses satellite photographs 
to keep track of 10000 acres of potatoes alfalfa and other crops 
in hermiston ore he has even gone into the business of providing 
the technology to his neighbors 
recently a photograph spotted a blemish in one of lambs fields 
which turned out to be a broken spigot the photo also warned that 
nematodes had infested another sector according to smith 
smith said the farmer estimated it would have taken his employees 
up to three weeks to find those problems which could have been 
costly 
smallscale farmers can take part in this spaceage technology 
through cooperatives or such organizations as the california farm 
bureau smith said 
packer said a tomato grower might need three photos during a 
sixweek period to find out which fields are ripe enough to pick 
his company plans an experiment over california citrus groves 
this winter to focus on frost damage and figures two pictures might 
be needed for that crop in a season 
one of the needs in the next few years smith said will be more 
companies like packers to interpet the photos for farmers 
smith contended that satellite photography is simply going back 
to the basic principle of know your land

rjr nabisco incs prospective new owner formally 
began the biggest takeover in history tuesday amending a previous 
tender offer for the cigaretteandfood giants stock from 90 a 
share to the final price of 109 or nearly 25 billion 
the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co said in a 
statement that jan 11 was the deadline for rjr stockholders to 
submit their shares 
kohlberg will pay 109 a share in cash for 72 percent of rjrs 
outstanding shares but if all shareholders tender their shares as 
expected each will receive 81 a share in cash and 28 a share in 
securities 
the investment firm also said it intended to file additional 
information on wednesday with the securities and exchange commission 
concerning financing arrangements investment banking fees and other 
details 
kohlberg outmaneuvered a rival offer from rjrs top managers to 
win a tumultuous bidding contest for the nations 19th largest 
industrial company nov 30 
the investment firm has said it eventually intends to sell about 
6 billion in food assets of rjr the atlantabased maker of 
hundreds of products that range from ritz crackers to camel 
cigarettes 
rjrs debt load will more than quadruple under kohlberg which is 
using only a fraction of its own money for the purchase and will 
borrow the rest using rjrs assets as collateral in what is 
commonly called a leveraged buyout 
kohlberg has not specified how many of rjrs senior managers it 
intends to retain in the company but is expected to terminate the 
contracts of those who teamed with chief executive f ross johnson 
to make a rival bid johnson also is expected to leave but his 
intentions are unclear 
rjrs tobacco subsidiary switched assignments of three top 
executives in what it said monday was likely to be the first of a 
series of changes under kohlberg 
the price tag for rjr is nearly double the previous record for a 
corporate takeover the 134 billion acquisition of gulf oil corp 
by what is now chevron corp in 1984 
the rjr deal is also more than four times the size of previous 
record leveraged buyout the 61 billion sale of beatrice cos in 
1986 to a group led by kohlberg 
the scope and complexity of the rjr takeover raised new concern 
about the leveraged buyout trend particularly over whether such 
transactions threaten the nations economy by multiplying the level 
of corporate debt 
many economists and lawmakers have expressed fear that 
debtburdened companies such as rjr will forego important strategic 
investments for the sake of paying off debt moreover some say a 
slight rise in interest rates can have a devastating impact on such 
companies by increasing their debt payments

grain and soybean futures prices were sharply 
higher tuesday on the chicago board of trade as the markets finished 
a rollercoaster ride on the upside in the wake of activity by a 
single large trading company 
iowa grain co a chicagobased speculative trading firm 
triggered a sharp dip in grain and soybean prices just one day 
earlier by leading a selloff 
but tuesday the company bought soybeans early setting off a 
rally as traders followed the move iowa grain then turned around 
and sold beans but after prices broke reversed positions again and 
started buying 
and away we went said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds in chicago 
iowa grain also bought wheat setting off a rally in that pit 
iowa was so active it overshadowed concerns about the 
weather in south america lespinasse added what would otherwise 
have been a dull market turned lively and the traders followed iowa 
because they were calling the tune 
there had been pressure on soybean prices because of reports of 
rain in the soybeangrowing region of argentina and forecasts for 
rain in brazil where soybean planting also is under way 
on the close wheat was 4 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 419 a bushel corn was 2

reactions ranged from terrible to 
fresh at the unveiling of a mineral water flavored with 
truffles the subterranean fungi famed as the worlds most expensive 
food ingredient 
very few connoisseurs know what truffles really taste like 
commented restaurateur fritz castel as the mendocino beverage co 
unveiled a limited marketing of mineral water flavored with the 
highly aromatic essence of frances 500apound perigord truffles 
the main fame of the fungi which are available only a few months 
of the year comes from the way they are harvested by trained pigs 
and dogs that sniff out the delicacy where it grows at the base of 
certain trees in france and italy and lately in the northern 
california and oregon forests 
the 10ounce bottle of flavored water is priced at 4 and is to 
be sold for now only in the gourmet department of the neiman 
marcus department store here a threeliter bottle of the water was 
auctioned for 950 last summer at the sonoma valley wine auction 
without the truffle juice a 10ounce bottle of the water costs 
50 cents 
thats terrible a wine writer remarked at fridays unveiling 
to a food writer who thought hmmm its very fresh and unusual 
i dont know if it will sell 
when a new york times writer reviewed the drink the headline on 
the column said earthiness that should have stayed in the earth 
it has a certain earthiness said one participant at the 
tasting another thought it was an interesting way to find out what 
all the truffle fuss is about 
chefs throughout the world fight each other each winter and 
spring for a few ounces of truffles they are used to flavor and 
lend a distinctive aroma to the most special dishes a single 
truffle can flavor gallons of food 
its something special said mendocino beverages owner 
georg mollerracke who commissioned restaurateur john ashe to 
formulate the drink mollerracke touted the truffle water as an 
upscale alterative for people who dont drink alcohol but want a 
special touch in their bottled water

when john patrick doherty first read about this 
weeks reagangorbachev meeting his thoughts quickly shifted to one 
major issue what were they doing for lunch 
i was wondering if they planned to meet at the waldorf 
confessed doherty the head chef at the manhattan luxury hotel and 
creator of the meal the two world leaders will share wednesday 
last wednesday they asked me if i would be interested i 
submitted three menus for approval they chose one on friday 
said doherty a waldorf chef for the past 11 years it was great 
i was very happy 
cooking for president reagan and mikhail gorbachev is no 
different from preparing any other meal except for the presence of 
secret service agents in the kitchen doherty said tuesday between 
samples of the wild mushroom ravioli which will start the summit 
lunch 
as much attention and care as im giving this you have to do 
that with everything said doherty who became head chef 3 years 
ago you dont get a reputation for quality cooking as a quality 
chef by being supercreative the truly good chefs the quality of 
their preparation is topnotch 
initially the white house had declared the luncheon menu 
offlimits to the news media until after the meal but the 
restrictions were eased enough for doherty to provide some word on 
what would be served 
first will come a chicken consomme and the wild mushroom ravioli 
followed by tournedos or rounded filets of veal with smoked quail 
and lobster sausage braised cabbage and leeks roesti potatoes that 
are julienned and sauteed until crisp and sauteed fresh leaf 
spinach 
wine will be a california chardonnay dessert is a chocolate tart 
with almond cream cheese fresh fruit and raspberry sauce 
total preparation time for the lunch for 14 people will be about 
four hours said doherty who was being assisted by two other 
waldorf chefs final touches will be made at governors island the 
historic fort and coast guard complex in new york harbor where the 
luncheon will be held 
since reagan generally stays at the waldorfastoria when in new 
york it will not be the first time doherty 30 has prepared a 
presidential repast and reagan has twice personally complimented 
him on his cooking the chef said 
this style of cooking is what he prefers doherty said of the 
president there are some guidelines for keeping his health in 
mind but ive done this many times

stock prices pushed ahead for the second straight 
session today following the lead of a very strong government bond 
market 
prices of longterm government bonds which move in the opposite 
direction from interest rates climbed about 20 for each 1000 in 
face value today 
analysts said bonds were buoyed by hopes that soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev who arrived in the united states this afternoon 
would make proposals that would allow cutbacks in defense spending 
under the reasoning that seemed to prevail in the markets that 
would in turn reduce inflationary pressures and help the united 
states deal with its budget deficit 
most of the stock markets gains came late in the session on a 
wave of computer program trading by professionals 
the markets latest upswing has also been attributed partly to a 
new restructuring tactic announced by four large companies monday 
and reported to be under consideration by several others 
the deals involve the proposed swap of unbundled stock units 
or packages of three different types of securities for large

japan has been keeping a low profile in a 
critical round of international trade talks here in contrast with 
its prowess as a global trader 
japan which enjoys the biggest trade surplus in the world is 
one of 100 countries taking part in talks on liberalizing and 
updating the 40yearold general agreement on tariffs and trade 
but among the dozens of position papers floating around the halls 
of montreals convention center few have been japans and japanese 
officials have been elusive 
unlike the united states the european economic community host 
nation canada and such countries as india japan has not briefed 
reporters once on its positions over the past four days of talks 
the only scheduled japanese briefing was canceled because the 
person who was supposed to conduct the session was busy 
in contrast to the growing leadership position japan has been 
assuming on the world monetary and financial front it continues to 
be highly sensitive on trade 
on the most divisive point in the negotiations the battle 
between the united states and the 12nation eec on agricultural 
subsidies japan has been on the sidelines 
as the chief eec negotiator willy de clercq put it the 
japanese have been sitting back and looking at this like a pingpong 
game between us and the americans 
the debate which has divided the allegiances of other nations 
concerns a us demand for eliminaton of tradedistorting farm 
supports which the europeans reject out of hand 
although japan is the worlds biggest importer of agricultural 
products it appears more than happy to let the two slug it out 
our position is that there is no point in making decisions 
until they settle said mutsuyoshi nishimura japans director of 
foreign press relations 
nishimura said that whatever the outcome japans prime concern 
is the protection of its rice market against foreign imports 
the united states seeking support for its position in the gatt 
talks has promised to take into account the concerns of other 
countries over food security 
translated this means allowing other countries to stockpile 
emergency food supplies 
but nishimura said japan was still not clear whether the us 
promise would guarantee japan the right to limit imports of rice 
we have a vulnerable sector of rice farmers and they are a 
very strong constituency he said in an interview we must step 
gingerly 
underscoring the political sensitivity of the issue japans 
ruling liberal democratic party sent a delegation to the montreal 
talks to make sure the professional negotiators did not cave in to 
pressure 
japan has been particularly concerned at threats that the united 
states would use a new trade bill to retaliate against its closed 
rice import policies 
but the united states and japan appear to have reached a tacit 
understanding that the americans would not push the rice issue in 
montreal if the japanese agreed to leave it on the table for future 
talks 
conscious of its international commitment to assume broader 
leadership in the world commensurate with its economic power japan 
adopted a package in montreal that reduces tariffs on exports by 
developing nations to the industrialized world 
under the agreement japan will reduce tariffs on the import of 
some 180 tropical products worth about 3 billion in annual 
imports nishimura said 
but rice was kept out of that package much to japans relief 
the japanese arent willing to stick their necks out like we 
are or even the united states said one european official 
but nishimura disagreed with that assessment saying japans low 
profile was a reflection of national character 
we may not be as articulate as some but we are as assertive as 
we need to be he said

a lawyer for dalkon shield claimants said 
tuesday that the process by which the ah robins co inc 
bankruptcy plan was approved effectively disenfranchised women with 
the largest injury claims 
a threejudge panel of the 4th circuit court of appeals heard 
arguments challenging the reorganization plan which includes a 25 
billion trust fund for women injured by the robinsmanufactured 
dalkon shield birth control device a ruling is not expected for 
several months 
alan b morrison a lawyer for the public citizen litigation 
group in washington dc argued that confirmation of the plan was 
invalid because claimants were not given a range of possible 
monetary awards when they voted to approve it and because their 
votes were not weighted 
morrison criticized the unexplained and unjustified refusal 
of us district judge robert r merhige who approved the plan in 
july to break down the 25 billion figure instead he said 
claimants were simply told they would be paid in full with no 
explanation of what that meant 
the only logical reason he didnt break out the numbers is 
because they wouldnt stand up morrison told the judges 
he said the vote in which more than 95 percent of the claimants 
returning ballots voted in favor of the plan might have come out 
differently if women with larger claims had been given weighted 
votes the bankruptcy code requires that creditors votes be 
weighted according to the size of their claims morrison said 
that in effect disenfranchised those with large claims 
morrison said 
but james c roberts an attorney for robins said weighting the 
votes would have been timeconsuming and impractical merhige 
tried mightily to come up with a system of weighted voting but 
was unable to roberts said if the value of claims had to be 
estimated in advance so that votes could be weighted the job 
would never be done he said 
roberts said merhige based the 25 billion figure on expert 
testimony at an estimation hearing last year claimants had more 
information than the law required about possible award amounts he 
said 
morrison also challenged a provision of the bankruptcy plan that 
prevents claimants from filing suit against doctors robins 
officers law firms and other third parties in the case he said 
third parties are not entitled to bankruptcy protection without 
filing for bankruptcy and claimants should be allowed to sue them 
to recover full damages 
the appellate panel also heard challenges to a settlement with 
aetna casualty amp surety co robins insurer and to merhiges 
authority over the claim fund trustees 
close to 200000 women have filed claims of dalkon shieldrelated 
injuries ranging from infections to sterility miscarriage and 
children born with birth defects the bulk of those claims cannot be 
settled until appeals to the reorganization plan are exhausted 
robins filed for bankruptcy in august 1985 after thousands of 
women filed suit against the company the reorganization plan 
provides for the richmond pharmaceutical company to be acquired by 
american home products corp of new york in a 700 million exchange 
of stock american home can back out of the plan if appeals are not 
settled by next july

in what would be the fastest growth since the 
early 1970s the international monetary fund said it expects the 
economies of the seven biggest industrial nations to expand 425 
percent this year 
michel camdessus director general of the imf announced the 
upward revision in the output of goods and services from 40 
percent as he said the rapid growth created a golden 
opportunity for the industrialized nations to open their markets 
to each other and to developing nations 
we are now in a good growth period camdessus told reporters 
late monday in advance of a speech tuesday at freetrade talks under 
auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the group of seven countries covered by the imf forecast are the 
united states japan britain france west germany italy and 
canada 
the imf has steadily raised its forecast for growth in the seven 
countries from 325 percent to 38 percent to 4 percent and now 
425 percent the actual growth for this year will not be known 
until sometime in 1989 
on inflation the imf is keeping its most recent forecast of an 
inflation rate of 32 percent in the seven countries this year 
camdessus said 
in spite of the healthy growth camdessus said he was concerned 
by evidence of an increase in nontariff barriers to world trade 
among a broader range of industrialized nations 
according to a new imf report the industrial countries made more 
restrictive changes in trade policy last year than liberalizing 
changes 85 to 66 
in contrast the report said developing countries made more 
liberalizing changes than restrictive ones 227 to 126 
protectionism in industrialized nations hampers the ability of 
developing nations to grow through exports and deal with their 
crushing debt burdens 
the new imf report has other ammunition for free traders quoting 
from a united nations report it said 23 percent of the imports of 
developed countries aside from fuel were subject to nontariff 
measures last year up from 19 percent in 1981 
worldwide farm supports cost consumers and taxpayers an average 
of 185 billion a year in 1984 through 1986 the report said 
quoting the organization for economic cooperation and development 
the international monetary fund was created after world war ii to 
tide over countries that faced shortterm debt crises and to promote 
world trade it is now closely involved in the affairs of many 
heavily indebted developing countries 
camdessus said he welcomed the plans of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade to monitor more closely the adherence of all 
nations to freetrade principles that surveillance would parallel 
the surveillance that the imf already does of countries debt 
servicing and commitment to growthoriented policies 
many developing nations already irked by the imfs involvement 
in their domestic affairs are concerned that the gatt will become 
another meddling hand 
the imf report said that since free trade helps all countries 
involved in it it does not make economic sense to delay 
unilateral measures to obtain multilateral liberalization 
in his briefing to reporters camdessus said it would be 
suicidal for nations to insist that progress in other areas of 
free trade be linked to progress on their own particular issues 
unless we press forward the risk is that we shall move 
backward he said in the text of his speech

gain tuesday benefiting from a sharp drop in openmarket interest 
rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 2560 to 214936 
on top of a 3148point jump monday

totaled 19025 million shares 
prices of longterm government bonds which move in the opposite 
direction from interest rates climbed about 20 for each 1000 in 
face value tuesday 
analysts said bonds were buoyed by hopes that soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev who arrived in the united states tuesday 
afternoon would make proposals that would allow cutbacks in defense 
spending 
under the reasoning that seemed to prevail in the markets that 
would in turn stand to reduce inflationary pressures and help the 
united states deal with its budget deficit 
most of the stock markets gains came late in the session on a 
wave of computer program trading by professionals 
the markets latest upswing has also been attributed partly to a 
new restructuring tactic announced by four large companies monday 
and reported to be under consideration by several others 
the deals involve the proposed swap of unbundled stock units 
or packages of three different types of securities for large 
amounts of their outstanding common shares 
the idea drew mixed reviews from analysts and accountants some 
of whom criticized it as a gimmick 
however some investors evidently saw it as a potential boost to 
the values put on companies by the marketplace

speculation that financier carl icahn who holds big stakes in both 
companies might be planning some new move

presidentelect george bush who has pledged to 
give trade a top priority filled the governments top two trade 
policy jobs tuesday with texas oilman robert mosbacher as commerce 
secretary and prominent washington lawyer carla hills as us trade 
representative 
the vice president announcing his latest choices at a news 
conference in the old executive office building said he was 
completing his economic team with the naming of stanford economist 
michael boskin as chairman of the council of economic advisers 
bush also told reporters he had decided to take the offensive 
on coming up with a budget strategy that attacks the federal deficit 
without new taxes it is my responsibility to do that what that 
means in terms of form i am not quite sure yet he said 
ms hills 54 who was secretary of housing and urban development 
in 197577 under president ford is the first woman bush has 
designated for a highlevel position in his administration 
although the trade post was not originally a cabinetlevel job 
reagan elevated it to such ms hills told reporters that bush had 
agreed to retain the post as a cabinet position in his 
administration 
mosbacher 61 is an old friend from bushs oil days in houston 
in the 1960s bush said that mosbacher would bring to the post 
tremendous energies to promoting exports abroad 
currently the chairman of the mosbacher energy co of houston 
mosbacher was finance chairman of bushs presidential campaign 
bush announced the two top trade jobs commerce and trade 
representative in the midst of delicate trade negotiations in 
montreal under the auspices of the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade gatt 
in montreal kelley winkler an aide to current trade 
representative clayton yeutter said the changes would not affect 
the us position in favor of phasing out all international 
agricultural subsidies by the end of the century 
bush has proposed making the subject of agricultural subsidies 
the top agenda item on his first economic summit to be held next 
spring in france 
the trade representative negotiates trade agreements with other 
countries and investigates complaints of unfair trade practices the 
commerce secretary enforces trade policy and seeks more markets for 
us goods as well as serving as a voice for us business within 
the government 
the commerce secretary also oversees one of the governments most 
varied agencies ranging from the national weather service to the 
census bureau to the national bureau of standards 
mosbacher who is worth an estimated 200 million from his oil 
and gas holdings and investments in real estate and ranching is a 
former chairman of the national petroleum council 
he takes over from former steel executive c william verity who 
has held the job for only a year reagan appointed verity after the 
death of commerce secretary malcolm baldrige in a freak horseback 
riding accident 
transition officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said 
mosbacher had been promised the job several weeks ago but that the 
fbi background check on him had taken longer than anticipated 
because of his vast financial holdings 
among the tasks facing the new secretary will be implementing the 
new freetrade agreement with canada already approved by the united 
states but awaiting canadian ratification bush during his campaign 
said he would like to see a similar pact negotiated with mexico 
the trade deficit was 170 billion last year and was running at 
an annual rate of 137 billion this year making the two trade jobs 
ones of high visibility

pork futures prices plunged to limitdown levels tuesday after a 
late selloff by traders worried that frozen pork bellies are piling 
up at already overstocked warehouses 
on other markets treasury bond futures soared on rumors that 
improving superpower relations exemplified by soviet president 
mikhail gorbachevs visit may ultimately mean lower us defense 
spending level and a meaningful cut in the budget deficit grain and 
soybeans futures prices finished sharply higher in the wake of one 
trading firms daylong trading machinations and platinum futures 
posted an impressive gain as gold and silver slipped slightly 
we had quite a selloff said chuck levitt of shearson lehman 
hutton inc chicago but then the pork complex has been like 
water running upstream the last couple of sessions 
levitt said generally good underlying cash prices for the pork 
bellies at this time of year led many traders to view the futures 
market as undervalued 
but every tuesday we get a report on warehouse supplies on 
how much product is actually pouring into storage and we get some 
liquidation in this situation he added no one was around to 
stick up for the markets 
the chicago mercantile exchanges outoftown warehouse report 
released after the close of trading tuesday was even more bearish 
than most traders expected stocks in 48 approved warehouses which 
represent the majority of bellies in storage nationwide showed a 
net gain of 72 million pounds over the previous week 
at the merc live cattle settled 08 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with the contrtact for delivery in december at 7137 cents a 
pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 35 cent lower with january 
at 8225 cents a pound hogs were 55 cent lower to 05 cent higher 
with december at 4062 cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 
132 cents to a limitdown 2 cents lower with february at 4357 
cents a pound 
treasury bond futures went in the opposite direction at the 
chicago board of trade settling 1 2232 to 1 2332 higher with 
december at 89 2232 
the dollar strengthened but that was an incredibly strong move 
in tbonds with no real economic news said rich sandor of drexel 
burnham lambert inc chicago 
the rumors have it that gorbachev will propose a unilateral 
troop reduction that he didnt come a couple thousand miles just to 
have lunch the market read that to mean theres the real potential 
for lowered defense spending and a real move on lowering the 
deficit not that far down the road 
grain and soybean futures prices finished a daylong 
rollercoaster ride on the upside at the chicago board of trade 
iowa grain co a chicagobased speculative trading firm 
triggered a sharp dip in grain and soybean prices just one day 
earlier by leading a selloff 
but tuesday the company bought soybeans early setting off a 
rally as traders followed the move iowa grain then turned around 
and sold beans but after prices broke reversed positions again and 
started buying 
iowa grain also bought wheat setting off a rally in that pit 
what would otherwise have been a dull market turned lively and 
the traders followed iowa because they were calling the tune said 
victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds in chicago 
on the close wheat was 4 cents to 8 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in december at 419 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents higher with december at 258 a bushel oats were 
3 cents to 7 cents higher with march at 198 a bushel soybeans 
were 14 cents to 16 cents higher with january at 772 a bushel 
platinum closed 30 cents lower to 670 higher with the december 
contract at the new york mercantile exchange at 61180 a troy 
ounce gold meanwhile was 160 to 180 lower with december at 
42750 a troy ounce and silver was 2 cents to 9 cents lower with 
the december conbtrract at the comex at 6161 cents a troy ounce 
gold and silver are retreating because of the strength of the 
dollar and the bond markets performance said jack barbanel 
director of futures trading for gruntal amp co new york 
but platinum has a life of its own because of the demand 
for the actual commodity

the federal occupational safety and health 
administration proposed fines tuesday totaling 71620 against 
eastern airlines for alleged health violations involving exposure of 
its workers to cadmium dust 
osha inspectors found the alleged violations after an inspection 
at the landing gear shop at miami international airport the 
inspection began june 7 
eastern officials will meet with osha dec 21 to discuss the 
proposed fine company spokeswoman karen ceremsak said 
eastern last year took corrective measures to make sure no 
employees were exposed to this substance by changing the procedure 
for stripping landing gears ceremsak said 
following the osha inspection eastern sent workers potentially 
exposed to cadium to hospitals for medical tests ceremsak said the 
tests determined the workers had suffered no toxic effects she said 
the machinists union could not be reached for comment immediately 
cadmium has long been recognized as an industrial health hazard 
that can cause serious kidney and lung damage and may cause 
cancer said jose sanchez oshas fort lauderdalearea director 
osha is committed to minimizing worker exposure to cadmium and 
other harmful substances 
osha inspectors found employees who grind landing gear components 
were exposed to cadmium dust levels up to 60 times the permissible 
level about 20 workers were employed in the area where the 
conditions were found 
the inspectors learned that in 1987 an eastern environmental 
health expert had recommended the installation of engineering 
controls in the shop to limit cadmium dust exposure but company 
officials did not follow the recommendation osha said 
the agency cited eastern for seven alleged willful 
violations proposing a 10000 penalty for each the maximum 
allowed by law it also cited the airline for two alleged serious 
violations carrying fines of 900 and 720 for lesser 
infractions 
the willful violations allege the airline failed to inform 
workers they were exposed to cadmium provide an effective 
respiratory protection program adequately test the respirators 
prohibit storage and consumption of food and beverages in areas 
contaminated with cadmium dust keep cadmium levels at or below the 
mandated osha limits and use engineering controls and exhaust 
ventilation to control exposure to the dust 
osha defines a willful violation as one in which the violator 
either knew that a condition constituted a violation or was aware 
that a hazardous condition existed and made no reasonable effort to 
correct it a serious condition is one in which there was a 
substantial probability that a death or serious injury could occur 
and the employer knew or should have known about it 
eastern has 15 working days to contest the citations and proposed 
penalties before the independent occupational safety and health 
review commission
