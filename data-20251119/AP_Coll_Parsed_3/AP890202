tv evangelist jimmy swaggart who has 
threatened a libel suit for a strippers story of an alleged sexual 
liaison with him said wednesday that he knows of another effort 
being planned to discredit him 
speaking to about 600 people at his family worship center 
swaggart again accused penthouse magazine of scheming to destroy his 
ministry with a story in which catherine mary kampen said she 
performed sex acts for him while he watched 
without revealing any details swaggart said his ministry had 
uncovered another move against him swaggart said the plan involved 
different people 
theres another effort afoot as preposterous as this one 
if you have enough money you can get anyone to say anything 
swaggart said 
kampens allegations are similar to those raised last year by a 
prostitute debra murphree which led to swaggarts ouster from the 
assemblies of god a pentecostal denomination and reversed the 
fortunes of jimmy swaggart world ministries 
kampens employer labeled the strippers allegations detailed in 
penthouses current issue a pornographic fairy tale the 
magazine said monday that it was standing by its article 
on monday swaggart said there was not one shred of truth to 
these allegations i have never met or seen the woman swaggarts 
attorneys said they had evidence the story was a hoax but refused 
to discuss specifics 
wednesday night swaggart said the ministry was approached by a 
man in december who knew of kampens allegations and spilled his 
insides he said he believed it was a hoax 
swaggart also said a woman he identified as kampens employer 
also called the ministry and said she knew the story was false 
swaggart did not reveal the callers name 
rhonda shear coowner of a stripogram service that employs 
kampen in new orleans said monday that her sister nona told her 
kampen made up the story after seeing the penthouse story on 
murphrees relations with swaggart 
shears sister contacted in new orleans said a lawyer had 
advised her not to comment efforts to reach kampen for comment have 
been unsuccessful 
swaggart said the man who revealed kampens story to the ministry 
had told him penthouse publisher bob guccione was angry because of 
swaggarts work in pressuring convenience stores to discontinue 
carrying the mens magazine 
a telephone call after business hours wednesday seeking comment 
from penthouses spokesmen at their new york city offices was not 
answered 
swaggart said that during the past year he had learned not to 
judge people ive learned that im not god he also advised his 
congregation not to get to the point where its us and them 
his ministry would continue with expanded television programming 
to china brazil and the netherlands swaggart said we are going 
to go forward to tell the story of jesus christ as we have never 
gone forth before he said

president bush said in a telegram to 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega that he was willing to work for 
peace ortega said wednesday 
ortega also met on wednesday with former president carter and 
presidentelect carlos andres perez of venezuela ortega and carter 
both are in venezuela for perez inauguration ceremonies this week 
ortega brought with him a new peace proposal which he showed to 
perez carter and others 
carter declined to discuss specifics but told reporters it dealt 
with nicaragua and its neighbor honduras which the usbacked 
nicaraguan rebels have used as a base for some operations 
a source close to vice president dan quayle who is in venezuela 
for perez inauguration said the plan had to do with resettlement 
of rebels in nicaragua once peace is achieved 
contra leader alfredo cesar said that socialist international 
leaders familiar with the plan told him it also contained provisions 
for political prisoners in nicaraqua and for granting civil 
liberties in the country 
ortega said in a live interview on venezuela television that he 
sent a letter of congratulations to bush after the new us 
presidents inauguration and that bush sent him a telegram in 
response in which he said he was willing to work for peace 
ortega said he reminded bush of the time they shook hands at the 
inauguration of brazilian president jose sarney in 1985 when bush 
was vice president and how all the leaders of the world applauded 
this unanimously 
in a press conference after the interview ortega said that the 
conditions are not yet ripe for a direct dialogue between the 
united states and nicaragua 
ortega said he would be meeting with honduran president jose 
azcona hoyos and other central american presidents this week in 
caracas to discuss regional problems 
this will give us an opportunity to talk about common problems 
including the peace plan its advances and a meeting of central 
american presidents he said 
ortegas meeting with azcona on wednesday would be before a 
meeting azcona plans to hold with quayle on friday 
azcona said this week that the five central american presidents 
have agreed to a summit on feb 1415 in san salvador to discuss the 
peace plan adopted in august 1987 
the presidents are expected to be in caracas for the perez 
inauguration 
after meeting with ortega and carter perez said in a communique 
that the meeting was a great step towards the solution to the 
problem of central america and nicaragua although it did not 
elaborate 
it emphasized that carter was not acting as a representative of 
the us government during his stay here 
the former president moderated a forum on the latin american 
foreign debt and noted in his brief comments that last year alone 
poor nations transferred 35 billion to rich countries in debt 
payments 
we must seek solutions to the crises of nations desperately 
poor and suffering who spend sometimes half their export earnings 
just to pay interest on their debt and in the process the debt 
continues to increase carter said 
this reunion of world leaders is a wonderful opportunity to 
assess this crucial problem he said

power to a big chunk of salt lake city on wednesday night with 
blackouts extending 40 miles to ogden said utah power amp light co 
spokesman dave eskelsen 
eskelsen said engineers believed the outage was the result of 
dirty rain coating insulators on power poles and blowing fuses 
and some crews had reports of burning power poles

20degree temperatures for the hypothermia death of a 31yearold 
woman whose frozen body was found on a sidewalk in coleraine

northway posted an extreme of another sort when the barometric

reading for the north american continent the reading there eased 
off wednesday morning but was still a high 3131 inches it was the

adminitration early wednesday issued an order restricting instrument 
and night flights over alaska saying that altimeters that use 
barometric pressure might not calculate a planes altitude

southern plains faced new stresses without the blanket of snow that 
usually keeps it safe during the winter and ranchers across the

with money pouring from a booming export 
business a lust for gambling has taken hold and turned this 
nationalist chinese island into a massive underground casino 
officials say it threatens to disrupt the economy 
the gambling craze is attributed to the flood of idle cash 
created by taiwans economic success and of limited investment 
opportunities 
its worse than a huge casino said a dismayed jaw shaokang 
a legislator of the governing nationalist party we dont even 
have fair gambling rules and decent bookies 
gambling is illegal in taiwan but an estimated 2 million people 
or roughly onetenth the population play an underground game based 
on results of a twiceweekly lottery in nearby hong kong 
they are lured by the chance to win 10 to 500 times their bets 
which typically are 500 taiwan dollars 18 or more only a tiny 
fraction of players about 6000 people were arrested or fined last 
year 
the game became a favorite with farmers factory workers and 
market vendors after the government suspended its own lottery in 
1987 to break up underground gambling based on the drawing 
on tuesdays and thursdays when the hong kong lottery is held 
taiwans telephone lines are jammed by people calling bookies for 
results 
gamblers pray to folk gods for winning numbers and often 
celebrate at buddhist temples when they win 
the lottery gamblers have gone too far fumed ching 
meihsien principal of taipeis fu shing primary school which is 
near such a temple their noisy celebrations often disrupt our 
students in class 
taiwans two largest cities taipei and kaohsiung recently 
proposed running their own lotteries to raise funds for social 
welfare programs cabinet approval is needed for the drawings to 
begin later this year 
meanwhile tens of thousands of taiwanese have turned to gambling 
on futures prices on commodity markets in chicago and new york 
an estimated 500 local companies including jewelry shops and 
investment firms accept daily bets totaling about 5 billion taiwan 
dollars 179 million based on the movement of futures prices on 
the overseas markets according to martin tsai a financial 
consultant with the alliance international law office which advises 
businesses and government agencies 
newspapers estimate each company has about 160 clients meaning 
about 80000 people gamble on commodity prices 
even the local stock exchange is widely viewed as little more 
than a legal form of gambling many inexperienced players such as 
housewives office clerks retired servicemen and college students 
view the market solely as a way to make quick money through 
speculation 
the exchange reported in january that about 166 million people 
have opened accounts with stock brokers trading volume totaled the 
taiwan dollar equivalent of about 280 billion last year the third 
largest in the world after new york and tokyo 
on average each of the total 34 billion shares changed hands 
nearly three times last year even though roughly twothirds of the 
shares were closely held and not for sale 
frederick chien chairman of the staterun council for economic 
planning and development believes the gambling craze has changed 
traditional values that helped taiwan improve its economy 
dramatically with per capita annual income in 1988 of 157400 
taiwan dollars 5512 a 56 percent increase from 1983 
so many people are obsessed with speculation chien said 
they want to become rich overnight and they no longer work so 
hard for the money 
in a recent speech economics minister chen lian said the trend 
could eventually erode taiwans economic achievement he complained 
that businesmen increasingly prefer the pursuit of quick profit 
through gambling and speculation over productive investment 
liu shouhsiang an economics professor at chinese culture 
university in taipei said the lack of channels for investment is a 
major reason behind the upswing in gambling most bonds are 
purchased by banks real estate is too expensive and only a few 
mutual funds are allowed 
the government has taken some steps to help open up new 
investment opportunities in recent years easing foreign exchange 
controls to stimulate overseas investment 
some taiwanese still fear overseas investments as an unknown 
risk however and have been reluctant to diversify

a man whose pregnant wife has been in a coma 
for seven weeks urged asked a judge wednesday to appoint him her 
legal guardian so he can authorize an abortion that he says will 
save her life 
martin kleins 32yearold wife nancy was critically injured in 
a car collision on dec 13 and is in a coma at north shore 
university hospital in manhasset 
klein 34 a selfemployed accountant who lives in upper 
brookville on long island told the court that physicians have 
advised him that an abortion is necessary to save his wifes life 
and assist in her recovery 
his petition is opposed by antiabortion activists john short and 
john broderick who have asked the court to be appointed legal 
guardians of the fetus which is about 16 to 18 weeks old 
the case considered unprecedented by legal and medical experts 
is being heard by justice bernard mccaffrey of the triallevel state 
supreme court 
mrs kleins parents anne and frederick zusselman of delray 
fla attended wednesdays hearing and said they too were in favor 
of ending their daughters pregnancy 
mrs zusselman told the court that her daughter and soninlaw 
who have a 3yearold daughter had been looking forward to having a 
second child 
asked if she agreed that ending the pregnancy was in her 
daughters best interest mrs zusselman replied absolutely 
three physicians called to testified by kleins attorney sidney 
schutz said that a continued pregnancy could endanger mrs kleins 
wellbeing 
dr joseph smith a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at 
albert einstein college of medicine said he felt strongly that 
ending the pregnancy was necessary to save her life and should be 
done immediately he said 
a continuation of this pregnancy would push her over the 
cliff smith said 
dr robert carras chief of neurosurgery at north shore said 
that the prognosis for mrs klein was guarded because of the 
pregnancy and other conditions 
the nassau county district attorneys office was allowed to 
monitor the proceedings to ensure that there is no criminal 
violation of law according to assistant district attorney wayne 
kiernan 
schutz objected to the prosecutors involvement what is this 
nonsense of a criminal statute he said we are doing nothing 
criminal here we are only asking the court to appoint an guardian 
for the welfare of a woman in a coma 
the case was continued to thursday at which time the judge was 
expected to consider the petitions of the two righttolife 
advocates

police arrested about 20 people during a 
protest against romanias alleged repression of ethnic hungarians 
and its campaign of demolishing villages a spokeswoman for the 
activists said 
the demonstration outside the romanian embassy was organized by 
members of the polish socialist party and solidarity trade union 
movement said the spokeswoman zuzanna dabrowska both 
organizations are banned 
ms dabrowska said a small group of protesters on tuesday 
gathered in front of the embassy and shouted we are in solidarity 
with the romanians 
the group distributed leaflets to about 100 people across the 
street from the embassy before police began making arrests 
we would like feb 1 to become the day of solidarity with the 
romanian nation the situation there has not changed and its 
important we establish such a tradition dabrowska said 
romanian leader nicolae ceausescus plan to demolish up to 7000 
villages in his soviet bloc country and replace them with huge 
agroindustrial complexes has been widely criticized as a flagrant 
violation of human rights 
hungary is particularly concerned that many of the villages to be 
razed are inhabited by ethnic hungarians and last year the official 
polish press pointed out that a few of the villages are populated by 
ethnic poles

spurred by the us decision to open talks with 
the plo israelis have embarked on a serious debate about a subject 
once virtually taboo here talking peace with the palestinian 
organization 
the subject is debated almost daily on radio shows and in 
newspaper columns at least two members of the leftleaning labor 
party cabinet minister ezer weizman and exminister abba eban have 
called for talking to yasser arafats representatives 
the broadbased peace now movement recently changed its position 
to support talks with the palestine liberation organization 
we must speak with them we must listen we must exchange 
words we have to talk to those we want to make peace with 
said galia golan a leading peace now figure 
she and eban are attending a conference on the 
israelipalestinian conflict in amsterdam along with plo officials 
despite an israeli law against meetings with members of 
terrorist organizations 
for many israelis accepting the plo is not just a political but 
a psychological hurdle 
for years they have associated it with atrocities such as the 
1972 massacre of 11 israeli athletes at the olympic games in munich 
but a public opinion poll late last year indicated 54 percent of 
israelis support talks with the plo provided the organization 
renounces terrorism and accepts israels right to exist 
the change in opinion is due in part to the palestinian uprising 
in the west bank and gaza strip and in part to arafats statements 
in december renouncing terrorism and accepting israels existence 
strong tactics aimed at quelling the 13month uprising or 
intefadeh have brought international criticism of israel at least 
370 palestinians and 15 israelis have died in the rebellion 
before the intefadeh we saw the palestinians in the occupied 
territories as construction workers and palestinians outside were 
terrorists said moshe amirov who was kicked out of the 
rightwing likud bloc for holding talks with proplo figures two 
years ago now there is a whole new image the image of a 
14yearold boy who throws stones and who cannot be beaten by our 
army 
the plo chiefs new moderate stance has isolated israel 
the united states agreed to open a dialogue with the plo in 
december and several european nations are urging israel to do the 
same 
prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of the rightwing likud 
bloc repeated tuesday he would never speak to the plo his partys 
coalition agreement with labor takes that stand but dovish members 
of labor are starting to call for changes 
at least two labor members are among the four israeli legislators 
who have attended meetings along with plo officials in the past 
month 
weizman a former air force officer and defense minister said in 
an interview with the jerusalem post last week shamir should drop 
the ban on talking to the plo 
today the only party able to deliver what it promises in the 
territories able to bring about an end to the rioting is the 
plo he said 
but opponents including likud which won the most votes in 
november elections say the plo has not changed despite arafats 
statements 
the bottom line is they want a palestinian state in judea and 
samarea just as a down payment to throw us out of here said likud 
member tzahi hanegbi judea and samarea are the biblical names of 
the occupied west bank 
security risks are a persuasive argument even israelis who 
support talks with the plo are aware of the risk a palestinian state 
might pose to the jewish state 
israelis have fought five wars with arab states in 40 years and 
still remember the vulnerable narrow borders before israel captured 
the west bank and gaza strip in the 1967 middle east war

it takes a special tusker to carry 
buddhas tooth 
that task will fall to indiraja a 4884pound elephant from 
india named in honor of the late prime minister indira gandhi 
but indiraja who will be shipped to sri lanka next week to begin 
years of training in the sacred service of buddha has a tough act 
to follow 
the new elephant will replace raja a popular pachyderm who 
served for half a century at the temple of the tooth in kandy 
according to neranjan wijeratne the temples chief custodian raja 
was long in the tooth himself reaching the age of 82 before dying 
in july 
the 13yearold indiraja also a male was selected for his 
proper posture so that he may carry the sacred tooth of buddha in 
one of asias most colorful pageants 
it will take couple of years to train the elephant wijeratne 
said wednesday he picked out indiraja during a visit to india after 
prime minister rajiv gandhi announced plans to donate an elephant to 
the temple in kandy 50 miles east of colombo 
the death of the beloved raja whose name means king in the 
sinhalese language plunged sinhalese buddhists into grief raja was 
so popular that former president junius r jayewardene declared him 
a national treasure 
indiraja who will arrive in sri lanka on feb 8 measures 7 
feet from head to toe and has a flat back both his tail and trunk 
touch the ground in the arc deemed proper for elephants 
the main task for indiraja will be carrying the sacred tooth 
revered as coming from buddhas own mouth at the annual kandy 
pageant which is held for two weeks in july and august 
because indiraja still will be in training at the time of this 
years festivities the temple committe is trying to find a local 
male elephant only males can carry the tooth for the task 
efforts are on either to reduce the amount of fireworks and noise 
so that the untrained elephant wont panic or have an elephant who 
is unaffected by noise and fireworks in the toothcarrying ceremony 
according to historians the tooth was smuggled into sri lanka 
from india in the 4th century for safekeeping during a war 
the tooth is kept in a golden casket at the temple at kandy 
during the festival it is paraded around the town on an elephants 
back 
buddhism was founded in india about 500 bc when siddhartha 
gautama born a prince achieved enlightenment he later came to be 
known as lord buddha 
sinhalese buddhists make up about 75 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people there are about 5 million buddhists in india

teacher mary alice blanton has received 
honors from law officers for trying to fight off a gunman who 
invaded her school a year ago but she is proudest that no children 
were harmed in the 12hour ordeal 
i thought about that when i heard of children getting killed 
and wounded at other schools in the country recently she said 
i was glad our children didnt have to see any blood blood is 
life 
recent shootings at schools in california and washington dc 
made me realize how thankful i am that it wasnt our school 
said dan carden headmaster of the west end christian school we 
dont want to turn our schools into prisons but weve got to do 
something to protect our children 
west end christian school is planning to build another campus he 
said and the first thing we thought about is security 
last feb 2 james harvey wearing denim clothes a baseballtype 
cap and carrying several guns entered the schools elementary 
building at 830 am accompanied by an unwitting accomplice and 
took more than 80 children hostage 
harvey allowed his companion to leave in the middle of the day 
but he remained until 830 pm when officers subdued him as he 
emerged after hearing a videotaped fae pardon sent from montgomery 
by gov guy hunt 
as the hours of the seige crept along harvey at times allowed 
groups of hostage children to go free but at the end mrs blantons 
and another class 26 people in all were still in their rooms 
harvey pleaded guilty in october to charges he kidnapped 110 
children and adults at the private school and was sentenced to a 
life term and five 20year terms with the judge recommending 
psychiatric help 
two of cardens children chris and kevin were in the third and 
first grades 
kevin carden said doesnt seem to show any afteraffects but 
chris has developed a fear of being left alone at times 
when kevin was freed that night carden said the childs only 
complaint was i didnt get to eat my lunch 
when released most children tended to react to their parents 
emotions he said the reason some kids were crying was because 
their parents were crying 
alan goodwin director of the indian rivers mental health center 
who was called in that day to try to alleviate concerns of parents 
said he believes the children have bounced back remarkably 
michael roberts of the psychology department at the university of 
alabama is working with colleagues in other cities where gunmen have 
appeared at schools to develop ways to help children 
its amazing but there have been very little psychological 
studies of such things roberts said were trying to come up 
with a network to study longrange effects 
when harvey entered mrs blantons room she attacked him with a 
bible story book before he ordered his accomplice to tie her up with 
tape 
i feel like when the children are at school they are my 
children and i have to take care of them she said 
after harvey pleaded guilty the madison county sheriffs 
department made mrs blanton an honorary member and last week the 
tuscaloosa fraternal order of police gave her a certificate 
signifying she had done more for law enforcement in tuscaloosa in 
1988 than anyone other than officers 
while in the school harvey demanded to see an associated press

allen ward has been barred from 
coaching his 10yearold daughters intramural basketball team 
because he has aids but ward hopes he wont be benched for long 
ward was dismissed last week after only one game as a volunteer 
coach at laurel elementary school 
already he has launched a petition drive to get himself 
reinstated and to protest the franklin county community schools 
policy dealing with aids 
the next step may be to keep me out of the school altogether 
ward said tuesday my daughter will be there for four more years 
and if we let them defeat us now i might not ever get to go to the 
school 
ward 37 contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from 
tainted blood products during openheart surgery in 1984 
the disease which attacks the bodys immune system is 
transmitted primarily through bodily fluids such as during sexual 
contact intravenous drug use and blood transfusions but not 
through casual contact 
ward volunteered to coach the team of fourth fifth and 
sixthgraders when his daughter dande decided to play at the school 
60 miles southeast of indianapolis 
i have no physical contact with them at all ward said i 
might throw a basketball to them but if theyre going to get it 
that way were all in trouble 
principal odell calihan and superintendent don jobe refused to 
comment saying only that they are following the school districts 
policy 
i know the situation but i cant comment and i wont confirm 
any names jobe said when asked about wards dismissal 
its just ignorance ward said they havent educated 
themselves on aids and how its transmitted but the way the disease 
is spreading they ought to start getting educated four or five 
years ago i didnt think id ever come down with something like 
this either 
a similar argument was made after school authorities in kokomo 
barred young ryan white from his classes because he has aids his 
family later moved to another town and his story was told recently 
in a television movie 
under the franklin county school districts aids policy approved 
in september employees suspected of carrying the aids virus must 
submit to a medical examination by a doctor selected by the school 
board 
if an employee tests positive for the virus a committee decides 
whether the employee is an immediate public health threat the 
superintendent serves on the committee and selects its members 
which include a public health physician and school officials 
if its not discrimination i dont know what is ward said 
the superintendent chooses who he wants on the committee so he 
can select people who support him i cant even go to the meeting to 
defend myself 
ward said many of the basketball players parents have signed a 
petition to reinstate him as coach 
id like to fight it and win it but at this point in time 
weve been struggling just to make ends meet and were not going to 
be able to put out a lot of money said ward whose family lives 
on his social security payments and the salary from his wifes 
factory job 
wards wife theresa has agreed to coach the team in the 
meantime but school officials say she first must be tested for the 
aids virus until his case is resolved ward plans to attend games 
as a spectator 
my daughter is on the team and they cant keep me from going to 
the games he said what i dont understand is whats the 
difference if im sitting on the bench with the team as their coach 
telling them when to go in and when to come out or sitting in the 
bleachers as a parent with the other kids all around me eating my 
popcorn

clayton k yeutter outgoing us trade 
representative and president bushs nominee be agriculture 
secretary was the guest of honor at a reception costing thousands 
of dollars sponsored by philip morris inc the food brewing and 
tobacco conglomerate according to the washington post 
yeutter whose confirmation hearing for the agriculture post is 
scheduled thursday did not check with his agencys ethics officer 
to see whether it would be appropriate to accept the hospitality of 
philip morris said roger bolton a spokesman for the trade office 
he considered such approval unnecessary in light of his 
imminent departure from the office bolton was quoted as telling 
the post in its thursday editions 
earlier the paper said bolton said that when the idea for the 
reception first arose yeutter was planning to return to private 
life and the reception was viewed here as a thank you for his 
efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry at large while he was us 
trade representative 
if he is confirmed as secretary of agriculture as expected he 
will oversee an agency whose policies directly affect philip morris 
business interests 
donald e campbell deputy director of the office of government 
ethics told of the situation but not yeutters name or the specific 
executive posts said ive got problems with that the 
newspaper said 
then told who it was who had accepted his hospitality from a 
major corporation with whom he did business as a government 
official campbell said yeutter should have sought an opinion from 
his agency ethics officer the post said

the patient with the bug in her ear screamed get 
that sucker that rang a bell for her doctors who failed to nab 
the critter with had been considered the best roach approach 
the doctors were excited when the woman came to the hospital with 
a cockroach in her ear it was their longawaited chance to try out 
a squirt of the anesthetic lidocaine which a report four years ago 
said was the best way to remove a bug from an ear 
with hurried anticipation we sprayed the drug briskly into the 
ear canal and quickly jumped back fully expecting the beast to come 
hurtling forth at first contact with the noxious substance they 
told their colleagues in a letter in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
alas nothing happened they tried again this time dousing the 
intruder with a bigger dose still nothing 
get that sucker outa my ear the patient screamed 
what a brilliant idea the doctors agreed 
they hooked up a wall suction device and gently slipped the tip 
into the young womens ear with a satisfying schloop they 
nabbed the roach 
got him the doctors wrote sure enough there he was 
plastered to the suction tip like a fly to flypaper 
the doctors jonathan warren and leo c rotello of the state 
university of new york health science center in syracuse conclude 
with this advice for physicians faced with a stuck bug if all else

home pregnancy tests are frequently misinterpreted 
by ordinary people says a report that questions whether the kits 
should stay on the market even though they are accurate when 
interpreted by lab workers 
in a letter in todays new england journal of medicine drs 
jocelyn m hicks of childrens hospital in washington and mariet 
iosefsohn of george washington university said they asked 
secretaries clerks messengers and janitors to analyze 200 urine 
samples using two brands of home pregnancy kits ten percent of the 
results of one test and 13 percent of the results of the other were 
wrong 
however when a lab technician used the kits one was 100 percent 
accurate the other kit gave no false results although the results 
were indeterminate in four cases 
the researchers noted that the manufacturers claim the home kits 
are 90 percent accurate 
it seems clear from our observations that the discrepant 
results produced by laypersons were due more to difficulties in 
using the home test kits and interpreting results than to problems 
with the kits themselves they wrote

twenty offduty tallahassee police 
officers who celebrated ted bundys execution outside florida state 
prison jan 24 did not violate departmental conduct policies an 
internal investigation showed 
the investigation began after newspaper reports said a group of 
officers celebrated bundys death jan 24 by singing songs like on 
top of ol sparky at a gathering that had the spirit and alcohol 
of a tailgate party

but found that he was not acting maliciously when he told reporters 
and others that he was mel tucker tallahassees chief of police a 
spokesman said tuesday 
investigator ray crew said he thought the media overplayed the 
incident i dont think there was any malicious intent police 
officers are held to a higher standard of behavior and thats not 
always fair 
according to police spokesman phil kiracofe interviews with 
seven police officers and five civilian employees found that none of 
the officers at the prison near starke were intoxicated which would

a study today concludes that virtually all asthma 
attacks are triggered by allergies challenging a widely held belief 
experts have long believed that asthma attacks in children and 
young adults were usually caused by allergies while in grownups 
they were usually thought to have other causes 
the study based on tests of 2657 people suggests that all 
asthma victims have the allergic variety regardless of age 
this helps us to understand better why allergic and 
nonallergic asthma look so much the same said dr benjamin 
burrows its all the same disease 
burrows a researcher at the university of arizona college of 
medicine published his results in the new england journal of 
medicine 
his teams conclusions were based largely on measurements of an 
antibody called immunoglobulin e or ige which plays a key role in 
the allergic response that leads to asthma youngsters with asthma 
have high amounts of ige but these levels drop as people get older 
the study found that even though older asthmatics ige levels 
seem low compared to childrens they are still higher than those of 
grownups who are free of asthma the doctors concluded that because 
of the adults relatively high ige levels their asthma was caused 
by allergies 
they noted that routine skin tests that are used to pinpoint the 
cause of allergies frequently fail to show anything wrong burrows 
said this is probably because the tests do not include the specific 
substance called an allergen that is triggering the attacks 
the message is pretty simple said burrows for many years 
people thought there were two different kinds of asthma only one of 
which was an allergy problem even when its not easy to demonstrate 
what the allergen might be the immunoglobulin in the blood suggests 
that virtually all asthma has an allergic basis 
the finding if true may have little effect on how doctors deal 
with asthma since allergic and nonallergic asthma are usually 
treated with the same drugs

fish oils ability to lower the bodys production 
of two important substances that cause inflammation may explain why 
it sometimes seems to relieve arthritis and other diseases 
researchers reported today 
the researchers studied the effects in the blood when nine 
healthy people took 18 fish oil capsules a day for six weeks 
we found a very dramatic reduction in the ability of their 
white blood cells to make tumor necrosis factor and interleukin1 
said dr charles a dinarello who reported his study in the new 
england journal of medicine 
this is the first time that any dietary manipulation has been 
shown to change the production of these inflammatory compounds 
doctors have long noticed that eskimos and others who eat lots of 
oily ocean fish have less heart disease than other people they also 
are less likely to get arthritis juvenile diabetes and other 
diseases that involve overactive inflammatory responses 
some studies suggest that fish oil supplements can lower blood 
cholesterol protecting the arteries from damaging buildups 
dinarello a researcher at new england medical center in boston 
said the latest work implies that fish oil also protects the heart 
by reducing inflammation in the arteries that may lead to thickening 
of the artery walls 
ten weeks after they stopped taking fish oil the volunteers 
production of interleukin1 had fallen 61 percent and tumor necrosis 
factor had dropped 40 percent 
dinarello cautioned that the study did not include a comparison 
group and said other kinds of oil supplements could have similar 
effects 
while tumor necrosis factor was first noticed for its ability to 
shrink tumors doctors believe its most important role in the body 
is causing inflammation in response to injury 
tumor necrosis factor has failed to work as a cancer treatment 
and dinarello said there is no evidence that reducing its levels in 
the body would increase susceptibility to cancer

in a washington courtroom a judge is looking 
for that rarest of creatures the person who barely knows anything 
about oliver north 
the judge selecting jurors to try north is making some progress 
but the question arises will the jury that results be a 
crosssection of the community capable of rendering an informed 
judgment 
in the legal sense it will be a jury of norths peers the law 
only requires that it be a crosssection of citizens from which no 
one has been excluded by reason of sex race or other arbitrary 
criteria it need not be people comparable to north in any other way 
what judge gerhard a gesell seeks is a jury ignorant of 
norths activities people so removed from world affairs during the 
summer of 1987 that they were unaware that north told congress he 
had lied to it believing his duty to his country required such 
deception 
such searches are conducted to ensure that jurors do not enter a 
case prejudiced either for or against a defendant but in norths 
case it means the exclusion of an enormous number of potential 
jurors who at one point or another read or heard something about 
him 
sen howell heflin dala who served on the irancontra 
committee and is a former state judge said the exclusion of 
knowledgeable people as jurors has inherent problems in it and 
raises real questions but he doesnt know the answers 
he said some people simply dont watch television out of choice 
or because they are too busy on the other hand you have the 
chance they didnt have any interest and you would think theyre 
lacking in the necessary intelligence to serve on it he said 
whether they will differ from normal average jurors remains to 
be seen he said if a man never saw anything of it what type 
of individual is he 
others go further bill moffitt a wellknown criminal defense 
lawyer questions whether a fair verdict can be rendered by people 
who knew nothing about the irancontra affair before stepping into 
gesells courtroom 
i wouldnt want people who lived in washington the seat of 
government on that jury who were so uninformed said moffitt 
are they going to be interested in what goes on inside the 
courtroom if they were so uninterested for so long on what went on 
outside it 
moffitt said justice would be better served if six of the jurors 
could be drawn from the uninformed and six from those who followed 
the irancontra affair though he concedes that is not practical 
on the other hand say some legal experts the jury system works 
well even with jurors who for whatever reason arrive innocent of 
knowledge of the case 
jurors are asked to bring a certain common sense into the jury 
room and try to determine whether a particular story makes sense and 
look witnesses in the eye to tell who is telling the truth said 
philip lacovara a former prosecutor in the watergate trial another 
case drenched in publicity before it reached trial 
it is not necessary for people to be highly educated or current 
in world affairs to make that assessment lacovara said 
its a burden to find qualified jurors but im not saying it 
cant be done added wayne lafave a criminal law expert at the 
university of illinois 
dont forget that all the pretrial publicity hasnt been 
unfavorable added neal sonnett of miami presidentelect of the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers dont forget the 
movement to pardon north not many people facing serious felony 
charges are asked to speak in support of the reelection of members 
of congress so the government has to be as careful about prejudiced 
jurors as the defense 
the jurys ignorance of norths activities is crucial because he 
was compelled to talk to congress irancontra committees in 
exchange he was given limited immunity a promise that his 
testimony would not be used against him in court 
prosecutors developed their case independently and charged north 
with obstructing presidential and congressional inquiries lying to 
congress and shredding evidence 
for all the attention focused on north gesell before the trial 
started expressed confidence that an unknowing jury could be found 
to hear the facts and draw its own conclusions 
he said the same questions were raised in the watergate case but 
a jury was found a verdict was rendered and justice was done

love is in the air at two zoos where 
scientists hope the worlds last 28 california condors will mate 
themselves away from the brink of extinction a biologist says 
meanwhile one of seven andean condors freed into the wilderness 
chickened out of a dogfight with two golden eagles half her size 
weve got all sorts of great things happening with the andeans 
and some equally exciting things happening with the captive 
california condors were very encouraged joseph dowhan us 
fish and wildlife service condor recovery coordinator said 
wednesday 
only 28 endangered california condors remain 14 in captivity at 
the los angeles zoo and 14 others at the san diego wild animal park 
in escondido scientists hope the vulturelike creatures which are 
north americas largest land birds with 9foot wingspans will 
reproduce enough so that some can be returned to the wild in five to 
10 years 
courtship started in early january among four pairs of the birds 
at escondido and two pairs in los angeles dowhan said during a 
phone interview from his office in ventura 
one of the courting pairs in escondido male condor ac4 and 
female un1 started mating early in january he added last april 
the same pair produced a female chick named molloko the first 
california condor conceived and hatched in captivity 
scientists believe condors lay eggs 30 to 35 days after 
fertilization but mating doesnt necessarily result in 
fertilization dowhan said 
the seven andean condors donated by zoos across the nation were 
freed into rugged mountains 50 miles northwest of los angeles in an 
experiment meant to help biologists learn the best way to handle 
release and monitor california condors once they reproduce in 
adequate numbers about 1000 to 2000 of the wild andean birds 
remain in south america 
the most recent release was jan 21 when biologists removed 
netting from a roost box and feeding platform that housed four 
andean condors in the sespe condor sanctuary 
on the same day a hostile encounter occurred between two golden 
eagles and one of three other andeans which had been freed dec 17 
from the nearby hopper mountain national wildlife refuge dowhan 
said 
the 10monthold andean condor y1 flew from hopper mountain 
onto the eagles turf where the eagles made several stoops or 
aggressive drives toward the condor and forced it to the ground 
said a fish and wildlife service news release 
dowhan said the condor soon returned to the air and made a 
beeline to the security of its home roost box it was intimidated 
by the eagles which have 5foot wingspans 
the andean condors which will be recaptured and rereleased in 
south america when the experiment ends next year will encounter a 
number of other birds in californias mountains and recognize some 
will be territorial and others may serve as pilots to where food is 
present he said 
there hasnt been much flight activity among the four andeans 
released jan 21 dowhan said 
condor r4 immediately flew 120 feet into a brushy thicket and 
couldnt figure out how to get back to her roost box biologists 
caught her tuesday and returned her to the box where dowhan said 
she ate right away carcasses of stillborn calves 
dowhan said it will be months before the biologists place food 
for the carrioneating condors away from their roost boxes in an 
effort to teach them to forage 
two of the three andeans freed from hopper mountain in december 
flew about three miles on tuesday and passed over the sespe roost 
box but the four condors there didnt notice them they were 
sleeping dowhan said 
back at the zoos the six males court the females by arching 
their necks looking at the ground and trying to encircle the 
females with their outstretched wings dowhan said each female 
will try to come up under the male and nibble at his beak thats 
a positive reaction 
dowhan said the breeding season runs from january to april

scientists say they are certain that a natural 
poison caused the massive dieoff of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and 
1988 but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly 
red tide that arose in the gulf of mexico and moved up the east 
coast 
we have never found this before in history said joseph 
geraci a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federal 
researchers 
speaking at a news conference wednesday geraci said laboratory 
findings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fish 
contaminated with a powerful poison called brevertoxin originating 
from the persistent bloom of red tide algae 
gerald scott a federal fisheries expert estimated that 50 
percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed and said 
it could take 100 years for their numbers to recover 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration officials 
said laboratory findings are unequivocal about the cause of 
death but just why the red tide made its rare and lethal invasion 
of the east coast is not known 
fisheries expert ford cross said red tides occur naturally but 
are normally confined to the gulf of mexico where they arise and 
decline swiftly but the 1987 red tide persisted for months moved 
with the gulf current from the west coast of florida and then was 
driven northward along the east coast 
cross said satellite photographs show that eddies of warm water 
lingered for long periods off the coast of north carolina and 
neighboring states and that this may have enabled the algae to 
continue blooming occasionally he said the eddies would be shoved 
into coastal bays bringing toxincontaminated fish into dolphin 
feeding grounds 
a red tide is considered dangerous for oyster fishing in the gulf 
if the count of cells reaches 5000 per liter of water cross said 
during the time the dolphins were dying he said some tests along 
the north carolina coast found cell counts of more than 20 million 
per liter 
bottlenose dolphins are mammals that live in the water they 
breathe air give birth to live young and nurse their calves the 
animal is highly intelligent and is popular in marine shows because 
it is easily trained and is longlived 
during the summer of 1987 hundreds of dead and dying dolphins 
washed onto beaches on the east coast from florida to new jersey 
the massive dieoff alarmed officials and led to the formation of an 
investigative team of more than 100 scientists from several federal 
agencies 
geraci said it took the team 18 months and thousands of 
laboratory tests to confirm that red tide toxin killed the animals 
the dolphins said geraci either died as a direct consequence 
of the toxin or were poisoned by it and lived long enough to 
become weakened and susceptible to other organisms such as 
bacteria and viruses 
scott said the poison seemed to affect younger dolphins aged 3 
to 6 years more than others some nursing calves died from their 
mothers toxinpoisoned milk scott said that though only 742 
dolphin bodies were found along the beaches it is likely that 
hundreds upon hundreds of others died unseen just offshore 
the population was reduced on the order of 50 percent said 
scott the recovery to the original stock levels could take from 
14 to 100 years

the local us attorney and the justice 
department appear at odds over how to proceed with a cornell 
university graduate student suspected of creating a virus that 
paralyzed 6000 computers nationwide 
the difference has to do with whether robert t morris jr 23 
should be charged with a felony to deter similar computer attacks 
or whether he should be offered a plea bargain and provide 
information under a grant of immunity 
us attorney frederick j scullin in syracuse ny has 
requested justice department approval to offer morris the chance to 
plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge and has granted him limited 
immunity a justice department source said wednesday confirming a 
report in the new york times 
the limited immunity grant caused a lot of consternation down 
here said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
under the computer fraud and abuse act of 1986 unlawful access 
to a government computer can result in a maximum penalty of a year 
in jail and a 250000 fine if fraud is proved the punishment can 
reach a maximum of 20 years in prison 
as far as were concerned the legal problem was still 
intent the source said he added that the officials were 
uncertain whether morris had planned to create and spread the virus 
last november that infected a government computer network a 
computer virus is a tiny program that spreads throughout computer 
networks and disrupts their normal operation 
morris who is on a leave of absence from cornell and living with 
his parents in arnold md has told friends that he created the 
virus but didnt intend for it to invade computers around the nation 
the virus that began nov 2 1988 infected 6000 university and 
military computers nationwide connected by the arpanet network 
which is used for transmission of nonclassified data among 
universities and military contractors the system was virtually shut 
down for several days but no information was destroyed 
arpanet is part of internet which has another network called 
milnet used by military facilities 
the justice department official who is considering what charges 
should be brought mark m richard referred questions to the fbi 
an fbi spokesman declined to discuss the case because it is an 
ongoing investigation 
the justice department source said he understood the fbi which 
enforces the computer fraud and abuse act was extremely upset over 
the limited immunity grant to morris 
scullin was out of his office wednesday afternoon and not 
available for comment his secretary said 
the matter is still pending before the department said 
department spokesman john russell 
thomas guidoboni the washington attorney for morris said no 
plea bargain had been worked out 
they have not told me what theyve recommended and ive not 
offered on behalf of my client to plead guilty to anything he 
said i have told them we wont plead guilty to a felony im very 
emphatic about that 
he refused to confirm or deny that morris had spoken with 
prosecutors 
phone calls wednesday to the morris home in maryland went 
unanswered morris father robert t morris sr chief computer 
scientist for the national computer security center near baltimore 
did not immediately return a phone call to his office 
guidoboni said morris is on a yearlong leave of absence from 
cornell where he was a graduate student in computer science 
hes doing as well as can be expected under the 
circumstances he said noting that morris has a temporary job but 
would like to get the case resolved 
guidoboni said he didnt know if the temporary job involved work 
with computers

the congressional budget office says former 
president reagans last budget would produce a deficit far larger 
than the law allows and would not produce a surplus by 1993 as the 
white house has claimed 
using gloomier economic projections than those employed by the 
administration the nonpartisan cbo said wednesday that reagans 
spending plan would create a 120 billion shortfall in fiscal 1990 
which begins oct 1 and leave 80 billion in red ink by 1993 
reagan projected a 925 billion imbalance for next year and a 2 
billion surplus in 1993 the year the grammrudman deficit reduction 
law requires a balanced budget 
grammrudman sets a 100 billion deficit limit for 1990 if 
congress and the president fail to whittle the deficit to within 10 
billion of that amount automatic spending cuts occur that reduce 
the imbalance to 100 billion 
president bush has said he will submit his budget plan a week 
from today and his blueprint not reagans will dominate this 
years budget battles between the white house and congress 
but reagans proposal and cbos examination of it retains 
some significance for two reasons 
first of all bush aides have said they are likely to use the 
economic forecasts used by reagan projections that many private 
economists and congressional fiscal experts say are too optimistic 
cbos report shows just how far apart bush and his congressional 
foes are likely to be when the debate begins over needed savings 
secondly bush will incorporate large chunks of reagans proposal 
in his own plan 
cbo also said that 
this years budget deficit will be 159 billion about 2 
billion lower than the administration projects cbo had projected 
the 1989 deficit at 155 billion just last month but increased that 
figure based on expectations of higher spending for agriculture 
housing and the savings and loan crisis 
if none of reagans proposals is adopted next years deficit 
would be 146 billion 5 billion more than the office projected 
last month and would shrink only slightly to 135 billion by 1993 
the administration has said the deficit without reagans proposed 
savings would be 127 billion next year and 37 billion in 1993 
the government would spend 119 trillion next year under 
reagans plan 38 billion more than the administration estimated 
the government will collect 11 billion more in revenues than 
the 1059 trillion estimated by the white house 
the cost of bailing out the nations financially ailing savings 
and loan associations will cost 11 billion more next year than the 
administration estimated 
the cbo figures are often used by members of congress to argue 
that the administration deficit forecast is too optimistic and that 
more savings are needed nonetheless the grammrudman law requires 
the use of the administrations figures when calculating the 
deficit congress in recent years has ultimately accepted the 
administrations figures thus making it easier to create savings 
the administration has forecast that the economy will grow at a 
rate of 32 percent this calendar year that inflation will be 38 
percent and that shortterm interest rates will drop to 63 percent 
two points below current interest rates 
cbo used a forecast that included 29 percent growth for the 
economy an inflation rate of 49 percent and 79 percent shortterm 
interest rates

some backers of the 50 percent pay raise for 
members of congress say they need it because washington is such an 
expensive place lucky for them the capitol isnt in boston or san 
francisco or anaheim calif 
all of those places are even more expensive than washington 
according to various private studies that index the cost of living 
in cities around the country 
members of congress currently are paid 89500 a year except for 
congressional leaders who earn more if the proposed pay raise goes 
through their pay will jump 50 percent to 135000 
many argue that the costs of keeping up homes back in their 
district and in the capitol strain their budgets but they also 
argue that just living in the district of columbia or its virginia 
or maryland suburbs is a strain too 
whether they shouldnt have to make do is another question but 
they do get some private support for their argument that the city is 
among the most expensive places in the nation to live 
the american chamber of commerce reserachers association which 
produces quarterly cost comparisons for 263 urban areas puts 
washington at close to the top with above standard costs in all 
categories including housing groceries utilities transportation 
health care and miscellaneous goods and services 
the chambers report for the third quarter of 1988 the most 
recent available established a composite index of 1272 for 
washington based on a scale with 100 the nationwide average thus 
they rate washington 27 percent more expensive than average 
among the big cities boston was rated the highest at 1641 
followed by san francisco at 1447 and philadelphia at 1277 los 
angeles was just behind at 1239 anaheim and santa ana calif in 
orange county were just ahead of washington at 1292 
the biggest item in washington is housing which the chamber says 
is 68 percent higher than average in boston its 225 percent higher 
than average 
there are private companies that make their own cost calculations 
and make recommendations to businesses on salaries when moving 
employees or setting pay for different cities one of them 
runzheimer international a management consulting firm based in 
rochester wis made such a comparison for congressional salaries 
it established a basic mean for expenses in the country and 
called it standard city usa if a person there with a family of 
four was earning 89500 and then got elected to congress and moved 
to washington runzheimer figures he or she would need to earn 
101681 to maintain the same standard of living thats 14 percent 
more 
if the same family had moved to new york city runzheimer figures 
it would need 115296 or 29 percent more for san francisco it 
would need 117625 or 31 percent more 
thats to continue the same lifestyle he would have to live in 
the same size house drive the same car have the same expenditure 
pattern said dennis taylor director of consulting services for 
the company 
still another way to compare would be to look at the costs of 
homes the biggest budget item for most families the national 
association of realtors figures for the third quarter of 1988 
showed the median price for existing singlefamily homes in the 
washington area was 135800 above the national median of 90200 
washington was ninth on the realtors list of housing prices 
behind orange county honolulu san francisco new york los 
angeles boston hartford conn and san diego it was among the 
most rapidly escalating in costs too with that median home price 
up more than 15 percent in one year

when fran solomon blows her whistle bank 
presidents stand on chairs attorneys howl and nurses roar like 
lions blow passionate kisses and shoot the air with their fingers 
like gunslingers 
solomon a registered nurse from berkeley calif is a humor 
consultant whose mission is to rid the world of boredom and help 
employees lighten up and enjoy their work 
inside the crankiest grumpiest grouchiest person you know is 
a child whos dying to get out and enjoy himself solomon said 
wednesday at a seminar for nurses at a nursing home in this 
pittsburgh suburb 
were not proposing people tell jokes at work or create a 
circus she said but we are proposing that people have an 
opportunity to express all that they are from tears to laughters 
the whole spectrum of feeling 
solomon spreads her gospel of humor in lectures conferences and 
workshops and has looked for the funny bone in such unlikely places 
as the army and atampt 
acting more like a standup comic than a consultant wednesday 
solomon prodded her audience of 100 nurses and other healthcare 
professionals into acting silly she encouraged them to seek support 
by asking for a standing ovation or express boredom by making a sign 
that looked a lot like someone picking their nose 
solomon said she knows many people may feel this overwhelming 
urge to bolt for the door when she requests particularly unusual 
behavior so she doesnt require a response few people however 
just sat back and watched 
i set up ground rules for people where they only do what feels 
safe to them she said 
as she bounced from one routine to the next trading one goofy 
mask for another solomon cited research that indicates humor can 
help in the healing process while stress can delay recovery 
the prediction is that by the year 2000 80 percent of 
workmens compensation claims will be stress related she said 
we need to find a new way of doing business in this country 
that supports people being whole healthy happy satisfied so that 
they come to work and find they really have an opportunity to 
express themselves to impact the world to make a difference and 
humor is a part of that 
research supports the theory that laughter is important for good 
health laughter releases endorphins which are natural painkillers 
and help the body deal with stress 
recent studies show that people who can laugh it up under 
pressure seem to have greater resistance to stressrelated ailments 
and that humor therapy helps relieve painful musclebone disorders 
and depression 
a good hearty laugh provides a miniworkout by exercising the 
diaphragm thorax abdomen heart and lungs 
solomon suggested nurses try a little humor on the job taking 
vital signs while wearing a clown nose or writing with a pen shaped 
like an eggplant can bring a smile to most peoples faces she said 
patients love it walk into a patients room and tell a joke 
and everyone in all the beds will be paying attention even the 
person who is hearing impaired she said with a laugh everyone 
wants to get into the act 
im not ready to walk into a patients room with a clown nose 
but i think she reminded us that we need to lighten up said 
connie mccormick a nurse from suburban dormont

last summers devastating heat and drought 
shriveled crop production but in some cases market prices rose 
enough to offset much of the financial loss according to 
agriculture department analysts 
in the case of 1988 corn production for example the harvest 
dropped 30 percent to 492 billion bushels the average yield was 
cut to 846 bushels per acre from the record of 1194 bushels in 
1987 
but the corn crop nationally was worth more than 13 billion 
down only about 7 percent from its value in 1987 of slightly less 
than 14 billion 
its a bigstakes numbers game of course with losers and 
winners a farmer who was wiped out entirely had no corn to sell at 
the higher prices but many did have something to sell and thats 
what usdas national figures are about averages and how those 
stack up from one year to the next 
the departments national agricultural statistics service 
reported on tuesday that the 13 billion corn harvest of 1988 was 
valued at 260 per bushel compared with 194 for the 1987 crop 
analysts cautioned that the prices used in the report are based 
on preliminary averages during the marketing year and dont take 
into account usda price supports and other benefits 
moreover the value of a crop is basically determined by 
multiplying production by price it is not the same as cash sales by 
farmers for example if a farmer had a 100000bushel corn crop and 
fed part or all of it to livestock the corn would still have a 
production value whether used or sold 
overall the report showed that major crops in 1988 had a 
production value of 702 billion up from 685 billion in 1987 a 
dozen carried a production value last year of 1 billion or more 
accounting for more than 80 percent of the total 
rounded off those included corn 13 billion soybeans 119 
billion hay 106 billion wheat 663 billion cotton 41 
billion tobacco 22 billion potatoes 192 billion oranges 
169 billion grapes 137 billion sorghum 136 billion 
apples 122 billion and rice 104 billion 
other examples of 1988 production values included oats 5623 
million down from 606 million in 1987 barley 790295 down from 
9823 million and dry edible beans 571 million up from 4264 
million 
some drought states declined in crop production value much more 
than others last year iowa for example was reported at 481 
billion for 1988 down only 2 percent from 489 billion in 1987 
north dakota severely hit by drought was shown at 12 billion 
down from 193 billion in 1987 a 37 percent drop 
nebraska showed an increase in crop production value to nearly 
37 billion from less than 29 billion in 1987 
by states here are the comparisons of total crop production 
values in thousands of dollars alaska was not listed the first 
column is for 1987 and the second column is for 1988

if you didnt know that today is national no 
talk day youre not alone the thirdgrade teacher who founded the 
holiday doesnt talk much about it 
marilyn bachelor came up with the idea for the annual bit of 
peace and quiet 13 years ago 
it was a dull time and i wanted to do something to bring my 
students to life to give them a challenge she recalled so she 
told her class at garner elementary school to write notes and play 
charades for one entire day except during recess 
celebrated on the first thursday in february the holiday is 
likely to be overshadowed this year by a betterknown holiday 
groundhog day 
but no talk day probably would be unheard of outside bachelors 
classroom were it not for chases annual events a reference book 
that keeps track of thousands of holidays including oddball events 
such as no talk day 
one of bachelors students about four years ago was a grandson of 
william and helen chase the books founders who agreed to add 
national no talk day to the likes of national blame someone else day 
and national goof off day

a proposed joint operating agreement between 
detroits two major newspapers raises issues so significant they 
deserve another hearing on appeal says a motion filed by a 
coalition of readers and advertisers to delay the deal 
the motion filed wednesday by the michigan citizens for an 
independent press says the 100year agreement between the detroit 
news and detroit free press would cost 500 jobs cause higher 
subscription and newsstand prices and probably lead to higher 
advertising rates 
for their part the two newspapers would suffer comparatively 
little harm should the agreement to combine business and 
production operations be put off past the scheduled monday 
completion of the agreement opponents said in their motion 
under the agreement the papers would maintain separate news and 
editorial departments 
a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the district 
of columbia circuit on friday rejected opponents argument that the 
partial merger should be forbidden 
the court said the attorney general had the power to interpret 
the newspaper preservation act the law under which the newspapers 
applied for an exemption from federal antitrust laws 
the opponents argued that the appeals panel gave the attorney 
general undue power 
knightridder inc owner of the free press said through a 
spokesman that the delay is costing about 50000 a day gannett co 
inc owner of the news declined comment from its arlington va 
headquarters

as the chief us diplomat for central american affairs shows the 
desire of the bush administration to forge a bipartisan policy in 
that region us officials say 
bernard aronson a democrat and onetime aide to former vice 
president walter mondale is best known for helping president reagan 
build congressional support for military aid for the contras in the 
summer of 1986 it was the last time such aid won approval on 
capitol hill 
although early signs are that bush will not seek a renewal of 
contra aid and instead will seek a diplomatic solution in central 
america aronson is viewed on capitol hill as a moderate who could 
appeal to members of both parties 
the anticipated appointment of aronson comes at a time when both 
the united states and nicaraguas leftist government are showing 
signs of interest in a more accommodating relationship possibly 
including the first direct us discussions with the sandinistas in 
four years 
secretary of state james a baker iii had considered a long list 
of alternate candidates for the post before settling on aronson to 
become assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
widely regarded as one of the most demanding jobs in government 
the selection of aronson indicates that bush and baker are intent 
on avoiding the kind of friction with congress that accompanied the 
reagan administrations support of the contra rebels 
baker has indicated that he believes the reagan administrations 
inability to come up with a central america policy acceptable to 
congress was a major contributing factor to us inability to 
achieve its objectives in that region 
he has been engaged in consultations with the congress and has 
elicited favorable comments from house speaker jim wright dtex 
who helped engineer the defeat of the contra aid request a year ago 
former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams has called 
that vote perhaps his biggest disappointment in 3 years as reagans 
top aide for latin america 
he maintains that the sandinista government responded to the vote 
by increasing repression accelerating aid to leftist rebels in el 
salvador and continuing to accept disproportionately high levels of 
military aid from the soviet union he lists the 1988 kremlin aid 
figure at 500 million 
one longtime contra aid opponent rep david bonior dmich 
said he is cautiously optimistic he will be able to work well with 
aronson 
aronson from 1977 to 1981 was a vice presidential speechwriter 
and deputy assistant to president carter and currently is on a 
council on foreign relations study group on central america the 
officials who confirmed his appointment spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
reagans departure appears to have had a dramatic impact on 
sandinista attitudes including its policy towards washington 
the sandinistas announced on inauguration day that the state 
department will be allowed to send envoys to replace eight us 
diplomats who were expelled from managua last july 
president daniel ortega said last week he wants to normalize 
all aspects of usnicaraguan relations and he also has 
announced cutbacks in military spending a sore point for the reagan 
administration for years contra fighters many of whom are 
languishing at camps inside honduras will be welcomed home without 
conditions he said 
on tuesday the sandinistas extended a unilateral ceasefire with 
the contras and lifted suspensions on two radio programs that had 
been in effect since last fall and drawn critical state department 
comment 
bush meanwhile has said little about nicaragua since he began 
his election campaign last year leaving the impression that he does 
not subscribe to reagans view that the sandinista government left 
unchecked will eventually represent a major security threat to the 
united states

leading southern democrats are lining up to 
help ronald h brown counter complaints about his liberal ties and 
smooth his transition to the chairmanship of the democratic party 
govs ray mabus of mississippi and bill clinton of arkansas 
planned to greet brown as he opened a twoday swing through the 
region where his links to edward m kennedy and jesse jackson 
produced the most objections from conservative democrats 
an associated press survey of elected and party officials around 
the country found strong support for brown coupled with advice that 
he quickly establish his independence and demonstrate a commitment 
to keep the party in the political mainstream 
browns four rivals for the party chairmanship have dropped out 
of the race leaving him a sure winner when the democratic national 
committee elects a successor to paul g kirk jr on feb 10 
hes a terrific guy and will do a great job said gov james 
blanchard of michigan but blanchard also suggested that the task 
ahead for brown will not be easy 
i just think the party is in more difficult shape than it has 
admitted nationally he said i think the general drift of the 
democratic party since the mid 60s has been downward nationwide i 
think that large numbers of people are feeling that in the national 
scheme of things were not speaking to them 
while democrats control the house and senate and hold a majority 
of the nations governorships they have lost five of the last six 
presidential elections southern states have voted solidly 
republican in recent presidential contests 
if we want to win we have to bring the socalled reagan 
democrats home said john henry anderson the georgia democratic 
party chairman he called brown jacksons man but said the 
incoming party chairman will demonstrate his independence if he 
works hard to find a presidential candidate who appeals to moderate 
and conservative democrats 
he was not my choice said anderson but i look forward to 
working with him 
louisiana sen john breaux urged brown to appoint a task force to 
address the concerns of party moderates 
i think we should give him a chance to address the concerns of 
those who are out there said breaux who is chairman of the 
senate democratic campaign committee if he doesnt thenhell be 
open to criticism 
brown was jacksons convention manager last summer and received 
credit for helping bring the session to a harmonious close he was 
general counsel to the senate judiciary committee when kennedy was 
chairman and then served as deputy manager of the massachusetts 
senators 1980 presidential campaign 
browns ties to jackson and kennedy triggered suggestions he 
would make it more difficult for democrats to shake an image that 
the party was too liberal 
his ideology as far as im concerned is insignificant said 
mark schreiber executive director of the pennsylvania democratic 
party his task is simply to get in there and get the party 
organized his role is to build an organization that can win 
elections 
i dont know ron brown said r clayton mitchell speaker of 
the maryland house of delegates but people ive talked to are 
concerned it might hurt us mitchell said there is a conservative 
trend in the country and a lot of people are concerned were 
moving away from the national trend 
in new york talk of browns liberalism wasnt an issue 
that question might be better asked of whites in texas said 
lee miringoff director of the nonpartisan marist college institute 
of public opinion 
bob slagle texas democratic party chairman said the identity of 
the national chairman has damned little to do with the state 
party 
paul wellstone who was a leader of the jackson campaign in 
minnesota said the fact brown is black is an issue for many 
people in the country race is a huge factor in american 
politics more than most of us want to admit to the sooner the 
democratic party confronts it the better off we are 
its a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman 
said john marino executive director of the new york democratic 
party thats because we dont look at ron brown as simply being 
black we look upon him as someone who can unite all democrats and 
put it together

the national transportation safety board says 
cocaine use by the pilot of a colorado commuter flight contributed 
to a crash that killed nine people 
the fivemember board reached the conclusion after a years 
investigation into the jan 19 1988 crash of a transcolorado 
flight into durango colo in which the pilot copilot and seven 
passengers died eight passengers survived 
the decision came even though investigators said the cocaine 
found in pilot stephen silvers blood and urine was insufficient to 
make him high during the flight and copilot ralph d hardy was 
controlling the fairchild metro 3 aircraft before it crashed into a 
hill five miles short of the durango runway 
contributing to the accident was the degradation of the 
captains performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the 
accident the board said it blamed both the first officers 
flying and the captains ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized 
approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent 
profile 
the board said the plane began its descent at too high an 
altitude and speed to land safely 
investigators found no problem with the aircraft or air traffic 
control instructions that might have contributed to the crash but 
raised some questions about the landing approach path the pilot 
chose to use 
the board asked the faa to examine procedures that approved the 
steep slamdunk approach used by the nowdefunct airline called 
for more faa assistance in screening of pilots and urged greater 
dissemination of information about detecting drug use among airline 
personnel 
the board opposes random drug testing of all airplane crew 
members as called for in a program set up by the federal aviation 
administration saying it prefers testing before employment after 
accidents and when warranted by a wide range of safety related 
errors 
investigators said silver 36 lied about previous drunken 
driving convictions to obtain a medical certification to fly and 
noted that copilot hardys record of training with transcolorado 
and previous employment indicated deficiences in performing 
instrument procedures 
the plane leased by continental express a subsidiary of 
continental airlines crashed at night in light snow 
the board staff also noted that hardy 42 had a history of 
alcoholism although no evidence of alcohol was found in either crew 
members body family members and friends said earlier that hardy 
had overcome his alcoholism 
the board in its conclusions and recommendations did not 
address drug testing but member jim burnett noted board 
disagreement with the faa program 
the program requires drug testing of all airplane crew members 
during first medical evaluations and random testing thereafter 
medical analysis after the colorado crash found traces of cocaine 
in the pilots blood and urine investigators said they also said a 
girlfriend of the pilot reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the 
night before the crash although she refused to talk to 
investigators 
board investigator barry strauch said evidence showed that silver 
had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight he said 
there was not enough evidence to determine whether silver was a 
heavy user of the drug 
board staff member merritt birky a chemical expert said that 
regular use of cocaine could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with 
cocaine affecting performance of a pilot long after any high 
two negligence lawsuits have been filed against continental 
airlines as a result of the crash both cites silvers cocaine use 
one also alleges that the airline failed to check records of both 
silver and harvey

growers who welcomed alar 20 years ago because 
it made apples firmer better looking and less likely to spoil will 
have to come up with a substitute because of concern the chemical 
causes cancer 
the environmental protection agency said wednesday it plans to 
order a ban on the chemical formally known as daminozide but that 
the regulatory process is likely to take 18 months or more the 
agency is meanwhile urging growers to voluntarily stop using the 
chemical 
according to current epa and industry estimates only about 5 
percent of the more than 200 million bushels of apples grown each 
year are sprayed with the chemical four years ago it was found on 
about 35 percent of the apple crop 
john moore acting epa administrator said the health risks of 
continued alar use have been calculated to produce an estimated five 
additional deaths from cancer over a lifetime for every 100000 
people exposed 
the risk for children is likely greater because they consume more 
apples and apple products such as juice or sauce he said 
there is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure 
and the development of lifethreatening tumors in test mice 
he continued citing preliminary results of a series of tests still 
under way 
the first indication from laboratory tests on animals that there 
might be a link to cancer came in l977 the epa said in the early 
l980s that it planned to review whether alar should be taken off the 
market finally directing a ban three years ago only to back off 
after its test data were brought into question 
in recent years many apple processors who provide apples for 
juices and sauces as well as baby food have refused to buy 
alartreated apples so have some grocery chains because of the 
health concern said derl derr president of the international apple 
institute 
alar which is absorbed into the apple began being used 
extensively by apple growers in the early l970s to spur even growth 
reduce spoilage and help preserve apples so they can be sold all 
year 
uniroyal chemical co of middlebury conn the only producer of 
alar disputes that a health risk has been proven all the studies 
that have been done since 1985 have supported our position that alar 
poses no significant health risk said uniroyal spokesman yanis 
bibelnieks he said it was inappropriate to make any judgment 
based on interim results cited by the epa and the company has no 
plans to take the produce off the market 
the company produces 75 percent less alar today than it did in 
l985 because fewer growers now use it he said 
a lawyer for the national research defense council which has 
filed a lawsuit to stop alars use criticized the epa for not 
taking emergency action to ban the product immediately 
epa has a sufficient amount of data to take this chemical off 
the market today said janet hathaway an attorney for the 
washingtonbased group its a very hazardous cancercausing 
chemical any further debate should occur in the courts after 
the product is off the market 
in washington state where a third of the countrys apples are 
grown industry representatives said many growers likely will stop 
for fear of future legal liabilies and a possible public backlash 
we know its a greast tool for us to use but by the same token 
if its going to hurt our image we dont need it said charles st 
john a spokesman for the washington apple commission

iran celebrated the 10th anniversary of 
its islamic revolution by marking the minute ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini arrived home from exile 
millions of the 88yearold leaders supporters cheered rang 
bells exploded fireworks at the appointed hour wednesday tehran 
radio said there were sports tournaments cultural festivals and 
street reenactments of revolutionary events 
the celebrations will climax feb 11 the anniversary of the day 
the last government formed by the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
collapsed and the revolutionaries took over to proclaim the islamic 
republic 
khomeini living at that time in paris returned to triumph in 
tehran 
but the festivities that began at 903 am wednesday to mark the 
minute khomeini touched iranian soil a decade earlier come at a 
deeply troubling time 
infighting between pragmatists in the tehran hierarchy and 
radicals has led to a wave of political executions and a bitter 
power struggle that is expected to flare when khomeini dies 
the nation also is struggling to recover from a devastating 
eightyear war with iraq which ended after a humiliating military 
collapse by iran that forced it to accept a ceasefire on aug 20 
irans failure to defeat iraq led some pragmatists to abandon the 
goal of exporting the islamic revolution to the moslem world through 
militant action 
it also led the moderates to call for less religious political 
and social restrictions and for normalization of relations with the 
west 
still the revolution has survived the internal upheaval the 
hostility of much of the world and the punishing war with iraq 
which left hundreds of thousands of iranians killed or mutilated 
this year we celebrate a decade of resistance and struggle 
against the enemies of humanity culture minister mohammad khatami 
said earlier this week we celebrate the 10th year of a revolution 
which has been strengthened by thousands of martyrs and thousands of 
disabled 
tehrans streets spruced up by teams of workers were decked out 
in iranian flags revolutionary posters and portraits of khomeini 
tehran radio did not say what khomeini was doing to mark the day 
of his triumphant return two weeks after the shah left tehran to go 
into exile his regime crumbling from within his army unable to 
quell the revolution 
the celebrations came as dissident factions claimed that 
parliament hashemi rafsanjani whose pragmatic faction holds the 
upper hand in the political struggle has been executing hundreds of 
opponents including supporters of ayatollah husseilali montazeri 
khomeinis designated successor and rafsanjanis rival 
the anniversary also comes as rafsanjani attempts to normalize 
irans relations with the west and the soviet bloc 
he said wednesday that tehran is ready to restore relations with 
saudi arabia which broke ties 10 months ago after accusing iran of 
subversion and terrorism

the proposal by president bush to cut the 
capitalgains tax could cause the 1986 tax overhaul to unravel a 
key architect of that legislation says 
i want to retain the 86 act because this is the first year the 
full force and effect of that legislation will take place rep 
dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
said wednesday 
if the capitalgains tax is reduced he suggested there is a 
real possibility that congress would couple it with an increase in 
the top individual tax rates 
that bothers me the illinois democrat said when a 
questioner at a meeting of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors asked about bushs proposal the president 
says he will ask congress to reduce the 33 percent top tax rate on 
capital gains to 15 percent 
that scares me rostenkowski said to applause from the 
audience he said his talks with business leaders make clear that 
the best thing to do with the tax law now is leave it alone 
rostenkowski was one of the chief authors of the 1986 tax 
overhaul which reduced tax rates significantly and cut or 
eliminated several deductions exclusions and credits among those 
changes was wiping out the preferential rate for capital gains 
which are profits from the sale of stocks real estate and other 
property

vice president salvador laurel said 
thursday he was leaving for hawaii for a meeting requested by 
deposed president ferdinand marcos who was in critical condition in 
a honolulu hospital 
marcos was very very weak and placed on a respirator 
wednesday after emergency surgery at st francis medical center 
said hospital spokeswoman norma kop 
but president corazon aquino gave no indication she was prepared 
to lift the ban against marcos returning from exile in hawaii and 
said the former presidents condition is neither critical nor 
serious 
laurel said in a statement that he had informed mrs aquino and 
executive secretary catalino macaraig of his trip and would 
immediately relay to her marcos message 
since marcos could not communicate directly with mrs aquino 
he is asking me to help communicate with the filipino people 
laurel said 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said laurel was acting on 
his own and not as an emissary of mrs aquino 
laurel said marcos wife imelda telephoned him from honolulu 
requesting the urgent meeting because doctors had advised marcos 
that he hasnt much time left to live 
mrs marcos 59 fainted while accompanying her husband to the 
emergency tracheotomy and fell and hit her head nursing supervisor 
cindy miller said she was listed in satisfactory condition in the 
same hospital 
laurels statement followed rumors in manila and in honolulu that 
he and filipino industrialist enrique zobel were trying to work out 
a deal under which marcos could be allowed to return 
if what marcos wants to convey to mrs aquino and the nation 
will heal the wounds that have been fragmenting our people and 
finally lead to national reconciliation then something good can 
come out of this trip laurel said 
a spokesman said the vice president whose relations with mrs 
aquino have been strained since he quit her cabinet in 1987 was to 
depart later thursday 
marcos has been living in exile since a february 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising ended his 20year rule and swept mrs 
aquino to power mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return 
for reasons of national security 
the 71yearold former president was admitted to the hospital on 
jan 15 for treatment of pneumonia and bronchial asthma in 
december he was hospitalized twice for treatment of congestive 
heart failure 
in october marcos and his wife were indicted by a federal grand 
jury in new york on racketeering charges for allegedly embezzling 
103 million from the philippine government to purchase real estate 
in new york 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent before a federal judge later that 
month but marcos arraignment has been postponed because of his 
health 
mrs aquinos government accuses the marcoses of robbing the 
country of up to 10 billion during their rule and demands the 
return of the illgotten wealth as a condition for allowing 
marcos return

the arctic air mass that created havoc in alaska 
before moving to the lower 48 froze fountains in usually mild 
vancouver as edmonton residents tried to dig out from under a foot 
of snow 
officials attributed at least 13 deaths to the cold and driving 
winds that have paralyzed much of western canada since monday 
cold and blowing snow was blamed for eight deaths in alberta 
three in saskatchewan and two in british columbia among the dead 
were six edmonton men who suffered heart attacks after shoveling or 
pushing vehicles 
the snow that fell monday and tuesday in the edmonton area was 
the heaviest january storm recorded there since jan 31 1885 
most roads and highways in alberta were open on wednesday 
although about 20000 residents in british columbias fraser valley 
were without power due to high winds that blew trees and branches 
onto the lines 
in victoria the fountain in front of the british columbia 
legislature was frozen solid as the mercury dipped to 10 degrees on 
the west coast 
temperatures remained around minus 22 on wednesday throughout 
saskatchewan and alberta where the windchill factor made it cold 
enough to freeze exposed flesh in less than a minute 
what has happened the last couple days is quite spectacular 
said andy radomski of the federal atmospheric environment service 
he said the air had a chance to cool longer than usual in the 
north because it was trapped by westerly circulation that kept most 
of canada warm much of the winter the upper level winds then 
shifted and forced the cold air south at last 
it has affected all of western canada and in fact is going to 
the states and will affect them as well radomski said in a 
telephone interview 
radomski said the weather pattern generally was heading south and 
southeast from western canada and was expected to hit hardest the 
plains the lower great lakes and new england 
the cold air that lingered over alaska for a week broke 
temperature records and resulted in at least one death 
on monday it was 51 below zero in fairbanks alaska and the 
national weather service said there were unofficial reports of 
temperatures of minus 75 in the state

general motors corp will shut its 
framingham auto assembly plant in august for an indefinite period 
and lay off about 2000 workers because it has not decided what cars 
or trucks to make at the facility 
gov michael s dukakis planned to go to the plant today to 
assure employees he will work to reduce the uncertainty associated 
with layoffs 
gm officials announced wednesday that they would be stopping 
production at the plant which makes the buick century and 
oldsmobile cutlass ciera about 300 cars a day 
there is no product allocated to the framingham facility after 
we build out the 89 model said ed dilworth a spokesman for the 
automaker 
a government official speaking on condition on anonymity told 
the associated press that dukakis may request federal aid for the 
workers and hoped to set up meetings with gm to discuss longterm 
plans for the plant 
dukakis has had some success with gm before when he returned to 
office in 1983 the plant was closed but after negotiations between 
the state the uaw and gm officials the plant reopened later that 
year 
it closed again in november 1987 and reopened last may it 
currently has 2100 active employees 
j russell mccarthy plant manager said a transition program 
will be developed for plant employees to provide them with benefits 
information and counseling 
dee allen a plant spokesman said between 100 and 200 employees 
will remain on the payroll in framingham after august to handle 
security staff the fire brigade and administer employee benefit and 
placement programs framingham is about 30 miles west of boston 
well be working with people to find them jobs both within gm 
and even outside of general motors he said 
allen also stressed that the company wanted to make the 
distinction between closing a plant and idling it 
the difference is that were going to leave the facility in a 
condition that it can be run if a new product is allocated to 
framingham he said 
walter tremblay a trustee of the local united auto workers said 
most employees took the news calmly 
if youve been with the auto industry any amount of time you 
believe something like this when it happens he said i know 
what they told us but what could actually happen come july or 
august could be subject to change between now and then 
the newer people naturally are more concerned which they have 
a right to be you tend to worry a little more tremblay said 
most of your seniority people have been through this before so 
theyve more or less adjusted their lives around it

in a joint venture unprecedented for 
the divided korean peninsula the souths hyundai conglomerate has 
signed agreements to develop a tourist resort shipyard and railroad 
plant in the communist north 
the agreement between the sometimes bitter rivals reported by 
north koreas media on wednesday is considered a business deal with 
political connotations because it is still technically at war with 
south korea 
the countries have no official ties 
south korean tycoon chung juyung hyundais honorary chairman 
confirmed today after returning from a 10day trip to north korea 
that he had agreed in principle with the north to undertake the 
projects along its east coast 
he was the first south korean business leader known to have 
visited the north with the approval of both governments since korea 
was split in 1945 the koreas went to war in the early 1950s and 
have long remained at odds 
under the agreement signed in the norths capital pyongyang 
hyundai and the north korean government will jointly develop a 
resort around scenic mount kumgang to attract south koreans and 
foreigners chung said 
the mount kumgang area known for its beauty is about 20 miles 
from the demilitarized zone that divides the koreas 
chung told a brief airport news conference that the two sides 
also agreed to jointly develop resources in siberia and to jointly 
operate a railroad rolling stock plant and a shipyard both at 
wonsan in the north he had already discussed the siberian projects 
with soviet officials in moscow 
the agreement in the form of a protocol was signed by chung and 
choe su gil director of north koreas taesong bank and consultant 
to the korean association of the promotion of asian trade because 
both are state agencies the pyongyang governments approval of the 
projects was seen as guaranteed 
while chung said the projects are subject to approval form both 
governments one seoul official said the south would approve the 
undertakings as a sort of pilot project to stimulate interkorean 
cooperation 
seoul has been seeking direct trade and other exchanges to ease 
tension between the two koreas with an eventual goal of 
reunification both koreas recently have made contacts to arrange 
highlevel government and parliamentary talks to pave the way for 
peace 
some observers said the communist north known for its 
reclusiveness now appears ready for deals with the capitalist south 
to overcome its economic backwardness some see this venture as a 
way for north korea to attract scarce foreign currency 
chung said he and a 20member survey team would visit north korea 
in midapril to discuss financing and other details for the resort 
project 
he said he would be allowed to enter the north through the 
demilitarized zone a route previously permitted only for a few 
exchanges of official delegations for northsouth talks in the 1970s 
and early 1980s 
on his just completed trip chung traveled via beijing after 
north korean officials refused to allow direct travel across the 
northsouth border 
for visits to the new resort he said north korea is ready to 
allow south koreans to cross the border near mount kumgang if they 
possess proper travel documents it was not known how soon such 
visits could start 
the planned projects in wonsan would make rolling stock and ships 
mainly for export to the soviet union as well as repair ships 
chung said 
wonsan is the north korean port where the us spy ship pueblo 
and its crew were taken after their capture by the north in early 
1968 
sources said chungs visit to the north followed years of private 
contacts with the north abroad

the judge hearing oliver norths irancontra 
trial is questioning the motives of a television account of initial 
trial proceedings and says he may hold the reporter responsible in 
contempt of court 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said wednesday that an 
account by abc news correspondent tim obrien appears to be a 
deliberate effort to obstruct jury selection in the trial 
obriens report aired tuesday night included testimony in 
which north admitted lying to congress at 1987 hearings north gave 
the previously nationally televised testimony under a grant of 
limited immunity but it covers the same subjects on which north now 
faces 12 felony charges 
gesell said he had not made up my mind but was considering 
whether obriens account of tuesdays proceeding provided an 
appropriate basis for a contempt action 
jury selection for the trial has been hampered by concerns about 
the finding jurors unfamiliar with norths previous testimony about 
the irancontra affair 
norths admissions to congress cannot be used against him as 
evidence and gesell has ruled that no one who heard the former 
national security council aides congressional testimony could sit 
on the jury 
the judge excused three prospective jurors wednesday because they 
had seen norths congressional testimony 
gesell said obrien took pains to tell viewers that if they 
had watched the excerpts of the testimony included in the report 
they would not have to serve on the jury 
roone arledge president of abc news said in a statement 
distributed in new york correspondent tim obrien reported fairly 
and accurately what has been said in public regarding the north 
case the publics right to be informed need not conflict with the 
fair administration of justice last nights world news tonight 
segment informed our viewers about events already having taken place 
in public arenas they cannot now be erased

the launch of the space shuttle 
discovery has been delayed and may be scrubbed because of cracks 
found in a highspeed turbopump of the spacecrafts counterpart 
atlantis 
nasa engineers said wednesday that the delay of the discovery 
flight until at least midmarch could force a postponement in a 
scheduled april launch of atlantis but the atlantis flight has 
priority and could force the cancellation of the discovery launch 
space agency officials said 
the national aeronautics and space administration made the 
announcement after shuttle managers reviewed an engineering analysis 
of cracks discovered in one of atlantis highspeed turbopumps after 
a december flight failure of the pumps could cause an explosion 
that could kill the crew 
officials said discovery will be moved to the launch pad early 
friday and three suspect pumps are to be replaced in conjunction 
with other launch preparations 
because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and 
the length of time to make the replacements nasa said it would not 
set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late 
february 
the agency had been aiming for a feb 23 liftoff for discovery 
but a series of technical delays not related to the pumps already 
had delayed that date several days 
if the date slips past march 18 the planned april 28 launch of 
atlantis will have to be delayed officials said 
officials have said the atlantis mission in april has priority 
because atlantis will be carrying the venusmagellan probe and will 
have only a 25day window to launch it 
discovery is to carry a communications satellite nasa officials 
had said previously that its flight would be put off until later in 
the year if it couldnt get off the ground by about march 15 
nasa said it could delay the atlantis flight a few days although 
it would prefer not to do so officials would like to preserve the 
entire launch window in case of problems 
only one shuttle launch pad is currently available a second is 
being refurbished 
questions were raised about the three turbopumps when engineers 
found two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of atlantis pumps 
after it completed the second postchallenger mission in december 
they believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting 
from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during the 
manufacturing process but they are not certain how the moisture 
penetrated the metal 
a search of records disclosed that two of discoverys pump 
bearings had gone through the same manufacturing process as the 
cracked one so shuttle managers decided at wednesdays meeting to 
remove all three pumps and replace them with new carefully 
inspected units 
the turbopumps which convert liquid oxygen into gas in the 
shuttles three main engines operate in flight at extremely high 
speeds pressures and temperatures and a failure of one of them 
could set off a fatal engine explosion the cracks on atlantis were 
too small to cause trouble but if such cracks widened and split the 
bearing unit it could be dangerous nasa said

a federal appeals judge overturned a lower 
court decision and barred the release of a businessman who 
authorities said tried to export nerve gas and possessed classified 
documents 
us circuit judge morton i greenberg on wednesday ordered 
juhwan yun held until a threejudge panel of the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals reviewed the the 2 million bail set by a federal 
judge in newark the review may take place as early as next week a 
prosecutor said 
yun 48 of short hills is jailed in new york for allegedly 
conspiring to export nerve gas possibly to iran 
on tuesday judge h lee sarokin ordered yuns release by 
wednesday afternoon ruling that a condition of virtual house arrest 
would be adequate to prevent him from fleeing sarokin stayed his 
ruling long enough for greenberg to consider the matter 
its perfectly apparent to me it would be irresponsible not to 
grant a stay of yuns release greenberg said 
greenberg agreed with prosecutors who argued that yuns release 
would be risky in light of the charges against him and the discovery 
in his office of documents on us intelligence gathering 
capabilities 
moreover assistant us attorney edna axelrod said yuns 
international travels indicate he could easily flee she said yuns 
wife and three children have spent most of 1988 in korea and that 
yun planned to travel to beijing iran europe and his native south 
korea 
the prosecutor also cited evidence of links between yun and 
highlevel military and civilian officials in foreign countries 
because of the sensitive nature of the case she said several 
governments would prefer that yun not go on trial 
he has contacts all over the world where he could find 
assistance ms axelrod said 
defense attorney jeremy littman contended the difficulty of 
communicating with his client in jail would hamper his ability to 
prepare for trial tentatively set for may 1 
he said the strict release conditions set by sarokin including 
travel limited to his home office and church were adequate he 
also objected to the prosecutors use of the newly discovered 
documents as more justification for keeping yun in jail when that 
discovery has led to no charges 
though charges against yun deal only with illegal weapons export 
new evidence has begun surfacing suggesting yuns involvement in 
exporting sensitive information as well 
in a letter tuesday to sarokin assistant us attorney anne 
singer said yun had classified documents revealing the united 
states capability to intercept enemy communications 
the government believes the documents could divulge information 
on us electronic warfare capabilities and knowledge of enemy 
threat a joint electronic warfare center official said in a 
memorandum to the us customs service 
a british national charles caplan also is charged in the case 
the two are accused of plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other 
military equipment for export authorities have said the nerve gas 
was possibly headed to iran

leftist guerrillas say the 
favorable us response to their proposal to take part in elections 
has moved them to suspend attacks on us institutions and personnel 
wednesdays announcement reverses a rebel stand that held us 
personnel or property as legitimate targets because washington has 
given president jose napoleon duartes government about a million 
dollars a day economic and military aid 
the insurgents last week offered to take part in presidential 
elections if the vote were postponed from march 19 to september and 
their security concerns were met it was a major turnabout for the 
rebels who had condemned all previous elections this decade as 
shams 
the government has reacted negatively to the proposal which it 
terms unconstitutional even so duarte has said he is reserving 
final judgment 
the state department said the proposal was worthy of serious 
and substantive consideration and several us lawmakers have said 
it could be an important development in the search for an end to the 
9yearold civil war 
on oct 27 guerrillas fired a rocketpropelled grenade at the 
us agency for international development building in san salvador 
the house of a highranking us diplomat was also the object of a 
grenade attack on nov 25 
no one was injured in either attack 
the insurgents issued a communique in mexico city on wednesday 
announcing an immediate suspension of attacks on us targets a 
guerrilla spokesman called san salvador radio stations which 
broadcast the communique locally 
the statement says the suspension was motivated by the positive 
reception that our proposal has had in diverse sectors of north 
american society it also cited hope of a change in us 
policy with the bush administration 
the communique says us military advisers based at salvadoran 
military installations are not covered by the suspension 
in another development the mayor of el salvadors fifth largest 
city announced that he was resigning because of guerrilla threats 
manuel eliseo perdomo of usulatan joined about 80 other mayors 
who have resigned since middecember when the guerrillas began a 
campaign of threats against them the country has 262 mayoral posts 
rebels killed nine mayors between march and november before 
adopting a policy of warnings they consider the mayors instruments 
of the counterinsurgency plan of duartes christian democratic 
government the army and the united states 
however in the election proposal the rebels offered to respect 
the mayors if they sever their links with the armys plans 
the guerrillas radio venceremos on wednesday said rebels killed 
or wounded 851 soldiers in january it did not break down the figure 
the armed forces press office said troops killed 120 guerrillas 
and wounded 115 during the month 
neither side gave its own casualties figures from both sides 
often appear to be inflated

the luck ran out this week at ki sawyer air 
force base whose personnel had miraculously survived two aviation 
accidents in the past four months 
its a fairly sad place right now marquette university 
psychologist travis martin said wednesday as the people at sawyer 
grieved for 17 colleagues and relatives killed when a kc135a air 
tanker crashed in texas the two other people aboard also were 
killed 
flags around the base 10 miles from the lake superior shoreline 
in michigans upper peninsula stood at halfstaff shivering in a 
bitter wind 
thats eerie to see that flag said one airman its even 
worse to see the families of victims coming in 
a military refueling plane from sawyer crashed and exploded in a 
mesquite field tuesday as it tried to take off from dyess air force 
base near abilene texas on a training flight to hawaii 
military officials said wednesday that an investigation into the 
crash could take weeks perhaps months in part because the kc135a 
stratotanker wasnt equipped with a flight data recorder or a 
cockpit voice recorder 
in addition to the sevenmember crew the aircraft carried at 
least three activeduty personnel and seven military retirees and 
their relatives the identities of two victims were not released 
for 10 military retirees and dependents of activeduty 
personnel are allowed to fly aboard training flights to destinations 
outside the 48 continental states on a spaceavailable basis 
the air force said military personnel can fly free 
when the plane left michigan it carried a crew of seven plus 10 
passengers 
at abilene two more passengers boarded including james a 
phillips 58 of abilene a retired technical sergeant who was 
taking advantage of the militarys spaceavailable flight option 
for the first time since he retired in 1973 his wife said wednesday 
norma phillips said her husband a 23year veteran of the air 
force was going to guam to visit his son who is in the navy and 
who married recently 
he had time on his hands and decided he would take advantage of 
this flight she said 
at sawyer 350 miles northwest of detroit members of the 
closeknit base community reacted with silence and sadness 
wednesday routine operations were carried on but participation in 
a national prayer breakfast today was canceled 
our family is going through the process of mourning were 
caring for our people the base wing commander col eldon joersz 
said in a terse meeting with reporters he walked out without 
answering questions 
memorial services at the base chapel are planned for friday 
joersz said the base community would remain closed to the news media 
until after the service about 1900 families live at sawyer 
the somber mood at the base contrasted with an atmosphere of 
relief at sawyer following the dec 6 explosion of a b52 bomber 
going through touchandgo landings on the bases main runway all 
eight crew members survived in what base personnel called a miracle 
just three months earlier 10 sawyer personnel had leaped out of 
an exploding kc135 in a crash that killed six people at a sister 
michigan base 
when you narrowly escape disaster you feel like there was 
divine intervention but underneath the dandruff is the notion is 
it going to be there the next time said dr robert moore a 
marquette psychologist 
with this third crash sawyer personnel must cope with the 
feelings they had ignored he said 
now the ultimate has happened this will stimulate all sorts of 
reaction moore said

a statement purportedly from the 
leftist group that raided an argentine army base last month claimed 
troops killed guerrillas who had surrendered and promised to fight 
on until victory 
what the soldiers did was take advantage of their superiority 
of arms to tread on our companions with tanks after they had fallen 
to incinerate them with phosphorus after they had fallen to shoot 
them after arresting them said a halfpage statement signed by 
the popular resistance front and published wednesday in the 
uruguayan newspaper la republica 
from now on they soldiers are going to pay it stated 
we swear to continue the fight until victory 
the newspaper said it was convinced the communique was authentic 
it did not say how or where the statement was obtained 
a long declaration signed by the front was found among the 
guerrillas who were killed or captured at the 3rd infantry regiment 
at la tablada on the outskirts of buenos aires during a 27hour 
battle jan 2324 
twentyeight guerrillas and 10 soldiers and police were killed 
and 63 troops were injured fourteen commandos were captured 
spokesmen for argentinas ministries of defense and interior 
declined to comment on the statement and said there probably would 
not be an official response 
the communique repeated parts of the declaration that said the 
group acted to prevent an imminent rightwing coup and crackdown on 
leftist activists no evidence was offered to back the claims 
it said 46 front members with grenade launchers and 
groundtoground missiles staged the raid the statement said more 
attacks are planned 
the front recently formed and little known is thought to be 
small but argentine officials do not discount the possibility of 
another armed attack by it or a related group 
the motivation of our companions is the increasing misery 
of the people the statement said in a country with 50 million 
head of livestock every day children die of hunger retired 
people dont earn enough to eat 
a future of peace for our country will only be possible if 
measures are taken that assure a life of dignity for the people 
justice realized and criminals punished 
the argentine government said the front is composed of leftist 
subversives from the everyone for the country movement and former 
members of the disbanded peoples revolutionary army which openly 
fought in the 1970s against argentinas thenmilitary government 
however members of the everyone for the country movement 
denounced the incident and deny involvement saying members such as 
lawyer jorge banos who participated did so on their own 
the communique did not mention the man argentine officials say 
organized and possibly led the assault former peoples 
revolutionary army leader enrique gorriaran merlo for whom an 
arrest warrant was issued last week 
president raul alfonsin of argentina formed a national security 
council to assess the risk of leftist subversion and canceled a 
planned trip to attend todays inauguration of president carlos 
andres perez of venezuela 
attorney general andre dalessio said last week that further 
assaults cannot be discounted security precautions for the 14 
guerrillas under arrest are tight

gunshots rocks and bottles rained down on 
more than 100 police officers as they put down a riot triggered by 
the arrest of a black drug suspect who later died in custody 
authorities said 
wednesday nights threehour disturbance was the third riot in 
the predominantly black college hill section in two years and the 
second in florida in two weeks 
a 22squareblock area of the neighborhood was cordoned off after 
the violence began as undercover officers struggled to arrest the 
6foot3 300pound suspected cocaine buyer 
the man fought us and punched one of our detectives three times 
in the nose said lt jesse james 
at least four officers received minor injuries including the 
detective involved in the arrest who suffered a broken nose police 
said 
no other injuries were reported police did not say if any 
arrests were made and no damage estimates were available 
a crowd estimated at 150 at its peak began to toss rocks and 
bottles at the officers before the violence was quelled a grocery 
store was looted and set ablaze and a television news van was 
damaged by two shotgun blasts police said 
the drug suspect whose name was not released collapsed in a 
police cruiser and died at st josephs hospital 
neither hospital nor police officials would discuss the nature of 
his injuries but police spokesman steve cole said no shots were 
fired the suspect was carrying a derringer a small pistol in his 
back pocket said cole 
gene bexley owner of bexleys barbq in the neighborhood said 
youths looted a grocery store before it was set on fire 
once they broke it it took 10 to 15 minutes and they cleared 
it out he said some went in then things come flying out 
windows and doors 
the fire also forced choir members at nearby deliverance 
tabernacle church to toss an organ and other valuables into a truck 
as a precaution 
a youth with a shotgun fired on a wflatv van said cameraman 
rugene moore 
i knew he was empty after the second shot said moore who 
was not injured i almost went back to get him thats what made 
me mad i guess the little guy was having a ball 
mayor sandy freedman showed up at the northeast tampa 
neighborhood wearing a formal gown 
people who are out there and causing this are hoodlums said 
the mayor who had been attending an awards dinner 
the unrest apparently spilled over to a west tampa housing 
project where youths attacked firefighters called to extinguish 
fires in two trash bins 
in october 1987 rock and bottlethrowing broke out in college 
hill after a black teenage girl was hit by a vehicle that ran off 
the road and the driver fled eight people were hurt and 11 arrested 
violence also flared in february 1987 after a 23yearold black 
man died while in police custody a white police officer who had 
used a neck hold to subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing 
and the neck hold was banned 
last month blacks in miami rioted for several days after a 
police officer fatally shot a black motorcyclist who was being 
sought for speeding

three teamsters executives settled civil 
racketeering charges by agreeing to endorse reforms sought by the 
government to curb alleged mob influence on the nations largest 
union officials said 
the three also resigned as international vice presidents and 
members of the unions executive board but said the resignations 
were not in exchange for dismissal of the case 
the settlement however does not affect the 14 remaining 
defendants in the lawsuit to oust reputed mafiadominated members of 
the teamsters executive board said assistant us attorney randy 
mastro 
the case goes to trial at the end of february mastro said 
in exchange for the union reform endorsement mastro agreed to 
drop robert holmes of detroit john cleveland of washington dc 
and maurice schurr of philadelphia as defendants in the lawsuit 
filed last june under the civil provisions of the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations rico act 
the suit claimed mobsters dominated the unions executive board 
and thus deprived the rank and file of their rights through a 
campaign of fear bribes extortion and theft 
mastro declined comment on whether the three would testify at the 
trial although he noted the agreements for holmes and cleveland 
stated there were no plans to call them as witnesses 
in addition the agreement called for the government to drop all 
claims against the pension and benefits they might receive from the 
union 
mastro also declined to confirm or deny whether settlement talks 
were under way with the union 
telephone calls for comment to the office of duke zoeller a 
teamsters spokesman in washington were not returned wednesday night 
published reports indicated that teamsters leaders had rejected a 
government proposal to settle the lawsuit brought by thenus 
attorney rudolph giuliani in exchange for the resignation of 16

as part of the agreement signed by us district judge david 
edelstein who will preside over the nonjury trial the three former 
board members will permanently resign all of their union posts and 
endorse the objective of preventing la cosa nostra corruption of 
any elements of the union 
the settlement endorsed also called on edelstein to appoint an 
individual or committee not affiliated with the union to oversee 
teamsters elections and guard against corruption 
none of the three officials admitted any wrongdoing in signing 
the agreement they did endorse changes in the unions constitution 
for the direct election of top executives by the 16 million members 
and other reforms 
holmes attorney david dumouchel said the governments action 
was a complete vindication for holmes who announced his 
resignation sunday after more than 50 years with the union 
bobby was not asked to resign and never offered to resign as 
part of any settlement discussion in this case dumouchel said 
schurr announced in october he was resigning effective the 
following month that announcement came as thennew teamsters

icelands johann hjartarson resigned to the soviet 
unions anatoly karpov after the 32nd move of the third game of the 
world chess championship quarterfinals giving karpov a nearly 
unbeatable lead in the sixgame match 
with the victory karpov leads with 25 points to 05 for 
hjartarson 
a loss by hjartarson in the next game would bring the match to an 
end said chessmaster john donaldson of seattle he said that for 
hjartarson to keep the match alive he would have to score 15 
points in the next two games a win is worth one point and a draw 
gives both players a half point 
as in the first game hjartarson who played white used a ruy 
lopez opening but then chose a more energetic game plan than in that 
game karpov defended with the flohrzaitsev variation 
the turning point in the match appeared to be the 24th move when 
hjartarson was unable to fend off karpovs advances 
the game was played despite a snowstorm in seattle that stopped 
traffic and closed many schools including lakeside school where the 
tournament is being held 
the soviet and icelandic delegations successfully argued against 
postponement of the game

its official itll be the sam and diane show 
abc news scored a major coup wednesday by signing cbs 60 
minutes correspondent diane sawyer to be coanchor with sam 
donaldson on a new primetime abc news program scheduled to go on 
the air later this year 
i think its a great thing for us and i think its going to be 
a wonderful thing for her said abc news president roone arledge 
abc also recently hired chris wallace away from nbc to be chief 
correspondent on the asyetuntitled program that sounds something 
like a primetime version of nightline but with more time 
outside the studio 
donaldson said he was delighted by the signing of sawyer 
from the very first time that i discussed this program with 
roone arledge months ago we all understood if diane would come to 
work at abc it would be a tremendous asset said donaldson i 
always wanted diane 
sawyer said she was grateful for every moment at cbs but abc 
is also a formidable news organization and this is a great creative 
adventure 
arledge said he had approached sawyer a few years ago when her 
contract was up at cbs where she has been since 1978 but did not 
have an appropriate job to offer her she turned down an offer from 
nbc and stayed with cbs where she is reported to make 12 million 
a year 
arledge said it wasnt a raise that convinced her to come over to 
abc if you know her lifestyle and interests shes obviously well 
paid and money is not a primary issue he said 
cbs continued discussions with sawyer until wednesday morning 
the deal with abc was announced in the afternoon sawyers contract 
at cbs was not yet up but it included a window that allowed her 
to leave if cbs could not offer her an anchor position 
diane sawyer was an important contributor to cbs news for more 
than a decade we thank diane for her fine work and tireless efforts 
with us and wish her the very best in the future cbs news 
president david burke said in a statement released by the network 
sawyer joined cbs in 1978 in 1981 she became cohost with 
charles kuralt of the cbs morning news she joined 60 
minutes in 1984

a meeting called by the communist 
partys central committee to stress unity ended after three days 
with the resignation or ouster of 20 senior officials including a 
former party president 
those who resigned late wednesday from the 165member 
policymaking central committee included vidoje zarkovic 
yugoslavias party chief from 19851986 and three of the largely 
formal state presidencys nine members lasar mojsov stane dolanc 
and sinan hasani 
the ouster of zarkovic a montenegrin had been demanded since 
street demonstrations in montenegro last month that led to the 
replacement of that republics entire ruling elite 
ousted from the central committee after a secret vote were azem 
vlasi former communist party chief of kosovo and svetislav 
dolasevic the ethnically troubled provinces senior communist 
official 
critics held the two responsible for not preventing intercommunal 
strife in kosovo where the ethnic albanian majority is allegedly 
persecuting minority slavs and forcing them to leave the province 
the threeday session ended without compromise on any of the 
political or economic issues convulsing this country 
earlier wednesday stipe suvar who survived attempts by 
communists from serbia to oust him as national party leader issued 
a plea for unity 
suvar in his closing speech said unity was needed to enable the 
communist party to stop losing battle after battle 
he added that yugoslavias political stability is jeopardized 
the country of 23 million people is a loose federation of six 
republics and two autonomous provinces that is plagued by ethnic 
rivalries and economic mismanagement 
suvars appeal came as officials announced the rate of inflation 
for january in this nonaligned balkan nation was 14 percent bad 
news for a country ravaged by a record 250 percent inflation rate in 
1988 
over the three days more than 85 speakers delivered impassioned 
speeches but offered no solutions to yugoslavias deep economic and 
political crisis 
in a related development the party announced it would hold its 
15th congress by dec 31 a year ahead of schedule

gov bob martinez has ordered 
prosecutors in miami to investigate new claims that a farmworker was 
framed in the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children 
justice ought to prevail whatever it may be martinez said 
wednesday as he ordered dade county attorney janet reno to continue 
a 3monthold probe begun by the governors legal office 
martinez also called for a clemency hearing for the farmworker 
james richardson 53 who is serving a life sentence at the tomoka 
correctional institution near daytona beach such a hearing requires 
approval from three of six independently elected cabinet members 
there were seven deaths we cant forget that martinez said 
at a news conference seven little ones died and someone was found 
guilty if there was a wrongdoing at that time we would like to 
know about it 
martinez said he was handing the investigation of the case over 
to ms reno because the probe by his office revealed conflicting 
information about the killings and because she has subpoena power 
the governors office and the florida department of law 
enforcement have been investigating the matter since october in 
december richardsons lawyers petitioned the florida supreme court 
for another trial based on new evidence 
a feb 9 hearing has been scheduled on that request by lawyers 
ellis rubin and mark lane they claim prosecutors framed richardson 
and that a neighbor who frequently babysat the children was the 
killer 
rubin said wednesdays action would not change the course of his 
petition 
i do praise the governor for having enough integrity to look at 
this case and say something is wrong he said 
richardson and his wife were picking fruit on oct 25 1967 when 
their children aged 2 to 8 ate a parathionlaced lunch of beans 
rice and grits the lunch had been prepared ahead of time but was 
served by neighbor betsy reese at the familys arcadia home 
prosecutors said richardson killed all seven children but he was 
convicted of only one firstdegree murder count in may 1968 for the 
death of his 8yearold stepdaughter betty jean bryant

greenpeace today ended eight days of 
harassing a japanese whaling fleet off antarctica leaving 
whaleshaped gingerbread cookies to the crews with a note if you 
want to eat whales eat these 
the environmental group said its ship the gondwana was steaming 
toward a us base on antarcticas mcmurdo sound which it claims is 
heavily polluted 
we have finally finished our project here said spokesman 
paul bogart interviewed by radio telephone aboard the gondwana 
we spent 90 minutes flying over the factory ship and three catcher 
boats lowering the packages as a parting gift 
bogart said the note attached to the cookies dropped by 
helicopter read we bear no animosity to the japanese people or 
members of the japanese ships 
he said greenpeace informed the japanese skipper of kyo maru no 
1 the factory ship that the environmental organization filmed and 
photographed the harpooning and electrocution of minke whales during 
the past week 
japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its 
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks despite 
a moratorium imposed by the international whaling commission 
greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi 
restaurants in japan 
bogart said the greenpeace helicopter dropped a box of cookies 
for each crew member with an attached note saying if you want to 
eat whales eat these 
he said one of the japanese catcher boats then relayed a message 
thanking the group for the package 
japanese whaling officials in tokyo have accused greenpeace of 
engaging in terrorist tactics and endangering lives 
greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew 
international attention to the plight of whales 
the group estimated the japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales 
in wellington new zealand greenpeace supporters in 
bloodspattered overalls today delivered bags of imitation whale 
meat to the japanese embassy and cultural center to protest the 
whale kill

a japanese soap opera is so much the rage 
in fundamentalist iran that sacrilegious praise of its heroine 
during a live radio callin program led to the brief imprisonment of 
four tehran radio executives 
an unidentified female caller had contended the series 
persevering protagonist is a better role model for iranian women 
than the daughter of mohammed the founder of islam 
those remarks in this predominantly shiite moslem land of 50 
million people triggered an outcry similar to john lennons remark 
during a 1960s news conference that the beatles were more popular 
than jesus christ 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini angrily demanded the radio executives 
be punished for offending islam and his wish was heeded 
theology aside the television show oshin which depicts a 
girls travails in devastated postwar japan is wildly popular among 
iranians as they recover from their eightyear war with iraq 
traffic stops and blackouts are postponed during broadcasts of 
the serial whose heroine oshin suffers every imaginable hardship 
and setback 
the four executives were sentenced to prison terms by a tehran 
court tuesday for broadcasting the phonein program 
broadcast director mohammad arab mazaryazdi got five years and 
each of the three others mahmoud abulqasemi director of islamic 
ideology hamid khunmeri head of supervision and mohammad rasekh 
editor of ideological programs received a fouryear sentence and 
50 lashes 
but the official islamic republic news agency today quoted the 
daily newspaper jomhuri islami as saying khomeini agreed to pardon 
the broadcasters on wednesday after receiving an appeal on their 
behalf from chief justice abdolkarim musavi ardebili 
the news agency monitored in nicosia said khomeini had stressed 
in a letter to the staterun radios director that if proven there 
was a deliberate insult the caller should receive the death 
sentence 
the revolutionary patriarchs fierce reaction to the call 
underlined the religious passions that flow through iran but those 
passions have not kept the soap opera from captivating iranian 
television viewers 
the drama whose broadcasts began last year in iran was chosen 
by officials who thought oshin an exemplary role model for iranians 
suffering hardships that included iraqi rocket attacks on tehran and 
the loss of by some estimates a million of their countrymen 
it became an instant hit 
week after week oshin struggles on despite food shortages and 
cruel relatives loses her house in a fire and faces trial after 
trial 
after oshins father died in one episode an iranian newspaper 
published a fullpage obituary letters of condolence and telegrams 
poured in from all over the country 
when the heroine couldnt find enough rice to feed herself 
sympathizers sent the tv station some of their own precious rice 
rationing coupons for her 
an iranian schoolboy who recently traveled to cyprus brought with 
him a prized possession a pocketsized poster of oshin which he 
said he bought outside his school for about 250 
oshin has become a popular brand name for everything from shoes 
to electrical appliances according to travelers from tehran its 
also a favorite name for newborn baby girls 
daily power outages which last up to six hours in the larger 
cities are never scheduled for saturday nights when oshin is 
broadcast 
just before the hourlong episodes tv announcers ask viewers to 
switch off all unnecessary electric lights and appliances so the 
power supply will not be overloaded while the show is running 
one tehran woman who experienced an unexpected blackout on 
saturday recently while oshin was showing called a taxi to take her 
to another part of the city where the power was still on so she 
could see the show 
the driver raced her to a cafe where both sat down to see the 
program over a cup of tea 
tehrans hectic traffic grinds to a halt while oshin is on tv 
if you want to hail a taxi while oshin is on youre out of 
luck one traveler from tehran said 
thus on saturday birthday of the prophets daughter fatima 
zahra when the woman who telephoned in to the daily family 
radio program was asked whether fatima zahra was a fitting model for 
iranian women her answer was an emphatic no 
fatima zahra is not acceptable because she lived 1400 years 
ago she said i prefer oshin

a gunowners group that led an unsuccessful 
attempt to repeal marylands handgun control law last year is 
threatening to boycott businesses that supported the statute 
a letter was mailed recently to more than 200 businesses on the 
stationery of the maryland state rifle and pistol association it 
was signed by fred griisser a leader of the 1988 campaign against a 
law that bans cheap handguns 
were going to give the people a chance to explain themselves 
before we declare a boycott said robert mcmurray membership 
chairman of the gun group we are going to declare a boycott 
against those who dont respond 
the association already has withdrawn its funds from signet bank 
in retaliation for a contribution the bank made to gun control 
backers he said 
jack schwartz an assistant state attorney general said he 
learned of the letter wednesday from a printing company that 
received a copy 
its deeply offensive and its just not the way our system 
operates schwartz said whats so troubling is the election is 
over the voters made their decision and now there appears to be an 
effort of economic retaliation to those who participated 
mcmurray said 225 to 250 businesses that made contributions to 
the citizens against saturday night specials were sent letters 
the letters say an explanation of why businesses supported the 
law would be helpful for consumers to make a more informed 
decision when selecting products and services 
they also note that the maryland state rifle and pistol 
association represents the interests of the more than 650000 
maryland voters who thought this the handgun control law a bad and 
dangerous law 
last novembers ballot measure to repeal the law lost by a 58 
percent to 42 percent

israels christian ally in lebanon 
expelled four lebanese today from the israeli buffer zone and killed 
three palestinian guerrillas in an ambush police said 
a police spokesman identified one deportee as yahya ali an 
educator attached to the lebanese ministry of education the names 
of the other three men all shibaa natives like ali were not 
immediately available 
the foreign ministry in beirut said in a statement it told 
lebanons un ambassador rashid fakhoury to lodge a formal 
complaint with the un security council to halt a wave of 
deportations involving 80 people in the past month 
most were expelled after allegations that they refused to 
cooperate with israelisponsored local administrations in their 
villages or defied orders to join israels christian ally the south 
lebanon army 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said militiamen of the south lebanon army drove ali and 
his three companions from shibaa to the edge of israels 
selfdesignated security zone 
in tyre militiamen of the south lebanon army ambushed during the 
night a guerrilla unit near the village of srobbine five miles 
north of the israeli border and killed its three members a 
security source said 
no casualties were reported among the christian force said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it was not immediately clear if the guerrillas were headed for 
israel or planned an attack within the security zone 
israel created the zone which runs up to 10 miles into lebanon 
when it withdrew most of its occupation army from south lebanon in 
the summer of 1985 ending a threeyear invasion 
the strip is designed to serve as a buffer against guerrilla 
attacks into northern israel but the infiltrations have continued

the foreign ministers of china and the soviet 
union agreed today that progress is being made in resolving the 
cambodia conflict which has hampered sinosoviet efforts to end a 
generation of strained relations 
the soviet eduard shevardnadze also concurred with the chinese 
position that international supervision will be needed to ensure 
peace in cambodia after vietnam ends its 10year occupation of the 
southeast asian country 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said shevardnadzes nearly 
threehour meeting with foreign minister qian qichen focused on 
cambodia and did not touch on the main purpose of shevardnadzes 
visit setting a date for the first sinosoviet summit since 1959 
the meeting between soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
chinese senior leader deng xiaoping expected this spring is likely 
to be discussed when the foreign ministers meet again friday 
shevardnadze is the first soviet foreign minister to visit china 
since andrei gromyko came in 1959 with nikita krushchev todays 
official china youth news said shevardnadze was a welcome change 
from the unyielding position of the stonefaced gromyko 
shevardnadzes grasp of foreign affairs is by no means second 
to his predecessor the report said he has a great amount of 
authority and quickly understands the essence of a problem 
li quoted shevardnadze as saying the process of settling the 
cambodian question is speeding up qian agreed saying the 
situation concerning the kampuchean cambodian question has been 
developing 
qian said the three chinesebacked resistance factions and the 
vietnambacked government should be allowed to solve the question of 
cambodias future free from outside interference 
asked by reporters if cambodia has ceased to be an obstacle to 
better sinosoviet relations li said both china and the soviet 
union maintain that vietnam should pull out all its troops from 
kampuchea as early as possible the two sides hold that the 
kampuchean question should be given a fair and reasonable solution 
and for this purpose the two countries have been making much 
effort 
differences reportedly remain on the structure of a transitional 
government and the nature of the international supervision to be 
introduced after vietnams pullout vietnam has promised to withdraw 
its troops by september 
china has said moscows financial support for vietnam is the most 
serious of three obstacles to normalizing political relations 
strained for the past three decades 
the other two were the soviet occupation of afghanistan which 
moscow says will end this month and soviet troop strength on the 
sinosoviet border gorbachev last month pledged to reduce soviet 
troops in asia many of whom are along the chinese border by 
200000 
progress on those obstacles paved the way for qian in december to 
make the first trip by a chinese foreign minister to moscow in 32 
years 
li said the question of relaxing the situation along the 
sinosoviet border was also discussed at the meeting in the great 
hall of the people 
the two sides fought a short border war in 1969 sinosoviet 
relations soured in the late 1950s as nikita s khrushchev and mao 
tsetung split over ideological and strategic differences and 
khrushchev ended all soviet technical and military aid to china in 
1960 
economic and cultural relations have slowly improved in the 
1980s but party and government ties will not be formally normalized 
until the summit takes place 
also today shevardnadze toured the great wall about 40 miles 
northwest of beijing he will meet premier li peng on friday and fly 
to shanghai for a saturday meeting with deng xiaoping

ferdinand marcos has been placed back on a 
respirator and has taken a definite turn for the worse and his 
wife is recovering after fainting while accompanying him to the 
operating room officials said 
the 71yearold ousted philippine president who underwent 
emergency surgery wednesday at st francis medical center was in 
critical but stable condition today said a hospital operator who 
refused to give her name 
philippine vice president salvador laurel said he was leaving for 
hawaii today for a meeting requested by marcos wife imelda 
because doctors had advised marcos that he hasnt much time left 
to live 
hes basically very very weak and depending completely on the 
respirator to regulate his breathing hospital spokeswoman norma 
kop said wednesday he had been doing better so this is a 
definite turn for the worse 
joe lazo a friend who visited the couple wednesday said marcos 
looks the worst ive ever seen him 
marcos underwent an emergency tracheotomy early wednesday because 
of fluids building up in his lungs nursing supervisor cindy miller 
said 
during the 40minute operation a tube was inserted into marcos 
throat to make it easier for him to breathe and to clear his lungs 
he was hooked to a respirator and had a slight fever she said 
mrs marcos 59 fainted while accompanying her husband as he was 
being wheeled to surgery and fell and hit her head miller said 
she was exhausted shes gone several days without sleep and 
then knowing what they were doing to the president she just passed 
out said marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad adding that he expected 
mrs marcos to be hospitalized for one or two days 
no one caught mrs marcos as she fell face forward onto the floor 
because everyone was walking behind her as marcos was being wheeled 
to surgery trinidad said 
i was so shocked trinidad said all of this is just 
starting to get to her i hope its nothing serious the doctors 
said she needs a lot of rest 
mrs marcos head injury was not serious but she was admitted 
into the room that had been used by her husband miller said she 
was in satisfactory condition today 
an aide who answered the phone in her hospital room said mrs 
marcos was resting comfortably but unable to take calls 
marcos was admitted to the hospital on jan 15 for treatment of 
pneumonia and bronchial asthma in december he was hospitalized 
twice for treatment of congestive heart failure 
a federal judge in new york is to decide this month whether 
marcos is healthy enough to stand trial on criminal racketeering 
charges accusing him of plundering his homeland and stashing much of 
the money in the united states 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on 5 
million bail 
the marcoses have lived in hawaii since fleeing the philippines 
during a civilianmilitary uprising that brought corazon aquino to 
power in february 1986 
in manila today mrs aquino said she believed that marcos 
condition is neither critical nor serious 
laurels announcement that he was traveling to hawaii followed 
rumors in manila and in honolulu that he and filipino industrialist 
enrique zobel were trying to work out a deal to allow marcos to 
return to his native land 
laurel said he had informed mrs aquino and executive secretary 
catalino macaraig of his trip and would immediately relay message to 
the president 
presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said laurel was acting on 
his own and not as an emissary of mrs aquino

authorities have apologized to a man who was 
arrested more than a dozen times on warrants meant for someone else 
but they denied charges that the arrests were racially motivated 
there have been people of all races arrested on warrants that 
were issued for another person with the same name said assistant 
police chief ray sanders 
we would hope that the person insist he is not the right one 
and that the officers would listen to him it would appear that the 
ball was dropped in this case sanders said 
at a news conference tuesday sylvester brown said he was 
arrested 14 times over the past 10 years on warrants issued for a 
sylvester e brown both are 39 sylvester e brown remains at 
large sanders said 
after learning of the mistaken arrests sheriff doyne bailey 
issued a memorandum in october alerting deputies and booking 
officers of the existence of two sylvester browns with the similar 
descriptions and dates of birth brown was given a copy of the 
memo to carry 
but the wrongly arrested brown said only one arresting officer 
gave him the opportunity to explain that he wasnt the man named in 
the warrants 
there are real racial overtones i dont think that a white 
person would have been treated the same way said gary bledsoe 
president of the local national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
lt roger napier of the police internal affairs division said 
his office was investigating the warrants to see when they were 
issued and why they were never cleared 
the police department also plans to issue a memo to all officers 
informing them of the mistaken arrests napier said 
i can understand mr browns position napier said if it 
happens once thats going to upset you but if it happens 
repeatedly youre going to lose your patience nobody likes to 
admit that theyre wrong that theyve made a mistake but thats 
what happened

a us air force plane carrying tons of 
equipment and a team of cleanup experts headed to antarctica today 
to fight an oil spill that some scientists say could pose a major 
environmental threat 
the huge c5 plane was bound for the southern city of punta 
arenas where its cargo and the 15member team will be transferred 
to a us research vessel the polar duke the us embassy in 
santiago said 
in the antarctic us scientists were trying to catch floating 
oil barrels and propane containers near the spill which was four 
miles in diameter and moving to the southwest the national science 
foundation said 
the agency said in washington the argentine supply vessel that 
released the oil after it ran aground and sank was carrying 250000 
gallons of diesel fuel it said an incurable disaster would 
result if all the fuel leaks into the regions unspoiled waters 
in buenos aires an argentine navy spokesman said the spill would 
not pose a serious ecological threat 
a spokesman for the chilean navy agreed the information that 
we have is that there is no big spill said lt juan pablo barros 
in a telephone interview today 
the bahia paraiso paradise bay ran aground on saturday in the 
bismarck strait 600 miles south of the southern tip of south 
america and 1 miles from the us palmer research station on the 
antarctic peninsula the ship was carrying supplies for antarctic 
outposts and sightseers 
all 250 passengers and crew were rescued but the ship floated 
free in heavy seas and sank tuesday dropping barrels of oil and 
several hundred propane gas containers into the water said jack 
talmadge a spokesman for the national science foundation 
another foundation spokesman in washington jack renerie said 
most of the oil was in steel drums so the ecological threat may not 
be great however theres a bunch of free drifting oil down 
there he said the slick has arrived at palmer station a 
scientific outpost run by the foundation 
renerie said personnel at the station had collected some steel 
barrels of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas near the ship 
the latest we have now is that theres probably 150 to 200 
barrels still in the water renerie said in a telephone 
interview today from santiago and theres still oil coming out of 
the ship 
he said the ship is about 80 to 90 percent underwater but 
appears to have settled firmly on a shoal 
the water surrounding the ship is covered with a couple of 
centimeters about an inch of oil there is a sheen of oil in a 
much wider area around the ship including evidence of oil on the 
coastline of the several islands there talmadge said 
wildlife has already begun to be affected including krill 
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the antarctic food 
chain talmadge said 
birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior 
differences he said one dead penguin had been found as of a 
few hours ago 
the air force transport left norfolk va on wednesday and was 
to arrive in chile today talmadge said its crew and 52 tons of 
cargo would reach the accident site by monday 
the cargo includes a 35foot skimming boat for scooping up 
spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks a small tugboat 
inflatable booms to contain the spill and a special truck for 
loading and unloading the equipment said renerie he said it was 
accompanied by a crew from two private us cleanup companies 
marine pollution control and global associates 
the national science foundation is organizing the cleanup 
mission with assistance from the air force navy and the national

artillery fire echoed through the 
capital today as president najib sought to assure reporters his 
government will survive once soviet soldiers are gone and his troops 
alone face moslem guerrillas 
a moslem guerrilla leader in pakistan predicted the najib 
government will collapse as soon as the red army has left 
also today western journalists saw a convoy of more than 100 
soviet trucks and tanks starting out along the salang highway the 
only road from kabul to the soviet border 
state power is in full control of the situation despite the 
difficulties najib told a news conference in an unheated room at 
the foreign ministry 
reporters were not allowed to leave the building during the 
conference for security reasons and explosions and artillery fire 
could be heard 
najib said his sovietbacked government cannot be excluded from 
any future coalition with moslem insurgents who have refused any 
powersharing arrangement and are not party to the unmediated 
accord under which the soviets promised to withdraw all their troops 
by feb 15 
najib said all soviet forces would be out in the next few 
days he would not elaborate 
afghan troops are capable of independently defending the people 
and the homeland and can give a resolute and mental rebuff to the 
opposition najib asserted 
fears have increased in kabul because of uncertainty about the 
armys ability to defend the capital against the insurgents who at 
several points have shut off the flow of food and fuel 
in pakistan guerrilla leader gulbaddin hekmatyar told reporters 
today najibs regime will fall in weeks not months 
hekmatyar leader of the hezbiislami guerrilla group said 
major cities including kabul will fall without the guerrillas 
having to launch largescale attacks 
najib expressed optimism that soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze might be able to help in a political settlement to the 
conflict in a planned visit saturday to pakistan a key supporter of 
the guerrillas with the united states 
the president insisted his peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan will have to be part of any solution any attempt to 
exclude the pdpa and its allies in a coalition government will be in 
vain 
the soviets intervened in december 1979 to help fight an 
insurgency that began a year earlier when marxists seized power in a 
bloody coup the soviet force numbered about 115000 before the 
pullout began 
moscow has assured the najib government it will continue to 
provide military assistance after its last soldiers are gone 
an estimated 1000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers 
ammunition and small missiles move north along the salang highway 
every day afghan officers stationed along the road have said 
guerrillas bombarded a soviet convoy on wednesday two miles past 
a checkpoint north of kabul 
the soviets also use the highway to carry flour eggs kerosene 
and fuel to the capital where food and fuel shortages have been 
reported in recent weeks partly due to guerrilla attacks on convoys 
moving on the highway 
the emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that 
formed outside bread shacks most lines have disappeared or become 
noticeably shorter 
it was unclear how long the soviet tranport will continue to 
kabul where refugees from the war have more than doubled the 
population to 2 million 
in pakistan officials today said an afghan military transport 
plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed about 20 miles inside 
pakistan killing at least nine crew members 
they said the plane went down tuesday in a remote area of north 
west frontier province but would not say if the afghans were trying 
to defect 
searchers recovered nine bodies some clad in afghan military 
uniforms and the remnants of longrange rockets and other arms 
said the officials speaking on condition of anonymity they would 
not identify the type of aircraft 
there was no immediate comment from the afghan government or 
state media 
pakistanbased guerrillas said wednesday that 400 government 
troops defected during weekend assaults in kandahar afghanistans 
second largest city the report could not be independently confirmed

as the crack problem grows ever larger its 
victims have become ever younger the latest two an 11yearold 
alleged to be a drug courier and a 10yearold crack dealer left 
officials wondering if theyre losing the drug fight 
crack and drugs are so pervasive that of course it trickles 
down into the lower grades said paul berczeller a spokesman for 
the united federation of teachers you have young kids used every 
day as drug runners 
ginay marks a brooklyn school board activist for 17 years 
agreed i would say in terms of crack and we thought heroin was 
an epidemic nothing has spread with such rapidity among our school 
children 
the two gradeschoolers arrested in separate incidents less than 
three weeks apart offered examples of both street and school 
incidents authorities said 
the 10yearold was arrested jan 15 after police watched him and 
a 14yearold partner make a halfdozen crack sales in wyandanch 
long island the 5foottall boy had three 20 vials of crack and 
226 cash on him when arrested 
a family court judge ruled wednesday that he had committed the 
crimes and scheduled sentencing for feb 10 the boy faces up to 18 
months detention in a youth facility or two years probation 
charges against the 14yearold were pending 
on tuesday an 11yearold boy arrived at his bronx elementary 
school carrying what looked like his lunch bag inside school 
officials found 411 vials of crack most in 10packs worth 50 
apiece 
the special education student told police his 17yearold brother 
had given him the drugs a search was on wednesday for the brother 
said police spokesman officer hugh barry 
a family court hearing was held wednesday for the 11yearold 
but there was no ruling the city also filed a petition seeking to 
put the boy his 13yearold brother and 5yearold sister in foster 
care 
when an 11yearold child with special learning needs is 
exploited as a drug carrier it reaffirms my belief that drugs are 
the most serious problem our youth must confront said schools 
chancellor richard green 
local school board president lawrence a warden whose bronx 
district includes the school that the 11yearold attended said he 
was shocked and angry after the arrest 
we dont expect that from an 11yearold youngster its like 
carrying a loaded machine gun in a playground said warden 
board of education spokesman robert terte saying much of the 
problem is on the streets around the schools noted that the number 
of drug arrests on school property was down in the past year in 
1987 the figure was 114 for 1988 it was 94 
remember youre talking about 180 school days with nearly 
1000 schools and 940000 kids said terte in percentage terms 
thats a very small number 
but berczeller said the increasing drug problem was at least 
partially responsible for the increase in violence against teachers 
in the city for the period sept 1dec 1 1988 188 teachers were 
assaulted for the same period in 1987 the figure was 119 teachers 
a 58 percent jump he said 
to try to stem the drug tide the city runs a drug education 
program that runs from kindergarten through 12th grade said 
georgeanne delcanto acting assistant director of health physical 
education and substance abuse for the city schools 
each city school district is also assigned five to 15 drug 
counselors and a special anticrack curriculum was started two 
years ago she said ms marks who is also on gov mario cuomos 
advisory council on substance abuse said she believed certain 
programs in her district were helping students avoid drugs 
but the two arrests particularly the one of a special education 
student in his school have other officials wondering if the tide 
is turning into a tidal wave 
are we losing the battle i think were in the middle of the 
battle but the schools are not immune from the ills of society 
said berczeller if you have kids running drugs on the street 
youll find kids running drugs in the schools

youth he previously was convicted of burglary and indecent exposure 
the 5foot7 150pound youth allegedly tied up a 28yearold 
woman and raped her on friday while free on a 300 bond which 
stemmed from an attack on another woman in southeast denver last 
summer 
detectives say he is the youngest rape suspect they can recall 
weve never seen anything like this police sgt bj haze said 
because of his age the boys name was withheld

president pw botha who is 
recovering from a stroke he suffered two weeks ago resigned today 
as the leader of the governing national party but said he will stay 
on as the nations president 
botha 73 told party officials in a letter that he was resigning 
the party post to concentrate on his presidential duties and to 
distance the presidency from partisan politics state radio reported 
the national partys parliamentary caucus chose national 
education minister fw de klerk to replace botha as party leader 
at a news conference in cape town today de klerk declined to 
discuss his political agenda he appears to favor bothas policies 
of limited and gradual reform of south africas apartheid system of 
racial separation 
the party parliamentary caucus chose de klerk by a vote of 6961 
over finance minister barend du plessis who is considered slightly 
more moderate said the staterun south african broadcasting corp 
other contenders including foreign minister pik botha and the 
acting president constitutional develpoment minister chris heunis 
were eliminated in early rounds of balloting according to state 
radio 
botha became party leader in 1978 when he was elected prime 
minister he became president in 1984 under a new constitution that 
abolished the post of prime minister 
south africas president is selected by the political party that 
controls parliament which opens this years session friday in cape 
town 
botha has refused to discuss his possible retirement but has said 
during the past year he would consider reducing his work load 
a bill has been introduced to revive the post of prime minister 
to share leadership duties with the president 
botha is recovering from his stroke at his private residence in 
cape town and takes daily walks in his garden his doctors say 
the stroke weakened bothas left arm and left leg and he will 
need at least one more month of rest before he can consider 
returning to work the doctors said today 
as education minister de klerk 52 has not been associated with 
any major reforms he supported a controversial crackdown on 
antiapartheid dissent at universities and has tried to halt 
defections from the national party to the extremeright conservative 
party 
de klerk said today that if he wanted to propose any policy 
changes as head of the national party i would like first to have 
a discussion with the state president 
a very special relationship will now have to develop between 
myself as leaderinchief of the national party on the one hand and 
the state president as chief executive on the other hand he said 
at the news conference 
de klerk declined to answer directly when asked if his selection 
as party leader made him the logical successor to botha he noted 
that his position had no direct or formal constitutional 
implications 
the independent south african press association said however 
that de klerks selection as party leader is a firm indicator 
that should president botha resign he would succeed him 
the president is chosen after national elections are held 
there was widespread speculation botha would call for an election 
in april but his stroke makes such a ballot unlikely until later 
this year observers say 
the national party which codified apartheid legislation after 
coming to power in 1948 has ruled uninterrupted since then and is 
expected to maintain power in the next election 
other contenders to succeed botha as president include heunis du 
plessis pik botha and defense minister magnus malan 
all appear to favor bothas policies of gradual race reform 
although pik botha is considered slightly more liberal than the 
others

authorize the sale of 315 frontline abrams tanks to saudi arabia 
and 200 to kuwait while providing a third arab country the united 
arab emirates with 40 f18 fighter jets informed sources said 
today 
egypt meanwhile would get 150 hawk missiles and israel 200 
shoulderfired stingers while jordan again would receive no 
american weapons this year said the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the potential arab purchases could touch off another row with 
israels supporters in congress who were successful during the 
carter and reagan administrations in blocking us sales that were 
considered threating to the jewish state 
but the skilfull management of james a baker iii then the white 
house chief of staff and now secretary of state and other reagan 
administration operatives overcame stubborn resistance to the sale 
of awacs radar planes to saudi arabia which the senate approved 
5248 
the abrams tank is considered the best in the world recently 
us and egyptian officials completed arrangements for coproduction 
in egypt with the aim of providing the egyptian army with them 
the weapons list sent to congress last thursday is classified 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee that deals with the middle east is understood to have 
cautioned other members of congress and staff aides not to leak any 
of the items 
meanwhile the white house in a cover letter informed congress 
the saudis were in the process of deciding whether to request us 
or european fighter planes to replace their f5s in the next decade 
the sources said 
the letter said the saudis were considering jet fighters to be 
jointly produced by britain and west germany and the french mirage 
4000 as well as usbuilt f16s and f18s 
on the list for the saudis were seven multiplelaunch artillery 
rocket systems for battlefield use and seven of the boxtype 
rockets for kuwait along with 1500 tow antitank missiles 
egypt was listed to receive 150 hawk antiaircraft missiles and 
israel four helicopters along with the stinger missiles 
congress had barred us arms sales to jordan until the arab 
kingdom makes a serious attempt to enter peace talks with israel

punxsutawney phil that plump pampered 
groundhog long touted as americas best mammalian meteorological 
prognosticator saw his shadow today predicting six more weeks of a 
kinder and gentler winter 
phils promoters declaring today the 102nd groundhog day 
rousted the brown bewhiskered forecaster out of his lighted heated 
burrow at dawn 
in honor of americas new president george bush the groundhog 
stood tall and proud he spotted a thin short shadow 
punxsutawney groundhog club president james h means told spectators 
gathered at gobblers knob a wooded knoll about three miles south 
of punxsutawney 
the king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with a 
promise of a kinder and gentler winter means said 
tradition has it if the weatherwise woodchuck sees his shadow 
six more weeks of winter will follow but if he doesnt they say 
spring is just around the corner 
phils unscientific forecasts dont always hold up but his 
handlers nevertheless claim hes never wrong 
we say hes always right said william null secretary of the 
groundhog club and executive director of the local chamber of 
commerce there are some people who contest that usually 
weathermen but we stand behind phil 100 percent 
groundhog day fun has given rise to fourlegged forecasters 
elsewhere and most of them today broke with phil and predicted an 
early spring despite the arctic blast thats been working its way 
across the country in the past couple of days but none draws the 
attention that phil does 
phils been at it longer than any of the others null said 
hes treated like a real king 
some folks in newport ri made up quahog day and cast a 
man dressed as a quahog a type of clam to come out of his shell 
today the quahog did not see his shadow so rhode island is 
theoretically assured of a short winter 
georgias also off the hook winterwise as a groundhog dubbed 
general lee failed to see a shadow today in lilburn ga 
west virginias concord charlie and french creek freddy both 
failed to see their shadows this morning as did buckeye chuck in 
marion ohio and rowdy a groundhog at the indianapolis zooand it 
was likewise in sun prairie wis where jimmy the groundhog braved 
windchills of 16 below to predict an early spring there 
but it is this western pennsylvania mountain town of about 8000 
people that bills itself as the weather capital of the world 
crowns a groundhog queen and king stages a groundhog ball and 
attracts tourbus visitors who often buy souvenirs glorifying the 
exalted woodchuck 
every year hundreds of people follow a centuryold tradition and 
trudge up to phils onemorningayear home atop gobblers knob 
fourteen businessmen of the clubs exclusive inner circle don 
top hats and tuxedos to carry on the tradition actually inner 
circle members decide on the groundhogs prediction beforehand 
several hours before sunrise phil is taken from his yearround 
home in a glassenclosed case next to the town library and shoved 
into the manmade burrow to await spectators 
the woodchuck whose species usually hibernates until march is 
then hoisted at dawn to the glare of television floodlights and 
popping flashbulbs 
perhaps cleverly phil has predicted an early spring only nine 
times in 1890 1902 1934 1950 1970 1975 1983 1986 and 1988 
according to null 
groundhog day legend is based on an old scottish couplet 
claiming if candlemas day is bright and clear there will be two 
winters in the year feb 2 is the christian holiday of candlemas 
in the late 1800s the feast appealed to punxsutawneys 
germanborn farmers who hunted woodchucks for food 
for the record the national weather services 30day outlook 
calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation 
in the southeast below normal temperatures and precipitation over 
the northwest near normal temperatures and precipitation in the 
northeast and near normal temperatures and above normal 
temperatures over the nations central area

us district judge alcee l hastings lost a 
preliminary round in his impeachment trial today when a senate panel 
called for televised hearings before a special committee rather than 
before the full senate 
there will be no question about the fairness of it sen 
wendell ford dky said after the senate rules committee he chairs 
called for a special panel of six republican and six democratic 
senators to hear evidence 
under a twostep procedure recommended by the rules committee 
the full senate would first rule upon motions by hastings and his 
attorneys for dismissal of charges that the 52yearold florida 
jurist plotted to get a 150000 payoff ford said the senate could 
act within 30 days 
the special committee appointed by senate leaders then would hear 
perhaps six weeks of evidence in the case with television cameras 
on hand and proceedings being taped for viewing at leisure by other 
senators 
the rules committee approved the blueprint on a 90 vote 
it would not be the the first judicial impeachment trial on 
television hearings in the case of impeached us district judge 
harry e claiborne of nevada were carried two years ago 
the rules committee left in up to the special panel whether the 
current one also would be broadcast nationwide or merely to senate 
offices 
hastings who was not on hand for the committee meeting had 
asked for evidence hearings before the full senate 
short of that he had sought to have the evidence hearings taped 
saying that senators should see the demeanor of the witnesses 
the video will give us an opportunity to accommodate judge 
hastings in his request that we watch the demeanor of the 
witnesses ford told the rules committee he told reporters 
afterward however that lawmakers would watch only if they want 
to 
hastings was acquitted in 1983 of charges that he plotted with a 
washington attorney to obtain 150000 in return for assuring that 
two convicted racketeers would not serve time 
other judges however brought the evidence to the attention of 
the house which on aug 8 voted 4133 to approve a bill of 
impeachment 
hastings maintains he is innocent and says the allegations 
represent an attempt to oust him for political reasons 
the bill of impeachment says hastings plotted to get the payoff 
made false statements at his trial and in an unrelated matter 
disclosed secret wiretap information wrecking a federal 
investigation in the process 
empaneling a special committee to hear the evidence is not new 
the procedure was used for the first time in the 1986 impeachment 
trial of claiborne who sought in vain to hang onto his robes even 
though he was already in prison for tax evasion 
the idea of a special committee goes back to the 1930s when 
lawmakers themselves said they were appalled by a dreary 
protracted and involved impeachment trial on the senate floor in 
which evidence was sometimes presented to a chamber that was all but 
empty 
hastings told reporters on jan 26 however that the issue was 
far too important to be shunted into a committee 
this is not an agriculture bill he said this is my office 
that is at stake here

the senate banking committee today approved the 
nomination as housing secretary of former rep jack kemp who has 
agreed to give up more than 55000 in speaking fees after being 
told he apparently violated limits on outside income for members of 
congress 
kemps nomination by president bush to become secretary of 
housing and urban development was approved unanimously by the 
committee and sent to the senate floor for confirmation 
the committee also unanimously approved and sent to the senate 
bushs nomination of michael j boskin to be chairman of the council 
of economic advisers 
kemp filed financial disclosure forms last week with the 
committee and the federal office of government ethics reporting 
honoraria amounting to 67350 above what house rules allow 
the associated press learned wednesday that the staff director of 
the democraticcontrolled committee kevin gottlieb confronted kemp 
personally last week with the apparent violation 
the former congressman from buffalo ny agreed to return 
16000 in speaking fees and to forgo another 39400 in fees not 
yet received 
he also deferred receipt of an additional 12500 in fees earned 
in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria 
congressmen can receive in any one year the actions brought kemp 
550 below his 1988 limit 
a spokeswoman for kemp mary brunette described the problems as 
just a misunderstanding 
gottlieb said today that no objections were raised by senate 
committee members because kemp moved quickly to correct the problems 
and cooperated fully 
gottlieb said the former congressman mistakenly believed that 
money received after leaving congress was not covered by the house 
limits even though it was for appearances made while a member of 
congress 
kemp filed an amended financial report with the senate banking 
housing and urban affairs committee and the us office of 
government ethics on monday to reflect the changes the changes were 
made without public disclosure by either kemp or the senate 
committee 
kemps aide and the committee acknowledged the changes in 
response to questions from the ap which identified the problem in a 
review of kemps financial statements 
kemp was subject to the house rules limiting all outside income 
including honoraria to 30 percent of his 89500 congressional 
salary or 26850 in addition a less restrictive federal statute 
limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary or 35800 
in his original filing kemp reported receiving 119000 in 
honoraria for 1988 he also reported giving 24800 of the money to 
charity which under house rules is not counted against the limit 
house rules also limit honoraria fees for speeches or similar 
appearances to no more than 2000 per event in his original 
filing kemp reported several well in excess of that 2000 limit 
he reported receiving 30000 for two appearances on the 
television show firing line in september and october and 
10000 each for speeches to hartford university ab laffer and 
associates and the us chamber of commerce he also reported 
receiving 5000 from world trade assoc and 2400 from crosby 
assoc 
gottlieb said kemp told him he believed the limits did not apply 
because he was leaving congress and would not receive the checks 
until after he was out of office 
well clearly the limit does apply and when it was pointed out 
to him that it does he turned around and made the appropriate 
adjustment gottlieb said 
gottlieb said kemp agreed to return 8000 each to hartford 
university and the us chamber of commerce 
he agreed to reduce his firing line fee which had not yet 
been received to 2000 per appearance or 4000 total he also 
agreed to reduce the fees for world trade and laffer to 2000 each 
and to forgo altogether the crosby fee brunette said 
because the remaining total still would have exceeded the overall 
house limit on honoraria kemp shifted fees totaling 12500 to 1989 
when he said he actually received or will receive them according 
to both gottlieb and brunette that gave him a 1988 honoraria total 
of just over 26000 and within the limit 
gottlieb said that after consulting with staff of the house 
ethics committee he decided house rules permitted honoraria to be 
counted in the year actually received even though earned in a 
different year 
the manual for house members published by the ethics committee 
states that honoraria may be counted in the year in which they are 
received but it also contains another sentence that raises 
questions about whether this is permitted if the object is to 
circumvent the limit 
a member may therefore not earn income and have it deferred to 
another year or to when he leaves congress to avoid the income 
limitation says the manual titled ethics manual for members 
officers and employees of the us house of representatives 
transferring the excess to 1989 solves kemps problem if he is 
judged to be subject to a limit that is 30 percent of a full years 
income which is gottliebs interpretation of the rules 
house rules describe the limit as 30 percent of the aggregate 
salary received during the year which might give him a limit of 
about 150 since he earned only about 500 as a member of congress 
for two days in 1989 under this interpretation the remainder would 
have to be donated to charity

attorney general dick thornburgh is unlikely to 
grant the rev jesse jacksons request that thornburgh help free two 
imprisoned former maryland legislators while they appeal criminal 
convictions justice department sources said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said it was 
extremely unlikely that thornburgh would intervene to overturn a 
judges ruling on a criminal conviction 
jackson handdelivered a letter to thornburgh last week that 
pleaded for the release of former state sens clarence m mitchell 
iii and michael b mitchell while they appeal 2year prison terms 
for trying to obstruct a congressional investigation of the wedtech 
scandal 
the attorney general said that he would take a look at the 
situation department spokesman loye miller said confirming a 
report published in todays editions of the baltimore sun that 
jackson had appealed to thornburgh for help 
the department sources noted that the trial judges decision to 
deny the mitchell brothers bail pending appeal was upheld by chief 
justice william rehnquist who handles emergency appeals from 
federal courts in maryland 
in the letter jackson said freedom was imperative for the 
mtchells who are nephews of former rep parren mitchell dmd the 
mitchells are the sons of the late clarence mitchell ii who was a 
nationally respected civil rights lawyer 
i have agreed to assume a leadership role in the effort to 
bring national attention to ensure justice in this important case 
jackson wrote in the letter to thornburgh 
he said a federal judges denial of the mitchells request for 
release was unprecedented 
jacksons letter does not directly address racial issues but 
after his meeting with thornburgh last week jackson complained to 
reporters that several white defendants convicted in the wedtech 
scandal including former rep mario biaggo dny remained free 
on bail while the mitchells who are black were ordered to jail 
the two are serving prison terms at the lewisburg federal prison 
camp in lewisburg pa for their november 1987 convictions on 
federal fraud and obstruction charges 
during their trial prosecutors presented evidence they collected 
50000 from the wedtech corp a new yorkbased defense contractor 
to help block an investigation of the firm by the house committee on 
small business then chaired by their uncle

house speaker jim wright moving to limit 
political damage from a proposed 50 percent congressional pay raise 
said today the house would vote next week on cutting the increase to 
30 percent 
wright said the house would also vote on banning members from 
receiving speaking fees and other honoraria because house members 
currently can retain up to 30 percent of salary in honoraria those 
receiving the maximum would receive no actual raise 
the house will vote next week to ban all honorariums and to cut 
the pay raise to 30 percent instead of 50 percent thatll make it 
just come out even wright told reporters 
a 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional salary by 
26850 to a total of 116350 
a democratic leadership aide who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said wright planned for the vote to take place after the 
raise would become law next wednesday this would roll back the 
increase for lawmakers and executive branch officials but not for 
judges whose salary cannot be reduced under the constitution 
the senate planned to vote today or friday and was virtually 
certain to turn down the 50 percent raise which would boost most 
congressional salaries from 89500 to 135000 
minority leader bob michel rill who has met with wright and 
plans further meetings has not signed off on the 30 percent pay 
raise proposal nor the idea of a vote the following day said 
johanna schneider michaels spokeswoman 
wright said of course theres always a chance that his 
proposal would be defeated but he said he was encouraged by answers 
given by 326 house members to a survey he conducted this week on the 
pay raise 
without announcing the results wright said 
they indicate that the members feel that they should give up 
the honororia and they should substitute a straightforward upfront 
way in which they would receive and all other people in the 
government would receive a decent raise but not an exorbitant 
raise and that they ought to vote to do it i think its upbeat 
wright has tried to convince his colleagues for weeks to reduce 
the raise to 30 percent but told reporters previously the members 
were privately telling him they wanted 50 percent without a vote 
the raise becomes law unless both houses of congress vote to stop it 
wright appeared to be going along with these private sentiments 
until he abruptly reversed course this week and ordered the survey 
aides said the speaker was tired of reading that he was stopping the 
will of a majority to vote on the raise 
an associated press informal survey of nearly a third of the 
435member house showed about 88 percent of those responding wanted 
a vote on the larger package 
groups opposed to the increase said their own survey showed that 
slightly more than 60 percent would vote no 
meanwhile house and senate negotiators moved ahead wednesday 
with separate but similar proposals to bar speaking fees and 
restrict other outside income should the raise become law 
a bipartisan draft document given to senators and obtained by 
the associated press compared the latest house and senate proposals 
on outside income 
both packages would ban honoraria including fees for speeches 
appearances and articles upon enactment of the raise 
leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would 
continue if the pay raise is defeated because members dont want to 
suffer a loss of income house members currently can retain 26850 
and senate members 35800 in honoraria 
the senate plan includes a contingency that would permit 
retention of some honoraria if the raise is partially scaled back 
later 
the plans under discussion in both houses would permit such fees 
to be donated to charity on a members behalf the senate plan would 
limit the donation to 2000 per appearance and require members to 
list on financial disclosure forms the amount the payer and the 
recipient of the donation 
wright did not get full cooperation from his colleagues in his 
survey house republican whip dick cheney rwyo told his hometown 
paper the casper startribune i didnt return the form i dont 
do polls 
the associated press contacted 143 congressional offices and 
found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay 
raise only six said they were against it and seven were undecided 
there was no response from 38 offices 
the survey released wednesday by raise opponents indicating 62 
percent of house members opposed to the increase was conducted by 
public citizen a consumer advocacy group founded by ralph nader 
and two conservative groups the national taxpayers union and 
coalitions for america 
the proposed honoraria plans would allow groups that invite 
members to an event to continue paying for travel the senate would 
direct its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining 
acceptable limits 
the house draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension 
benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation the senate 
plan would go further prohibiting conversion of any of the 
donations to a members personal use 
the house plan would limit all outside earned income to 15 
percent of a members salary half the current 30 percent 
the house also would end a provision in federal law that has 
allowed 190 house members in office before 1980 to accumulate 39 
million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use 
the measure would become effective in january 1991 giving house 
members one chance to retire with the money the senate already has 
a rule prohibiting such conversion

the judge in oliver l norths irancontra 
trial added two more people to a pool of prospective jurors today 
while rejecting two others including a woman who said she recalled 
seeing the former white house aide on television when he gave 
immunized testimony to congress 
a woman who worked for the navy for 21 years and a clerk typist 
at the labor department were sent into the jury pool which now has 
18 people out of a group that us district judge gerhard gesell 
wants to build to 50 by the end of the week 
prospective jurors have been instructed not to read watch or 
listen to anything about the case 
the former navy employee now a secretary said she didnt even 
turn the television on when she went home wednesday night 
because if i had i would have had to tell a lie i dont want to 
go to jail 
the woman said her main source of news was talking to other 
people and that her husband thought north was somehow messing 
up she said she thought norths activities involved something 
about weapons selling weapons to the overseas people 
the clerk typist a woman in her 20s said she had heard teenie 
bits of norths 1987 congressional testimony in news broadcasts 
but that i did not pay attention i saw it and turned the 
channel north attorney barry simon said the woman should not be 
included as a juror because she saw norths testimony but 
gesell said the woman heard it only enough time to turn it off 
rejected for the pool was a contracts supervisor at the 
governments general services administration who said she recalled 
that north had been involved in sending some guns to another 
country although she could not remember the country 
the gsa employee also said she recalled something about north 
lying to the committee i just heard that vaguely 
five of the criminal counts against north charge that he 
obstructed and made false statements to congressional panels in 1985 
and 1986 by denying he was assisting the contra rebels fighting the 
leftist government of nicaragua at a time when us military aid to 
the contras had been banned 
the prospective juror said she wasnt interested in norths 1987 
testimony but i saw him on tv 
also rejected for the pool was a man who said i do not know 
that much about the north case but didnt think he could be a 
fair and impartial juror 
gesell had said wednesday he wants to start picking a jury monday 
after rounding up a pool of 50 prospective panelists before the 
weekend 
so far 18 people have been identified who remained largely 
unexposed to norths nationally televised congressional testimony in 
1987 in that testimony the fired white house aide discussed many 
activities for which he now faces criminal charges 
north was granted immunity from prosecution for that testimony 
norths lawyers say any exposure whatsoever to that testimony 
would violate their clients fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh 
was required to gather information for the criminal charges 
independently of any congressionally immunized testimony 
on wednesday gesell sent nine people into the pool of 
prospective jurors saying i think it has gone very well so far 
seven prospective jurors were identified on tuesday after the trial 
opened 
gesell said he hopes to pick a pool of 50 by friday have the 
prosecution and defense prepare for indepth questioning and move 
for jury selection monday 
gesell has been calling into court for initial questioning only 
those people who say they didnt see read or listen to norths 
congressional testimony in 1987 
even with those restrictions norths lawyers objected to almost 
all the 16 who were sent into the jury pool on the grounds that 
they had been exposed to news accounts of norths 1987 testimony 
north faces 12 criminal charges 
he is accused of lying to congress in 1985 and 1986 about his 
efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras and of lying to the 
attorney general the about the national security councils role in 
diverting money from the iran arms sales to the contras 
he also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
by using a taxexempt foundation to funnel money to the contras

us officials said thursday they are 
still planning this years joint military exercises with south korea 
despite north korean protests north korea said the maneuvers have 
already begun 
north korea has called for eliminating the exercises as a 
precondition for continuing a peace dialogue with seoul but it made 
no mention thursday of cancelling upcoming talks 
the us command in seoul played down the exercises it refused 
to confirm this years maneuvers would be held but acknowledged that 
us and south korean officers began planning on the training many 
months ago and that planning continues 
south korean defense minister lee sanghoon said on state 
television wednesday that the team spirit exercises will be 
carried out as planned 
he said however that us and south korean officials may 
consider adjusting the scale and format of future exercises if north 
korea shows a concrete change of attitude toward seoul he did 
not elaborate 
the exercises have been conducted annually since 1976 to test the 
joint command of us and south korean forces in the event of a 
north korean invasion the maneuvers usually begin in early february 
and end in midapril 
announcement of past exercises were made well before the 
maneuvers began this year however south korea asked the united 
states to delay a formal announcement until later this month to help 
promote its dialogue with north korea 
north koreas official korean central news agency monitored in 
tokyo said thursday the united states and south korea committed a 
nevertobe condoned crime in starting the exercises as the north 
koreasouth korea talks approach 
it said preliminary talks for highlevel political and military 
discussions were scheduled for feb 8 and legislators were to meet 
feb 10 to prepare for a largescale parliamentary meeting 
the agency said the exercise clearly proves once again that the 
us imperialists and their stooges do not want peace and peaceful 
reunification of korea and have not yet awakened from an 
anachronistic dream to invade the north

new home sales edged up a meager 09 percent 
last year the government said thursday in a report analysts cited 
as evidence that higher mortgage interest rates continue to dampen 
activity in the housing market 
sales for all of 1988 totaled 677000 dwellings up from 671000 
sold during the previous year the commerce department reported 
home sales had plunged 105 percent in 1987 with the drop blamed on 
rising interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong 
sales years 
analysts said they expected continued increases in interest rates 
and a slowdown in the economy to result in a modest decrease in new 
home sales this year 
the bottoms not falling out of the market by any means but we 
do expect a modest slowing said economist richard peach of the 
mortgage bankers association 
fixedrate mortgages last week stood at 106 percent up from 
1016 percent a year earlier according to a survey by the federal 
home loan mortgage corp many economists are predicting interest 
rates could hit 115 percent by the middle of this year 
last years new home sales ended with a slight upturn as sales 
for december rose 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 669000 after dropping 79 percent during the previous month 
all of decembers strength came from the northeast where sales 
rose a surprising 529 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 104000 sales were down 221 percent in the midwest 2 percent 
in the south and 13 percent in the west 
however for the year overall the northeast was the only region 
to post a decline with sales down 137 percent to 101000 sales 
were up 97 percent in the west 11 percent in the south and 1 
percent in the midwest 
analysts were puzzled by the december surge in the northeast 
saying it might be due to unusually mild weather and difficulties 
with seasonal adjustments during the winter months 
the northeast clearly is fundamentally a weakening part of the 
country with the west probably still on balance a strengthening 
part of the country said david seiders chief economist for the 
national association of home builders 
analysts said the slackening in the northeast was coming on the 
heels of several years in which a sales boom resulted in 
overbuilding and drove up prices figures for the west meanwhile 
have been dominated by strength in california where the healthy 
economy and a fear of future restrictions on development are 
spurring sales 
people are trying to buy now and get in now and builders are 
doing the same thing in hopes that they wont be curtailed by 
slowgrowth or nogrowth initiatives peach said 
nationwide the median price of a new home rose 97 percent in 
december to 121000 meaning half the homes sold for more and half 
for less the average price of a new home also was up rising 111 
percent to 152200 
seiders said the december increase in prices was largely due to 
the shift of sales to the more expensive northeast rather than a 
national trend toward a surging prices 
for the year the median price of a new home was 112500 up 77 
percent from a year earlier the average price was 138300 up 87 
percent

with the wave of a sacred evergreen branch 
over an altar covered with vegetables seaweed and dried squid a 
shinto priest prayed thursday for the safety of the first 
hightechnology boeing 747400 jumbo jet to enter commercial service 
the whiterobed priest competed with departure announcements 
inside an airport lounge overlooking the new plane at tokyos narita 
airport as he chanted prayers for the jet the latest version of 
the boeing 747 and for the prosperity of its owner northwest 
airlines 
this is the most technologically sophisticated commercial 
aircraft to enter the skies said allen johnson northwests vice 
president for the pacific it will set the pace for commercial air 
travel through the 1990s 
the plane received by northwest last week is the first 747400 
to be delivered by boeing and the first of 10 ordered by the 
airline it arrived in tokyo on wednesday on a test flight carrying 
five northwest pilots and four officials of the us federal 
aviation administration 
following the blessing by the priest who was hired by northwest 
johnson and other northwest executives offered sacred boughs at the 
altar and bowed and clapped twice a standard prayer in japans 
animist shinto religion 
airlines have eagerly awaited the boeing 747400 distinctive 
for its curved wingtips and extralong upper deck because of its 
reduced fuel consumption and twomember flight crews compared with 
the threemember crews needed on other 747s 
but critics of the planes including some pilots unions have 
questioned the safety of the smaller crews which do without a 
flight engineer 
i feel very confident that this plane will be as safe or safer 
than the earlier 747s said capt dennis boston northwests 
manager of flight standards for the 747400 
in the cockpit multicolored video displays reminiscent of video 
games replace many of the usual gauges sophisticated computers 
monitor thousands of sensors throughout the airplane and display 
the planes route and location and keep track of radio signals from 
check points along the way 
you might say we now have an electronic equivalent of a flight 
engineer on the plane said joseph ebli northwests manager of 
747400 maintenance its like something that you saw in star 
wars its a military concept that is being introduced in 
commercial planes 
boeings worldwide delivery of the planes has been delayed for 
more than a month by bugs in the sophisticated computer software 
that resulted in false computer messages but the problems have been 
solved boston said 
i am very confident in the airplane i think theyve done an 
excellent job he said 
northwest plans to put the 747400 into regular service in the 
united states and between new york and tokyo after its faarequired 
proving flights are completed probably in the spring 
northwests order of 10 planes including spare parts is valued 
at about 2 billion

the fbi is questioning officials at the 
morehouse university school of medicine about health and human 
services secretarydesignate louis sullivans connection to a former 
georgia official convicted of extortion 
the fbi is inquiring about former fulton county commissioner 
reginald eaves who was involved in a financial conflictofinterest 
scandal at the atlanta school where sullivan is president 
dr james goodman executive vice president of the morehouse 
medical school said the fbi talked to me about a range of issues 
about dr sullivans fitness for the position of hhs secretary 
including that eaves and many other things he declined to say 
what other issues the fbi questioned him about 
meanwhile sullivan wants white house permission to maintain his 
connection with the medical school while he serves the bush 
administration as secretary of health and human services according 
to published reports 
the washington post and the washington times today quoted sources 
as saying sullivan requested that he be permitted to take a 
sabbatical as president of the school possibly with pay acting hhs 
secretary donald m newman told a staff meeting wednesday that 
administration officials initially approved the request but later 
reversed themselves the post said 
the post said morehouse sources understood the reversal ruled out 
a paid sabbatical while sullivan is at hhs but not necessarily an 
unpaid leave 
white house counsel c boyden gray told the times that nothing 
has been approved the white house lawyers are looking into his 
sullivans requests regarding leave retirement and sabbatical 
policy and will work something out that doesnt violate government 
ethics 
sabbaticals are traditionally given in academic institutions over 
seven years to senior professors to conduct research at full pay 
hhs officials said that in the past academic figures have 
frequently taken unpaid leaves from their institutions to work at 
hhs for a period of time but not sabbaticals 
the white house earlier this week requested that congress 
postpone sullivans confirmation hearing saying that the financial 
disclosure statements and fbi background check were not completed 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said he did not know whether 
eaves connection to morehouse was the reason for the delay the fbi 
had no immediate comment 
the school paid eaves 675 a month for about four years as a 
guest lecturer while he promoted the schools positions on several 
issues before the commission goodman said he did not know how often 
eaves lectured at the school 
eaves was convicted last may on extortion charges 
aides to the senate finance and labor and human resources 
committees which will hold hearings on sullivans nomination said 
they were unaware of sullivans connection to eaves

president bush said today that there is no 
greater peace than that which comes from prayer and later jokingly 
predicted that those who pray for him to land in hot water will have 
their prayers answered 
the president speaking to the national prayer breakfast mixed 
serious talk about the value of prayer with jokes about critics and 
his pledge to encourage a kinder gentler nation 
bush said he prays daily and there is no greater peace than 
that which comes from prayer and no greater fellowship than to join 
in prayer with others 
bush had canceled a speech wednesday to the national association 
of religious broadcasters because of laryngitis he was hoarse this 
morning during his brief talk at the prayer breakfast 
shouldnt we also remember that for all we have to be grateful 
for to pause each day to offer a prayer of thanksgiving bush 
told the gathering of more than 4000 people including dozens of 
elected and appointed officials all of us should not try to 
fulfill the responsibilities we now have without prayer and a strong 
faith in god 
bush then turned to humor first recalling a story the rev billy 
graham had told him about milking a cow in his boyhood days in north 
carolina 
graham bush said had been told it was a kind and gentle cow 
but he got whacked in the eye by the cows tail and nearly kicked 
when he tried to milk it 
its one thing to request it its another thing to see it 
actually happen bush said maybe a lot of folks out there are 
thinking that if you folks in washington stop trying to milk us 
well stop kicking the president said to laughter from the 
audience 
on a more serious note bush said if were to walk together 
toward a more caring and a more generous amercia let us all share 
in paving the way with prayer 
bush also told a joke about a young boy whose grandmother was 
always complaining about being cold and the boys prayer to make 
it hot for grandmother 
i suppose there may be some people in washington and all over 
the country who have already begun to pray make it hot for 
george bush said those prayers will be answered in time be 
patient 
bush had a tough act to follow sen alan simpson rwyo 
simpson told several jokes that brought roars from the gathering 
including one about a boy whose mother during a mass pointed out a 
memorial to the boys who died in the service 
which one the 9 oclock or the 11 oclock the boy asked 
simpson also brought down the house by saying those who travel 
the high road of humility in washington are not troubled by heavy

put motorcycles and bicycles out of the range of many nigerians 
prompting some to turn to donkeys

overnight temperatures in the region had dropped to 20 degrees 
below zero or more 
greg mitchell of rock lake a volunteer in the search effort 
came upon stebletons car shortly before 11 am today the vehicle 
was on a lightly travthat was blocked by a snowdrift 
the boy was coherent when he was rescued but was badly 
frostbitten on his feet and hands mitchell said he was listed in 
serious condieled rural road tion at towner county memorial hospital in 
cando 
about 20 to 25 people both officers and volunteers helped in 
the search soderberg said 
stebleton had driven to devils lake on monday to take his older 
brother to the amtrak station there soderberg said the brother was 
going to fargo to take a military preinduction physical the 
sheriff said 
stebletons parents were already in fargo visiting a sick 
relative and discovered the boy was missing after th im trying to 
invest it wisely i never had that much before 
and a couple of times i was down on hard times she said 
recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for 30 a 
week 
john d flowers an assistant high school principal from 
barboursville wva has followed a similar playitsafe pattern 
after winning 2 million in the west virginia lottery in the spring 
of 1986 
flowers 40 who continues working but whose wife quit her job 
said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house 
on his accountants advice 10 percent was placed in a taxdeferred 
retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three 
childrens college education 
a small amount was invested in mutual funds and shortterm 
taxfree municipal bonds flowers like some other lottery winners 
interviewed has avoided stocks 
this has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our 
overall worry level said flowers 
most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher 
living standard long after the lottery checks cease 
tax expert jane feola scaccetti who has counseled lottery 
winners says that can easily be done through diversified 
investments but her first advice is that clients take things slow 
its the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of 
money said ms scaccetti a tax partner with the philadelphia 
accounting firm laventhol amp horwath you usually try to slow the 
pace down apply all the sound financial decision process as you 
would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of 
time 
for the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep 
the money in highyielding cds or treasury bills ms scaccetti 
said some banks such as northern trust co in chicago offer 
special accounts for clients who suddenly have 1 million or more 
and need a place to park it 
of course lottery winners also should be looking for ways to 
shelter themselves from taxes such as taxfree municipal bonds or 
annuities ms scaccetti said 
later on they need to ask themselves do i need to have a 
fixed return because i want to give up working or do i want to 
continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside she said 
dick zimmermann 39 a former abc news producer from the san 
francisco bay area fell in both categories after winning 976 
million in the california lottery a year ago 
although his annual net income of 500000 has kept himself and 
his wife out of the work force theyve been cautious 
zimmermann opted for investments most likely to appreciate like 
a new 425000 3bedroom house and a 1964 rolls royce silver cloud 
iii for tax reasons zimmermann obtained a 15year home mortgage 
rather than paying cash 
were trying to be good stewards of this money he said 
after all this sort of thing doesnt even come once in a 
lifetime your chances of being struck by lightning are four times 
better

the house judiciary committee today ousted the 
chairman of its immigration subcommittee veteran rep romano l 
mazzoli dky in favor of fourthterm rep bruce a morrison 
dconn 
mazzoli a 10term congressman from louisville who headed the 
subcommittee for eight years authored with sen alan k simpson 
rwyo the sweeping simpsonmazzoli immigration reform of 1986 
mazzoli was ousted on a 16ballot vote of 
democratic members of the full committee after speaking on his own 
behalf according to congres5 secret paper sional sources morrison who 
was next 
in line of seniority was voted in 211 
mazzoli who will stay on as a subcommittee member did not 
immediately return telephone calls from the associated press 
plans to oust the sitting chairman a rare occurrence on capitol 
hill had been discussed quietly among committee democrats since the 
november elections according to morrison 
democratic discontent with mazzoli had been growing over the way 
he ran the panel according to morrison 
there are policy issues that mazzoli and other members of the 
democratic caucus might or might not have agreed on but thats not 
what motivated the votes morrison said in an interview following 
the closeddoor meetingneeds 
it is the responsibility of the democratic chairman to give 
first responsibility to his caucus morrison said the ranking 
republican is in charge of looking out for republicans 
this is not the first time mazzoli has had troubles with 
democratic colleagues 
in 1985 mazzoli voted with republicans and spoke out on the 
house floor over the highly charged partisan issue of the results of 
a hotly contested house race in indiana that resulted in a 
diminishing of his power on immigration issues and left many 
democrats with bad feelings 
but others pointed to ideological differences between mazzoli and 
other committee democrats as the chief reason for the change in 
leadership 
mazzoli is more conservative than most of the committees 
democratic members said rep judiciary is a more liberal committee 
and is not ideologically 
representative of congress

a man who sued the transit authority for 2 
million claiming a bus accident left him so weak he needed a cane to 
walk withdrew his claim after the ta showed the judge a videotape 
of him changing a tire 
the case arose from an accident feb 27 1983 in which a bus 
rearended a car driven by ali hanafi of the borough of queens 
the man claimed that he was reduced to walking with a shuffle 
with the aid of a cane and that he had lost so much strength in his 
upper body that he could no longer work as a counterman at a pizza 
joint said ta spokesman jared lebow his lawyer actually 
claimed in court that he was too weak to lift pizza dough 
barry f bernstein a lawyer for hanafi who has since changed 
his name to steven haig put haig on the stand and called doctors to 
testify that he suffered post traumatic stress disorder 
on wednesday bernstein offered to settle the case for 
250000 lebow said we declined 
ta lawyer michael figliolia then produced the videotape which 
was shown while the jury was out of the courtroom 
the tape made jan 25 showed haig changing a tire while 
bernstein watched 
the tire must have weighed 40 pounds and he used one hand to 
throw it in the trunk and bernstein stood around watching 
figliolia said 
when the tape ended haig withdrew his claim and the judge 
dismissed the case 
lebow said the videotape would be turned over to the district 
attorney and to the appellate division because we feel the 
attorney should be subject to some discipline because he was 
supporting a phony claim 
the telephone company had no listing for a steven haig a number 
for ali hanafi was unlisted he could not be reached for comment 
bernstein defended his client saying he was hit in the rear 
and he went straight to the hospital he was taken straight from the 
scene by ambulance he was unconscious 
when asked if haig was still suffering bernstein replied his 
doctors say he is 
asked why haig withdrew the claim bernstein said it was his 
decision 
last year there were 3228 injury claims filed against the ta and 
386 million was paid out either in judgments or settlements

rep kika de la garza chairman of the house 
agriculture committee urged farmers thursday to buy crop insurance 
and follow every known practice of moisture conservation because 
critical drought conditions still prevail across portions of the 
midwest the west and south texas 
de la garza a texas democrat and norton d strommen chief 
meteorologist for the agriculture department said that they are 
concerned about the winter wheat crop but that with good early 
spring rains this years harvest could be a good crop 
specific areas of concern they listed are the texas and oklahoma 
panhandles south texas rangeland and pockets of the corn belt from 
eastern iowa and western illinois southwest into kansas 
as farmers prepare for planting this year their planning needs 
to include every possible moisturesaving measure the utilization 
of droughtresistant plant varieties and a serious look at crop 
insurance said de la garza 
although recent snow in the west is a positive sign it is not 
anything that would ease the situation de la garza said 
the projection for winter wheat is still a question mark he 
said there may be some injury with the extreme cold weather but 
we cant tell yet overall the projection is guarded but somewhat 
positive 
strommen said the situation in the winter wheat belt is 
encouragingly optimistic with short and longrange forecasts 
calling for normal amounts of precipitation 
with good rains in early spring we have the potential for 
seeing a significant revival of the crops condition and the 
potential for a good crop

it seems to be getting rainier south of the 
equator unlike the north where the moisture trend has been mixed 
according to a new climate study 
the report in the january edition of the journal of geophysical 
research atmospheres covers more than a century of weather 
records and indicates increased rainfall at southern hemisphere 
measuring stations 
such a finding would be consistent with the recently popular 
theory of a greenhouselike warming of the climate the study noted 
the greenhouse theory holds that carbon dioxide and other gases 
being added to the atmosphere by humans will trap an increasing 
amount of the suns heat tending to warm the earth somewhat like a 
greenhouse warms its interior warmer weather evaporating more water 
from the ocean could then lead to more rain 
but rs bradley of the university of massachusetts one of the 
authors of the new report was reluctant to tie the findings to that 
theory 
were tending to stay away from that issue we dont want to 
imply its related in any way were just presenting the observed 
data bradley said thursday in a telephone interview 
nonetheless the report noted that computer models of possible 
greenhouse effect changes do call for increased precipitation over 
the southern hemisphere 
in addition to the increased rainfall the new report found 
indications of higher seasurface temperatures and increased wind 
speeds over the southern oceans which could lead to more 
evaporation and thus more rain 
those findings could also be a result of variations in instrument 
readings however the study said it noted that because the 
southern hemisphere is primarily watercovered there are far fewer 
weather measuring sites than in the more landcovered north 
the strongest rainfall increase was detected in south america 
while there was a lesser effect in australia and south asia and no 
trend was evident for southern africa the report said 
the study contrasts with a 1987 analysis covering areas north of 
the equator which had more mixed results that report found 
increased rainfall in temperate northern areas but a decline in rain 
in the tropics north of the equator 
bradley noted that while the new findings indicate increased 
rainfall in southern hemisphere measurig points that doesnt 
necessarily translate to an overall increase in wetness for the 
planets southern half 
the findings could be reversed if precipitation has declined over 
the vast southern ocean areas where no measurements are taken the 
study said 
in addition bradley noted that rainfall and what amounts to an 
increase can vary quite a lot from place to place a small increase 
in rain over the amazon basin for example could amount to a 
decadeworth of moisture for the northern chile desert for example 
he said 
overall the new analysis concluded that rain falling on land 
areas in the southern hemisphere has increased since the 1940s 
including an increase in the temperate latitudes starting in the 
1970s 
the report was prepared by bradley henry f diaz of the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administrations environmental research 
laboratories and j k eischeid of the university of colorado

the city has lost its bid to tax the 
neighboring city of burlington for using airspace over winooski 
a twojudge panel ruled wednesday against winooskis unusual 
lawsuit in which the city tried to make burlington pay 90222 for 
the airspace used by planes at the burlington international airport 
the lawsuit said the takeoffs and landings interfere with 
winooski property owners enjoyment of land and constitutes taking 
of winooski land by burlington 
chittenden county superior court judge matthew katz and assistant 
judge elizabeth gretkowski rejected that reasoning 
although air rights over land may be bought sold developed 
and taxed such rights do not include airport runway cones for 
takeoff and landing they ruled 
winooski officials said they were glad the case was taken 
seriously although they were disappointed with the outcome 
well appeal as far as im concerned said mayor ronald 
lacourse adding that the city council would have to vote to appeal 
the lawsuit was filed in march 1988 nearly two years after 
winooski sent the tax bill to burlington 
winooski residents bothered by the noise from planes readily 
backed the suit its aggravating one resident james shea 
said of the noise it always happens right in the middle of the 
best tv shows

spokesman said thursday 
the new quantum wire transistor uses wires onetenth the 
thickness of those in conventional transistors a company spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity the new wires are five millionths of 
a millimeter thick he said 
the new transistor can be used to perform calculations at six 
times the speed possible with existing high electronic mobility 
transistors the spokesman said 
he also said the small size of the new transistor would permit 
the development of laptop highspeed computers 
the transistor also could be used to develop more sophisticated

the nations most romantic cities 
of course the california company korbel champagne cellars put 
san francisco at no 1

sales figures for flowers diamonds and champagne 
san francisco had the greatest number of fine restaurants and 
movie theaters per capita as well as high scores in virtually every 
other romance category 
in second place was honolulu primarily because it had the

one of the houses most conservative members 
joined with one of the most liberal thursday to announce legislation 
against surrogate mother arrangements in which a woman is paid to 
conceive a child 
the measure introduced by reps barbara boxer dcalif and 
henry hyde rill contains no sanctions against the woman or the 
person who pays her to have a child 
instead it is aimed primarily at brokers who take a fee to link 
women willing to have a baby for pay with couples willing to pay for 
a child it calls for a maximum penalty of five years in prison and 
a 50000 fine for conviction of such brokering and provides that 
such contracts are unenforceable 
introduction of the bill came one day before the first 
anniversary of the famous baby m case in which the new jersey 
supreme court ruled that a surrogate mother contract could not be 
enforced 
while the legislation is designed to effectively end 
commercialized surrogatemother contracts even if no broker is 
involved boxer and hyde said they did not propose criminal 
penalities for either the mother or the person who pays her because 
they consider both to be victims 
in the case of surrogancy there is a desperate childless 
couple and a surrogate mother desperate for money said boxer 
into this circumstance a commercial brokerage business has emerged 
which could lead to the creation of a new class of women in our 
society paid breeders and eventually a new class of children who 
will be forced to accept the reality that their natural mothers sold 
them 
hyde said the practice of paying a woman to have a baby smacks of 
slavery 
by reducing childbearing to an occupation surrogancy 
arrangements attack the essential human dignity of every person 
said hyde 
the two representatives were joined at a news conference by 
jeremy rifkin cochairman of the national coalition against 
surrogancy 
commercialized childbearing denigrates human dignity because it 
places a commercial bond before a maternal bond said rifkin 
the boxerhyde bill technically applies only to surrogate mother 
arrangements in which interstate commerce is involved but attorneys 
said the courts have given such a broad interpretation to interstate 
commerce that the bill effectively would stop almost all commercial 
surrogate mother contracts if it becomes law 
hyde is a leading opponent of abortion and boxer is a staunch 
proponent of a womans right to have an abortion 
both turned aside questions about their differences on that issue 
and said just because they generally were at opposite poles on the 
conservativeliberal spectrum did not mean they did not respect each 
other and could not work together 
after boxer went out of her way to praise hydes integrity hyde 
said he had always thought of her as an honest liberal because she 
is tolerant of different views

the rev jesse jackson said thursday the west can 
test soviet reforms by cooperating in fundraisers for armenian 
earthquake victims monitoring human rights cases and visiting 
factories converting from military to consumer production 
i believe that at every level of glasnost and perestroika there 
must be verification said the former democratic presidential 
contender who is visiting the soviet union for the first time 
the more people can see the transition taking place the more 
people can be relieved of the cold war tensions that have 
characterized our relationship for the last 40 years jackson said 
jackson said he had seen signs of president mikhail gorbachevs 
reforms during a trip to the armenian earthquake zone in 
conversations with soviet officals and in a visit to a mig fighter 
plane plant being converted to produce household appliances 
jackson arrived in the soviet union on sunday to promote his plan 
for a joint sovietamerican telethon to aid victims of the december 
earthquake in armenia and to assess the economic and political 
reforms under gorbachev 
jackson said he had asked to see a military factory being 
transformed to make consumer goods because gorbachev mentioned such 
plants in a dec 7 speech to the united nations 
we could see on one side the production line making the migs 
on the other side we could see where they were making the new 
equipment for the conversion jackson said 
he said the plant would soon shift its production to washing 
machines blenders and other household products 
during a meeting with alexander m yakovlev a member of the 
politburo jackson discussed the upcoming trials of five members of 
the karabakh committee who were arrested in connection with ethnic 
unrest that has been festering between armenians and azerbaijanis 
for the past year 
jackson said yakovlev assured him the trials would be open to the 
press 
jackson also said four jewish refuseniks have been granted 
permission to leave the country thursday he said one of the 
requests of his group was to gain exit visas for some soviet jews 
but said he did not know the names of the four 
during a trip to armenia earlier this week he viewed the 
devastation from the dec 7 earthquake and visited victims in 
hospitals 
the crisis in armenia becomes a real test for glasnost 
perestroika and for our americas own humanity jackson told a 
news conference 
jackson said he also met with the soviet minister of culture and 
the head of gostelradio the soviet state broadcasting committee to 
discuss the quake fundraiser but that no concrete plans had been 
made or date set 
but american celebrities like cher mike tyson and bill cosby 
have said they want to take part and gorbachev has indicated soviet 
artists will be allowed to participate jackson said 
he said the money will go to rebuild schools hospitals churches 
and set up prefabricated homes for some of the more than 500000 
people left homeless by the quake which killed 25000 people

the chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
on thursday criticized president bushs exclusion of drug 
czardesignate williiam j bennett from the cabinet as a crucial 
mistake 
sen joseph r biden jr the chairman said his committee would 
hold hearings on bennetts nomination march 1 and 2 biden said he 
would have preferred to start the hearings earlier but agreed to 
later dates to give bennett who has no staff time to prepare for 
the congressional questioning 
biden used the announcement to criticize bennetts omission from 
bushs cabinet 
im worried that the president has made a crucial mistake 
maybe in part by oversight by not having the drug coordinator at 
the table said biden a delaware democrat 
the director of national drug control policy which will be the 
drug czars formal title has to do what none of the others in 
the cabinet has to do said biden he has to take them on as a 
practical matter he is entering the most dangerous world in 
washington and that is the world of fiefdoms 
in establishing a national drug control policy the director will 
be called upon to develop a strategy covering more than 30 agencies 
spread throughout the federal government and under the more direct 
control of individual secretaries who are in the cabinet 
bush has defended his decision to leave bennett out of the 
cabinet saying the reason he isnt in the cabinet is that ive 
tried to reduce down the numbers of full cabinet members and i 
think that bill bennetts time is best spent not worrying about 
agricultural subsidies but concentrating on drugs 
sen orrin g hatch rutah argued bushs position at the 
committee meeting and said bennett must have the backing of the 
president and he will 
biden acknowldeged i have no right nor does the senate have a 
right to tell him who will sit at his cabinet table but i think 
its a tragic mistake a terrible mistake if he continues that 
policy 
john walters an aide to bennett has said bennett didnt 
consider the decision a serious problem 
we have no doubt about george bushs seriousness about the drug 
issue and his seriousness about his commitment to bill bennett as 
the guy in charge of this issue walters said 
biden said that once bennett is confirmed he must begin work 
immediately on developing a plan that has never been developed 
in the history of the united states of america and that is a 
comprehensive drug plan which is due 180 days after the drug czar 
is confirmed biden said

the government on thursday criticized greenpeace 
after a ship from the environmental group tangled for a week with 
japanese whalers in the antarctic 
the greenpeace ship gondwana left the whaling fleet thursday 
after giving the japanese whaleshaped gingerbread cookies with a 
note if you want to eat whales eat these according to group 
spokesman paul bogart 
the gondwana had been trying to prevent four japanese ships from 
whaling in the antarctic ocean on tuesday the gondwana collided 
with the japanese mother ship the 23000ton nisshin maru no 3 
but there were no injuries and little damage 
i understand greenpeace is conducting obstructive activities 
while the research whaling fleet is conducting legal and legitimate 
activities foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said 
thursday 
as the research ships activities are in line with 
international whaling commission guidelines those obstructive 
activities are unjustifiable watanabe told reporters at a weekly 
news conference 
greenpeace said thursday it had filmed the japanese whaling fleet 
while it harpooned and electrocuted minke whales it said it would 
give the film to the whaling commission 
bogart interviewed by radio telephone aboard the gondwana 
called the cookie packages a parting gift 
he said the note attached to the cookies also read we bear no 
animosity to the japanese people or members of the japanese ships 
he said one of the japanese boats relayed a message thanking 
greenpeace for the package 
japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its 
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks 
such research is allowed under a moratorium imposed by the 
international whaling commission the regulations are to be 
reevaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research 
however greenpeace contends most of the whale meat taken by 
japanese boats will end up in sushi restaurants in japan 
japanese whaling and government officials have accused greenpeace 
of engaging in terrorist tactics and endangering lives however 
watanabe said thursday use of that word was regrettable 
greenpeace said its presence temporarily halted the hunt and drew 
international attention to the plight of whales the group estimated 
the japanese had harpooned 55 minke whales 
in wellington new zealand greenpeace supporters in 
bloodspattered overalls on thursday delivered bags of imitation 
whale meat to the japanese embassy and cultural center to protest 
the whale kill 
greenpeace said thursday its ship was headed toward a us base 
on antarcticas mcmurdo sound the group says that area has been 
badly polluted

china and the soviet union reached agreement 
thursday on many aspects of the conflict in cambodia which has 
clouded efforts to end 30 years of bad blood between the two 
communist giants 
soviet embassy spokesman vv duhin said the consensus removed 
cambodia as an impediment to normalization of ties 
the chinese were more cautious li zhaoxing spokesman for the 
chinese foreign ministry said the cambodian question is still a 
major item for the bilateral discussions 
foreign minister qian qichen said the nations agreed on many 
aspects of the problem 
our understanding has been increased as have the number of 
points we agree upon he said in a speech thursday night at a 
banquet for his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze 
shevardnadze arrived wednesday for a threeday visit to plan the 
first chinasoviet summit in 30 years 
the foreign ministers agreed thursday that international 
supervision is needed to ensure peace in cambodia after vietnam ends 
its occupation which began in late 1978 with an invasion that 
replaced the chinesebacked khmer rouge with a prohanoi regime 
last month china and vietnam agreed in principle that vietnam 
would withdraw its troops from cambodia by september and that china 
would gradually reduce its aid to the guerrilla groups 
china has called for an armed supervisory force to oversee the 
withdrawal but vietnam has rejected that plan 
qian and shevardnadze agreed the guerrilla factions and the 
vietnamesebacked government should be allowed to determine 
cambodias political makeup without outside interference but both 
countries implied they want a say in cambodias interim government 
which will undoubtebly affect the future cambodian state 
details of the consensus remaining points were not released 
the soviet news agency tass reported the two sides also agreed to 
set up a group to negotiate reduction of arms and troops in the 
border areas the site of a small war in 1969 
in a speech later to the banquet shevardnadze called for joint 
ventures between china and the soviet union cooperation in science 
and technology and transformation of their border into a region of 
peace friendship and goodneighborly cooperation 
he painted a broad picture of moscows hopes for its relations 
with beijing after the summit between soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and chinese leader deng xiaoping 
if the summit takes place moscows relations with beijing would 
reach a level not seen since the 1950s when thousands of soviet 
advisers worked in china the nations clashed over ideology and 
personal matters in 1960 
shevardnadze said he understood ties could never return to their 
previous form when beijing played the younger sibling to moscow 
chinese and russians used to love an old song on the 
transsiberian railroad many years ago he said but time 
changes and gives us new songs and just as songs change so must 
the relationship between the soviet union and china 
relations began to improve in the early 1980s as china began a 
reform program and after gorbachev took power in 1985 
on friday shevardnadze will meet again with qian and then hold 
talks with chinese premier li peng friday night he will fly to 
shanghai to meet deng

after four days of confirmation hearings 
senators remained uneasy thursday with assurances from defense 
secretarydesignate john tower that he could avoid conflicts of 
interests stemming from more than 1 million he received as defense 
consultant 
the senate armed services committee postponed a confirmation vote 
to consult with the fbi about an investigation it conducted into 
towers professional and private lives including persistent 
complaints that he had a drinking problem and was a womanizer 
on wednesday tower denied that he had a drinking problem and 
senators emerging from a closeddoor session said they had received 
assurances there were no other difficulties stemming from his 
private life 
sen trent lott rmiss a member of the committee described 
the information as different and still relatively old asked 
whether it dealt with towers personal or professional life lott 
said possibilities in both areas 
sen carl levin dmich said during questioning wednesday that 
he had not yet seen information he had requested from the fbi 
most of the concern expressed by senators during the hearings 
related to possible conflicts of interest between tower and defense 
contractors for whom he worked 
the most pointed questioning during four days of hearings came 
from levin and sen albert gore jr dtenn who pressed tower on 
whether he saw the appearance of conflict of interest stemming from 
his transition from the senate to the us arms negotiating team to 
defense contractor to defense secretary 
tower provided documentary evidence that he had severed all 
financial ties with the contractors he said he gone beyond legal 
requirements to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
he also argued that his contributions to defense contractors were 
at once valuable and intangible 
i gave them sort of academic advice on what could happen he 
testified any number of think tanks in town could have given them 
more detailed analysis 
being available at the end of a telephone is of value to 
people he said his advice he said did not involve classified 
matter and was all enlightened guesswork 
yes but it was enlightened retorted an exasperated levin 
insisting that we have to assume that this is a troubling 
appearance

botha plans to stay on as head of state for the time being 
despite his recent stroke but de klerk will play a role in 
policymaking 
a former attorney de klerk 52 is considered slightly more 
conservative than his main rivals for the party leadership post but 
he does not describe himself in such terms

part of an attempt to push me in a direction i do not want to go 
de klerk comes from a long line of politicians his 
greatgrandfather was a senator and his father jan de klerk was 
cabinet minister from 1955 to 1968 de klerks brother willem 
formerly was editor of rapport a nationally circulated

of the conservatives who won 23 parliamentary seats in transvaal in 
1987

a man who volunteered to coach his 
daughters grade school basketball team and was then dismissed 
because he has aids was reinstated thursday while school officials 
review his case 
allen ward 37 was dismissed last week after only one game as 
coach of the intramural team at laurel elementary school 
administrators cited a new aids policy that requires school 
employees suspected of carrying the aids virus to be tested and 
their cases reviewed by a committee of health and school officials 
don jobe superintendent of franklin county community schools 
said at a news conference thursday that ward would be allowed to 
continue coaching after all at least until the school board decides 
whether his condition constitutes a public health threat he said he 
hoped a decision could be made in about two weeks 
he said he believed wards condition is not such as to 
consitute an immediate health threat 
ward who had launched a petition drive to be reinstated said he 
was happy to be going back to work 
i really feel good about it ward said i believe their 
decision will come out in my favor 
ward contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from tainted 
blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984 he was 
diagnosed as having aids last june

had criticized the decision to suspend him as did the parents of 
some of his players 
dora cable of metamora whose 10yearold son is on wards coed

stupidity into our children will make it go away 
its been blown out of proportion added another team parent 
pam gerrain i dont see anything wrong with him coaching the 
team im not worried about it but theres always a chance i 
guess 
ward had vounteered to coach the team of fourth fifth and 
sixthgraders when his daughter decided to play at the school 60 
miles southeast of indianapolis he and his wife theresa also have 
a 14yearold son at the school

and was unsure why it wasnt until last week that they tried to 
dismiss him

pakistani officials on thursday denied claims 
by a us congressman that their nation was willing to agree to 
international inspection of all nuclear facilties there if the 
united states would sell it power reactors 
javad akhtar a spokesman at the pakistani embassy said his 
government was sticking to its longstanding position that it was 
willing to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty only if india 
did likewise 
india exploded what it called a peaceful nuclear device in 
1972 and us officials have said they believe that pakistan may 
also be developing a bomb 
rep stephen solarz dny had said tuesday that top pakistani 
officials told him on a recent visit to islamabad that if the 
united states is willing to sell nuclear reactors for peaceful 
nuclear energy pakistan would agree to establish fullscale 
safeguards on all their nuclear facilities including existing 
ones 
in response the embassy distributed a statement saying that one 
reactor at karachi was already subject to inspection by the 
international atomic energy agency in vienna but that international 
inspection of the entire program awaited what it called a regional 
solution 
neither akhtar nor the statement mentioned india by name but the 
allusion was clear 
the statement said that pakistan was not prepared to accept any 
discriminatory measures treatment in this regard 
the cause of nonproliferation in this region could only be 
promoted through nondiscriminatory and equitable measures it was 
in this context that pakistan proposed a regional approach to the 
nuclear issue and had made a number of proposals in this regard 
akhtar said reading the statement 
the statement reiterated the peaceful nature of pakistans 
nuclear program

a state trooper who notched more drunken 
driving arrests in travis county in 1988 than any other lawman lied 
on reports and under oath and more than 150 cases will be tossed 
out authorities said 
the 31yearold trooper on the force eight years was suspended 
with pay wednesday after an internal investigation said david 
wells spokesman for the texas department of public safety 
he said the department would ask that none of the troopers cases 
be prosecuted 
that basically means that neither the department of public 
safety nor my office can vouch for his credibility and veracity and 
for that reason we will not prosecute any cases based solely on 
the troopers testimony said ken oden travis county attorney 
oden said 150 to 200 pending cases for driving while intoxicated 
will have to be dropped 
the trooper had made 250 arrests for drunken driving through 
november according to reports published in december when the probe 
began during the investigation the trooper was transfered to the 
warrants division 
steve mccleery first assistant district attorney said his 
offices investigation was progressing and that the dps probe would 
be studied 
the credibility of the trooper first was questioned in 1987 by 
defense lawyers who said his reports in drunken driving cases 
contained too many similarities to be believed

a report questioning the effectiveness of navy 
systems to defend against lowflying missiles has prompted a house 
subcommittee to schedule hearings on the program a congressional 
aide said thursday 
rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the house armed 
services subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical 
materials ordered hearings to be held in march said ralph 
degennaro an aide to the congressman 
declassified portions of the report prepared by the general 
accounting office an arm of congress said that may 1984 tests of 
the phalanx antimissile system were done without interference from 
other weapons radars and active shipboard electronic 
countermeasures that might exist in combat situations 
reps barbara boxer dcalif and george hochbrueckner dny 
requested the report after the may 17 1987 incident in the persian 
gulf in which the uss stark was hit by two exocet missiles fired by 
an iraqi mirage aircraft thirtyseven americans died in the attack 
the stark was equipped with a phalanx antimissile system a 
computercontrolled system that shoots down missiles at close range 
i am concerned that not enough attention was paid to the 
effectiveness of the radars and fire control systems aboard the 
stark boxer said these systems are supposed to warn the crew 
of airborne threats such as the deadly exocet missiles which hit 
the stark and allow the crew sufficient time to respond 
while the official navy report and report of the house armed 
services committee absolved the equipment of any blame mr 
hochbrueckner and i believe those reports raise questions about the 
effectiveness of the ships system she said 
a navy spokesman lt bruce cole responded to the gao report 
saying we have confidence in the capability of the ffg7 to 
defend itself but it is generally accepted that the ffg7 is not as 
robust as some of the other combatants 
the stark is an ffg7 or oliver hazard perry class guided 
missile frigate 
in a letter commenting on the gao report robert c duncan 
director of defense research and engineering at the pentagon said 
the frigates have an adequate capability to defeat seaskimming 
missiles but only if all defensive systems are operational and the 
crew is welltrained

mild electrical shocks and ammonia vapors 
could be used in efforts to reshape the thinking of some sex 
offenders under two measures approved thursday by the state house 
the house voted 960 for a joint resolution calling for the 
department of corrections to institute a program aimed at curing 
convicted sex offenders of deviant urges 
the house then voted unanimously for a bill requiring the program 
to be installed at the joseph harp correctional center both 
measures now go to the senate 
the program still being formulated by the corrections 
department could use aversion therapy group counseling or other 
components said spokesman jerry massie 
massie said corrections officials hope to have the program in 
place in the next six months 
he said legislative approval is not required but corrections 
officials hope the legislature will appropriate funds for the 
program no funding was included in the measures passed thursday 
rep jeff hamilton author of the joint resolution said the 
recidivism rate for sex offenders is about 80 percent where no 
treatment program is offered but it drops to from 5 percent to 33 
percent after participation in a program 
in one study it was shown that 53 offenders committed over 
25000 offenses consequently if there is even a 50 percent cure 
you reduce victimization by some 12000 he said 
participation in the program would be voluntary and hamilton 
estimated it could be implemented at a cost of 500000 or less 
eleven states now have treatment programs for sex offenders and 
massie said corrections officials have reviewed nine or 10 of them 
an oregon program uses aversion therapy including mild electric 
shocks and ammonia fumes to correct inmates when they fall into 
deviant ways of thinking 
these are proven methods of treatment that have been around a 
lot longer than most people realize said robert freemanlongo 
the developer of oregons program and a consultant to the oklahoma 
corrections department 
its not clockwork orange treatment he said referring to 
a movie in which aversion therapy was used to reshape a violent 
inmates thinking 
but massie said too much emphasis has been placed on the aversion 
therapy aspect of the program thats just one component he 
said

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
thursday he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil import 
fee in the event congress cannot meet its deficitreduction targets 
through spending cuts alone 
greenspan told the taxwriting house ways and means committee he 
would most prefer that congress cut spending to meet the fiscal 1990 
deficit target of 100 billion 
pressed however on how to acheive that goal after weighing 
defense considerations and domestic priorities that rule out 
spending cuts greenspan said higher gasoline taxes would be the 
least disruptive tax to the economy and would have certain 
advantages to the nations longterm energy posture 
all taxes do harm over the long run expenditures tend to 
creep up and absorb any increases in them greenspan said but 
with certain limitations some do less harm than others 
rep dan rostenkowski dill the committees chairman has long 
supported an increase in the federal tax of 9 cents a gallon on 
gasoline as a way of helping balance the budget 
greenspan had endorsed an increase in gasoline taxes more than a 
year ago but his qualified support thursday was the first since 
president bush has taken office 
the fed chairman said higher gasoline taxes would be preferable 
to oil import fees because any gas tax increase would come at the 
tail end of the business process and therefore would not 
reverberate through the economy 
its only in that sense that i feel that it is the lesser 
evil he said allowing deficits to persist courts a 
dangerous corrosion of our economy and risks potentially significant 
reductions over time in our standard of living 
with each penny per gallon yielding a 1 billion in revenues 
gradual increases of five cents a year in the gas tax levy are 
becoming more attractive to many lawmakers as a way of reducing the 
federal deficit 
but they are widely opposed in the south and west where people 
drive more than in the rest of the country and would have to bear 
much of any increase 
the government ended the 1988 fiscal year with a budget deficit 
of 1551 billion 111 billion over the 144 billion target for 
that year established by the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
with no new taxes or spending the white house budget office 
projects the 1990 deficit will fall to 127 billion even assuming a 
35 percent rate of growth and a decline in interest rates 
the congressional budget office assuming a slower growth rate 
and higher interest rates predicts the the 1990 deficit would be a 
146 billion without new taxes or spending cuts

the communist party opened an ideology 
conference thursday aimed at charting a new course following a 
central committee offer to allow the opposition to organize and 
participate in running the country 
gen wojciech jaruzelski the leader of the nation and the party 
delivered the opening address to 469 party members and hundreds of 
observers from other east bloc countries gathered in warsaw 
poland is living through a time of great transformations they 
are being born among various contradictions in the course of 
discussions and disputes in the increasingly broad socialist 
dialogue jaruzelski said 
hence our expectation the conference will answer questions 
about the current shape of values and principles of socialism their 
presence in political and economic transformations the essence of 
pluralism and directions of further chances in the party itself 
he said 
issues of ownership the political system itself and changes in 
the party are among the main topics at the meeting said andrzej 
czyz head of the partys ideological department in an interview 
with the news agency pap 
the party convened the conference at a time when there is open 
criticism among its members over a central committee offer made at a 
party plenum jan 18 to negotiate the legalization of the banned 
trade union solidarity 
the partysanctioned martial law crackdown in december 1981 
crushed the soviet blocs only independent trade union and 
parliament formally banned the union about a year later 
at the plenum 20 percent of the central commitee members opposed 
trade union pluralism politburo member jozef czyrek told the weekly 
newspaper polityka 
the future of the union as well as political and economic reforms 
will be discussed when party officials government representatives 
and members of the opposition open talks feb 6 
agreement combined with opening to broadly perceived pluralism 
will not be easy and will also be a struggle jaruzelski said 
but we want this process to be marked by political culture mutual 
respect which overcomes confrontational stereotypes rancour and 
resentment 
politburo member marian orzechowski designated to prepare the 
ideological conference said monday the conference is merely 
concerned with ideology and theory it cannot take any personnel 
changes it cannot take any other binding conclusions 
orzechowski said that the party has more than 2 million members 
and that less than 100 members had handed in their party cards after 
the decision on soldiarity 
czyz said the polish party had been following changes in other 
socialist countries and that party scientists and theoreticians had 
met with their counterparts from the soviet union and hungary before 
the conference 
the closeddoor sessions of the conference will continue until 
saturday

the senate rules committee on thursday rebuffed 
federal judge alcee l hastings request that the full senate 
conduct evidence hearings in his impeachment trial 
instead the committee called for a panel of 12 lawmakers to 
conduct hearings that would be televised so senators could watch if 
they chose 
there will be no question about the fairness of it rules 
committee chairman wendell ford dky said as his panel approved 
90 a plan under which senate leaders would name six republican and 
six democratic lawmakers to hear evidence 
the 52yearold florida jurist is accused of plotting to get a 
150000 payoff 
under the committees plan which is expected to be approved by 
the senate the full senate would first hold hearings on hastings 
motions to dismiss the charges against him 
then the 12senator panel would convene to hear perhaps six weeks 
of evidence concerning hastings who is the first black official 
ever to be impeached he is also the first black us district judge 
in florida 
the house approved 4133 on aug 8 a bill of impeachment alleging 
that the us district court judge conspired with a washington 
attorney to obtain money from two convicted racketeers in exchange 
for a guarantee they would not serve time 
it also accuses him of making false statements at the 1983 trial 
in which a federal jury acquitted him of conspiracy in that case 
the bill of impeachment also accuses hastings of disclosing 
information obtained by the government from a wiretap it says his 
action wrecked a federal criminal investigation 
impeached by the house hastings now faces the second step in the 
process trial by the senate if convicted by the full senate he 
will be removed from his 89500 post on the bench house members 
act as prosecutors and there is no appeal from the senates 
decision 
hastings who was not on hand for the rules committee session 
says he is innocent he wasnt in his chambers thursday in miami and 
couldnt be reached immediately for comment on the ruling 
he has been saying that all of the senators who will vote on the 
charges should hear the evidence in person and see the demeanor of 
the witnesses not merely read a committee transcript 
lawmakers however have been wary about tying up the senate 
floor for six weeks or more shunting such sessions into a committee 
is a procedure devised in the 1930s after a painfully long 
impeachment trial 
we have other constitutional responsibilities ford said 
the procedure was not used until 1986 when impeached district 
judge harry e claiborne of las vegas sought in vain to hang onto 
his black robe even though he already was serving a prison sentence 
for tax evasion 
in the current case the rules committee left it up to the 
special 12member panel to decide if the television signals from the 
evidence hearings would be sent by closed circuit only to senators 
offices or made available to the public the claiborne trial was 
broadcast nationwide by the cablesatellite public affairs network 
cspan 
the evidence hearings also will be videotaped for viewing by 
senators in their offices 
the video will give us an opportunity to accommodate judge 
hastings in his request that we watch the demeanor of the 
witnesses ford said 
before the evidence phase of the trial gets under way perhaps in 
march the senate must first act on motions by hastings and his 
attorney terence j anderson to dismiss the counts against him 
ford said he thought such matters could be cleared up within 30 
days 
anderson a university of miami law professor said he thought 
the scheduling of motions was sensible and represents some 
recognition of the seriousness of the issues 
anderson repeated his argument that leaving the case to a panel 
was unconstitutional although he said it could prove beneficial to 
hastings 
the argument is at least youll have the full attention of 12 
senators instead of people wandering in and out but im not sure 
thats constitutional he said judge hastings is not fighting 
just to keep a job hes fought to vindicate constitutional 
principle

a bipartisan group of senators is asking 
transportation secretary samuel skinner to allow imposition of 
tougher milespergallon standards for 1990 cars 
a department spokesman hal paris said today that no decision 
would be made on the standards until skinner reviews the matter 
paris said he doubts that the new secretary has yet seen the 
senators letter which was sent wednesday 
the letter asked skinner to allow the corporate average fuel 
efficiency standard to go to 275 miles per gallon for the 1990 
model year that would mean an automobile manufacturer would have to 
meet that standard as an average for all cars produced 
the current standard is 265 miles per gallon allowed by former 
transportation secretary jim burnley although a fuel conservation 
law calls for it to be one point higher the law allows the 
transportation secretary to relax the standard year by year and 
skinner would have to take such action for the standard not to 
increase for 1990 models 
the automotive industry says government imposition of mileage 
standards forces it to produce smaller cars that the buying public 
doesnt want a bill was introduced wednesday to abolish the 
standards 
the senators led by sen john h chafee rri who is ranking 
republican on the committee on environment and public works praised 
skinner for showing a refreshing sensitivity to environmental 
concerns when he appeared before the committee last week 
others signing the letter were sens brock adams dwash david 
durenberger rminn albert gore jr dtenn bob graham dfla 
and john kerry dmass 
the senators said burnleys action allowing a lower standard was 
taken at the same time that evidence was mounting and suggesting 
that if anything to help control the problem of global climate 
change that results from the emission of greenhouse gases such as 
carbon dioxide from motor vehicles we should be tightening the 
standards not relaxing them 
it urged skinner to reject all petitions to relax the standards 
and asked that he consult with senators opposed to the lower 
standard before announcing his decision 
rep bob carr dmich said the rules cause the economy to 
suffer in his home state and the nation 
he introduced again a bill which died last session without action 
by the house energy and commerce committee whose chairman rep 
john dingell dmich said the fueleconomy standards appeared to 
be working fairly well 
carr in introducing the measure said cafe is a government 
regulation that is simply not needed 
he said with the rules the two largest domestic automakers 
general motors and ford face the unfortunate prospect of having 
to limit or stop selling some of the most popular cars in america

indian soldiers opened fire thursday on 
student demonstrators at a university in a northern town killing at 
least two people and injuring eight police said 
a police official said on condition of anonymity that the 
students in jaffna were protesting the killing of another student by 
indian troops on wednesday 
the students were mostly ethnic tamils india has about 47000 
troops in northern sri lanka to put down an insurrection by tamil 
militants who have been fighting for an independent homeland since 
1983 
an official at the indian high commission or embassy in colombo 
said there were no reports of such shooting thursday 
however the official said indian soldiers killed five tamil 
rebels in two areas in the north 
meanwhile militants from the majority sinhalese community killed 
at least eight supporters of the governing united national party in 
the southern town of matara police said 
they said the victims were killed in separate attacks wednesday 
another governing party supporter was killed in the town of 
wattegama east of colombo they said 
sinhalese militants have killed at least 1000 people in an 
antigovernment campaign launched in july 1987 they say the 
government sold out the sinhalese community by signing an accord to 
end the tamil rebellion 
india sponsored the july 29 1987 accord because of the 
sympathies of its own 60 million tamils to the rebel cause but new 
delhi moved in soldiers to quell the insurgency after the largest 
tamil rebel group reneged on the peace plan 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people they say 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population 
in other violence reported thursday police said the bodies of 
three suspected sinhalese extremists were found and a supporter of 
the opposition sri lanka freedom party was killed in other towns in 
the south 
police said the killings of political party supporters appeared 
to be aimed at disrupting general elections set for feb 15 
sinhalese extremists oppose holding the elections 
meanwhile a littleknown group called the green tigers believed 
to be progovernment has been killing suspected sinhalese 
extremists over the past two months

israeli officials on thursday 
sharply played down prime minister yitzhak shamirs offer to 
withdraw troops from some palestinian cities following strong 
opposition from jewish settlers 
palestinians also have rejected shamirs plan saying it is a 
ploy to cheat them out of statehood 
in the west bank a palestinian was killed in a clash with 
troops bringing the palestinian death toll in the uprising to 371 
foreign minister moshe arens said shamir was simply quoting the 
1978 camp david accords wednesday when he made the withdrawal offer 
arens and shamir spokesman avi pazner denied it was part of a new 
peace initiative 
shamir said troops could be withdrawn from some palestinian 
cities and deployed elsewhere if palestinians accepted autonomy as 
an interim solution to the arabisraeli conflict he noted troop 
redeployment also was called for in the camp david accords 
if this withdrawal proposal is accepted terrible things will 
happen rabbi moshe levinger a militant founder of the jewish 
settlement movement told arens who was touring hebron and west 
bank settlements 
there will be riots and demonstrations by tens of thousands of 
palestinians they will go out from the cities and conduct 
pogroms said levinger who is under investigation in the slaying 
of a hebron shopkeeper during a stonethrowing incident 
rabbi moshe bleicher agreed it would be a mistake to withdraw 
troops 
each concession will cause greater difficulties if we pull 
back from the first line we have to fight on the second line he 
told arens 
arens visibly embarrassed by levingers outburst tried to 
deemphasize the importance of shamirs remarks 
mr shamir has on a number of occasions and most recently 
yesterday quoted from the camp david accords and these are 
accords to which israel egypt and the united states are 
committed arens told reporters at beit hadassah a settler 
enclave in downtown hebron 
palestinians oppose autonomy as a ploy to cheat them out of 
statehood and have rejected both the camp david accords and shamirs 
offer 
israels former foreign minister abba eban told the associated 
press the withdrawal wouldnt work because it is a unilateral move 
a peace proposal requires reactions on the other side but 
here we can decide for ourselves just to get up in the morning and 
do it said eban who was in the netherlands addressing a 
conference on the arabisraeli conflict 
arens said shamirs comments were not part of an israeli peace 
initiative 
when the israeli government will come forth with a diplomatic 
initiative i think it will be quite clear and unambiguous said 
arens a member of shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
pazner said a peace initiative would contain new ideas based on 
camp david and would be presented when shamir visits washington 
this spring 
arens assured settlers they had his full support but he also 
urged them to improve ties with their arab neighbors 
a life sidebyside with the arabs this is one of our goals 
he said its up to you to develop these ties 
more than 70000 jewish settlers live among the 17 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
settlers complained to arens about frequent stonethrowing 
attacks by palestinians but vowed the violence would not make them 
leave the area 
legislator hanan porath of the national religious party urged the 
government to rehabilitate palestinian refugee camps starting with 
dheishe 
dheishe is surrounded by a nearly 9foothigh fence to stop 
residents from throwing stones at cars at the adjacent highway 
the refugees are living like monkeys behind that fence and 
there is an obligation to rehabilitate them porath said arens 
did not respond to the call 
in the west bank village of fahme a palestinian was shot and 
killed in a clash with troops the army said arab hospital 
officials identified the victim as ahmed jamil saabneh 22 of the 
nearby village of kfar rai 
three palestinians were wounded in clashes with troops arab 
hospital officials said the army said it was checking the report 
also thursday residents of the west bank settlement of bracha 
clashed with shepherds from the neighboring arab village of burin 
said officials at ittihad hospital in nearby nablus 
three burin residents including a 12yearold boy were 
hospitalized with beating injuries the officials said the 
shepherds dog was killed in the fighting 
the army said it was checking the report 
also thursday nine leftwing members of parliament sent a letter 
to the justice ministry demanding that courts in arab east jerusalem 
stop ordering the detention of palestinian youth below the age of 16 
we informed the ministry about cases from the last two weeks 
and told them that we are afraid that the norms of the west bank are 
coming into israel said dedi zucker a legislator from the 
leftwing citizens rights movement zucker said it was common 
practice in the occupied lands to detain youth before trial 
the justice ministry spokesman denied that courts in east 
jerusalem detain minors who under israeli law are youth below the 
age of 14 
we recieved the letter and investigated and we did not find any 
arab under the age of 14 who had been arrested said spokeswoman 
etti eshed according to the law no one under the age of 14 can be 
arrested we are going to ask the members of knesset parliament to 
present specific cases

a politburo member who veered from the

of the policymaking central committee 10 days ahead of schedule to 
discuss imre pozsgays comments 
pozsgay a leading reformer said over the weekend the revolt 
which was quashed by soviet tanks was not a counterrevolution as 
the official view says but a popular uprising 
party leader karoly grosz and premier miklos nemeth publicly 
disagreed with pozsgay 
janos lukacs who sits on the 11member politburo was quoted as 
telling budapest party activists pozsgays statement was his 
personal view 
as a result of what happened in the last few days the 
politburo decided to seek the opinion of the central 
committee lukacs was quoted as saying by the four major staterun 
dailies he said the meeting would be held feb 10 10 days ahead of 
schedule 
another politburo member matyas szueros said the official term 
of counterrevolution for the uprising was a simplification but 
the contrary view is another oversimplification hungarian radio 
reported 
it quoted szueros as saying there was need for analysis of the 
1956 events 
pozsgay said his opinion was based on a report by a committee he 
heads that is reviewing hungarys recent history 
the daily magyar nemzet said a fourhour discussion followed 
lukacss speech with party members demanding a look at the 100page 
report on which pozsgay said he based his assessment 
a western diplomat said he had heard the report would be 
published in a party monthly in march 
the dispute and a controversial suggestion by chief communist 
ideologist janos berecz that the party might not be able to lead 
hungary out of its economic and social woes have prompted 
speculation about possible changes in the ruling elite 
another western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
said lukacs statement indicated pozsgay might lose his seat on the 
ruling politburo gained at a party conference in may that swept 
reformers into top posts 
that conference also replaced 38 people on the 108member central 
committee but it remains dominated by more conservative party 
members who won their seats under former party leader janos kadar 
but pozsgays popularity outside the party in particular with 
many of hungarys independent groups would make it dangerous for 
the central committee to oust him 
lukacs said the central committee session also should set a 
suitable date for the next party congress now due in 1990

us experts with 52 tons of cleanup gear 
were bound for antarctica on thursday to tackle a fuel oil spill 
that officials said threatened baby penguins about to take their 
first swim 
a giant us air force c5 galaxy cargo plane carrying the gear 
and experts landed in punta arenas on the straits of magellan the 
official news agency orbe reported 
from there the mission was to board the polar duke a us 
research ship bound for the spill about 590 miles south of the cape 
horn 
anton l inderbitzen head of antarctic staff for the 
washingtonbased national science foundation said the polar duke 
was to depart friday and take about four days to reach the spill 
just off the antarctic peninsula and about two miles from the us 
scientific base palmer station 
our concern right now is primarily for the birds he told 
reporters at santiagos airport all the young penguins are just 
about at the age where they take their first swim 
when these birds enter the water for the first time it could 
be the last time 
there were conflicting reports of the extent of the spill which 
occurred when an argentine research and supply boat hit a rock 
saturday and listed before sinking tuesday 
the 9300ton vessel the paradise bay was carrying 250000 
gallons of diesel fuel according to the science foundation 
the boat was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate and 
hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped 
from its decks the foundation said 
a spokesman for the argentine ministry of defense said thursday 
there really wasnt a significant spill 
a short communique issued by the argentine navy said its planes 
will fly over the sunken vessel to make a visual evaulation of the 
damage and take photographs that allow us to decide the best means 
to employ to combat the effects that could be presented 
also an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene friday to assess 
the best ways available to combat the pollution the communique 
said 
some environmental experts and scientific groups have said 
hundreds of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the ship and created a 
slick up to 16 miles long but the chilean navy said the reports 
appeared exaggerated 
the information that we have is that there is no big spill 
said navy spokesman lt juan pablo barros 
jack renirie a science foundation spokesman said however that 
a slick did exist and that personnel at palmer station were 
gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around 
the grounded ship 
the latest we have now is that theres probably 150 to 200 
barrels in the water that slipped from the vessels deck renirie 
said in a telephone interview from santiago and theres still oil 
coming out of the ship 
inderbitzen said the science foundation which organized the 
cleanup mission and directs all us activities in antarctica 
feared lasting environmental damage 
some dead penguins had already been sighted and the slick had 
caused isolated schools of krill a shrimplike animal to surface 
renirie said 
inderbitzen said antarcticas delicate unspoiled environment 
requires special measures to contain the spill which is near two 
areas set aside for special scientific study under terms of the 
antarctic treaty 
in warm weather its easier for plants and even animals to 
recover from an accident he said but in antarctica it takes 
plants and animals many many years to recover because of the cold 
its a very very fragile environment 
the us cargo plane which is twice the size of a boeing 747 
carries a 35foot skimming boat for scooping up spilled oil and 
pumping it into floating tanks and a small tugboat and inflatable 
booms to contain drifting oil 
the cleanup work will be peformed by marine pollution control 
co under contract to the us navy renirie said 
the chilean navy said it will provide logistical support and 
dispatch its own ship with scientists and equipment to assist in 
case any contamination exists

soviet television viewers could soon be exposed to 
regular doses of something all too familiar to westerners 
commercials 
the prospect arose at a news conference thursday to announce that 
the worlds biggest advertising agency saatchi and saatchi has 
been hired to advise the soviets on how to attract western 
advertisers and their hard currency 
the idea is to build up corporate images and familiarize soviets 
with the types of products they can expect from president mikhail s 
gorbachevs consumeroriented reforms 
since our audience is not used to commercials at all its a 
sort of entertainment for them said jane tarassova head of legal 
services at gostelradio the government broadcasting agency 
gostelradio has hired the londonbased saatchi and saatchi as its 
exclusive worldwide consultant 
the purpose of the consultancy is to help them generate revenue 
from advertising said michael parker deputy managing director of 
saatchi 
well be saying to them these are the advertising agencies 
around the world that you will need to talk to these are the big 
advertisers around the world who are likely to be spending money on 
soviet television 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness soviet 
television has experimented with commercials for western products 
images of michael jackson dancing to rock music in a pepsi 
commercial flickered across soviet screens last year and british 
airways the dhl courier service omega watches and benetton 
clothing also have advertised there 
ms tarassova said to soviet viewers the western tv ad is 
beautifully done its interesting in some sort of way it presents 
a piece of foreign music 
parker said the consultancy agreement is openended he refused 
to say how much the soviets are paying for it but said gostelradio 
could expect to take in millions of dollars in ad revenues within 
the next five years 
he admitted that enticing western companies to advertise in a 
country where their products arent available will be difficult 
in the short term he said you will tend to see the sorts 
of advertisements which are corporate in nature they are simply 
establishing the name and reputation of the company against that 
time when theyll be in a position to be actively selling 
soviet tv broadcasts on two main channels with regional channels 
in all the republics the estimated audience is 180 million with 
another 30 million viewers in east bloc countries 
reaching that audience parker said will cost western 
advertisers 17500 to 35000 per 30second commercial a 
comparable nationwide tv commercial in britain a country of 56 
million people averages 52500 
ms tarassova predicted western commercials would have soviet 
viewers glued to their sets 
i think for the mass audience its a kind of new and 
interesting thing to watch she added we would like to make our 
television more sophisticated more interesting to the audience not 
so very stiff and official

every model of new twodoor cars that was 
intentionally run into posts and barriers at 5 mph suffered at least 
several hundred dollars damage with the worst repair estimate 
totaling 3444 according to insurance industry tests released 
thursday 
although some cars performed better than in similar tests a year 
ago there is no reason why any car should be damaged at all 
said brian oneill spokesman for the insurance institute for 
highway safety 
oneill said the lowspeed tests were conducted over the past 
month at test facilities in hartwood va using 19 new 1989 cars 
purchased anonymously by the institute which is financed by the 
insurance industry damage estimates were updated for 15 other cars 
where the model had not changed since identical 1988 tests 
repair estimates after four tests were over 3000 for three 
cars the isuzu impulse at 3444 the daihatsu charade at 3047 
and the honda crx hf at 3040 the leastdamaged cars were the geo 
spectrum with 434 damage the toyota corolla with 495 and the 
plymouth colt with 642 
each of 34 cars tested was run into a barrier both frontward and 
backward and also frontward into an angle barrier and backward into 
a pole all at 5 mph the mostcostly damage in most cases was in 
the pole test where the impact was concentrated over a smaller area 
the pole did 1445 damage to the isuzu model 
prior to the 1983 model year federal law required that cars 
sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests for newer 
models the standard was lowered to 25 mph 
less than a third of the cars in the new tests sustained no 
damage at all in the front and rear barrier tests 
in 1981 tests oneill said the ford escort suffered no damage 
in all four tests 
in the new tests a 1989 ford escort lx had no damage in the 
front and rear barrier tests but the institute estimated repairs 
costing 1481 to the 1989 model after the pole and angle crashes 
ford motor co spokeswoman joyce stinson said the difference is 
due to changes in the model that include a lightweight bumper to 
help ford meet federally imposed mileage standards 
she said the pole and angle tests are very tough but all of 
fords cars voluntarily comply with the pre1983 standard for 
straighton barrier crashes rather than the lessstringent 25 mph 
standard 
a spokesman for isuzu dan mccue said he could not comment on 
the results because he had not seen the documentation from the tests 
but he noted that another isuzuproduced car the geo spectrum 
suffered the leastcostly damage in the tests 
kurt antonius spokesman for american honda in los angeles said 
the crx hf model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper 
but other honda models have stronger bumpers than last year 
the most important thing is that this is not related to auto 
safety he said the tests did not cover any injuries that might 
occur to driver or passengers in lowspeed crashes 
the institute said a basic honda crx model which was the worst 
affected in 1988 with 2782 damage sustained 2061 in damage to 
the 1989 model 
this improvement is encouraging said oneill but there 
was still a lot of damage to the 89 honda crx and a very long way 
to go 
the fourth mostdamaged car a chrysler conquest tsi with a 
repair estimate totaling 2357 required a new front fender at a 
cost of 300 
oneill said the massproduced sheetmetal fender costs as much 
as a washing machine which comes complete with motor pump hoses 
and circuitry as well as the metal housing 
he said a similar fender for a 1989 sundance also a chrysler 
product costs 92 
bill dunn a chrysler corp spokesman said he had not seen the 
data from the institute and could not comment on the results without 
knowing more about criteria used for the tests and damage estimates 
oneill said independent appraisers were used to assess damages 
in the case of the honda crx hf and 14 other cars the estimates are 
based on 1989 repairs of cars damaged in 1988 tests because there 
was no change in the models he said 
none of the cars was repaired by the institute but all were sold 
as damaged vehicles to ensure that they would not be passed along as 
new after repairs oneill said

with proper precautions pregnant women can travel 
to most places and undertake most activities they enjoyed before 
short of extreme pursuits such as water skiing or highaltitude 
climbing doctors say 
theres a real feeling out there that women should try to be as 
active as they can during pregnancy said dr frank bia 
coauthor of newly compiled medical guidelines for pregnant women 
who travel 
pregnant travelers are no longer just businesswomen stepping onto 
domestic airplanes but increasingly are adventure travelers or 
career women sent to third world countries by government or 
humanitarian agencies said bia codirector of yale universitys 
tropical medicine and international travelers clinic in new haven 
conn 
there are so many volunteer agencies where youre committed to 
a year or two and people are starting their families in the middle 
of central africa he said in a telephone interview wednesday 
the guidelines devised by bia and the clinics codirector dr 
michele barry are published in fridays journal of the american 
medical association 
they cover five major areas commercial flying exercise and 
trekking at high altitudes travelers diarrhea immunizations and 
malaria 
its quite complete and up to date it is a good review said 
dr henry klapholz an assistant professor of obstetrics and 
gynecology at harvard medical school in boston 
klapholz said he believes most us women now travel at some time 
during their pregnancies 
those going abroad should remember that comparable levels of 
medical care are often unavailable outside western nations he said 
thursday prematurity surgery blood transfusion and other medical 
problems and procedures that are easily handled here often carry 
graver risks elsewhere klapholz said 
us airlines now permit pregnant women to fly up until their 
36th week of gestation about four weeks short of term while 
foreign airlines usually make the cutoff 35 weeks bia and ms barry 
wrote 
most aspects of flying are entirely safe for normal pregnant 
women and their fetuses including airport metal detectors in 
airports they said 
the same is not true for strenuous vacations at high altitudes 
the doctors wrote 
while rigorous exercise need not be curtailed during pregnancy 
treks above 7000 feet should probably be avoided they wrote they 
also recommended against water skiing or scuba diving below 60 feet 
because of the possibility of injury to the fetus 
klapholz added snow skiing to the list noting it is a sport 
requiring a high degree of balance which is thrown off by the 
physical changes pregnancy brings 
on the topic of travelers diarrhea the guidelines said pregnant 
women must be fastidious about avoiding contaminated food and 
water but should not use iodides for longterm water purification 
because of the possibility they could cause an enlarged thyroid 
gland in the fetus 
additionally women should avoid the popular diarrhea remedy 
subsalicylate bismuth sold under the peptobismol brand name bia 
said its salicylate component could cause fetal bleeding and 
bismuth a heavy metal has been linked to fetal malformations in 
sheep he said 
immunizations should be avoided during pregnancy if possible if 
deemed necessary immunizations should not use live vaccine or cause 
fever the guidelines said with a live vaccine virus can infect 
the fetus while fever has been associated with spontaneous 
abortions they said 
as for malaria for which no vaccine exists the best strategy is 
to try to protect against mosquito bites that transmit the disease 
and to take the preventive drug chloroquine which has proven safe 
for pregnant women the guidelines say

more than 1000 workers at the academy of sciences 
on thursday protested their leaderships failure to nominate human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov to a new national legislature 
resign resign the crowd chanted when one speaker read a 
banner that demanded the prestigious academys ruling presidum step 
down 
other protesters held handwritten banners reading down with 
academic democracy sakharov yes and who if not 
sakharov 
the academy workers ranging from prominent intellectuals to 
members of informal political groups massed outside the 
organizations headquarters in damp weather to hear a dozen speakers 
we have a fundamental crisis in the academy of sciences a 
crisis of mistrust of the wide masses in soviet science related to 
ecological problems the chernobyl catastrophe and many other 
circumstances declared lev mukhin a laboratory head at the 
academys space research institute 
sakharov listened to the speeches at the base of the steps 
applauding speakers but not taking the floor himself 
the academys presidium voted jan 18 on nominations for deputies 
to the new 2250seat congress of peoples deputies a parliamentary 
body that will be elected in march and will in turn choose a 
fulltime legislature and president the parliament will have 
representatives from professional political and social 
organizations as well as from localities 
the presidium rejected the nominations of sakharov 67 a nuclear 
physicist and dean of the soviet human rights movement space 
scientist roald sagdeyev and other prominent intellectuals 
mukhin speaking from the steps of the groups neoclassical 
headquarters said the rejections have eroded the prestige of the 
academy of sciences 
sakharov has been nominated to represent a moscow district but 
many of his scientific colleagues wanted him chosen to represent 
them in the academy 
sakharov complained wednesday in the weekly newspaper literary 
gazette that the nominating process in the academy of sciences was 
working well at the lower level 
but he said that when the leadership made its final picks only 
top administrators were picked he charged the leadership failed to 
fulfill its legal obligations and ignored the popular will in 
selecting its candidates 
similar complaints were voiced at thursdays demonstration 
one banner poked fun at the communist party newspaper pravda 
which on wednesday published an article saying the meeting at which 
sakharov was defeated was not only fully democratic but 
benevolent the name of the newspaper means truth and one banner 
declared pravda is halftruth 
the crowd heckled an academy vice president vladimir 
kudryavtsev who defended the selection of deputy nominees and 
promised that alternative views would be considered at a later stage 
in the election process 
tass the official soviet news agency quoted academy president 
guri marchuk as saying the protesters complaints will be considered 
at a meeting of the academys presidium on tuesday 
sakharov told reporters after the meeting it showed that 
opposition had a voice in president mikhail s gorbachevs program 
for perestroika or restructuring 
i consider this is an important event on the road to our 
perestroika said sakharov the scientific society has had its 
say i think it the meeting will play a great role in the history 
of soviet science 
the demonstrators approved resolutions criticizing the candidates 
put forward by the presidium asking them to withdraw from the 
elections and proposing creation of a new scientific group 
independent of the academy

a threeday meeting of the divided 
communist party leadership produced no plan for solving yugoslavias 
economic and political crisis despite warnings from the military 
that it might step in 
among the most serious problems are annual inflation approaching 
300 percent a 21 billion foreign debt unemployment of 17 percent 
and a living standard that has been cut in half since president tito 
died in 1980 
agreement was reached on only one issue at the party central 
committee meeting which ended wednesday night to convene a special 
party congress this year in an attempt to break the political 
deadlock 
twenty senior officials resigned their party posts or were 
replaced including a former party president and three members of 
the countrys ninemember collective presidency 
the main conflict is between factions who want more political 
pluralism and democracy and those who favor increased central party 
control 
we are divided on fundamental questions committee member 
josip vrhovec said during the meeting we have two different 
clearly ideologically defined parties 
an editorial in the daily slobodna dalmacija said the main 
feature of the session which initially promised a definite 
showdown but brought just several skirmishes was a huge number 
of endless descriptions of the already wellknown circumstances and 
causes of the crisis 
all yugoslavs find themselves with a contradictory feeling on 
the one hand we want a final solution to the crisis while on the 
other we fear such a solution would never occur without a drama 
the military which traditionally sits out political argument 
indicated with unusual bluntness it may take a hand if the 
leadership rift deepens 
what some describe as the battle for yugoslavia will not be 
waged without the yugoslav army said adm petar simic chief 
political officer of the armed forces 
he and vice adm stane brovet appealed for unity urgent 
marketoriented reforms and more tolerance and democracy 
stipe suvar the party chairman told the meeting a political 
climate should be created for the reforms necessary to overcome 
the difficult situation in the country and to enable the communist 
party to stop losing battle after battle 
party membership in the ethnically diverse federation of six 
republics has declined nearly 10 percent since 1981 to fewer than 2 
million of yugoslavias 24 million people 
slobodna dalmacija said no solution to the countrys problems is 
possible while each republic has its own independent communist party 
among those whose resignations from party posts were accepted 
were vidoje zarkovic former national party chief and the three 
members of the collective presidency lazar mojsov stane dolanc and 
sinan hasani 
mojsov dolanc and hasani continue as members of the presidency 
but a new policy does not allow an official to hold jobs in both the 
national government and party 
zarkovic a close associate of tito resigned in response to 
demands made during huge demonstrations last month in his home 
republic of montenegro that led to replacement of the montenegrin 
leadership

been fitzwater said we didnt do it right the first time 
thats all 
the press spokesman said he did not know if bush had had any 
fever during the week

algeria will get a 58 million loan to fight 
locusts that are threatening to destroy over 190 million acres of 
crops on land that has helped feed the mediterranean area for more 
than 2000 years the world bank announced thursday 
in ancient times north africa was the breadbasket of the roman 
empire 
now the swarms of locusts could destroy the livelihood of 12 
million people the loan will go to help a 112 million project for 
buying trucks and equipment and spraying 15 million acres over two 
years 
that is the expected duration of the locust plague that began in 
the sudan and mauretania in 1985 and has since swept across the 
sahara to the north 
the world bank which has 151 member countries is the biggest 
source of aid money to the third world it will make this loan for 
15 years including a five year grace period during that period 
only interest will be payable at a variable rate beginning at 765 
percent a year 
at the same time the us governments exportimport bank 
announced a 339 million loan to help increase production at oil

noise from minneapolisst paul international 
airport has not reduced the market value of three homes that sit 
beneath the flight path of one of the airports two busiest runways 
a jury ruled 
the homeowners had sued the metropolitan airports commission to 
recover about 10000 per home 
these people are just ordinary citizens who fought their best 
fight against an awesome industry an attorney for the plaintiffs 
richard gunn said after the hennepin county district court jurys 
decision wednesday 
the verdict frees the metropolitan airports commission from 
liability for the effect of airplane noise on the homes said tom 
anderson staff attorney for the commission 
jurors said they sympathized with the homeowners but to have 
issued a verdict in their favor the law required them to find that 
the homeowners property had been taken destroyed or damaged for 
public use without just compensation 
the homeowners frank and georgette ario helen wade and carl 
and gloria frost argued that noise from the airport has gradually 
increased eroding the value of their homes they live in an 
uppermiddle class area of older homes in the south part of the city 
frost said he wanted to win the case to make the airports 
commission more aware of homeowners rights and encourage moving the 
airport to a new location if they had to pay us it might set a 
precedent for other property owners in the area he said 
brad gunn another of the homeowners attorneys said they 
probably will ask for a new trial the verdict indicates that 
there is not a serious noise problem in that area of the city and 
the one thing that everyone from both sides agreed on is that there 
is a serious noise problem in that area he said 
as part of its defense the airports commission cited a 125000 
appraisal report that found no evidence that airplane noise had 
diminished the values of the three homes 
commission attorneys argued that demand for homes in the area 
remains strong and demand is what holds up prices he also noted 
that the area is tops in the city in terms of how quickly homes put 
on the market are sold

sen christopher dodd saying the american 
family has changed since the ozzie and harriet era reintroduced 
legislation thursday to require certain employers to provide unpaid 
leave to parents of newborn or seriously ill children 
the connecticut democrat was joined at a news conference by 
several of the house and senate allies who helped him push the 
legislation last year when it reached the senate floor only to 
expire in the face of an undeclared filibuster 
among them was sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the 
labor and human resources committee that is expected to turn to the 
dodd measure by midmarch after first dealing with a proposed 
increase in the minimum wage 
dodd noted that the bill has the backing of such diverse groups 
as the us catholic conference the american civil liberties union 
the american academy of pediatrics and the association of junior 
leagues 
like us they see the american family changing right before our 
eyes said dodd ozzie and harriet and june and ward cleaver 
have been replaced by roseanne and my two dads 
he said only one in 10 american families fit the ozzie and 
harriet or leave it to beaver role in which the father works 
and the mother stays at home moreover he said projections are 
that by 1995 twothirds of all preschool children will have mothers 
who work full time outside the home 
immediately after the news conference dodd convened the senate 
labor and human resources committees subcommittee on children 
family drugs and alcoholism which he heads for a hearing the 
only one planned on the bill this year to give proponents and 
opponents an opportunity to restate the positions they staked out 
during protracted proceedings last year 
dodd released a general accounting office study in conjunction 
with the hearing that said the measure which applies only to 
companies with 20 or more employees would cover about 12 percent of 
us businesses and 47 percent of the work force 
the gao an arm of congress estimated the bill would cost 
covered businesses 236 million a year all of it in the cost of 
continuing to provide health insurance for employees while they are 
on leave 
there would be no cost to the government 
the measure would require covered businesses to provide 10 weeks 
of unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child or for the 
serious illness of a child or elderly parent 
it also would require 13 weeks of unpaid leave for an employee 
unable to work because of his or her own serious illness

in the wake of a measles outbreak among young 
children in california federal health researchers said thursday 
that intensive efforts are needed to better vaccinate preschoolers 
if the disease is ever to be wiped out 
los angeles county last year reported 513 measles cases 18 
percent of the nations total of 2933 according to the national 
centers for disease control 
of the surveyed cases for which ages were known 26 percent or 
93 out of 353 were 16 months to 4 years old enough to be 
vaccinated but not old enough to fall under mandatory school 
immunization rules 
and of those 93 cases 86 percent were considered 
preventable meaning the children had not been vaccinated the 
remaining 14 percent were cases where children were vaccinated but 
got the measles anyway 
the routine age for vaccination is 15 months but in most 
states where vaccinations are required for school youve got that 
4year period where they are not required to have measles 
immunization said dr paul stehrgreen a cdc measles specialist 
that age group has been a focal point for recent measles 
outbreaks in los angeles miami and other places stehrgreen said 
thats why this report is focusing on that age group theyre 
not real easy to get at 
in the late 1970s cdc measles specialists believed the childhood 
disease could be eradicated in the united states by fall 1982 but 
that goal was not met in the past six years between 1497 and 
6282 cases have been reported each year 
part of the problem is what researchers call nonpreventable 
cases those patients who were vaccinated but still got measles 
since at best one in 20 vaccinations does not provide full 
immunity in the los angeles study 58 percent overall were 
considered nonpreventable the cdc said 
researchers disagree on whether widespread vaccination of all age 
groups can ever in theory provide the herd immunity needed to 
completely cut off the spread of measles among the susceptibles 
whose vaccines did not work measles is very efficient at picking 
off susceptibles stehrgreen said 
but as long as large numbers of preschoolers remain unvaccinated 
spreading the disease there is no way to talk about complete 
eradication he added 
in the los angeles outbreak the large percentage of 
vaccineeligible patients 16 months to 4 years of age who were 
unvaccinated demonstrates the need for intensive efforts to increase 
vaccine coverage in this hardtoreach group the atlantabased 
cdc concluded in its weekly report 
many of the los angeles cases occurred in hispanic children from 
lowereconomic areas where the quality and availability of medical 
care may not be as high the cdc said 
longterm outreach programs are needed for parents and children 
in low socioeconomic groups in urban areas the agency added 
the cdc recommended removal of obstacles to immunizations by 
extending clinic hours collaborations between health officials and 
community leaders to promote vaccination and consideration of 
community locations for use as temporary vaccination sites

agriculture secretarydesignate clayton yeutter 
said thursday at his confirmation hearing that as head of the 
chicago mercantile exchange he didnt know problems in futures 
trading were leading to an fbi investigation 
some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they 
are brought before a disciplinary committee yeutter told the 
senate agriculture committee most are fruitless some have 
validity and sanctions are applied upon those against whom charges 
are levied 
i was not aware this was a widespread problem he said 
he said he didnt know of the fbi sting operation nor was he 
ever approached by the agency while he was president of the exchange 
during a twoyear undercover fbi investigation which began in 
the last year of yeutters tenure and became public last month 
federal agents infiltrated the exchange to gather information about 
alleged fraud by brokers 
i know no more than what is in the newspapers yeutter said 
of the case 
yeutter was president of the exchange from 1978 to 1985 when he 
left to become us trade representative 
as he was leaving the trade representative job he was honored 
with a reception jan 18 given by the food tobacco and brewing 
conglomerate philip morris inc to thank him for his aggressive 
pursuit of foreign markets for tobacco and other products 
rules of the executive branch forbid officals from accepting 
anything of value from those who could be affected by the officials 
action as agriculture secretary yeutter would oversee the 
department whose policies directly affect philip morris 
the reception was reported thursday by the washington post and 
sen patrick leahy dvt questioned yeutter about a possible 
conflict of interest 
when philip morris suggested that they would like to hold some 
kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing 
in the international trade arena i could see no conflict of 
interest problems in them doing so because i was fully intending to 
go back to the private sector said yeutter 
when the event was agreed to it simply did not ring any 
conflict of interest bells he said noting that it was held near 
the end of reagans term you are not going to be causing any 
conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an administration 
he said presidentelect bush asked him to be agriculture 
secretary after he accepted philip morris invitation 
we probably should have reconsidered because of my expected 
continuation in government yeutter said frankly i just didnt 
think about it we were so busy wrapping up all the trade 
problems at ustr and getting ready for the transition into usda it 
totally disappeared from my attention screen 
leahy also asked yeutter whether receiving over 500000 in 
deferred payments from the chicago mercantile exchange while he was 
a government official could be construed as a conflict of interest 
yeutter said the payments were made under a traditional deferred 
compensation program and distributed to him in a form advised by his 
tax counsel 
despite the pointed questions yeutter was praised by members of 
the committee and is expected to be confirmed without difficulty 
the committee will meet early next week to vote on approval with 
confirmation by the full senate expected shortly thereafter 
as for his new job yeutter emphasized throughout the hearing 
what he said was the importance of holding down federal spending in 
agriculture and finding more foreign markets for american products 
we have to find ways to permit american farmers to earn income 
from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government he 
said 
we have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in 
this country 
other topics on which senators asked yeutters opinion and his 
responses were 
school lunches what will happen if the subsidy is withdrawn 
that is a policy i will have to take another look at 
farm credit if we do our jobs well and the farm economy does 
as well as it did this year in the future then the situation will 
not get out of hand 
general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt we are not 
about to abandon any import constraints in the united states unless 
there is quid pro quo in other countries giving us export 
opportunities its a horse trade 
rural development the push and initiative should come from 
local areas we can help coordinate and provide technical 
assistance he said the federal government does not have billions 
of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify 
subsidies we have to know what the tradeoffs are i never 
said we should do away with all subsidies only with trade 
limiting subsidies

selection of a jury pool for oliver l norths 
irancontra trial reached the halfway point thursday with the judge 
predicting the effort will take most of next week too he also 
declared heatedly he wont allow security gurus to interrupt the 
trial once it starts 
as a housekeeping matter chief trial prosecutor john keker 
told us district judge gerhard gesell he had been asked whether 
four courtroom seats could be made available on a rotating basis to 
the cia the justice defense and state departments and the national 
security agency 
gesell reacted angrily getting the seats would be no problem he 
said but he added 
im very concerned about their function i do not intend to 
have this case run by two or three security gurus sitting in the 
audience i dont want to be in a position where every time a 
document flashes by you go to these people who check with their 
department 
keker said he was only carrying a message and he added in 
some ways the best thing for the trial is to let them see what is 
happening he said i do not think it is their intention to 
interfere with the trial 
gesell said he would make the seats available but that he would 
work out ground rules for the agency representatives in private with 
the lawyers in the case 
by the end of the third day of selecting a pool of 50 potential 
jurors 18 women and 7 men had been qualified after painstaking 
often solicitous questioning by the judge and the lawyers in the 
celebrated case 
among those chosen for the final cut were a woman who said she 
only likes reading the horoscope and the comics a woman who heard 
something about shredding documents just before she turned off her 
tv set and an unemployed office manager who heard north was 
charged with selling something to iran but that didnt interest me 
very much 
one of those selected was a government heating mechanic working 
for the general services administration who had difficulty 
recognizing north in the courtroom 
im not sure if its that guy whos constantly blinking he 
is just constantly winking the prospective juror said when asked 
by prosecutor john keker whether he saw north in the courtroom 
north sitting across from the man on the other side of the room 
gave him a thumbsup sign 
i just dont want to be here said one woman who works as a 
staff assistant for the city government i had that experience 
before on jury duty and i just dont like it 
it turned out she was one of three people accepted in the morning 
session 
the others were a woman who worked for the navy for 21 years and 
a clerk typist at the labor department 
gesell north lawyer brendan sullivan and chief trial prosecutor 
john keker took turns at questioning prospective jurors who had said 
on a written questionnaire that they had not watched listened to or 
read accounts of the irancontra case 
repeatedly sullivan would ask whether just after the july 4 
weekend in 1987 they remembered seeing north testifying in his 
marine uniform before the joint congressional committees 
investigating the affair 
he testified for six days in uniform the tv was full of it 
sullivan told a government contract specialist she replied that she 
often watched a muted television set while listening to the radio 
judge and lawyers took pains to put the prospective jurors at 
ease commiserating with them about having to sit alone and answer 
personal questions individual questioning sometimes took a half 
hour 
throughout north sat at the defense table flanked by two of his 
three lawyers he appeared to pay rapt attention to the selection 
process now a civilian the former lieutenant colonel wore a dark 
blue suit and subdued tie 
prospective jurors have been instructed not to read watch or 
listen to anything about the case 
the former navy employee now a secretary said she didnt even 
turn the television on when she went home wednesday night 
because if i had i would have had to tell a lie i dont want to 
go to jail 
she recalled hearing norths name mentioned earlier on 
television but not seeing him her knowledge of the case came from 
her husband who thought north was somehow messing up she said 
she thought norths activities involved something about weapons 
selling weapons to the overseas people 
the court is looking for jurors who were largely unexposed to 
norths testimony which dominated the nations televison in 
mid1987 in his six days apperance the fired white house aide 
discussed many activities for which he now faces criminal charges 
north was granted immunity from being prosecuted on the basis of 
that testimony and his lawyers say their clients rights against 
selfincrimination would be jeopardized if jurors deliberations 
were colored by what they heard then the office of independent 
counsel lawrence walsh was required to gather information for the 
criminal charges independently 
north is accused of 12 crimes including lying to congress in 
1985 and 1986 about his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras 
and lying to the attorney general about the national security 
councils role in diverting money from the iran arms sales to the 
contras 
he also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the government of tax 
revenue by using a taxexempt foundation to funnel money to the 
contras

about 120 aeroflot passengers fed up with the 
shoddy service of the soviet unions only airline refused for hours 
to leave a plane that landed before reaching their destination a 
newspaper reported thursday 
the passengers of flight 357 from moscow to naberezhnye chelny 
waited overnight in a moscow airport last week for the weather o 
clear up so they could take off the labor newspaper trud said 
the plane finally took off at 807 am jan 24 but it landed 
before reaching naberezhnye chelny a town 500 miles east of moscow 
in the tatar republic the town formerly was called brezhnev after 
late soviet leader leonid i brezhnev 
the plane was held over again because of poor weather in kazan 
about three hours by car from naberezhnye chelny the passengers 
were asked to get out and wait for another plane but they refused 
trud said 
they demanded that aeroflot provide a bus to take them to their 
destination and that the airline refund part of the cost of their 
tickets the newspaper said 
after much persuasion airline officals were able to coax the 
women and children off the plane but 33 of the most stubborn 
passengers held out for five hours 
even the chairman of the republic did his best to get the 
passengers off but they did not agree to disembark until the 
airline gave in to their demands trud said 
aeroflot is the butt of jokes and ridicule in the soviet union 
for its poor service and delays but since it is the only carrier 
that makes domestic flights soviets have no choice 
on one recent flight six aeroflot passengers had to stand 
throughout the trip because the flight had been overbooked

negotiations between nato and warsaw pact 
nations on manpower cuts in central europe concluded on thursday 
after more than 15 years of inconclusive bickering 
spokesmen for both military blocs underscored the positive 
aspects of the talks which comprised the first multilateral arms 
reduction forum in postwar europe 
but negotiators even had trouble agreeing on a name for the 
marathon parley and the east rejected to the end the western name 
of mutual and balanced force reduction talks 
the sides halted their efforts after they agreed in a separate 
round of preparatory talks to begin the new negotiations on 
conventional armed forces in europe in vienna on march 6 
what the two sides did agree on was a joint dark blue tie with 
yellow symbols on a blue background symbolizing a sword being beaten 
into a plowshare 
the new talks unlike the nowconcluded conference that began in 
october 1973 will involve all 23 member countries of the two 
alliances and cover all of europe from the atlantic to the urals 
the direct participants in the talks now concluded were east and 
west germany belgium luxembourg the netherlands britain poland 
czechoslovakia the soviet union the united states and canada 
france did not take part 
the vienna negotiations failed because the two sides could not 
concur on mutual troop strengths and methods to police an eventual 
withdrawal 
the sides released a brief joint communique that said the 
extent of common ground has proved to be insufficient to enable the 
participants to agree on a treaty 
nevertheless the positions of the two sides have converged on 
a number of issues the participants have gained valuable experience 
and a clearer picture of what will be necessary to achieve mutually 
agreeable and verifiable reductions and limitations of forces and 
armaments in europe the statement said 
the alliances refrained from the accusations characteristic of 
earlier stages of the negotiations 
soviet ambassador valerian v mikhailov said a formidable 
amount of useful work had been done but that the possibilities 
to overcome differences seem to be exhausted 
he hailed soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs announcement to 
withdraw 50000 troops from east germany czechoslovakia and hungary 
by the end of 1990 and plans for reducing armies in several warsaw 
pact countries 
this unilateral major reduction mikhailov said mostly 
supercedes the very subject matter of the vienna negotiations which 
proved to be unjustifiably narrow and creates favorable prospects 
for forthcoming negotiations 
lambert w veenendaal the dutch ambassador speaking for the 
north atlantic alliance said that the two sides had gathered a 
wealth of experience and deeper insight in the complex issues of 
conventional arms control 
he said the blocs had reached a large measure of agreement on 
general aims and principles such as the aim of increased 
stability at lower levels of forces the commitment to limit forces 
after reductions 
veenendaal said some western concepts had become common ground 
during the negotiations 
he cited as examples the concepts of parity expressed in common 
ceilings collectivity strict and effective verification and the 
need to solve the problem of asymetries 
nato officials on monday denied warsaw pact claims that the 
western alliance maintains roughly the same number of conventional 
forces in its european arsenal 
nato wants the east bloc to make make greater reductions in their 
forces to bring the two sides to rough equality

a convicted georgia official told the fbi that 
his friend and associate health and human services 
secretarydesignate louis sullivan never tried to improperly 
influence him the officials lawyer said thursday 
reginald eaves a suspended fulton county ga commissioner was 
asked about his relationship with sullivan in a halfhour meeting 
with the fbi earlier this week the interview took place at the 
federal prison where eaves is serving a sixyear sentence for 
extortion said his lawyer charles r floyd jr of atlanta 
morehouse college school of medicine headed by sullivan paid 
eaves more than 34000 as a lecturer over four years while eaves 
used his seat on the county commission to support measures that 
benefited the atlanta school 
as floyd recounted eaves fbi interview he said that sullivan 
never sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a 
commissioner either as a result of his friendship or any other 
position he might have had with morehouse college 
they did probe whether he eaves had negotiated his position 
with the school through sullivan directly and he said he had not 
floyd said eaves also said that he was not sure whether sullivan 
was aware of his position with the school and that the two never 
had any conversations regarding his eaves position with 
morehouse the lawyer said 
eaves told the fbi he has known sullivan for some time the 
lawyer said the two knew each other while undergraduates at 
morehouse college he said 
the white house meanwhile said it was working on a request by 
sullivan that he be allowed to maintain a relationship with the 
medical school he founded possibly through a paid sabbatical 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater called the request 
unusual but don campbell deputy director of the office of 
government ethics told the associated press the office foresees no 
problems with that issue or with sullivans finances 
he and his attorneys were in here a week ago to discuss his 
forms and there were just a couple of matters that came up 
campbell said its simply a matter now of getting the forms 
written down because all the problems have been worked out 
a government source familiar with sullivans situation said the 
nominee had a specific written contract entitling him to certain 
payments for a leave of absence because the contract is so precise 
and was written quite some time before he was considered for a 
federal job the source said a federal law prohibiting anyone from 
supplementing the salary of a federal official would not apply 
campbells statement also indicated lawyers had found a way to 
avoid any conflicts between sullivans new job and federal aid to 
morehouse which in fiscal 1988 amounted to 58 million from the 
agency sullivan will head 
the white house earlier this week asked congress to postpone 
sullivans confirmation hearing saying that the financial 
disclosure statements and fbi background check were not completed 
the fbi had no comment 
a sullivan transition source said the holdup on the nominees 
confirmation hearing may be because his nomination was one of the 
last announced and because he is from outside the government an 
extensive background check is required 
this is a coveryourbehind town the source said 
an official at morehouse said thursday he has been asked by the 
fbi about sullivans connection to eaves 
they raised that among many many issues said dr james 
goodman executive vice president of the medical school they 
talked to me about a range of issues about dr sullivans fitness 
for the position of hhs secretary including that eaves and many 
other things 
he declined to identify the other issues 
goodman said he did not know how often eaves lectured at the 
school published reports said eaves lectured only twice over four 
years 
eaves was convicted last may on extortion charges he was found 
guilty of accepting 35000 from an undercover fbi agent in exchange 
for his vote on a zoning matter he had been suspended from the 
commission when he was indicted in october 1987 
he was sentenced to six years in prison and fined 25000 he is 
confined at the federal prison at maxwell air force base in 
montgomery ala while he appeals his case floyd said 
one of the proposals eaves pushed as a commissioner was to 
increase morehouses participation at grady memorial hospital he 
wanted the county hospital authority to allow morehouse to provide 
more patient care at grady 
jw pinkston executive director of grady said that the fbi had 
contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the atlanta 
region have told him they also had been questioned by the fbi in a 
background check on sullivan 
it was the usual inquiry they did not ask for any documents 
but asked routine questions which were very appropriate pinkston 
said he declined to say what the fbi wanted to know

in a retrial of those charges and in appeal of a 10year prison term 
for a felony conviction 
robinson a greenville native and halfbrother of jesse jackson

interview wednesday night with the associated press from chicago 
in a relative sense im better off today than i was last week and 
i thank god for that 
robinson was freed from jail monday on a 11 million bond 
i could have been facing 85 years and the electric chair 
tonight im in chicago with my family after being away almost six 
months with the opportunity for another day to clear my name if the 
state decides to seek a retrial said robinson whose businesses 
include a chain of fastfood restaurants 
a state circuit court jury in greenville convicted robinson 
saturday of accessory after the fact of assault and battery with 
intent to kill in connection with the attempted murder of janice 
desmond rosemond 
circuit judge james moore declared a mistrial after the jury 
failed to reach a verdict on the murder and conspiracy charges 
robinson faced in the death of leroy hambone barber and two 
other charges in the rosemond case

the administration said thursday that secretary 
of state james a bakers status as chief foreign policy adviser to 
president bush will not be affected by a revamping of operations in 
the white house national security council 
these changes are procedural and they were all worked out with 
secretary baker at the state department and they dont really 
reflect very much of a change they dont reflect any change 
actually in terms of whos in and whos out and proportion of 
responsibility said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
under the plan brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser and his deputy robert m gates will serve as 
chairmen of two highlevel groups that will meet on a daily basis to 
review national security and foreign policy issues fitzwater said 
the groups will replace the dozens of interagency groups set up 
during the reagan administration to deal with specific problems 
essentially its just a different management style that they feel 
more comfortable with fitzwater said 
on another point fitzwater said bush wants to hold down the 
membership of the nsc by law its members include only the 
president vice president secretary of state and secretary of 
defense frequently however presidents designate other people as 
members 
i know the president does want to hold down the membership 
just as he has in the cabinet as well as in other areas fitzwater 
said 
the nsc is not intended as a policymaking body although it has 
become that at times instead it is designed to be an advisory 
panel for the president on national security policy

customs officials stopped a 
shipment of chemicals bound for libya to determine whether they 
could be used to produce explosives or poison gas a bremerhaven 
newspaper reported thursday 
the nordsee zeitung said customs officials refused to authorize 
loading of the chemical hexamethylene tetramine for shipment to 
libya which has a chemical plant at rabta the united states says is 
capable of producing chemical weapons libya says it is a 
pharmaceutical plant 
customs officials stopped the shipment in connection with 
suspicions that west german firms may have been involved in the 
suspected libyan poison gas factory the newspaper said in a telex 
of its report to other news media late thursday 
it said the containers had proper loading papers and the contents 
corresponded to the shipping documents but customs halted the 
shipment as a precaution to determine whether they required a 
government export license 
the chemical can be used to make explosives as well as medicine 
and fertilizer and also emits a toxic gas when ignited the paper 
said 
according to the nordsee zeitung the shipment was from degussa 
ag in frankfurt it quoted company officials as saying the shipment 
did not require a government permit 
we have been exporting this chemical for years to a libyan 
fertilizer factory that uses it to enhance the effectiveness of 
natural wastes the company was quoted as saying in a statement 
degussas offices were closed thursday night and company 
officials could not be reached by the associated press 
west german officials are investigating several companies in 
connection with the libyan factory 
on wednesday prosecutors investigating a west german company 
suspected of a central role in the plants construction asked swiss 
authorities for help in locating the firms records 
prosecutors in offenburg asked swiss officials for help in a 
search for imhausenchemie company records which news reports said 
were taken to switzerland several months ago 
imhausenchemie of lahr in the black forest region is under 
criminal investigation to determine whether it violated export laws 
in with deliveries for the libyan plant 
several other west german companies have acknowledged doing work 
for imhausenchemie but deny knowing their equipment and blueprints 
were destined for libya

a 3yearold boy torn from his mother and used as 
a human shield during a gang shootout is the latest casualty in a 
plague of innocent bystanders being drawn into the citys violence 
greg alvarez 3 was wounded while walking along with his mother 
in a brooklyn housing project on wednesday when he was thrust into 
the middle of what apparently was a drugrelated dispute 
after surgery greg was in critical but stable condition a 
hospital official said 
three young bystanders were killed in brooklyn during the first 
three weeks of this year authorities say an increase in guns and 
the smokable cocaine derivative crack have made the streets more 
dangerous 
awful things have always happened but not in the same 
numbers said anthony bouza a former assistant police chief in 
the bronx who recently retired as police chief in minneapolis 
that someone would pick up a 3yearold and use him as a shield 
is not surprising not given the current conditions on the street 
said thomas reppetto president of the citizens crime commission of 
new york city a private watchdog agency 
you have a band of criminals out there who just dont care who 
they hit reppetto added 
the new york city police department does not keep statistics on 
the killing or wounding of innocent bystanders said assistant chief 
raymond w kelly 
but in 1988 at least 18 innocent new yorkers were killed by 
bullets intended for someone else and at least 49 others were 
wounded according to figures compiled by the new york daily news 
the killings and woundings of bystanders is due to a change in 
traditional attitudes towards human life the introduction of crack 
and the wide availability of weapons according to lawrence w 
sherman a professor of criminology at the university of maryland 
and the president of the crime control institute 
those factors combined with drug markets in densely populated 
places theres a high chance an innocent bystander will get hit 
sherman said 
drug gunmen on the street call the victims mushrooms people 
who pop up unexpectedly in the line of fire 
the 3yearold was walking alongside his mother modesta alvarez 
who was pushing a younger son in a stroller at 1235 pm when the 
shooting broke out 
two groups of teenagers handguns blazing shot at each other as 
they ran through the housing project in the east new york section 
one of the teens eric casseus 18 who was also struck by one of 
the bullets was later arrested and charged with having used the 
toddler as a shield 
most of the incidents where innocents become victims occur in 
poor neighborhoods such as east new york and a disproportionate 
number of the victims are black or hispanic 
the traditional rules of the street which frowned on the 
wounding or killing of bystanders particularly women and children 
is being stood on its head the fact you challenge these 
traditional rules show what a hard man you are sherman added 
now you have tremendously sophisticated weapons out there you 
have drugs bouza said if you look at the murder rate it used 
to be people who knew each other now strangers are killing each 
other

education department officials said thursday 
they have banned an indianapolisbased trade school from 
participating in federal student aid programs for courses such as a 
truckdriving correspondence course 
the nonappealable action against superior training services inc 
came five months after the justice department filed a 366 million 
suit charging the school defrauded the aid programs 
kenneth whitehead assistant education secretary for 
postsecondary education said superior misrepresented its course 
offerings eight years ago when it applied to participate in federal 
student loan and grant programs 
they are not now and have never been eligible whitehead 
said he said the students did not get the training and service they 
signed up for 
whitehead said the school had pegged its tuition to the maximum 
available to students under federal aid programs and padded their 
courses in order to meet the required number of hours for 
truckdriving correspondence courses that had a short residential 
site training component 
depending on the type of aid the courses are supposed to total 
300 or 600 hours whitehead said the lessons would have had to 
average 10 hours apiece to qualify he said i did four of those 
lessons and in each case it took less than an hour 
the indianapolisbased superior a subsidiary of continental 
training services inc operates a correspondence school in phoenix 
and training sites in arizona indiana california texas illinois 
and pennsylvania the school also has branch campuses not involved 
in student aid programs in pennsylvania texas indiana and florida 
the education department said superior has enrolled close to 
100000 students since 1980 and receives virtually all of its 
revenues from tuition income 95 percent of which is obtained by 
students through pell grants and guaranteed student loans 
rodger murphey an education department spokesman said the 
school is still eligible to participate in us financial aid 
programs for the residential courses it offers 
ward degler director of advertising and public relations for 
superior training said in indianapolis that the affected 
correspondence course was a combination of home study and driver 
training and that the schools other courses were not affected by 
the suspension 
regardless of what the department of education says were 
pursuing every legal avenue available to us to reverse this 
primarily because due process was absent because it is unfair to 
not just superior but to literally thousands of students that are 
currently studying with us and on behalf of the entire proprietary 
school industry he said 
about 20000 students a year take the correspondence course 
whitehead said sample tasks in a lesson plan include calculating a 
cars gas mileage and making hotel reservations to visit the 
superior school 
education secretary lauro f cavazos said such a lesson plan 
was an insult to those in this country dedicated to training 
individuals to perform needed tasks 
degler said the school was talking with the department about 
extending the course to satisfy the department he said the 
allegations about hotel reservations and gas mileage were 
ludicrous 
superior training school has been in business for 15 years the 
last eight years weve been accredited by the national association 
of trade and technical schools and national home study council he 
said 
an increasing proportion of federal aid is going to the 
burgeoning number of proprietary or trade schools for pell grants 
the figure was 27 percent last year and department officials have 
said they expect it to rise to 33 percent in the early 1990s

jim wright in his two years as speaker of the 
house has become accustomed to acting as a lightning rod for 
criticism the storm over a proposed 45500 congressional pay raise 
is subjecting him to his toughest test yet 
this time the current is being turned up by disc jockeys around 
the country giving out wrights phone number on the air by 
opponents who have generated an outpouring of tea bags mailed to 
lawmakers and by editorial writers in wrights hometown who have 
excoriated the speaker 
there even was a hunger strike aimed at wright being staged on 
the capitol steps by a local insurance salesman who said he is 
expressing the outrage of most americans over the pay boost 
they can justify it to themselves said bob walters 37 of 
gaithersburg md who said he had not eaten in five days but the 
ones they have to justify it to are the people who are paying for 
it 
the outpouring of public sentiment against the salary hike has 
forced wright a texas democrat to back away from his original plan 
to let the full 50 percent increase go into effect without a vote 
senior house democrats said that move was a sign of panic by the 
speaker and may have damaged his standing with colleagues members 
are turned off by the way hes handled it said one who spoke 
only on condition of anonymity this has permanently hurt wright 
but the speaker brushed it all off as routine taking the heat 
is part of the game plan around here he said its somewhat 
continuous 
first in an apparent effort to spread the blame wright sent out 
a questionnaire this week to colleagues asking whether they wanted 
to vote on the issue aides said wright was tired of reading that he 
was imposing his will on house members who wanted to vote on the 
issue when members were telling him otherwise in private 
but the move was received coolly even by those on his own 
leadership team im not dealing with the survey said 
democratic whip tony coelho dcalif when asked about it 
then on thursday wright said he will ask lawmakers to vote next 
week on a package to pare back the pay raise to 26850 and ban 
speaking fees and restrict other outside income 
many house colleagues were privately critical saying it is 
wrights role as speaker to take the heat for colleagues on matters 
such as the pay raise and that the new plan will leave them with no 
increase in pay for lawmakers who now collect the maximum in 
speaking fees the raise would be offset by the cut in honoraria 
income 
the critics members of both parties all of whom declined to be 
quoted by name complained that wright had been unable to withstand 
the heat even though he is politically secure in his fort worth 
texas congressional district and was unopposed in the last election 
it remained unclear whether the resentment would be lasting and 
whether wrights position would be weakened by the controversy 
hes always had difficulty with this issue said one 
democratic leadership aide who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity the reference was to a house vote to decline a 12100 
pay raise in 1987 that was meaningless because wright scheduled it 
the day after the raise took effect 
but if wrights strategy works the aide said all will be 
forgotten winnings the only defense he said 
wright since he took the spakers chair in 1987 has been almost 
constantly immersed in controversy on his first day in the post he 
made comments advocating a tax increase that drew immediate fire a 
few months later he drew the ire of republicans by holding open a 
budget vote tally until he could persuade a fellow texan to change 
his vote and enable the democrats to win 
more recently wright has been the subject of two separate ethics 
investigations one into whether he abused his office for financial 
gain and another on whether he improperly disclosed a secret cia 
operation in nicaragua both of those cases remain open 
but the consensus on capitol hill was that the pay raise issue 
had been hotter for wright than any of the previous controversies 
and there were hints that it might persist well after next weeks 
action 
i can assure you that a vote of the nature the speaker 
envisions wont be the last one on this issue in this congress 
said rep tom tauke riowa a leading pay raise opponent

fcc commissioner patricia diaz dennis said 
thursday the government must establish rules to assure that a 
cornucopia of video voice and data material will flow into 
american households over hightechnology telephone lines 
though dennis expressed reservations about the ways telephone 
companies might compete in the cable television arena she said it 
was time to end an era of television of scarcity in which a few 
companies offer a limited amount of programming 
she said she looked forward to the day when americans will have 
access to an unlimited number of twoway or interactive 
entertainment educational and communications signals carried into 
their homes by lasers on telephone fiber optic cables 
it is my job to think about what kind of networks we want for 
the future she told a luncheon audience at federal communications 
commmission headquarters what kinds of demands are really 
ultimately going to be placed on a telephone network or cable system 
which starts providing twoway interactive services and i dont 
think that we can seriously say its going to be plain ol voice 
telephones any longer 
she said regulations must be structured so that this cornucopia 
of services will blossom just not video programming and video on 
demand but interactive services for educational purposes medical 
purposes 
the fcc voted tentatively last year to seek public comment on a 
possible recommendation that congress allow telephone companies to 
enter the cable tv business repealing laws that ban such entry 
dennis said it was important to make sure that telephone 
companies would not be able to use their enormous resources to 
squeeze cable operators out of the market either through exclusive 
programming or by simply buying up the competition 
telephone companies should be required to build cable systems 
and thus they would utilize the potential of fiber optics she said 
also if phone companies are allowed to provide their own 
programming she said they must be required to carry other 
companies programs for reasonable fees 
she advocated an approach in which cable programming stores 
would pay to have their products displayed in phone company 
shopping malls 
weve got a store right now and that store is operated by the 
cable company and they decide what products go in and where the 
shelf will be and who gets to be the providers of services within 
that store she said 
what i would like to see is just not another competing store 
with the telephone companies offering video services but perhaps a 
shopping mall opened up thats what fiber really allows us to do 
because it has such high capacity if the telephone companies come 
in as common carriers then lots of stores will be able to occupy 
space in that shopping mall and the consumer will be better off 
because then the consumer will have an abundance of choice dennis 
said 
she said a major issue was whether or not the phone companies got 
to open their own store in the shopping mall and offer their 
products and programs over their telephone lines 
she said if the phone companies operate the mall the phone 
lines and theyve also got a store they might turn off the 
lights for everybody else and keep only their light on so thats the 
only one that the consumers would have access to 
another concern was crosssubsidization in which telephone 
companies would use telephone revenues to finance cable operations 
or vice versa she said telephone users shouldnt have to pay more 
she said of congress if we can set the landscape and carefully 
structure it so that the twin evils of discrimination and 
crosssubsidization are avoided or are at least contained well then 
they will listen im hopeful that we will get a very good 
reception

carlos andres perez was sworn in as 
president on thursday and called on the united states to help 
central america achieve peace and economic stability 
perez 67 was inaugurated during ceremonies that drew hundreds 
of dignitaries including vice president dan quayle and cuban leader 
fidel castro 
perez received the red blue and yellow presidential sash from 
his predecessor jaime lusinchi who presided over the oilexporting 
nation during a period that saw its standard of living drop with the 
plunge in petroleum prices 
the fiveyear term is perez second the constitution limits 
presidents to a single term after which they must wait a decade 
before seeking reelection 
perez first took office in 1974 the year after the arab oil 
embargo sent oil prices soaring he nationalized venezuelas oil 
industry in 1976 
in his speech perez promised major economic reforms and pledged

the new united states government has the immense and 
challenging possibility of seeing latin america as an area open to 
fruitful dialogue perez told the 2000 world leaders diplomats 
and politicians in his televised address 
we hope to work together to contribute to a definitive solution 
to the problem of the foreign debt as well as a peaceful 
respectful and promising solution for the central american 
situation the recovery of democracy in panama and the normalization 
of interamerican relations 
perez supports a peace pact adopted by the five central american 
nations in august 1986 calling for democratization and an end to 
outside military aid 
the plan has been hamstrung by reagan administration support for 
contra rebels seeking to overthrow the leftist government in 
nicaragua 
in meetings here this week honduras and nicaragua exchanged 
views on how to move forward with the plan through new proposals 
more acceptable to president bush 
the possibility of a fruitful encounter between the us and 
latin america will be strengthened if we are recognized as solid 
friends rather than subordinates i have expressed this to president 
george bush perez said 
the new president is also promoting a common framework for 
latin countries to achieve easier terms to repay their 420 billion 
foreign debt a major factor behind the regions economic troubles 
venezuela the fourthlargest latin american debtor recently 
suspended principal payments on much of its 32 billion foreign debt 
and is involved in talks with the international monetary fund to 
obtain billions of dollars of new loans 
the responsibility for definitive solutions falls equally on 
the united states the other industrialized nations and latin 
america perez said 
he said his economic program to be announced in the next few 
days will include a currency devaluation higher domestic 
interest rates price increases and higher public service charges

police in colombia have seized cocaine labs at 
a ranch with enough chemicals to produce 40000 to 50000 kilograms 
of cocaine the drug enforcement administration said thursday 
the raids by the colombian national police over the past few days 
netted 1200 kilograms of cocaine base as well as thousands of 
gallons of chemicals needed to produce finished cocaine 
hydrochloride but produced no arrests said dea spokesman bill deac 
usually all you get at the labs are small fry unless you get 
a chemist deac said 
david l westrate deas assistant administrator for operations 
lauded the seizures 
this may be as large or larger than the tranquilandia site 
seized in 1984 and we are extremely pleased with the aggressive law 
enforcement action taken by our colleagues in the colombian national 
police westrate said 
the raids targeted a ranch called the finca iglesias vereda la 
danta in antioquia which is 100 miles from medellin the base of 
the medellin cartel that us officials believe has been responsible 
for much of the cocaine brought into the united states 
the colombian national police raided the 17 buildings at the 
ranch starting jan 28 said dea spokesman maurice hill 
these labs hadnt yet gotten to the stage of actually producing 
cocaine said deac 
in the march 1984 tranquilandia raids which deac described as 
the record cocaine seizure in history 22000 pounds of cocaine were 
seized including 18700 pounds of pure cocaine hydrochloride 
ready to be exported and 3300 pounds of cocaine base he said

a block from harvard yard one of the 
universitys most notorious former professors is the top act at a 
comedy club but timothy leary said thursday his new career is 
simply an extension of his work in academia 
his message he said is no different than it was in the 1960s 
when he was known as an lsd guru 
tfyqa think for yourself question authority said 
leary he added that he does not regret advocating drug use then and 
blames the government for the current drug crisis 
im a performing philosopher said leary prior to his 
appearance at catch a rising star the performance i give at a 
club is no different from what i once said in class without getting 
heavy comedy has taken over from rock n roll as the first line of 
dissent these days 
but leary doesnt really call his act comedy he terms it a 
lecture that may be fortunate since area newspapers almost 
universally panned his performances leary however said he is only 
concerned with making audiences think for themselves 
i throw out an enormous amount of ideas said leary i 
strafe and strobe the audience i throw them curveballs fastballs 
i make them think 
leary 69 was fired from his job as a psychology professor at 
harvard in 1963 after his drug experimentation he now lives with 
his fifth wife in beverly hills calif and dabbles in educational 
computer software while making occasional forays on the comedy 
nightclub circuit to pay the bills 
in his act leary tells the audience im a little 
braindamaged you know that but he claims that in reality 
drug use has sharpened him 
im much better at my job of being a performing philosopher 
he said i feel i have one of the most efficient minds on the 
planet i see much more clearly 
leary maintains that he never advocated anything but the 
precise and proper use of recreational drugs for the purposes of 
mind expansion 
if the government had followed my opinion not to have drugs 
something we should be persecuted for and instead use them as part 
of medical education we would not have a drug problem leary said 
we never talked about lumping lsd with cocaine 
leary said he regrets that some lsd users committed suicide or 
harmed themselves 
we were deeply concerned that even one person might have been 
hurt by selfmedication he said 
but he believes the negative publicity about taking lsd and other 
hallucinogens in the 1960s overshadows what he considers a real 
tragedy 
i have to look at the comparative statistics he said the 
real casualties in the 60s were the men who died in vietnam and 
those who were psychologically crippled by the war if you want to 
talk about flashbacks the vietnam flashbacks experienced by 
veterans are 50000 times worse 
leary no longer advocates using lsd since you can no longer get 
it pure but said he still medicates myself if he feels like 
it he said he and his second wife took the drug ecstasy a few days 
before their wedding 
leary said he is happy though he is often broke and lives like 
a graduate student worrying about how to pay the rent 
you may hate me but at least you always know where i 
stand he said

trial in a case that tests a mostly uncharted area of family law a 
lawyer said 
at the heart of it are fundamental concepts of family equality 
and the right of persons who are lesbian to have access to their 
children attorney gloria allred said wednesday 
the lawsuit arises at a time when lesbian partners increasingly 
are arranging to have children either by adoption or artificial 
insemination 
allreds client terri sabol 32 of long beach is seeking legal 
joint custody of a 2yearold girl who was born to sabols 
thenpartner 
the couple conceived the child through artificial insemination 
using sperm donated by a relative of ms sabols ms allred said in 
a telephone interview 
when the couple broke up the 29yearold mother who was not 
identified allegedly began to restrict ms sabols time with the 
girl and refused to permit ms sabol to participate in parental 
decisions 
ms sabol sued on nov 29 to establish her rights as a parent 
we asked the court to recognize that this was a family 
although not a traditional one and that it would be unfair to 
deprive our client of contact with the child ms allred said 
the mothers attorney mitchell jacobs responded by seeking to 
dismiss the case in a legal motion known as a demurrer which argues 
that the court has no legal authority to consider the claim 
but on monday superior judge richard e denner overruled the 
defendants motion allowing the case to proceed to determine if ms 
sabol has a legal right to joint legal and physical custody no 
trial date has been scheduled 
my client has no comment on the case jacobs said after the 
decision 
ms sabol expressed relief at the ruling and said she had not had 
contact with the child for three months 
there are literally thousands of people now in my situation 
but there are no laws protecting us she said in a telephone 
interview 
the court has sealed records in the case according to a bailiff 
for denner 
roberta achtenberg directing attorney of the lesbian rights 
project in san francisco said she was aware of a halfdozen similar 
cases in california in recent years as well as a few in new york 
however there is no controlling legal precedent because no case 
has ever reached appellate level she said 
to gain a court hearing a parental custody claim typically must 
cite a recognized legal relationship to the child usually by a 
dissolution of marriage or paternity claim ms achtenberg said but 
neither claim is available to a lesbian parent 
without specific guidance from the legislature said ms 
achtenberg the courts have gotten stuck over their authority to 
hear a claim by a person who is not related to the mother and who 
is not related to the child

a federal appeals court thursday ordered a new 
delay in the imminent partial merger of the detroit news and the 
detroit free press 
the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia 
said the newspapers could not proceed with their planned combination 
of business and production departments which was scheduled to occur 
feb 6 
the delay was requested by opponents of the joint operating 
agreement 
a threejudge panel of the appeals court last friday rejected 
arguments by michigan citizens for an independent press a 
500member consortium of newspaper advertisers and readers 
the newspaper preservation act requires one of the newspapers to 
be facing the likelihood of financial failure without combination 
with a healthier competitor 
the consortium contended that former attorney general edwin meese 
had distorted the law in approving a partial exemption from federal 
antitrust laws for the newspapers last august 
the court in ordering the delay didnt say when the merger 
could proceed but said it must wait until there is a decision on 
opponents request for a rehearing on the issue 
gannett co inc owner of the news had no immediate comment on 
the court action said sheila gibbons a spokeswoman at company 
headquarters in arlington va 
this is surely a disappointment but i hope only a temporary 
interruption toward assuring a future for this newspaper free 
press publisher david lawrence said in a statement 
after almost three years the way we have learned to survive is 
to be patient and to hope that finally what is right and justified 
the joa will occur the statement said 
the newspapers applied for the joint operating agreement 1986 
saying the free press was in danger of closing without the merger 
the two papers the ninth and 10thlargest in the nation say they 
lost a combined total of 1557 million between 1981 and 1987 
knightridder has threatened to sell the free press if the merger 
is denied 
opponents contend detroit can support both newspapers and asked 
the court to order a hearing by all 13 appeals judges because of the 
extraordinary legal issues raised in the case they argue that the 
newspapers would suffer little harm as a result of the delay 
in papers filed with the washington court this week the free 
press said the joa was ready to move ahead 
it would be patently unfair to bring these activities to a halt 
because opponents cavalierly and belatedly seek a new hearing 
the free press attorneys said 
john kelly a michigan state senator who spearheaded opposition 
to the partial merger said thursday afternoon from his lansing 
office that the newspapers acted prematurely to combine their 
business operations 
my reaction is that its comparable to the soviet army 
confronting a small group of afghan guerrillas they had the 
firepower they had the high tech and they were defeated once 
again he said 
they moved ahead without trying to think through the human 
consequences for whatever trauma theyve caused their own 
employees they bear the guilt for kelly said

authorities fear that a hunger 
strike by 38 jailed leftist terrorists could lead to a new wave of 
attacks a spokesman for the federal prosecutors office said 
thursday 
the hunger strike began wednesday when 28 imprisoned members of 
the red army faction refused to take food ten more imprisoned 
terrorists joined the action thursday spokesman alexander prechtel 
said 
the hunger strikers in 12 different prisons across the country 
are demanding to be jailed together and other concessions 
as you know all previous hunger strikes were accompanied by 
terrorist acts prechtel said when asked if authorities feared 
another wave of terrorist attacks by red army faction sympathizers 
still at large 
prechtel spoke in a telephone interview from his office in 
karlsruhe 
the red army faction the countrys most notorious terrorist 
group has carried out numerous bomb attacks and assassinations 
targeted at the us military and west germanys business and 
government leaders 
the hunger strike brought the red army faction group back into 
the headlines after a relative lull in terrorist actions in recent 
months 
some leftist politicians have begun a debate among west germans 
by urging authorities to start a dialogue with the group in an 
attempt to get it to move away from terrorism 
several red army faction members have been pardoned recently 
after renouncing terrorism 
prechtel said only three convicted members of the group who have 
distanced themselves from terrorism and who may come under 
consideration for a presidential pardon have not joined the strike 
he said authorities have not determined what targets if any 
could be attacked by red army faction sympathizers 
prechtel recalled that the start of the hunger strike coincided 
with the fourth anniversary of the slaying of munich industrialist 
ernst zimmermann by a red army faction commando 
after zimmermanns murder 37 jailed red army faction terrorists 
announced they were giving up their 60day hunger strike 
that hunger strike was the longest of the nine similar actions 
carried out before the latest fast 
convicted terrorist holger meins died in 1974 after a hunger 
strike in prison and red army faction member sigurd debus died in 
1981 after a fast 
the latest action appears to be designed to avoid deaths 
according to a statement by a red army faction prisoner printed in a 
newspaper the group will fast for two weeks after that the hunger 
strike will be continued by two members of the group rotating every 
two weeks 
the letter signed for the group by helmut pohl said the jailed 
red army faction members were demanding to be imprisoned together in 
one or two groups 
they are also demanding freedom for four jailed red army faction 
members whose health the group claims has been damaged in prison 
the group is also demanding free political communication with 
all social groups and unrestricted medical care outside police 
supervision 
the statement signed by pohl who is serving a life sentence was 
published in the leftist west berlin newspaper taz pohl was 
convicted in a 1981 car bombing at the us air force headquarters 
at ramstein that injured 18 people 
among those on the latest hunger strike are such notorious 
terrorists as brigitte mohnhaupt guenther sonnenberg giesela 
dutzi eva sybille haulefrimpong and christian klar 
all are serving either life sentences or long prison terms after 
being convicted for murders bomb attacks and other terrorist acts

teachers are threatening to withhold grades to 
force resolution of a contract dispute prompting hundreds of 
students to walk out of class thursday as parents considered a 
lawsuit 
the dispute between the los angeles unified school districts 
32000 teachers and the board of education also has led to talk of a 
strike 
the students walked out of classes at several high schools to 
support the teachers wage demands and to demand that quarterly 
grades due friday be reported on official district forms 
thousands of students have staged similar demonstrations since 
midjanuary although not all have been in support of the teachers 
and some apparently have been only a way to cut class 
the teachers union united teachers los angeles plans to have 
members give students their midterm grades on a union report card 
rather than officially report them to the district after exams 
friday 
district superintendent leonard britton has threatened to 
withhold paychecks if the teachers hold back grade reports 
one group of parents is exploring the possibility of suing the 
teachers or the district or both if grades arent officially 
reported 
the teachers who have been without a contract since june 1988 
have asked for a oneyear pay raise of 12 percent the district 
offered 174 percent over three years during an unsuccessful 
bargaining session sunday union president wayne johnson proposed 
pay hikes of 11 percent in the first year followed by 10 percent in 
the second year 
johnson proposed at a news conference thursday that the seven 
elected members of the board of education meet with union leaders to 
resolve the dispute that would leave the superintendent and the 
districts negotiator out of the negotiating process 
the board of education had no immediate response to the proposal 
said spokeswoman tammy sims 
the average teacher salary at the districts 825 schools and 
centers is 36600 starting teachers earn 23440 the maximum 
salary based on number of years and a doctorate degree is 43319 
some high school seniors are worried that their college 
applications could be affected if the official grades are withheld 
but utla spokesman don schrack said thursday that applications to 
most colleges and universities would not be affected because less 
than 1 percent require midyear grade reports he also contended 
that any grade report accompanied by a credentialed teachers 
signature is official in california 
utla made the first moves toward a possible stike on wednesday 
when its 50 directors voted to ask that the unions 400member house 
of representatives approve a strikeauthorization vote by the 
membership 
however schrack said the union president would do everything to 
avoid a strike the union last went on strike in 1970 
he characterized the teachers pay demand as lower on the list of 
their concerns than implementation of a schoolbased management 
concept that would allow greater teacher involvement in improving 
the educational process in the district which has 594800 students 
teachers also are concerned about reorganizing the districts 
financial priorities to provide more educational materials he said 
in addition he said the teachers want to be relieved of unpaid 
duties such as schoolyard monitoring to give them more time in the 
classroom

protestant and roman catholic politicians from 
northern ireland met secretly in west germany a participant 
reported thursday and the bbc said they were exploring the 
possibility of a joint provincial government 
the british broadcasting corp said the politicians met oct 
1415 at the angerhof hotel between duesseldorf and duisburg and 
unanimously agreed they wanted to be partners in governing the 
troubled british province 
it said the talks could produce the most important political 
breakthrough since sectarian violence in the protestantdominated 
province flared in august 1969 meetings have continued in northern 
ireland since october it said 
catholic and protestant party leaders who were not at the talks 
divorced themselves from the report john hume the provinces 
leading catholic politician called the bbc version nonsense 
james molyneaux of the official unionist party and ian paisley of 
the hardline democratic unionists northern irelands two main 
protestant leaders also denied the report 
peter robinson who the bbc said was a protestant representative 
had been paisleys chief lieutenant but apparently has taken a more 
independent position recently 
deputy leader gordon mawhinney of the alliance party which gets 
support from both religious communities told the associated press 
he participated in the talks 
the bbc said that in addition to mawhinney and robinson the 
other two politicians who worked out the agreement in west germany 
were jack allen chairman of the official unionists the largest 
protestant party and austin currie of the moderate social 
democratic and labor party the largest catholic political group 
mawhinny said the talks were arranged by a german lutheran church 
official for a different purpose which he did not specify but the 
four politicians involved departed from the agenda somewhat by 
accident and discussed their differences 
there was a regular line of communication opened between the 
northern ireland political parties and great willingness to look 
at the problems of the other community he said 
the bbc said there never has been a northern ireland initiative 
to solve the provinces political problem and the fact that both 
sides had continued the secret talks at home for four months showed 
willingness to agree 
prime minister charles haughey of ireland said wednesday night 
behindthescenes contacts had been going on this is a delicate 
and sensitive area he said there is a fair amount of contact 
taking place britains northern ireland office the cabinet 
department in charge of the province did not confirm knowledge of 
the talks but said if the reports of contact and talks between 
the northern ireland parties are correct then the government would 
welcome them 
from its establishment 1921 until 1972 northern ireland had its 
own parliament and government including control of security forces 
britain handled only finance defense and foreign affairs 
with terrorist activity increasing prime minister edward heath 
decided in 1972 to end selfgovernment and impose direct rule that 
was followed by an agreement in 1974 to establish a northern ireland 
assembly of all parties 
that plan collapsed on the issue of power sharing and protestants 
opposed to joint rule with catholics conducted several crippling 
strikes several unsuccessful attempts to revive the dialogue were 
made in the past decade 
in its report thursday the bbc said the socalled duisburg 
agreement provides for a provincial government with power shared by 
all parties at all levels and control of the police 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army was not included in the talks the ira is fighting 
to end british rule in northern ireland and unite it with the irish 
republic which is overwhelmingly catholic 
more than 2700 people have been killed in sectarian violence in 
northern ireland since 1969

the state department responding to a news 
report linking palestinian radicals to the bombing of a pan am jumbo 
jet said thursday the attack has not been solved yet 
we are confident we will eventually find out who is 
responsible but we should not expect a quick solution spokesman 
charles e redman said 
asked about a cbs news report implicating syria and libya redman 
said the investigators have not yet reached any conclusion about 
who is responsible 
a total of 270 people perished in the dec 21 crash including 
259 persons on the 747 jet and 11 persons in the scottish village of 
lockerbie where the plane hit the flight originated in frankfurt 
west germany and then went to london before taking off for new york 
secretary of state james a baker iii said wednesday night he 
could not confirm the cbs report i dont know that any 
responsibility has been determined baker said at a white house 
reception 
according to cbs the attack on flight 103 was in retaliation for 
the us bombing of libya in 1986 and was also spurred by the us 
decision in december to talk with the palestine liberation 
organization the network quoted sources deep within the terrorist 
movement 
the principal architect of the bombing was ahmed jibril head of 
the extreme palestinian group the popular front for the liberation 
of palestinegeneral command cbs said 
jibril based in syria was working for libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi although he was also required to clear the operation with 
syrian intelligence officials the network reported 
gadhafi sent a distant cousin sayed gaddafidam to jibril who 
is known to hate the united states cbs said three years ago 
jibril told a news conference in libya there will be no safety 
for any traveler on an israeli or us airliner 
jibril a former officer in syrian military intelligence cleared 
the operation for an american target with syrian intelligence and 
with full backing of the libyan secret service moved to frankfurt 
west germany and made the pan am plane his target cbs said 
the network quoted omar shehabi a jabril spokesman as saying 
through an interpreter i tell you that we didnt do it and we are 
not involved we dont practice terrorism and we condemn such 
actions 
investigators are close to accepting that chain of events as 
the official version cbs said 
investigators believe that the bomb that destroyed flight 103 was 
put aboard in frankfurt 
in edinburgh scotland radio forth reported the bomb was planted 
by palestinian terrorists in the luggage of a cia agent 
the radio report citing information from unidentified scottish 
police sources said the cia officer was returning from beirut with 
five colleagues after a mission to negotiate release of the nine 
american hostages in lebanon 
scottish investigators refused comment on the radio forth report 
in december us officials in washington speaking on condition 
of anonymity told the associated press the cias chief in beirut 
was among the jets passengers they did not give the agents name 
radio forth did not name the agent it said was on the jet it 
said investigators believe a threepound charge of semtex explosive 
and a timing device were slipped into the agents luggage by 
palestinian terrorists who infiltrated the secret beirut mission 
the radio report said the baggage was shipped from beirut via 
helsinki to frankfurt where the agents caught the flight for new 
york the timer was believed to have been activated during the stop 
in helsinki the report said

president hosni mubarak voiced some of his 
harshest criticism of israel on thursday accusing it of 
jeopardizing relations with its stand on a disputed beach resort 
he said israel has been guilty of repulsive equivocation over 
withdrawing from taba a sinai border enclave israel seized in the 
1967 middle east war 
mubarak said the israeli position is threatening normalization of 
relations under the two countries 1979 peace treaty 
the tone of his remarks to reporters reflected exasperation and 
at times anger 
he made the comments even though the israeli cabinet on wednesday 
said it was committed to withdrawal it also agreed to follow 
recommendations of a us mediator to get talks back under way said 
a government official on condition of anonymity but no timetable 
for withdrawal was announced 
in jerusalem foreign minister moshe arens said he was 
disappointed by the criticism 
i think we are very close to reaching an agreement he said 
i think a little more goodwill on both sides will bring us to 
agreement 
there is no stalling we are doing all we can to finish these 
discussions as soon as possible 
in thursdays remarks mubarak charged that israel is dragging 
its feet on withdrawing the the aqaba gulf resort at the southern 
end of the common border on sept 29 an arbitration panel drew a 
border to within a few hundred yards of the resort 
the ruling seemed to put the enclave in egyptian territory 
however if the line were extended at a sharp angle the resort 
could still fall in israeli territory 
the egyptian leader said israel first sought to delay putting the 
ruling into effect because of its parliamentary elections last fall 
and formation of a new cabinet 
now they want another delay he said we want to build 
confidence but this method of equivocation and dillydallying does 
not inspire confidence this method is repulsive and we refuse 
pressure 
mubarak again rejected israels attempts to link withdrawal from 
the 250acre area with compensation for an israeliowned hotel and 
other resort facilities and access for israeli tourists he said 
withdrawal must come first 
two rounds of usmediated talks on taba last month ended in 
deadlock mainly over the linkage issue 
mubarak took office in 1981 and the taba dispute began the next 
year when israel withdrew from the rest of the sinai under terms of 
the 1979 peace treaty 
abraham sofaer the us state department legal adviser who has 
been mediating the talks went from israel to egypt on thursday to 
meet with egyptian officials 
an egyptian foreign ministry source speaking on condition of 
anonymity said sofaer had offered new proposals to both sides and 
that he was leaving for washington on friday the source gave no 
details of the proposals

president fidel castro of cuba said 
thursday the bush administration is less ideological than its 
predecessor and more likely to help achieve peace in central america 
also thursday president jose azcona hoyos said the leftist 
government in nicaragua would offer to hold free elections and would 
moderate its communist revolution 
castro who is among the world leaders in caracas this week for 
the inauguration of president carlos andres perez said in a 
televised interview that his talks with central american leaders 
indicate everyone is working in the direction of peace 
he said the bush administration is more pragmatic and less 
ideological than the reagan administration and can reach a 
political solution to the conflicts in central america 
but castro called latin america a barrel of gunpowder because 
its combined debt has risen while the value of its exports has 
dropped 
the five central american nations will hold a summit on feb 
1314 in el salvador to discuss nicaraguan president daniel ortegas 
latest plan for peace with usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
ortega presented the proposals on wednesday to azcona whose 
country is used as a base for the rebels known as contras 
the proposals included developing an amnesty program for the 
rebels reviewing the cases of political prisoners increasing 
private sector participation in the economy and holding free 
elections next year azcona said 
azcona after meeting with ortega said the sandinista government 
in nicaragua planned to tone down its radical communist 
revolution to deal with its economic and political problems 
azcona said that the series of problems nicaragua has in all 
areas made them realize that a revolution cannot be pushed in such a 
radical way and that what is best for all of us including them is 
a political solution 
of ortegas latest peace proposal azcona said if these things 
are carried through they will contribute to tranquillity in that 
country and then in our country 
azcona is to meet with vice president dan quayle who also is 
here for perez inauguration 
ortega is expected to meet castro before his departure for 
havana cuba backs nicaraguas sandinista government 
but ortega said this week that the conditions are not yet 
ripe for direct talks between nicaragua and the united states 
quayle said thursday that the bush administration does not work 
with the sandinistas

battlefield rocket systems and 1500 tow antitank missiles for 
kuwait 40 maverick airtoground missiles with an infrared 
guidance system and electronic warfare gear for bahrain 24 f16 jet 
fighters 100 mavericks and 100 sidewinder airtoair missiles for 
morocco and seven of the battlefield rocket systems for saudi 
arabia 
greece would get 60 m48 tanks and 100 harpoon antiship missiles 
for greece 
if bush follows through the proposed arab sales would seem sure 
to touch off a battle with congressional supporters of israel which 
is concerned that sophisticated weapons in arab hands could be 
turned against israel in a mideast conflict 
the list is classified a copy was obtained by the associated 
press 
charles e redman the state department spokesman declined to 
identify the weapons under consideration for sale he stressed that 
the document did not amount to a sale plan but rather to the 
administrations best estimate of other countries weapons needs 
each item has to be reviewed by this administration redman 
said 
congress has the power to block a purchase but only if a 
majority of both the senate and the house reject a formal white 
house notification of intended sale 
the informal list was sent to congress on jan 19 by the outgoing 
reagan administration the bush administration opened talks with 
congress last friday said a us official who declined to be 
identified 
currently the united states only shares the abrams tank also 
known as the m1a1 only with egypt the two nations have a 
coproduction agreement but the proposed sale would mean the tanks 
would be sold to nations other than egypt 
under the plan now under discussion egypt would be sold 150 hawk 
missiles 24 helicopters artillery radar and tank equipment israel 
would be sold 200 shoulderfired stinger missiles 24 helicopters 
and new equipment for its f15 jet fighters 
jordan again would receive no american weapons since 1985 
congress has prohibited militry aid to the arab kingdon until it 
agrees to peace terms with israel 
meanwhile the sources said that the white house in a cover 
letter told congress that the saudis are now deciding whether to 
request us or european fighters to replace over the coming decade 
their aging fleet of usmade f5s 
the letter said the saudis were considering jets to be jointly 
produced by britain and west germany along with the french mirage 
4000 and usbuilt f16s and fa18s

the senate on thursday night voted to reject a 
proposed 51 percent congressional pay raise but speaker jim wright 
said the house would let it take effect next week and then vote to 
reduce it to a decent raise of 30 percent 
the senate voted 955 to reject the raise for congress and other 
top federal officials and to change the law to eliminate current 
procedures which allow a pay increase to take effect without a vote 
then the senate gave voice vote approval to legislation to ban 
members from pocketing speaking fees or other honoraria should the 
pay raise take effect 
five senators voted against the package to eliminate the 
currentlyproposed pay increase to roll back the pay raise if the 
deadline is missed by the house and to require votes on all future 
pay raises they were christopher dodd dconn edward m kennedy 
dmass spark matsunaga dhawaii frank murkowski ralaska and 
ted stevens ralaska 
the final joint resolution was approved by a voice vote 
the vote against the pay increase was lopsided but largely 
symbolic since both chambers must vote to block it house 
procedures make it easier to protect a pay raise in that chamber 
and wright dtexas continued as the main target of opponents as he 
maneuvered to protect most of the raise 
house members public positions like those of the senate have 
been overwhelmingly against the 51 percent pay increase which must 
be disapproved by both chambers before feb 8 or it will 
automatically take effect 
but wright said thursday a clear majority of members now 
paid 89500 privately supported his plan for dodging a 
predeadline vote and then voting a partial rollback of the raise 
along with a ban on honoraria 
however the restrictive parliamentary procedure planned by the 
speaker requires a tough twothirds vote before the bill could be 
sent to the senate the 51 percent raise above the current 89500 
salary would remain in effect unless both chambers agreed to cut it 
back and house opponents vowed to roll it back to zero whether 
wright wins or loses 
it would be very difficult for the speaker to find twothirds 
for this resolution said rep tom tauke riowa even though 
wrights tactic would force pay raise opponents to appear to be 
voting to protect the full pay increase 
wright released partial results of a personal questionnaire 
showing 57 percent of house members opposing a pay raise vote before 
the deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the 
raise to 30 percent 
the 26850 pay raise he was proposing was a decent raise but 
not an exorbitant raise wright said compared with the 45500 
increase proposed by former president reagan and endorsed by 
president bush 
the 30 percent figure was equal to the amount of income house 
members could lose in a ban on honoraria the senate figure is 
35800 as they are currently allowed to retain honoraria equal to 
40 percent of their salaries 
house members would still make the same amount of money they make 
now he said the difference is we will be serving one master not 
two that is the american people he said 
actually most house members would find their incomes 
substantially increased since fewer than half reach the current 
honoraria limit of 30 percent of income according to their 
financial disclosures 
wright said it was his intention that all top federal officials 
including federal judges would receive the same increase under his 
strategy federal judges might still win the full 51 percent pay 
increase since under the constitution those new salaries cannot be 
reduced once enacted 
wright has met with house republican leader bob michel of 
illinois to solicit his endorsement of the plan wright was joined 
at his news conference only by four leading democratic members and 
the secondranked republican in the house supported the concept of a 
dollarfordollar tradeoff of salary for honoraria 
if we do an effective job of prohibiting outside earned income 
then an adjustment of that size would be appropriate he said 
whether we do it before or after the eighth of february is less 
important than whats in the package he said 
as the senate opened its debate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said also supported the concept behind the speakers 30 
percent proposal and said it was unfair to wright to take the brunt 
of criticism but he acknowledged the senate would follow public 
opinion and kill the entire raise 
if contemporary public opinion were the sole determinant the 
pay would be the same as it was in 1789 he said 
senate minority leader bob dole said i do think there should 
be a pay raise but he said theres no way you can explain 51 
percent 
although a senate vote to kill the pay raise was long expected 
the house leaderships original plan was to weather the storm of 
public protest and let the pay raise take effect then to lessen 
the political damage they planned action on a bipartisan package of 
reforms including an honoraria ban 
wright this week changed the course when he promised to hold a 
vote to kill the raise before the deadline if a majority of house 
members wanted it 
a subsequent associated press survey on wednesday showed 88 
percent of those responding favored such a vote but wright said 57 
percent of those responding to his private tally wanted the deadline 
to pass 
wrights survey exposes members to a charge of lying said 
ralph nader the consumer advocate citing the associated press and 
surveys by his own organization 
numerous public surveys showed members of both chambers would 
vote overwhelmingly against accepting the pay increase 
wright said the house would vote on rolling back the increase on 
feb 9 as part of an ethics package which would include 
an immediate ban on members accepting fees for speaking 
writing consulting or legal or professional services 
restrictions on travel expenses 
a repeal effective in 1991 of the law allowing senior 
lawmakers to pocket excess campaign funds 
wrights proposal came on the eve of the annual house democratic 
retreat at the posh greenbrier resort in west virginia which is 
subsidized by corporate and union donations

two explosions caused by runaway railroad 
cars rocked montanas capital city thursday cutting off electricity 
and forcing the evacuation of thousands as wind chills dipped to 70 
degrees below zero 
the runaway cars derailed and hit a propane tank near the 
railroad tracks setting off an explosion minutes later the fire 
from the blast caused one of the derailed cars containing a highly 
flammable chemical to blow up authorities said a second car 
containing plastic also burned producing a cloud of black smoke 
that prompted the evacuations 
the force of the 448 am blasts overturned automobiles 
shattered windows up to two miles away damaged a nearby college and 
homes and hurled pieces of railroad cars through buildings a 
quartermile away but only two minor injuries were reported 
its a miracle no one was killed or injured said ed schild 
lewis and clark county undersheriff 
mayor russell ritter estimated the damage at 3 million 
the accident happened as a severe cold snap paralyzed the state 
gov stan stephens shut down state government throughout montana 
citing the bittercold temperatures power outages and fumes emitted 
by the fire 
authorities originally believed that a railroad car containing 
polyvinyl chloride was on fire pvc produces dangerous hydrogen 
chloride gas when ignited and the belief prompted the evacuations 
and orders to stay indoors 
but authorities later discovered that the hopper car though it 
carried a sign indicating pvc was aboard actually contained 
granular polyethylene and that the smoke billowing over the valley 
was carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide 
it dissipates in the atmosphere and is not serious said paul 
spengler the county disaster coordinator 
but the fire proved stubborn and the blaze was still smoldering 
thursday night despite firefighting efforts 
fire officials feared the blaze could ignite a nearby tank car 
that contained hydrogen peroxide the chemical that exploded but 
they believed that a layer of ice that encased the car would lessen 
the threat spengler said 
the explosions occurred in an open area on the citys west side 
and severed one of three major power lines authorities said 
although power initially was knocked out for 37000 people in and 
around helena electricity was restored to most areas by 11 am 
authorities evacuated about 2000 people from an area one square 
mile around the burning railroad car said city manager bill 
verwolf residents were allowed to return starting late afternoon 
when the fire was under control he said 
in washington the federal railroad administration said the chain 
of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a montana rail 
link locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the continental divide 
west of helena 
the crew stopped the freight to exchange the lead locomotive 
for another lead locomotive with a better heater the fra said 
in a statement this manuever required them to disconnect the 
locomotives from the 48 freight cars being hauled 
when the exchange of locomotives was complete the crew 
returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone 
it said adding that the cars had rolled 12 miles east to helena 
the fra said the runaway cars hit another locomotive and 21 of 
the cars derailed one of those cars hit a propane tank alongside 
the track the agency said touching off an explosion 
the ensuing fire triggered a second explosion in one of the 
hazardous material cars the fra said 
i jumped out of the way from being squashed said mike 
mcnellis who was aboard the locomotive that was struck as it was 
switching to another track 
one paramedic was taken to a hospital after inhaling fumes 
firefighters wore respirators as they poured water on the flames 
evacuees fled to churches the helena civic center the national 
guard armory and schools which were already closed by the severe 
cold temperatures hovered near 30 degrees below zero which 
combined with winds to produce wind chills of 70 degrees below zero 
the national weather service said snow fell intermittently 
the weather couldnt be worse said ritter displacing 
people in these circumstances is tragic but helenans are tough 
people well adjust 
the collision occurred in an open area between the city dump and 
golf course about a quartermile north of carroll college 
if it wasnt for that golf course and the adjacent baseball 
diamonds wed have a lot of tragedies said lewis and clark 
county sheriff chuck oreilly 
nearly all windows were shattered at carroll college buildings 
the schools physical education center had portions of its roof 
blown out and pieces of railroad car dotted a snowcovered field 
near a dormitory a quartermile away a 1500pound railroad coupler 
fell through the roof of a dormitory but no one was injured 
authorities said 
our campus has suffered extensive damage said ritter who is 
also head of development for carroll 
bruce stewart a helena airport policeman helping with security 
at the blast site said a set of railroad car axles and wheels went 
through the roof of a home near the college but no one was injured 
jeff meyer said two windows were blown out of his house about a 
third of a mile from the blast 
the explosion shook the whole house he said i saw the 
flash of light between our venetian blinds i was thinking world 
war iii or something

president pw botha resigned 
thursday as leader of the governing national party but said he will 
carry on as the countrys leader after he recuperates from a stroke 
education minister fw de klerk was narrowly elected as the new 
leader of the party which has held power for 40 years and 
consolidated his status as the favorite to become the next president 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu a leading antiapartheid 
activist said that repression of blacks under de klerk likely would 
intensify 
botha 73 told party officials in a letter that he was resigning 
the party post which he assumed in 1978 to concentrate on 
presidential duties and distance the presidency from partisan 
politics he did not elaborate 
he is recuperating at his home in cape town from the jan 18 
stroke that weakened his left arm and left leg doctors said 
thursday botha was recovering rapidly but will need at least one 
more month of rest before he can return to work 
constitutional development minister chris heunis was appointed 
acting president during bothas recovery but he placed third in 
thursdays vote for a new party leader behind de klerk and finance 
minister barend du plessis 
as education minister de klerk 52 has tried to avoid 
ideological labels and has not been associated with major 
innovations last year he proposed controversial steps to reduce 
financial aid to universities that allowed demonstrations protesting 
south africas apartheid system of racial separation 
as leader of the national party in transvaal province de klerk 
has tried to halt defections to the extremeright conservative 
party he supports bothas policies of slowpaced reform that would 
lead to limited powersharing with blacks who are in the majority 
but have no vote in national affairs 
at a news conference in cape town de klerk declined to discuss 
his political agenda but said the party would change in step with 
the times 
he said he would consult with botha before proposing any policy 
changes 
a very special relationship will now have to develop between 
myself as leaderinchief of the national party on the one hand and 
the state president as chief executive on the other hand he said 
the national partys parliamentary caucus chose de klerk over du 
plessis by a vote of 6961 
the other contenders heunis and foreign minister pik botha 
were eliminated in early rounds of balloting 
wynand malan a liberal opposition member of parliament said the 
balloting indicated dissatisfaction with the oldstyle national 
party 
almost half the caucus opted for a more dynamic and more modern 
leadership malan said 
alan hendrickse leader of the mixedrace chamber of parliament 
said it did not matter who led the national party 
as long as the policies of the national party are executed 
there is no hope for south africa said hendrickse who was fired 
from bothas cabinet in 1987 after urging the abolition of 
residential segregation 
tutu said he believed party politics would prompt de klerk to 
take a tougher stand on apartheid 
i dont believe there will be any significant changes because 
they both come out of the same stable the nobel prizewinning 
activist who is on a threeday trip to britain told reporters in 
merthyr tydfil wales 
but there appears to be a split in the party and the new leader 
has to establish himself 
in south africa that means being a toughie and they cannot 
be trifled with he said i will be very surprised if we dont 
see an intensification of the repression 
south africas president is chosen by an electoral college 
dominated by the party that controls parliament the national party 
holds 133 of 178 seats in parliaments white chamber and it can 
carry out its wishes over combined opposition from the smaller asian 
and mixedrace chambers 
botha became party leader in 1978 when he was elected prime 
minister he became president in 1984 under a new constitution that 
abolished the prime minister post 
botha has refused to discuss his possible retirement but has 
said he wants to reduce his work load legislation is pending that 
would revive the post of prime minister to share leadership duties 
with the president 
heunis as acting president will open this years session of 
parliament in cape town on friday 
there was widespread speculation botha would use the occasion to 
call for a national election in april but political analysts say 
his stroke means an election is unlikely until later in the year 
the national party which enacted the countrys apartheid laws 
after taking power in 1948 is expected to maintain power in the 
next election

the house of commons on thursday voted down a 
measure that would have allowed civil servants to leak state secrets 
to the news media in the public interest 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government 
defeated the labor proposal 267179 despite the defection of 18 
conservative legislators including former prime minister edward 
heath who voted in favor of the measure 
the measure was a proposed amendment to the official secrets 
bill which is being proposed as a replacement for the governments 
78yearold official secrets act 
the full bill is designed to reduce some of the governments 
sweeping powers to declare virtually anything a state secret the 
bill proposes to decriminalize some trivial leaks and make 
prosecutions in some cases more difficult 
the full bill was approved in principle by commons last year it 
is now going through a stage where parties are adding various 
amendments which are voted upon individually by the commons 
heath said civil servants prosecuted for leaking official secrets 
should be able to claim they acted in the public interest if indeed 
that was the case he said a public interest clause was needed 
because the public had a right to know instances of wrongdoing 
labors deputy leader roy hattersley said the thatcher 
governments obsession with secrecy is not so much about 
protecting information necessary to our security but suppressing 
information that is embarrassing to the government 
but home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible 
for law and order said we have to take into account public 
servants who might have less good motives 
the bill now before commons proposes to confine secrecy mainly to 
defense security and foreign affairs 
but civil libertarians newspapers editors and opposition parties 
say the bill does not go far enough to protect individual freedoms 
of speech or measures guaranteeing news media freedom 
britain has no equivalent of first amendment or of the freedom of 
information act

pilots of two army helicopters that 
crashed at fort ord were on a training mission with nightvision 
goggles linked to numerous accidents an official said thursday 
capt michael d scotton 28 of laytonsville md son of peace 
corps chief of staff david r scotton was killed in the crash 
wednesday night the army said another soldier suffered multiple 
fractures and two others were released after treatment of minor 
injuries 
investigators from the army safety center in fort rucker ala 
were trying to determine whether the choppers working together with 
two soldiers aboard each collided before they went down 150 yards 
apart said army spokesman jim davis 
they were on a night goggle training mission said davis 
they signed out for the goggles but we dont know if they were 
wearing them at the time of the accident 
the crashes occurred just hours after rep frank mccloskey 
dind said a house subcommittee will investigate accidents 
involving the militarys use of nightvision goggles 
the soldiers signed out with the newer anavs6 goggles which 
have been in use since march 1987 an older model anpvs5 has been 
used since the early 1970s 
of 23 army helicopter accidents since oct 1985 11 have involved 
pilots wearing the newer anavs6 goggles said lt col john chapla 
at the pentagon 
he said however we havent been able to determine that any 
goggles have been a direct cause in any of the crashes 
fort ord spokesman guy shields said the newer goggles were 
specifically designed for night flying and corrected the problems of 
the older models which were intended for ground use but mccloskey 
said the overall situation has not greatly improved 
at least 62 helicopters have gone down and 134 servicemen have 
died in the past decade in crashes in which the pilots were looking 
through nightvision goggles the pentagon allegedly knew were 
unsafe the orange county register reported in december 
the military blamed almost all of the crashes on pilot error 
mccloskeys request for the investigation to take place later 
this month was approved wednesday by the newly appointed chairman 
of the subcommittee rep nick mavroules dmass 
the older goggles used primarily by the marine corps and the 
army electronically amplify moonlight and starlight partly 
improving night vision but also sacrificing peripheral sight and 
reducing normal 2020 vision to 2050 or worse 
those goggles can lead to eye fatigue and illusions the register 
said and tend to shut down in clouds and prevent pilots from seeing 
and avoiding clouds 
it had been cloudy and raining off and on wednesday 
in december mccloskey asked the army to prohibit the use of the 
obsolete goggles and accelerate purchase of the new goggles but in 
a letter delivered tuesday the army refused 
this decision is based on our safety record intense training 
programs and the acute level of safety awareness throughout the 
chain of command wrote jr sculley assistant secretary of the 
army for research development and acquisition 
in the crashes at fort ord chief warrant officer 2nd class tracy 
j gray 27 suffered multiple fractures and was in stable condition 
thursday at letterman army medical center in san francisco 
chief warrant officer 2nd class benjamin c graves 28 and 
warrant officer 1st class cliff l walters 24 were treated for 
minor bumps and cuts at fort ord and released 
the two downed aircraft were an ah1 cobra attack helicopter and 
an oh58 kiowa observation helicopter both were unarmed and 
assigned to fort ords 123rd combat aviation brigade said shields

princess dianas wideranging royal rounds 
thursday took her from a family living in a homeless shelter to fao 
schwarzs treasure trove of toys topped by a night at the opera and 
the visits first protesters 
cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess 
who thrilled some lower east siders by shaking some hands and 
accepting flowers 
the exception was a crowd of more than 400 irishamerican 
protesters across from the brooklyn academy of music where the 
princess attended the american debut of the welsh national opera 
a dinner at the winter garden of the world financial center was 
planned after the opera performance of falstaff 
charles j hynes a potential mayoral candidate said the 
protest is not directed against princess diana its directed 
against her as a symbol of british government which for much too 
long has inhabited northern ireland and depressed irish catholics 
both mayor edward i koch and developer donald trump were heckled 
as they arrived at the academy in a neighborhood where scattered 
renovations and new businesses contrast with dilapidated lowincome 
housing 
when diana wearing a white evening gown arrived by limousine 
with a police escort she was cheered by a smattering of local 
residents while the protesters loudly chanted ira ira 
koch spoke with her in a receiving line telling reporters diana 
told him she hoped her motorcade wasnt tying up traffic 
as for the protesters invoking the name of the britishoutlawed 
irish republican army koch said she didnt mention it i didnt 
mention it its part of the new york city landscape 
inside as she entered a balcony box the orchestra sounded a 
drum roll and a hush fell over the audience the orchestra played 
god save the queen the star spangled banner and the welsh 
national anthem 
from the stage koch told her i want to bid you welcome the 
city is graced by your presence we want to be sure your visit goes 
just the way you want it to be so when you go home you can say you 
had a royal time in new york 
also at the performance was bianca jagger who described diana as 
marvelous attractive beautiful and seems to be doing a great job 
as future queen of england 
at the upscale fifth avenue toy store fao schwarz diana attended 
a luncheon to promote britishmade toys and toured its floors with 
store president peter harris 
it must be fun to be in a place like this every day store 
spokeswoman brooke adkins quoted the princess as saying 
harris said diana stopped frequently to admire items saying 
oh this is cute and commenting that her children princes 
harry and william would enjoy them her favorite appeared to be a 
large white teddy bear 
she shook hands with several onlookers outside the store before 
leaving 
earlier thursday diana visited the henry street settlement a 
community center on manhattans lower east side that has helped the 
disadvantaged for nearly a century 
there she met linda correa a homeless woman who temporarily 
lives in an apartment supplied by the shelter and other women who 
were once homeless 
these are really terrific women the princess said according 
to the settlements director verona jeter who accompanied diana on 
her tour 
she was really impressed with them ms jeter said 
and 7yearold raamel correa was impressed with her shes 
nice like a friend of mine he said 
at the settlements day care center diana visited a group of 11 
children ages 2 to 5 crouching low to admire the valentines they 
were making and chatting softly with them she tied the shoe of one 
boy 
she complimented the work of another youngster saying i love 
the cupid in the heart is that for mommy related teacher janeth 
holmes 
day care center director karen leslie said of the children 
theyre crazed theres no ifs ands or buts about it 
hundreds of residents of the adjacent baruch houses project 
filled the sidewalks hoping for a glimpse at the princess who twice 
during her tour came as close to the crowds as police barricades 
allowed 
we can hold our head up high and say princess diana came to 
the lower east side said wanda morales who shook dianas hand

a former sheriff was arrested thursday and 
charged with hiring hit men to detonate a bomb that nearly killed 
the man who defeated him in his bid for reelection 
former lafourche parish sheriff cyrus bobby tardo 58 of 
thibodaux who was defeated in 1975 by sheriff duffy breaux was 
arrested along with a former policeman ralph bergeron 42 of 
slaughter 
us attorney john volz refused to give a motive or say whether 
tardo was after breaux because of a political vendetta 
its safe to say he supplied the money and wanted it done 
volz said 
the bomb made of pipe stuffed with explosives bullets and nails 
and hidden in a sack exploded dec 15 outside breauxs car 
injuring breaux 60 and parttime deputy sheriff daniel leche 62 
as they left a christmas party at thibodaux 
the bomb nearly blew off breaux foot as he was entering the car 
but he underwent massive reconstructive surgery and is recovering 
leche was less severly injured 
mike hall a us treasury agent with the bureau of alcohol 
tobacco and firearms said 20000 was promised for the job but 
only 10000 was actually paid to the hitmen 
he said former policemen marshall mcclendon 42 of slaughter and 
john tullier jr 23 of st amant both of whom were arrested 
tuesday were paid 8000 after the explosion and that mcclendon got

vice president dan quayle on thursday 
criticized former president carter for meeting with nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega saying such action has a chance of 
complicating matters 
quayle also criticized carter for comments reporters said the 
former president hadmade urging the bush administration to use 
economic persuasion in el salvador to encourage the usbacked 
government there to fight human rights abuses 
if hes calling for economic sanctions against el salvador 
yes hes complicating matters quayle said i dont think its 
particularly helpful for a former president to make those kind of 
statements 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
asked about the quayle criticism of carter said im not aware of 
what the vice president said nor do i have any reaction from the 
president i saw the picture of former president carter and danny 
ortega on the couch there this morning they looked pretty 
comfortable 
quayle on his first diplomatic mission as vice president was to 
stop friday in el salvador after leaving caracas he has said he 
wants to emphasize concern for human rights and support for 
democracy there 
asked if he has talked to president bush since arriving wednesday 
in venezuela quayle said no noting bush has laryngitis and a cold 
carter who like quayle was in caracas for thursdays 
inauguration of president carlos andres perez said wednesday night 
that he and perez had met with ortega earlier in the day and that 
ortega shared with them a new proposal to resolve nicaraguas war 
against the contra rebels 
he declined to discuss details of ortegas plan with reporters 
and us officials said they had not seen it 
but officials said they had heard from those familiar with it 
that it dealt with resettlement of the contras and carter 
characterized it as pricipally a matter between nicaragua and 
honduras which the contras have used as a staging ground 
the us government has refused to hold talks with ortegas 
government saying the sandinistas must first negotiate with their 
opposition 
obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads 
of state we dont meet with it has a chance of complicating 
matters quayle said at a news conference following the inaugural 
ceremony 
he said the us goal is to see free and fair elections in 
nicaragua and a regional solution to central americas problems 
during a current hiatus with no congressional money in the 
pipeline for the contras quayle said ortega should hold a 
serious dialogue with the resistance within his own country and 
neighboring nations 
we are going to give the diplomatic route a chance quayle 
said but he added that he felt the situation in nicaragua had 
worsened since the cutoff of us military aid to the contras 
this is a testing period for us to see if ortega is serious 
about following conditions set out in the 1987 peace plan agreed to 
by five central american presidents at a meeting in guatemala he 
said 
contra leader alfredo cesar also attending the inauguration 
said that quayle told him the bush administraton supports the 
contras but that he offered no specific commitment 
ortega and cuban president fidel castro met briefly in the 
caracas hilton hotel lobby thursday morning as quayle held meetings 
upstairs with spains prime minister felipe gonzalez and brazils 
president jose sarney 
the meeting with sarney centered on the latin debt crisis sarney 
urged quayle to consider the adverse affect that his countrys debt 
has on brazils ability to promote democratic institutions said 
quayle spokesman david beckwith 
us officials here said quayle is making no promises about the 
bush administrations developing policy regarding the debt 
quayles day also included meetings with presidents of costa 
rica guatemala honduras peru and portugal and a lunch with 
caribbean leaders 
you can feel the good chemistry quayle said you can feel 
the positive upbeat mood that theyre in in looking to dealings 
with the bush administration 
after meeting with quayle costa rican president oscar arias said 
he is encouraged about the new administration and is convinced 
president bush will hold give the central americans a chance to 
resolve their problems diplomatically 
but he said quayle didnt make any specific commitment on renewed 
contra aid 
arias also said he had not received anything new from ortega in 
the way of a peace proposal 
but president vinicio cerezo told reporters before meeting quayle 
that from what he has heard of the ortega proposal he believes it 
represents a political opening and is a good plan a good position 
to open talks again 
rounding out a long day of bilateral sessions quayle also met 
president alan garcia of peru before a late night session with 
portugals mario soares

portauprince haiti ap schools in a northern port city shut 
down on thursday after students walked out to protest a government 
claim that a peasant revolt was brewing radio reports said 
the government meanwhile said it has found new evidence that a 
revolt was imminent and said the developments justify urgent 
government measures 
the independent radio metropole said the students in gonaives 
charged that the government was looking for an excuse to crack down 
on peasants and opposition leaders 
tires were set afire in some gonaives streets but no violence 
was reported in the city 
the protest came after a memo from information minister anthony 
saintpierre advised lt gen prosper avril the countrys military 
ruler that the communist party and other leftist groups were 
planning an armed insurrection with large landowners 
the memo said the rebellion was being supported by the roman 
catholic church according to haitian radio stations 
the memorandum dated jan 13 alleged the insurrection would 
occur in the next few days and recommended that it be put down 
by force and even with bloodshed 
col carl dorsainvil the defense and interior minister backed 
the earlier memo said in a new statement 
this report provoked the immediate creation of an investigation 
commission the first results have confirmed the existence of 
certain problems which really justify urgent government measures 
said a communique signed by dorsainvil and broadcast by several 
radio stations thursday 
late wednesday nine political and union leaders in a joint 
statement broadcast by independent radio metropole called for 
avrils resignation saying he has shown his determination to 
perpetuate the autocratic and bloody duvalierist regime 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier fled to france in 1986 ending a 
29year family dynasty 
in his memorandum saintpierre charged that the peasant 
insurrection was being led by the peasant movement of papaye in 
haitis central plateau with help from the congress of democratic 
forces an umbrella group of several leftist organizations 
victor benoit the groups coleader who was named by 
saintpierre as an instigator of the uprising also denied 
involvement and said thursday he would sue the information minister 
today the life of every democrat in this country is 
threatened benoit said on independent radio haiti inter 
about 80 percent of haitians are impoverished peasants and many 
of them work for wealthy landowners in july 1987 about 300 landless 
peasants demanding land reform near the northwest town of jean rabel 
were killed in a clash with sharecroppers working for landowners 
avril became president after soldiers demanding a return to 
democracy ousted former ruler lt gen henri namphy on sept 17 
namphy came to power after duvalier left in 1986

the amtrak people have been super to us as for what were 
doing in havre were just kind of visiting and taking it all in

for the entire game if there is no victor the time will be reduced 
to a half hour each for the second duel and halved again to 15 
minutes each for the third game

a military fighterbomber crashed thursday in 
northeastern vermont with its two crewmen parachuting to safety 
just seconds before the plane hit the ground 
they were at about 1000 feet when they separated said gary 
boog a doctor who saw the crash from his car then the plane hit 
the ground and exploded and it just disintegrated there are parts 
scattered a quarter mile in every direction 
a military spokesman would not say whether the fb111 was armed 
but local emergency rescue officials told people at the scene it was 
not 
the plane a mediumrange fighterbomber with a twoman crew was 
based at the us air force base in plattsburgh ny which is 
about 80 miles west of the crash site 
the pilot was capt randall f voorhees and the navigator capt 
len j esterly jr said sgt annette crawford a spokeswoman at the 
plattsburgh base she said ages and hometowns were not immediately 
available 
the two ejected in a a pod a spruce tree branch broke through 
the capsule on impact bruising voorhees on the back of his knee 
said david eastman 34 a former air force sergeant who heard the 
crash and set out on snowshoes with a friend to find the two near 
his property 
the two crew members were taken back to the base thursday 
afternoon by helicopter 
state police said the two airman walked a quarter of a mile from 
the crash to a farmhouse where they waited for a car that drove them 
to a designated clearing off route 2 for the helicopter to pick them 
up 
he seemed to be a lot calmer than i was when i found out about 
it said trooper leo willey of his telephone conversation with the 
pilot 
the fb111 can carry nuclear and conventional weapons the same 
type of plane was used in the 1986 raid on libya 
the jet crashed in the town of kirby next to st johnsbury 
about 10 miles west of the new hampshire border it went down in 
woods less than a mile from heavily traveled route 2 boog was 
driving on that road when out of the corner of my eye i saw this 
jet flashing real low 
the plane was not on fire he said 
boog said he borrowed a snowmobile from a house and went to the 
crash site but found the airmen gone when he was told they were 
uninjured he returned the snowmobile 
lucy maroney was at her mothers when the plane crashed on her 
mothers property 
it sounded just like a jet was flying real low but then there 
was this loud noise that i thought was a sonic boom it was the 
crash she said i looked out the window and we could see flames 
and saw a parachute coming down 
donald godbut a state employee at cannon mountain ski area was 
in his front yard in neighboring littleton nh at 1145 am 
i heard an explosion and i looked up in the air in the 
direction of the explosion godbut said i could see a large 
giant puff ball of smoke probably 300 to 400 feet across rising 
into the sky 
the fb111 can fly at more than twice the speed of sound and is a 
sweepwing plane which means it can change the angle of its wings 
to increase speed when traveling at supersonic speeds

in a washington courtroom a judge is looking 
for that rarest of creatures the person who barely knows anything 
about oliver north 
the judge selecting jurors to try north is making some progress 
but the question arises will the jury that results be a 
crosssection of the community capable of rendering an informed 
judgment 
in the legal sense it will be a jury of norths peers the law 
only requires that it be a crosssection of citizens from which no 
one has been excluded by reason of sex race or other arbitrary 
criteria it need not be people comparable to north in any other way 
what judge gerhard a gesell seeks is a jury ignorant of 
norths activities people so removed from world affairs during the 
summer of 1987 that they were unaware that north told congress he 
had lied to it believing his duty to his country required such 
deception

house speaker jim wright is moving to limit 
political damage from an imminent 50 percent congressional pay raise 
by offering a followup vote to roll the increase back to 30 percent 
wright floated the idea of a followup vote on wednesday as 
house members nervous about the reaction back home to the 50 percent 
raise told news media and public interest groups that they wanted a 
chance to reject it 
wrights office said results of a private survey of lawmakers 
could be released today including whether members demanded a vote 
on the 50 percent raise that will become law next wednesday unless 
both houses vote to stop it 
senators are virtually certain to vote today or friday to turn 
down the proposal to raise congressional pay from 89500 to 
135000 house leaders initially planned not to hold any vote 
letting the increase become law but there were signs that resolve 
was wavering on wednesday

scientists say they are certain that a natural 
poison caused the massive dieoff of bottlenose dolphins in 1987 and 
1988 but they still are puzzled by the persistence of the deadly 
red tide that arose in the gulf of mexico and moved up the east 
coast 
we have never found this before in history said joseph 
geraci a wildlife specialist who headed a team of federal 
researchers 
speaking at a news conference wednesday geraci said laboratory 
findings confirm that the dolphins that died had eaten fish 
contaminated with a powerful poison called brevertoxin originating 
from the persistent bloom of red tide algae 
gerald scott a federal fisheries expert estimated that 50 
percent of the dolphins living off the coast were killed and said 
it could take 100 years for their numbers to recover

columbo is back but the first in a series of 
new twohour movies kicking off the abc monday mystery movie 
sputters like that old peugeot the rumpled detective drives 
peter falk is back but the plot seems to be a murder she 
wrote episode stretched into two hours was the show always this 
dull did it just seem more interesting in the 1970s 
the following week burt reynolds also returns to the small 
screen in his share of the threemovie rotating wheel bl 
stryker his show is a miami vice episode stretched into two 
hours but reynolds is wellcast as a beerswilling excop who has 
come home to palm beach after losing his cool and his badge in new 
orleans hes helped by some spunky writing and a fine supporting 
cast that includes rita moreno and ossie davis 
falk bless his heart is so overjoyed to be back in his old 
raincoat he overplays the part shrugging shuffling and flailing 
like ronald reagan with reporters shouting questions at him he 
seems too conscious of the character you know how little kids are 
unintentionally cute but then they get older and start trying to be 
cute and theyre not 
at least the producers knew not to mess with the formula which 
is exactly the same first we see the murder then silly us we 
worry whether columbo will figure it out 
this is an open mystery the audience knows the answer but the 
hero doesnt and theyre difficult to write in the premiere the 
villain is a psychic played by anthony andrews who beheads a 
magician anthony zerbe who threatens to expose him as a fake 
after about a 30minute setup we return from a commercial break 
to a darkened street the familiar coughing car lumbers into the 
frame inside a dark figure lights a cigar columbo theres even 
an appropriate pause apparently designed so viewers can stand and 
applaud in their living rooms 
from there on though the plot wears as thin as that raincoat 
that was once rumored to be hanging in the smithsonian institution 
it actually has been in falks closet 
columbo left the air in 1977 and falk went on to a 
successful film career hes enjoying himself in his old role so 
whos to complain theres a lot worse on network television 
reynolds whose film career has waned in recent years has found 
himself a nice little vehicle in bl stryker the bl stands 
for buddy lee 
a pan of photos on his apartment wall reveals volumes about the 
exfootball player his wifes face is carefully cut out of his 
wedding picture 
rita moreno plays kimberly strykers oftwed golddigging ex 
her most recent hubby is played by abe vigoda ossie davis is 
strykers old friend oz jackson 
the show is filmed on location in florida and comes from tom 
sellecks production company selleck is executive producer hence 
the same goodnatured feel as magnum pi 
in the opener stryker is haunted by his new orleans past and a 
bizarre string of sex crimes in pricey palm beach he tries to help 
the local cops while being hounded by a aussiesounding reporter 
from a supermarket tabloid i always wanted to be on the cover of 
your magazine stryker tells him right next to hermaphrodite 
gives birth on oprah show 
he falls for a psychiatrist helen shavers called in by the cops 
and tries to impress her by taking her to dinner at a fancy 
restaurant 
this is a nice place she purrs 
this is my hangout he lies i come here all the time 
enter maitre d excuse me monsieur you have to wear a tie 
after a predictable attack on a friend of strykers theres 
tragedy and stryker is left with a vicestyle ending gazing 
into the sunset while the strains of robbie robertsons fallen 
angel rise up in the background 
the biggest mystery here is how burt reynolds ended up as sonny 
crockett 
the third movie in the wheel premieres later this month gideon 
oliver stars louis gossett jr as an anthropologist who 
investigates mysteries involving strange cultures

for a small neutral country at peace for 175 
years sweden makes a lot of weapons but its arms industry is 
worried about the future 
the swedes build their own jet fighters naval crusiers and 
patrol boats artillery tanks and antitank guns rifles 
laserguided missiles explosives radar enough weaponry to supply 
most of its needs 
but the arms makers are worried because of cutbacks in swedish 
military spending and escalating production costs companies are 
trimming production and talking about merging 
its been considered part of our security policy to produce 
weapons systems that are necessary to defend sweden but that policy 
has started to creak at the joints said paul palsson president 
of the stateowned kockums marine ab which builds submarines 
sweden is too small a market to carry the arms industry it has 
you have to get out and export 
with a shrinking home market pressure to export has prompted 
some big companies to evade regulations banning sales to countries 
at war or even to regions where conflict is likely 
two businessmen are on trial for illegal gunpowder exports four 
executives of bofors ab the countrys biggest arms producer face 
prosecution on charges of selling weapons to iran and other persian 
gulf states 
the countrys military chief supreme cmdr bengt gustafsson has 
said defense policy may have to be redefined unless the military 
gets more money 
the defense network can no longer afford to keep the arms 
industry filled with orders gustafsson said his gloomy reports on 
the state of the military have triggered one of the biggest defense 
debates here since world war ii 
it feels unreal to hear the swedish military talk about more 
money at a time of international detente said majbritt theorin 
a leading member of the governing social democratic party 
dealing in weapons is a sensitive issue in a nation that 
champions world disarmament and where the swedish peace and 
arbitration society a peacepromoting group has been active for 
105 years 
but defense has become closely linked to economic goals for 
swedens welfare state and a population of 85 million full 
employment regional development and the wellbeing of the big 
companies 
companies at the heart of swedens civilian export industry also 
are involved in arms production 
automaker saabscania ab also builds airplanes 
ericsson the telecommunications giant also makes sophisticated 
electronic military hardware 
weapons makers employ 27000 people or almost 3 percent of the 
industrial work force arms exports account for less than 1 percent 
of total foreign business but they bring enough to keep production 
lines going 
the stakes are high in major projects like the development of a 
new multirole combat plane the jas 39 gripen 
the project which already has consumed roughly 17 billion is 
18 months behind schedule estimates of the final cost around 7 
billion are rising so fast that the plane risks being scrapped 
gustafsson told a news conference that the project could pay off 
in the long run but he added that unless the military got more 
government money it might have to take the cheaper option and buy an 
american plane 
georg harnsund head of saabscania said if the air force 
cancels the order it could spell the end of the swedish aviation 
industry that would cost thousands of jobs many of them in 
oneindustry towns he said 
sweden has strict export laws that effectively rule out selling 
weapons to the countries that use them most 
about 25 percent of total arms production mainly ammunition and 
explosives is exported but few of the expensive weapon systems 
have been sold abroad 
that will have to change if the arms industry is to survive said 
palsson whose shipbuilders secured a 25 billion deal in 1987 to 
develop a submarine industry in australia 
the australian contract including the sale of eight swedish 
vessels and the 1986 sale of 14 billion worth of artillery to 
india were the two largest arms deals in swedish history

farmers seem to always be looking for ways of 
adding to family income sometimes by moonlighting in town driving 
a school bus or by setting up roadside stands to peddle seasonal 
produce 
sometimes a sideline can become a fulltime business one of the 
alternatives to traditional cropsandlivestock farming these days 
it can include llamas water buffalos deer and ostriches 
a twoday conference last week at the agriculture department 
concentrated on lisa the acronym invented to describe lowinput 
sustainable agriculture it means producing food by using more 
sense and less chemicals 
mostly the meetings included case histories of farmers who have 
learned or are trying to learn how to reduce expenses by using less 
fertilizer pesticides and other inputs while making a living 
and improving their land 
the lisa program is part of an overall thrust by the government 
including legislation and 39 million provided by congress to help 
farmers large and small look at alternative systems for 
producing crops and livestock 
one of the components is the office for smallscale agriculture 
which is operated by usdas cooperative state research service for 
some time the office has been grinding out onesheet reports about 
the alternatives available to small producers 
some of the previous topics include sheep goats mushrooms 
foliage plants herbs wildflowers and specialty vegetables 
the latest onesheeter prepared by editor george b holcomb is 
exotic livestock and the report begins by asking about beefalo 
the crossbred critter of beef and buffalo origins that stirred 
imaginations a few years back 
wheres the beefalo its still around but the excitement is 
gone the report said such a query arises because introduction 
of exotic types of creatures into a country where they are scarce 
encourages speculators to bid prices extremely high 
in that case breeding stock becomes the focus rather than the 
basic use of the animal for meat work hide fur or feathers 
but american consumers affluent and with sometimes incredible 
appetites for exotic menu items can exert powerful influence 
for example the food safety and inspection service usdas 
agency that oversees inspection of meat and poultry has changed its 
rules to include reindeer elk antelope water buffalo and deer as 
exotic animals 
previously the agencys exotic list included only american 
bison or buffalo and cattalo or beefalo 
officials say fewer than 2000 exotic animals are slaughtered 
annually in the united states compared with more than 32 million 
cattle each year 
but because of rising demand from restaurants smallscale 
producers of exotic animals are finding it profitable to market 
federally inspected meat from certain species the report said 
meanwhile there has been a growing demand for other exotic 
animals and sometimes the prices are skyhigh 
for the moment the biggest dollar demand is for such exotics 
as ostriches and south american humpless camels such as llamas 
alpacas guanacos and vicunas the report said little demand is 
noted for alaskas yaks or musk oxen 
according to a quarterly publication llama life in 1987 a 
company called camelids inc sold 52 male and female llamas at an 
estimated cost of more than 1 million one buyer paid 100000 each 
for two breeding males 
some people predict that 3500 us owners of 12000 llamas 
will begin to price themselves out of the market even if camelid 
wool is sought by handspinners and weavers and the pack animals are 
used in sorts of fundraising events the report said 
llamas fabled pack animals in the andes of south america are 
often used for that purpose by the usdas forest service when 
venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on 
the environment than horses and mules 
unlike llamas water buffalos arent in great demand the report 
said but there has been commercial herd development in the united 
states since 1978 there are two types both used for work and meat 
the swamp buffalo or carabao which is rarely used for milk and 
the river buffalo which is noted for its milk 
breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate 
climates of italy albania yugoslavia greece turkey some areas 
of the soviet union and in cold mountainous areas of pakistan 
afghanistan and nepal 
latin america countries are beginning to catch on to their 
value the report said about 18 different breeds of both types 
can work in tropical mud that can bog down a tractor one of these 
animals can work as many as 20 years 
the european fallow deer is another farming possibility on the 
exotic side currently us restaurants import 500 to 1000 tons of 
venison annually mostly from new zealand but a problem with deer 
and elk is that a fence about seven feet high is needed to keep the 
animals under control a major expense in getting started 
west germany which has about 2000 deer farms still imports 
more than 20000 tons of venison annually the report said 
if large poultry is preferred try ostriches there are several 
ostrich ranches in oklahoma dating back to 1981 the report said 
pairs of breeding size adults bring 12000 to 30000 each 
depending on age and quality chicks at last report cost 1000 each 
at eight weeks when sex can be distinguished 
for free single copies of the report exotic livestock write

its a story fit for the movies 
two of this countrys greatest inventors george eastman and 
thomas edison got together one day to discuss the motion picture 
industry they were helping create 
eastman already had invented the process to make long rolls of 
film and edison had patented his movie camera both were comparing 
notes and seeking refinements 
at one point eastman founder of the eastman kodak co 
supposedly asked edison how wide the camera film should be edison 
holding thumb and forefinger about an inch apart said about so 
wide 
that width 1 inches better known as 35mm became and remains 
the standard size for the black celluloid thats been used for a 
century to hold the dramas comedies and happy endings that appear 
on the silver screen 
who knows if the story is true its been told so many times 
altered and edited that its impossible to determine exactly when 
or even if the conversation occurred said kodak spokesman henry 
kaska 
you just have to say legend has it kaska said 
this year kodak is celebrating its 100th anniversary making movie 
film which in terms of miles manufactured is the photo giants 
leading film product 
1889 is the year we sold our first length of motion picture 
film to thomas edison that much were sure of kaska said 
edison opened a production company and released 5000 movie 
titles shorts of vaudeville acts or boxing matches by 1900 he 
is credited with starting the entertainment form 
kodak always has maintained a subtle role in the movie business 
supplying generations of filmmakers from pioneers like edwin s 
porter dw griffith and cecil b demille to todays kingpins like 
stephen spielberg and francis ford coppola 
for many years kodak was the only practical supplier of film to 
the burgeoning industry and today the company still dominates 
its low profile dates to the days of eastman who refused to 
enter the movie production business and insisted on accepting cash 
in advance for movie film never a share of profits 
george eastman didnt trust filmmakers if a film lost money 
he didnt want to lose with it said chris horak curator of film 
at the international museum of photography in rochester where kodak 
is based 
moviemakers constantly visited the company offering a percentage 
of their profits to kodak in exchange for free film but always have 
been rejected 
that policy remains in effect 
horak said the nofreefilm rule also applies to a kodak program 
that supports young filmmakers who cant afford to buy film 
they give them money and tell them to buy the film horak 
said 
kodaks movie division also maintains a low profile within the 
company because the division generates about 350 million a year in 
sales a fraction of the companys 17 billion in annual sales 
nonetheless kodak remains the overwhelming favorite among 
moviemakers worldwide said jean turner associate editor of 
american cinematographer 
the magazine published by the american society of 
cinematographers has been interviewing moviemakers for 70 years and 
nearly all have said they use kodak film 
we do 12 issues a year and talk to at least three 
cinematographers in each issue i would say we usually find one or 
two that dont use kodak film in 1988 we didnt have anyone 
turner said 
horak said without kodak in the early 1900s there wouldnt have 
been a thriving movie business today kodak is by far the leading 
seller of all movie film in america although fuji photofilm co of 
japan and agfagevaert ag of west germany have started winning 
acceptance 
the foreign film has gained in quality over the past couple of 
years and as a result i think more people are starting to think 
about using it said fred austin vice president of deluxe 
laboratories inc in hollywood calif 
deluxe printed about half of all the hollywood movies last year 
and austin said about 80 percent of the film it uses is kodakmade 
fuji and agfa films are attractive austin said because a studio 
can usually get a discount by buying a certain amount of film a 
practice kodak refuses to offer 
so while filmmakers may insist on using kodak film to shoot 
movies a studio may insist on another film to make the 1000 copies 
sent to movie theaters worldwide 
more and more over the years its the bottom line that 
counts said austin 
there are primarily two kinds of movie film negative film used 
in the camera when a movie is shot and print film which runs 
through a theater screen projector 
the moviemaking process is identical to taking camera 
photographs involving a negative converted to a print 
the average movie at 90 feet of film a minute is about about 
90000 to 120000 feet long however much more is used en route to 
the final product 
kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative 
film than the finished product requires which means an average 
movie might use 18 million feet of film 
if 1000 prints are needed a studio must buy 90 million feet of 
print film 
kodak sells its most popular negative film in a 400foot roll 
priced at about 34 cents a foot its most popular print film comes 
in a 4000foot roll costing about 6 cents a foot 
fuji sells its most versatile negative film for about 31 cents a 
foot 
increased competition may be one reason kodak is blowing its horn 
about its long history in movies 
although the company has won five oscars three emmys and two 
special scientific awards for technical breakthroughs in the movie 
industry kodak still feels a little taken for granted company 
officials said 
kodaks role in the movie business is not unlike texacos or 
mobils role in the automobile industry said joerge agin vice 
president and general manager of kodaks motion picture and 
audiovisual products division

here are some highlights of kodaks 100

dramatic films become practical 
1929 first film is made especially for sound motion pictures

1974 eastman color negative ii film 5247 the companys most

the government agency that investigated the 
mammoth drexel burnham lambert inc securities fraud case wont see 
a penny of a record 650 million settlement 
in fact the securities and exchange commission considered 
chronically understaffed and underfunded isnt even allowed to 
spend the money it raises through routine stock licensing fees 
which amounted to twice its budget last year 
to put it in perspective the government agency assigned to 
investigate financial institutions where hundreds of millions of 
dollars change handsdaily has a budget of 1426 million this year 
the us military bands are getting 1675 million 
it doesnt hamstring you you just cant get to the work 
stanley sporkin a us district court judge in washington who was 
the secs enforcement director from 197481 said wednesday of the 
agencys budget woes 
i didnt believe we were seeing even 10 percent of the 
wrongdoing that was out there and i think that remains the fact 
today sporkin said 
with the government pledging to increase firepower against 
securities fraud in the wake of the drexel case and a commodities 
probe in chicago many officials want to see the sec receive more 
funding possibly by retaining some of its securitieslicensing fees 
the problem at the moment is that over the last two to three 
years we got involved in some important investigations cases like 
dennis levine ivan boesky drexel which required the devotion of 
our resources current sec enforcement director gary lynch said 
obviously were not going to take staff away from ongoing 
litigation but right now we are getting hurt 
the three wall street fraud cases lynch mentioned all produced 
huge settlements 
under drexels plea agreement with the sec made public last 
month the investment giant must pay 300 million in criminal fines 
and civil penalties the remaining 350 million is to be placed in 
an escrow account to cover payments to investors who may sue to 
recover losses from drexels actions 
levine an exdrexel managing director in june 1986 agreed to 
repay 116 million in illegal gains from insider trading the use 
of nonpublic information to profit in stock transactions 
cooperation by levine led the sec to boesky the nowimprisoned 
speculator who in november 1986 agreed to pay 100 million in 
insider trading penalties 
in fiscal 1987 the sec obtained court orders for defendants to 
return about 121 million in illicit profits more than 70 million 
of that came from insider trading cases another 626 million was 
ordered in civil penalties for insider trading 
no one publicly has suggested allowing the sec to use the money 
it rakes in for government coffers which would make the agency 
something like a meter maid for securities investigations 
its a real problem because you dont want the agency that is 
going to be using the fines to have an incentive to fine people 
said sporkin the federal judge 
under longstanding guidelines the sec has required violators of 
federal securities laws to disgorge or return illicit profits 
as the number of insider trading cases grew the sec pressed for 
and congress enacted the insider trading sanctions act of 1984 
which empowered the commission to seek courtordered fines in 
addition to disgorgement 
some investigators also want the commission to be able to levy 
fines for relatively minor infractions rather than just being able 
to suspend guilty brokers under current guidelines only judges in 
civil and criminal cases can fine securitieslaw violators 
the secs 1426 million budget for fiscal 1989 is up from 1352 
million last year revenue from securitiesregistration fees for the 
year is projected at 252 million but as with penalties the sec 
cant spend a cent of it 
thats where change is expected sec chairman david ruder in 
december proposed that the commission adopt some form of 
selffunding such as retaining part of its fees 
ruder told a house panel the sec may have allowed some 
investigations including enforcement of fraud in penny stocks 
which are traded overthecounter for a few dollars or less to 
slip because of underfunding and understaffing 
given the current inadequacies of the secs resources 
selffunding makes admirable good sense and ill be working toward 
that end rep john dingell dmich chairman of the oversight 
and investigations subcommittee of the house energy and commerce 
committee said wednesday 
a recent sec report said the annual turnover rate for staff 
attorneys is 20 percent and that half of sec lawyers have less than 
three years experience the starting salary for commission lawyers 
is 27172 
ira lee sorkin a former head of the secs new york office said 
bureau staffing there fell to 185 in september 1986 from 225 in 
november 1980 the same period during which the stock market surged 
and insider trading scandals were exposed 
with more staff he said youll have more cases youll have 
more ability to police the industry surely it would help

a small manufacturer of soybean products 
has pulled off a coup of sorts by getting a major supermarket chain 
waldbaums foodmart to make room in some of its dairy cases for 
fresh soy milk 
the ambrosia soy co does not expect consumers to immediately 
begin gulping down its sweetsoy soy milk but owner liz appel says a 
major hurdle has been cleared just by getting the cholesteroland 
lactosefree product a place next to cows milk 
its very exciting i still cant figure out how we did it 
said appel 35 who was a senior consultant for a big eight 
accounting firm before opening her soybean product business in 1987 
waldbaums a holyoke massbased company will begin carrying 
the product this month on a trial basis at stores in several 
connecticut locations a spokesman said waldbaums has 43 stores in 
connecticut and massachusetts 
we try to be first with those items that potentially indicate 
new trends even if it sold marginally we would possibly expand it 
because of its uniqueness said john lucey dairy 
buyermerchandiser for waldbaums 
waldbaums is believed to be the first major supermarket chain on 
the east coast to carry fresh soy milk in its dairy section 
according to appel and peter goblitz president of soyatech a 
market research firm in maine that follows the soybean industry 
goblitz said ambrosias accomplishment is significant in two 
respects the company has managed to get a major supermarket chain 
to sell fresh soy milk and also to put it in the dairy counter 
for soy milk to reach the mainstream market it is going to have 
to entice the people who look in the dairy case regularly goblitz 
said 
goblitz said he will be interested in seeing how the 
supermarketshopping public takes to the product and how dairy 
companies respond 
by being in there she is taking over someone elses turf he 
said 
lucey said he expected the products main appeal will be to those 
who drink skim milk or no milk at all 
i think it is a completely different customer i dont really 
think its any threat to the dairy industry he said 
still the dairy industry is likely to keep a close eye on the 
development austin tanner the former chairman of the connecticut 
farm bureaus dairy committee said wednesday 
most of the soy milk sold in the united states is packaged in 
aseptic containers that do not require refrigeration and have long 
shelf lives health food and asianamerican stores account for 
probably 95 percent of all sales goblitz said 
some people may not like the taste of soy milk at first appel 
acknowledged tuesday she says it has a slightly nutty flavor but 
others say the description is generous describing it as bland and 
watery 
we are definitely going to have to do an educational program 
said appel her company will provide instore sampling of soy milk 
next month 
soy milk may be put on cereal used in recipes or sipped by the 
glassful just like dairy milk appel said 
sales of soy milk which is about three times more expensive than 
dairy milk have increased 425 percent in the united states since 
1983 or up to 46 million gallons last year according to goblitz 
in most of the products oil is added to create a better flavor 
and better mouth feel goblitz said a sweetener is also usually 
added 
waldbaums will be carrying ambrosias chocolate and vanilla soy 
milk as well as the companys plain product which is made only of 
soybean soy lecithin and water appel said ambrosia buys 
organically grown soybeans from iowa 
in japan soy milk is so commonplace it is sold in vending 
machines appel noted 
we want to be the soy milkman of the east coast she said

a special chicago mercantile exchange panel has 
appointed a futures regulation expert to help examine possible 
changes in trading practices now under scrutiny in a federal fraud 
investigation 
the ninemember special committee to review trading practices 
appointed robert wilmouth president of the national futures 
association to assist in the review of trading procedure and 
policy chicago merc spokesman andrew yemma said after the panel 
held its first meeting wednesday 
the futures association is the industrys selfregulatory 
organization 
the federal government is investigating allegations that as many 
as 100 brokers and traders at the merc and the chicago board of 
trade systematically cheated investors out of millions of dollars 
through illegal trading practices the ongoing twoyear probe was 
disclosed two weeks ago 
proposals for changes at the merc are expected in two to three 
months the proposals would then be submitted to the commodity 
futures trading commission the federal agency that regulates the 
industry for approval yemma said 
reporters were not allowed into wednesdays meeting described by 
yemma as the first in a series planned in chicago and new york to 
discuss trading rules and procedures 
meanwhile the cftc was to vote in washington today on 
implementation of the mercs proposed globex electronic trading 
system a key element in the exchanges move to set up afterhours 
global futures trading electronic trading also is seen by some as a 
way to help police improper activity by more closely monitoring 
deals 
the commissions staff has recommended that globex be approved 
despite criticism from the bot that computerized trading opens the 
industry to hackers and does not eliminate fraud 
the house agriculture committee on wednesday designated rep 
glenn english dokla to direct a congressional investigation into 
trading practices in the futures and options markets 
english chairman of the panels subcommittee on conservation 
credit and rural development said the probe would focus on the 
cftcs regulation of the markets and on the selfregulating ability 
of the markets themselves 
in establishing the special panel at the merc last week leo 
melamed chairman of the exchanges executive committee said there 
would be no sacred cows in the examination of trading practices 
in the market 
among the practices that will come under scrutiny is dual 
trading melamed said in which traders can buy and sell for 
themselves and a customer simultaneously 
critics say the longtime practice invites abuse of the 
traditional openoutcry style of commodities trading 
abs partners the most powerful group of brokers in the exchange 
has banned the practice to avoid an appearance of conflict of 
interest the wall street journal reported wednesday 
there is some support among traders for elimination of dual 
trading 
its a conflict of interest its me before the customer and i 
dont think its right said gene sikora who trades for henning amp 
krajewski trading co a chicagobased commodities brokerage 
officials at the bot are also examining trading practices 
chairman karsten mahlmann told traders this week the exchange is 
considering eliminating dual trading and is exploring the 
feasibility of electronic trading

a malaysian trade group has begun an advertising 
campaign in the united states aimed at countering what it calls 
scare tactics of competitors and health advocates who say palm oil 
leads to heart disease 
the malaysian oil palm growers council today placed a full page 
advertisement headlined to the american people the facts about 
palm oil in the new york times 
initial scientific research has provided evidence that palm oil 
is healthy and nutritious the ad said in part 
malaysias primary industries minister lim keng yaik announced 
last week that the palm oil producers in malaysia had set up a 369 
million fund for a counterattack 
since we are the worlds biggest producer and exporter of palm 
oil we cannot let this go unchallenged we have to nail the lie 
lim said 
he said the campaign would include advertisements in us 
newspapers refuting studies that found highly saturated tropical 
oils like palm and coconut increase blood cholesterol and lead to 
heart disease 
groups like the american soybean association and the national 
heart savers association began an antipalm oil campaign in 1987 
and major us food processors such as general mills inc kellogg 
co and pillsbury co have responded with announcements that they no 
longer use tropical oils in their cookies crackers and other 
products 
a delegation of malaysian government officials palm oil 
producers exporters and scientists plans to present evidence from 
their own study rebutting the charges to the national institute of 
palm oil processors meeting in tucson ariz in march 
malaysian exports account for 65 percent of total world palm oil 
exports the industry generates about 2 billion in revenue

the european economic community has 
agreed to allow indonesia to export 255 million knitted garments to 
the eec this year the largest quota granted any supplier a textile 
trade group said thursday 
hong kong previously the largest supplier of knitted garments to 
the 12nation trading bloc was given a quota of 2532 million 
pieces said chamrul djafri an executive of the indonesian textile 
association 
the quota agreement was reached in a threeday meeting that ended 
here wednesday it was the first time the eec had set a limit for 
indonesian exports of knitted garments including mens shirts 
tshirts and underwear 
sharp increases over the past few years in its imports of the 
products from indonesia prompted the eec to impose the quota this 
year djafri said 
indonesias exports of knitted garments to the eec jumped from 
12 million pieces in 1984 to 121 million in 1987 as of september 
1988 exports had reached 188 million pieces 
the eec is indonesias second largest textile customer after the 
united states it accounted for about 20 percent of the countrys

nippon telegraph and telephone corp said thursday 
it has developed a tiny new transistor that can be used to build 
smaller speedier computers and provide clearer pictures on 
television sets 
the new quantum wire transistor uses wires onetenth the 
thickness of conventional transistors and can be used to perform 
calculations at six times the speed possible with existing high 
electron mobility transistors said an ntt spokesman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
many transistors go into a computer and the spokesman said the 
small size of the new type would permit the development of laptop 
highspeed computers 
he said the transistor uses wires 5 nanometers thick one 
nanometer equals onemillionth of a millimeter he added 
he said the transistor also could be used to develop more 
sophisticated amplifiers for receiving broadcast waves from 
satellites and other objects in space this would help provide 
clearer pictures on television sets 
development of quantum wire transistors is also going on 
elsewhere in japan and in the united states

the general accounting office today recommended 
that the government deal with the savings and loan crisis by 
promptly taking control of all failed institutions 
the gao the congressional auditing and investigative agency 
told the senate banking committee that regulators should place any 
of the 350 insolvent institutions remaining open into receivership 
whenever necessary until a decision can be made to liquidate them or 
merge them with stronger partners 
of fundamental importance these institutions must be 
effectively isolated from the rest of the depository institutions 
industry to prevent them from competing with healthy institutions 
said charles o bowsher the head of the gao 
their operations must be limited to investing in highgrade 
securities managing bad assets on their books and accepting 
deposits at prevailing market rates he said bowsher said sampl 
regulators should enlist help from state officials and from federal 
regulators of commercial banks to accomplish this task he said 
congress must reach agreement as soon as possible on the sampl crisis 
or this process could not get started 
we estimate that to fully pay for deposit insurance losses 
and to put the federal savings and loan insurance corp back on a 
solid financial footing it will cost at least 85 billion more than 
fslic currently anticipates receiving in revenue over the next 10 
years he said 
delay will only increase this cost bowsher said 
delay would also permit weak institutions to squander our 
nations wealth on questionable economic endeavors weaken the 
entire financial system because healthy institutions must match the 
high interest rates paid by weak thrifts and create pressure on 
regulators to lower standards for the entire industry to accommodate 
weak sampls he said 
bowsher also said that congress while providing more money 
should also reform the system and improve its methods of rescuing 
failed sampls 
he said the fslic should be made independent of its parent 
agency the federal home loan bank board and that healthy and 
unhealthy sampls should be put into separate insurance funds so that 
tougher rules can fairly be applied to the good sampls right away 
bowsher whose agency is studying last years rescue of 205 sampls 
at an estimated cost of 31 billion said we have serious 
reservations about the way the bank board proceeded 
he said the bank board relies too heavily on methods that 
preserve cash and spread the cost of any rescues over 10 years 
it is questionable whether many of these mergers really save 
the government money compared to other options that would be 
possible if fslic had the money to resolve cases he said

sales of new homes increased 06 percent in december while sales 
for the whole year rebounded slightly after plunging during 1987 
the government reported today 
the commerce department said 1988 sales totaled 677000 units up 
09 percent from the 671000 sold during the previous year last 
years level was the highest since 750000 homes were sold in 1986 
home sales had plunged 105 percent in 1987 with the decrease 
blamed on higher mortgage interest rates and a slowdown in demand 
after five strong sales years 
decembers increase pushed the seasonally adjusted annual sales 
rate to 669000 for the month up from 665000 in november when 
sales had been down 79 percent 
on wednesday the government reported that its chief economic 
forecasting gauge posted a strong 06 percent gain in december 
continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said portends slower 
growth in 1989 
the index of leading economic indicators has reversed course in 
each of the last nine months showing little forward momentum 
decembers increase left the index at 1946 percent of its 1967 base 
of 100 up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier 
economists welcomed wednesdays report from the commerce 
department as a precursor to slower more sustainable growth during 
the economic expansions seventh year saying restraint would help 
keep inflation in check without threatening a serious downturn 
wall street was unimpressed by the report however as stocks 
turned in a mixed showing the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
slipped 411 points to 233821 
in another report wednesday the commerce department said 
construction spending shot up 25 percent in december to end a weak 
year on a strong note 
construction spending for all of 1988 totaled 4034 billion up 
just 11 percent from 1987 taking inflation into account spending 
actually was down 04 percent it was the slowest performance since 
the recession year of 1982 
the economy is going to be slowing down but there is no 
recession on the horizon said economist david wyss of data 
resources inc in lexington mass 
wyss predicted that by the middle of next year growth would slow 
enough for the federal reserve board to ease its tight grip on the 
money supply since march the central bank has been pushing up 
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic 
growth 
samuel d kahan chief economist for kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said the reports sawtoothed 
performance tells you that there is not a boom building it 
suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters 
but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession 
the economy grew a robust 38 percent in 1988 but the slowest 
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the 
octoberdecember period when the increase in the gross national 
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent 
president bush plans to adopt his predecessors forecast that the 
economy will grow at a 32 percent rate in 1989 but many private 
economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming 
year

agriculture secretarydesignate clayton yeutter 
said today at his confirmation hearing that us agriculture is 
still far too dependent on taxpayers for its livelihood 
that is unhealthy and it is almost unsustainable in the long 
run secondly we have a major budgetary crunch on our hands he 
told the senate agriculture committee 
this country has a 150 billion budget deficit which will be 
reduced only through a combination of economic growth and spending 
discipline and the agriculture department budget cannot expect to 
escape the problem he said 
yeutter who served as president reagans trade representative 
spoke about his experience in opening worldwide markets to us 
products he noted as recent examples beef citrus and processed 
food exports to japan tobacco to several asian countries and 
almonds to india and europe 
but it is a whole lot more efficient less timeconsuming and 
less confrontational to do this multilaterally through trade 
negotiations he said that should be a high priority for the 
usda as well as for the us trade representative and it has 
implications for the 1990 farm bill 
we simply cannot rationally construct farm legislation for the 
90s until we know the outcome of the uruguay round of trade 
talks he said 
yeutter noted that president bush during his campaign said the 
1985 farm bill has done what it was expected to do in regard to farm 
income supports 
but american agriculture is changing constantly he told the 
committee and the institutional regime that is appropriate for 
today may well be inappropriate five years from now 
i will ask our usda professionals for a comprehensive 
evaluation of existing programs preparatory to submitting 
recommendations for policy adjustments in the future and we will 
obviously also seek the views of our agricultural community 
yeutter also said rural development will occupy a large portion 
of his time last years drought he said has led many in rural 
areas to contemplate their future and in so doing they have realized 
that they have become too dependent on agriculture 
they need to diversify their economic base he said adding 
that he would be working toward that goal 
the washington post reported meanwhile that yeutter was guest 
of honor at an inauguralweek reception costing thousands of dollars 
paid by the tobacco food and brewing conglomerate philip morris inc 
yeutter aggressively promoted american tobacco products overseas 
as us trade representative and agriculture secretary he would be 
responsible for policies directly affecting philip morris business 
interests 
yeutter did not check with government ethics officers before 
agreeing to the reception the post said 
executive branch ethics rules say an official cannot accept 
anything of value from anyone whose interests could be affected by 
the officials public duties 
roger bolton a spokesman for the trade office said that when 
the idea arose yeutter was planning to leave the government and the 
reception was viewed as a thank you for his efforts on behalf of 
the tobacco industry at large while he was us trade 
representative 
philip morris spokesman george knox said the company held the 
event for yeutter because it thought it would be nice and 
appropriate to celebrate the selection of an eminently qualified 
man as agriculture secretary 
donald e campbell deputy director of the office of government 
ethics told the post that yeutter should have checked with the 
trade offices ethics officer before agreeing to be feted by the 
company 
bolton said yeutter considered such approval unnecessary in 
light of his imminent departure from the trade office

1987 
during 1988 we made fundamental changes in the focus and 
structure of tenneco said james l ketelsen chairman and chief 
executive officer tenneco was the nations 10thlargest oil company 
before its 1988 sale 
ketelsen said the company used the proceeds of the oil and gas 
sale to repurchase more than 20 million shares of common stock for 
about 1 billion and reduce the companys debt by about 5 billion 
these changes combined with substantial divisional and 
corporate headquarters restructuring and cost reduction activity 
during 1988 have put tenneco in an excellent position to achieve 
significant improvements in operating results in 1989 ketelsen 
said 
the remaining assets of houstonbased tenneco include oil and gas 
pipelines farm and ranch equipment automotive parts shipbuilding 
packaging chemicals and minerals

a nonindian contractor seeking business 
reserved for indians on the navajo reservation in arizona told a 
senate committee today that he provided free airplane rides an 
unrepaid 35000 loan and other favors to the tribes chairman 
john a paddock said he originally offered to lend his 
construction companys plane and pilot to peter macdonald chairman 
of the nations largest indian tribe when macdonald was seeking 
reelection to his post in 1986 
he said macdonald used the plane for about 35 trips including 
many after his november 1986 election victory including two flights 
to las vegas 
paddocks construction company had been declared ineligible for 
jobs reserved for indians on the reservation by peterson zah who 
had ousted macdonald as chairman in 1982 
paddock said by supplying macdonald with the plane he hoped 
that wed be able to bid on contracts 
he told a special panel of the senate select committee on indian 
affairs that has been investigating corruption in programs designed 
for indians that the flights cost him 12000 in expenses for pilots 
and fuel the trips would have been worth about 60000 
commercially he said 
paddock also told the committee that in december 1987 macdonald 
asked him for a 35000 loan he said he couldnt refuse the request 
since as a contractor doing work on the reservation the tribe had 
his financial statements and i would have had a hard time telling 
him i was broke 
he said the loan which was to be for one year was never repaid 
paddock testified that he paid for many of the expenses for the 
trips to las vegas that he made with macdonald their wives and 
others 
he said he also lent a company car to macdonalds daughter hope 
and paid a 400 bill he received for use of the vehicles telephone 
he said he also paid 2500 for a birthday party for macdonalds 
wife wanda and was later reimbursed for half of the expenses of 
the party 
macdonald has denied he has acted improperly as leader of the 
navajo nation 
paddock testified that he set up a company called native american 
construction and engineering headed by a friend donald james who 
was a fullblooded navajo to allow us to bid on the preference 
work for indians 
on wednesday a former navy official convicted in the wedtech 
scandal told the senate investigative panel that a michigan company 
received multimilliondollar government contracts on the strength of 
a shaky claim to native american ownership 
richard ramirez former head of the navys small and 
disadvantaged business utilization program said he counseled 
companies seeking contracts under the small business 
administrations minority setaside program 
ramirez said kinross manufacturing co of michigan was an indian 
front company controlled by wealthy businessmen including some with 
connections to wedtech the bronx ny defense contractor whose 
top officials pleaded guilty to bribing government officials to get 
contracts 
ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection 
with the wedtech affair and is cooperating with the government in 
cases related to sba contractors 
the senate panel went into closed session wednesday to hear 
ramirez testimony which was then summarized in a statement 
released by the committee staff 
the statement did not identify the businessmen ramirez said had 
connections with both wedtech and kinross and committee staff would 
not elaborate 
ramirez said kinross installed a man named gerry blanchard as 
head of the company to win admittance to the minority program 
claiming he was an indian even though he was not enrolled in any 
indian tribe until 1982 
kinross received minority certification and then won 
multimilliondollar ammunition contracts ramirez said 
ramirez said he had never seen a startup company supported by so 
many government loans he claimed that kinross used influential 
political ties to gain sba approval 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the special panel 
said this weeks hearings into indian setasides have found problems 
common to the entire sba minority preference program 
the committee has discovered certain patterns of abuses common 
to kinross wedtech and other minority qualifying companies he 
said 
earlier in the day kraig kendall president of kampt homes inc 
in shawnee okla told the panel that the governments policy of 
requiring companies to have 51 percent indian ownership to win 
indianrelated contracts is an invitation for fraud and fronts 
kendall who served a prison term after pleading guilty in 1985 
to charges related to bribing a chickasaw tribe governor said 
contracting now is in a shambles 
he said that to participate in bidding for indianrelated 
government contracts he made an employees wife who had an indian 
relative in her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company 
he also said his practice of giving indian officials gifts 
ranging from dinner hams to automobiles was standard procedure among 
those seeking construction contracts on lands of the absentee 
shawnee and chickasaw tribes 
he said he was unable to obtain contracts legitimately and soon 
resorted to gifts gratuities and in some cases some serious 
bribes 
the committee began its hearings into corruption in indian 
affairs monday and has been concentrating on the front 
operations 
donald asbra chief of the contracting division of the bureau of 
indian affairs testified that the agency does not check 
contractors declarations that they are majority indianowned 
he said it is up to indians to police themselves and that they 
can complain to the bia if they believe business that is supposed to 
go to native americans is going to nonindians 
we dont have the capacity to inspect fronts said asbra

times were so tough for monika bogguess when she 
and her husband relocated to tucson ariz that she got a paper 
route and once sold blood to pay the bills 
since winning the states 135 million lottery jackpot last 
spring mrs bogguess 38 doesnt worry about making ends meet now 
she has a new set of financial problems how to invest a windfall 
when you dont know the difference between a stock certificate and a 
gift certificate 
i find it all very complicated said mrs bogguess who has 
since quit working as a newspaper carrier even though i used to 
deliver the wall street journal i dont know how to read it 
winning the lottery jackpot can be sweet dream but the 
temptations and mysteries of newfound wealth often become 
overwhelming 
many prize recipients such as mrs bogguess are plunged into the 
investment world blind theyre inundated with offers from financial 
brokers and a few fall prey to peddlers of bogus investments 
state lottery officials dont provide financial advice after all 
the hoopla dies down except to sometimes explain tax liabilities 
and urge winners to hire a good accountant 
the pressures of winning can be enormous said michael naste 
an independent financial planner from baldwin ny and a 25 
million lottery winner himself 
people label you a millionaire and expect you to live a certain 
way he said if youre not careful you can overextend yourself 
and end up in debt 
thats what happened to a construction worker who won 4 million 
in the new york lottery three years ago and became one of nastes 
three dozen jackpotwinning clients 
after receiving a check for around 148000 the first of 20 
annual aftertax installments the middleaged man quit his 
38000ayear job threw a party and put 10000 down on each of 10 
new cadillacs 
the only problem was he didnt realize he also needed money to 
live on for the year naste said 
in the next eight months six of the luxury cars were repossessed 
and the new york man had to borrow 200000 to hold him over in 
between lottery checks 
a lot of people who play the lottery are not used to having 
money so some of them do crazy things said naste 37 who puts 
most of his winnings in real estate youve got to remember youre 
not really a millionaire when you first win the money comes in over 
20 years 
people say if i win the lottery ill buy a baseball team 
theyve got to be kidding banks wont even loan you money based on 
future lottery winnings 
most biglottery winners though are fairly conservative 
according to interviews with winners financial advisers and 
officials among the 32 state lotteries nationwide 
michigan found in a survey two years ago that nearly three 
quarters of its 1 millionplus lottery winners had sought expert 
financial advice the majority used their first check to pay bills 
or splurge on a new home or car but later most made longterm 
investments saved for retirement or established trust funds the 
survey showed 
mrs bogguess and her husband david 42 are among those whom 
accountants might call conservative while she quit her job he kept 
working as a municipal sewagemanagement official in tucson where 
they moved three years ago from kansas 
the bogguess first 54000 lottery check nearly double their 
prelottery annual income was partly used to pay off some 
creditcard debts the 12000 family jeep and buy a new pickup 
truck mrs bogguess put the rest in a twoyear certificate of 
deposit and says shell commit at least 20000 a year to 
stillundetermined longterm investments 
im trying to invest it wisely i never had that much before 
and a couple of times i was down on hard times she said 
recalling the time she sold blood plasma to a local clinic for 30 a 
week 
john d flowers an assistant high school principal from 
barboursville wva has followed a similar playitsafe pattern 
after winning 2 million in the west virginia lottery in the spring 
of 1986 
flowers 40 who continues working but whose wife quit her job 
said most of his first lottery check went toward buying a new house 
on his accountants advice 10 percent was placed in a taxdeferred 
retirement annuity and another 10 percent was reserved for his three 
childrens college education 
a small amount was invested in mutual funds and shortterm 
taxfree municipal bonds flowers like some other lottery winners 
interviewed has avoided stocks 
this has raised our overall standard of living and lowered our 
overall worry level said flowers 
most prize recipients say their main goal is maintaining a higher 
living standard long after the lottery checks cease 
tax expert jane feola scaccetti who has counseled lottery 
winners says that can easily be done through diversified 
investments but her first advice is that clients take things slow 
its the same thing as with someone who inherits a lot of 
money said ms scaccetti a tax partner with the philadelphia 
accounting firm laventhol amp horwath you usually try to slow the 
pace down apply all the sound financial decison proccess as you 
would a wealthy individual who has earned money over a period of 
time 
for the first two years most lottery winners might want to keep 
the money in highyielding cds or treasury bills ms scaccetti 
said some banks such as northern trust co in chicago offer 
special accounts for clients who suddenly have 1 million or more 
and need a place to park it 
of course lottery winners also should be looking for ways to 
shelter themselves from taxes such as taxfree municipal bonds or 
annuities ms scaccetti said 
later on they need to ask themselves do i need to have a 
fixed return because i want to give up working or do i want to 
continue working and put a fixed income amount set aside she said 
dick zimmermann 39 a former abc news producer from the san 
francisco bay area fell in both categories after winning 976 
million in the california lottery a year ago 
although his annual net income of 500000 has kept himself and 
his wife out of the work force theyve been cautious 
zimmermann opted for investments most likely to appreciate like 
a new 425000 3bedroom house and a 1964 rolls royce silver cloud 
iii for tax reasons zimmermann obtained a 15year home mortgage 
rather than paying cash 
were trying to be good stewards of this money he said 
after all this sort of thing doesnt even come once in a 
lifetime your chances of being struck by lightning are four times 
better

mild weather and lean inventories helped big retailers ring up 
good sales in january and analysts said the gains reported today may 
have been larger if the stores had more merchandise to sell 
however analysts noted last months gains by the nations 
largest general retailers occurred during a month that typically is 
the least important on the industrys calendar 
moreover several store executives and analysts explained that at 
least part of the sales increase came in comparison with a 
relatively weak january 1988 
generally speaking the sales have come in very good for the 
month better i think than anyone would have expected observed 
jeffrey edelman of drexel burnham lambert inc in new york 
but edelman also said january is such an insignificant month 
januarys a cleanup month after christmas if you had a couple of 
good days that makes a big difference 
unseasonably warm weather over much of the country in january 
probably encouraged shoppers and added to sales volumes during some 
years past severe winter conditions have kept consumers from 
venturing out to stores 
monroe greenstein of the investment firm bear stearns said the 
tight inventories likely depressed january sales one leading 
department store chain informed him that it had to scramble to 
locate merchandise to stock stores during january 
i believe if there was more inventory sales would have been 
better said greenstein 
goods were sharply depleted during december when business was 
even better than retailers had expected also stores didnt have 
much left over after christmas because they already had been holding 
inventories down to avoid having to slash prices to move unsold 
merchandise later 
retailers adopted the strategy after two years of sluggish sales 
in which consumers devoted more of their discretionary income to 
necessities and services and tried to reduce their high debt levels 
analysts and economists expect this trend to continue this year 
retail sales are closely watched for indications of overall 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of the countrys 
overall economic activity 
the figures today indicated the industry had about 65 percent 
growth in sales last year and analysts predicted a gain of about 55 
percent to 6 percent for this year 
the nations largest retailer sears roebuck and co said its 
overall sales rose 114 percent in the four weeks ended jan 28 to 
213 billion from 191 billion a year earlier fullyear sales 
went up 73 percent to 3242 billion from 3021 billion sears 
samestore sales sales in stores open more than a year rose 62 
percent in january and 34 percent for the entire year 
k mart corp said its overall sales last month and rose 69 
percent to 158 billion from 148 billion fullyear sales rose 
65 percent to 273 billion from 1987s 2563 billion k marts 
samestore sales increased for the month 25 percent and 28 percent 
for the year 
walmart stores inc said its overall sales rose 30 percent 
during january to 149 billion from 114 billion fullyear sales 
in the year ended jan 31 were up 29 percent to 2065 billion from 
1596 billion the discount retailers samestore sales rose 13 
percent for the month and 12 percent for the year 
jc penney co inc said sales rose 24 percent to 738 million 
in the latest four weeks from 721 million the entire years sales 
came to 1397 billion down 01 percent from 1398 billion 
the results reported were from the biggest general merchandise 
and apparel retailers unlike monthly retail sales figures released 
by the federal government they do not include sales at auto 
dealers supermarkets or restaurants

president bush stressing a message of 
continuity amid change assured japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita today that relations are strong and any differences 
between the two economic powers are the differences of friends 
we respect one another we need one another we will continue 
to work together bush said as he bade farewell to takeshita the 
first foreign leader to visit the new president in the white house 
takeshita responded to bushs comments with similar warm words 
telling him i look to you mr president for wise and good 
leadership and you will have my full support hand in hand 
there is nothing we cannot achieve 
following more than two hours of talks that included a working 
lunch in the private quarters bush and the prime minister emerged 
to read statements in their respective languages at the diplomatic 
entrance 
both men pledged to work to alleviate irritants that have marked 
the fourdecade alliance particularly in internationl relations 
trade and military cooperation 
the president said japan can rely on the united states which has 
borne the major burden of that nations defense since world war ii 
some members of congress have called upon japan now a world 
economic leader to increase its defense spending 
we will continue to shoulder the obligations that belong to a 
global power bush pledged 
continuity will also be the mark of relations between the 
united states and japan on occasion we may have differences but 
these are the differences of friends the president added 
bush also applauded japans efforts to increase its aid to third 
world nations many in japan hold such spending to be an alternative 
to military spending particularly in light of their nations 
constitution which limits the nations military to a defensive 
posture 
the president also pledged to work toward bringing the two 
nations economies into better balance and said he was 
determined to reduce the us budget deficit 
while many in the united states have criticized japan for failing 
to open markets to us goods thereby contributing to the more than 
50 billion trade imbalance the japanese have repeatedly criticized 
the us deficit as a cause of the deficit 
takeshita called the military alliance firm and sound 
the prime minister pledged to continue efforts to restructure his 
economy a means to open the nation to freer trade 
assistant secretary of state gaston sigur the state departments 
specialist on the far east said after the session that the meeting 
was not designed to deal with very specific issues and that it 
was geared toward allowing bush and takeshita a chance to know 
each other better 
sigur noted that while the two leaders did not discuss a 
controversial new joint usjapanese jet fighter project that has 
come under attack in congress secretary of state james a baker iii 
told japans foreign minister sousuke uno that the project was under 
review by the administration 
earlier koichi haraguchi a japanese spokesman told reporters 
he hoped the bush adminstration would support the project 
the agreement under which general dynamics of the united states 
and japans mitsubishi heavy industry would joint forces to build 
socalled fsx jet fighters was negotiated late in the reagan 
administration 
critics in congress have labeled the project an 8 billion 
giveway of us high technology and have called on bush to review 
the agreement the japanese government says it needs a final 
goahead from the united states on the project by march 31 to get 
funds for the project into its current budget 
haraguchi told reporters that to go backward by scrapping the 
project would be against the interests of both japan and the 
united states 
bush is scheduled to travel to japan later this month for the 
funeral of emperor hirohito but a us official who asked not to be 
identified said todays meeting was timely because talks on such 
matters as defense the international economy and japans trade 
surplus would be difficult amid ceremonies for the late emperor 
its very important for the two leaders to meet early on to 
establish a personal rapport and a broadbrush agenda the 
official said 
one irritant arose recently when secretary of defensedesignate 
john tower suggested during his confirmation hearings that japans 
contributions to its own defense are inadequate tower criticized 
the nations constitution as a lousy idea 
the 1946 constitution adopted during the postworld war ii us 
occupation limits japan to a defensive military posture 
towers comments brought a sharp rebuke from the japanese who 
pointed to a new budget that calls for a 59 percent increase in 
military spending 
the senior administration official pointed out that japan is 
spending 25 billion to support us troops stationed there he 
acknowledged that the united states would like to see a lot of 
these things increased but said the administration was pleased 
japan is moving in the right direction

while many prominent texas business people 
are short on cash and long on debt entrepreneur clayton w williams 
jr says hes debtfree for the first time in 10 years and may even 
run for governor 
williams founder of claydesta communications recently agreed to 
merge the longdistance company with 55000 customers into 
atlantabased advanced telecommunications corp the deal will pay 
him 33 million in cash and 10 million in advanced 
telecommunications stock 
ive battled back like a lot of people in texas and emerged 
with a good financial statement he said in an interview in his 
hometown of midland center of the depressed texas energy industry 
its not as good as it once was but its better than a lot of 
peoples 
the move will erase the remainder of what once totaled almost 
half a billion dollars in debt spread among more than 20 companies 
owned by williams including more than 45 million incurred to start 
claydesta communications 
williams says that after he closes the merger deal he will owe 
virtually nothing 
its no accident hes paying off debt while the rest of the state 
suffers effects of the economic catastrophe williams calls the 
wreck said the 57yearold oilman with holdings in real estate 
ranching banking and farming 
the dizzying collapse of the southwest oil and real estate 
empires in recent years has produced a list of prominent victims 
that reads like a whos who of texas tycoons it includes former 
gov john connally the hunt brothers industrialist t cullen davis 
and dallas cowboys owner bum bright 
williams is unusual because he isnt on the list keeping ahead 
of the economic tide is one of his specialties even his bank 
claydesta national is making money in a state where troubled banks 
have become a fact of daily life 
although he denied political aspirations a few months ago 
williams said in january after he returned from a twoweek pakistan 
safari that he was considering a run for the governors office on 
the republican ticket he has said his annual exotic hunting forays 
often provide him inspiration 
it was on another such trip this one to the yukon in 1981 that 
williams decided it was time to get out of the oil and gas business 
no matter how much it hurt his pride 
when the time came i said clay youre not such a big deal 
you better retrench consolidate sell he recalls 
his formula for walking away largely unharmed by the wreck cut 
your losses and if it doesnt work unload it 
we worked like hell going up and then when the wreck came we 
worked like hell going down to keep from going broke while 
everything fell apart he said 
in more than 30 years of doing business in texas williams mostly 
thought only of growth and expansion now he said my direction 
is tied to bottom line cash flow efficiency 
while paring down helped him survive williams struggled to 
nurture his longdistance company started in the aftermath of the 
breakup of the american telephone amp telegraph co monopoly 
a lot of things happened to this company that happened to 
texas williams said wed sign up people as customers and a 
year later theyd be broke they wouldnt even exist anymore 
companies that had 1000 employees would have 100 or 200 
despite hostile economics claydesta communications grew from 
five employees to 370 in one year its projecting revenues of 63 
million for 1988 up from 3 million in revenues in 1984 the year 
the company was started 
then williams said his oil brought close to 30 a barrel and 
natural gas 3 per cubic foot with todays prices a fraction of 
that money to fund a fastgrowing company wasnt available 
we werent able to grow and realize the potential of our market 
and our employees because i wasnt able to put more money and more 
money into it on 12 oil he said 
after studying a merger for the communications company for about 
a year williams decided advanced telecommunications with more than 
150000 customers and 168 million in revenues would be a good fit 
williams has never been a fan of atampt and once grabbed headlines 
by leading a mounted posse up the steps of the capitol to protest 
the proposed deregulation of the telephone giant 
ironically he found himself in the unfamilar telecommunications 
business after problems getting phone service for a tenant spawned 
plans for his own phone company the digital and fiber optic network 
he built will continue to form the basis for claydesta 
communications under the new company 
claydesta will retain its name management and employees under 
the merger williams featured in the companys westernthemed 
commercials will sit on advanced telecommunications board and 
serve as claydestas spokesman 
with responsibility for the phone companys growth and management 
now shared williams is looking to bolster other ventures his 
cattle operation in alpine southwest texas is his most profitable 
business he said 
given the depressed real estate market and further cutbacks in 
the energy sector williams said he plans to be a bargain hunter 
the oil business is still sick which means there could be 
opportunities because of the wreck for a small efficient 
operator he said 
evercheerful williams is optimistic about discovering hidden 
profit in unfamiliar businesses 
its like being an old hunting dog looking for birds he 
said if you get out there and get to hunting youll find some 
birds but youve got to get out there first

chevron usa inc has announced a 
potentially significant discovery of natural gas in the gulf of 
mexico about 25 to 30 miles south of this florida panhandle resort 
community 
if additional drilling confirms a commerical discovery it would 
be the first in gulf waters off the panhandle 
oil companies have been drilling exploratory wells in the area 
since the early 1970s but never have found profitable amounts of gas 
or oil 
the chevron well is in a block the company leased jointly with 
conoco inc who will take over work at the site including the 
drilling of a second exploratory well said chevron spokesman 
johathan lifa 
the new well is to be drilled this summer or early fall 
we cant tell from this first well by itself if we have the 
kind of reserves we need to support a commercial operation conoco 
spokesman michael oconnor said wednesday but i think its fair 
to say this is encouraging we simply have to see what the potential 
is 
lifa said it may be five years or more before a decision is made 
whether to produce gas from the field 
if so it could be an economic boost for the panhandle in the 
form of onshore support and supply facilities said mike zeigler of 
the west florida regional planning council 
most onshore support operations for exploratory drilling in the 
region have been based in panama city he said 
core samples from chevrons exploratory well and seismic tests 
indicated the presence of gas in a formation called norphlet 
sandstone lifa said 
large gas fields in lower mobile bay in alabama about 50 miles 
west of the new find are in the same kind of formation 
the chevron well is in 180 feet of water and was drilled to a 
depth of 22572 feet 
last april the interior department described the chevron well 
and an amoco well south of fort walton beach as being capable of 
producing paying quantities but at that time the companies said 
they were still studying the drilling results 
conoco and chevron were among major buyers when the government 
offered new leases at nearby sites in the gulf last november

crude futures prices rallied after sliding most 
of the day thursday fueled by a report that an opec country would 
cut production if necessary to stabilize prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil closed 22 
cents higher at 1773 a barrel after falling to 1738 earlier in 
the session the contract had risen 48 cents on wednesday to 1751 
a barrel 
other contract months were mixed 
according to market observers the report published in an 
arabiclanguage newspaper said dubai the largest producing emirate 
within the united arab emirates was willing to cut its output 10 
percent after march 1 if market conditions warrant 
it was psychological said jayne ball commodity oil broker 
with dean witter reynolds inc ten percent only amounts to 40000 
barrels a day the main thing is dubai had said previously it 
would not cut back at all 
world oil prices had risen rapidly since november surprising 
many analysts but in recent days began easing slightly mainly on 
technical factors 
investors interpreted thursdays news as another sign that the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries is trying to stabilize 
prices analysts said 
the united arab emirates is one of the opec countries believed to 
be exceeding a new production quota established by the 13member 
cartel to reduce output and stabilize world oil prices the quota of 
185 million barrels a day took effect jan 1 but various estimates 
since then put opecs actual production at between 195 million and 
20 million barrels 
some reports have suggested the uae is exceeding its quota by 
some 400000 barrels a day 
traders said prices also got some support from venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez who during his inauguration on 
thursday called for more cooperation by opec and nonopec countries 
among refined oil products the march contract for unleaded 
gasoline lost 01 cent to close at 4962 cents a gallon while the 
march contract for heating oil rose 011 cent to 5055 cents a

universal foods corp executives testified 
thursday that they had not thoroughly examined a pair of 
halfbilliondollar takeover bids by high voltage engineering corp 
before rejecting them two months ago 
universal chairman john l murray and president guy a osborn 
were the first two witnesses called in a us district court hearing 
over a lawsuit filed by amanda acquisition corp a subsidiary 
formed by high voltage engineering of burlington mass 
amanda is challenging universals poison pill defense and 
wisconsins antitakeover law which have blocked its takeover bid 
that began in december 
osborn testified that universals management and the board of 
directors did not feel an analysis on the adequacy of amandas two 
bids submitted in december was necessary before the board voted on 
the matters 
based on the bright future prospects of the company we 
determined it was inadequate osborn said 
amanda on dec 1 offered 3050 a share for universal which 
valued the company at 508 million on the basis of universals 167 
million shares it raised its bid two weeks later to 35 a share or 
585 million amanda already owns 614500 shares 
both offers have been rejected by universals board and 
management has threatened to enforce its poison pill if amanda 
continues to press its bid 
sampw berisford plc a british food conglomerate is the major 
backer of amandas bid according to court documents it is 
providing 195 million 
chase manhattan bank and investor bankers kidder peabody amp co 
would provide the rest of the estimated 643 million amanda says it 
would need to close the deal including investment banking fees 
under questioning from amanda attorney greg joseph osborn and 
murray both confirmed that the companys directors before they 
voted on amandas offer did not seek 
an analysis of what would be a fair offer for the company 
a determination of what the future value of the company would be 
opinions from its investment bankers on the adequacy of the 
amanda bid 
any meetings to elicit more information on the history plans 
and financing of amanda 
frankly the company is on a roll and this simply is not the 
time to be selling the company you only get to sell the company 
once murray said 
in his opening arguments amanda lawyer william levitt said he 
hoped to show that universals management recklessly pursued a 
justsayno approach to purchase offers and had rejected 
amandas offers even before they had received any information 
amanda announced thursday it extended the expiration date of its 
35 cash tender offer for universals common stock through feb 13 
it also said it had no immediate plans to acquire any shares as a 
result of the offer pending a decision in the court suit

for the full year chrysler had a profit of 105 billion or 
466 cents a share down 186 percent from 129 billion or 590 
a share in 1987 annual revenue rose to 355 billion from 293 
billion the previous year 
the 1988 results were reduced by 931 million due to a 150 
million charge for previously announced plant closings in chryslers 
acustar parts subsidiary 
iacocca said annual results also were affected by the companys 
strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and 
offering sales incentives 
chryslers share of the us car and truck market rose to 14 
percent from 123 percent in 1987 the share for cars increased to 
113 percent from 108 percent while the share for trucks was 194 
percent up from 183 percent in 1987 
iacocca also said hourly and salaried workers would receive 
profitsharing payments averaging about 720 in march the payments 
would be the companys first under a profitsharing agreement signed 
last year with the united auto workers 
general motors corp late last year announced profitsharing of 
about 200 per employee officials at no 2 ford motor co are 
expected to announce profitsharing well over 1000 per worker 
chrysler said it sold 221 million vehicles the first time it 
sold a million cars and a million trucks in the same year compared 
with 192 million in 1987 
chrysler financial corp the automakers financing arm reported 
a fourth quarter profit of 74 million up from 60 million a year 
earlier for the full year chrysler financial had a profit of 259 
million up from 226 million in 1987 
automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the 
industrys best earnings year ever with the big three posting 
combined profits of 11 billion the previous record was the 
combined 98 billion profit in 1984 
general motors corp and ford motor co are expected to release 
their yearend earning figures in midfebruary 
iacocca also renewed his argument for the us treasury 
department should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks 
including minivans and sportutility vehicles some foreign 
automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars such 
as the popular minivans and thereby have to pay only a 25 percent 
tariff 
iacocca gm chairman roger b smith and ford chairman donald 
peterson have called on the treasury to slap the truck tariff on 
lightutility vehicles 
if it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a 
truck then its a truck iacocca said

popeyes fried chicken and biscuits owner al 
copeland on thursday extended his 8ashare offer to churchs fried 
chicken shareholders this time pushing the expiration date to feb 
19 
the move comes two days after copelands latest court victory on 
tuesday the 5th us circuit court of appeals refused to reconsider 
an earlier decision allowing copeland to go ahead with the bid 
another court decision over the takeover is pending in a san 
antonio federal court 
the feb 19 date is significant because churchs has said it 
anticipates finishing an auction of the company by then 
a copeland enterprises inc popeyes corporate parent said 
thursday it now has been offered about 77 million shares of 
churchs or about 25 percent of the outstanding shares 
thats down from almost 45 percent company spokesman mark 
mckinnon said the drop could be attributed to several reasons 
including the decision by churchs to put the company up for auction 
and the fact that an extension of the deadline was expected 
we still expect those tenders to come forward he said

orange juice futures prices turned decisively lower thursday 
erasing nearly twothirds of the past weeks gains as fears of 
frost damage to the florida orange groves melted away 
on other markets precious metals futures resumed their slide 
after a 1day interruption grains and soybeans moved lower energy 
futures and livestock futures were mixed 
frozen concentrated orange juice settled 36 cents to 44 cents 
lower on the new york cotton exchange with the contract for delivery 
in march at 1385 a pound 
the march contract had gained 74 cents boosting the contracts 
value by 1110 during the four previous sessions on concerns that 
an arctic cold front howling down from alaska would spread freezing 
temperatures all the way to tampa 
but now that the big chill has reached the nations heartland 
meteorologists are predicting that its impact on floridas climate 
will be less than severe 
the reality is that the florida weather is only supposed to 
drop into the mid40s and that is absolutely nowhere near 
freezing said judith ganes a market analyst with shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
another reality is that 45 percent of the 198889 florida orange 
crop has already been picked leaving only a portion of the fruit 
vulnerable even if temperatures did fall below 32 degrees she said 
further selling was linked to the dollars gains against other 
currencies effectively raising prices to european dealers for 
brazilian orange juice which is quoted in us dollars the higher 
prices could squeeze demand 
the dollars strength also contributed to moderate declines in 
gold and silver futures prices which tend to move in tandem with 
foreign currency values 
some analysts noted a reluctance among traders to buy gold 
futures ahead of fridays meeting in washington of the finance 
ministers of the seven major industrialized western nations 
the precious metals staged a modest rally on wednesday after four 
days of sharp losses but thursdays selloff offset nearly all of 
golds gains and about onethird of silvers 
gold settled 110 to 140 lower with february at 39230 a troy 
ounce silver was 12 cents lower across the board with march at 
5863 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices continued to slump on the 
chicago board of trade extending the previous sessions losses amid 
disappointment over slack export sales and precipitation in growing 
areas 
new snow in the northern plains and the corn belt will add 
badlyneeded moisture to the soil improving the prospects for a 
good growing season 
meanwhile rain fell overnight in brazil and argentina the 
largest soybeanproducing countries in south america giving crops 
there a boost 
wheat settled 4 cents lower to 1 cents higher with march at 
427 a bushel corn was cent to 3 cents lower with march at 
273 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with march at 
216 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 10 cents lower with march 
at 764 a bushel 
crudeoil futures prices advanced modestly while refined products 
ended narrowly mixed in choppy trading on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
crude prices surged at midday on reports that dubai had cut its 
production of crude oil by 10 percent 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 22 cents 
higher with march at 1773 a barrel heating oil was 11 cent to 
25 cent higher with march at 5055 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was unchanged to 25 cent lower with march at 4962 cents a 
gallon 
signs of sluggish demand pressured most cattle and pork futures 
on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle settled 28 cent lower to 10 cent higher with 
february at 7507 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 10 
cent lower with march at 8467 cents a pound live hogs were 17

a majority of us corporate controllers 
believe leveraged buyouts have a negative impact on the economy in 
a sharp turnaround from a similar survey two years ago the national 
association of accountants said thursday 
of about 1000 members of the trade group responding to a survey 
taken in the first week of january 84 percent said leveraged 
buyouts do not contribute positively to the economy that contrasted 
with february 1987 survey where only 47 percent of the respondents 
criticized the buyouts 
the change seems to reflect disapproval of two or three recent 
large buyouts said earnest a huband president of the 
montvalebased accountants association 
in a leveraged buyout a purchaser uses the assets of a target 
company to finance debts used to acquire the company the tactic has 
become increasingly popular in recent years as reflected by last 
years record 245 billion buyout of rjr nabisco inc by the firm 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
critics contend the huge amounts of debt loaded on to the target 
companies make them especially vulnerable to failure during an 
economic downturn 
of those responding to the survey 60 percent indicated they 
would like to see greater federal regulation of leveraged buyouts 
that compared with 58 percent who were against greater federal 
regulation of lbos in a survey conducted last may 
of those supporting greater regulation 45 percent said the best 
way would be to eliminate the tax deduction for interest on 
leveraged buyout financing and 40 percent indicated the securities 
and exchange commission should to take action only 15 percent 
indicated the justice department should become involved

deciding a dispute that has split the biggest 
networks and tv makers a standardsetting body thursday rejected an 
appeal over the standard for producing highdefinition television 
and movies 
the standards decision removes lingering doubts about what kinds 
of cameras tape recorders and other equipment will be used to 
produce the coming generation of sharp bright tv pictures 
the market for highdefinition television including production 
equipment and receivers is expected to reach tens of billions of 
dollars a year by early in the coming century 
the appeals board of the nonprofit american national standards 
institute which has final say on thursday voted to turn down an 
appeal led by capital citiesabc inc which said the decision on a 
standard was made without adequate consensus of interested parties 
the boards action means that the new standard is the one 
proposed by the society of motion picture and television engineers 
the standard prescribes 1125 horizontal lines per screen more 
than twice as many as the 525 lines per screen on todays 
televisions permitting far superior pictures however if the 
transmission standard is not as sophisticated as the production 
standard some of the extra clarity will be lost a decision on a 
broadcast standard which involves the public airwaves will be made 
eventually by the federal communications commission 
the standard matches the japanese one in having 1125 lines per 
screen but it calls for 60 frames per second compared to 5994 
frames per second in the japanese standard 
the nowofficial standard ratifies what exists in most of the 
highdefinition television production equipment that is already in 
use but to opponents it threatens to shut off inventiveness while 
the industry is still young 
were disappointed in the outcome abc spokesman bob mackin 
said 
mackin said the abcled group hoped that the society of motion 
picture and television engineers would consider accepting additional 
production standards as they are developed 
adoption of any additional standards would depend on the review 
of a committee of the engineers society peter gartland the 
organizations chief counsel said in an interview smpte does not 
have a policy against coming up with additional standards he said 
supporting the society of motion picture and television engineers 
were such companies as cbs inc hbo inc the motion picture 
association of america matsushita electric industrial ltds 
panasonic co and a major group of broadcast industry unions the 
department of professional employees aflcio 
on the other side capitalcities abc was supported by general

two leaders of the house banking committee on 
thursday blamed federal sampl regulators for the failure of private 
auditors to uncover problems in institutions that later failed 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas the chairman of the panel and 
rep frank annunzio dill a subcommittee chairman also 
complained about an institutionalized revolving door where major 
accounting firms assign employees to the federal home loan bank 
board as fellows the accountants on loan provide advice to the 
bank board before returning to their firms the legislators said 
the statement by the two accompanied a longawaited report from 
the general accounting office that turned up six instances in which 
independent accounting firms did not adequately audit 
institutions that later failed 
the gao congress auditing and investigative agency said it had 
found auditing and reporting problems significant enough in 
six cases to warrant our referring the cpa firms performing the 
audits to regulatory and professional bodies for their review 
it named five firms jk byrne amp co subsequently acquired by 
touche ross co deloitte haskins sells ernst whinney 
greenstein logan amp co and arthur young amp co 
aruthur young audited two institutions that later became two of 
the biggest insolvencies in texas requiring billions of dollars 
from the federal sampl insurance fund vernon savings and loan 
association and western savings association gonzalez and annunzio 
said arthur young received nearly 1 million in fees from the two 
sampls 
the two said they were appalled that the bank board did 
not step in years earlier to demand reform of auditing procedures 
and performance they said they would conduct hearings on the 
matter 
m danny wall chairman of the bank board said last week that 
his agency is vigorously pursuing accounting firms that may have 
contributed to failures 
bank board spokesman william fulwider said the agency has civil 
suits against 11 firms including three of the socalled big 
eight and other investigations are underway and could lead to 
additional suits

the illinois supreme court cleared the 
way thursday for criminal prosecution of five factory officials 
whose employees contend they were injured by a toxic cocktail 
and other unsafe working conditions 
without dissent the states highest court ruled that the federal 
occupational safety and health act does not bar criminal prosecution 
for unsafe working conditions 
a cook county grand jury indicted the five officials of chicago 
magnet wire co in 1984 on charges of aggravated battery reckless 
conduct and conspiracy however a circuit judge dismissed the 
indictments a year later ruling they were preempted by federal law 
the indictment charged that 42 workers suffered nerve and lung 
disorders scars from metals and other problems as a result of their 
working conditions 
prosecutors said the factory lacked safety equipment proper 
cooling and ventilation and that workers were exposed to what a 
doctor who examined them called a toxic cocktail of hazardous 
chemicals they said accounts of conditions at the suburban chicago 
factory where wire was coated with polyvinyl chloride and other 
chemicals resemble a historical narrative about conditions in the 
sweat shops of the mid19th century 
the case drew the attention of business groups from across the 
nation as well as county prosecutors from boston new york and los 
angeles who sought to try similar cases in their areas 
the supreme courts ruling which sets a precedent is of 
national importance said cook county states attorney richard m 
daley whose office investigated the case it will help safegaurd 
the workers of illinois from deliberate harm at the hands of a very 
few unscrupulous employers who put profits above the safety of their 
workers 
business leaders warned that thursdays decision could lead to a 
patchwork of safety standards varying among counties and states 
with executives facing criminal sanctions if their factories failed 
to pass muster 
what can an employer do to forsee all of these circumstances 
with the possibility that he may be hauled before the grand jury and 
indicted said arthur gottschalk president of the illinois 
manufacturers association 
but daley said only a very few unscrupulous employers would 
have anything to worry about 
the evidence we uncovered showed that the defendants knew of 
the dangers did nothing to protect their employees and in fact 
concealed the danger to the workforce he said at a news 
conference 
this alleged conduct went beyond the issues regulated by osha 
and can only be addressed properly in the criminal courts daley 
said 
thursdays ruling also set a possible precedent for another 
illinois case in which three executives of film recovery systems 
inc a suburban chicago company were convicted of murder and 
sentenced to prison in the death of a factory worker who was exposed 
to cyanide on the job 
that case currently on appeal was the first in us history in 
which corporate executives were convicted of murder in a 
safetyrelated workplace death 
in their opinion thursday the illinois justices noted that the 
us supreme court decided a similar preemption question in 
upholding a punitive damage award to the estate of karen silkwood 
the kerrmcgee corp worker whose death brought national attention 
to safety concerns in the nuclear industry 
it is totally unreasonable to conclude that congress intended 
that oshas penalties would be the only sanctions available for 
wrongful conduct which threatens or results in serious physical 
injury or death to workers justice daniel p ward wrote for the 
court 
harvey silets a attorney for one of the defendants has 
predicted that the case ultimately will go to the us supreme 
court he and other defense lawyers did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment on thursdays decision

a federal judge began hearing testimony 
thursday on a request by pennwalt corp to block a stockholders 
meeting centaur partners has demanded in its 765 million hostile 
bid for pennwalt 
centaur which owns about 13 percent of pennwalts stock hopes 
to use the meeting to replace the chemical companys board with 
directors sympathetic to its offer 
in issuing the demand tuesday centaur delivered proxies that it 
said represented owners of approximately 346 percent of pennwalts 
outstanding shares 
state law requires a company to hold any meeting requested by 
stockholders with at least 20 percent of the firms shares 
centaur whose principals are new york financiers abbey j butler 
and melvyn j estrin launched the 100ashare bid in middecember 
pennwalts stock closed unchanged thursday at 10562 on the new 
york stock exchange 
pennwalt claims centaur included inadequate disclosure in the 
tender offer would be short at least 57 million to finance the 
merger and failed to reveal that butler filed for personal 
bankruptcy six years ago and was accused of fraud in 1979 
attorney matthew broderick representing pennwalt alleged in a 
legal brief that pennwalt would suffer irreparable harm without a 
temporary injunction to stop the meeting 
the court should recognize that the public interest is not 
served by permitting a takeover developed through misleading public 
statements to come to fruition the brief said 
bruce kauffman the lawyer for centaur and attorney stuart 
savett speaking for a group of stockholders disagreed and insisted 
the only issue was whether a stockholders meeting should be held 
we are not concerned with whether this is a good offer a fair 
offer or a bad offer but whether there has been full disclosure 
kaufman told us district judge robert gawthrop it is up to the 
shareholders to decide about the offer 
savett also said the stockholders should be allowed to meet 
quickly and make the decision 
in his brief kauffman said centaur has disclosed all material 
information with respect to the financing of the offer as required 
under the federal securities laws 
broderick called butler as a hostile witness and brought out that 
he had filed for personal bankruptcy in 1983 reporting debts of 
more than 1 million and assets of about 3500 
a court document also disclosed that in 1979 in california 
butler and others were accused of fraudulent stock transfers 
totaling nearly 400000 
butler said there was never any adjudication of the charges 
in a related development pennwalt dropped a lawsuit against 
painewebber inc which has agreed to provide 400 million in 
shortterm financing for the takeover 
the lawsuit contended the tender offer violated federal 
securities laws by containing misleading statements
