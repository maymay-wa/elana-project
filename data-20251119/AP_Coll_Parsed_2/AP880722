a former employee of a sunnyvale defense 
contractor was ordered friday to stand trial for the shooting 
deaths of seven people during a 5hour rampage at the plant in 
february 
richard wade farley 39 a onetime software engineer at esl 
inc was scheduled to be arraigned aug 2 in superior court no 
trial date has been set 
santa clara county municipal court judge edwin pearce ordered a 
trial for farley at a preliminary hearing following nearly two 
weeks of testimony from police and esl employees who were present 
the day of the feb 16 massacre 
police say that farley burst into the esl plant feb 16 loaded 
down with weapons and fired at least 100 rounds killing seven 
people and wounding three including a former coworker who had 
spurned his romantic advances 
also friday prosecutor alan nudelman said he was adding three 
charges of attempted murder and reducing one attemptedmurder 
charge to assault with a deadly weapon 
with those changes farley would face seven counts of murder and 
five of attempted murder as well as charges of burglary vandalism 
and assault with a deadly weapon 
the additional charges follow the testimony of esl employees 
randall hemingway karen mackey and william drake that farley shot 
at them and missed during the siege 
the reduced charge relates to the shooting of esl engineer laura 
black whose rejections of farleys repeated advances were cited as 
the reason for the rampage last week a tape was played of 
farleys conversation with police the night of the siege in which 
he said that he wanted black to survive the attack so she would 
live with regret that she had rejected him 
i am convinced it was not his intent to kill laura black 
nudelman said that would have defeated his purpose 
nudelman said he decided not to ask black to testify at the 
hearing because farley is an emotional rapist who would have 
derived satisfaction from seeing her on the witness stand but he 
said he would most assuredly seek her testimony at his trial 
farley had been fired from the plant in 1986 in part for 
harassing black she eventually obtained a judges ruling shortly 
before the shootings ordering farley to stay away from her 
esl develops computer programs for various department of defense 
projects

a newspaper said saturday that rescuers have 
pulled 10 bodies from a southwest china river after a boat 
capsized but authorities were still not sure how many more are 
missing 
the overseas edition of the official peoples daily said 
saturday that 10 bodies had been found and 148 people had been 
rescued from the fastmoving waters of the min river a tributary 
of the yangtze in sichuan province 
the daily said 16 of the rescued had been hospitalized 
the official xinhua news agency in a report late friday said 152 
people had been rescued after the boat hit a rock and sank 
it was not known if any foreigners were on the boat 
xinhua reported thursday that 250 people were on the boat but 
local officials said by telephone friday the exact number of 
passengers was not known because the boat made frequent stops 
another report in the peasant daily said the boat was carrying 
its capacity of 324 
tang langmin an official of the chongqing shipping co owners 
of the vessel told the associated press that there are still no 
accurate estimates of those on board 
tang said the cause of the accident is still not clear although 
earlier reports said the boat hit a rock 
he said it is unlikely that there were any foreigners aboard 
because the area is still closed to foreign visitors 
among those rescued were 16 crew members china news service 
said it said six people required hospitalization but did not give 
details of their injuries 
the report quoted sichuan officials as saying rescue work was 
difficult because the accident occurred in a remote area and the 
river level was high 
the boat sank in qianwei county about 116 miles south of the 
provincial capital of chengdu 
xinhua said an investigation was under way 
sichuan gov zhang haoru and vice gov ma lin went to the scene

recent rains in the nations midsection 
have raised the waters of the ohio river enough to clear a logjam 
of barge traffic that has existed for weeks the coast guard said 
friday 
the ohio river like the mississippi and missouri had shrunk to 
alltime lows earlier this month at one point 84 barge tows were 
backed up on the ohio near this southern illinois town a few miles 
north of the the point where the ohio meets the mississippi 
but by friday evening all backedup barges had cleared the area 
and all size restrictions on the tows were lifted said coast guard 
ensign rick johnson 
upriver at louisville the ohio averaged 5 billion gallons of 
water a day during the first half of the month 84 percent below 
normal the us geological survey said 
the current flow rate wasnt available friday but during one 
24hour period this week the river rose 5 feet johnson said the 
river stage at cairo was 61 feet tuesday and 1269 feet friday he 
said 
however the coast guard continued to rout traffic one way at a 
time through an auxiliary channel near mound city while a dredge 
scooped out silt from the main route 
it still has a lot of work to do in the area johnson said 
the question of whether barge traffic continues to flow freely 
will be answered by the amount of rainfall he added 
i dont know how long it will stay this way johnson said 
if we get a dry spell like weve been having the river will go 
right back down and well be back where we were

republicans say they plan to begin a 
challenge possibly as early as today in an effort to keep lloyd 
bentsens hands off his senate campaign kitty now that he also is 
officially the democratic nominee for vice president 
although bentsens two races are legal in texas the dual 
candidacies are unprecedented since presidential campaigns became 
publicly financed in 1976 and the national republican senatorial 
committee plans to mount a challenge 
republicans contend bentsen nominated as democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis running mate thursday night 
in atlanta should be barred from spending his senate contributions 
because they also will benefit the democratic presidential 
campaign which is limited to spending 46 million in public funds 
were going to sit back and go to school on how these guys 
bend break and mutilate the spending limits in the presidential 
election said ben ginsberg legal counsel to the committee 
bentsen who has a reputation for being one of the most 
successful fundraisers in congress raised 61 million from jan 
1 1987 to june 30 of this year while his republican challenger 
in his senate race rep beau boulter has collected 587254 
during the period according to the federal election commission 
ginsberg said the group tentatively planned to file a petition 
with the fec today seeking to block certification of 
dukakisbentsen ticket so the team cant receive public campaign 
money the petition is the first step to challenging bentsens use 
of his senate campaign funds ginsberg said 
texas with its 29 electoral votes will be a prime battleground 
in the race for president between dukakis and the certain 
republican nominee vice president george bush who calls houston 
home 
the gop contends dukakis will have an unfair advantage in the 
lone star state and elsewhere as long as bentsen can raise and 
spend unlimited amounts on his senate campaign 
if bentsen were to drop out of the senate race before the 
november election boulter would win the seat should bentsen win 
both races and become vice president gov bill clements would 
appoint a successor pending a special election 
nearly 17 million of the 61 million bentsen raised during 
1987 and the first six months of this year was from political 
action committee contributions boulter collected 73911 in pac 
donations during the period 
bentsen spent about 3 million during the 18 monthperiod while 
boulter spent 582721 according to finance reports filed this 
week with the fec 
based on campaign finance reports for the period jan 1 1987 
to the end of march 1988 the fec ranked bentsen as the leader 
among congressional candidates in overall contributions and pac 
receipts 
for the spring reporting period april 1 through june 30 
bentsen raised and spent just over 1 million about 236169 of 
the money raised came from pac contributions

the head of an arabamerican group is 
condemning a federal prosecutor who said one of eight men accused 
of illegal prolibyan activities was involved in a plot to 
assassinate a highlevel us official 
an administration source later identified the target as former 
national security council aide oliver l north 
the comments by us attorney henry hudson about an 
assassination plot are outrageous unsubstantiated allegations 
which are not even part of the charges in this case abdeen 
jabara president of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee said thursday 
hudson made the comments wednesday in alexandria va in a 
court appearance by six men charged with violating the us 
economic boycott of libya 
the men allegedly used money sent from libya to support 
prolibya demonstrations in the united states and to finance travel 
to libya by american minorities the boycott allows such money to 
be used only for the educational expenses of libyan students in the 
united states 
two other men were charged in the same case in denver and ann 
arbor mich 
during the alexandria court appearance hudson said one of those 
charged mousa hawamda was involved in a potential plot to 
assassinate a high government official of the united states an 
administration source speaking on the condition of anonymity 
identified the target as north who as a national security council 
aide masterminded counterterrorism activities against libya 
including the april 1986 bombing of tripoli 
one of hawamdas attorneys russell gaspar said in an interview 
that we deny on behalf of hawamda involvement in any sort of 
assassination plot he said he and hawamdas other attorney ray 
hanna would seek to have their client released all six were 
detained without bond 
jabara also said his office has received a recent rash of calls 
from arabamericans across the nation who have been harassed by the 
fbi with unannounced visits to them and their neighbors that were 
intended to gather information about political views and activities 
as opposed to criminal activities 
sue schnitzer an fbi spokeswoman had no comment on jabaras 
remarks she said information about political views and activities 
might be sought in investigations involving for example foreign 
counterintelligence or terrorism but she denied that the bureau 
would conduct an investigation that was politically motivated

here is the transcript of the speech delivered by 
ohio sen john glenn introducing sen lloyd bentsen of texas to the 
democratic national convention thursday night 
thank you thank you thank you very much thank you 
thank you all very very much this evening 
i just knew id be making a speech tonight about the vice 
presidency 
and i am here to say this ohio democrats will rally to this 
ticket and on november 8th ohio will lead the way in giving 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen the victory that will change the 
course of this nation thank you 
now now i dont know now i dont know of course who george 
bush will choose as his running mate 
but i do know that lloyd bentsen will be the next vice president 
of the united states 
and he is superbly qualified for the job 
war hero lawyer businessman congressman 
senator chairman of the senate finance committee 
and you want to know something to get to the senate in 1970 
lloyd bentsen beat george bush 
and this november he and michael dukakis will do it again 
and and theyll win because and thats because lloyd bentsen 
not only comes from texas but hes a real texan 
now we all know we all here know that there are other people 
who say theyre real texans too 
but let me ask you this question 
how many real texans do you know whose idea of mexican food is 
re fried quiche 
and there are many other differences as well 
this administration talks about fiscal responsibility 
but their plan consists of the same old formula more tax cuts 
for the rich and more budget cuts for everyone else 
well lloyd bentsen believes its time we stopped asking this 
nation to choose between fiscal responsibility and moral 
responsibility 
lloyd bentsen knows we must have both and he rejects the idea 
that we should be hard on needy children and easy on greedy 
defense contractors 
and lloyd bentsen knows that on economics the republicans have 
it backwards true prosperity always flows up from the people and 
never trickles down from the powerful 
this white house says theres nothing we can do about unfair 
foreign trade that closes american factories and steals american 
jobs 
well lloyd bentsen believes that when other countries take 
advantage of us you cant talk like rambo and act like bambi 
and lloyd bentsen knows that with the right tools and a fair 
chance america can still outwork out invent out produce and out 
compete any nation on the face of this earth 
and when it comes to womens rights and civil rights george 
bush is part of an administration that has consistently taken its 
cues from rightwing zealots 
they gloated about the temporary defeat of the era and then 
boasted about appointing a woman to the supreme court 
well lloyd bentsen knows there is a huge difference between 
making one woman a justice and bringing justice to american women 
let me add just another note here about the right wing let me 
say that i am also tired of rightwing religious extremism 
and of those who believe that they and only hold the truth now 
on both things we democrats are willing to compromise for the good 
of the country but when it comes to the separation of church and 
state there must and should be no compromise 
we democrats treasure our churches and we treasure our faiths 
ive been an elder in the presbyterian church for over 25 years 
but ill tell you what i believe i believe that the last thing 
that this country needs is to have the gospels of matthew mark 
luke and john rewritten by meese bakker swaggart and falwell 
our opponents also talk about law and order and about how 
george bush will be tough on crime 
but in this administration over 100 officials have already been 
indicted or left office under an ethical cloud 
yet despite that record they tell us they want four more 
years 
well i can tell you something at the rate theyre going i 
think some of em are going to end up serving ten to twenty 
you know you know i saw vice president bush on tv the other 
day talking about how democrats are somehow soft on defense 
and that bothered me in fact it angered me 
lloyd bentsen was a combat bomber pilot during world war ii 
and he knows that we americans must always be ready to defend 
ourselves because the very first obligation of government is to 
keep our people alive and independent and free 
and if american lives are ever at stake during the next 
administration whether in beirut the persian gulf or anywhere 
else i can promise you that when major decisions are being made 
vice president bentsen will not be out of the room out of pocket 
out of town or out of touch 
and i can tell you this when michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
tell us they will make no deals with terrorists like the 
ayatollah or drugpushing dictators like noriega they mean no way 
no lies no secrets no deals period 
my fellow democrats i am indeed honored to introduce a decent 
and caring man a good friend a great senator and the next vice 
president of the united states lloyd bentsen

jesse jackson setting aside disagreements and 
disappointment strode to the convention podium thursday night to 
stand with michael dukakis in the unity gesture the democratic 
presidential nominee had long desired 
we have a good ticket and a good team jackson said 
afterward and if the unity that is expressed here tonight is 
sustained and expands we will win and we will deserve to win he 
said 
i feel fantastic 
the packed hall exploded in cheers as jackson and his wife 
joined dukakis and his wife on the platform where dukakis had 
formally accepted the partys presidential nomination moments 
before 
the onetime rivals talked animatedly and then jackson kissed 
kitty dukakis 
jackson whose presence has electrified many a hall slipped 
into the omni unnoticed until dukakis waved to the civil rights 
leader as he sat with former president jimmy carter 
the massachusetts governor called jackson a man who has lifted 
so many hearts with the dignity and the hope of his message 
throughout this campaign a man whose very candidacy says to every 
child aim high to every citizen you count to every voter 
you can make a difference to every american you are a full 
shareholder in our dream 
jackson and carter stood together and accepted the cheers of the 
crowd 
then dukakis closed his speech by praising jacksons children 
who had introduced their father to the convention tuesday night 
what stirred me most on tuesday were those fine handsome and 
proud and articulate jackson children talking about their hopes for 
the future of this country dukakis said you know young 
jacqueline jackson goes to school in massachusetts and last month 
she visited with me at the statehouse in boston shes a remarkable 
young woman and i know her parents are very proud of her 
earlier jackson had instructed his delegates to back lloyd 
bentsen of texas for vice president despite the tension with 
jackson after dukakis choose the senator 
the vice presidential nomination is appropriately the choice 
of the presidential nominee while i may disagree with both 
governor dukakis and senator bentsen on some important issues our 
interests converge in building a coalition to beat the republicans 
this fall jackson said in a statement we democrats will be 
united in the fall in support of the dukakisbentsen ticket 
we will all be represented in the fall campaign councils and 
i will make sure that the progressive agenda remains an integral 
part of the democratic vision jackson said 
at the end of the remarkably peaceful and united democratic 
national convention jackson linked arms with bentsens wife in a 
line with the presidential nominee and his wife to join in signing 
the battle hymn of the republic 
but earlier he hinted at future retribution against some 
democratic super delegates saying his supporters won elections 
in the streets they lost them in the suites 
the democratic runnerup singled out new york mayor ed koch for 
particular criticism equating his activities in the new york 
primary with those of the late richard daley in chicago during the 
bloody 1968 convention 
jackson his presidential bid over met with supporters 
throughout the day thanking them for their efforts and looking 
toward the general election against george bush and the republicans 
last night went very well jackson said it showed 
tremendous expansion in our party 
jacksons national campaign chairman california assembly 
speaker willie brown brushed off suggestions that the dukakis 
campaign was not offering enough spots to jackson aides 
jacksons people and dukakis people are now one and the 
same said brown as jackson met with members of the congressional 
black caucus 
but jackson was angered by not winning states in the delegate 
roll call that he had won in the primaries and caucuses 
those states we won in the primaries we should have won last 
night he told reporters the downside of the roll call was 
just the revelation of the role that the super delegates played 
this did so much violence to their constituencies 
jackson won 13 states but had delegate majorities in only four 
he won alabama alaska delaware georgia louisiana mississippi 
and puerto rico but dukakis had a delegate majority in each 
jackson won michigan and virginia but the final delegate tally in 
each was a tie 
jackson was complaining that the super delegates more than 600 
party and elected officials with automatic seats at the convention 
did not vote the way of their constituents in the roll call he 
is fond of pointing out that he had the votes of only one state 
party chairman and one us senator 
it was not good for people in virginia louisiana and places 
like that where the people won and then super delegates imposed 
their will upon the people they won the elections in the 
streets they lost them in the suites he said 
jackson did not name any particular super delegates but he did 
point to koch as a divisive figure in the 1988 campaign 
as he praised atlanta mayor andrew young for his handling of the 
convention this year jackson told a group of black businessmen 
we have had mayors who destroyed democratic conventions or 
democratic primaries you look at daley in 68 or koch in 88 
daleys handling of demonstrators at the 1968 convention led to 
bloody confrontations in the streets and political turmoil in the 
hall koch made pointed criticisms of jackson in the new york 
primary saying jewish voters should not back the black candidate 
because of his antiisrael positions 
but jackson said he was not talking about retribution 
i would never do a thing like retribution i do believe in 
accountability i do believe in reciprocity he said 
in the 13 states and 100 congressional districts he said he won 
in the primaries jackson said his supporters would be talking to 
those super delegates who did not back his candidacy on wednesday 
night 
there will be vigorous activities at the state and 
congressional district level for new relationships with 
congresspeople senators and governors he said 
jackson said the changes he pushed for in the 1992 party rules 
will help his cause cutting the number of super delegates by a 
third

a federal appeals court has overturned a judges 
decision to combine 35000 asbestosrelated lawsuits against a 
chicago company after some of those who filed the suits objected 
last month us district judge robert l vining jr 
consolidated 35000 personal injury law suits pending against 
raymark industries inc in response to a defense motion in an 
asbestosrelated injury claim of an atlanta couple 
that decision which had created one of the largest personal 
injury cases and the largest asbestosrelated injury case ever was 
overturned by three judges of the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals 
according to federal court records more than 100 plaintiffs 
objected to having their lawsuits against raymark consolidated into 
one complaint because none of them had been notified about legal 
efforts that sought the class action the plaintiffs also 
complained that the evidence considered by the federal court was 
not enough to justify such a major decision 
in an order wednesday judge frank johnson wrote that the 
district courts order will delay resolution of their claims 
indefinitely 
the courts order which essentially moves their cases back to 
square one could hardly place petitioners in a more drastic 
predicament wrote johnson 
raymark has been the target of 70000 personal injury lawsuits 
involving 82000 people in the past 10 years the suits claim that 
people developed asbestosrelated diseases after exposure to 
insulation and other raymark products at construction and 
shipbuilding sites and factories 
half of the 70000 cases already have been resolved by trial 
outofcourt settlement or dismissal

european and indian satellites 
soared smoothly into orbit aboard an ariane3 rocket that lifted 
off from the european space agency launch site in the jungle of 
french guiana 
the rocket was fired without a hitch at 712 pm edt thursday 
from the launch pad in kourou on the northeastern coast of south 
america it was the 24th launch for arianespace the company 
responsible for commercial flights of european rockets and the 
fourth this year 
cloudy weather at the launch site caused a sixminute delay in 
the countdown moments after the rocket took off its brilliant 
orange flame was obscured by the low clouds 
seventeen minutes after takeoff the rocket reached the orbiting 
altitude of 22500 miles 
within four minutes the two satellites were launched toward 
stationary positions above the earth they are ecs5 for eutelsat 
the european organization of satellite communications and insat1c 
for the indian space research organization 
we are particularly happy tonight to have successfully 
launched the indian satellite said frederic dallest director 
of arianespace 
arianespace has put 11 satellites into orbit in 11 months 
and the company has additional launches scheduled for september 
october november and december he said nine launches are set for 
1989 
there will be no vacation for ariane he said adding that 
the rocket to be launched sept 7 will carry two more satellites 
into orbit 
ariane3 is capable of lifting 28 tons into space compared to 
the new generation ariane4 rocket which can carry a maximum load 
of 46 tons the new powerful rocket was launched for the first 
time june 15 and carried three satellites into orbit it is 
scheduled to blast off again in november 
the versatile ariane4 developed at a cost of 575 million 
will be used with increasing frequency between november and 1991 to 
meet arianespaces backlog of 42 launch orders 
ecs5 weighing 2607 pounds was constructed jointly by the 
french aerospace and defense giant matra and british aerospace the 
satellite will upgrade long distance telephone service from 
portugal to finland and turkey to ireland during its sevenyear 
lifespan 
eutelsat which groups 26 national telecommunications 
authorities had reserved a place on the american atlas centaur 
rocket in case of setbacks in the arianespace program 
on may 31 1986 technicians were forced to destroy an ariane2 
rocket shortly after liftoff when a problem in the thirdstage 
ignition caused the rocket to go off course arianespace suspended 
launches for 16 months after the failure 
insat1c constructed by ford aerospace has a lifespan of 10 
years it will expand television and longdistance telephone 
service and collect meteorological data 
the 2618pound satellite was originally to be carried by an 
american rocket but after the failure of the us space shuttle 
challenger indian authorities decided to put their valuable cargo 
aboard an ariane under a contract worth 50 million 
the space shuttle program was grounded after seven astronauts 
were killed in the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster 
a small leak on the launch pad now threatens to delay the 
scheduled september launching of the next us space shuttle 
mission by as much as two months us officials said space 
shuttle discovery is scheduled to take a crew of five astronauts 
into space 
before the thursday launch pramod kale director of isro said 
that for five years telecommunications in india has relied on a 
single satellite the next insat satellite is scheduled for 
launching in early 1989 aboard an american delta rocket 
kale said that until insat1b was launched in 1983 television 
reached only the larger indian cities now because of satellite 
communications 70 percent of the countrys population has access 
to television 
arianespace now hauls half the worlds commercial payloads and 
holds launch contracts worth 25 billion eight launches are 
scheduled for 1988 with nine launches a year planned beginning in 
1989

recent thundershowers have helped cool off the 
superheated soybean market somewhat but agriculture department 
analysts figure there will be enough excitement to go around for a 
while anyway 
some futures contracts on the chicago board of trade soared to 
around 11 per bushel earlier this month as heat and drought 
continued to fry 1988 harvest prospects rains have since dampened 
things a bit with prices around 850 or so per bushel on thursday 
the departments economic research service says the soybean 
market simply has been up to its old tricks volatility 
excitement and surprise historically soybean trading has kept 
everyone on their toes 
in recent years however the market has been relatively 
subdued says a report in a forthcoming issue of farmline 
magazine in fact us growers have struggled through a 
disappointing period of increased foreign competition cutbacks in 
domestic production and lower prices 
but this year even before the impact of the drought became 
obvious there were big tremors in the soybean market when it 
appeared demand might outstrip or come close to eating up the us 
stockpile of oldcrop beans 
this has been a good year for exports of us oilseeds 
despite record world oilseed production and a significant increase 
in south american soybean production the report said 
soybean exports projected at 785 million bushels in 198788 
are the highest in five years coupled with domestic use that was 
expected to trim us soybean inventories to around 290 million 
bushels by the time the new marketing year begins on sept 1 down 
from 436 million bushels a year ago 
new projections for 198889 showed a further shrinkage in 
soybean reserves to less than 150 million bushels by sept 1 1989 
domestic demand for soybean meal and sales of soybean oil also 
have been heavy 
in this country soybean use has risen for three straight 
years and production has declined the last two years the report 
said world inventories have been falling for several years 
the united states is still the world leader in the production 
and exporting of soybeans although some of that edge has been lost 
in recent years 
a peak was reached in 1979 when american farmers produced 226 
billion bushels of soybeans output averaged 193 billion bushels 
during the 1980s 
meanwhile world production of soybeans increased fivefold in 
the last 30 years the report said brazil and argentina have 
rapidly expanded since 1970 between 1980 and 1987 total south 
american acreage increased nearly 40 percent to 384 million acres 
and production rose 46 percent to 104 billion bushels 
consequently the us share of world soybean production dropped 
to 56 percent by the mid1980s from 74 percent in the late 1960s 
the us domination of the world soybean market has eroded 
because of south american competition more foreign production of 
tree oils such as palm oil and greater oilseed production in 
europe the report said 
until this year the report said the 1980s had not been an 
outstanding decade for us soybeans and the outlook is 
uncertain 
the report added world demand for protein meals and vegetable 
oils is not increasing fast enough to accommodate more growth in 
south american production without further displacing production 
from the united states

one police officer was sentenced to life in 
prison and five others to terms up to 15 years for torturing to 
death a factory chief accused of throwing acid in someones face 
an official report said today 
the china daily said the sentences were handed down by a court 
in central chinas henan province in the death of li rongcheng the 
head of a factory run by a school in xinxiang city 
the report said li was detained last december as a suspect after 
a teacher at the school was splashed in the face with sulfuric acid 
wang weiying deputy head of the local police department 
instructed and joined the other five in beating li with an electric 
club and torturing him in other ways during 18 hours of 
questioning the newspaper said li died after the ordeal 
an autopsy found that li was injured on 30 places on his body 
the china daily said the autopsy concluded that li who had a 
heart condition died of heart failure from physical abuse 
wang received a life sentence while the other five received 
sentences ranging from two to 15 years the newspaper said 
the torturing of common criminals and those with suspect 
political backgrounds was widespread during the ultraleftist 
196676 cultural revolution but has since been banned 
however chinese legal officials acknowledge there are still 
incidents of police abusing their power and the official media 
occasionally spotlights cases where suspects are tortured by police 
or deprived of their legal rights

the soviet union is promoting a withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia and pursuing a settlement with 
china in a policy reversal that could pave the way to a summit 
meeting of the two communist superpowers 
for years the soviets took the position that what their ally 
vietnam did in cambodia was hanois responsibility and not 
moscows but soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has now seized on 
hanois announcement that 50000 troops would be withdrawn from 
cambodia this year to authorize a highlevel sinosoviet meeting 
the talks will center on ending the war in cambodia and be held 
either at the end of this month or in august secretary of state 
george p shultz was informed by chinese officials in beijing and 
he offered public encouragement thursday in a speech in honolulu 
the soviet union as vietnams principal supporter has a 
clear responsibility to help bring this tragic conflict to an 
end shultz said therefore i have had increasingly frequent 
exchanges with the soviet foreign minister in order to encourage a 
constructive stance on their part 
shultz added i am encouraged by the tone and content of these 
contacts 
the meeting at the vice premier level could remove the major 
roadblock to a sinosoviet summit meeting another is being cleared 
with the withdrawal of the red army from afghanistan 
us policy calls for coupling the demand for vietnams 
withdrawal from cambodia with support for prince sihanouk as 
shultz said the genuine leader of an independent cambodian 
government 
however the united states may not be able to ensure that the 
country does not again fall into the hands of the khmer rouge who 
were accused of murdering millions of cambodians and whose excesses 
made it easier for vietnam to take charge a decade ago 
shultz pledged in hawaii to continue to support measures which 
could be implemented in the context of a settlement that rejects a 
return to control by the khmer rouge 
the soviets switch on cambodia was presaged by a speech 
gorbachev made in vladivostok two years ago proposing that china 
and vietnam hold talks on the vietnamese situation the speech 
hinted at moscows interest in an end to hanois military 
occupation 
beginning next monday cambodian guerrillas vietnamese 
officials and representatives of the provietnam government in 
cambodia will meet in jakarta indonesia to set the stage for the 
talks between the soviet union and china 
a serious squabble there could upset prospects for success 
also sihanouk who resigned this month from the presidency of the 
threeparty guerrilla coalition accused vietnam on thursday of 
being unwilling to conduct serious talks 
vietnam moved into cambodia in 1979 the withdrawal of 50000 of 
the estimated 125000 vietnamese troops in the country may be 
related to gorbachevs withdrawal from afghanistan his removal of 
short and mediumrange nuclear weapons from eastern europe and 
speculation he will pull the red army out of hungary ending a 
32year occupation

michael dukakis accepting the democratic 
presidential nomination as a son of immigrants and product of the 
american dream proclaimed thursday night that the reagan era is 
over and a new era is about to begin 
in remarks to the closing session of the democratic national 
convention the massachusetts governor pledged to forge a new era 
of greatness for america 
the nominee was introduced by his cousin academy award winning 
actress olympia dukakis who narrated a brief film with scenes from 
his life including his home in brookline mass and the 
25yearold snowblower she wheeled out of the garage as an example 
of his tightfistedness 
he opened his speech by recalling the night of the oscar 
ceremonies when ms dukakis raised her oscar over her head and 
said ok michael lets go 
the nominees eyes filled with tears and he bowed his head 
briefly when he referred to his late father the young man who 
arrived at ellis island with only 25 in his pocket but with a 
deep and abiding faith in the promise in america 
the joyful democrats who packed the hall cheered lustily when he 
told them were going to win this race ninetyone times they 
interrupted him with cheers and applause 
at one point when dukakis said he wanted a vice president who 
wont sit silently by the delegates began a chant that had 
become one of the themes of the convention where was george 
a reference to vice president george bush 
for many of the party faithful it was the first opportunity for 
genuine cheers since the republican era was ushered in by ronald 
reagan in 1980 
it was shortly after 11 oclock when dukakis finished speaking 
and his wife joined him on the podium they embraced and then texas 
sen lloyd bentsen the vice presidential nominee and his wife 
ba also stepped into the spotlight 
the podium quickly became a family scene with the children and 
parents of both nominees joining them 
then in the traditional unity gesture jesse jackson and his 
wife jacqueline also stepped to the podium following them were 
the other democrats who had lost out to dukakis in the contest for 
the nomination 
before dukakis was introduced his fatherinlaw harry ellis 
dickson associate conductor emeritus of the boston pops orchestra 
conducted fanfare for michael dukakis composed for the 
occasion by john williams 
for dukakis the speech marked the culmination of a 16month 
campaign for his partys presidential nomination and the formal 
opening of his challenge to bush 
after the convention ended dukakis his family and bentsen and 
his wife walked across the street to the georgia world congress 
center where they received thunderous applause from thousands of 
delegates celebrating at a victory party 
in the fiveminute impromptu remarks he urged the delegates not 
to ease up their support for the ticket warning this is going 
to be a tough tight competitive race 
dukakis and bentsen will leave the convention city together on 
friday for joint campaign appearances in texas california north 
dakota missouri and pennsylvania 
the nominee paid tribute to jackson as a man who has lifted so 
many hearts with the dignity and the hope of his message throughout 
this campaign a man whose very candidacy says to every child aim 
high to every citizen you count to every voter you make a 
difference to every american you are full shareholder in our 
dream 
jackson gave dukakis a thumbsup sign when the nominee waved 
the speech echoed familiar themes and phrases from his campaign 
from the call for good jobs at good wages to the pledge to 
wage a real war not a phony war against drugs 
in a reference to the scandals of the reagan administration 
dukakis said that if you accept the privilege of public service 
you had better understand the responsibilities of public service 
if you violate that trust youll be fired if you violate the 
law youll be prosecuted and if you sell arms to the ayatollah 
dont expect a pardon from the president of the united states 
dukakis switched to spanish a language in which he is fluent 
to pay tribute to the late willie velasquez founder of the 
southwest voter education project which registered thousands of 
hispanics to vote 
president reagan came in for praise for his arms control efforts 
he has said that we should judge the soviet union not by what 
it says but by what it does dukakis said of the republican 
president and i agree with that 
we must be and we are and we will be militarily 
strong he pledged in an obvious response to those who criticize 
his weak on defense 
we must always be prepared to defend our freedom he said 
but we must always remember that our greatest strength comes not 
from what we possess but from what we believe not from what we 
have but from who we are 
watching her son accept the presidential nomination was euterpe 
dukakis the nominees mother who came to the united states from 
greece 75 years ago his late father also was a greek immigrant 
and if elected president dukakis would be the first son of two 
immigrant parents to hold the office since andrew jackson 
its time to rekindle the american spirit of invention and 
daring to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics to build 
the best america by bringing out the very best in every american 
said dukakis 
earlier in the day dukakis tried out some selfdeprecating 
humor during a brief appearance at a luncheon sponsored by the 
democratic national committee and the partys house and senate 
campaign committees 
as all of you know im a stemwinding orator he said 
he told the assembled group that his wife kitty had asked if 
she could look at his acceptance speech which he had spent much of 
the week writing 
i said ok and she went into the bedroom he said when i 
went into the room myself to get my jacket my wife was fast asleep 
on the bed and the speech was beside her half read 
in his convention speech dukakis said the democrats would win 
because we are the party that believes in the american dream 
a dream so powerful that no distance of ground no expanse of 
ocean no barrier of language no distinction of race or creed or 
color can weaken its hold on the human heart 
i know because i am a product of that dream 
echoing the call for change that has been a fundamental part of 
the his campaign dukakis said that maintaining the status quo 
running in place standing still isnt good enough for america 
opportunity for some isnt good enough for america 
touching on another of his campaign themes the need for people 
to work together dukakis talked about the idea of community 
it is the idea that we are in this together that regardless 
of who we are or where we come from or how much money we have 
each of us counts and that by working together to create 
opportunity and a good life for all all of us are enriched not 
just in economic terms but as citizens and as human beings 
he said that as president he would set goals for our country 
not goals for our government working alone i mean goals for our 
people working together 
four years from now he said he hoped people would be proud of 
their government proud of a government that sets high standards 
not just for the american people but high standards for itself

the white house is pushing for a 
strong meaningful bipartisan package of aid to nicaraguan 
rebels but is stopping short of saying whether the package should 
include lethal military assistance 
it is something that were going to be discussing with the 
congressional leadership next week white house chief of staff 
kenneth m duberstein said thursday as he briefed reporters after a 
meeting of top presidential aides on foreign and domestic issues 
he said reagan who winds up a weeklong vacation at his ranch 
north of santa barbara on sunday will meet with republican 
congressional leaders on tuesday 
duberstein said thursdays 3hour meeting of 15 of reagans top 
aides was designed to lay out a positive energetic active last 
six months of his presidency to reinforce the themes of the first 
7 years 
reagans second term will end jan 20 
the staff input today was to go forward on a strong 
meaningful bipartisan package on contra aid and it is something 
that we will be talking to the leadership about next week 
duberstein said 
the chief of staff did not reply directly however when asked 
whether the administration would press for lethal as well as 
humanitarian assistance 
it is something that we are going to be working with the 
congress to make sure that we can get as much as possible to 
support the peace efforts that we have under way he said 
it was not the first time the administration has struck a note 
of reticence as it weighs new approaches for dealing with the 
increasingly defiant leftist government of nicaragua in the wake of 
congressional action in february cutting off military aid to the 
rebels 
in a june 18 radio address the president said the congressional 
cutoff of aid was a dangerous gamble with our national security 
and added we must work for a free nicaragua but time is 
growing short he did not however spell out what steps should 
be taken 
on june 29 speaking in support of republican senatorial 
candidate rep connie mack iii in miami he said again without 
being specific connie mack and i stand with the nicaraguan 
resistance we will not rest until we have won for them the full 
support they need 
then on july 13 reagan was asked whether he was going to 
request military aid and responded im trying to consider 
whether i should answer that or not its almost like giving 
something away while were still at work he never did answer 
on july 15 the president ducked a question as to whether there 
was now a consensus in congress for lethal aid saying im not 
in a position to estimate or make any count of that 
in a speech in los angeles on tuesday lt gen colin l powell 
the presidents national security adviser said congress and the 
president need to come to agreement on a program of effective aid 
for the nicaraguan resistance as an adjunct to our diplomatic 
strategy 
but powell did not define effective any more than reagan 
said what he meant by full support or duberstein by 
meaningful assistance 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan has introduced a bill 
that would provide for humanitarian assistance and put some lethal 
aid in an escrow account to be released if the president certified 
it was needed 
were going to take a look at the dole package which we have 
generally supported and talk with others on the hill as far as 
getting cosponsors and making sure that it is something that we can 
get through the senate and that will provide for the needs that we 
see duberstein said

a laboratory experiment by two cleveland 
researchers may help to explain why a diet rich in coldwater fish 
helps to prevent heart attacks 
in a study published today in the journal science paul l fox 
and paul e dicorleto of the cleveland clinic research institute 
report that in testtube experiments they have shown that oil 
extracted from fish that live in cold water will depress production 
of a protein called the plateletderived growth factor 
reducing this protein fox said in a telephone interview 
suppresses the growth of smooth muscle cells in arteries and thus 
helps stem the bloodvessel narrowing that can lead to a heart 
attack 
but fox said the finding does not mean that people should start 
popping fishoil pills as a heart attack preventative more study 
must be done before there is proof that such dietary supplements 
can be effective he said 
i would not personally recommend that people take fish oil 
fox said i dont think its bad for you but i would recommend a 
more prudent diet which would include eating fish several times a 
week 
several studies including research among greenland eskimos and 
fishermen in japan and holland have shown that a diet that 
includes lots of fish may be responsible for the low incidence of 
heart disease among those groups 
researchers previously have suggested the reason such diets are 
beneficial is that the flesh of cold water fish such as cod 
halibut and tuna contains an oil rich in a particular type of 
fatty acid 
but fox said researchers still arent sure precisely how the oil 
works to prevent heart attack 
some researchers have suggested the oils reduce the blood levels 
of cholesterol and triglyceride both of which play a role in the 
narrowing of arteries others suggest the fish oil changes the 
clotting rate in the blood which helps prevent blockages fox said 
he and dicorleto have found still another way in which fish oil may 
fight heart disease 
in testtube experiments fox said his team has found that fish 
oil reduces by 50 percent to 85 percent the production of the 
plateletderived growth factor protein he said similar tests using 
peanut oil had no effect on the growth factor production while 
safflower oil was less than 10 percent as effective 
he said the growth factor protein normally stimulates 
proliferation of smooth muscle cells which line the outside of 
arteries fox said the growth of these muscle cells is thought to 
promote the lesions in the arteries that can lead to blockages the 
basic problem in the heart disease process called atherosclerosis 
were not sure which of the three suggested mechanisms is 
responsible for the beneficial effects of fish oil said fox 
two or all three may play a role thats often the way it is in 
biology 
he said the theories need to be tested in humans or animals 
only then said fox will it be known exactly how fish oil works to 
reduce heart attack and in what form the oil should be taken into 
the human diet 
the oil from coldwater fish is more fluid than oil from beef or 
pork and is less likely to produce the solid molecules that can 
clog arteries said fox fish living in deep cold water are 
thought to have developed this oil to help them function in the 
chilly depths where they live he said

the nuclear regulatory commission and us 
nuclear industry are undertaking steppedup efforts to deal with 
the use of substandard components in nuclear power plants 
according to nrc officials 
they told a commission briefing thursday that although the 
problem is serious it does not appear to pose immediate safety 
hazards 
we have a very serious issue before us said nrc chairman 
lando w zech jr weve just got to get our arms around it and 
find out exactly how big the problem is 
at issue are components ranging from defective bolts and other 
fasteners to used circuit breakers that were falsely labeled as new 
and first discovered this spring at a california nuclear power 
plant 
thomas murley the nrcs director of reactor regulation said 
his office has issued special information bulletins to nuclear 
plant operators and was cooperating with the agencys office of 
investigations 
possible changes in nrc regulations are being considered to help 
deal with the components problem he said but its too early to 
tell where that will lead us 
murley said he believes the great majority of deficiencies 
in plant equipment will be spotted through regular checks as part 
of the nrcs quality assurance program 
still we acknowledge that the quality assurance program is 
not perfect he said 
overall murley said our conclusion is that we must continue 
to deal with the problem but there is no immediate safety issue 
victor stello the nrcs executive director for operations 
said i am persuaded that the nuclear industry now recognizes 
that they do indeed have a serious problem 
the nrc announced earlier this month that it was investigating 
five california companies for their alleged role in supplying used 
circuit breakers falsely labeled as new equipment 
after seizing documents during searches at the companies 
offices the nrc sent notices july 8 to nuclear plants across the 
country 
the used circuit breakers which serve the same function as 
fuses in shutting off power to prevent short circuits or fires 
were first discovered at the diablo canyon nuclear power plant near 
san luis obispo calif when they failed tests there in april 
in june stello told a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
that more than half of the countrys 109 nuclear reactors had some 
substandard studs and bolts in safetyrelated locations 
stello testified that the problem stemmed from failure to test 
crucial steel bolts that suppliers sold to reactor operators as 
being resistant to bending under stress 
members of the subcommittee asserted that some of the suppliers 
may have profited by deliberately marketing weak fasteners falsely 
labeled as high tensile 
according to information supplied by the nrc to the house panel 
utilities operating 66 reactors in 31 states had reported the 
presence of bad bolts eight to 10 percent of a small sample 
surveyed by the utilities last fall at the agencys request were 
below required specifications for tensile strength hardness 
resistance to stretching or chemical composition

us disarmament officials are trying to 
mobilize sentiment against chemical and biological weapons by 
focusing public attention on the potential danger posed by these 
weapons in the hands of terrorists 
im not here to terrify people but i think before the 
terrorism is upon us we need to start addressing the problem 
kathleen c bailey assistant director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency said thursday 
biological weapons programs are in progress around the world 
but because of secrecy restrictions it is going to take some 
time before we can get out to the public to make an issue ms 
bailey told an audience at the heritage foundation a conservative 
policy research group 
the terrorist angle is likely to bring public attention 
considering the relative ease with which chemical and biological 
weapons can be transported without detection she said 
when you can tell people in new york city or atlanta or 
wherever that somebody can walk in with a suitcase that can 
hold things that can kill an awful lot of people in a small area 
such as chemical weapons or an even larger number of people over a 
broader area biological weapons you can get some excitement 
going 
without identifying countries ms bailey said the us 
government had evidence that in 1972 at least seven countries had 
chemical warfare programs and four had germ warfare programs 
today this has increased to 20 countries testing chemical weapons 
and 10 testing biological weapons she said 
the united states is working at the diplomatic level to gain 
support for a comprehensive verifiable ban on chemical weapons far 
beyond the existing 1925 geneva protocol ms bailey said but i 
dont think were succeeding in bringing the rest of the world 
along with us very well i would like see much more in cooperation 
with our allies 
more public diplomacy would be useful she said and greater 
effort is needed to raise the level of abhorrence

the final night of the democratic national 
convention had at least one thing in common with the first three 
parties 
the last night on the party circuit included a large victory 
88 party at the georgia world congress center next door to the 
convention hall and planned bashes by the michael dukakislloyd 
bentsen and jesse jackson campaigns 
dukakis and bentsen received thunderous applause from a crowd of 
thousands delegates and others who attended or worked at the 
convention when they walked across the street at the close of the 
convention to the victory 88 party 
this has been a great convention and it sets the stage for a 
great democratic victory in november of 1988 dukakis told the 
throng after thanking atlanta mayor andrew young and the city of 
atlanta for hosting the convention 
later he warned his supporters not to ease up their support for 
the ticket were going to need you all this is going to be a 
tough tight competitive race 
when he completed his five minutes of impromptu remarks an 
orchestra started playing greek tunes and dukakis danced two or 
three steps setting off wild cheers 
bentsen said the convention had produced the most enthusiastic 
and united democratic party that i have ever seen 
earlier in the evening when convention activities got under way 
at the omni contributors to the democratic party of georgia 
mingled over drinks at a party next door at the omni hotel 
at first journalists were denied entrance this is private 
you know for mucketymucks said democratic doorkeeper scott 
sikes 
but reporters later were admitted and inside the reception room 
were the backbone of any successful political endeavor the 
nonfamous loyalists who give money 
the contributors watched on giantscreen tv as georgia high 
school bands marched in the convention hall and they stood up 
drinks held aloft as lynda carter sang the national anthem 
just down marietta street at the metroplex rock nightclub 
ticket prices were cut from 10 to 6 for the final night of the 
alternative 88 convention a scheduled appearance by comedian 
pat paulsen was cancelled but alternative conventioneers could 
hear three rock bands and a political satiristcomic 
also planned was an austin to boston party hosted by the 
massachusetts and texas delegations which expected appearances by 
dukakis and bentsen

the air force has acknowledged that its 
initial report on a 1986 radioactive spill at an ohio military base 
was incomplete but is protesting a proposed fine as unwarranted 
air force documents show 
the documents released thursday by the nuclear regulatory 
commission were prepared by the air force in response to a 
proposed fine of 102500 by the nrc in connection with the 
incident at wrightpatterson air force base near dayton 
the nrc said the proposed fine is for willful failure to report 
the spill within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an 
individual to the radioactive powder 
however the air force argued that under the facts of the 
incident the requirements do not clearly mandate a report within 
24 hours 
through a chain of errors but without any intent to withhold 
information or deceive the subsequent report from the air force 
was neither full nor complete gary vest deputy assistant 
secretary of the air force told the nrc in addition the 
reporting regulation itself is ambiguous

two proabortion nuns have elected to 
resign from their order and stand with women rather than remain 
part of a patriarchal roman catholic church 
we arent nuns anymore said barbara ferraro and patricia 
hussey said thursday announcing an end to their long battle with 
the vatican over their right to support abortion 
for us to stand with women we need to renounce the 
differences privileges and even limitations that are part of 
membership in a religious community in a patriarchal church they 
said in a resignation letter 
the two said they will remain in the church 
six weeks ago the sisters of notre dame de namur decided to 
drop expulsion proceedings against hussey and ferraro 
the two have been at odds with the order since oct 7 1984 
when they and 94 other catholics including 22 other nuns and four 
priests signed a statement published in the new york times saying 
there is a diversity of opinion about abortion within the church 
catholic leaders threatened the priests and nuns who signed the 
statement with dismissal if they didnt recant their statements 
all agreed except for hussey and ferraro whom the church 
repeatedly asked for a retraction 
the sisters of notre dame began dismissal procedures last 
january by issuing a formal canonical warning the nuns who run a 
homeless shelter in charleston responded in a letter saying 
your demands are really an attempt to silence our consciences and 
our public voices on the issue of reproductive rights for women 
a second and final warning was issued in february in june 
however the 184yearold order backed down because the action 
would not be in the best interests of the order and the 
catholic church 
vatican officials still had the option of disciplining the nuns 
but ferraro said she and hussey had not been forced to resign 
although the dismissal procedure played a part in their decision to 
leave 
the violence of the process used with us by the leadership 
the lack of respect and understanding of our motivation for the 
good of the whole church by many in the community are for us 
insurmountable barriers to the reconstruction of a positive 
covenant relationship the nuns resignation letter said 
for the first time in four years we are able to address the 
question of our future in the religious community in a free and 
noncoercive atmosphere they said 
sister catherine hughes general moderator of the order said in 
a statement from rome that she had received word of the nuns 
decision a few days ago 
sisters patricia and barbara have done what the situation and 
their own integrity demanded hughes said they know that the 
prayers of the sisters of notre dame will follow them into the 
future 
ferraro and hussey said they will continue to run covenant 
house a homeless shelter and continue to be active in prochoice 
groups

republican truth squads spent the week trying 
hard to rain on the democrats convention parade but they also 
began to spell out themes that will become grindingly familiar by 
november 
to the extent they have some staying power i think you will 
hear them again said rich galen a spokesman for the national 
republican congressional committee 
beginning last friday with senate republican leader bob dole 
the gop flew in party officials each day to criticize the michael 
dukakislloyd bentsen ticket 
dukakis sought all week to reach out to moderate and 
conservative democrats by picking bentsen and insisting on a 
platform that was deliberately brief 
the republicans however tried to link him with jesse jackson 
and attacked deception in the platform their goal was to tag 
dukakis with a liberal label or the l word as one described 
it 
you dont have to be a political genius to figure out that the 
republicans will want to make that point galen said you dont 
have to be a genius to point at that mike dukakis is a proud 
liberal 
you want to force him back to his home base he said the 
overall strategy was to set that out as a framework 
in their final session on thursday however a panel of gop 
officials broadened the assault and claimed a democratic sleaze 
factor has effectively defused ethical questions which have long 
swirled around the reagan administration most recently around 
attorney general edwin meese 
they noted theres been almost no rhetoric about meese during 
the week though democrats had badly wanted to make him a campaign 
issue 
rep guy vander jagt rmich said democrats were embarrassed 
by house speaker jim wrights role in presiding over the convention 
despite ethical questions which have been raised about him 
i think they have felt uncomfortable talking about sleaze when 
the camera right over the shoulder of the speaker focuses on jim 
wright said vander jagt 
mike mccurry spokesman for the democratic convention said the 
democrats have steered away from highlighting meeses problems 
because we felt in was important to stay focused on delivering a 
positive message about what democrats would do 
the republicans also worked hard to emphasize divisions on the 
dukakisbentsen ticket vander jagt argued that dukakis seemed like 
a moderate during the primaries only because he was running against 
jesse jackson 
with the more conservative bentsen at his side vander jagt 
said voters will begin to view dukakis as a liberal

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
is likely to find that jesse jacksons political blessings are not 
always unmixed 
jackson can be a difficult ally despite his pledges of support 
at the democratic national convention he showed that four years 
ago when it took public coaxing to persuade him to campaign for 
the ticket 
for jackson campaigning is a permanent work in progress even 
as he promised to work for the ticket he said our charge today 
is to learn well the lessons from this campaign and build upon it 
as the vision for the next campaign 
as the atlanta convention ended the most formidable black 
presidential candidate in history stood with dukakis and vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen winners and losers together in 
the traditional show of unity 
so he had stood four years before with walter f mondale then 
as now jackson told the convention he would support its nominee 
it took him a while 
after the cheering was over jackson said he wasnt satisfied 
with the role and status the mondale organization had given him and 
his supporters it took six weeks and a postconvention 
reconciliation conference to produce his unqualified endorsement 
and set him to work campaigning for his cause and for the ticket 
in 1984 mondale promised that black democrats would have key 
roles in his campaign and in the party hierarchy jackson said he 
wanted more specific commitments jackson also said he wasnt 
looking for a job or a title for himself a statement he has 
repeated in atlanta 
after the democrats broke camp in san francisco four years ago 
jackson broke ranks he said the mondale campaign had no strategy 
and no themes to win the black vote he said there were not enough 
blacks or other minorities on the campaign staff 
mondale showed his irritation remarking that he had appointed a 
jackson adviser as a deputy director of his campaign and even that 
didnt help 
jackson kept saying he wanted to support the ticket but had to 
do so with integrity and selfrespect and i must be able to 
convey a message of hope to the people i represent 
those themes too became familiar in atlanta 
jackson said he certainly will work for the ticket but in 
some sense the relationship i will have with the campaign must be 
defined by gov dukakis 
dukakis has been defining it all week with praise for jackson 
and with assurances of roles for him and his allies 
in his acceptance speech dukakis praised jackson as a man 
whose very candidacy says to every child aim high to every 
citizen you count to every voter you can make a difference to 
every american you are a full shareholder in the american dream 
so far jackson has responded in kind while i may disagree 
with both gov dukakis and sen bentsen on some important issues 
our interests converge in building a coalition to beat the 
republicans this fall he said thursday night we will all be 
represented in the fall campaign councils and i will make sure 
that the progressive agenda remains an integral part of the 
democratic vision 
dukakis held his summit with jackson the day the atlanta 
convention opened met with him during the week and has kept their 
staffs in frequent contact 
jackson won a promise of a dozen new seats for his supporters 
when the democratic national committee meets today there is to be 
a vice chairman for minority voter registration he won a change in 
party rules to tie future delegate apportionment more directly to 
primary election results he got some of what he wanted in the 
party platform 
thats not bad for the loser but there could be more on his 
list jackson was meeting today with his delegates and supporters 
to take stock and look ahead he will be launching a political 
action committee to raise funds and work for minority candidates 
in voter registration and in waiting for the next jackson 
campaign 
while dukakis has worked at unity and conciliation he also has 
indicated that there are limits and that he is not yielding the 
party command he won with the nomination 
he needs jackson but not at any price dukakis is not in 
mondales position four years ago the democratic ticket trailed 
hopelessly behind reagan dukakis is dealing from strength he 
leads in early polls 
republicans already are claiming dukakis has made jackson a 
democratic boss one gop spokesman gov james thompson of 
illinois said dukakis made jackson his partner and gave him at 
least as much clout as bentsen will have its all part of the 
republican effort to depict dukakis as a liberal in centrist 
disguise 
any renewal of the 1984 scenario would play into that gop 
strategy dukakis wont let it happen

the democrats put on a slickly produced 
primetime miniseries for the networks but succeeded so well 
that the networks are considering cutting back on future convention 
coverage 
abc news president roone arledge even suggested thursday that 
his network would cut back on coverage for the republican national 
convention in august 
if you keep the conventions in this form obviously its not 
attracting anybody to the process said arledge its driving 
people at home not to watch to find something else rather than 
watch the political process its not healthy for the country 
nbc and cbs said they would give the same coverage to the gop as 
they did to the democrats 
cbs even added an hour to its coverage of the closing session of 
the democratic national convention on thursday night beginning at 
8 pm edt instead of 9 cbs viewers therefore got to see one of 
the better speeches the vibrant and stirring seconding speech for 
lloyd bentsen delivered by former rep barbara jordan speaking 
from her wheelchair nbc and abc joined in midspeech 
cbs declined to run a campaign film on michael dukakis that the 
other networks carried filling in instead with commentary and a 
commercial 
there was controversy at the 1984 gop convention when nbc was 
the only network to carry an 18minute film produced by president 
reagans reelection campaign 
the sixminute dukakis film was narrated by his cousin 
oscarwinning actress olympia dukakis who introduced him on the 
podium 
abc said it ran the dukakis film because it was short nbc and 
cnn ran the dukakis film as just another part of the proceedings 
thursday nights concluding session was dukakis show and after 
three days of primetime coverage of the wellorchestrated and 
therefore mostly dull convention the networks just let it play out 
on thursday 
the ratings for this years democratic convention have been 
running about 10 percent lower than the ratings for the 1984 
convention the networks carried gaveltogavel coverage of the 
conventions until 1984 but ratings have been in a decline since 
1976 thats due in part to the primary system eliminating the 
drama of the nomination conventions but also the proliferation of 
video and cable providing other viewing options 
in order to avoid unsightly conflict the democrats even 
scripted their convention down to the minute to eliminate 
controversy and get favored players primetime exposure 
earlier this year the networks were excited by the prospect of 
contested nominations in both parties and the idea of returning to 
gaveltogavel coverage was even discussed but by the time the 
democrats arrived in atlanta michael dukakis had even selected a 
running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen the only real high point of 
the four nights of primetime coverage came late on tuesday when 
jesse jackson delivered his speech 
arledge who has been most outspoken about the generally 
lackluster event said his networks coverage including two hours 
a night of prime time might be less in 92 if the situation 
were identical it might be less at the republican convention 
depends on what they do arledge said 
vice president george bush has enough delegates for the gop 
nomination he has not selected a running mate yet though 
nbc news president lawrence k grossman said nbc would not cut 
back on the gop out of fairness after giving so much prime time 
exposure to the democrats but would reassess the amount of 
coverage in 1992 
on a basic editorial judgment we would be hard put not to go 
to an hour special a night summarizing the convention in new 
orleans except for the fundamental issues of fairness and 
balance grossman said 
the networks are not constrained by law to give equal time 
because the conventions are considered news events 
cbs news president howard stringer argued that since its 
summer most viewers would just get reruns on the networks anyway 
he wouldnt speculate on 1992 but said the prospect of doing 
primetime coverage remains attractive 
this is a moment perhaps the only moment and there are four 
days of it when the american people can get to know the political 
leaders he said otherwise its a minutetwenty and sound 
bites 
theres always going to be an audience for the process of 
selecting the leadership of the country said cbs anchor dan 
rather on any given night its not going to be as big as the 
audience for whatever inane sitcom is on but some network news 
department is going to cover bank it bet it if nobody else does 
cbs news is going to do it 
former cbs anchor walter cronkite who has been covering 
conventions since 1952 agrees they have become less functional 
we are in the position of covering a staged entertainment and 
it turns out the parties are not nearly as good at that as they are 
at politics he said 
but he said he did not favor cutting coverage i think its a 
shame the public is not more attentive to these proceedings the 
mere gathering of these people in one hall is i think fascinating 
unto itself

actress olympia dukakis gave america a glimpse of 
the life and times of her cousin michael narrating a folksy video 
that ranged from the presidential nominees immigrant roots to his 
tomato plants 
michael and i have been fortunate but were not unique 
millions of americans have worked hard to realize their dreams 
extending these opportunities to everyone is what mikes all 
about the oscarwinning actress said thursday night during her 
introduction of dukakis at the finale of the democratic national 
convention 
we all know that many americans have come to this country with 
nothing nothing but hope well today one of their sons stands

playing on the massachusetts governors wellknown reputation 
for frugality miss dukakis displayed a 25yearold snowblower 
mike says it works as well as it did on the day he bought it 
john his son says its as old as his two sisters i say mike 
gives the word frugal new dimension 
the nominees cousin also took viewers back to dukakis high 
school describing a sportsloving youth who excelled at baseball 
basketball tennis and crosscountry and used to listen to the 
red sox on the radio and figure out batting averages 
michael went away to college planning to follow in his 
fathers footsteps and become a physician but he soon discovered 
his own interests in politics and government she said he was 
inspired by john f kennedy so in 1960 after the army he went to 
the democratic convention soon afterwards he decided to run for 
office 
miss dukakis spoke of her father and uncle who came from greece 
in search of the american dream 
they had no money they didnt know the language what they 
had were dreams a commitment to realize them and a willingness to 
make sacrifices for their children

the democratic national committee is expanding 
its membership and officers to make room for more jesse jackson 
supporters a key provision of the unity agreement between jackson 
and party nominee michael dukakis 
the deal between dukakis and jackson announced on monday ended 
tensions between the two camps and cleared the way for the peaceful 
and united democratic national convention that ended its fourday 
run here thursday night 
the changes in the national partys structure are intended to 
meet the presidential runnerups demand that the dnc be more 
reflective of the rank and file 
dnc chairman paul kirk said he was backing the changes in 
order to give real meaning to the politics of inclusion and 
expansion building on the important efforts that rev jackson 
has made to expand the partys base 
the two most important changes up for dnc approval today would 
add a fourth vice chairman and eight new atlarge members to the 
panel 
the new vice chairman will be designated to head the partys 
voter registration and mobilization efforts a focus of jacksons 
efforts for many years the current three spots traditionally go to 
a woman a black and a hispanic 
the new atlarge seats boost that group to 33 all of whom are 
nominated by the chairman jackson convention manager ron brown 
said this week that jackson would get roughly half the new atlarge 
seats 
all these changes have to be written into the partys charter 
requiring a twothirds vote of the full committee

the network reported thursday that dukakis leaped to a 5341 
percent lead in a survey of 450 registered voters wednesday up 
from his 4546 virtual dead heat with bush in abcs poll sunday 
the movement was 13 points from 1 point down to 12 up 
the jump was expected polls in other elections have found that 
nominees often gain support immediately after their partys 
convention such bumps frequently settle back down as voters focus 
on the substance of the race 
the survey reflected the success of dukakis peacemaking with 
jesse jackson his opponent for the nomination sixtyeight percent 
said dukakis was treating jackson fairly up from 52 percent in a 
poll early this month 
similarly 70 percent said jackson was treating dukakis fairly 
and the share of respondents with an unfavorable view of jackson 
fell 11 points from sunday to 31 percent those with a favorable 
view rose 9 points to 52 
the national survey found a rise in unfavorable views of bush 
who was roundly criticized by convention speakers this week his 
favorable rating fell from 49 percent to 41 percent while those 
viewing him unfavorably rose from 36 percent sunday to 44 percent 
wednesday 
the poll completed the day before dukakis appeared at the 
convention found little change in his favorableunfavorable 
rating 5521 
dukakis 12point lead against bush did not mark his greatest 
numerical advantage in an abc poll the massachusetts governor led 
by 5340 in late may 
the margin of error for the new poll was 5 points 
such singleday surveys particularly when conducted during or 
just after a highly publicized event tend to measure visceral 
reactions rther than considered opinion so the views they gauge 
can change rapidly 
dukakis continued to do better with women voters than with men 
and the poll wednesday found that he had gained more ground among 
women leading bush by 25 points in the new poll up from an 
8point lead sunday dukakis scored a tie with bush among men 
after a 12point bush lead sunday 
dukakis improved with independents scoring 4842 against bush 
after a 5235 lead for bush among independents sunday and 59 
percent of democrats who had bolted the party to vote for president 
reagan favored dukakis now 
in another measure of the conventions impact 52 percent said 
the democrats could be trusted to do a better job with the nations 
problems up 9 points from sunday and 40 percent said they 
generally approved of the proceedings in atlanta while just 13 
percent disapproved 
nearly half said they had not been paying enough attention to

harry ellis dickson a renowned conductor and 
fatherinlaw of michael dukakis led the democratic convention 
orchestra in a new musical fanfare composed by boston pops 
conductor john williams as a dramatic prelude to the nominees 
acceptance speech 
dickson 79 associate conductor laureate of the boston pops 
orchestra and father of dukakis wife kitty said he was 
apprehensive before the thursday night premiere of fanfare for 
michael 
im basically a pessimist he said in an interview before 
the threeminute work was performed for the delegates and a 
national television audience i keep thinking the worst things in 
the world i keep thinking ill wake up in a few hours and find out 
that its all a dream 
dickson a violinist with the boston symphony orchestra for a 
halfcentury said he has the same apprehensions about the dukakis 
campaign 
i facetiously asked mike last week mike ive been telling 
people that my dream is to conduct the presidential inaugural 
concert do you mind if i write to george bush and ask him if hes 
elected can i still conduct mike laughed and said i wouldnt 
do it yet 
dickson who still conducts the boston pops on a parttime 
basis said the new work was conceived several weeks ago when he 
jokingly asked his friend williams to write a fanfare for his 
soninlaws nomination williams immediately agreed 
the oscarwinning composer who took over the boston pops from 
the late arthur fiedler in 1980 is a great fan of michaels 
dickson said 
williams said from los angeles its a ceremonial piece 
introducing gov dukakis i hope its suitably celebratory and 
magisterial and in the spirit to match the moment 
its a very dignified stirring fanfare with a sort of 
pompous beginning but it has a nice middle part for strings and 
woodwinds and then it finishes with the whole orchestra dickson 
said 
dickson said the convention appearance reminds him of another 
personal performance 
when kitty graduated from high school her class came to a 
pops concert in boston that i was conducting he said we found 
a piece called the waltzing cat we had a big sign put up 
that said the waltzing kitty i think that was about as personal 
as you could ever get i was going to bring it here but then i 
thought better not

lloyd bentsen cast in the role of 
conservative on the new democratic ticket has decided not to bury 
his differences with the more liberal michael dukakis but to 
praise them 
before millions of americans who watched thursdays convention 
on primetime television the texas senator served notice that he 
does not believe democrats must march in lockstep to win the 
white house 
his speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential 
nominee and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by 
dukakis oratory but bentsen had his own way of telling his party 
he balances the ticket nicely 
democrats he said are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland 
porridge of privilege we have differences of opinion but on 
the basic issues of justice and opportunity we stand united 
if the party does not expect great things of bentsens rhetoric 
it does expect great things of him in november the senator whose 
name has been described as magic in the state of texas was 
picked for the ticket to win his home state and its 29 electoral 
votes for the democrats 
the dukakisbentsen camp has also made it clear bentsen will 
spend a good deal of time in the south which has been reaganbush 
territory of late 
bentsen and his aides have stressed those issues on which he and 
dukakis agree economic growth jobs creation womens rights and 
better housing health care and education for all citizens 
but bentsen is more conservative than dukakis and many democrats 
on many issues including his support of school prayer the contra 
rebels in nicaragua and his opposition to gun control 
still the quietspoken senator who has a vaguely patrician 
air had plenty of supporters thursday night 
dukakis in his own remarks paid tribute to bentsen saying he 
would speak up if the national security council came up with the 
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for 
hostages 
rep dan rostenkowski dill who nominated bentsen and works 
with him closely on capitol hill called him straightforward 
smart and tough 
he is a sensible reasonable rational commonsense good 
choice for vice president of the united states said former rep 
barbara jordan of texas i believe that he is the best choice you 
could come up with to give us a strong and winning ticket this 
november 
bentsen also won praise from jesse jackson for his longtime 
support of civil rights on thursday just as bentsens name was 
being entered in nomination jackson issued a written endorsement 
of the senator 
while i may disagree with both governor dukakis and senator 
bentsen on some important issues our interests converge in 
building a coalition to beat the republicans this fall jackson 
said 
still when the voice vote was taken to acclaim bentsen the 
nominee many jackson supporters shouted no voicing their 
continued displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the 
ticket fifteen members of bentsens texas delegation refused to 
join in the celebration signs reading no contra aid were 
sprinkled through the convention hall 
bentsens own speech drew loud and sustained applause only when 
he mentioned dukakis but the senator was unruffled 
just wonderful really excited he beamed as he left the 
podium with dukakis to attend a round of postconvention parties

firefighter tim moyles tried to 
save a home but wound up on a hot seat literally when his 
pumper truck roared out from beneath a firestorm 
ive never felt anything like it ive never been that hot 
moyles said thursday as firefighters got the upper hand on twin 
blazes that have burned 12500 acres in rural calaveras county 
crews hope to contain them tonight 
moyles 27 and three other members of a california department 
of forestry pumper truck crew sped out of a crashing wave of flame 
that swallowed a home near this old goldmining town 150 miles 
east of san francisco 
moyles jumped on the open back of the truck and pulled a 
heatresistant blanket over himself but the ovenlike temperatures 
melted the vinyl seat under him into lumpy rivulets surrounded by 
blisters 
when you pull the cover over you cant see anything i didnt 
know what was happening he said my main concern was just to 
make sure i didnt fall off the back of the truck 
arson is suspected as the cause of the blazes that began tuesday 
and have razed six houses authorities estimate losses and the cost 
of fighting the fires at 43 million 
in wyoming firefighters made progress on a wildfire covering 
more than 17000 acres in the bridgerteton national forest and 
crews in oregon fought a 150acre blaze out of control in the 
umatilla national forest 
the calaveras flareup was typical for this summers fastmoving 
blazes that have thrown flaming debris far ahead of them in rugged 
droughtparched terrain thick with timber and brush 
moyles and dan miller the 34yearold captain of cdf engine no 
4481 of valley springs were chasing spot fires on a ridge when 
they saw gas ignite from a propane tank next to the home a 
quartermile away a pumper crewed by volunteers fled out of water 
i saw the structure was still standing so we went down to 
save it said miller who lives in angels camp but just after 
we got there the house exploded into flames 
the wind shifted and the fire blew down on us he added 
miller shouted at his crew to board and they roared down the 
road as the wind turned the flames into a furnace said moyles 
we were a little concerned about tim on the back on the 
truck but moyles was unhurt when they pulled over a few hundred 
yards away at a wide spot in the road miller said 
if we had stalled wed have lost the engine he said i 
thought we would have real burn damage to the engine but i guess 
we didnt stay long enough 
a couple of engines have gotten so hot the insignia seals 
and paint have peeled he said 
russ hasemeier 22 the third member of the crew jumped into 
the cab with miller 
i never guessed a structure could go up like that hasemeier 
said 
the crew took refuge in a large barren area cleared by a 
bulldozer the firefighters waited while the fires swept past 
feeling safe by comparison with their earlier scrape 
when miller got on the radio word of the escape spread like 
wildfire when something goes out on the air everybody finds 
out he said 
the fourth member of the crew who was off when the fire started 
tuesday and has since joined his comrades was disappointed 
i missed all the real good fireworks frederick lewis said

a series of afghan rebel victories 
and a steady barrage of rocket attacks on the afghan capital have 
led soviet troops to take the lead in defending kabul western 
diplomats say 
the soviet move raises new doubts that president najibs marxist 
government can survive after moscow withdraws its more than 100000 
troops from afghanistan the diplomats said thursday 
the rocket strikes this week suggest rebel supplies have 
improved and their commanders around the city are better 
coordinated said the diplomats who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
they quoted one unconfirmed report as saying 4000 afghan 
guerrillas have massed on the western edge of the capital and said 
fighting was reported on all fronts around kabul 
soviet forces already provide most of kabuls air and artillery 
defense but soviet troops now are moving to the capitals 
perimeter to battle rebels the diplomats said 
they said soviet troops were sent to kargha three miles west of 
kabul after afghan troops suffered setbacks they gave no details 
the soviet and afghan governments maintain that the withdrawing 
soviets are letting afghan troops take the lead in fighting the 
civil war 
red army troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
government fight usbacked moslem guerrillas the soviet union 
agreed in april to withdraw its troops and the withdrawal began in 
may 
rockets blasted the capital tuesday and wednesday official 
radio kabul reported 15 people killed tuesday and diplomats put 
the toll at 17 casualty figures for wednesdays attack were not 
provided 
radio kabul quoted afghanistans official bakhtar news agency as 
saying shells hit residential areas of the countrys eastern city 
of jalalabad thursday the broadcast said five people were killed 
official soviet and afghan media blame the rocket attacks on 
afghan guerrillas 
abdul haq believed to be the strongest guerrilla commander in 
the capital area said residential areas are not targeted but 
acknowledged some rockets go astray 
haq also said soviet and afghan forces were rocketing the 
capital in an effort to discredit the rebels and turn the 
population against them 
since the soviet pullout started radio kabul says almost 200 
rockets have slammed into afghan cities 
elsewhere in afghanistan 12 guerrillas and a norwegian relief 
worker were killed wednesday night when their vehicle hit a mine 
close to the pakistan border the norwegian news agency ntb 
reported thursday in oslo 
under the unbrokered troop withdrawal accord half of the red 
army troops are to be gone by aug 15 and complete withdrawal is 
scheduled by feb 15 1989 
full soviet withdrawal would leave about 50000 government 
troops fighting an estimated 200000 rebels

both sides in the wedtech corruption trial found 
a rare point of agreement when a federal prosecutor shocked the 
courtroom by calling his boss outgoing us attorney general edwin 
meese a sleaze 
the justice department response thursday was swift and angry in 
calling for an inhouse investigation meeses lawyer branded the 
remark as beneath contempt 
assistant us attorney edward j little stunned spectators at 
the racketeering trial of rep mario biaggi dny and six others 
thursday when he brought up the sleaze factor adding in effect 
that it didnt matter 
these defendants cant get out of this case by pointing 
fingers at meese so what who cares thats got nothing to do with 
what happened in this courtroom said little 
biaggi and his codefendants are charged with turning wedtech 
corp a nowbankrupt defense contractor into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid millions of dollars in bribes for government 
contracts and other favors 
the defense has maintained during the fourmonth trial that 
corrupt wedtech executives who testified for the government had 
links to white house insiders like meese and did not need to bribe 
biaggi 
the softspoken little said the answer to this meese defense 
was meese was a sleaze too also in addition to these 
people he also denied defense hints that prosecutors were 
shielding ed meese our boss 
littles remarks came near the end of his final argument to the 
federal jury in manhattan 
dominic amorosa the first defense attorney to sum up said he 
was glad the government has conceded what we have been saying 
meese is a sleaze indeed he is and indeed he was 
final defense arguments were expected to continue into next week 
meese attorney nathan lewin said littles comment was beneath 
contempt its ridiculous to make a statement like that to even 
as a matter of prosecution strategy group the attorney general 
with these people is beneath contempt 
in washington justice department spokesman patrick korten said 
we have asked the us attorneys office in new york to check to 
see whether mr little is quoted accurately if such remarks were 
made we would consider them to be inappropriate unprofessional 
and not least flatly wrong 
korten declined to comment on whether little might be subject to 
disciplinary action saying the first thing we want to do is 
determine precisely what he said 
meese has been under scrutiny for some time because of his 
wedtech connections but a special prosecutor in washington james 
c mckay determined there was insufficient evidence to charge 
meese with wrongdoing however mckay questioned the attorney 
generals ethics on several issues 
meese claiming he was vindicated by the mckay report has 
announced he will leave office later this summer 
us district judge constance baker motley denied a defense 
request during the trial to call meese as a witness saying his 
actions had nothing to do with the guilt or innocence of those on 
trial 
three men including meeses former personal lawyer e robert 
wallach and his exfinancial adviser w franklyn chinn are to go 
on trial jan 3 for allegedly extracting payoffs from wedtech to 
influence meese and others 
meanwhile the california state bar said wednesday it is 
investigating wallachs activities involving wedtech and meese as 
well as meese himself 
the mckay report released monday found that in 1981 wallach 
asked meese then white house counsel to help wedtech known as 
welbilt at the time obtain a government contract however the 
report found insufficient evidence to indict meese on bribery 
charges 
the wedtech defendants include wedtech founder john mariotta 
former bronx borough president stanley simon peter neglia 
onetime regional head of the small business administration and 
biaggis eldest son richard

it was vintage michael dukakis talk of good 
jobs at good wages a vow to wage a real war not a phony war 
on drugs a little bit of spanish and from the tribute to his 
immigrant parents to hopes for a grandchild yet unborn a paean to 
the american dream 
but it was also the speech of dukakis life 
lines he has uttered hundreds of times before tens of thousands 
of people from an airport hangar in harlingen texas to the 
golddomed statehouse in boston took on new vibrancy thursday 
night in the stirring 45minute address with which he accepted the 
democratic nomination for president 
it was his first extended opportunity to speak on television to 
the millions of americans whose votes he seeks he hit every note 
the crowd in the omni gasped with delight when he broke into 
spanish in tribute to the late hispanic organizer willie velasquez 
never mind that this polyglot politician parades his flawless 
spanish every chance he gets it was as if he were doing it for the 
very first time 
he spoke of the american dream as every candidate does but it 
did not sound hackneyed when he said im a product of that 
dream 
he choked up as he recalled his greek father who arrived at 
ellis island with only 25 in his pocket 
he spoke as he always does of creating good jobs at good 
wages for every citizen in this land 
he said the election isnt about ideology its about 
competence its not about insider trading on wall street its 
about creating opportunity on main street 
he reclaimed john winthrop for the democrats quoting not the 
city upon a hill line that is one of ronald reagans favorites 
but another passage from the first governor of massachusetts about 
the need to knit together as one 
like reagan he offered a pantheon of latterday heroes dawn 
lawson who went from the welfare rolls to a fortune 500 company 
bill kraus a catholic priest in denver finding jobs for the 
homeless george mckenna grooming minority students from los 
angeles innercity george washington prep for college 
dukakis speaking style and message have another feature in 
common with reagan a spirit of neversaydie optimism an 
unapologetic resolute belief that were going to forge a new era 
of greatness for america 
he offered a salute to reagan for cuts in nuclear arms and the 
delegates applauded somewhat reluctantly 
he offered a slap at reagan by promising not to pardon those who 
sell arms to the ayatollah and they roared 
and he gave george bush enough of a shove to set off a 
fullthroated reprise of the where was george chorus that 
teddy kennedy and tony coelho started tuesday he said his vice 
president would put a stop to any cockamanie idea such as 
trading arms for hostages 
for those who wondered how he would ever match the memorable 
oratory of jesse jackson dukakis had a surprise 
he paid tribute not just to the man he vanquished but to his 
children those fine handsome and proud and articulate jackson 
children who had their own moment on the stage earlier in the 
convention 
he finished with a flurry of references to children to young 
jacqueline jackson to ann richards nearly perfect 
granddaughter lily and to his own first grandchild due on 
inauguration day 
he invoked the memory of the oath the citizens of athens took to 
leave their country greater better stronger prouder and more 
beautiful than it was transmitted to us 
it was a speech containing very little new yet full of 
surprises none more surprising than the simple eloquence with 
which the candidate rose to the occasion

in new york overnight the dollar closed in tokyo at 13208 yen 
down 142 yen from thursdays close the us currency had opened 
at 13185 yen and moved in a range of 1316313220 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the most widely 
followed barometer on the exchange lost 39113 points or 141 
percent to close at 2728501 
the volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 17 
billion shares 
a bank of japan official attributed the dollars sharp decline 
to the impact of cooperative intervention by central banks 
according to kyodo news service 
exchange dealers said the dollars downturn was the direct 
result of the drop in new york 
i dont see any outstanding factor which could depreciate the 
dollar said a dealer at a major us investment bank in tokyo 
other dealers said investment banks sold the dollar heavily this 
morning as a result of the overnight decline and that caused the 
dollars sharp drop in tokyo 
the dollar regained the 132yen level in late morning when news 
reports quoted finance minister kiichi miyazawa as saying the yens 
sudden appreciation was not significant 
stock brokers attributed the decline in share prices to an 
overnight decline on wall street where the dow jones industrial 
average fell by more than 24 points 
furthermore concern over higher interest rates sidelined many 
investors brokers said

israels arab enemies 
have a combined air force almost as large as natos and the threat 
is growing with the prospect of an end to the iraniraq war 
israels air force commander says 
maj gen avihu binnun said israels air force was investing 
heavily in pilot training new tactics and technology to meet the 
challenge of an unprecedented arab arms buildup 
we are trying to keep the qualitative edge but when you look 
at the numbers it gets more and more difficult all the time 
binnun told reporters thursday at the hatzerim air force base in 
the southern negev desert 
but he added we believe we can cope even with the new 
technology the arab countries are getting from all over the world 
binnun said most of the billions of dollars arab countries have 
spent on weapons in recent years have gone toward beefing up their 
air power he said israel was especially concerned about the arms 
buildup in iraq syria and saudia arabia 
the number of fighters that can attack israel in 20 minutes of 
flight is more than 1500 he said 
the londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
says in its 198788 report that the arab countries most likely to 
engage in a war with israel have a combined force of 2358 combat 
aircraft compared to 676 in israel and 2409 in the north atlantic 
treaty organizations european deployment areas 
israel was very concerned about the recent 30 billion british 
arms sale to saudi arabia a country that has participated directly 
or indirectly in all wars against israel binnun said 
the package includes sophisticated tornado fighter planes whose 
range enables them to hit any israeli target from saudi arabia he 
said 
we must take into account that in case of war against israel 
the equipment either will be used by the saudis or sent over to one 
of the countries at war with us binnun said 
he said the agreement with britain did not bar the saudis from 
sending weapons to other countries 
in addition saudi arabia has transferred billions of dollars 
worth of arms purchased from the united states to iraq apparently 
without us approval he said 
with the prospect of a ceasefire in the iraniraq war the 
iraqi air force also has become a greater threat he said 
he said iraq has sophisticated fighter planes supplied by the 
french and soviets and has gained a great deal of experience during 
the 8yearold persian gulf war 
but binnun said the iraqis havent achieved what an air force 
of this size could have achieved after so many years of 
experience and that israel could cope with the threat 
the iranian air force poses no threat because it is small and 
poorly maintained said binnun 
another potential threat comes from syria one of israels most 
implacable enemies he said 
since israels 1982 invasion of lebanon syria has tripled the 
number of groundtoair missiles and today batteries of sam5 
missiles are aimed at all of israels air space he said 
if you fly over the southern part of israel above 20000 feet 
you are under the cover of the sam5s he said you can shoot 
down airplanes over here from syria 
in addition syria reportedly is buying m9 surfacetosurface 
missiles from china and according to israeli officials is 
developing chemical warheads 
we are taking the threat from syria very seriously binnun 
said but if we have to fight the syrians we will suprise them 
again 
he also vowed that israel would retaliate harshly against any 
missile attack during the 1973 middle east war for example syria 
aimed a missile at a northern israeli air force base but struck an 
israeli village instead he said 
the next morning 80 bombs hit general headquarters in the 
middle of damascus he said the air force is capable of 
hitting any target within any distance we proved it once and we 
hope we dont need to prove it again 
in another development binnun said israel hoped to sign a new 
contract with the united states soon for the purchase of additional 
f15 fighter planes he would not elaborate

the ruling sandinistas say the 
election of a guerrilla military leader to a key political role in 
the rebel movement will jeopardize prospects for negotiating a 
permanent peace 
a sandinista army officer meanwhile said 34 rebels were killed 
during a series of attacks by guerrillas earlier this week 
the election on monday of col enrique bermudez to the political 
directorate of the rebels nicaraguan resistance umbrella 
organization makes the possibility of negotiating peace even more 
remote the sandinista national liberation fronts newspaper 
barricada said in an editorial 
bermudez was elected by rebel delegates to a meeting in the 
dominican republic his election removes the civilian mask from 
the usbacked contra movement barricada says 
bermudez commander of the main rebel army known as the 
nicaraguan democratic force was a colonel in the national guard of 
the rightwing somoza dynasty that ruled nicaragua for 42 years 
until it was overthrown by the leftist sandinistas in july 1979 
barricada said bermudezs election ratified the somoza 
leadership in the rebel movement 
maj ramon caldera chief of the general staff for the fifth 
military region said government troops under his command repelled 
rebel attacks tuesday that were intended to disrupt celebrations 
marking the ninth anniversary of the sandinista regime he said 34 
contras were killed 
caldera also said the contras were secretly supplied with 
weapons in four airdrops in northeastern nueva guinea province 
during the first 15 days of july 
caldera made his remarks at a ceremony marking the discharge of 
12000 government troops from active service he gave no details on 
the attacks in central chontales province and northern boaca 
province and did not mention government casualties

a contra group attacked an army patrol in buenos aires about 148 
miles north of the capital it said contras kidnapped six civilians 
in the northern part of the country on sunday and tuesday 
the statement which gave no details also said six rebels 
deserted to sandinista forces this week 
a ceasefire has been in effect since march 21 in the 7yearold 
war between the sandinista government and the contras each side 
has accused the other of violating the truce 
president daniel ortega on tuesday announced a unilateral 
government extension of the ceasefire to aug 30 it had been set 
to expire at the end of this month

contra leaders still may be able to negotiate with 
seven field commanders who resigned to protest the growing power of 
a hardline military leader a spokesman says 
there is no crisis bosco matamoros spokesman for 
nicaraguan resistance the contra umbrella group said thursday 
we had a generational change within our forces 
the seven commanders abandoned their southern front commands 
tuesday after the election of enrique bermudez who was already 
the rebel military chief to the contra ruling body in may 
bermudez forced out five major northern front military officials 
who had demanded his resignation 
the seven commanders denounced the election of bermudez in 
nicaragua as an attempt by the extreme right to gain control of 
the contra movement 
the commanders have the right to express their opinion 
matamoros said our organization is composed of volunteers 
but the resignations may not be final he added 
we will talk to them and see if they will reconsider said 
matamoros 
he claimed the dissidents command only a few hundred troops 
but the seven commanders some of whom were important enough to 
participate directly in recent peace talks with the sandinistas 
say they represent all 2700 rebel fighters on nicaraguas southern 
front along the costa rican border 
like dissidents before them on the northern front based in 
honduras the southern commanders attacked bermudez for corruption 
inefficiency and his close links to the hated national guard of 
deposed dictator anastasio somoza debayle bermudez was a colonel 
in the guard before somoza was overthrown by the sandinistas in 
1979 
they also complained their troops are not receiving us 
humanitarian aid unlike bermudezs forces from the beginning the 
southern front guerrillas have received but a fraction of the us 
aid given the larger better known northern front contra army 
matamoris said the newly elected sevenmember directorate has 
not issued any statements about the dissidents 
the split is only the latest in a growing rift among contra 
leaders and military commanders one issue is the peace talks with 
the sandinistas which the dissidents accuse bermudez of trying to 
sabotage 
pedro joaquin chamorro formerly the most liberal of the 
directors and a spokesman for the dissidents was dumped from the 
ruling body during the contra assembly meeting in the dominican 
republic last weekend

here are excerpts from the speech by 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis to the democratic national 
convention on thursday night accepting the partys nomination for 
president 
tonight as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and now 
with lisa our lovely daughterinlaw four terrific children as a 
proud public servant who has cherished every minute of the last 16 
months on the campaign trail i accept your nomination for the 
presidency of the united states 
my friends the dream that carried me to this platform is alive 
tonight in every part of our country and its what the democratic 
party is all about 
its time to meet the challenge of the next american frontier 
the challenge of building an economic future for our country that 
will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen in this land 
no matter who they are or where they come from or what the color of 
their skin 
its time to rekindle the american spirit of invention and of 
daring to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics to build 
the best america by bringing out the best in every american 
its time to wake up to the new challenges that face the 
american family 
i dont think i have to tell any of you how much we americans 
expect of ourselves 
or how much we have a right to expect from those we elect to 
public office 
because this election is not about ideology its about 
competence 
its not about overthrowing governments in central america its 
about creating jobs in middle america thats what this election is 
all about 
its not about insider trading on wall street its about 
creating opportunity on main street 
and its not about meaningless labels its about american 
values oldfashioned values like accountability and responsibility 
and respect for the truth 
and just as we democrats believe that there are no limits to 
what each citizen can do so we believe that there are no limits to 
what america can do 
and im very proud of our progress but im even prouder of the 
way weve made that progress by working together by excluding no 
one and including everyone business and labor educators and 
community leaders and just plain citizens sharing responsibility 
exchanging ideas building confidence about the future 
and my friends what we have done reflects a simple but very 
profound idea an idea as powerful as any in human history 
it is the idea of community it is the idea of community the 
kind of community that binds us here tonight 
it is the idea that we are in this together that regardless of 
who we are or where we come from or how much money we have each 
of us counts and that by working together to create opportunity 
and a good life for all all of us are enriched not just in 
economic terms but as citizens and as human beings 
and as i accept your nomination tonight i cant help recalling 
that the first marathon was run in ancient greece and that on 
importan occasions like this one the people of athens would 
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge 
that pledge that covenant is as eloquent and as timely today 
as it was 2000 years ago 
we will never bring disgrace to this our country we will 
never bring disgrace to this our country by any act of dishonesty 
or of cowardice we will fight for the ideals of this our country 
we will revere and obey the law we will strive to quicken our 
sense of civic duty thus in all these ways we will transmit this 
country greater stronger prouder and more beautiful than it was 
transmitted to us 
that is my pledge to you my fellow democrats 
and that is my pledge to you my fellow americans

south korean political leaders said 
today they would try to respond positively to a north korean call 
for talks on a nonaggression pact between the two bitter rivals 
leaders of the souths four main political parties said they 
would cooperate with each other to produce a united response by the 
end of next week that could clear the way for talks 
we will make efforts to seek an early realization of 
interkorea parliamentary talks said opposition leader kim 
daejung 
communist north korea sent an invitation thursday to the south 
korean national assembly for talks with the supreme peoples 
assembly in pyongyang on a nonaggression pact drawn up by the 
communist north 
south korean government and opposition leaders said preliminary 
negotiations would be needed to work out the terms and details 
before any agreement could be reached on parliamentary talks 
kim opposition leaders kim youngsam and kim jongpil and 
government democratic justice party chairman yoon giljoong said 
they would try to use the norths proposals to promote contacts to 
ease tension on the divided peninsula 
south korean defense minister oh jabok warned senior commanders 
today that the north had substantial military superiority over the 
south and its forces were poised for a lightning attack 
the north korean proposal received modest coverage in the south 
korean media many observers said the proposal did not appear to be 
a major new development 
the rival koreas have presented a series of proposals in recent 
months to ease tension and establish peace on the divided 
peninsula but each side has tended to ignore the others 
proposals insisting its plans be followed 
talks between parliamentary delegations on a nonaggression pact 
collapsed in 1986 when north korea pulled out to protest routine 
ussouth korean military exercises similar efforts in the early 
1970s also failed to make any progress 
a government spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
talks between the rival governments should be held at the same time 
as the parliamentary talks he said any decision on a pact by the 
south would be taken by the seoul administration 
south korean insistence on intergovernment talks could block 
the parliamentary talks since north korea has been refusing to 
deal with the seoul government both governments claim they are the 
sole legitimate government of korea 
north korea refused to accept letters earlier this month from 
the seoul government calling for political economic and 
humanitarian talks on easing relations south korean president roh 
taewoo called for a major peace effort but the north refused to 
accept the letter outlining the proposal 
north korea has been insisting for months it wants to deal 
directly with the people in the south and has continued to 
denounce the seoul government as a usbacked puppet regime it 
apparently sent a letter to the national assembly for this reason 
the south korean government and the oppositiondominated 
national assembly agree any talks with the north must be under the 
administrations direction any north korean delegation at peace 
talks would be under direct government control because the norths 
assembly is a powerless rubberstamp body 
south korean political parties all support peaceful 
reunification but also fear the north remains determined to extend 
communist rule over the peninsula 
political leaders in seoul expressed concern north korea did not 
respond to the national assemblys call to take part in the 1988 
olympic games in seoul the north korean proposal was in response 
to the assemblys call for pyongyang not to boycott the games 
north korea has been demanding to cohost the olympics but 
international olympic officials said the games can only be awarded 
to a single city 
the korean peninsula was divided by us and soviet forces that 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii efforts 
to reunite the peninsula failed and separate governments were 
declared in 1948 
the communist north invaded the south in 1950 to start the 
korean war about 42000 us troops are based in the south under a 
mutual defense treaty

it wasnt a minute after the gavel fell on the 
democratic national convention that delegates began scrambling for 
souvenirs barely ahead of the demolition crew hired to haul the 1 
million podium off to the dump 
some delegates like sharon mast a school teacher from 
bellevue wash even coveted the confetti that had rained down on 
her head a few moments earlier 
this isnt confetti at all said the dukakis delegate as she 
scooped up a handful of the tiny red blue and silver pieces into 
an envelope this is magic fairy dust that will help us defeat 
bush this fall it really wont take very much 
hundreds of the 5000 delegates and alternates in the omni left 
the coliseum carrying bags bulging with prizes they had picked up 
some had bunches of balloons others waved large aluminum and 
cardboard replicas of the greek flag 
alvin chambliss jr a jackson delegate from oxford miss 
walked out clutching his bentsen no sign theres no way im 
going to leave this behind he said 
some delegates were still searching for souvenirs when the first 
members of the breakdown crew arrived 30 minutes after the 
conventions close 
now the fun begins said frank taylor one of several atampt 
technicians who were dismantling the computer voting terminals 
scattered about the convention floor 
soon a small army of laborers and technicians was pulling down 
the light and sound systems stacking chairs ripping up the carpet 
and using crowbars on the 1 million moveable podium from which 
democratic nominee dukakis had addressed the delegates just an hour 
before 
well salvage the elevator and some of the other parts then 
well haul the rest off to the landfill said william pug 
mabry a general superintendent for flagler construction co which 
helped construct the convention set 
he said the work crews had 12 hours to remove the chairs rip up 
the carpet and temporary floor beneath it and then take out 50 
miles of cables beneath the floor 
in 12 hours there will be cranes in here pulling down the tv 
network anchor booths which then will be taken to new orleans for 
the republican convention next month 
in addition to the cable beneath the floor the sound and 
lighting crew had to remove some 500 lights and 15 miles of cable 
above the floor 
i know that sounds like a lot but we had even more lights up 
there for the pink floyd concert here a couple of months ago 
said chuck adams a spotlight technician 
mike oshust director of operations for the omni coliseum said 
the work crews in addition to removing 2000 portable chairs also 
had to reinstall 5500 fixed seats that were removed so the 
democrats could install their huge pink blue and gray podium 
it took us six weeks to put up the podium but well have it 
completely torn down within eight days he said 
weve got to work fast because weve got another show coming 
in on the 29th

intravenous drug abusers have replaced 
homosexuals as the chief risk group for contracting hepatitis b 
federal health officials said suggesting national efforts to 
vaccinate them have failed 
the centers for disease control reported thursday that its 
ongoing study of hepatitis has found a striking increase in 
hepatitis b among iv drug abusers and a decrease among homosexuals 
that was likely produced by fear of aids 
miriam alter the cdcs chief of hepatitis surveillance said 
she could not explain the increase among drug abusers no reason 
has been found other than the fact that apparently theyre not 
changing their behavior she said 
hepatitis an inflammation of the liver caused by one of several 
viruses is contagious and can be fatal hepatitis b tends to be 
more severe than hepatitis a and is a more serious problem for 
health officials because hepatitis b patients can become lifetime 
carriers of the infection 
since 1985 drug abuse has surpassed homosexual activity as the 
chief risk factor for hepatitis b infection the cdc said in its 
weekly report 
the drop in homosexual cases is most likely a result of 
modification of highrisk sexual behavior prompted by the fear of 
aids the atlantabased health agency said 
even though a vaccine has been available for six years the cdc 
said there has been a steady increase in hepatitis b cases 
nationwide over the last decade the united states has about 
300000 infections per year now compared with 200000 per year in 
the late 1970s alter said adding that exact figures are 
unavailable because only a small percentage of cases are reported 
she suggested that efforts to vaccinate highrisk groups against 
hepatitis b have failed because of the difficulty in identifying 
highrisk people and because the vaccine must be administered in 
three doses over six months 
its hard to find them and to get them to come back for all 
three doses she said 
the cdc report cited another possible reasons for the failure of 
vaccination efforts many patients are already infected by the time 
they are identified as belonging to a risk group 
failure to overcome these obstacles will necessitate 
consideration of a broader immunization strategy the cdc said 
such a strategy could include routine hepatitis immunizations 
for children or adolescents alter said although the cdc is not 
yet recommending any particular strategy 
we want to make people aware that the current strategy is not 
working and to make people think about possible alternative 
strategies that may become necessary she said 
the cdcs hepatitis study begun in 1982 monitors four counties 
denver county colo jefferson county ala pierce county 
wash and pinellas county fla to determine trends in hepatitis 
infection 
the cdc said drug abusers accounted for 28 percent of the 
hepatitis b cases in the four counties in 1987 up from 15 percent 
in 1982 by contrast the percentage of homosexual cases dropped 
from 20 percent in 1982 to 9 percent in 1987 
hepatitis can be transmitted through sexual contact sharing of 
iv needles frequent contact with blood in the health professions 
household contact with a carrier blood transfusions dialysis and 
residency in an institution for the developmentally disabled 
more than 30 percent of the cases have no known source the cdc 
said

here is a transcript of the speech by 
massachusetts gov michael s dukakis to the democratic national 
convention as he accepted the partys presidential nomination 
a few months ago when olympia dukakis in front of about a 
billionandahalf television viewers all over the world raised 
that oscar over her head and said ok michael lets go she 
wasnt kidding 
and kitty and i are grateful to her for that wonderful 
introduction and grateful to all of you for making this possible 
this is a wonderful evening for us and we thank you from the 
bottom of our hearts 
my fellow democrats my fellow americans 
sixteen months ago when i announced my candidacy for the 
presidency of the united states i said this campaign would be a 
marathon 
tonight with the wind at our backs with friends at our sides 
and with courage in our hearts the race to the finish line begins 
and were going to win this race were going to win this race 
were going to win because we are the party that believes in the 
american dream 
a dream so powerful that no distance of ground no expanse of 
ocean no barrier of language no distinction of race or creed or 
color can weaken its hold on the human heart 
and i know because my friends im a product of that dream 
and im proud of it 
a dream that brought my father to this country 76 years ago 
that brought mother and her family here one year later poor 
unable to speak english but with a burning desire to succeed in 
their new land of opportunity 
and tonight in the presence of that marvelous woman who is my 
mother and who came here 75 years ago with the memory in my heart 
of the young man who arrived at ellis island with only 25 in his 
pocket but with a deep and abiding faith in the promise of america 
and how i wish he was here tonight he would be very proud of his 
son 
and hed be very proud of his adopted country i can assure you 
tonight as a son of immigrants with a wonderful wife and now 
with lisa our lovely daughterinlaw four terrific children as a 
proud public servant who has cherished every minute of the last 16 
months on the campaign trail i accept your nomination for the

tonight in every part of our country and its what the democratic 
party is all about 
henry cisneros of texas bob matsui of california barbara 
mikulski of maryland mario cuomo of new york claude pepper of 
florida and jesse louis jackson 
a man who has lifted so many hearts with the dignity and the 
hope of his message throughout this campaign a man whose very 
candidacy has said to every child aim high to every citizen 
you count to every voter you can make a difference to every 
american you are a full shareholder in our dream 
and my friends if anyone tells you that the american dream 
belongs to the privileged few and not to all of us you tell them 
that the reagan era is over you tell that the reagan era is over 
and that a new era is about to begin 
because its time to raise our sights to look beyond the 
cramped ideals and the limited ambitions of the past eight years 
to recapture the spirit of energy and of confidence and of idealism 
that john kennedy and lyndon johnson inspired a generation ago 
its time to meet the challenge of the next american frontier 
the challenge of building an economic future for our countjthat 
will create good jobs at good wages for every citizen in this land 
no matter who they are or wre they come from or what the color of 
their skin

its time to rekindle the american spirit of invention and of 
daring to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics to build 
the best america by bringing out the best in every american 
its time to wake up to the new challenges that face the 
american family 
time to see that young families in this country are never again 
forced to choose between the jobs they need and the children they 
love time to be sure that parents are never again told that no 
matter how long they work or how hard their child tries a college 
education is a right they cant afford 
its time to ask why it is that we have run up more debt in this 
country in the last eight years than we did in the previous 200 
and to make sure it never happens again 
its time to understand that the greatest threat to our national 
security in this hemisphere is not the sandinistas its the 
avalanche of drugs that is pouring into this country and poisoning 
our kids 
i dont think i have to tell any of you how much we americans 
expect of ourselves 
or how much we have a right to expect from those we elect to 
public office 
because this election is not about ideology its about 
competence 
its not about overthrowing governments in central america its 
about creating jobs in middle america thats what this election is 
all about 
its not about insider trading on wall street its about 
creating opportunity on main street 
and its not about meaningless labels its about american 
values oldfashioned values like accountability and responsibility 
and respect for the truth 
and just as we democrats believe that there are no limits to 
what each citizen can do so we believe that there are no limits to 
what america can do 
and yes i know this fall were going to be hearing a lot of 
republican talk about how well some neighborhoods and some regions 
of this country are doing about how easy it is for some families 
to buy a home or to find child care or to pay their doctors bills 
or to send their children to college 
but my friends maintaining the status quo running in place 
standing still isnt good enough for america opportuniories the 
finest in the world and were going to make teaching a valued and 
honored profession once again in this country 
were going to light fires of innovation and enterprise from 
coast to coast and were going to give those on welfare the chance 
to lift themselves out of poverty to get the child care and the 
training they need the chance to step out into the bright sunshine 
of opportunity and of hope and of dignity

were going to invest in our urban neighborhoods and were 
going to work to revitalize small town and rural america were 
going to give our farm families a price they can live on and farm 
communities a future they can count on 
were going to build the kind of america that lloyd bentsen has 
been fighting for for the past 40 years the kind of america where 
hard work is rewarded where american goods and american 
workmanship are the best in the world the kind of america that 
provides american workers and their families with at least 60 days 
notice when a factory or a plant shuts down 
now i know i have a reputation for being a somewhat frugal 
man but let me state for the record that that snow blower is still 
in good working order even as it sits in our garage 
in nine years ive balanced nine more budgets than this 
administration has and ive just balanced a tenth and ive worked 
with the citizens of my state worked hard to create hundreds of 
thousands of new jobs and i mean good jobs jobs you can raise a 
family on jobs you can build a future on jobs you can count on 
and im very proud of our progress but im even prouder of the 
way weve made that progress by working together by excluding no 
one and including everyone business and labor educators and 
community leaders and just plain citizens sharing responsibility 
exchanging ideas building confidence about the future 
and my friends what we have done reflects a simple but very 
profound idea an idea as powerful as any in human history 
it is the idea of community it is the idea of community the 
kind of community that binds us here tonight 
it is the idea that we are in this together that regardless of 
who we are or where we come from or how much money we have each 
of us counts and that by working together to create opportunity 
and a good life for all all of us are enriched not just in 
economic terms but as citizens and as human beings 
the idea of community an idea that was planted in the new 
world by the first governor of massachusetts 
we must said john winthrop love one another with a pure 
heart fervently we must delight in each other make each others 
condition our own rejoice together mourn together and suffer 
togetherwe must he said be knit together as one be knit 
together as one 
now john winthrop wasnt talking about material success he was 
talking about a country where each of us asks not only whats in it 
for some of us but whats good and whats right for all of us

factories and to help rebuild their communities 
i want students and office workers and retired teachers to share 
with a neighbor the precious gift of literacy 
i want those of you who are bricklayers and carpenters and

the spirit that survived that terrible winter at valley forge and 
triumphed on the beaches at normandy the courage that looked 
khrushchev in the eye during the cuban missile crisis is as 
strong and as vibrant today as it has ever been 
we must be we are and we will be militarily strong 
but we must back that military strength with economic strength 
we must give the men and women of our armed forces weapons that 
work we must have a secretary of defense who will manage and not 
be managed by the pentagon and we must have a foreign policy 
that reflects the decency and the principles and the values of the 
american people 
president reagan has set the stage for deep cuts in nuclear arms

but we can do a lot more to stop the spread of nuclear and 
chemical arms in this world we can do a lot more to bring peace to 
central america and the middle east and we can and we will do a 
lot more to end apartheid in south africa 
john kennedy once said that america leads the world not 
just because we are the richest or the strongest or the most 
powerful but because we exert that leadership for the cause of 
freedom around the globe and because in his words we 
are moving on the road to peace 
yes we must always be prepared to defend our freedom 
but we must always remember that our greatest strength comes not 
from what we possess but from what we believe not from what we 
have but from who we are 
you know ive been asked many times over the past 16 months if 
i have one very special goal for these next four years something 
that reflects everything i stand for and believe in as an american 
and the answer to that question is yes i do 
my friends four years from now when our citizens walk along 
pennsylvania avenue in washington dc or when they see a picture 
of the white house on television i want them to be proud of their 
government i want them to be proud of a government that sets high 
standards not just for the american people but high standards for 
itself 
were going to have a justice department that isnt the 
laughingstock of the nation were going to have a justice 
department that understands what the word justice means 
were going to have nominees to the federal bench who are men 
and women of integrity and intelligence and who understand the 
constitution of the united states 
were going to have an environmental protection agency that is 
more interested in stopping pollution than in protecting the 
polluters 
were going to have a real war not a phony war against drugs 
and my friends we wont be doing business with drugrunning 
panamanian dictators any more 
were going to have a vice president who wont sit silently by 
when somebody at the national security council comes up with the 
cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for 
hostages 
were going to have a vice president named lloyd bentsen who 
will walk into the oval office and say mr president this is 
outrageous and its got to stop thats the kind of vice 
president were going to have 
and in the dukakis white house as in the dukakis state house 
if you accept the privilege of public service you had better 
understand the responsibilities of public service if you violate 
that trust youll be fired if you violate the law youll be 
prosecuted and if you sell arms to the ayatollah dont expect a 
pardon from the president of the united states 
monday night like millions of americans i laughed and was

but what stirred me most on monday was a grandmother talking 
about her nearly perfect granddaughter and what stirred me 
most on tuesday were those handsome and proud and articulate 
jackson children those jackson children talking about their hopes 
for the future of their country 
you know young jackie jackson goes to school in my state and 
last month she visited with me in the state house in boston shes 
a remarkable young woman and i know her parents are very very 
proud of her 
my thoughts tonight and my dreams for america are about ann 
richards granddaughter lily about young jackie jackson and about 
the baby thats going to be born to our son john and his wife lisa 
in january as a matter of fact the baby is due on or about jan 20 
god willing our first grandchild will reach the age that jackie 
jackson is now at the beginning of a new century and we pray that 
he or she will reach that age with eyes as filled with the sparkle 
of life and of pride and of optimism as that young woman we watched 
together two nights ago 
yes my friends its a time for wonderful new beginnings 
a little baby 
a new administration 
a new era of greatness for america 
and when we leave here tonight we will leave to build that 
future together 
to build that future so that when our children and our 
grandchildren look back in their time on what we did in our time 
they will say that we had the wisdom to carry on the dreams of 
those who came before us the courage to make our own dreams come 
true and the foresight to blaze a trail for generations yet to come 
and as i accept your nomination tonight i cant help recalling 
that the first marathon was run in ancient greece and that on 
important occasions like this one the people of athens would 
complete their ceremonies by taking a pledge 
that pledge that covenant is as eloquent and as timely today 
as it was 2000 years ago 
we will never bring disgrace to this our country we will 
never bring disgrace to this our country by any act of dishonesty 
or of cowardice we will fight for the ideals of this our country 
we will revere and obey the law we will strive to quicken our 
sense of civic duty thus in all these ways we will transmit this 
country greater stronger prouder and more beautiful than it was 
transmitted to us 
that is my pledge to you my fellow democrats 
and that is my pledge to you my fellow americans

here is a transcript of the speech by sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas to the democratic national convention as he 
accepted the partys vice presidential nomination 
thank you very much 
john glenn is one of the most talented respected figures in 
america and i thank him for a very gracious introduction 
and danny rostenkowski tom daschle barbara jordan mickey 
leland what great friends you are 
thank you very much 
and i thank you my fellow democrats for this high honor 
i am proud and pleased to accept your nomination for vice 
president of the united states of america 
in four months america will elect a new president 
and his name will be michael dukakis 
his theme will be economic opportunity for all his values will 
be honesty integrity and fairness and his party will be a united 
democratic party 
twentyeight years ago our party nominated a president from 
massachusetts and a vice president from texas the texan on that 
ticket was lyndon baines johnson lyndon johnson knew then what you 
and i know so well today the equality of opportunity is the 
ultimate civil right 
his vision and his victories paved the way for democratic 
leaders like rev jesse jackson whose eloquence whose leadership 
and achievements transcend pride of party and inspire a nation 
tonight the hopes of a nation the incredible energy and 
diversity of america are focused on atlanta this convention 
reflects that energy and diversity 
we are a mirror of america 
we democrats dont march in lockstep behind some narrow rigid 
ideology of indifference we are not gray grains of oatmeal in a 
bland porridge of privilege 
our way the democratic way is to tackle the tough problems 
our way is to search out the honest answers and stand by our 
principles 
of course we have differences of opinion but on the basic 
issues of justice and opportunity we stand united 
democrats agree that a good job at a fair wage is the passport 
to opportunity in america 
democrats agree that america needs a trade policy based on the 
simple premise of fairness we demand that nations selling goods 
freely into our country that we have full access to their markets 
democrats agree that the economic trade and energy policies of 
the reaganbush administration have devastated vast areas of 
america we see an agricultural economy that has been driven to its 
knees we see the energy economy reeling in crisis we see the loss 
of more than one million highpaying jobs in manufacturing 
democrats agree that the american worker who has struggled for 
20 years to support his or her family has earned 60 days noe when 
that management closes down a plant 
but the reaganbush administration thinks a pink slip in the 
mail is notice enough thats their notion of fairness thats 
their message to the working men and women of america

democrats want a strong national defense and we will pay the 
price to defend freedom but we also demand a careful accounting 
for our hardearned dollars and we will not tolerate the 
corruption and greed that threatens to undermine our military might 
democrats agree that decent housing a clean environment a good 
education and quality health care should be the birthright of 
every american citizen and not the private domain of a privileged 
few 
so make no mistake about it we are united in our commitment to 
do better for america 
my friends america has just passed through the ultimate epoch 
of illusion an eightyear coma in which slogans were confused with 
solutions and rhetoric passed for reality a time when america 
tried to borrow its way to prosperity and became the largest debtor 
nation in the history of mankind when the reaganbush 
administration gave lip service to progress while fighting a 
frantic losing battle to turn back the clock on civil rights and 
equal opportunity a time of tough talk on foreign policy and 
strange tales of doubledealing swiss bank accounts and a botched 
campaign against a drugrunning tinhorn dictator 
the reaganbush administration likes to talk about prosperity 
but the farmers in iowa dont hear them the oil field workers in 
texas and oklahoma and louisiana dont hear them the factory 
workers in john glenns ohio dont hear them 
my fellow democrats it is easy enough to create an illusion of 
prosperity all you have to do is write hot checks for 200 billion 
a year thats what the reaganbush administration has done thats 
how they doubled our national debt in just seven years 
at long last the epoch of illusion is drawing to a close 
america is ready for the honest proven handson realworld 
leadership of michael dukakis backed by the power of a united 
committed democratic party 
for 200 years america has worked better than any society in 
history a major reason for our success is that every generation of 
americans has acceptedpresponsibility to expand the frontiers of 
individual opportunity we have expanded that opportunity through 
universal education the homestead act landgrant colleges 
womens suffrage social security the gi bill civil rights and 
health care 
taken together and placed in the context of the free enterprise 
system these progressive actions made america the land of 
opportunity they created a magnet that drew millions of people 
from around the world to america people like michael dukakis 
father from greece like my grandfather from denmark like your 
relatives who came here willing to accept enormous risks and 
dangers in return for the chance for a step up in life

recently it has become more difficult for working americans to 
take that step up 
oh i see the charts and numbers that suggest prosperity but i 
also talk with those people and i hear what they say 
i know that if you are a teacher or a factory worker or if you 
are just starting a family its almost impossible to buy a house 
no matter how hard you work or how carefully you save 
a college education is slipping beyond the reach of millions of 
hardworking americans if you have a child thats born today plan 
on having 60000 in the bank when that child reaches the age of 18 
in the hopes of sending that child to a public university and if 
the republicans have their way you wont have any college loan 
program to help work it out for you 
when michael dukakis talks about the economics of opportunity 
he is talking about making our country work again hes talking 
about putting the american dream back in the reach of all the 
american people he is talking sense and america is listening 
michael dukakis understands the reality of america but even 
more important he understands the potential of america he turned 
around the economy of massachusetts not by writing hot checks but 
by careful planning careful management of the taxpayers dollar 
and a healthy respect for the entrepreneurial system 
when the nations governors were asked who among you is the 
most effective leader the answer was michael dukakis of 
massachusetts when millions of democrats went to the polls this 
year to choose the leader who will blaze americas path during the 
21st century they chose michael dukakis of massachusetts 
michael dukakis has the uncanny knack of bringing forth the very 
best in america he knows that government cant solve all our 
problems but he also understands that government has an obligation 
to lead 
michael dukakis and i will lead a government that cares about 
people about jobs about all regions of america about housing and 
the homeless about the defense of freedom about education and 
health care about justice and opportunity for all americans 
we believe america deserves an administration that will obey the 
law tell the truth and insist all who serve it do the same 
we believe the best way to lead america is by force of character 
and personal integrity 
this convention has been a triumph for michael dukakis and the 
democratic party it has certainly been a proud moment for me and 
for my family my wife ba my sons my daughter and their 
families are here tonight to share this honor with me 
my father is also here he is 94 years old proud of his 
country and proud of his son 
dad you have been telling the reporters stories about me 
lately so let me tell one about youpy father is a symbol of what 
people of courage and vision and daring can achieve in america

he has lived the american dream the dream we want to come true 
for our children 
talk about risktakers his family came to this country across 
the ocean across the prairie and homesteaded on the plains of 
south dakota when the government would bet you 160 acres that you 
couldnt make it through the winter 
they built a sod house and when that first blizzard blew in 
they took turns staying awake for 36 hours burning bundles of 
straw so they wouldnt freeze to death 
but like your ancestors they made it through the storm they 
made it through the winter they planted and harvested and 
eventually they prospered 
they made their way in america 
my father made his way to texas and ive made my way to atlanta 
with michael dukakis to stand before my family before a united 
democratic party before the american people to accept your 
nomination as vice president of the united states of america 
now thats the american dream that we have nourished and 
protected for 200 years the dream of freedom and opportunity the 
chance for a step up in life 
i want to help michael dukakis protect that dream for the next 
generation and i want to help michael dukakis maintain freedom as 
the most powerful and persuasive force on earth and i want to 
thank all of you for the opportunity to serve america 
thank you very much

health issues among gays and lesbians including 
concerns about high alcohol and drug dependency rates are on the 
agenda for 1500 people gathered here for the 10th national lesbian 
and gay health conference 
the fiveday conference and aids forum will provide participants 
with a knowledge of the needs of the lesbian and gay community 
ellen ratner president of the sponsoring national lesbian and gay 
health foundation said as the meeting began thursday 
one concern is drug dependency and alcoholism rates among 
lesbians and gays which are at least twice and probably thrice 
the national average said ratner the founder of new englands 
wollaston ii psychiatric day treatment center 
its probably because were forced to hide so much its hard 
for us to come to grips with ourselves and it forces us into 
closets ratner said and people who are in closets or theyre 
oppressed they drink they drug 
members of various organizations can make contacts during the 
conference and prominent members of the community will be honored 
she said 
among those to receive awards are rep barney frank and rep 
gerry studds two openly gay democratic congressmen from 
massachusetts sen edward m kennedy dmass is scheduled to 
address the conference monday 
events range from banquets and yoga exercises to more than 350 
diverse forums 
phil carsmel a member of australias national aids advisory 
council said he had attended the international conference on aids 
in stockholm last month and hoped to learn more about americas 
fight against acquired immune deficiency syndrome during the boston 
meeting 
aids which has no known cure is spread primarily through 
sexual contact or contaminated intravenous needles shared by drug 
abusers 
stockholm is the theories this conference is the practice 
said carsmel a melbourne resident this is where we translate 
the ideas into the real world 
susanne morgan a sociology professor at ithaca college in new 
york said she attended the conference to meet other educators and 
to learn about new materials she could use for presentations to 
student lesbian and gay groups she advises 
i want to do some networking morgan said i want to meet 
people doing work among campuses 
when the first conference was held in washington in 1978 fewer 
than 200 people attended 
the swelling numbers tell us there are a lot of people 
concerned that there are a lot of people that want to continue to 
learn that this is a community that needs to network with each 
other ratner said were a community thats really starting to 
come together 
meanwhile the us embassy in nicaragua denied visas to three 
members of that countrys health ministry who had planned to attend 
the conference 
ratner said the three were members of a technical advisory team 
on aids the visa denial she said denied us and the world 
the value of their knowledge and experience 
the visa refusals were based on concerns that the three 
officials might not return to nicaragua state department spokesman 
ben justenfen said

a moderate earthquake hit anchorage and 
its outskirts but there were no reports of damage officials at 
the tsunami warning center of the national weather service reported 
the temblor registered 46 on the openended scale at just 
before midnight thursday and was centered about 30 miles north of 
anchorage said wayne jorgensen of the quake observatory 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 
times stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in a local area 4 can cause moderate damage an 8 reading 
is a great quake capable of tremendous damage 
the 1964 alaska quake that killed 131 people measured 84 on the 
richter scale while the san francisco earthquake of 1906 has been 
estimated at 83

jesse jacksons democrats are leaving atlanta 
divided on the question of unity with many warning that they need 
time to heal their disappointment before they can judge michael 
dukakis 
its much too early in the campaign for me to lay down my 
jackson sign and pick up a dukakis sign said leskimber a 
jackson delegate from fresno calif you cant turn off these 
things like a water faucet 
kimber and other jackson delegates interviewed on the closing 
night of the democratic convention said they were wary of dukakis 
and reluctant for now to back his candidacy jacksons urging for 
unity notwithstanding 
other jackson supporters pledged their wholehearted support 
we came here together and were leaving even closer together 
said joel ferguson jackson delegation leader from michigan 
but in fact his own ranks were split 
we have a lot of angry people from michigan said jackson 
delegate arthur wiggins of detroit he was not fairly treated at 
all some people think its because he is a minister some think 
its the color of his skin 
dukakis and jackson declared their unity after a preconvention 
summit monday and many of jacksons supporters in leadership roles 
took the cue and endorsed dukakis 
a considerable share of about 20 jackson delegates interviewed 
thursday accepted the dukakisjackson pact 
but at least as many said no not yet 
right now it looks good on television but you have to see how 
many jackson people are brought into the process said chicago 
delegate mark allen you cant go to a bunch of blacks and say 
rise up with nothing but white folks at the front 
theres hope weve talked about partnership said allen 
but theres still a lot of ill feelings in the wind 
in swing states such as allens resolution of those conflicts 
may be critical for the dukakis campaign enthusiastic support from 
blacks could provide crucial votes while lukewarm backing could 
prove crippling 
its one thing to say yes ill vote said allen but is 
there enough here to make the masses of people say ill get 
everybody on my block to vote that remains to be seen 
there was doubt in the south as well jacksons state 
coordinator from virginia mary cox predicted that his voters in 
her state would be cool to dukakis and she had harsh words for the 
dukakis delegates from virginia 
they talk about compromise but what they want is for us to 
compromise she said they want everything 
from georgia jackson campaign chairman gene walker sounded a 
more hopeful but still cautious note the partnership so far has 
been real he said and make sure you put so far 
in the texas delegation about 15 black delegates remained 
seated during a standing ovation for bentsen one said they were 
unimpressed with his civil rights record 
the delegates who were skittish about the democratic ticket said 
it would take time to measure dukakis commitment to their 
constituencies many said they wanted to see whether he helps 
blacks gain party posts at the state and local levels 
there are grounds for suspicion said kimber vice mayor of 
fresno dukakis talks about commitment to affirmative action 
but passed up jackson for vice president he said so of course 
theres suspicion there is suspicion as to his beliefs versus his 
rhetoric 
but jackson delegates did express general satisfaction with the 
party platform and their fears about dukakis pale when compared to 
the ill feeling toward vice president george bush who is to be the 
republican nominee 
the question on dukakis thus might be not whether they support 
him the delegates said but how energetically 
jackson cares about people dukakis im not sure said 
wiggins but if i dont vote its a vote for bush i understand 
that very well

the leader of the striking writers guild 
of america says television and film producers have informed the 
union that contract talks will be broken off but a spokesman for 
the producers denies the allegation 
the strike in its 20th week already has led to sweeping 
layoffs in the entertainment industry and has shredded the fall 
television schedule 
brian walton executive director of the wga west told a group 
of reporters thursday that the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers will not seek a contract agreement at a 
bargaining session set for saturday 
visibly upset walton declared he was nonplussed by the 
alliances decision which he said was relayed to him thursday 
afternoon in a telephone call from alliance negotiator j nicholas 
counter iii 
counter contradicted waltons account of the conversation but 
waltons version was corroborated by a second wga executive mona 
mangan who said she was a party to the call 
according to walton counter called the union to explain the 
position the alliance will take in a negotiating session scheduled 
for saturday by federal mediator leonard farrell 
the saturday session was called by farrell because full 
bargaining teams have not met since june 16 the proposed contract 
that arose from that session was rejected by the guild on june 22 
the two sides are divided sharply on fees for reruns of onehour 
television programs shown in this country and for all programs 
broadcast overseas 
walton reported that counter said no deal will be made 
there will be nothing there saturday nothing will happen and 
forces outside of the collective bargaining process will have to 
resolve this 
walton said he was so surprised by counters statement that he 
called him back to confirm what he had said 
we felt and do feel that we have been in good faith in 
attempting to reach a deal walton told reporters at guild 
headquarters 
but throughout the last four to five months there have been 
weeks upon weeks where the alliance has simply refused to talk to 
us 
counter said that waltons version was wrong i certainly 
would not prejudge what would happen 
meanwhile cbs on thursday announced four new fall series 
including a dick clark variety show which either dont require 
writers or come from abroad 
clarks show will contain specialty acts that require no 
writers on another showhigh risk people with adventuresome 
jobs or hobbies tell their stories to the camera 
the other shows are exempt from the writers guild because they 
are made abroad they are dolphin bay a onehour drama from 
australia and jakes journey a halfhour comedy from england

bolivia refused to send roberto suarez 
gomez to face drug trafficking charges in the united states where 
officials say he is the biggest cocaine producer in the world 
suarez gomez accused of peddling cocaine by the ton through a 
vast global network was behind bars today after police trudged 
through a jungle to one of his five ranches and arrested him as he 
slept 
president victor paz estenssoro says he is very pleased with 
suarez gomezs arrest and that the fight against drugs is the top 
priority of the government interior minister juan carlos duran 
said told reporters thursday 
duran said bolivia will not extradite suarez gomez to the united 
states because he was sentenced to 15 years in bolivia this year 
but us officials said they still will seek to have him brought to 
trial in the united states 
the arrest of the debonair 56yearold suarez gomez who also 
has been accused of helping finance the bloody military coup that 
overthrew the civilian government in 1980 was greeted with 
jubilation 
hes the biggest cocaine producer in the world he has 
enormous acreage in coca plants said chief assistant us 
attorney richard gregorie in miami 
suarez gomez was captured wednesday by 10 narcotics officers who 
trooped through tropical jungles all night and raided his el sujo 
ranch at dawn duran said two bodyguards also were arrested and 20 
automatic weapons were seized 
suarez gomez was flown to la paz from trinidad city duran said 
el sujo about 25 miles from trinidad is one of suarez gomezs 
five ranches in the heart of the tropical beni region in northeast 
bolivia 
until now suarez gomez has used his money and influence to buy 
his freedom in bolivia he publicly spoke of paying off political 
figures and policemen 
suarez gomez was tried in absentia in bolivia this year on drug 
trafficking charges and was sentenced to 15 years 
duran said bolivia has no extradition treaty with the united 
states but us drug officials said they would seek to try suarez 
gomez on trafficking charges in the united states regardless 
gregorie said thursday that an extradition request would be 
entered immediately 
us drug enforcement administration spokesman jack hook said in 
miami that suarez gomez was indicted in miami in 1980 for 
conspiracy to peddle 854 pounds of cocaine but that suarez gomez 
commonly deals in tons of cocaine 
hook noted that carlos lehder rivas leader of a group of drug 
kingpins known as the medellin cartel was sentenced in 
jacksonville fla on wednesday to life in prison without parole 
i think the carlos lehder case goes to show countries that if 
they arrest traffickers here in the united states there are 
jails that can hold them there are courts that will try them and 
most definitely will sentence them he said 
suarez gomezs son roberto suarez levy was extradited from 
switzerland to miami in 1981 on drug trafficking charges he was 
found innocent and after his release from a miami jail was welcomed 
as a hero in bolivia 
while independent of the medellin cartel suarez gomez allegedly 
associated with the colombiabased organization on some 
enterprises said hook but his own smuggling ring was 
selfcontained 
his operations consist of growing coca leaf manufacturing 
cocaine and shipping it to the united states said hook 
he could be considered one of the pioneers involved in 
growing manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the united 
states he said 
the dea says suarez gomez operated from one of his ranches 
planes would fly cocaine paste from the chapare region to the south 
for processing at his labs before shipment to colombia the us 
drug agency alleges 
in 1980 the bolivan human rights association says suarez gomez 
helped finance the military coup that overthrew the civilian 
government of lidia gueiler tejada the interim president and 
installed a government that hired italian german and argentine 
mercenaries to undertake a campaign of terror 
under that rightwing government headed by gen luis garcia 
meza drug traffickers operated with impunity and leftwing 
political figures and labor leaders were killed tortured or exiled 
the mercenaries went after opposition figures and provided 
protection to traffickers human rights activists said suarez gomez 
was the main player on behalf of cocaine traffickers 
estenssoro was elected in 1985 and the civilian government has 
been tougher on drug trafficking than previous regimes last month 
the lower house of bolivias congress accused cocaine kingpins of 
trying to take over the government and called for a united front to 
preserve democracy

found shot to death today at his home apparently after 
accidentally firing a gun designed to look like a pen a police 
official said 
ratu jone veisamasama 50 a prominent member of the fijian 
taukei political group was found slain at his farm in coloisuva 
about seven miles outside of suva 
he first was reported to have been shot by an assailant but 
police said at a news conference that he apparently shot himself 
accidentally with a crudely made gun designed to look like a pen 
no one could have shot him and escaped without being seen 
from this and other evidence it appears it was accidental and 
selfinflicted said jimi koroi acting police commissioner 
the taukei nationalist movement promotes the supremacy of ethnic 
fijians over ethnic indians which outnumber fijians among the 
pacific island nations 715000 people 
the taukei vigorously supported two military coups led by brig 
gen sitiveni rabuka last year that toppled an indiandominated 
government suspended the constitution of the former british colony 
and declared the islands a republic

the staterun press today branded organizers of 
strikes in armenia as narrowminded provocateurs trying to seize 
power but some armenians stayed away from work in a territorial 
dispute with a neighboring republic 
a producer for staterun television in yerevan the armenian 
capital said most factories stores and other businesses were open 
but that some workers remained on strike he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but ruzana ambartsumyan an armenian activist in yerevan said 
most factories were closed because of the strike called to protest 
the soviet leaderships refusal to transfer the predominantly 
armenian region of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan to armenia in 
the southern soviet union 
there was no way to reconcile the conflicting reports about the 
strike because authorities have barred foreign reporters from 
traveling to the region since february when armenians began a 
campaign to annex nagornokarabakh 
in the region itself businesses remained closed because of a 
walkout that began two months ago said a worker for the staterun 
radio station and a reporter for the official newspaper soviet 
karabakh in stepanakert the main city of nagornokarabakh 
soviet television thursday night showed trucks and buses 
standing idle construction sites empty and workers milling around 
stepanakert 
in moscow the press stepped up its attacks on organizers of the 
strike in armenia 
formally they are all intelligent people welleducated but 
this is only formally in reality they are narrowminded 
nationalists intellecutals without convictions political 
adventurers hoping to make a career of provocations and 
blackmail a correspondent for the official news agency tass 
wrote in todays trud newspaper 
the article accused members of the group it said was organizing 
the strike the karabakh committee of bringing the republic to 
economic chaos and abusing soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
policies of openness and democratization 
it said the committees prevailing idea is the seizure of 
power in the republic by getting its members or supporters 
elected to communist party and government posts 
pravda the communist party newspaper joined the attack 
quoting an armenian law professor as saying provocations start at 
the nightly outdoor rallies held in yerevan 
extremistminded elements excite people at the meetings and 
the microphone is given first to those who will not accept 
compromises those who need confrontation for any reason and the 
aggravation of an already tense situation professor v nazaryan 
was quoted as saying 
earlier media reports said two members of the karabakh committee 
were arrested for bringing gasoline bombs to a rally 
at a giant rally in yerevan on thursday night several speakers 
called on workers not already striking to do so as a protest 
against mondays ruling by the presidium of the supreme soviet 
said ambartsumyan who attended the demonstration 
the presidium the executive committee of the soviet parliament 
decreed it would be unconstitutional to transfer nagornokarabakh 
to armenia because azerbaijans government has refused to give its 
consent the region has been part of azerbaijan for 65 years 
several speakers including armenian writer sergo khanzodyan 
blasted gorbachev for not siding with the armenians demand 
according to ambartsumyan and activist igor muradyan 
ambartsumyan said said people began shouting free ayrikyan 
after a lawyer said authorities were violating the human rights of 
paruyr ayrikyan an armenian nationalist tass said on wednesday 
that ayrikyan arrested march 25 and charged with defaming the 
soviet state was being deported

alzheimers disease may be caused in 
some cases by an infectious agent according to preliminary 
findings by yale university researchers 
there is no known cause or cure for the disease 
the researchers said it could take three to four more years to 
confirm their initial observations but they released the findings 
to stimulate more research dr laura manuelidis a member of the 
research team said thursday 
we could be wrong but then in the past we have been right 
she said 
the study was reported in the july issue of the proceedings of 
the national academy of sciences 
alzheimers is a progressive irreversible neurological disorder 
that mostly strikes people over 65 and has an estimated 25 million 
american victims its symptoms include memory loss impairment of 
judgment personality change and loss of language skills 
the researchers said their findings suggest that some people may 
become infected with alzheimers through infectious virallike 
agents similar to those that cause creutzfeldtjakob disease a 
less common form of dementia 
the scientists based their hypothesis on a study of blood from 
11 volunteers who had at least two relatives siblings or parents 
with alzheimers 
the reseachers found that the white blood cells from five of the 
volunteers one of whom has since developed clear signs of 
alzheimers produced brain lesions in hamsters similar to those 
they had seen in rodents infected with creutzfeldtjakob disease 
these transmission results raise the intriguing possibility 
that cjdlike agents may be involved in at least some forms of 
alzheimers disease the report said 
previous attempts to transmit alzheimers to animals were 
unsuccessful 
dr andrew monjan deputy associate director for neuroscience 
and neuropsychology at the national institute on aging in bethesda 
md said it was premature to make any sort of statement that 
there is an infectious etiology to alzheimers 
but he said if you are going to find an infectious agent 
youve got to look at an earlier stage of the disease i would hope 
that the paper would stimulate other investigators to pursue 
similar lines

rescuers worked frantically today to locate more 
than 100 people missing from a boat that sank after hitting a rock 
in a southwest china river an official report said today it said 
four people were killed 
sixteen crew members and 132 passengers were rescued after the 
accident thursday china news service said in a report appearing in 
hong kong newspapers 
the survivors included 129 men and 19 women the news service 
said in a report from chengdu the capital of sichuan province 
about 930 miles southwest of beijing six people required 
hospitalization 
sichuan government officials were quoted in the report as saying 
rescue work was difficult because the accident occurred in a remote 
area and the rivers tide was high 
the boat was heading north from yiban city to leshan when it 
struck the rock and sank at about 430 pm thursday in qianwei 
county about 116 miles south of chengdu the report said 
the news service did not say how fast the boat was going and did 
not give the depth or width of the river at the site of the 
accident 
many people got on and off the passenger boat along the route 
making it difficult for officials to determine the exact number of 
passengers on board when the vessel sank 
the boats capacity was 324 and initial estimates placed the 
number of people on board at about 260 china news service said 
the report said it was not clear if the boat was carrying 
passengers from outside china 
the leshan foreign affairs office contacted by telephone from 
beijing said that sichuan governor zhang haoru and vice governor 
ma lin had gone to the scene but that no details were immediately 
available 
a chongqing central shipping administration official also 
reached by telephone from beijing said the boat belonged to the 
leshan branch of the chongqing shipping co 
he said the company had sent people to the scene but because of 
distance and poor communication they did not expect to have any 
details until saturday 
chinas official xinhua news agency said 115 people were missing 
and 131 people were rescued including five crew members and four 
bodies were pulled from the min river a tributary of the yangtze 
soldiers and militiamen were continuing rescue efforts it said in 
a terse report 
chinas last major boat accident occurred in april 1987 when 
two passenger ships collided in a dense fog on the yangtze river in 
sichuan province killing 18 people and injuring 21

thai officials predict their government will 
reject a proposal that it lend sculptures to the art institute of 
chicago so thailand can recover a historic temple relic it claims 
was stolen

without resolving the dispute that has sparked demonstrations in 
chicago and bangkok 
the relic at issue called a lintel or crosspiece over a door

from 8051250 ad 
it is the only important original piece missing from the 10acre 
khmer temple of phnom rung in the northeastern buri ram province 
near the cambodian border 
we will probably put a sign at the temple where the lintel 
should be so tourists including americans will know it was 
taken that we asked to give it back and that they the art 
institute would not the prince added 
following a morning meeting art institute officials proposed a 
revolvingloan program that would bring to chicago for at least 10

linh made the statement in a meeting in moscow on thursday with

sovietsupplied vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in late 1978 
installed a provietnamese government and are battling three major

cardinal john j oconnor new york mayor 
edward i koch and hundreds of other pilgrims gathered in the stark 
boglands of western ireland today to begin a campaign of prayer for 
peace in northern ireland 
i hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim i hope to do nothing 
but pray oconnor who heads the new yorks roman catholic 
archdiocese said at the airport he said he would not get involved 
in political issues 
koch however repeated his belief that the british should 
ultimately get out of northern ireland and said the government 
should release a report on police violence in the province 
koch joined the pilgrims at the airport following a visit to the 
netherlands where he offended some officials by suggesting drug 
enforcement efforts were lax 
he embraced oconnor who kidded him youre all over the 
papers a reference to a photograph of koch pouring a pint of 
ale in a dublin pub 
ive frequently been told the mayor is going to ireland and 
taking me along oconnor joked 
the pilgrims were drawn to this village by the shrine of our 
lady of knock which commemorates the evening in 1879 when 15 
townsfolk said they saw a vision of mary the mother of jesus pope 
john paul ii visited the shrine in 1979 
some skeptics have argued that a pilgrimage composed mostly of 
catholics will succeed only in threatening northern irelands 
protestants but several pilgrims said prayer deserved a chance 
ireland has been suffering for hundreds of years and the 
problems dont seem to have been solved by any other means said 
agnes mcshane of hastingsonhudson ny english poet william 
wordsworth said more things are wrought by prayer than this world 
dreams 
after three days at knock oconnor will visit belfast and 
armagh in northern ireland and conclude the pilgrimage with two 
days in dublin 
at least 2646 people have died since sectarian violence began 
in august 1969 in northern ireland where the predominantly 
catholic irish republican army is fighting to unite the province 
with the irish republic 
when he announced the pilgrimage on st patricks day after 
three catholics were killed a protestant gunman rampaging through a 
belfast cemetery oconnor called for 100000 participants and said 
prayer had been neglected as an instrument of peace in northern 
ireland 
the number was then scaled down to 1500 but only 350 signed up 
still more than 20000 people including many american tourists 
already in ireland are expected to join prayers at the shrine on 
saturday 
dan kelly a telephone company employee from garnerville ny 
said he came to knock to pray for peace 
it might call more attention to the problem in the states 
he said i think thats what ireland needs more attention from 
the people in the states 
jim higgins the knock areas lawmaker in the dail or 
parliament wished the mission would produce a miracle because 
at this juncture it will require almost divine intervention to 
resolve the problems of the north 
higgins a catholic representing the opposition fine gael party 
said the mission should persuade americans of the futility of 
the iras guerrilla war 
the ira is outlawed on both sides of the border in belfast its 
legal political wing sinn fein said the group had asked to meet 
its leader gerry adams

british investigators say they will interview 
witnesses to world war ii atrocities in their search for evidence 
against more than 100 britons suspected of nazi war crimes 
sir thomas hetherington a member of a british inquiry team that 
arrived this week told reporters the team will focus on the 
ukraine and on the baltic republics of lithuania and latvia which 
nazi forces occupied after attacking the soviet union in june 1941 
the investigators will question people who witnessed murder 
manslaughter and genocide under the nazis he said thursday 
british home secretary douglas hurd established the commission 
in february to decide whether enough evidence could be gathered to 
pursue criminal prosecution of british citizens or residents 
accused of war crimes 
if such evidence can be assembled hurd told parliament he will 
ask the body to change british law to allow prosecution for crimes 
committed outside the country 
canada has passed a similar law and australia is considering 
one hetherington said the united states can prosecute suspected 
war criminals only for violating immigration laws 
the soviet prosecutors office has given the team lists of 
suspected war criminals who are believed to be living in britain 
hetherington said other names and evidence have come from two 
holocaust research centers the simon wiesenthal center in los 
angeles and the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem 
the team compiled a list of 250 suspected war criminals but has 
trimmed it to 110 after reviewing evidence hetherington told 
reporters at the british embassy 
the first witnesses will be interviewed sept 26 in lithuania 
said another investigator william chalmers 
chalmers and hetherington said soviet authorities had been 
helpful in providing information about the suspects and arranging 
interviews 
hetherington britains former director of public prosecutions 
said there was no evidence the british government hid the 
identities of the suspects after the war 
asked why it took more than 40 years for britain to investigate 
the suspects he replied its only in the last few years this 
sort of thing has been an issue 
he said the team hoped to present its recommendations to hurd 
next summer

a judge has ordered the government to honor a 
settlement made with a couple whose baby was born severely 
handicapped at a military hospital even though the child has died 
one must expect that the moral fibers of our nation honor 
integrity and commitment will be reflected as a model to our 
citizens us district judge thomas e scott said in the ruling 
lavern reed who was with the coast guard sued the government 
in 1986 alleging that negligence during his sons delivery at 
homestead air force base hospital resulted in the child being born 
quadriplegic deaf blind and braindamaged 
the hospital and government never admitted negligence and were 
not found liable however the government negotiated a settlement 
with the family to provide for benjamins longterm medical care 
and compensation for the family 
the reeds said the government reneged when their 16monthold 
died just after the 2 million settlement was reached 
government officials called and said hes dead now you 
dont need the money said linda reed who lives with her husband 
in ilwaco wash 
the government argued it didnt owe the money because there was 
never a binding agreement and because no court approved the 
settlement before benjamin died 
the settlement had included a 700000 medical trust fund with 
the unused portion to go back to the government when benjamin died 
said the reeds attorney ira leesfield 
under scotts ruling issued monday the family will receive the 
remaining 13 million which was a guaranteed settlement for the 
parents 
the government has wholly failed its people by not upholding 
these deeply rooted ideals in this case the judge said the 
government more than any other party must be held to honor its 
commitments

more than 70 percent of west 
germans questioned in a survey approve of soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and 41 percent approve of president reagan according to 
results released today 
another poll indicated that west german mistrust of the warsaw 
pact has dropped dramatically the respected allensbach 
institute said 
the allensbach poll said that of about 2000 west germans 
queried in late may and early june 71 percent had a favorable 
opinion of gorbachev compared with 41 percent for reagan 
general secretary gorbachev has exceeded a popularity rating 
of 70 percent something that normally only federal presidents have 
accomplished in the federal republic west germany institute 
director elisabeth noelleneumann wrote 
results of the poll regarding mistrust of the warsaw pact also 
were released today 
in a commentary explaining those results noelleneumann said 
the mistrust towards the soviet bloc has dropped dramatically 
since gorbachev has been at the helm 
at the start of the decade 58 percent of west germans expressed 
mistrust of the soviet bloc compared with 25 percent in the latest 
survey according to allensbach the latest poll was conducted in 
january and involved about 2000 people 
the institute said those polled included people over 16 
throughout west germany and in west berlin it did not release a 
margin of error for the results 
the poll results are in line with indicators that many west 
germans believe a positive trend in eastwest relations will 
continue 
chancellor helmut kohl told a news conference thursday that his 
moscow summit in october will make improved eastwest ties 
irreversible 
defense minister rupert scholz favors a direct dialogue 
between west german and soviet military officials on defense 
matters according to an interview published thursday in the 
allgemeine zeitung newspaper of hanover and the tagesspiegel of 
west berlin 
a growing number of west german companies are seeking business 
with the soviets 
kohl on thursday made clear he will use his kremlin trip to 
cement better eastwest ties 
i want to make sure that the favorable tendencies we now see 
in eastwest relations are irreversible kohl told reporters

jimmy swaggarts first revival outside his 
home state since he was defrocked in a sex scandal begins tonight 
causing painful questions of loyalty for some fellow evangelists 
its a very awkward situation and to some degree 
embarrassing said the rev hp vibbert pastor of abundant life 
memorial church who has been a friend of swaggart since the 1960s 
to have a fellow minister come to the city and conduct such a 
crusade and not even be able to support it 
swaggarts crusade which ends sunday is his first outside 
louisiana since the fiery tv evangelist was dismissed april 8 by 
the assemblies of god for refusing to abide by punishment imposed 
by the church for moral wrongdoing 
in february swaggart tearfully confessed to a tv audience that 
he had committed an unspecified sin against god and his family 
debra murphree a prostitute later said swaggart had hired her to 
pose nude and once had sex with her 
the assemblies of god ordered swaggart to refrain from preaching 
for a year but swaggart returned to the pulpit after three months 
saying his multimilliondollar global ministry could not survive 
the suspension 
the rev mike baldock pastor of the independent new covenant 
church and organizer of the crusade here has said he believes 
about 8000 people will attend each of the three meetings this 
weekend 
baldock said he has had no trouble recruiting more than 500 
volunteers 200 ushers and a security force 
juleen turnage a spokeswoman at assemblies of god headquarters 
in springfield mo said individual pastors must decide whether to 
support the crusade 
officials of the northwest assembly of god church here decided 
not to cooperate in any way said lucille sexton an aide to the 
rev blanche fiscus pastors have been instructed to have nothing 
to do with swaggarts activities here she added 
i choose not to go simply for the awkwardness of being 
there vibbert said if i were there i would feel i ought to 
be with him on the platform so i choose not to go 
my human instinct would be to go down and stand behind him and 
support him but as an assembly of god pastor i cannot cooperate 
with the crusade without contradicting the directions of the 
executive presbytery 
vibbert has been neutral on the issue with his congregation 
neither encouraging nor discouraging attendance 
as for swaggart vibbert said were still friends that 
relationship as far as im concerned has not been severed were 
praying for jimmy

mormon church officials must disclose 
whether a member confessed to molesting children years before his 
arrest an appeals court ruled 
the ruling thursday came in a lawsuit filed against the church 
of jesus christ of latterday saints by the mother of a child the 
church member admitted molesting 
the suit claims kenneth ray told three bishops as early as 1968 
that he had been having sexual contact with children the suit said 
the church failed to report ray to state authorities until 1984 
leaving children vulnerable to abuse 
ray was excommunicated by the church in 1984 for conduct 
unbecoming a member and later pleaded no contest to child molesting 
cynthia brown who sued ray rays former wife and the mormon 
church seeking unspecified damages on her daughters behalf sought 
to force the bishops to disclose whether ray told them he had been 
sexually abusing children 
the church objected saying the bishops were protected by the 
clergymanpenitent privilege 
superior court judge cheryl hendrix ordered the bishops to give 
depositions and the arizona court of appeals agreed thursday 
the appellate court in a 30 decision said ray had waived his 
privilege by disclosing to police what he had told the bishops 
a mormon church official in mesa david udall declined comment 
on the ruling saying he had not read it

the first showroombound cars off the 
assembly line at toyotas first whollyowned american plant will be 
one of three colors red white or blue but the automaker says 
its mere coincidence 
commercial production of the 1989 camry started on schedule at 
the plant july 11 two years after ground was broken said d 
michael dodge plant general manager 
the first cars were white the easiest color to apply because 
the paint is nonmetallic white also is popular with customers 
dodge said 
this week the plant began making dark red cars it will add 
dark blue in two weeks he said and follow that with black and 
dark gray 
later toyota will produce more difficult colors that will be 
offered on camrys for the first time this fall there will be nine 
colors in all 
the camrys go on sale in october said debra sanchez a 
spokeswoman for toyota motor sales in california 
the plant is now producing 19 cars a day it will reach 40 cars 
a day by the end of august and turn out 17000 to 20000 by the end 
of the year dodge said eventually production will reach 200000

the communist party newspaper pravda today 
published a letter from a briton who urged nobel peace laureate 
andrei sakharov to condemn what he called lack of freedom and human 
rights in britain and the united states 
tom hewson urged sakharov to appeal to prime minister margaret 
thatcher and president reagan on behalf of victims of real estate 
development and those who cannot afford health care 
following your public plea for certain freedoms i wish to 
suggest that you also make as impassioned appeals to both mrs 
thatcher and president reagan about the appalling lack of freedom 
and human rights in america and the united kingdom hewson wrote 
he referred to a june 3 news conference by sakharov that he saw 
on british television 
sakharov could not be reached for comment on the letter 
telephone calls to his home went unanswered 
hewson 72 was interviewed by the associated press in london 
from his home in maidstone kent and read the original english 
version of the letter 
he said he is a retired businessman with three children who saw 
the news conference in which sakharov told reporters that soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev had not yet guaranteed human rights 
sakharov also called for the release of political prisoners 
i do not belong to any political party im just a 
straightforward individual who feels that the russian people ought 
to know that the ordinary people in this country are being hard 
done by hewson told the ap 
when i saw sakharov complaining in russia i thought it was 
time somebody balanced the thing up and let the russian people know 
about conditions in england 
hewson suggested sakharov take on the causes of families evicted 
from the isle of dogs a partially derelict industrial and dockside 
piece of real estate in london being developed for hightech 
businesses and residences 
hewson also said that that newborn babies are dying in britain 
because of a lack of money for heart operations and that american 
hospitals refuse to treat the seriously ill for lack of health 
insurance he asked sakharov to protest that 
sakharov hewson wrote should also protest evictions of 
unemployed americans and britons from their homes for not paying 
mortgages 
sakharov a physicist and leading soviet human rights activist 
won the nobel peace prize in 1975 he spent seven years in internal 
exile and was freed in december 1986 
hewson said he was surprised pravda published his letter 
for one thing i only put an 18pence stamp on the letter and 
i think a letter to russia costs 31 pence said hewson

more than 100 helmeted police wielding clubs 
and tear gas rifles guarded the sacred temple mount today to 
prevent possible violence as thousands of moslems gathered to 
worship on their holy day 
palestinianamericans said they were being harassed by israeli 
authorities and a top us diplomat urged them to stand up for 
their rights and file complaints with us consular officials 
most of the 3500 worshipers who gathered on the temple mount 
filed peacefully out of mosques at the end of services but about 
50 youths held up a palestinian flag and shouted jews jews get 
out of palestine 
district police chief rahamim comfort said police arrested a 
palestinian woman and her husband after she tried to smuggle eight 
firebombs past police guards and custodians into the mosque area 
the temple mount known in arabic as the haram alsharif is the 
third holiest site in islam it is believed to be the place from 
which the prophet mohammed ascended to heaven on horseback 
it also is the location of the ancient jewish holy temple 
destroyed by the romans 2000 years ago and is regarded by jews as 
their holiest site 
police prepared for potential violence over the weekend when 
jews mark the tisha bav fast day and moslems begin celebrating the 
fourday id al adha festival 
both holidays focus on the temple mount with jews marking the 
destruction of the temple and moslems celebrating the story of 
abrahams aborted sacrifice of his son 
in a meeting called by the washingtonbased americanarab 
antidiscrimination committee about 200 palestinianamericans 
claimed harassment by israeli authorities 
they said they were frequently singled out for demeaning 
searches at israels borders and their money was sometimes 
confiscated 
palestinians are treated like criminals said hammad siyam 
49 of west new york nj waving his american passport 
siyam who was born in the west bank village of mukhmas said 
three months ago airport authorities confiscated 82950 from a 
village resident and the money had still not been returned 
according to a senior us official israeli authorities have 
confiscated about 200000 from arabamericans in the past three 
months as part of an effort to stop the flow of funds intended to 
support the 8monthold uprising in israelioccupied territories 
since the violence began dec 8 231 palestinians and four 
israelis have died 
philip wilcox the us consul general in jerusalem said 
israeli officials agreed to return the money but he did not 
discuss details of the agreement 
palestinianamericans also complained that israel only granted 
them tourist visas while us jews were given immediate residency 
israel grants automatic citizenship to all jews desiring it 
under the 40yearold law of return 
how come an american jew from brooklyn who has never been here 
before has the right to stay in the west bank forever and i have 
to go back after three months said ahmad baker a physician born 
in the west bank and living in norfolk va 
avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
jews were a special case but as far as american tourists are 
concerned everybody gets the same treatment 
palestinians said israeli policy has divided many families 
because arabamericans married to residents of the occupied lands 
are not automatically granted residency 
wilcox said us officials have discussed family reunification 
with israeli officials he did not elaborate 
on thursday israeli troops fired on demonstrators protesting 
the shutdown of palestinian schools in the occupied lands and arab 
east jerusalem hospital officials said three palestinians were 
killed and 16 wounded

michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen chose a 
gathering of jesse jacksons supporters today for their first 
postconvention appearance with dukakis praising jackson and 
talking of his and bentsens own civil rights experiences 
dukakis told the group including many jackson delegates 
disappointed that he is not on the democratic ticket for the 
election were going to need you we want you we cant win 
without you 
the presidential nominee recalled the civil rights struggle and 
spoke of his own experience traveling to washington dc in 1953 
and seeing jim crow segregation 
he pointed to his running mate and said that as a texas 
congressman bentsen had voted in 1948 to kill the poll tax that was 
used to deny voting rights to blacks 
jackson told the group that dukakis deserves to become the 
next president of the united states 
dukakis who was heading to texas later today with bentsen to 
begin the fall campaign told the jackson supporters we have 110 
days and i hope we can enlist every single one of you in this 
cause 
thursday night in his speech accepting the nomination dukakis 
urged voters to raise our sights beyond the reagan years 
the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin 
dukakis said in claiming the democratic partys nomination for the 
presidency 
were going to forge a new era of greatness for america he 
said 
the threeterm massachusetts governor was setting out on his 
first campaign trip as the nominee after claiming the prize in a 
forceful 50minute speech thursday night to the democratic 
national convention 
the trip was both a symbolic homecoming for bentsen and a strong 
reminder that the democratic ticket intends to battle for texas 
the third largest state with 29 electoral votes and the adopted 
home of republican opponent george bush 
getting a fast start on the general election campaign dukakis 
and his vice presidential nominee then were flying on to stockton 
calif and planned later appearances in minot nd st louis and 
erie pa before dukakis returns home sunday night to boston 
the threeday crosscountry swing was both a campaign kickoff 
and a sign that the democrats believe they can compete in regions 
such as the west southwest and midwest in farm areas and in 
industrial regions that have gone republican in recent elections 
were making a nationwide swing said dukakis spokesman 
dayton duncan he intends to run an aggressive national campaign 
that concedes no state no region to george bush and the 
republicans 
they were visiting three of the four largest states each of 
which loom as crucial showdown states california the largest with 
41 electoral votes texas and pennsylvania the fourth largest 
with 25 states 
theyre all important states that we intend to contend for 
duncan said 
the concluded fourday convention had a heavy focus on the south 
and texas with texans wielding the gavel and delivering the 
keynote speech and with bentsen joining the ticket for a 
bostonaustin axis that had democrats reminiscing about john f 
kennedy and lyndon b johnson in 1960 
this is a truly national ticket with a national message that 
can win in november and will not allow the republicans as they 
have in the past to take any state for granted duncan said 
after his speech and a display of unity with former rival 
jackson and other democrats dukakis made the rounds of parties 
celebrating both his triumph and the euphoria democrats felt over 
the party unity they managed to achieve 
in his acceptance speech dukakis declared the democrats the 
party of the american dream and himself a product of that dream 
and said his candidacy represents the hope of extending opportunity 
beyond the privileged few 
because its time to raise our sights to look beyond the 
cramped ideals and limited ambitions of the past eight years to 
recapture the spirit of energy and of confidence and of idealism 
that john kennedy and lyndon johnson inspired a generation ago 
he said 
dukakis touched the broad themes of his campaign declaring 
this election isnt about ideology its about competence 
he paid tribute to jackson whose conciliatory actions permitted 
the democrats to present a united front entering the general 
election race 
dukakis called jackson a man who has lifted so many hearts 
with his campaign a man whose very candidacy says to every 
child aim high to every citizen you count to every voter you 
can make a difference 
dukakis also offered a reminder of bushs criticism of president 
reagans economic program before bush became reagans vice 
president 
its time to rekindle the american spirit of invention and 
daring to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics he 
said

a launch pad testfiring of space 
shuttle discoverys main engines next week will be delayed at least 
two days nasa officials said today 
the decision to delay until at least july 30 was made after 
shuttle managers reviewed documents that showed not all elements 
were ready including a hazardous gas detection system that is not 
thoroughly checked out 
the 20second firing of the three engines is considered critical 
to certify discovery for the first shuttle launch since the 
challenger explosion on jan 28 1986 
it will test modifications made in the engine and provide 
valuable countdown experience for the launch team 
officials said a delay in the testfiring would have only 
minimal impact on the planned early september launch 
however the status of the launch is in doubt while engineers 
puzzle over how to fix a small leak in a steering engine system 
that is separate from the main engines they hope to make the 
repair on the pad and avoid rolling the shuttle back to a hangar a 
move that could delay the flight by as much as two months 
experts have several innovative suggestions for fixing the leak 
of nitrogen tetroxide gas which normally combines with fuel to 
power the steering engines 
the leak is six feet from the nearest entry panel and is blocked 
from normal access by a maze of tubes wiring and tanks 
taking a cue from heart doctors engineers are considering 
running a thin tube with an expandable balloon on the end through a 
20foot line with six sharp bends in it it would be something like 
a medical procedure known as an angioplasty but instead of opening 
a clogged artery it would close off the leaking line 
the materials and processing lab at the marshall space flight 
center in huntsville ala is devising a mockup of the 20foot 
line to test this approach 
another idea being explored is to enter discoverys cargo bay 
and cut holes through both the rear of the bay and the engine 
compartment to reach the leak then plug it by some method 
including encapsulating it with a clamshelllike device filled with 
a sealant 
engineers hope to begin testing all suggested approaches by this 
weekend

jesse jackson issued an emotional appeal today for 
supporters to back the democratic ticket and told michael dukakis 
and lloyd bentsen that he will be keeping up the street heat to 
make sure they dont forget his constituents 
it is in order and it is right to support this ticket because 
of our access to it and our relaionship with it jackson told 
several hundred delegates as dukakis and bentsen looked on 
we have every reason to be hopeful to be excited to know 
that we are close to where we are going a long way from where we 
started jackson said and in our lifetime you and i will be in 
the white house 
he introduced dukakis as a man ive come to know to respect 
a man ive come to love because of his own sensitivity to 
family jackson added i bring to you a man i plan to watch up 
close when he becomes the next president of the united 
states michael dukakis 
the group erupted in applause and shouts of duke duke 
were going to need you we want you we cant win without 
you dukakis responded 
jackson issued a blistering attack on the reagan record and 
called for democratic unity a progressive agenda will be won with 
a combination of street heat and leadership he said 
he promised dukakis there will be enough heat to cook our 
meat and enough heat for george bush to get out of the kitchen 
jackson recalled that when lyndon b johnson was added to the 
ticket in 1960 some civil rights activists were concered but 
johnson rose to the occasion jackson said 
turning to bentsen he said in a real sense your occasion is 
now you ask us to trust you all we can ask of anyone is that 
they not betray that trust 
jackson repeated that he wants neither a job nor a title with 
the dukakis operation i want to serve free to serve at my own 
pace free to serve free to challenge he said 
he said he expects his own relationship with the ticket will 
influence some policies what does it mean to me in practical 
terms jackson asked the contras have lost a vote 
bentsen who has voted for aid to the nicaraguan rebels and 
dukakis politely joined the applause as delegates chanted no 
contra aid 
jackson who had been the last survivor in the democratic field 
against dukakis had endorsed the ticket at thursday nights 
closing session of the partys convention at the end of the long 
road jackson said i feel fantastic 
but it was clear he would have to do some selling to whip up 
enthusiasn for the dukakisbentsen ticket 
jesse jackson embraced the democratic ticket he had wanted to 
head and gave the democrats the unity sendoff they sought for 
victory in the november election 
as he strode from the podium where he joined democratic nominee 
michael dukakis on thursday night jackson said we have a good 
ticket and a good team and if the unity that is expressed here 
tonight is sustained and expands we will win and we will deserve 
to win 
asked his own feeling at the close of the convention he said 
i feel fantastic 
with the dust hardly settled from his own presidential campaign 
jackson today was looking ahead to new political ventures he 
called a meeting today of his 1200 delegates to include them in 
his plans to campaign for the dukakis ticket raise money for his 
own political action committee and register voters 
it appeared thursday night that he would have to do some selling 
to whip up enthusiasm among some delegates for the team of dukakis 
and sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
signs reading no contra aid printed up by members of the 
vermont delegation were held up by several jackson delegates around 
the hall dukakis opposes aid to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
while bentsen has voted for it in the past 
hes against peace said vermont delegate cindy milstein who 
mentioned several promilitary stands by bentsen 
but jackson officials circulated a statement from him to his 
delegates before the vice presidential vote urging support of 
bentsen the brief statement said that while he disagrees with 
dukakis and bentsen on some issues our interest converges in 
building a coalition to beat the republicans this fall 
jacksons appearance in the hall later was clearly appreciated 
at the mention of his name by dukakis a deafening cheer went up 
from both jackson and dukakis delegates at first jackson sat 
unnoticed in a vip box with former president jimmy carter an 
uncustomary role for jackson until dukakis waved to him jackson 
stood gave a thumbs up and the delegates erupted in emotion

national convention dukakis and running mate lloyd bentsen joined 
jackson this morning before departing on a crosscountry campaign

united states sending the audience of several hundred people 
into cheers of duke duke

they came in second in our lifetime jackson said you and i 
will be in the white house 
at the same time jackson warned dukakis and bentsen he would be 
keeping up the street heat to make sure they serve his 
constituents concerns 
it is in order and it is right to support this ticket because 
of our access to it and our relationship with it jackson said 
in accepting the nomination thursday night dukakis promised a 
presidency that would make america greater better stronger 
prouder 
the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin 
dukakis declared were gonna win were gonna win jubilant 
delegates shouted back 
by early today the floor of the convention hall described by 
some as a an elaborate set for a national television show had 
been reduced to piles of debris by a cleanup crew a few torn 
placards remained left behind by the sleepyeyed delegates now 
boarding airport buses at their hotels 
taking their newly forged partnership on the road dukakis and 
bentsen set out today for bentsens home state of texas a key 
battleground in the fall struggle with bush 
over the next three days stops also are planned in california 
where many experts think the election will be settled north 
dakota in the traditionally republican farm belt where the 
democrats hope to make inroads and in the showdown states of 
missouri and pennsylvania 
its time to raise our sights to look beyond the cramped 
ideals and limited ambitions of the past eight years dukakis 
told a jubilant convention crowd 
beyond the rhetoric there were other reasons for the democrats 
to cheer one was an abc poll taken wednesday that gave dukakis a 
53 to 41 percent lead over bush a sizable conventionweek boost 
from a 4645 republican lead in a poll taken sunday 
the jammed omni coliseum forced to close the gates for a third 
night because of overcrowding never seemed smaller as 
flagwaving handclapping delegates stood shouldertoshoulder to 
cheer dukakis and bentsen clasping their hands high in triumph 
accepting the vice presidential nomination bentsen made no 
bones about his differences with dukakis on contra aid school 
prayer a balanced budget amendment the mx and b1 and other 
policies 
of course we have differences of opinion said the 
silverhaired texan who was put on the ticket to help crack the 
republican grip on the south but on the basic issues of justice 
and opportunity we stand united democrats agree that a good job 
at a fair wage is the passport to opportunity in america 
it was a night for old rivalries to be set aside 
amid an explosion of cheers jackson strode on stage to shake 
hands with dukakis the man he failed to defeat and with bentsen 
whose job he wanted as a consolation prize 
dukakis the cool technocrat who rarely shows emotion was 
stirred by the electricity of the evening and the shower of 
adulation ive never had a night quite like this one before 
he said 
delegates gave him rave reviews you got the idea he is real 
he can feel said darrell ringer a kansas farmer who had been 
pledged to jackson he spoke our language said hartford 
conn mayor carrie s perry another jackson delegate 
betty van uum of st louis said that if bush were watching the 
speech he was probably quaking in his little gucci shoes 
were going to win because we are the party that believes in 
the american dream declared dukakis the 54yearold son of 
greek immigrants i know because i am a product of that dream 
and im proud of it 
his eyes glistened with tears and his voice caught in his throat 
as he spoke of his late father panos how i wish he were here 
tonight hed be very proud of his son and his adopted country 
he said the nov 8 election isnt about ideology its about 
competence 
he said a dukakis administration would have a justice department 
that isnt the laughingstock of the nation 
dukakis promised to do better than the incumbents in protecting 
the environment and fighting illegal drugs whats more he said 
in a dukakis white house if you accept the privilege of public 
service you had better understand the responsibilities of public 
service 
if you violate that trust youll be fired if you violate the 
law youll be prosecuted and if you sell arms to the ayatollah 
dont expect a pardon from the president of the united states 
echoing a 2000yearold pledge of his ancient greek 
forefathers dukakis vowed to never bring disgrace to this our 
country by any act of dishonesty or cowardice in all ways we 
will transmit this country greater better stronger prouder and 
more beautiful than it was transmitted to us 
plotting strategy for the fall campaign dukakis aides said he 
will contest every state with bush who will get the republican 
presidential nomination at the gop convention in new orleans aug 
1518 
he intends to run an aggressive national campaign that 
concedes no state no region to george bush and the republicans 
said dukakis spokesman dayton duncan 
to succeed the ticket will have to win back the disenchanted 
democrats who switched to reagan in 1980 and 1984 nearly 40 
percent of the members of the aflcio voted to reelect reagan 
the democratic party is the party of your parents come on 
home where you belong appealed rep dan rostenkowski of illinois 
in a nominating speech for bentsen that was aimed at the television 
audience across america

vice president george bush today praised the 
acceptance speech of rival michael dukakis but said he intends to 
highlight the differences between the democratic nominee and 
dukakis own runningmate lloyd bentsen 
bush told reporters that an effective use for lloyd bentsen 
would be for him to persuade dukakis to change his positions on gun 
control prison furlough programs and a host of other issues 
the differences are enormous between the democratic 
presidential and vicepresidential candidates said bush who has 
gone out of his way in recent days to praise the texas democrat as 
a conservative 
speaking with reporters at an italian festival here the vice 
president refused to be critical of dukakis on anything other than 
issues the vice president said he watched dukakis speech to the 
democratic convention i thought he gave a very good speech 
bush said he did a very good job 
bush was asked about dukakis statement that he wanted a vice 
president who would come to him immediately if he found out about 
something like the us arms sale to iran 
bush said he didnt know what the massachusetts governor was 
talking about ronald reagan and i have worked as a team i can 
go in there and talk to him any time i want he said 
i dont know what that was all about but i dont think it was 
complimentary bush said referring to dukakis comments 
bush said he was not troubled by his apparent dip in public 
opinion polls following the democratic convention claiming as he 
has before that he prefers fighting back as an underdog 
i never thought it would be a cakewalk the vice president 
said 
bush on thursday said he cant wait for the debates in this 
presidential year referring to what he said would be debates 
between dukakis and bentsen 
bush hurled the barbs at the democrats even as he claimed to be 
trying to keep a relatively low profile as the rival party 
commanded the spotlight in atlanta 
i wouldnt call this real campaigning i dont want to overdo 
it bush who is certain to face dukakis in november told an 
airport news conference in greenville sc 
bush who sandwiched two news conferences between private 
fundraising events in greenville and in charlotte nc on 
thursday was appearing today at an italian festival in milwaukee 
and then flying to bayhead nj for a fundraising event for the 
republican national committee 
bush has all but spent the 27 million allowed to him under 
preconvention federal campaign spending law and is using a host 
of fundraising events for the national party to help finance much 
of his travel between now and the republican convention next month 
in new orleans 
he returned to washington on thursday night from the carolinas 
and said he planned to watch dukakis acceptance speech on 
television at his residence at the us naval observatory 
bush said dukakis struck him as a very good man but he 
suggested the massachusetts governor seemed more positive than 
the rest of the proceedings in atlanta 
he said the democratic convention had produced its share of 
the ploy the old rhetorical shout and that he did not intend 
to respond directly to criticism of him from a succession of 
democratic speakers 
i cant wait for the debates dukakis vs bentsen its going 
to be great he quipped at an airport news conference in 
charlotte 
later in greenville bush said he didnt mind running against 
what he said amounted to three democratic candidates dukakis 
bentsen and jesse jackson 
i think theres two different stripes and three different 
people theres very liberal and then theres lloyd bentsen 
my goal is to focus on the top of the ticket bush said 
the vice president conceded that democrats have seized national 
attention with their convention but he added the memory of 
democratic unity would soon be gone with the wind 
bush allowed that democrats staged an impressive show of unity 
at their convention but he added i dont know whats bubbling 
under the surface of unity theres a lot of bubbling discontent on 
their side 
but thats got nothing to do with me he added my 
business is to take on michael dukakis 
meanwhile administration and bush campaign sources said james 
a baker iii will resign as treasury secretary to become bushs 
campaign chairman no later than aug 5 
bush said he would have something publicly to say on bakers 
role several thursdays from now reinforcing that timetable 
sources said new york investment banker nicholas brady a former 
republican senator from new jersey and chairman of the presidents 
task force studying last octobers stock market crash is the 
leading contender to replace baker as treasury secretary the 
sources spoke only on condition they not be identified 
bush spent last saturday through wednesday on a fishing trip 
with baker a longtime friend and political adviser in a remote 
area near cody wyo 
i was in the wilderness no newspapers no television no 
radio bush said it was heaven 
baker flew to california after the fishing trip so he could 
discuss his decision to leave the administration and to head bushs 
campaign with president reagan administration sources said 
baker will become campaign chairman a job that has been left 
open for him baker ran bushs 1980 presidential effort and was 
senior counsel to reagans reelection campaign in 1984 
bush campaign manager lee atwater told reporters that he expects 
to retain his current job title if baker comes on as the no 1 
campaign official

a series of suspicious stock trades just before 
business weeks widelyread wall street column hit the streets has 
prompted an investigation by the magazines publisher that covers 
the entire operation 
business week spokeswoman mary mcgeachy said thursday that 
mcgrawhill inc was investigating the magazines editorial staff 
as well as employees in its four printing plants to determine 
whether marketsensitive information was being leaked in advance of 
publication 
mcgeachy said that some time back the companys legal 
counsel began tracking stocks mentioned in the inside wall 
street column after noticing unusual rises and heavy trading 
volume in those stocks on the day business week was printed but 
before it reached newsstands 
she said no employees had been suspended or fired 
although the cause of the movements has not been determined the 
probe is reminiscent of a case involving a wall street journal 
reporter who gave a stockbroker advance information on columns 
expected to move stock prices 
all business week employees are informed as part of their 
orientation that they are obligated to disclose their stock 
holdings to the editor in chief and will not report on those 
companies mcgeachy said 
mary mccue a spokeswoman for the securities and exchange 
commission in washington declined to comment on whether the agency 
is investigating the matter spokespeople for the new york stock 
exchange had left their offices for the day when called for comment 
the presses begin rolling out business week in the early morning 
each thursday at plants in connecticut wisconsin and california 
which produce the us edition and in pennsylvania which produces 
the international edition 
the magazine which has circulation of 962000 is shipped to 
distributors on thursday and is released to the news media after 
the stock market closes that day 
mcgeachy said the suspicious stock movements occurred on several 
thursdays according to a story from dow jones professional 
investor report on thursday of the 20 stocks mentioned in the last 
seven inside wall street columns eight rose sharply on heavy 
volume for no apparent reason the day the issue was printed 
for example a week ago gradco systems inc jumped 1 a share to 
975 on more than five times its average daily volume the stock 
was mentioned favorably in the column of the business week issue 
available to the public the following day 
gene g marcial author of the column told dow jones weve 
been very much aware of when it happens 
mcgeachy said mcgrawhill checks the magazines security 
measures each week and monitors stock movements following 
publication 
volumes and stock prices typically move on fridays and 
mondays she noted but that is after the magazine is 
disseminated to the public were very aware of the impact 
business week has on the markets 
mcgeachy said it was not unheard of for printing plant employees 
and drivers to be offered cash for advance copies of some 
magazines but she did not include business week in that category 
mcgrawhills investigation was not limited to business weeks 
editorial staff she said it covers the entire operation 
including the companys printing plants she said 
in 1985 reporter r foster winans of the wall street journal 
was convicted of wire fraud by passing tips to a stockbroker about 
items scheduled to appear in the financial newspapers influential 
heard on the street column 
winans conviction was affirmed by the us supreme court in 
1987 the decision however failed to clarify whether such cases 
constitute insider trading 
winans was sentenced to 18 months in prison for leaking 
information to former kidder peabody amp co broker peter brant who 
was sentenced to 120 weekends in jail and fined 10000 after 
pleading guilty in 1984 to conspiracy and securities fraud

the number of juveniles arrested for selling 
drugs in the district of columbia increased by 456 percent in 1987 
compared to a year earlier according to a city study 
the report released thursday by the districts office of 
criminal justice and analysis indicates that 35 percent of those 
under the age of 18 who were arrested tested positive for drugs 
the hallucinogen pcp was the drug most commonly used the report 
stated 
the report attributes the rise in youth drug arrests to the 
increased use of juveniles by drug dealers 
in a repeat of a surprise finding from 1986 the citys 
fashionable georgetown section remains among the areas where 
violent crimes are most likely to occur 
arrests of adults for drug possession decreased 18 percent in 
1987 but arrests of adults for drug dealing incerased by 5 percent

iran said iraq dropped chemical bombs on 
two villages and occupied three towns in western iran today iraq 
claimed it recaptured the last land seized by iran in the 
8yearold war 
un officials prepared to mediate a ceasefire following irans 
acceptance of a un ceasefire resolution passed one year ago 
but irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
urged iranian revolutionary guards to continue fighting tehran 
radio reported 
irans official islamic republic news agency said iraqi forces 
occupied the iranian border towns of khosrawi qasre shirin and 
sare pol zahab in the central sector of the 730mile front the 
battle is still raging in the area irna said in a report 
monitored in nicosia 
the towns are about 110 miles northeast of the iraqi capital of 
baghdad and sare pol zahab is 12 miles from the border 
a military communique read over iraqi television said iraq 
retook whatever was left of our land from the iranians 
iraq identified the area as the saif saad region a disputed 
territory that iraq claims under the terms of a 1975 agreement 
between the two countries 
the iraqi report made no mention of chemical weapons and it 
denied the iranian report that 5000 iraqi soldiers died in the 
border fighting 
iraq has vowed not to occupy iranian territory which it 
abandoned in the first years of the war after its drive into iran 
was blunted by iranian forces 
the communique said the elite residential guards along with the 
second army corps smashed the iranian defenders and took thousands 
of iranians into iraqi hospitality 
it said the iraqis took a large number of prisoners to equalize 
the number of prisoners held by both sides prior to possible peace 
talks after iran on monday accepted the ceasefire resolution 
iraq proposed direct peace talks iran has refused to meet 
facetoface 
the war broke out in september 1980 when iraqi troops went 
through the border crossing at qasre shirin 
both sides frequently accuse the other of resorting to chemical 
weapons banned internationally by the 1925 geneva conventions 
iraq has admitted using them citing un reports with evidence of 
use by both sides while iran denies their use 
irans moslem combatants are reportedly engaged in ongoing 
fighting with the enemy troops and have inflicted heavy losses and 
casualties on the aggressor iraqis said irna

a jury has awarded 70000 to a man who 
had part of his nose bitten off by a christmas eve reveler 
michael nardella a furnace repairman from branford lost a 
portion of his nose in 1982 in an attack by vern tolman of new 
haven during a party at another persons home 
a superior court jury this week ordered tolman to pay nardella 
70000 but rejected an additional claim that the homeowner had a 
legal duty to prevent the attack 
the jury apparently decided the attack was so bizarre the 
homeowner could not have foreseen it said nardellas attorney 
steven jacobs 
however tolman is unemployed and owns no property we have a 
70000 judgment that isnt worth a penny for all intents and 
purposes jacobs said 
tolman pleaded guilty to assault and was placed on five years 
probation nardellas lawyer said 
nardella has spent 11500 on surgery and requires 8000 more 
in medical care jacobs said as partial compensation he said the 
state criminal injuries compensation board paid nardella 8500

investigators seized files about a florida 
condominium a golf tournament and contributions from a new york 
paper company that was searched as part of the pentagon fraud and 
bribery inquiry court papers show 
the same court documents unsealed thursday say one focus of 
the investigation is on the possible extortion of campaign 
contributions from companies by private consultants and others 
this information was contained in an attachment to a search 
warrant executed last month at the kane paper co in baldwin james 
kane the president of kane paper is the founder of the long 
island aerospace political action committee 
among the documents seized at kane paper which included 
searches of trash receptacles were a florida condo file a 
contribution file a political file box and a folder 
labeled golf tournament 198487 
the document also indicated investigators were probing whether 
an employee of the unisys corp a private consultant and others 
bribed federal officials involved in the authorization or 
appropriation of defense contracts 
the unisys employee named was dennis mitchell whose office also 
has been searched and the private consultant was charles gardner 
a former unisys employee 
unisys a military contractor that manufacturers the aegis fire 
control and radar systems earlier this week announced that it had 
suspended six employees from its surveillance and fire control 
unit which gardner formally headed 
the mitchell search warrant said investigators were looking into 
a possible plot by mitchell gardner and others to defraud unisys 
by diverting monies to individuals and business entities to 
illegally influence the defense contracting process and for their 
own personal use 
according to published reports rep roy dyson dmd toured 
the unisys plant in great neck and was handed several campaign 
contribution checks by mitchell those checks and several others 
mailed later totaled 14000 and were from businessmen and others 
interested in seeing increased military spending on long island 
the news reports said 
dyson a member of the house armed services committee was on a 
trip to see unisys this year when his top aide tom pappas 
committed suicide by jumping from a manhattan hotel the day after a 
washington post story said he made unusual work demands on members 
of dysons staff 
another person who has been searched in the case is richard 
seelmeyer a former aide to the late rep joseph addabbo of queens 
the mention of campaign contributions came in one line in the 
attachment that said investigators were looking into a scheme to 
extort campaign contributions from companies doing business with 
the rest of the statement had been deleted 
the document was among four search warrants and related papers 
ordered unsealed by us district judge edward korman of brooklyn 
in response to an application by newsday inc a new york and long 
island newspaper 
the other search warrants were executed at the hazeltine corp 
in greenlawn the office of mitchell in great neck and the home of 
gardner 
the newly disclosed documents detail the numerous financial 
records computer files letters and other property seized by 
federal investigators at the four locations 
the papers were heavily edited to protect individuals and 
companies not previously named in court papers this was a 
condition to the disclosure set by korman 
in washington pentagon spokesman dan howard said he had not 
seen the court papers unsealed in new york and had no immediate 
comment on them 
meanwhile the hartford conn courant on thursday asked us 
district judge john h pratt in washington to unseal affidavits 
supporting a search of offices there of pratt amp whitney the jet 
engine maker pratt already has denied a request by the washington 
times for the same documents 
in minneapolis us magistrate earl cudd today took under 
advisement a request by cowles media co publisher of the star 
tribune for release of the affidavits supporting a june 13 search 
of three offices at a unisys plant in eagan minn prosecutors on 
thursday opposing the release 
cudd said he would rule next week on whether the documents 
should be released unedited or kept under seal

a federal appeals court has overturned a judges 
ruling combining 35000 asbestosrelated lawsuits against a company 
a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
said wednesday that consolidating the suits would slow resolution 
of the cases 
us district judge robert l vining jr last month consolidated 
the personal injury lawsuits against raymark industries inc at the 
companys request creating the biggest asbestosrelated injury 
case ever 
more than 100 plaintiffs had objected to having their lawsuits 
consolidated saying none of them had been notified about the move 
according to court records they also argued that the evidence did 
not justify the action 
in overturning the consolidation decision the appeals court 
said the courts order which essentially moves their cases back 
to square one could hardly place petitioners in a more drastic 
predicament 
raymark has been the target of 70000 asbestos lawsuits 
involving 82000 people during the past 10 years the suits claim 
people developed asbestosrelated diseases after exposure to 
insulation and other raymark products 
half the cases have been resolved by trial settlement or 
dismissal 
raymark which expects 65000 more cases to be filed during the 
next decade sought to have the suits combined in a class action 
because the separate claims were depleting the companys insurance 
coverage

national transportation safety board 
investigators searching for clues to the cause of a fiery crash of 
a twinengine charter plane combed through wreckage for the second 
day today said a ntsb spokesman 
we dont know the flight history of the plane yet said ted 
lopatkiewicz but he said the planes owner fairways corp has 
said it purchased the aircraft new in 1969 
the 19seat propellerdriven commuter plane crashed wednesday 
during takeoff at dulles interntional airport west of washington 
the only person on board was the pilot melvin shockley of fairfax 
va who was killed 
fairways has been identified by aviation officials as a charter 
service based at national airport but the washington post has 
reported that it is operated by the central intelligence agency and 
that information about the identity of the pilot was delayed at the 
request of the cia 
cia officials have said they would not confirm of deny any 
contractural or proprietary relationship with fairways 
fairways spokesman joseph hexter would not comment on reports 
that his firm is connected to the cia saying only fairways corp 
is a charter airline which flies passengers for the united states 
government and private companies 
lopatkiewicz said shockley who was not identified until late 
thursday had worked for fairways for three years and was well 
qualified to fly the plane 
he said the pilot last week conducted a roundtrip flight to st 
louis with a lear jet returning to national airport with the jet 
on sunday 
that was his last flight before the accident said 
lopatkiewicz 
the plane had been at dulles for a routine maintenance check and 
was headed back to national when it crashed

a group of scientists said today that the 
department of defense is asking for 300 million to start 
biological weapons research that could be dangerous to the military 
and to civilians worldwide 
the scientists organized as a group called the committee for 
responsible genetics announced that it is circulating a petition 
to encourage all american biological scientists to not participate 
in pentagon research that could result in the development of 
biological weapons 
it is clear that the world has come to the point that the 
production of biological weapons is relatively simple said 
christian anfinsen a nobel prizewinning biologist at johns 
hopkins university in baltimore we could develop warheads to 
spread anthrax disease within 6 months and so could the soviets 
but said anfinsen no war could be won this way because a 
counterattack would be swift and deadly 
the scientist said that with the advances in biology of recent 
decades scientists in many countries now could use genetic 
techniques to develop viruses or bacteria against which there could 
be no defense 
anfinsen and three other scientists said at a news conference 
that the department of defense is asking for a 300 million 
appropriation to accelerate its research into a defense against 
biological weapons they said the pentagon plans to reopen the 
dugway proving ground in utah as a biological weapons testilng 
center 
a department of defense spokesman lt col rick oborn said he 
had no immediate comment on the statements 
jonathan king a professor of biology at the massachusetts 
institute of technology said that the same techniques needed to 
develop a defense against biological weapons can also be used to 
develop the weapons themselves 
in an offense biological warfare program the first thing you 
do is develop a vaccine he said 
king also said that the danger of biological weapons is that 
they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vast populations 
if they are released 
biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs 
he said biological weapons can spread and reproduce 
king and the other scientists said that department of defense 
officials now are actively recruiting biologists to conduct germ 
warfare research 
i have been approached and most of us have said king 
the committee for responsible genetics is circulating among 
university biologists a petition that contains a pledge to not 
engage knowingly in research that would further development of 
biological warfare agents

inside the omni hall late thursday night the 
buttoneddown governor of massachusetts strode into a spotlight 
walked confidently past the front row of delegates and climbed to a 
height he had not reached before 
when michael dukakis punched the air in the direction of the 
massachusetts delegation his most fevered backers simply let go 
standing stomping and cheering they fused into a screaming wave 
of released energy 
before he finished the first line of his speech they were again 
on their feet lets go mike lets go mike 
the race to the finish line begins 
another wave of cheering seated side by side mary anastopoulos 
of lowell a daughter of greek immigrants and amy anthony the 
governors toughtalking housing secretary had to prop each other 
up their shoulders shaking and their eyes red 
i accept 
a roaring pulsing outburst of flagwaving signpumping energy 
reflected in dukakis own growing sureness and force 
at the rim of the omni in a skybox above and just behind the 
massachusetts seats campaign manager susan estrich stood front and 
center surrounded by her senior staff surveying their handiwork 
at her side was husband marty kaplan an executive with the 
magic kingdom of disney sitting and standing together they 
personified the marriage of politics and show business unfolding 
with stopwatch timing all around them 
far away across the hall a man they know as michael and joke 
about as a loner and pedant was hitting his lines opening his 
self and on the biggest night of his political life doing his 
job 
time to exchange voodoo economics for cando economics 
 
amplified and fortified by all the wizardry of bigtime 
productions dukakis became the focus of the hunger in the hall for 
belief for challenge and above all for victory 
those handsome and proud and articulate jackson children 
 
with his gestures and his language dukakis encompassed nearly 
all of the doubters leaving bill strickland of amherst mass a 
downtheline jackson coordinator to shrug and join in 
as representatives of the governors home state the 
massachusetts delegation was jammed with delegates and staff 
filling every seat and jamming the aisles standing anywhere they 
could perch to shout pump their signs up and down and punch 
little american flags in the air 
seasoned politicians some of the states highest elected 
officials men who usually sneer at cornball enthusiasm were 
clapping in unison bouncing on their toes in time to march music 
and cheering for a man they thought they knew 
we will never bring disgrace to this our country 
by midspeech the only peole moving besides tv correspondents 
were the dukakis whips working the aisles as best they could 
making sure every delegate had a sign and a flag at the right 
moment leading the cheers pushing and whipping the faithful along 
for politically alert people from massachusetts there was 
nothing new in the speech no stories or facts or attitudes they 
had not heard before in some cases many times 
but by the end the massachusetts corner of the building and all 
the gear and people in it were fused into a giant pulsing 
stomping cheering body 
dukakis worked all his levers and pushed all his themes 
family success seriousness purpose and above all a will to 
win 
on their way out the hoarse and sweaty delegates paused to get 
their bearings surprised at themselves and at him 
some were openly fired up others had that quiet look often seen 
in the eyes of the dukakis team that says they would walk through 
walls for the guy

recipients of assistance from the international

homelands are being victimized a second time as the drought in 
this country dries up the supply of basic food commodities the 
agency said 
prices for such foodstuffs as wheat corn and cooking oil are 
escalating forcing care to reduce the amount available for 
distribution to africa asia and latin america said care spokesman 
george wirt 
already the kinds of foods and the amounts of foods that will 
be available are being affected said rudy von bernuth the 
agencys director of programs we have already lost powdered milk 
for next year 
cares food programs are funded by government grants and private 
contributions while income remains constant the prices are going 
up so fast that the tonnage level needed to support the programs 
will not be met 
in literal terms it will mean less on their plates von 
bernuth said resources are going to be stretched very thin 
for example wirt said the price of vegetable oil has gone from 
712 a gallon earlier this year to 855 its expected that 
bulgur wheat which recently sold for 183 a ton will top 200 a

four young andean condors are going to be 
introduced to the los padres national forest in an experiment that 
wildlife experts hope will lead the way to eventually returning 
california condors to the wild 
scientists said thursday they believe the information they get 
from monitoring the andean condors will help them avoid problems 
when they begin releasing california condors in the early 1990s 
there are only 28 known california condors the largest flying 
birds in north america and all of them are at the los angeles zoo 
and the san diego wild animal park scientists hope to save the 
species by breeding the birds in captivity to build up the 
population and later releasing them 
the last free california condor was captured in april 1987 
although the andean condors which are native to south america 
are considered endangered there are thousands of them 
researchers in the twoyear 200000 program will start with 
newborn condors that havent developed any domesticated habits 
nine zoos have sent eggs to the los angeles zoo and the wild 
animal park after hatching the chicks will be kept in captivity 
for three months using puppets that resemble adult condors to feed 
them said michael wallace curator of birds at the los angeles zoo 
and the projects field coordinator 
we have to make sure the birds have some fear of humans to 
protect them wallace said when they see a human on the 
horizon it may be a hunter 
at the age of three months the birds will be taken to a large 
outdoor cage and they will be released when they are about 7 
months old the age they would normally leave the nest wallace 
said 
the first chicks will be three months old next month and are 
tentatively scheduled to be moved the weekend of aug 19 to a spot 
near the hopper mountain wildlife refuge in northern ventura 
county northwest of los angeles 
a group of eight scientists and technicians and 200 volunteers 
will monitor the birds moves by radio transmitters to distinguish 
eating patterns and other habits scientists said they will provide 
food for the birds throughout the experiment 
the observers will periodically recapture the birds to monitor 
their health and check their transmitters wallace said 
the us fish and wildlife service the lead agency in the 
program will provide protection for the birds wildlife inspector

palestinians are feeling a 
financial pinch after more than seven months of selfimposed 
commercial strikes and a boycott of jobs in israel 
but many say they are managing to make ends meet by cooperating 
with each other raising their own food and passing up large 
purchases propalestinian organizations abroad also have helped by 
stepping up contributions to the occupied territories 
although some palestinians participate in commercial strikes 
under pressure and threats from local arab leaders others say the 
sense of pride they gain from their rebellion makes the financial 
difficulties manageable 
ever since iyad mughrabi 30 quit his 600amonth job at an 
israeli supermarket earlier this year he and his children have 
lived with his parents 
i have gained respect even if i lost money said the father 
of two before when i went to a refugee camp and talked about 
the intefadeh arabic for uprising the young men would say shut 
up and first stop working for the jews 
at a summit in algiers in june arab leaders pledged 120 
million in financial backing for the uprising for the last four 
months of this year and 40 to 50 million after that 
the funds are distributed by an elaborate underground network 
that aids some of the needy and pressures wealthier palestinians to 
serve the national cause by forgoing profits and rent collection 
many contributions enter the territories clandestinely israel 
desperate to cut off the cash flow passed new regulations recently 
making it illegal for arabs entering the country to bring in more 
than 1200 each 
despite the financial help many palestinians are still 
suffering 
western economic observers say the uprising has cost 
palestinians 330 million about 20 percent of the 165 billion 
gross national product of the territories 
since the uprising began dec 8 palestinian stores have opened 
only three hours a day and at least once a week the underground 
leadership calls for a complete general strike 
in addition an estimated 20 to 25 percent of the 120000 
palestinians who once had israeli jobs have quit according to 
israels labor ministry half of all gaza workers and onethird of 
the west banks work force are employed in israel 
in ramallah a palestinian town 15 miles north of jerusalem 
most stores that sell electronic goods and furniture do not open at 
all anymore and a drop in tourism has driven souvenir stores and 
hotels into near bankruptcy 
people want only the very essential stuff sugar rice flour 
canned goods dried yogurt said mustafa abu zahra who said he 
is selling about 60 percent less in his jerusalem dried goods since 
the uprising began he refused to disclose his monthly income 
palestinian farmers too are hurting military restrictions 
such as extensive curfews which bar residents of an area from 
leaving their homes have prevented villagers from irrigating and 
harvesting crops 
in the west bank village of beit ummar the military government 
blocked farmers from exporting grapes and plums to jordan after an 
attacker threw a firebomb seriously burning a soldier said 
olivier rafowitz a military government spokesman 
the grassroots palestinian selfhelp system run by local 
committees under the guidance of underground arab leaders has 
provided some help 
local leaders have exerted pressure on arab employers not to lay 
off workers and workers whose pay has not been affected by the 
uprising are asked to make sacrifices said an arab labor organizer 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
local committees also provide some food and other basics to 
those families whose breadwinners have been killed injured or 
imprisoned in the rioting said a committee activist who also spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
more than 230 palestinians have died in protests since the 
uprising began four israelis have been killed 
many palestinians respond philosophically to questions about 
their fiscal woes 
there are people here who lost children in the intefadeh 
mughrabi said ive just lost money

surgeon general c everett koop said today 
that a wave of public retribution against groups whose problems 
are seen as their own doing including smokers and drunken 
drinkers could spread to aids victims by the next decade 
such a response would be tragic but not unexpected to the 
health profession koop said 
he cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and 
public retribution against drunk drivers teenagers who become 
pregnant drug addicts and wife beaters 
the antismoking attitude he said is being expressed in the 
adoption of laws setting up nosmoking areas in restaurants and 
banning smoking from entire office buildings and workplaces 
these are examples of public retribution exercised against 
smokers he said also telling his audience most americans 
would like to see all smokers stop 
and he said it is possible that the american people already 
traveling the road of retribution will extend that retribution 
against aid victims in the 1990s when the annual health bill for 
the disease reaches 5 billion 
he did not say what retribution might be taken against people 
suffering from the fatal disease 
the challenge to health professionals he said will be to move 
reaction to more responsive productive and tolerant attitudes 
toward those with aids 
the surgeon general commented in a speech after reeceiving an 
honorary fellowship from the american college of legal medicine 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv discovered in 
france and the united states 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases are attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of july 4 aids had been diagnosed in 66464 americans of 
whom more than half or 37535 have died since june 1981 according 
to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids

the drought in the united states 
is turning into a multibilliondollar boon for farmers in 
economically distressed argentina and brazil agricultural experts 
say 
while us crops wilt under the worst drought conditions since 
the dust bowl recently harvested crops of soybeans and winter 
wheat in argentina and brazil are fetching the highest export 
prices in years the experts say 
many of argentinas 450000 farmers are planting as much as 
possible to cash in on record prices for soybeans which last year 
replaced wheat as the countrys no 1 cash crop argentina is the 
thirdlargest producer of soybeans after the united states and 
brazil 
soybean plantings increased 19 percent in argentina and 156 
percent in brazil this year compared to 1987 the experts say 
olacyr de moraes brazils soybean king and one of the countrys 
richest men just bought 74100 acres in northern maranhao state to 
plant the crop 
after suffering from years of low world grain prices argentine 
farmers of wheat corn sorghum and soybeans see a bright 
shortterm future they are buying land and ordering new tractors 
and farm equipment 
were all conscious that our wellbeing is owed to the drought 
in the united states said rogelio luraschi manager of the 
carlos casado farm cooperative outside rosario 200 miles northwest 
of the capital 
earlier this month agriculture secretary ernesto figueras 
estimated revenues this year from grain exports primarily 
soybeans wheat and corn at 38 billion dollars up 2 billion 
dollars from 1987 
in brazil the government estimated revenues from soybean 
exports its top cash crop at 35 billion this year up 12 
billion from 198 it expects a bumper soybean crop of 182 million 
tons up from 17 million tons in 1987 
the multibilliondollar boost couldnt have come at a better 
time 
argentina is plagued by an average annual inflation rate of 322 
percent unproductive state industries and worker unrest over wages 
that fail to match the rising cost of living 
brazil too is suffering from an economic crisis it is the 
developing worlds largest debtor owing creditors 121 billion 
mexico is second followed by argentina which owes 55 billion 
although the argentine and brazilian soybean crops are close to 
being fully harvested farmers in both countries say they are 
holding on to much of their stock to see what the market will do 
for instance the price of a 132pound bag of brazilian soybeans 
has tripled since april compared to an inflation rise of 68 
percent in the same period inflation in brazil is averaging 600 
percent this year 
the new international prices will signify a big boost in 
revenues for the country said guillermo alchouron president of 
the argentine rural society an association of the nations most 
important farmers and ranchers 
but the argentine association of grain producers fears the 
government may cut newfound profits by reimposing export duties 
abolished last year 
when argentine president raul alfonsin denied such plans last 
month alchouron said farmers were waiting for this message 
its necessary to prevent the deterioration of a sector like 
farming which can bring the country out of the economic crisis 
one result of higher international grain prices is the rising 
cost of farmland in productive areas like that outside rosario 
which has doubled since january argentine farmers say brazilian 
soybean farmers report similar trends even in the normally dry 
northeast 
feed prices also have risen for poultry and livestock producers 
forcing some argentine producers to slaughter their livestock or 
reduce poultry stocks 
even the price of cookies in argentina the fourthlargest 
consumer of cookies per capita in the world has risen because of 
the rise in the price of wheat producers note 
curiously argentinas government has been low key about its 
farmers good fortune 
the daily business newspaper ambito financiero of buenos aires 
noted the government doesnt want to show too much euphoria with 
all of this because it is negotiating for fresh funds with the 
foreign lending institutions 
hector huergo wrote in somos magazine last month that argentine 
farmers would be wise to take their profits now 
as keynes said in the longterm well all be dead huergo 
said in the meantime the question is how to take advantage of 
the drought

american diplomacy is in the midst of an 
energetic and apparently successful peacemaking drive even as 
president reagans term in office slips into the shadows 
after years of strife peace may be coming to southwestern 
africa and to the persian gulf and cambodia as well 
wars are still being waged all over the world of course and 
central america and the middle east pose intractable problems 
but symbolic of the turnabout the ayatollah khomeini who vowed 
in 1982 we will not make peace said this week he was taking 
the advice of highranking political and military experts and 
accepting a ceasefire with iraq even though it would have been 
more bearable to accept death and martyrdom 
in southeast asia a promised withdrawal of vietnamese troops 
from cambodia is bound to lower tensions and there is a more 
promising reversal too 
the soviet union after saying for years what vietnam did in 
cambodia was vietnams business suddenly has agreed to discuss a 
settlement with china 
a successful meeting next month could clear the way for a 
sinosoviet summit propelling the worlds two communist giants 
into a spiritual embrace 
there is no sign yet of peace in central america once again 
the state department stiffarmed a request this week by nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega for a highlevel meeting instead 
department officials invited ortega to talk to the contra rebels 
who are trying to oust him from office 
secretary of state george p shultz will huddle aug 1 with the 
leaders of costa rica el salvador guatemala and honduras in 
guatemala city on ways to build up pressure on ortega 
the middle east isnt very peaceful either violence on the west 
bank is rising and while shultz is making plans for his fifth 
peacemaking veture to the region so far this year the odds are 
long that he can persuade king hussein of jordan and prime minister 
yitzhak shamir of israel to enter negotiations under conditions set 
in washington 
but in contrast to the usual gloomy news this has been a week of 
dramatic peacemaking 
look at africa 
the agreement announced by south africa angola and cuba would 
produce two longelusive results the withdrawal of up to 50000 
cuban troops from angola and the creation of an independent namibia 
after 73 years of south african rule 
the plan brokered by assistant secretary of state chester 
crocker also could lead to an early withdrawal of south african 
troops from southern angola 
crocker the hardworking former academic took heat from both 
left and right through the years he was accused on the one hand of 
not applying enough pressure on pretoria and on the other of 
favoring antiwestern black forces at the expense of the white 
regime 
crocker has labored through months of negotiations in london 
cairo and on governors island in new york harbor he knows how 
peace dreams can fall apart so he cautioned on wednesday that 
there was hard bargaining ahead on such issues as drafting the 
text of treaties and a cuban withdrawal timetable 
moreover even if the agreement holds the 13year angolan civil 
war is not coming to an end the united states will maintain its 
support for guerrillas led by jonas savimbi who are at war with the 
marxist government in luanda savimbis unita rebels have received 
15 million in us military aid since 1986 
but the big picture is rosier we have traveled a long 
distance to get to this stage south african foreign minister 
roelof f botha said of the threenation agreement 
the next round of negotiations is set for geneva on aug 2 
while botha cautioned that the road ahead was steep and full of 
potholes and dangerous curves an unprecedented expectation of 
success has enveloped the state department 
officials who work at and worry over the persian gulf are 
keeping their fingers crossed they know the war between iran and 
iraq could not be settled on the battlefield or through a united 
nations arms embargo the fighting has seesawed for eight years 
the soviets will not allow an embargo to clear the security council 
so all the us chips are on secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellars effort to nail down the ceasefire iran suddenly agreed 
to after a year of vacillation 
it opens the way to an end to the eightyear tragic war and 
restoration of stability in a troubled area of the world said 
marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary 
to which us officialdom murmured a prayerful amen

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said today he has invited iran and iraq to send their foreign 
ministers to new york next week to discuss implementing a 
unsponsored ceasefire and peace plan 
there was no immediate reaction from iran or iraq but envoys of 
both nations have said their foreign ministers or other high 
officials would accept an invitation from the secretarygeneral 
i very much hope to see them early next week in new york 
perez de cuellar told reporters 
iran meanwhile accused iraq of trying to sabotage un efforts 
to end the 8yearold persian gulf war by pushing for facetoface 
peace talks 
iraq has urged direct negotiations with iran in new york before 
a ceasefire goes into effect iran has rejected the proposal 
saying it only will negotiate through the secretarygeneral 
the un chief declined to comment directly on the format for 
negotiations but middle east sources said iraq would be interested 
in proximity talks through the secretarygeneral as intermediary 
between the belligerents 
perez de cuellar did not say whether iraq formally has agreed to 
receive a un technical team to work out details of a ceasefire 
iran already has agreed to receive the eightman team which is 
to arrive in tehran sunday from jerusalem and vienna iraq has not 
made a similar committment 
i expect the team to arrive in the area in the next few 
days perez de cuellar said 
there was no official word on whether iraq would accept the 
team iraqi officials said the un request to receive the team is 
under study 
the baghdad government has called for direct talks before a 
ceasefire and has said that the visit of the team to iraq and its 
request for talks in new york were being discussed together 
perez de cuellar said that after the teams weeklong visit he 
would be able to set all the dates to put security council 
resolution 598 in motion 
the resolution passed a year ago calls for an immediate 
ceasefire prisoner exchange troop withdrawal comprehensive 
peace talks and an impartial body to determine which side started 
the conflict 
iran announced monday that it unconditionally accepts resolution 
598 and wants an immediate ceasefire iraq which has said for the 
past year that it accepts the resolution now says iran should 
prove its sincerity in direct talks before a ceasefire 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati denounced iraqs 
new proposals as efforts to sabotage the peace process he said 
iraq was trying to introduce extraneous elements which will only 
complicate the whole thing 
iraq wants to gain some more territory and leverage he said 
iranian counselor mohammad javad zarif said iraq is going 
against its own statements endorsing resolution 598 which calls for 
an immediate ceasefire 
he said iran has unconditionally accepted the resolution and 
its implemention in explicit statements by his nations highest 
leaders 
this is not a tactical continuation of the war and there is no 
excuse for iraq to delay implementation of resolution 598 he 
said 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz sent a fivepoint proposal to 
perez de cuellar on wednesday calling for direct talks in new 
york baghdad and tehran 
the request of the secretarygeneral to dispatch a mission is 
under discussion in baghdad iraqi ambassador ismat t kittani 
told a news conference thursday 
but he refused to say whether iraq would allow the team to visit 
after direct talks were arranged 
we are at a critical juncture and there should not be a 
stampede to ceasefire thats only a small part of a 
comprehensive and durable peace he said pressuring iraq would 
be counterproductive 
he said that he was surprised that iranian officials refuse to 
talk directly with iraq 
with whom are they going to negotiate and sign a comprehensive 
peace agreement he asked the secretarygeneral

nearly twothirds of college students 
presented with mock rape scenarios said they believed the victim 
was at least in part to blame for the crime a study has found 
eugenia gerdes a bucknell university psychology professor 
tested the opinions of 64 college students told to act as jurors in 
scenarios in which a collegeage rapist attacks a fellow student 
walking alone at night 
they clearly think he did something wrong they also think the 
choice of a victim wasnt random ms gerdes said in an interview 
thursday 
fortyone of the students said the woman may have done something 
to promote the rape she said 
some students said the victim may have smiled at or flirted with 
the rapist while others said she shouldnt have been walking alone 
at night or may have been wearing provocative clothing ms gerdes 
said 
she also found that women taking part in the study last year 
tended to be more sympathetic with the victim and gave the rapist 
tougher prison sentences 
the 32 women in the study gave the rapist a 22year prison 
sentence on average while the men averaged a 15year sentence 
ms gerdes said they were told not to consider the possibility of 
parole she said 
all the students in the study were given typed stories they were 
told were realistic accounts from a college newspaper accompanying 
the articles were pictures of the purported rapist and victim 
ms gerdes gave each student one of two accounts of a rape in 
one the victim and rapist took a class together and she recognized 
him in the other the victim and rapist lived on different sides 
of campus and never took a class together 
in both cases the rapist is caught in the act 
once people even think the rapist and the victim have been 
together anyplace before people begin to think what made him do 
it what might she have done ms gerdes said 
twentythree of the 32 students given the scenario in which the 
rapist and victim knew each other said she may have done something 
to promote the crime according to the study 
even when presented with no evidence the rapist and victim knew 
each other students in the study suggested they may have seen each 
other on campus according to ms gerdes 
just the fact that they are willing to suggest things the 
woman might have done to provoke the rape even when the defendant 
is clearly guilty shows that people still fail to understand rape 
as a violent crime they try to make sense of a random act by 
viewing it as a sexual encounter she said 
eighteen of the 32 students given the scenario in which the 
rapist and victim are strangers said they thought the woman may 
have done something to promote the rape ms gerdes found 
ms gerdes said she changed the pictures accompanying the 
scenarios to give different combinations of attractive and 
unattractive victims and rapists 
students believed an unattractive victim who knew her assailant 
beforehand would be more likely than an attractive victim to have 
enticed the defendant ms gerdes said 
an unattractive victim was blamed less if attacked by a 
stranger she added 
students especially women rationalized that the victim was 
less to blame if the rapist was unattractive saying a woman was 
unlikely to make sexual advances toward an unattractive man an 
unattractive rapist was the only scenario in which students 
perceived the rapist as dangerous and antisocial

iraqis have the arab zest for celebrating 
but there is little sign of jubilation over irans agreement to a 
truce in an 8yearold war that has cost iraq hundreds of thousands 
of dead and wounded 
there was nothing no reaction said a european diplomat who 
was in baghdad on monday when iran announced acceptance of a 
ceasefire iraq had sought for at least six years 
iraqis seem deeply suspicious of the iranian decision and the 
government is insisting any truce be tied to a final settlement 
parades celebrations and television specials typically greet 
iraqi victories in battle none followed the iranian announcement 
i really want the guns to fall silent and for my dear husband 
to come home said suad mousa 34 who has three children and a 
husband who has been in the army since the war began 
when the iranians said they would accept the un ceasefire 
resolution i really thought the war was finally over but it seems 
now it will take weeks and probably months before he will be 
back she said 
official news media and president saddam husseins ruling baath 
party have encouraged caution along with continued vigilance by 
the military 
the army has continued to fight and said thursday night it had 
recaptured 33 northern hills lost to iran in the early days of the 
war 
iran said iraqi units penetrated 12 miles into its territory 
friday it claimed iraq used chemical weapons and that iranian 
soldiers killed 5000 iraqis 
exultation is common here over much less than the end of a long 
and costly war fusillades of tracer bullets lit the night sky over 
baghdad when iraq defeated rival syria in the arab soccer 
championship thursday night 
wedding parties toot car horns and bang drums as they move 
through the streets of baghdad 
families are buying sheep to slaughter for the eid aladha feast 
that marks the end of islams season of pilgrimage to mecca the 
date depends on the moon but it is expected sunday or monday 
celebration of the wars end however apparently will have to 
wait for a final peace 
diplomats in baghdad say distrust of the iranians who accepted 
a security council resolution they had rejected since its passage a 
year ago is rooted in thousands of years of conflict between arab 
iraq and persian iran 
government officials also feel iran may want a truce only as a 
respite in which to rebuild their army which has lost several 
battles this year 
some cite iranian statements that a ceasefire does not mean the 
end of the war which irans revolutionary patriarch ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini sees as a crusade for his own vision of islam 
iraq rejected proposals of a ceasefire two years ago when its 
own forces were being battered near the southern city of basra and 
many observers felt collapse was near 
it would certainly not accept a truce without real peace now 
that it has the upper hand militarily said a western diplomat who 
recently talked with iraqi officials he said iraq insists on 
direct peace talks with iran as a sign of serious purpose 
a european diplomat said iraqis are still going to be nervous 
about the iranians because the iranians havent been beaten and 
still are ruled by crusading clerics he said iran could be 
militarily quite potent within a year or two 
although they are not celebrating ordinary iraqis are anxious 
for the war to end 
i am an old man said 68yearold mahmoud shaker at the 
counter of his auto parts store i have been running the shop for 
four years since my elder son was conscripted i am very tired and 
i want him back to the shop and with the family

could have brought the electric chair at the request of the 
attorney genrals office the grand jury returned charges carrying

name he has said none of the adults aboard the bus had been

a triumphant michael dukakis and running mate 
lloyd bentsen left atlanta on friday promising a 50state campaign 
but several states will be clearly emphasized as the democrats work 
to piece together a winning electoral college puzzle 
dukakis and his aides said all week that they would not 
concede one single state to the republicans in the fall and in 
appearance they wont but concessions aside the intinerary for 
the first postconvention campaign swing is instructive for what it 
says about dukakis fall strategy 
texas california and pennsylvania will be key battlegrounds 
aides said in a series of briefings this week all three states are 
on the schedule for the quick crosscountry trip dukakis and 
bentsen began the day after they accepted their nominations there 
also are stops in missouri and north dakota tougher challenges 
for the democrats but an early warning to republican george bush 
not to take things for granted anywhere 
where we are strong we will be highly visible said one 
senior dukakis adviser where we are not so strong we will try 
to turn things around and if we cant well give the troops enough 
ammunition to maintain a battle 
the war for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the white 
house likely will be waged on two fronts 
bentsen is up for reelection to the senate and will spend the 
bulk of his time running a dual campaign in texas something 
republicans already are criticizing dukakis aides said bentsen 
also will campaign throughout the south and southwest recently 
republican regions vital to a democratic victory in the fall while 
doing the job he was appointed to do heaping praise on dukakis 
bentsen also will woo elderly and bluecollar voters with talk of 
his key role in the passage of catastrophicillness health care and 
plantclosing legislation dukakis and bentsen aides said 
dukakis having signed bills balancing his state budget will 
spend much of the hundredplus days before the election 
crisscrossing the country with his message of competence and 
economic opportunity campaign aides see victories in a halfdozen 
big states california new york illinois ohio michigan and 
pennsylvania as vital those states hold 175 electoral votes 
texas with its 29 electoral votes is a crucial test that will 
show the wisdom or lack of it in selecting bentsen and dukakis 
aides say they also think florida is winnable 
this is a truly national ticket with a national message that 
can win in november and will not allow the republicans as they 
have in the past to take any state for granted dukakis 
spokesman dayton duncan said 
a leading republican critic of the democratic ticket sees it 
otherwise 
sen bob dole of kansas like other republicans tying jesse 
jackson to the ticket said friday that the liberal candidates 
will target the northeast while the other candidate takes to the 
south 
dukakis left atlanta with a doubledigit lead over bush in 
national polls but just moments after his optimistic and unusually 
emotional acceptance speech he cautioned delegates about 
overconfidence 
were going to need you all he told a postconvention 
party this is going to be a tough tight competitive race 
that all includes jackson supporters by next week the 
dukakis campaign expects to announce that numerous jackson campaign 
aides have joined ranks with the nominee 
the additions will take over as state directors of the dukakis 
effort in several states as well as codirectors and deputy 
directors said charlie baker the dukakis campaigns director of 
field operations a dozen state directors posts are as yet 
unfilled including those in several states jackson won 
baker refused to name the jackson aides being recruited but said 
he would have a list for dukakis to review as he headed south then 
west then to the midwest and finally back east with bentsen 
dukakis who insists on interviewing all prospects for top 
campaign jobs will conduct some interviews on the trip and others 
shortly after returning to boston baker said

presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari 
says he hopes to strengthen mexicos relations with the united 
states which have soured over drug trafficking illegal 
immigration and political differences about central america 
salinas de gortari also wants to expand economic ties with 
western europe and asia after he begins his sixyear term dec 1 
the presidentelect is from the institutional revolutionary party 
which has governed mexico since 1929 
although never smooth relations between mexico and the united 
states reached their lowest point in decades under the sixyear 
term of president miguel de la madrid 
the latest diplomatic incident occurred in june when mexico 
ignored an american request for the extradition of puerto rican 
separatist william morales by releasing him from jail and allowing 
him to fly to cuba 
the united states called the action an inexplicable affront 
and called ambassador charles j pilliod jr back to washington for 
consultations a gesture of great displeasure in diplomatic 
practice 
earlier in de la madrids term thenambassador john gavin made 
us displeasure just as clear over the investigation of the 1985 
kidnapslaying of drug enforcement administration special agent 
enrique camarena salazar in guadalajara washington said mexican 
authorities were going too slow 
other irritants in relations have been mexicos support of 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government and its refusal to 
consider the central american conflict a result of the eastwest 
crisis mexican illegal immigration to the united states terms for 
mexican foreign debt payments and alleged us trade barriers to 
importing mexican goods 
in speeches and interviews during the campaign salinas has 
stressed the need for fencemending 
due to geography history and the wide scope of contacts 
between both nations relations with the united states will 
continue to be of great importance in our foreign policy he said 
in one speech 
for a start he has been playing down mexicos support of 
central american leftists expressing hope the central americans 
will be able to solve their own problems peacefully 
he also has adopted a tougher attitude towards drug trafficking 
calling it a threat to our national security and promising to 
do more to fight it 
on the debt illegal aliens and other problems salinas has been 
urging serious negotiation the united sates is mexicos principal 
trading partner and mexico is the united states third after 
canada and japan 
beyond our commercial financial and tourist exchanges there 
exists a huge network of contacts a crossborder flow of persons 
ideas goods and services that seem to have an existence in 
themselves and are beyond the reach of our institutions salinas 
said adding 
we derive mutual benefits from these contact but we also 
share the problems that stem from them we shall give impetus as i 
have said to the intensification of our economic and technical 
links on a bilateral basis under the principle of promoting more 
friendly relations 
salinas says mexico will not take part in a north american 
common market which the united states and canada are trying to 
build instead he says mexico will take part in efforts to achieve 
latin american economic integration and intensify economic and 
other ties with canada the pacific basin and western europe 
salinas says the fact a majority of latin americas countries 
now have elected civilian governments compared to a decade ago 
when they were ruled mostly rightist military regimes is a good 
sign for the achievement of economic integration and to the 
building of a real latin american community

a judge today refused a mans request 
to prevent his former girlfriend from having an abortion 
justice joanne veit of court of queens bench said however 
that the man randy mock 25 could sue for damages for such things 
as emotional trauma if 18yearold michelle brandanburg goes 
through with the abortion 
mock had obtained a temporary injunction preventing ms 
brandanburg from having the abortion the 48hour injunction 
expired thursday 
mocks lawyer rosanna saccomani had argued thursday that the 
two were bound by an oral contract when they agreed as a commonlaw 
couple in february to stop using contraceptives so they could have 
a child 
there was an intention to create a child that was what 
the parties wanted she said she should continue with her 
obligations 
the pair who had gone together for 18 months broke up in june 
ms saccomani said that they still care about each other but that 
ms brandanburgs family opposed the relationship she said mock 
was willing to raise the baby himself 
donna oliver dyck who represented ms brandanburg told the 
court that mock had no rights as the father of an unborn child and 
that the application to stop the abortion was ludicrous

garbage collection bill for an elderly couple prompting the city 
to call a truce with the ardent recyclers and restore their water 
service 
the city cut off water july 13 to clarence james 84 and his 
wife dorothy 82 under an ordinance requiring all residents to 
have garbage collection which costs at least 257 a month the 
couple refused to pay the fee saying they dont generate enough 
nonrecyclable trash to warrant such service 
city manager doug zenor said he received 25 thursday to pay for 
reconnecting the couples home to the city water system he would 
not say who paid the bill except that it wasnt the jameses or a 
city employee 
kim nisbet a secretary at north lincoln sanitary co said 
somebody paid a years fees for the couple 
calls to the couples home went unanswered 
council members adopted the mandatory garbage collection law 
last fall because people were using trash bins at parks and on 
highways to get rid of household garbage zenor said he said the 
ordinancy has made the city cleaner 
he said that before the ordinance 1600 to 1700 homes had 
water and sewer service but no garbage service a number of homes 
in this beach city 75 miles southwest of portland are second 
residences for people who live elsewhere

a wave of retribution against smokers 
drunken drinkers and others whose actions are seen as a public 
health threat could spread to aids victims by the next decade 
surgeon general c everett koop said friday 
such a response would be tragic but not unexpected to the 
health profession koop said 
he cited the recent passing of laws to segregate smokers and 
public retribution against drunk drivers teenagers who become 
pregnant drug addicts and wife beaters 
the antismoking attitude he said is being expressed in the 
adoption of laws setting up nosmoking areas in restaurants and 
banning smoking from entire office buildings and work places 
these are examples of public retribution exercised against 
smokers he said also telling his audience most americans 
would like to see all smokers stop 
koop said it is possible that the american people already 
traveling the road of retribution will extend that retribution 
against aids victims in the 1990s when the annual health bill 
for the disease reaches 5 billion 
he did not say what retribution might be taken against people 
suffering from the fatal disease 
the challenge to health professionals he said will be to move 
reaction to more responsive productive and tolerant attitudes 
toward those with aids 
the surgeon general commented in a speech after receiving an 
honorary fellowship from the american college of legal medicine 
asked if there was any good news to report about aids koop 
replied nothing that you can see on the horizon 
but he said that one unexpected but potentially beneficial 
result of aids research is that it is likely to produce 
spinoffs useful in treating other diseases 
i think this will have tremendous benefits on other diseases 
if we can shake the scientists loose enough to use them he said 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
the incurable condition is believed caused by an unusual virus 
now called human immunodeficiency virus or hiv discovered in 
france and the united states 
its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
users although a small percentage of cases is attributed to 
transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and spread 
from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of july 4 aids had been diagnosed in 66464 americans of 
whom more than half or 37535 have died since june 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids

civil defense minister vito lattanzio announced friday 
the minister said he could not immediately say where or how the 
toxic wastes will be disposed of in italy

nigerian officials 
lattanzio said one italian freighter already sailed for nigeria 
while the second will leave within a few days 
last month another load of toxic waste was shipped back to italy 
after authorities in djbouti venezuela and syria refused its 
disposal 
the 2100 metric tons of toxic material belonging to italian 
chemical firms are aboard the freighter zanoobia currently 
anchored in the italian port of genoa 
a metric ton is equivalent to 2205 pounds

the justice department has concluded there is 
no basis on which to conduct a criminal investigation of former 
deputy attorney general arnold burns for promoting his former law 
partner for a judgeship sources said friday 
the criminal divisions public integrity section reached the 
conclusion said the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
after reviewing information about the relationship between burns 
and stuart summit who has been nominated to the 2nd us circuit 
court of appeals in new york 
burns was still receiving payments from the law firm and had 
investments in limited partnerships with summit at the time he was 
urging summits nomination last year 
burns resigned in protest in march over a different issue the 
continued leadership of the department by attorney general edwin 
meese iii who then was under an independent counsels 
investigation for alleged conflicts of interest that probe 
concluded without indictment though independent counsel james 
mckay said meese probably violated the law on four occasions 
meese has since announced his own resignation but insisted that he 
was vindicated 
the washington times disclosed burns support for summit in 
articles last month suggesting the former deputy attorney general 
might have violated federal conflictofinterest law 
when asked about the public integrity sections decision summit 
said he was not surprised there never was anything to it and 
said he was pleased about the outcome 
burns and former criminal division chief william weld plan to 
testify next tuesday about their march 29 protest resignations 
they quit out of concern that the continued tenure of meese was 
hurting justice department operations and morale 
congressional sources and sources close to the justice 
department have said the leaking of unfavorable information about 
burns and weld has been an attempt to discourage them from 
testifying before the senate judiciary committee 
the washington times this month disclosed that weld had been the 
focus of an internal justice department investigation into whether 
he smoked marijuana at a wedding in 1982 weld has emphatically 
denied the allegation made in an anonymous letter and the 
departments office of professional responsibility closed the 
matter

the 470mile colorado trail 15 
years in the making mostly by volunteers and winding through 
aspencovered mountain valleys is to be dedicated this weekend 
but some of its builders couldnt wait theyre already out 
hiking 
spanning twothirds of colorado the colorado trail passes 
through five national forests cross the continental divide five 
times and skirts not only 14000foot rocky mountain peaks but also 
historical sites ghost towns and environmental no mans lands 
scarred during the mining boom days 
most of the trail was built by 3000 volunteers said dennis 
neill a forest service spokesman many spent entire weeks of 
vacation clearing brush and building trail 
the forest service did the dangerous stuff like blasting 
rocks and chainsawing trees but the volunteers brought in by the 
friends of the colorado trail foundation did the real work neill 
said 
the trail begins at waterton canyon southwest of denver and 
climbs gradually over kenosha pass to breckenridge then it wends 
its way toward copper mountain near leadville and past a cluster of 
14000foot peaks west of buena vista and salida 
it turns southwest near saguache and veers toward molas pass 
near 11000footelevation silverton before dropping into the 
animas river drainage in the san juan mountains to durango in 
southwestern colorado 
the trail has been a struggle since its inception in 1973 when 
bill lucas then regional forester in denver and a group of hikers 
hashed out the idea one evening 
the forest service was being criticized for providing only the 
extremes of recreation rugged wilderness treks or roadside 
camping 
lucas idea was to use trails to link major tourist centers a 
hut system would be developed so hikers would not have to lug tents 
and stoves 
the huts are still a long way off neill said 
at first plans called for the colorado trail to be finished in 
1978 two years after it was launched as one of the states 
centennialyear projects the foundation bearing its name collected 
its first 150000 easily including a 100000 grant from the 
denverbased gates foundation 
but the foundation did not get anything done because of 
unrealistic expectations said mayo butch sontermeyer a 
fort collins lawyer who served on the foundation board from its 
beginning 
about the time the foundation sort of fell apart gudy gaskill 
of evergreen who had been involved from the beginning decided to 
take charge of the volunteer effort 
gaskill now 61 organized crews to clear a mile of trail a 
week by using volunteer labor she and the colorado mountain club 
got the work done for 500 a mile compared with the 8000 per 
mile she estimated it would cost the forest service 
you cant say enough about gudys leadership neill said 
she can outwalk outrun and outwork anybody half her age i 
know because she did it to me 
id call it her fanatical attachment to a dream she got 
things moving again and the bulk of the trail work has been done in 
the last four years since she former gov richard lamm and 
then regional forester jim torrence got things rolling again 
gaskill couldnt be reached for an interview this week because 
she was out hiking her trail she was expected to reach durango in 
time for a dedication ceremony saturday at the junction creek 
trailhead five miles northwest of town 
a second ceremony sunday at waterton canyon near denver is to 
feature the arrival of four durango residents who have spent the 
last two weeks running the trail 
in a previous interview gaskill said the trail is a historical 
route showing what happened in colorado 
it goes by record devastation such as climax open pit 
molybdenum mine timber cuts and burned areas as well as splendid 
pristine areas she said 
it shows the whole spectrum of the backcountry she said 
there are areas close to historical sites and others close to 
manmade environmental damage as well as reforestation sites where 
major forest fires occurred we go near or through three ghost 
towns and three mining towns

jesse jackson on friday began to fulfill his 
pledge of democratic unity but warned michael dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen that he is prepared to turn on the street heat to make 
sure they heed his followers agenda 
in a dramatic meeting with several hundred supporters jackson 
presented the newly nominated dukakisbentsen ticket with 
magnanimous words of praise and assured the delegates it is in 
order and it is right to support this ticket because of our access 
to it and relationship with it 
but jackson also cited historical precedent that social change 
comes from a combination of leadership and street heat 
he promised that through registering millions of voters this 
year there will be enough heat to cook our meat and enough heat 
for george bush to get out of the kitchen 
to dukakis and bentsen jackson said somberly you ask us 
trust you all that we can ask of anyone is that they not betray 
that trust 
he told his supporters 
i feel hopeful i feel secure confident you will be 
protected in your role in the campaign in the newly expanded 
democratic national committee and in the role i choose to serve 
one that is supportive one that is respected and thats enough 
he added that he and his supporters had gained respect and 
access and weve never had those two things before 
the jackson delegates reacted warmly to dukakis but were more 
subdued during bentsens brief remarks 
dukakis recalled that bentsen had earned his civil rights 
stripes years ago as one of the two senators who voted to kill the 
poll tax 
dukakis then appealed for the groups support 
were going to need you we want you we cant win without 
you dukakis said 
rep ron dellums dcalif set a tone of acceptance for 
dukakis the congressman delivered a moving tribute to jackson and 
said that while the group had wanted jackson in the white house 
last night i saw a man mount the podium and react to jesse 
jackson with dignity and respect unheralded 
the room erupted in applause and cheers of duke duke in 
the first sign that the ice was being broken for dukakis who 
lauded jackson and his family in a speech thursday night 
jackson introduced dukakis to the room as a man ive come to 
know and respect a man ive come to know in great detail and 
love because of his own sensitivity to family and the people 
walking a line in which he tried to build enthusiasm for dukakis 
at the same time as he put the nominee on notice that pressure for 
his own agenda would continue jackson said 
i bring to you the man i intend to watch up close on a cold 
day jan 20 1989 when he becomes and deserves to become the next 
president of the united states of america 
jackson emotionally noted dukakis wish that his immigrant 
father could have seen him nominated for the presidency 
with eyes glistening and a catch in his voice jackson said that 
by the same token i wish dr martin luther king could have 
been here for the democratic convention that saw jackson come in 
a respectable second to dukakis 
acknowledging that some of his backers were bitterly 
disappointed when dukakis did not pick him for his running mate 
jackson said the victory lies not in what gov dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen can do for us the victory lies in the fact that our minds 
have changed about ourselves and our reasonable expectations have 
been expanded 
he reiterated that he does not want a job or title in a dukakis 
administration or campaign instead he said i want to serve 
be free to serve at my own pace free to support free to 
challenge

an attorney for the christic institute filed formal 
notice friday that he will appeal the dismissal of a 24 million 
lawsuit against some irancontra figures alleging gunsfordrugs 
deals and a 1984 terrorist bombing 
the christic institute will appeal to the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals a june 23 ruling by chief us district judge 
james lawrence king that the plaintiffs journalists tony avirgan 
and martha honey had failed to prove their allegations said 
attorney daniel sheehan 
the group is representing the journalists who filed suit 
against 29 people including richard secord and albert hakim 
contra leader adolfo calero former cia deputy director of 
operations theodore shackley and retired major general and 
anticommunist crusader john k singlaub 
the bottom line is that something in excess of 90 percent of 
summary judgments by trial judges are reversed said sheehan 
the major purpose of the appeal is to get the case reinstituted 
and expand the scope of the trial 
sheehan said he has 10 days to file the appeal 
the suit was filed in may 1986 six months before the 
irancontra affair became public many of the people it brought to 
light such as secord hakim calero and singlaub have been 
indicted or forced to appear before congressional committees 
investigating that case 
the suit involved heroin smuggling from laos the phoenix 
assassination program in vietnam the bay of pigs fiasco cocaine 
smuggling from colombia illegal contra arms running bombings 
threats disappearances all to push what the plaintiffs believed 
was an activist rightwing ideology 
it alleges that shackley and others using drug profits 
assassinated officials first in vietnam then iran nicaragua and 
other nations 
the key event in the suit was the may 1984 bombing of a news 
conference held by contra commander eden pastora in la penca 
nicaragua three journalists and five pastora supporters died 
avirgan was hurt and his camera damaged in the explosion allowing 
him to file a civil damage suit under federal law 
the suit charged the bombing was arranged by shackley contra 
leaders and others angry that pastora refused to join 
antisandinista groups he considered too close to the cia and 
deposed nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza debayle 
an attorney for singlaub thomas spencer jr alleged the 
lawyers who filed the suit were guilty of bad faith and asked king 
this week to penalize them he said the christic institute as well 
as other plaintiffs should be liable for more than 275000 in 
legal fees and 88000 in expenses for singlaub alone 
total fees for all defendants have been estimated at more than 
800000

a young bald eagle raised in 
massachusetts as part of an attempt to reestablish a breeding 
population has been found shot dead in west virginia officials 
said 
three of 35 bald eagles the state has raised and released since 
1982 at the 38squaremile quabbin reservoir in western 
massachusetts are known to have died said state ornithologist 
bradford g blodget 
one died of mercury poisoning and the other drowned after being 
caught in a leghold trap he said the carcass of the latest 
victim and that of a second bald eagle were found late last month 
in a sinkhole in a mountainous portion of west virginia he said 
the birds were believed shot in early 1987 the massachusetts 
eagle was still carrying a radio transmitter attached to its 
tailfeathers when it was released july 12 1986 he said 
under federal law the maximum penalty for killing a bald eagle 
is a 20000 fine and a year in jail 
blodget said a number of eagles have been shot in the isolated 
sheep farming area of west virginia 
a lot of people erroneously believe that eagles kill young 
lambs he said they dont they mainly feed on carrion and 
fish 
young eagles can travel for thousands of miles in the first few 
years of their life he said but most end up nesting where they 
were raised 
two pairs of eagles including some birds raised at the 
reservoir built nests at the quabbin this spring the first eagles 
to do so in at least 80 years but both pairs were too young to lay 
eggs blodget said 
this summer the state division of fisheries and wildlife is 
rearing the last batch of six young eagles in the 7yearold 
project those birds will be released next month

consumer prices rose at a moderate annual rate 
of 42 percent in june with the effects of the farm belt drought 
showing up clearly only in poultry and egg prices the government 
reported friday 
the labor department said retail prices overall rose just 03 
percent last month the same as in may food price rises held to a 
06 percent gain despite the biggest surge in poultry and egg 
prices since august 1986 when the nation was in the midst of the 
another drought 
offsetting increases on grocery shelves were a 02 percent 
decline in energy prices and a 03 percent drop in clothing costs 
id say the report is good news it clearly shows that 
inflation is not getting out of hand it has accelerated over the 
last year or so but very gradually and very unevenly said 
lawrence chimerine chairman of the wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
forecasting firm 
the 03 percent seasonally adjusted gain in the consumer price 
index left the annualized inflation rate for the first half of 1988 
at 44 percent the same as for all of 1987 
the index itself stood at 1180 in june meaning that a 
selection of goods costing 100 during a 198284 base period would 
have cost 118 last month 50 cents more than in the preceding 
month and 450 more than a year ago 
in santa barbara calif where president reagan is vacationing 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the data continues 
to show no significant acceleration of inflation from the 4 percent 
range that has prevailed in recent years more good news from a 
republican administration has given you 68 straight months of 
economic recovery 
inflation worries have dogged financial markets in recent 
months with particular concern focusing on rising factory 
operating rates and a tightening labor supply 
last month factories operated closer to capacity than at any 
time in eight years raising fears that strong demand will free 
manufacturers to raise prices meanwhile unemployment fell to 53 
percent a 14year low and heightened concern that workers will be 
able to get higher wages 
the bond market showed little reaction to fridays inflation 
report with interest rates slipping a bit in early trading in 
advance of the report most economists expected a 04 percent rise 
with some correctly predicting a 03 percent increase 
since late march the federal reserve has pushed shortterm 
interest rates up by about a percentage point and its chairman 
alan greenspan warned last week that the central bank stood ready 
to tighten again if inflation heats up 
richard w rahn chief economist of the us chamber of 
commerce said in a statement that fridays inflation report shows 
that the interest rate increases are unjustified 
is anyone at the fed listening does anyone down there look at 
the evidence he asked 
in a separate report the labor department said that americans 
average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation were 
unchanged in june following a decline of 06 percent in may and an 
increase of 12 percent in april 
in june the 03 percent increase in consumer prices was offset 
by an identical rise in average hours worked per week the average 
hourly pay was unchanged 
the various adjustments left americans inflationadjusted 
earnings 02 percent below a year ago 
grocery prices in june were led by a 54 percent increase in 
poultry and an even steeper 66 percent gain in egg costs cereal 
and bakery prices not yet showing the full effects of the drought 
were up 04 percent 
cooking oil prices were up 04 percent while dairy products 
fell 02 percent and the price of fruits and vegetables edged down 
01 percent restaurant meal prices went up 04 percent 
donald ratajczak an economist at georgia state university in 
atlanta said poultry and eggs are among the first categories to 
show the effects of higher feed prices 
baked goods are slower to react because most food companies have 
annual flour contracts he said 
ratajczak who conducts his own price surveys said he had 
expected meat prices to fall as farmers stepped up slaughtering 
rather than pay for expensive feed instead pork prices jumped 12 
percent and beef was up 13 percent 
sometime between now and the end of barbecue season the 
supermarkets are going to have to give us some specials because 
they have a lot of meat starting to pile up he said 
the department gave these other details of june price increases 
clothing prices fell for the second month in a row after sharp 
jumps in march and april analysts attributed the decline to large 
markdowns in prices of womens clothing 
prices for infants and toddlers clothing were off 10 percent 
followed by a 08 percent drop in the costs of womens and girls 
clothing and a 01 percent dip in mens and boys clothing 
gasoline prices fell 09 percent and fuel oil was down 06 
percent while natural gas and electricity costs gained 04 percent 
housing costs rose 03 percent the same as in may and april 
medical care expenses were up 04 percent less than in recent 
months but 64 percent greater than at this time last year 
new car prices rose 03 percent faster than the 01 percent 
gains of april and may 
excluding the effects of the volatile food and energy 
categories retail prices rose 04 percent in june double mays 
02 percent increase

nasa said friday it is delaying the 
launch pad testfiring of space shuttle discoverys main engines 
two days until july 30 
the decision was made after shuttle managers reviewed 
preparations and concluded that all elements were not ready 
including a hazardous gas detection system that is not completely 
checked out 
the 20second firing of the main engines is considered critical 
to certifying discovery for the first shuttle flight since the 
challenger explosion killed seven astronauts on jan 28 1986 
it will test modifications made in the engines and provide 
countdown experience for the launch team 
nasa officials said the delay in the testfiring could postpone 
for a day or two the launch now scheduled for early september 
however the status of the launch date is very much in doubt as 
engineers are puzzling over how to fix a small gas leak in a 
steering engine system that is separate from the main engines 
they hope to make the repair on the pad and avoid rolling 
discovery back to a hangar a move that could delay the flight by 
as much as two months 
experts are considering several ways to reach the inaccessible 
leak from cutting a hole through the cargo bay wall to running a 
snakelike tube through the gas line in an effort to plug the leak

new yorks top environmental official friday 
said there is no single source for the medical debris and other 
trash that has washed up on beaches in the new york city area in 
recent weeks 
the waste may have come through the sanitation system from 
untreated sewage illegal dumping littering from boats or some 
combination of all these said environmental conservation 
commissioner thomas jorling 
an unusual extended wind pattern also is partly to blame for 
washing the debris ashore he said in a preliminary report on the 
waste that has forced the closing of miles of popular beach in past 
weeks 
there is no single answer that puts this thing behind us 
jorling said 
the presence of garbage such as cigarette butts and condoms 
mixed in with medical debris suggests the debris had more than one 
source jorling said 
he called it extremely difficult to trace the waste which 
includes syringes rubber gloves and at least 10 vials of blood 
one vial out of seven tested has shown the presence of the aids 
virus he said three more brought in thursday were still being 
tested he said 
peter slocum health department spokesman said none of the 
vials tested thus far had any identifiable markings 
even if investigators find markings on the medical waste its 
doubtful theyll be able to find and prosecute illegal dumpers he 
said 
its a very tricky case to make jorling said you start 
with an isolated blood vial on the beach some hundred miles or more 
from any possible point of origin and taking that blood vial back 
through steps in a chain is a very difficult investigative burden 
to carry 
on thursday officials in monmouth county nj identified an 
asbury park sewage plant as the likely source of pollution that has 
plagued four new jersey seashore communities since last week 
beaches in asbury park ocean grove bradley beach and 
avonbythesea were closed by high levels of fecal bacteria in the 
water

a blood bank has lost an effort to 
protect the identity of a donor whose blood may have been tainted 
with the aids virus 
the south carolina supreme court dismissed an appeal of an order 
requiring the carolinageorgia blood bank to identify the donor 
whose blood was used in a transfusion for daisy lee young 
mrs young 74 was being treated for aidsrelated symptoms when 
she died at spartanburg regional medical center earlier this year 
lawsuits filed by her husband and her estate allege she acquired 
aids from a transfusion received at self memorial hospital in 
greenwood after a 1985 hip operation the suits accuse the blood 
bank and the hospital of negligence 
circuit judge frank mcgowan jr ruled in may that the blood bank 
had to release the name of the donor the blood bank appealed 
saying the donors right to privacy outweighed the plaintiffs 
interests 
the supreme court refused the case july 8 
the blood bank now is asking that mcgowan to limit the questions 
lawyers can ask the donor and that the donor be referred to as john 
doe in any court documents 
scientists say a blood screening test that came into use in 1985 
has virtually eliminated the risk of aids from a transfusion

michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen the democrats 
shinynew national ticket began the general election campaign 
friday with the boost of high praise from jesse jackson republican 
george bush immediately tried to drive a wedge into the ticket 
citing tremendous differences between the running mates 
with the weeks peaceful and unified national convention as his 
base dukakis crossed the atlanta street that had divided his 
campaign from jacksons to ask for enthusiastic support 
were going to need you we want you we cant win without 
you dukakis told several hundred cheering jackson supporters in 
a hotel ballroom we have 110 days and i hope we can enlist 
every single one of you in this cause 
then dukakis and bentsen headed to texas bentsens home state 
to start a threeday crosscountry swing that was designed to be a 
fast start for the democrats effort to win the white house back 
from the republicans 
for his part jackson lavished praise on dukakis even more 
generously than he had in his campaign valedictory to the 
convention tuesday night 
the democratic presidential nominee is a man ive come to 
know to respect a man ive come to love because of his own 
sensitivity to family jackson said i bring to you a man i 
plan to watch up close when he becomes the next president 
of the united states michael dukakis 
amid cheers of duke duke duke jackson promised excitment 
for the democratic ticket in the fall and glory in the future 
it is in order and it is right to support this ticket because 
of our access to it and our relaionship with it jackson said 
we have every reason to be hopeful to be excited to know that 
we are close to where we are going a long way from where we 
startedand in our lifetime you and i will be in the white 
house 
dukakis delivered on a key jackson demand friday as the 
democratic national committee added new officials and new members 
to expand the party a majority of the new members were jackson 
backers 
jackson repeated that he wants no title from dukakis i want 
to serve free to serve at my own pace free to serve free to 
challenge 
in milwaukee bush praised dukakis acceptance speech at the 
thursday night convention session but suggested there might be 
internal problems for the democratic ticket 
i thought he gave a very good speech bush told reporters at 
an italian festival he did a very good job 
the republican vice president has gone out of his way in recent 
days to praise fellow texan bentsen as a conservative even as he 
has painted dukakis as a liberal 
the differences are enormous bush said between the 
democratic presidential and vicepresidential candidates 
bush told reporters that an effective use for lloyd bentsen 
would be for him to persuade dukakis to change his positions on gun 
control prison furlough programs and many other issues 
bentsen has also drawn praise from jackson desite their many 
differences on the issues but jackson warned friday that bentsen 
bears a heavy burden that accompanies the support from more liberal 
democrats 
in a real sense your occasion is now jackson told bentsen 
you ask us to trust you all we can ask of anyone is that they 
not betray that trust 
even as jackson praised dukakis and bentsen he promised them 
that there would be differences in the democratic family saying 
the progressive agenda will be won with a combination of street 
heat and leadership 
he promised dukakis there will be enough heat to cook our 
meat and enough heat for george bush to get out of the kitchen 
dukakis was quick to point out that he and his running mate have 
strong records on civil rights 
the massachusetts governor recalled the civil rights struggle 
and spoke of his own experience traveling to washington dc in 
1953 and seeing the intense segregation of the nations capital at 
that time 
then he emphasized that bentsen as a texas congressman had 
voted in 1948 to against the poll tax that was used to deny voting 
rights to blacks

take my deli please comedian henny 
youngman implored friday joining a pastrami war declared by his 
colleague jackie mason 
go figure by me moving from one deli to another it would 
cause so much tumult mason said friday 
in most places they have wars because of religion race or 
creed only in new york could they have a war over pastrami 
it supposedly began with a tiff over chicken soup from the 
carnegie deli a local landmark used in the woody allen movie 
broadway danny rose and youngmans favorite breakfast haunt 
a delivery boy from the carnegie who barely spoke english and 
didnt know who jackie mason was wanted to charge him for a 
delivery of chicken soup said a spokesman for the carnegie who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
when i heard about it we sent up a whole pot of soup said 
carnegie coowner milton parker 
however when mason asked parker to close the carnegie so he 
could hold a private party there parker declined 
that said youngman was a mistake you get national 
advertising he said 
mason who is on broadway in a oneman show retaliated by 
staging a showbusiness bash at the rival stage deli which like 
the carnegie is on seventh avenue near 54th street guests 
including joan rivers jane alexander and phantom of the opera star 
michael crawford were treated to fish corned beef pastrami 
turkey and beef brisket 
mason had my pastrami and told me its better than the 
carnegies said stage owner louis auerbach 
thats baloney said parker the only thing he ever ate 
here was chicken matzo ball soup or borsch 
then things got really ugly auerbach struck below the belt by 
revealing that the carnegies famous new york pastrami was actually 
made in secaucus nj 
new york water its the best water in the country 
proclaimed auerbach 63 noting that his pastrami is pickled in 
that precious elixir 
the new jersey water happens to be good not quite as good as 
new york but our change in formula offsets that parker 
contended 
every deli likes to brag about their own notes youngman 
who remains everfaithful to the carnegies nova nova scotia 
salmon and cream cheese on a bagel 
mason said the trouble started after the carnegies popular 
coowner leo steiner died last year at the funeral youngman 
eulogized steiner as the deli lama 
i loved leo steiner and ever since he died its not the same 
at the carnegie mason said through a spokesman mark kane 
the large front table where oldtime comics swapped shtick over 
blintzes has been replaced by a fourtier revolving cake stand 
stocked by a new pastry chef 
still i always have a table there said youngman 
anywhere i want to make it 
i lost my wife last year i go there to cut the 
lonesomeness said youngman i invite different people milton 
berle and red buttons and jack carter 
revenge is a very funny thing he added years ago after 
the stage changed hands they wouldnt take a message for me that 
was the end of them for me

president reagan imposed trade 
sanctions against brazil on friday in retaliation for that 
countrys denial of patent protections for us pharmaceutical 
products 
acting under a section of the trade act of 1974 reagan started 
a process which will lead to sanctions against 200 million worth 
of yet unspecified brazilian imports 
reagans move came after what the white house said was a 
yearslong quest by the us government and the american 
pharmaceutical industry to persuade brazil to enact adequate 
patent protection 
brazil has been unwilling to abolish a longstanding industrial 
property code which holds that pharmaceutical products and the 
pharmaceutical manufacturing process are ineligible for patent 
protection 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association petitioned the 
government for an investigation arguing that brazils refusal to 
protect intellectual property rights has restricted us commerce 
and cost american pharmaceutical manufacturers more than 160 
million from 197986 
an administration official commenting on condition of 
anonymity said the loss to us producers is now running at about 
36 million a year 
we regret that it is necessary to impose trade sanctions in 
this matter white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in a 
statement read to reporters here as reagan neared the end of a 
weeklong vacation 
but the us cannot tolerate the piracy of its intellectual 
property he said over the past three years we have 
challenged the infringement of us intellectual property rights 
and denial of rights throughout the world 
fitzwater said this policy has resulted in strengthened patent 
laws in many foreign countries he said this progress stands in 
stark contrast to brazils lack of action in this area 
by denying this basic commercial right fitzwater said 
brazil permits unauthorized copying of pharmaceutical products 
and processes that were invented by us firms this not only 
deprives american companies of sales it discourages investment in 
the research and development of new drugs 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers assocation said it welcomed 
reagans move the associations president gerald j mossinghoff 
said the united states cannot permit its pharmaceutical industry 
to sustain substantial losses as a result of brazils refusal to 
recognize patent rights for pharmaceutical products and processes 
the united states had come close to slapping trade sanctions on 
brazil earlier this year but backed away when that country 
responded to complaints about its policies regarding importation of 
software products 
the administration official said the sanctions would more likely 
take the form of tariffs against 200 million in brazilian imports 
as opposed to embargoing 200 million in that countrys products 
reagans order triggers a process through which the us 
government will hold public hearings to determine which brazilian 
products will be affected by the punitive measures 
fitzwater said the administration had given brazil every 
opportunity to change its patent policy he also said that while 
he did not believe brazil would retaliate thats always a 
possibility 
reagan has only occasionally invoked sections of the trade laws 
to retaliate against countries suspected of engaging in unfair 
trade practices and congress is near completion of legislation 
that would revamp american trade laws 
reagan vetoed an earlier version citing several factors 
including a provision requiring major employers to give workers at 
least 60 days notice of layoffs and plant closings that provision 
now has been passed as separate legislation by both the house and 
senate via vetoproof margins 
the white house has not said specifically whether reagan would 
veto the new plantclosing bill although that is believed to be 
his intention nor has it said whether he would veto the revised 
trade bill which is still pending in the senate 
last year reagan imposed sanctions against japan accusing it 
of dumping electronic products into the united states at 
belowmarket prices and of refusing to open its own markets to us 
computer components and other such products

a federal judge who threatened a lawyer with 
jail for using her maiden name in court is known for threatening 
attorneys with arrest and calling them names including dumb 
jew lawyers said friday 
senior us district justice hubert teitelbaum 73 prompted 
feminists to demand his resignation when he recently ordered 
attorney barbara wolvovitz to use her husbands last name and not 
use ms during a race discrimination trial 
attorneys who have tried cases before teitelbaum said friday his 
courtroom antics began years ago 
hes very bright hes very knowledgeable in the law but hes 
very domineering he takes over your case and tries it for you 
said pittsburgh attorney harvey daniels 
teitelbaum a former us attorney and fbi agent who first took 
the bench in 1971 could not be reached for comment friday there 
were no answers at either his office or home telephones he has 
consistently refused to talk to the press 
leonard sharon a former pittsburgh attorney now practicing in 
auburn maine said teitelbaum ordered him arrested and called him 
a liar in 1984 when he tried to file a petition which the judge 
claimed contained erroneous information 
i didnt lie but if he has facts that say i did someone else 
should have decided the issue sharon 42 said friday he 
cant pitch and call balls and strikes at the same time 
sharon said his wife claudia also an attorney entered the 
courtroom carrying their infant just in time to see marshals 
surround him 
teitelbaum told her you get out of the courtroom and said 
something to the effect that she should be home watching the 
baby sharon said 
the judge vacated his order 
sharon said he later was subpoenaed to testify before a federal 
judicial panel investigating a complaint against teitelbaum filed 
by stanley preiser a former pittsburgh lawyer who now practices in 
charleston wva and boca raton fla 
sharon said he doesnt know the outcome of the investigation 
and preiser said he was prohibited by court rules from disclosing 
it 
preiser said teitelbaum called him a dumb jew during an 
august 1985 hearing when he asked the judge to reschedule a case 
around a jewish holiday 
he said it was the first time i had known you were jewish 
because i have never met a dumb jew before recalled george 
mahfood presiers cocounsel in the case 
i was stunned and astounded said preiser 60 that 
courtroom was totally different from any other american courtroom i 
had been in before 
teitelbaum stepped down from the case after the two attorneys 
asked the 3rd us circuit court of appeals to disqualify him 
on jan 19 1973 teitelbaum sent federal marshals to the 
allegheny county courthouse for attorney allen brunwasser who was 
finishing a trial in the local court as soon as the trial ended 
brunwasser was escorted to teitelbaum who jailed him for 48 hours 
for contempt for not attending a hearing scheduled at the same time 
brunwasser served the time but the 3rd circuit cleared 
brunwasser of the contempt conviction 
there is no more powerful man than an american judge sitting 
in his courtroom brunwasser said he is a king 
meanwhile ms wolvovitzs clients charles gavin and william 
sutton who lost their race discrimination case against ppg 
industries inc said friday they will act as their own attorneys 
in an appeal 
they claim the jury was prejudiced by teitelbaums comments to 
ms wolvovitz who they said promised teitelbaum she would not cite 
the msmrs flap on appeals and wont represent them on that 
ground

the american bar association is asking philippine 
president corazon aquino to condemn the slayings of two 
humanrights lawyers there 
lance lindblom a representative of the 340000member group 
was meeting thursday and friday with the free legal assistance 
group of the philippines and planned to deliver a letter signed by 
aba president robert maccrate said craig babb of the abas 
washington dc office 
the aba letter specifically mentions alfonso a surigao jr who 
often represents military detainees and was killed by gunmen june 
24 at his cebu city home and emmanuel mendoza 57 who was 
ambushed in his car july 2 
we respectfully urge that you publicly condemn these recent 
attacks against human rights lawyers and that you order thorough 
investigations it says citing reports that the philippine 
military may have been involved in the murder of surigao 
the american bar association is deeply concerned over the 
murder of mr surigao and mr mendoza and the harassment and 
killings of several other lawyers in the philippines over the past 
few months maccrate wrote 
we are further concerned that to our knowledge there have 
been no arrests in these cases nor in the earlier killings of 
three other civilrights lawyers he wrote 
baab said friday he did not know if lindblom had delivered the 
letter to mrs aquino it asks her to inform the aba of progress in 
the investigations 
the aba has sent similar letters to other countries since 1975

censors are debating whether to ban sex and 
serious crimes from chinese movies and are considering establishing 
the countrys first rating system to keep children from seeing some 
films altogether 
the rating system would protect younger children from movies 
that could harm their healthy minds the official china daily 
and outlook magazine reported 
a proposed law now would mark the first time since communist 
china was established in 1949 that explicit standards have been set 
about what can and cannot be portrayed in a chinese movie 
in the past censorship changed with the political climate of 
the country when the country was ruled by hardline leftists 
censorship was quite strict when moderates took command 
censorship was relatively lax 
outlook quoted chen haosu vice minister of radio film and 
television as saying the regulations were needed to eliminate the 
ambiguity surrounding artistic expression 
if theres no law then you can interfere with anything 
haosu was quoted as saying 
but some artists in china say they thrive on the ambiguity 
preferring to work within the present vague situation where a 
liberal turn in the political wind might allow a controversial work 
to slip by 
china produces more than 100 feature films a year and boasts the 
largest movie industry in the world employing 500000 workers 
in the 10 years since china began to open to the west about a 
dozen movies have been killed by chinas censors ai zhisheng 
the minister of radio film and television told outlook 
others have been revised with the help of the film company 
he said 
outlook said censors agreed chinese films should not hurt china 
or the unity of its numerous nationalities nor should they distort 
history or exert an unhealthy influence on the morals of the people 
but it said censors disagreed on nudity and crime 
an article of the proposed law bans naked bodies and sex scenes 
from all movies but outlook said some officials argued nudity and 
sex should be forbidden only when they have no relation to the plot 
another proposed article forbids graphic descriptions of 
criminal acts because officials fear they might trigger copycat 
crimes outlook said some officials favored limiting the clause to 
only serious crimes such as rape and drug trafficking 
outlook said some officials were also pushing to institute a 
rating system for movies 
there are many movies that arent good for children or that 
shouldnt be seen without the presence of an older family member 
chen was quoted as saying he said china needed to establish a 
rating system as soon as possible

author john hersey apologized friday for using 
uncredited material from another writers book in a new yorker 
article on james agee 
hersey said he should have credited some of his sources 
especially laurence bergreens james agee a life the most 
comprehensive and thoroughly researched biography of agee so far 
published 
bergreen had told his lawyer to complain to the new yorker and 
to houghton mifflin which had commissioned the piece as an 
introduction to a new edition of agees let us now praise famous 
men 
houghton mifflin said in a statement mr hersey feels that 
several of the sources on which he draws for facts about mr agees 
life beyond his own recollections should be credited and they 
will be 
agee a critic novelist journalist and screenwriter died in 
1955 
the facts that a biographer or historian digs up dont belong 
to him they belong to the public anybody has a right to use 
them hersey said friday in a telephone interview from his home 
on marthas vineyard 
but the one thing that is protected is the mode of 
expression he continued if in the course of a 12000word 
article i used a dozen or so words i certainly did not 
intend to steal them from him 
he said he thought there was a fine line between ones right 
to use material and ones respect for the work of another writer 
and that his offense was not great in terms of normal practice 
bergreen said he came across the july 18 issue of the new yorker 
during a lunch break and because i had interviewed hersey for my 
biography i turned to read it with considerable interest 
as i read it i discovered that there were a number of passages 
which were very closely modeled on my own in the book there were 
numerous instances where he was using my phrasing my choice of 
words and structure and so on 
with the exception of an introductory anecdote about agee the 
rest of the piece which was a rather long one amounted to a 
condensation of my biography bergreen said 
for example bergreens book described a scene between agee and 
alma mailman his second wife alma once tied a blue ribbon in 
agees hair as if he were a poodle forgetting the bow was in 
place he opened the door to converse with a delegation of church 
ladies who had come acalling 
in the new yorker article hersey wrote one day alma 
pretended that jim was a poodle and tied a blue ribbon in his 
hair some church ladies came to call and jim the poodle dressed 
for showing went to the door and let them in 
hersey confirmed that he had written the editors of the new 
yorker saying in part i very much regret any discourtesy on my 
part or any distress caused to mr bergreen or others by his 
omission of credit 
rhonda pinzer the public relations director of the new yorker 
said the next issue would contain a department of amplification 
which is how the magazine deals with such questions she could not 
confirm that it would contain herseys letter 
hersey who won the pulitzer prize for fiction in 1945 with his 
a bell for adano is the author of more than 20 books including 
hiroshima the child buyer and the war lover 
bergreen also wrote look now pay later the rise of network 
broadcasting and is working on a biography of irving berlin

it used to be endearing but the charm has 
worn off for many boulder residents whose backyards and gardens 
have become the favorite haunts of increasing numbers of deer 
when we started studying the deer in 1982 we thought of them 
as seasonal and transient but it seems we have a resident 
population now having fawns in peoples backyards and sleeping 
under decks said laurie kuelthau state department of wildlife 
district manager of southern boulder county 
about 160 deer were killed by cars last year within boulders 
city limits an area of only about 16 square miles 
city council has received so many complaints of gardens ruined 
by hungry deer that it plans to take up the issue tuesday 
possible ways to curb the deer range from relocating them to 
killing them and donating the venison to food banks but city 
officials say relocating the deer would cost 400 apiece and could 
cause 80 percent mortality 
mountain lions which normally hunt deer wont thin the deer 
population because they dont like to hunt so close to humans 
in the past 10 years the number of deer in the boulder area has 
swelled to double the deer population in the rest of the front 
range 50 to 60 per square mile 
brian peck a ranger and naturalist with boulder mountain parks 
says the deer population has grown so quickly partly because the 
city of about 100000 people is built on several deer migration 
routes 
in addition he said the deer discovered that roses tulips 
raspberries and other plants in suburban gardens are tastier than 
mountain mahogany and wild grasses 
many residents still consider the deer evidence of a rapport 
with wildlife in a town with a reputation for environmental 
consciousness some people used to put out food and salt licks to 
attract the deer but the city council passed a law in 1985 
forbidding that 
kuelthau says most complaints are from gardeners who in some 
parts of the city report as many as seven deer in their yards at 
one time 
in march marie aragon was fined 200 after she killed a deer in 
her table mesa backyard she said she feared that the deer 
threatened her two toddlers and she disliked cleaning up deer 
droppings 
but the deer have their defenders 
a 1987 city council survey found that 58 percent of those 
responding wanted the deer to be left alone while 28 percent said 
something should be done about them 
deer are one of the reasons i like boulder said karen 
martingale you lose some of your vegetation but thats one of 
the things you put up with if you live here

exactly two years after the us house 
voted to remove him from the bench an impeached federal judge who 
served 17 months in prison for tax evasion sought friday to resume 
practicing law in federal court 
the nevada supreme court in november cleared harry claiborne to 
practice at the state level and his attorney david goldwater on 
friday repeated the argument he used there that claiborne has been 
punished enough 
he should be allowed the basic civil right to make a living 
and to be restored the dignity his profession affords him 
goldwater added 
jay sourwine presidentelect of the nevada bar association 
told us district judge robert broomfield the claiborne affair 
has caused a great deal of damage to the bar and to the state court 
system we urge you dont let it do damage to this court 
broomfield of phoenix ariz took the matter under advisement 
and gave no indication when he might rule 
i think i have paid a price for a debt i feel i didnt owe 
claiborne 71 told reporters i was denied parole twice i did 
the mandatory maximum sentence that i could do 
you dont go to a minumumsecurity prison unless youre 
parolable i was an unusual case i guess 
he also joked about one of goldwaters comments 
ill always make a living he said even if i have to dig 
ditches 
claiborne was convicted of failing to report 106651 on his 
1979 and 1980 income tax returns the us house voted 4060 two 
years ago friday to impeach claiborne who was removed from office 
after an october 1986 senate trial he was the first federal judge 
banished from office by congress in 50 years 
claiborne charged at the time of his impeachment trial and again 
friday that he was the victim of a government vendetta because he 
attacked agencies like the fbi and justice department strike force 
while on the bench he alleged misconduct by federal agents and 
bias on the part of us district judge walter hoffman who 
conducted his 1984 income tax trial and sentenced him to prison 
the state supreme court in its 163page decision in november 
said claiborne shouldnt be punished any further 
he was named a federal judge in 1978

coauthor caitlin ryan social worker and researcher 
the national lesbian health care survey undertaken with some 
federal funding was presented at the weeklong 10th national 
lesbian and gay health conference and aids forum which ends 
tuesday 
the survey by ryan and coauthor judith bradford of virginia 
commonwealth university was conducted by sending 10page 
questionnaires to 4600 women the 2000 respondents from 
throughout the nation ranged from 17 to 80 years old 
eighty percent of the respondents were between 2544 and about 
70 percent were in professional or managerial jobs 46 percent of 
participants had one child or more or were childless but wanted to 
have one most lived in metropolitan areas 
ryan said she had no error margin for the results because the 
study was the first of its kind and because no one knows the size 
of the base population of lesbians 
the data indicate that lesbians are very much like 
heterosexual women in their concerns about health care and mental 
health concerns bradford told an audience of about 200 people 
who attended the survey presentation 
but it is quite different as far as access to nondiscriminate 
care and the level of stress she said 
among the studys findings 
substance abuse among lesbians becomes greater as they age 
especially among the 5055 age group the older lesbians tend to 
be very isolated ryan said their partner may die and they 
become very depressed and turn to substance abuse 
more than onethird of those surveyed said they were physically 
abused as a child 
half said they have been verbally attacked and 8 percent 
reported they had been physically attacked because of their 
homosexuality 
fifteen percent said they lost jobs because they were lesbians 
seventyfive percent said they relied on some form of 
counseling 
the percentage of us who are worried about jobs is 
considerably higher than the concern about jobs expressed by 
heterosexual women bradford said 
where we found the great differences is in the area of mental 
health in stressrelated issues bradford said 
this does not surprise us but we can document it we can see 
through our data how health issues that are related to stress are 
greater in our population she said 
the research began with 20000 in funding supplemented later 
by 8000 from the national institute of mental health 
about 1500 homosexual men and women are at the gathering that 
includes a speech scheduled monday by sen edward m kennedy

hurt said one trapper william whidden of osteen i respect 
one if he aint but 2 foot long because i know what he can do to 
my hand

south koreas political leaders said 
friday they will consider a north korean call for parliamentary 
talks on easing military and political tensions on the divided 
korean peninsula 
leaders of the nations four main political parties said they 
would try to produce a united response by the end of next week 
national unification minister lee hongkoo told a national 
assembly committee that the south korean government would favor 
opening the proposed talks as a means of promoting contact with 
north korea 
communist north korea sent an invitation thursday to the south 
korean national assembly for talks with the supreme peoples 
assembly in pyongyang on a nonaggression pact drawn up by the 
north 
in washington state dept spokeswoman phyllis oakley applauded 
the idea 
we believe this could be a very positive development and hope 
the joint assembly meeting will take place she said 
south korean government and opposition leaders said preliminary 
negotiations would be needed to work out the terms and details 
before any agreement could be reached on parliamentary talks 
the political leaders have agreed to consider affirmatively 
the north korean proposal for parliamentary talks said lee 
dongbok chief secretary to the national assembly speaker 
lee said the governing and opposition leaders reached the 
agreement after a briefing by government officials 
no agreement was reached on the agenda or method of the talks 
he said 
kim daejung president of the party for peace and democracy 
said after the meeting we will make efforts to seek an early 
realization of interkorea parliamentary talks 
the north korean proposal called for the legislatures of the two 
koreas to hold joint sessions alternately in their capitals to 
discuss various tensioneasing subjects including nonaggression 
and arms reduction 
the rival koreas have presented a series of what they called 
peace proposals in recent months but none of them was accepted 
by either side on several occasions the two sides even refused to 
receive letters from the other side 
korea was divided by us and soviet forces that ended the 
japanese occupation at the end of world war ii efforts to reunite 
the peninsula failed and separate governments were declared in 1948 
the north invaded south korea in 1950 to start the threeyear 
korean war about 42000 us troops are based in south korea under 
a mutual defense treaty

a year ago beaches were littered 
with carcasses of bottlenose dolphins killed by a disease 
scientist still do not understand 
this summer there have been no widespread reports of stranded 
dolphins but scientists are not yet sure whether that is good news 
were frankly very nervous said robert schoelkopf of 
the marine mammal stranding center based in brigantine nj this 
may simply be a pause 
on wednesday the center recovered a dead bottlenose dolphin 
found on the beach in long branch nj schoelkopf said he ruled 
out old age as a cause of death but was not certain if the mammal 
a female about 8 feet long died from the same malady that killed 
bottlenose dolphins last summer it had been dead about two days 
he said 
brian gorman a spokesman for the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration said it does appear that deaths among 
the bottlenose have subsided compared with last year 
the bad news is we still dont understand what happened last 
year he said 
according to noaas national marine fisheries service more than 
800 of the mammals washed ashore and died beginning a year ago 
gorman said that number could mean as many as 5000 of the animals 
were killed with their bodies being lost at sea 
by aerial survey noaa scientists estimate the east coast 
bottlenose population at 8000 to 10000 before last years 
episode but you have to realize that such surveys border on 
political polls and black magic as far as accuracy or reality 
gorman said 
one thing that has become clear the effect of the deaths on 
the bottlenose population is more profound than we had feared last 
year we now feel that between 20 percent and 50 percent of the 
bottlenose population may have died he said 
schoelkopf agrees 
we use the beach patrol to take a daily count on the animals 
right now our figures on the bottlenose are down by twothirds 
he said 
those declining numbers may explain why there have been so few 
reported strandings of bottlenose both gorman and schoelkopf said 
because there are fewer animals the number of beachings is down 
the bottlenose is the most common of the dolphin species 
traveling along the east coast the mammals which can grow up to 
15 feet and 440 pounds are easily trained and often are featured 
in aquatic shows 
scientists know what killed the dolphins but they dont 
understand why the dolphins suddenly became susceptible to the 
microorganism 
joseph geraci a marine pathologist and veterinarian from the 
ontario veterinary college in guelph headed the research team that 
identified the bacteria as vibrio a common form that flourishes in 
warm water rich in nutrients the bacteria sometimes is associated 
with polluted water and some species cause cholera in humans and 
animals 
you would expect the very young and the very old to be 
affected more by the disease but that is not the case gorman 
said 
it makes no sense its effect on the reproductive population 
could be devastating he said 
gorman recalled that the first indications of something being 
wrong came at the end of july last year so the approach of august 
makes scientists nervous again this year 
weve seen a number of bottlenose again this year with 
barnacles on their dorsal fin the first and only time we saw that 
was last year i just dont know if that indicates a similar 
condition out there well have to wait and see schoelkopf said 
dr ray birdsong an ichthyologist and professor at old dominion 
university in norfolk said the deaths of the dolphins is similar 
to mass killings of inshore fish from diseases of an unknown source 
generally these incidents can be traced to bottom pollutants 
that cause lesions on the fish the bacteria get in those lesions 
and take control he said 
geracis studies of the dolphins showed lesions on the body and 
in the mouths

call em crazy call em goofy call em a 
little bit childish and convention goers gathering this weekend 
just might respond with a pie in your face or a poke in your eyes 
everybody sees a little bit of one or another of the stooges 
in them or theyd like to says frank reighter organizer of 
the second annual three stooges convention in suburban trevose 
fans of the stooges are gathering to buy and sell memorabilia 
reminisce with relatives and associates of the stooges and watch 
some of the 190 shorts and dozens of feature movies the stooges 
made between 1930 and 1965 titles such as dizzy doctors and 
all the worlds a stooge 
a pie fight will break out at some time a shempathon is 
also scheduled a showing of some obscure films starring shemp 
howard after he left the stooges 
in louisiana they showed a shempathon and a lot of people 
showed up thinking it was a shrimpathon said gary lassin 
president of the 2500member 3 stooges fan club the 
lansdalebased sponsor of the threeday convention they have a 
lot of knuckleheads down there 
reighter said he expects 1000 to 1500 people from as far away 
as the west coast and canada to join in the celebration of the 
faceslapping headbutting pratfalling brand of slapstick and 
high jinks that made the stooges famous 
the original three stooges created as foils for vaudeville 
comedian ted healy in the 1920s were morris moe horowitz who 
later changed his name to howard his brother samuel or shemp 
and philadelphia native larry fineberg aka fine 
in the early 30s shemp left over a pay dispute and moes 
brother jerome or curly joined the group which split from 
healy and shuffled off on its own to the tune of three blind 
mice 
curly later became ill and was himself replaced by shemp who 
was succeeded by two other stooges joe besser and joe derita the 
only surviving member of the comedy team 
moe was the last original stooge to die in 1975 
curly will live on this weekend in the likeness of david knight 
a palmyra ny construction worker who moonlights as an 
impersonator of the baldheaded barking buffoon who was so often 
the butt of moes jokes 
i did a nyuk nyuk and a couple of woo woos and it just 
took off from there said knight who thinks the stooges comedy 
has lived on because it transcends all generations 
the trios films were once outlawed by some mothers who thought 
the stooges were too violent 
mom couldnt accept that that wasnt a real hammer curly was 
getting hit with reighter said but kids could

more than 100 officials fired unjustly in the 
troubled region of nagornokarabakh have been reinstated but those 
urging continued strikes may face criminal or disciplinary action 
the tass news agency reported friday 
the reinstatements appeared to be the latest effort by officials 
to end crippling strikes in the region and ease an ethnic dispute 
that has raged since february 
however the nightly television news program vremya described 
the atmosphere in nagornokarabakh as tense only two buses were in 
service in the regions central city of stepanakert the television 
report said 
the region which is part of the soviet republic of azerbaijan 
has been idled by strikes and demonstrations as armenians who 
comprise more than twothirds of the areas population have 
pressed their demands for annexation with neighboring armenia 
a decision by the presidium of the supreme soviet the nominal 
parliament on monday declared annexation impossible but the 
labor unrest in nagornokarabakh has continued 
it was not clear how many stepanakert residents were on strike 
but the staterun media reports suggested little if any improvement 
in the labor situation there 
tass quoted a national prosecutor in warning government 
ministers and industrial managers who fail to take all measures at 
their disposal to end the strikes 
more than 100 people who were earlier dismissed from their 
factories for a variety of reasons determined by abnormal and 
interethnic relations have been reinstated tass reported 
however a criminal investigation of at least one enterprise 
director is under way and others face disciplinary action the news 
agency said 
the strikes have caused millions of dollars in damage to the 
azerbaijani economy and prevented deliveries of materials to 
factories in other regions 
soviet media reported food shortages throughout nagornokarabakh 
and blamed the shortages on workers refusal to handle deliveries 
to the region government statistics released thursday showed 
azerbaijan was the only soviet republic that failed to meet its 
industrial output quotas for the first half of 1988 
residents of yerevan the capital of the armenian republic had 
been staging sympathy strikes and demonstrations prior to the 
presidium decision but leaders there called off labor actions last 
week 
however thousands of armenians have been gathering nightly at 
yerevans central square to protest the rejection of the annexation 
drive 
vremya showed film from an interview with security troops in 
yerevan who described the situation there as complicated but 
improving 
a correspondent for armenpress armenias official news agency 
reported that only about 7 percent of yerevans industrial workers 
failed to show up for work on friday 
the mostly christian armenian population of nagornokarabakh has 
complained during that they suffer discrimination under the 
jurisdiction of azerbaijan which is predominantly moslem 
the leadership of the region of 160000 residents voted earlier 
in july to join armenia but that action was vetoed by the 
azerbaijani leadership 
the soviet constitution professes to give citizens the right to 
choose their government but it also gives each of the 15 
constituent republics the final say on any proposed border changes 
the presidium decision leaned on that constitutional provision 
in ruling that nagornokarabakh should remain part of azerbaijan 
which has governed the region since 1923 
armenians began a campaign to annex nagornokarabakh in 
february at least 32 people died in ethnic rioting that broke out 
later that month in the azerbaijani city of sumgait

answer to repeated questions about negotiating directly iraq 
iranian president ali khamenei said iran is ready to go 
along without any limitations whatsoever on implementation of 
resolution 598 on request if the secretarygeneral requires 
he did not answer the question directly but said the 
secretarygeneral had not requested direct talks perez de cuellar 
said earlier this week he would prefer such negotiations but did 
not respond to mahallatis statement 
the secretarygeneral invited the foreign ministers aliakbar 
velayati of iran and tariq aziz of iraq to visit un headquarters

a federal appeals court on friday let stand 
the environmental protection agencys 1984 denial of petitions from 
maine new york and pennsylvania seeking action against acid rain 
originating in smokestacks in the midwest 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia did however order that new yorks case be 
returned to the agency for new data because the standards have been 
changed since the cases were filed in 1980 and 1981 
the three states argued that sulfur dioxide emitted from 
coalburning utility plants and factories in illinois indiana 
michigan ohio tennessee west virginia and kentucky made it 
impossible for them to meet federal air quality standards and that 
the epa was required to force those midwest states to revise their 
air pollution control plans 
but the court said that the proper forum for giving the epa 
guidance on the issue is congress not the judiciary 
sulfur dioxide is transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuric 
acid which concentrates in clouds falls on its own as fine 
particles and is washed out of the atmosphere in solution with 
rain environmentalists say acid rain threatens lakes and streams 
and their aquatic life 
new york had argued that the western part of the state was 
violating standards for smoke dust and soot pennsylvania said 
sulfur dioxide from ohio and west virginia resulted in violations 
in in southwest pennsylvania of the sulfur dioxide standard maine 
argued that it could not meet federal visibility requirements at 
acadia national park because of sulfate haze originating in the 
midwest 
new york had suggested in its appeal to the court that it would 
be willing to gather new data in an effort to show that it could 
not comply with the revised epa regulations the court accepted 
that suggestion 
however in pennsylvanias case the court noted that the state 
did not have hard data on sulfur dioxide violations and that for 
one part of the state pennsylvanias computer model showed that 80 
percent of violation came from sources within the state 
the court said that maines petition was legally deficient in 
that it did not allege that its own clean air plan was threatened 
it is well established that when a court is reviewing 
predictions within an agencys area of special expertise at the 
frontiers of science the court must gernerally be at its most 
deferential to the agency wrote judge david sentelle for 
himself ruth bader bingsburg and edmund l palmieri 
in the clean air act where congress wanted epa to review the 
adequacy of existing plans it said so against that backdrop 
congress silence is significant the panel said 
because the administrators construction of the act is 
consistent with the plain language of the relevant provision and 
is a reasonable one this court must accept it the court said 
in a brief separate opinion fully concurring judge ginsburg 
wrote that congress did not supply such direction in this 
instance instead it allowed and has left unchecked the epas 
current approach to interstate air pollution the judiciary 
therefore is not the proper place in which to urge alteration of 
the agencys course 
epa spokesman chris rice said the agency was gratified that the 
court ruled the state petitions were properly denied

troops blocked moslem worshipers from reaching 
jerusalem on friday and riot police reinforcements were sent to the 
holy city in anticipation of a troubled weekend 
israeli officials said jerusalem was becoming the center of a 
7monthold palestinian rebellion in the occupied territories in 
which 231 palestinians and four israelis have died 
they said greater tension was expected this weekend because of 
coinciding arab and jewish holidays that focus on the sacred and 
disputed temple mount 
more than 100 clubwielding riot police stood guard friday in 
the walled old city where about 3500 moslems gathered for prayer 
moslem leaders said 17000 worshipers had been expected on the 
friday before the fourday moslem holiday eid aladha many were 
turned back at israeli roadblocks however and curfews kept home 
about 270000 palestinians 
dozens of orthodox jews in black coats watched from rooftops 
around the temple mount as a moslem prayer leader told his flock 
jews think only with their power and their weapons 
the last day is approaching victory will come soon 
listen you occupiers who are preventing moslems from the west bank 
and gaza from praying in the mosques he shouted through mosque 
loudspeakers 
israel seized the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
about 30 police vehicles lined up opposite the sacred western 
wall or wailing wall the last remnant of the jewish temple 
destroyed by the romans 2000 years ago sharpshooters took 
positions on surrounding roofs 
district police chief rachamim comfort told reporters an israeli 
arab couple was detained at the temple mount entrance when they 
tried to bring in a box packed with eight firebombs 
comfort said hundreds of extra police were stationed in the 
city at sundown saturday jews start to observe the tisha bav 
fast day marking the destruction of the temple and on sunday 
moslems begin celebrating eid aladha the story of abrahams 
aborted sacrifice of his son on the mount 
police did not intervene friday when about 50 palestinian youths 
raised the outlawed palestinian flag on the temple mount and held a 
brief march shouting kill the jews and jews jews get out 
of palestine 
worshipers beat up a young palestinian woman who went onto the 
temple mount with a tape recorder she said they mistook her for a 
police informer 
theres no doubt that everything that touches upon this open 
nerve ending called religion has a high explosive potential 
ephraim sneh former head of israels military administration in 
the occupied lands told israel radio 
the center of the conflict is now in jerusalem 
city manager aharon sarig said recent violence in the city 
proves that jerusalem is actually the focus of all things 
arabamericans complained on friday of being singled out for 
harassment by israeli authorities 
philip wilcox the us consul general in jerusalem diplomat 
urged them to stand up for their rights and file complaints with 
us consular officials 
he spoke to about 200 arab americans at a gathering called by 
the american arab antidiscrimination committee a washingtonbased 
lobbying group which plans to open a jerusalem chapter 
israeli officials denied the allegations 
participants at the meeting said their money was confiscated at 
the border and they were frequently subjected to demeaning searches 
palestinians are treated like criminals said hammad siyam 
49 of west new york nj waving his american passport 
siyam was born in the west bank village of mukhmas 
how come an american jew from brooklyn who has never been here 
before has the right to stay in the west bank forever and i have 
to go back after three months said ahmad baker a west bankborn 
physician now living in norfolk va 
avi pazner a spokesman for the prime minister said jews were a 
special case allowed to stay in israel under the 40yearold law 
of return 
san franciscoborn leila ahmed abu hilal 24 who married a 
palestinian from east jerusalem three years ago said she leaves 
israel once every three months when her tourist visa expires

a federal judge on friday dismissed 
charges against one of four navajo men on trial in the killing of 
two tribal police officers after a desert drinking party last 
december 
the charge against marques atene 22 was thrown out by us 
district judge j thomas greene at the request of the prosecutor 
assistant us attorney stewart walz after the prosecution rested 
its case 
atene had been charged with firstdegree murder along with his 
half brother ben atene jr 24 and two others men thomas cly 
22 and vinton bedoni 31 in the deaths officers roy lee stanley 
and andy begay 
the trial against the others was scheduled to continue saturday 
they are being tried in federal court because the deaths occurred 
on an indian reservation 
im glad to be out of this situation atene said after the 
dismissal im happy about it but he said he had no plans to 
return to the navajo reservation adding im scared right now of 
navajo police i dont trust them 
prosecutors contend stanley and begay were shot at a dec 4 
bonfire celebration bundled into the back of a police truck 
driven to a canyon doused with flammable liquid and set on fire 
the medical eximaner concluded that they were still alive when the 
fire was set the remains were found dec 5 in copper canyon 
southeast of lake powell 
marques atenes attorney walter bugden jr said walz asked for 
the dismissal because a reasonable jury could not convict his 
client 
thats terrible that the charges were brought against marques 
in the first place and the government did the right thing by 
dismissing the charges he said walz said he moved for dismissal 
because he couldnt prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt he would 
not comment further 
testimony in the trial which began monday focused largely on 
atenes codefendants and bugden said the witnesses had testified 
only that atene was at the bonfire and that he was seen picking up 
beer cans 
thats not a crime he said 
last week greene had denied defense motions to dismiss charges 
against all four defendants the defense contends that 13 witnesses 
were coerced by fbi agents and tribal investigators who threatened 
them with jail and expulsion from the reservation but greene 
rejected that argument 
before the prosecution wound up its testimony friday the 
brother of one of the slain officers said that cly threatened his 
brother a month before he died 
larry stanley testified that he was with his brother roy when 
the officer arrested cly for possession of liquor within the navajo 
reservation where possession of alcohol is illegal 
stanley quoted cly as saying to the officer your badge means 
nothing youre going to die later 
under crossexamination by clys attorney stanley said his 
brother had been threatened numerous times by other people hed 
arrested stanley also acknowledged that he had told fbi 
investigators that the threat was made in august but later amended 
the date to about nov 3

ronald reagan wanted to make americans believe in 
their country again during his eight years as president and in a 
british television documentary even his critics find it hard to 
pin anything bad on what one called the good king 
still history may take a dim view of some legacies of the 
reagan years such as billions of dollars in national debt critics 
said in the last of a threepart series on reagan and his 
presidency 
the commercial television series reagan on reagan ended 
friday on channel 4 
interviewed for the program the 77yearold president talked of 
the iran arms scandal and said he approved weapons sales to the 
iranians because he just couldnt sit by while us hostages 
were held 
commenting on what was probably the deepest crisis of his 
presidency reagan defended the weapons sales saying he had 
believed the iranians would help gain release of hostages held by 
iranianlinked islamic groups in lebanon 
you cant sit by when you know that youve got citizens of 
your country who are held in savage captivity by barbarians of that 
type he said 
reagan also told channel 4 id always believed that there was 
a kind of a hunger for a spiritual revival in our country not 
only a revival in those things of morality and family and so forth 
but in our nation as a whole and we set out to do that 
i hear from a great many people who say that they now have a 
restored belief in our country 
whether weighing highs like the superpower arms treaty or lows 
like the iran arms scandal both critics and supporters seemed 
confounded by the secret of reagans popularity as they spoke of 
him for the program 
rep tom foley dwash majority leader of the house of 
representatives said reagan will be remembered perhaps as a good 
king but a bad prime minister 
he is a generous man and he is a good man said sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny its just that some very bad things 
happened during his presidency and part of the ominous quality 
was that it was difficult to see how ominous those things were 
former treasury secretary donald regan said you dont know 
how he does it but he does it and in the last analysis when 
the game is over they dont ask you how you won the game but 
whether you won the game or not 
historian garry wills suggested the astonishing protection 
of reagan stems from his ability to make americans believe in their 
country again as he promised he would 
wills author of reagans america said the presidents 
success is a a matter of the emotional investment american people 
have made in him if he is not what we thought he is all along 
then we look like fools 
with decembers signing of a superpower arms treaty to eliminate 
mediumrange nuclear missiles reagan changed the agenda of arms 
control from limiting the rate of increase to making very big 
reductions said secretary of state george p shultz 
still critics said the nation suffered under reagan in some 
ways including in its economy 
the bottom 60 percent of the population have been getting a 
smaller share of total income and the top 20 percent of the 
population are getting an increasing share of total income said 
lester thurow dean of the massachusetts institute of technologys 
sloan school of management 
investment banker peter petersen said in speaking of the us 
debt i think history will say weve made some of the worst 
choices in the history of our country 
he argued that foreign policy will suffer because the attempt 
to stand tall while youre on bended knees will be a rather 
difficult posture to sustain

col enrique bermudez will step down 
as military commander of nicaraguan rebel forces to defuse the 
controversy caused by his appointment to the contras directorate 
a fellow leader said friday 
alfredo cesar one of the seven contra directors also said he 
is asking president oscar arias of costa rica to try to arrange a 
new round of peace talks between the usbacked rebels and 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
cesar is the chief contra negotiator in the talks 
he told a news conference the new nicaraguan resistance 
directorate will delegate areas of responsibility and in this 
sense col enrique bermudez will step down next week from the 
general command of the national liberation army 
in this manner col bermudez who now forms part of the 
directorate will only be the military supervisor of our military 
forces but without any command 
bermudez was a colonel in the national guard of the rightist 
proamerican somoza dynasty that ruled nicaragua for 42 years until 
it was overthrown by the sandinistas in july 1979 he long has been 
a source of friction within the contra coalition known as the 
nicaraguan resistance 
the controversy heated up after bermudez was elected to the 
directorate the political leadership at a meeting monday in the 
dominican republic 
seven commanders of the small contra organization called the 
southern front which fights in southern nicaragua resigned in 
protest 
cesar publicly appealed to the seven to withdraw their 
resignations saying they had been badly informed about the changes 
the resignation of these commanders and the threats by other 
groups such as the social christians and members of the central 
front to withdraw is precipitous but we must also recognize they 
feel frustrated because they do not receive american aid cesar 
said 
cesar said the southern front received no us humanitarian aid 
because the costa rican government did not approve its delivery 
through costa rica 
the southern front has a political base in costa rica the 
northern front led by bermudez is based in honduras which raised 
no objections to deliveries there 
the us congress has not approved any military aid to the 
contras since february 
cesar said the contras asked arias two months ago for permission 
to deliver humanitarian aid still in the pipeline through the costa 
rican red cross but have received no reply 
the sandinistas said bermudezs election was engineered by the 
us central intelligence agency and would make the possibility 
of negotiating peace even more remote 
the sandinistas and the rebels have been trying to negotiate an 
end to their sevenyear war since march prompted in large part by 
the regional peace plan that won arias last years nobel peace 
prize 
a temporary truce has been in effect with repeated extensions 
since march 21 no new talks were scheduled after last round ended 
in deadlock june 9

two human rights groups asked 
president corazon aquino on friday to renew peace talks with 
communist rebels and lawyers who defend people charged with 
rebellion demanded protection from reprisals 
fridays appeals were issued by the philippine alliance of human 
rights advocates and the ecumenical movement for justice and peace 
they followed a call by roman catholic bishops last week for 
resumption of talks that collapsed in january 1987 
mrs aquino did not respond to the appeals she has expressed 
willingness to talk if the rebels make a formal request the 
insurgents say the government will use negotiations to trap top 
leaders of the 19year insurgency 
her government and the rebel national democratic front 
negotiated after a 60day ceasefire that began in december 1986 
but the government refused to accept rebel demands for inclusion in 
the government and fighting resumed in february 1987 
the national democratic front is the umbrella for a dozen 
marxist organizations including the communist party of the 
philippines and its military wing the new peoples army 
about 50 civil rights lawyers marched to the presidential palace 
friday to ask mrs aquino to protect them from reprisals for 
defending clients charged as communist rebels 
the march followed a twoday conference during which lawyers 
from the united states philippines and four other countries 
discussed the slayings of at least five filipino human rights 
lawyers in the last eight months and reported harassment of many 
others 
conference participants released texts of letters from the 
american bar association to mrs aquino and us secretary of state 
george shultz expressing concern about recent killings of human 
rights lawyers here 
in the letter to mrs aquino the aba cited the june 24 murder 
of lawyer alfonso surigao jr who protested the treatment of 
leftists detained by the military and the killing july 2 of 
emmanuel mendoza another civil rights attorney 
neither case has been solved but a philippine constabulary 
colonel was relieved of his duties after being linked to the 
surigao murder 
the lawyers group met with defense secretary fidel ramos who 
assured them human rights violators will be prosecuted said norman 
dorsen of the lawyers committee for human rights in new york 
a resolution adopted at the meeting asked that the government 
investigate the killings and take steps to protect lawyers from 
harassment by security forces 
on thursday the free legal assistance group released a report 
saying more human rights lawyers have been killed or harassed 
during the first two years of mrs aquinos administration than 
during the last nine years of deposed president ferdinand marcos 
20year rule 
it said five lawyers have been killed since mrs aquino came to 
power in february 1986 and four were slain from 1977 to 1986

the environmental protection agency has agreed 
to consider regulations aimed at reducing the hazards of dioxins 
emitted from incinerators paper mills pesticide wastes and 
chemical manufacturing an environmentalist group said friday 
the agreement would settle a lawsuit brought by the group the 
environmental defense fund said ellen silbergeld toxicologist for 
the fund 
however the justice department still must approve the 
settlement before it can be submitted to the judge said alicia 
tenuta epas spokeswoman for toxic substances 
the case had been scheduled to go to trial on monday 
the 135 dioxins and dozens of related compounds are considered 
highly toxic because one of them is the most powerful cause of 
cancer ever tested in laboratory animals there is some evidence 
that dioxins can cause birth defects but in humans the most 
significant known effect is the appearance of chloracne a form of 
acne among people exposed to high concentrations 
the dioxins are formed in tiny amounts as a byproduct of almost 
all combustion and as unwanted reaction products in certain 
chemical reactions almost all humans have trace amounts in their 
fatty tissues 
it will be the first time epa has considered dioxin at the 
source all their programs have been cleanup programs ms 
silbergeld said 
the fund sued to force action under the toxic substances control 
act which allows petitions like the funds for restrictions on 
chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to health or the 
environment 
we were addressing them anyway ms tenuta said but under 
the settlement if approved there are various hammers 
deadlines that come into play for making decisions on whether 
control measures are needed and when to adopt them

sundays general election is expected 
to produce a governing coalition that will ask prime minister prem 
tinsulanonda to continue in office and pursue the conservative 
policies he has followed since 1980 
prems current coalition became riddled with factionalism and he 
called elections two years early 
a total of 3612 candidates from 16 parties are contesting 357 
seats in the house of representatives and no party is expected to 
gain a majority 
thai elections generally center on personalities not issues 
and the main question has been whether prem should continue as 
prime minister 
prem has not said if he will accept another term but analysts 
consider him the most probable choice they say the 67yearold 
former army commander who has no party affiliation is in the best 
position to forge the compromises needed for a governing alliance 
most coalition leaders favor keeping him in office and he has 
the support of three other elements involved in the decision the 
military bureaucracy and king bhumibol adulyadej 
whoever is selected as prime minister no change is expected in 
thailands prowestern conservative policies 
parties in the current coalition are the democrats thai nation 
social action and citizens

a convicted cocaine trafficker presented 
at a news conference friday said when one is with god one has 
nothing to worry about 
roberto suarez gomez considered to be one of south americas 
narcotics kingpins was arrested wednesday at his ranch near the 
city of trinidad 
reporters were allowed to see him where he is being held at the 
narcotics control office in a la paz subburb but they were not 
permitted to question him and his comments were limited 
suarez gomez 57 said he was feeling well and then information 
minister herman antelo stopped him from making further comments and 
said suarez gomez would be free to talk to the news media after he 
is transfered next week to the san pedron prison in la paz 
suarez gomez faces a 15year prison sentence after being 
convicted earlier this year of drug trafficking charges in 
trinidad 320 miles northeast of la paz he was tried in absentia 
and has not appealed the sentence according to interior minister 
juan carlos duran 
the governments top priority is combatting the cocaine trade 
which is a threat to our democratic system duran told the news 
conference 
ten antidrug policemen captured suarez gomez as he was sleeping 
at his ranch 25 miles north of trinidad the police confiscated 20 
automatic weapons and also arrested two men they said were suarez 
gomez bodyguards 
the united states seeks the extradition of suarez gomez foreign 
minister guillermo bedregal said that could not happen because the 
two countries do not have an extradition treaty dealing with drug 
trafficking and there is a prison sentence pending against suarez 
gomez here bedregal noted that negotiations are under way between 
the united states and bolivia on an expanded extradition pact 
suarez gomez was indicted in florida in 1980 on a charge of 
conspiring to transfer 854 pounds pounds of cocaine to the united 
states 
jack hook a us drug enforcement administration spokesman in 
miami claimed suarez gomez was involved in dealing in tons of 
illegal drug shipments 
hes really the same as the upper levels of the medellin 
cartel said hook he could be considered one of the pioneers 
involved in manufacturing and trafficking cocaine to the united 
states 
the medellin cartel named so because it is centered in the 
colombian city of medellin is considered the major cocaine 
trafficking organization in latin america 
police intensified the search for suarez gomez after he recently 
said in an interview on channel 4 television that the american 
government is the king of cocaine and the viceroy is the bolivian 
government 
he claimed politicians and law enforcement officials received 
bribes from drug traffickers in the ensuing political furor the 
government suspended channel 4s operating license for six months 
president victor paz estenssoro signed a law wednesday that 
makes most coca growing illegal coca leaves the raw material for 
cocaine are traditiontlly chewed by bolivian peasants and the law 
is expected to include at least 80 percent of the production 
about 350000 people in bolivians population of 62 million 
depend on coca leaf farming and cocaine production for their 
livelihood according to duran 
it is estimated that the illegal drug trade for bolivia south 
americas most impoverished country amounts to about 300 million 
per year compared to 500 million for all legal exports

rep dan mica has written a letter to 
president fidel castro expressing shock and astonishment 
over the cuban governments decision to revoke visas which he and 
several aides had been given for travel to cuba 
the florida democrat had planned to visit cuba to inspect us 
diplomatic facilities as part of his duties as chairman of a house 
foreign affairs subcommittee 
but cuba revoked the visas tuesday evening shortly before mica 
and his companions were scheduled to fly to the island citing the 
presence of cuban human rights advocates at a reception given by a 
us diplomatic official a week ago 
in his letter to castro dated thursday and released on friday 
mica said i am shocked that you should choose to interfere with 
a legitimate congressional visit to conduct internal us business 
and review the operations of our mission in your country 
a dispatch from cubas prensa latina news agency quoted a cuban 
foreign ministry statement as saying the reception was organized 
to make it possible for american diplomats to instruct their 
counterrevolutionary servants and was not a normal diplomatic 
activity 
the foreign ministry went on to say that the meeting was 
interference in the internal affairs of cuba and a gross 
provocation that steps completely away from the functions foressen 
for the us special interests section in our country for which it 
has enjoyed and enjoys all the facilities offered by our 
government 
the dispatch was monitored in mexico city 
mica said in his letter that he and his staff have visited a 
number of overseas posts including in the soviet union and never 
encountered any hindrance from the host government 
it is ironic that the congressional group you capriciously 
kept out of cuba has traveled freely to the capitals of your allies 
behind the iron curtain mica wrote 
mica added that cubas explanation for revoking the visas was 
astonishing because the action occurred just weeks before a 
scheduled visit of a delegation from the united nations human 
rights commission to cuba 
if the mere fact that members of the cuban committee on human 
rights attended a party results in punitive action against the 
united states one can hardly imagine that the cuban people would 
feel free to meet and provide information to representatives of the 
un human rights commission he said 
mica called on castro to make it clear to the people of cuba 
that they are free to speak openly to the commission members 
otherwise he said i can only interpret the events of the 
past few days as a brazen attempt to intimidate those in your 
country who might try to meet with the un group mica said 
the state department also has criticized the cuban action and 
lodged an official protest with cuban authorities on thursday

a medical physicists error allowed 153 
cancer patients to receive radiation overdoses at the royal devon 
and exeter hospital in southwest england health officials said 
friday 
of those patients who received the 25 percent extra dosages 
while undergoing radation therapy between february and july of this 
year 22 have died according to exeter health official david king 
king said however that the deaths could not be attributed 
directly to the increased radiation another doctor said it was 
unlikely but possible that the overdoses led to deaths 
king said it was a mathematical miscalculation and the 
medical physicist is mortified he said the error discovered 
eight days ago has been corrected the physicists name was not 
released 
the exeter health and safety executive has begun an inquiry into 
the mistake and another investigation will be conducted by charles 
joslin a professor at leeds university radiotherapy department 
king said 
exeter radiotherapist dr chris rowlands said in the majority 
of cases most people i think will be unaffected by this 
particular error but the patients tolerance to radiation varies 
asked by a reporter if the error could have led to deaths 
rowlands said i think it is most unlikely but in a limited 
number of cases in certain sites that has to be a possibility 
he said there was no such thing as a normal dosage because 
amounts of treatment varied greatly 
hylton meire a consultant radiologist at kings college 
hospital london said the 25 percent overdose given to treat a 
tumor was within the normal range of error 
when dealing with therapeutic doses of radiation the 
calculation is to minimize the damage to surrounding tissue while 
giving tumors a fatal dose he said and calculations could vary 
from one hospital to another by as much as 50 percent

all 92 indiana counties were declared 
drought disaster areas friday by us agriculture secretary richard 
lyng lt gov john m mutz announced 
the designation means qualified indiana farmers will be able to 
receive lowinterest farmers home administration emergency loans 
the loans can be for up to 80 percent of the farmers loss at an 
interest rate of 4 percent the loans must be paid back in five to 
seven years mutz said 
in spite of rain this week purdue university specialists 
caution that nearly 90 percent of the states corn crop remains 
rated poor or very poor were not out of the woods yet said 
agronomist cliff spies 
nevertheless agriculture experts staffing the universitys 
drought hotline say the number of calls dropped dramatically and 
the spirits of the callers seemed improved 
us rep james jontz dind a member of the house agriculture 
committee said earlier friday that fewer than 10 percent of 
indianas farmers will benefit from the disaster declaration unless 
the government waives a crop insurance requirement attached to the 
loans 
provisions to waive that rule for a year have been added to the 
house version of the measure jontz said during a statehouse news 
conference 
mutz said the disaster declaration and related loans would be 
valuable tools for some farmers however he said the real fact 
is that the thing farmers need more than this is not more loans 
but better cash flow mutz said

the attack aboard a greek cruise ship 
july 11 was in fact a clash between abu nidal terrorists and the 
israeli secret service set off by anger over an aborted hijacking 
of the vessel a newspaper said 
the attack aboard the city of poros killed nine people and 
wounded 98 
the copenhagen bt paper reported in its saturday edition that 
two groups an abu nidal terrorist group and mossad israels 
secret service opened fire on each other after mossad stopped the 
terrorists from hijacking the ship 
quoting danish intelligence officers and unidentified diplomatic 
sources bt said the abu nidal group started shooting after 
watching a television news report saying a car bomb detonated 
outside the greek port city of piraeus 
greek police said the car bomb went off prematurely six hours 
before the ship was due to dock killing two people in the car 
the newspaper report said the terrorists reportedly planned to 
bring explosives from the car aboard the cruise ship when it 
arrived in piraeus with 471 passengers to be used in a hijacking 
instead the explosives were detonated by mossad to avert the 
hijacking the bt version ran two of those killed in the attack 
on the city of poros are believed to be abu nidal terrorists the 
report said 
it said danish intelligence is working on the case because 
libyan passport holder hejab jaballa identified by the greek 
government as the likely leader of the terrorist attack arrived in 
greece on a flight from copenhagen june 1 
jaballa has previously been identified as involved in the 
assassination of an egyptian newspaper editor for which renegade 
palestinian terrorist abu nidal real name sabry albanna 
claimed responsibility

a woman priest from the us 
episcopalian church told a conference of anglican bishops friday 
that fund raising had increased during her three years as rector of 
all saints parish in indianapolis 
the rev nan arrington peete in an address related to the 
divisive issue of women priests in the anglican communion said 
contributions in her parish had increased by 40 percent over the 
past three years 
she also said her congregation of about 150 fed impoverished 
people six days a week and in the winter of 1986 lodged the 
homeless in the church because the citys 13 episcopal churches had 
no other shelter 
it was a transforming experience for the congregation ms 
peete said 
but a male opponent of female priests declined even to say 
whether or not he recognized ms peete as a minister 
the ordination of women priests and bishops is the most 
difficult issue facing the 525 bishops from 164 countries at the 
lambeth conference which is held every 10 years 
about half the audience which included the wives of 380 
bishops gave ms peete a standing ovation 
the bishop of london graham leonard a leader of the group 
opposing women priests told the conference he did not believe the 
ordination of women was a legitimate development 
it is i believe a fundamental change for which a much 
greater doctrinal consensus is required and from the greater part 
of the christian church he said 
answering questions later at a news conference leonard said 
im not prepared to say the rev nan peete is a priest but im 
not prepared to say she isnt 
ms peete said the invitation to address the gathering came from 
the archbishop of canterbury robert runcie leader of the worlds 
70 million anglicans he is presiding over the threeweek 
conference 
opponents of the ordination of women as priests say that issue 
has created problems among us episcopalians who began ordaining 
women in 1977 a statistical handbook puts the us episcopal 
church membership at 25 million a decline of about 500000 over 
the past decade 
according to statistics released by the anglican consultative 
council a liaison body of the 27 selfgoverning churches 
worldwide seven anglican churches have ordained 1269 women 
priests 958 of them by the us episcopalians and others by 
churches in canada new zealand hong kong kenya uganda and 
brazil 
the 20 other churches have refused to ordain women and 
apparently are awaiting guidance from the lambeth conference 
the us episcopalians are now preparing to consecrate the first 
woman bishop and runcie has said that could break up the anglican 
communion because opposing bishops would not feel in communion with 
her 
some opponents say that although they might accept women 
priests they cannot accept a woman bishop because bishops are 
considered to be the successors of the allmale apostles of christ

by the democratic nominees pointed insistence that a vice 
president shouldnt hesitate to tell the boss when things are awry 
i dont know what that was all about but im sure it wasnt 
complimentary bush deadpanned to reporters 
in his speech accepting the democratic presidential nomination 
in atlanta thursday night dukakis drew thunderous cheers when he 
declared were going to have a vice president who wont sit 
silently by when somebody at the national security council comes up 
with the cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah 
for hostages

will walk into the oval office and say mr president this is 
outrageous and its got to stop thats the kind of vice president 
were going to have dukakis said 
bush the certain republican nominee suggested that dukakis 
could benefit much from the advice of bentsen the senior senator 
from texas 
if hes suggesting that bentsen can change his views on gun 
control thats good that would be an effective use for lloyd 
bentsen bush said 
the vice president sought to portray dukakis as far more liberal 
on most issues than bentsen 
ask if he wanted to suggest that the democratic party was 
running against itself bush said itll be running against 
itself by the time we get through 
the vice president spoke with reporters as he campaigned at a 
lakefront italian festival here 
asked his impression of dukakis speech bush said i thought 
he gave a very good speech he did a very good job 
asked why he arrived at that assessment bush balancing a plate 
of scrambled eggs and sausage as he moved through the crowd 
quipped because he didnt say anything nasty about me 
bush as he has done in the past defended his own access to 
president reagan democrats have long accused him of being silent 
or contradictory about his role in the administrations 
controversial decisions including the aborted arms sale to iran 
i didnt take it as personal criticism said bush because 
i have a relationship with the president where i can walk in tell 
him anything i think and then he knows im not going to go out and 
talk to the press 
bush said he was willing to take a shot from democrats on 
the armsforhostages deal but said he would talk about the 
accomplishments of the administration at the same time including 
the current record peacetime economic recovery 
the vice president declined anew to disclose what advise he gave 
to president reagan on the arms deal 
later bush told a news conference in the rain on the beach at 
point pleasant nj that he supports a ban on all ocean dumping 
the sooner the better 
frankly its a national tragedy bush said standing 
alongside a display of medical wastes that had washed up on new 
jersey beaches 
new jersey gov tom kean who stood alongside the vice 
president called bush a candidate who really cares about the 
ocean kean criticized dukakis for not also advocating a ban on 
ocean dumping 
a small group of protesters stood on the beach as bush held his 
news conference holding placards and chanting where was george 
bush as he had done earlier in the day praised dukakis 
acceptance speech although he said it struck him as superficial 
he said that democrats had made an impressive show of unity even 
though he claimed it might be shortlived 
but bush said our convention will be much more postiive i 
wont be saying whats wrong with the country 
jesse jackson made him dukakis look conservative hes not 
hes a liberal bush said

miniskirt and decreed the return of kneelength or midcalf hemlines 
for a fashionable fall and winter

myriad of prim little sheaths small spencer jackets and demure 
chiffon gowns it was presented in romes grand hotel thursday 
night to a starstudded audience that included actress sophia loren 
the valentino fall hemline harks back to the classic on the 
kneelength with a few exceptions rising a discreet two inches 
above the knee or dropping to midcalf

disappears to be replaced by proper pleats even in the longer 
skirts 
while other designers showing during the italian high fashion 
week which ended in rome friday played heavily on the gilded and 
ornate valentino insisted on simplicity throughout his collection 
by day he used such classic fabrics as gray flannel and 
houndstooth for his redingote pleated coats and townandcountry 
suits with short spencer jackets enriched by a bellshaped cuff and 
long pleated skirt with high waistline marked by a thin leather 
belt 
he also ennobled the most traditional of winter wear the 
cashmere twin set by trimming the cuff in sable for those who 
cant afford the couture version this idea is easily imitated in 
the home with a lesser wool and a humbler fur 
to rejuvenate his classical elegance valentino used bold shades 
of pastel pink blue and green as well as his trademark red velvet 
shawl collars and cuffs trimmed with lace enhance the youthful 
spirit of the collection 
the cocktail hour by valentino is basic black with a new twist 
the mixture of fabrics and shades to bring the manhattan look up to 
date an empirewaisted black velvet dress for example has a 
crisscross draped black chiffon bodice while a simple sleeveless 
black velvet sheath is brightened up by a white scalloped 
apronlike overslip

which is the trademark of italian high fashion embroidery is no 
longer flatly stitched on but comes alive in threedimensional 
sequined roses or delicate dahlias formed out of satin ribbons 
favorite fabrics are chiffon and taffeta shaped into unfussy 
silhouettes where the emphasis is always on the detail such as a 
draped bodice flowered embroidery or a richly decorated 
cummerbund colors are bold shades of yellow green purple and 
pink 
valentinos newest evening shade is madonna blue perhaps in 
deference to pope john paul ii who is celebrating 1988 as a 
special year dedicated to the virgin mary 
for the grande soiree valentino the only italian designer who 
can vie with his french colleagues for ballroom fame proposes 
wideskirted gowns in gray taffeta with an overlayer of tulle 
dotted with white tufts for a threedimensional polka dot effect 
or a sumptuous brown satin gown whose wide hem trimmed in sable 
gives it an imperial russian allure 
as valentino came down the runway which was decorated with an 
imposing sculpture of the head of a roman centurion to take a 
final bow a deeply tanned miss loren expressed her approval of the 
entire collection but said she particularly craved those

an appeals court friday rejected an attempt by 
former haitian dictator jeanclaude duvalier and his family to 
block a probe into the whereabouts of 120 million the duvaliers 
allegedly stole from the state 
lord justice sir christopher staughton dismissed the duvaliers 
claim that they were being persecuted saying in that event they 
should cooperate in the international search for the missing 
millions 
this case demands international cooperation between all 
nations he said 
a french court ruled in april that it had jurisdiction in the 
case which is to be heard in grasse the french riviera town where 
duvalier and his wife michelle now live 
duvalier was ousted in a coup in february 1986 and fled with his 
family to france haitis present rulers accuse the duvaliers of 
misappropriating the funds

information on assets that may be hidden in britain and to have 
them frozen if they turn up 
judicial sources in france have said a household budget sheet 
seized by investigators shows duvalier and his wife still live 
comfortably the sources said this could undermine their claim that 
they left all their money in haiti 
entries include such items as 5600 for a dress and 83000 
spent on jewelry from july 1987 to january 1988 
duvalier his wife and his mother the widow of the notorious

journalists business people 
and antiapartheid activists met friday and many said they would 
call for international and domestic protests of a government plan 
to require registration of journalists 
the broadlyworded regulations published june 10 say anyone 
carrying out news agency business must be registered with the 
government beginning july 31 or face a 10year prison term or a 
10000 fine 
lawyers have said the definition of a news agency is so wide 
that major commercial papers that exchange stories church and 
political groups that publish newsletters and businesses that 
issue regular press statements on their operations could be 
included if the government so desired 
south africas largest news agency the south african press 
association and all major international news agencies including 
the associated press are specifically exempted from the 
regulations 
but stringers and freelancers local journalists who 
supply news to some of the worlds major newspapers and news 
agencies are required to register if they work for more than one 
employer most do 
journalists who register under the regulations could later be 
struck off the registration list by home affairs minister stoffel 
botha who would have the power to prevent such a person from 
working again in any journalistic position his decisions can be 
made without a hearing and are not subject to appeal 
botha already has the power to expel foreigners working as 
journalists in south africa 
fridays meeting at the university of the witwatersrand 
attracted 112 people there was no formal vote 
anton harber coeditor of the weekly mail which the government 
has threatened with closure said a wide spectrum of the agencies 
or groups that might be affected by a broad interpretation of the 
regulations should say publicly we will not register we dont 
believe others should register and we would give support to those 
who follow this path 
the save the press campaign a group of journalists who 
organized the gathering said they had appealed to botha for a 
meeting but it would not take place until after the registration 
becomes effective 
editors and publishers of major newspapers were also reported to 
be seeking an audience with botha and attorneys were preparing a 
court challenge for early next week 
botha issued a statement friday saying he did not intend to 
target mainstream newspapers and if need be i will effect an 
amendment to the regulations 
i merely wanted to ensure that news agencies were kept under 
control he said referring to a halfdozen small independent 
agencies 
botha has accused such agencies of endangering the public safety 
by reporting unfavorably on police activities forced removals of 
poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that are not covered 
regularly by south africas mainstream press no criminal charges 
have been laid against the small agencies or their reporters but 
some journalists have been detained 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

undermining security would be taught a lesson that will make 
others not even think of any similar action

to mecca this year the door is always open for them he 
declared

pilgrims would be restricted this year to one for every 1000 
residents of each moslem country and aziz said iran was included in 
this restriction 
irans official islamic republic news agency charged this month 
that the saudi royal family was not fit to supervise the holy 
shrines at mecca and medina where the pilgrimage is centered

a pickup truck driver pleaded innocent 
friday to 27 murder counts one for each victim of a crash with a 
church bus hours after a grand jury rejected charges that could 
have led to the death penalty 
larry mahoney 35 was silent and looked at the floor as defense 
attorney william l summers entered pleas to the 27 murder charges 
44 counts of wanton endangerment 13 of assault and one of driving 
under the influence of alcohol 
carroll circuit judge charles f satterwhite set 270000 cash 
bond the cases chief prosecutor paul richwalsky contended the 
gravity of the crime and the possiblity mahoney would drink and 
drive warranted 1 million bond 
summers said he believed bond would be made within days 
its a high bond but i believe theres enough support in the 
community and his family to raise it he said asked if mahoney 
might not be safe out on bail he said hes a grown man hes 
got a right to decide to put his foot over the threshhold in the 
jail cell 
mahoney who is being held in oldham county jail faces 20 years 
to life in prison on each murder count if convicted conviction of 
capital murder the charge the grand jury rejected could have sent 
him to the electric chair 
after investigating into the law and evidence we concluded it 
would not be appropriate to make this a deathpenalty case 
kentucky attorney general fred cowan said after the grand jury 
indicted mahoney cowan indicated that authorities did not feel the 
crime was premeditated 
this has taken a burden off him summers said of his client 
the burden of what happened that night will never be off him 
he couldnt sleep the night before wondering if he would live 
or be put to death hes had that answered 
earlier friday dr george nichols the states medical 
examiner announced that the 24 children and three adults died of 
smoke inhalation after the bus and a truck going on the wrong way 
collided may 14 on interstate 71 near carrollton the bus owned by 
radcliff first assembly of god was returning from an outing at an 
ohio amusement park 
nichols told a news conference in louisville that alcohol was 
found in the blood of four children but he attributed this to a 
natural process and not drinking 
i believe the alcohol showed up because of the postmortem 
fermentation of blood sugar nichols said 
the recommendation of capital murder charges had been made by 
carroll county commonwealth attorney john ackman jr he suffered a 
heart attack shortly after the accident so the attorney generals 
office took over the case 
richwalsky said he met with more than 40 families of the victims 
thursday night at the radcliff police department and explained to 
them the less serious charge the state would seek 
asked if any of the families were disappointed with the 
decision richwalsky said i cant say that we had a frank and 
candid discussion if anyone was disappointed or disagreed they 
didnt verbalize it to me

birmingham mayor richard arrington in an 
emotional appeal to jesse jackson supporters implored blacks and 
whites on thursday to unite behind michael dukakis in the same way 
that they joined forces to reclaim birmingham from the bastions of 
segregation 
if blacks and whites can work side by side to rebuild and 
reclaim our city as we have done we can rebuild our party and 
reclaim the white house arrington said 
the enemy is not in this hall he said 
arrington who in 1979 became the first black to be elected 
mayor of birmingham used the theme we are family in his 
address to the democratic delegates arrington had originally been 
scheduled to introduce new jersey sen bill bradley but party 
officials changed the thursday night agenda and arringtons speech 
was not an introductory one 
i am do not forget from birmingham said the mayor we 
know about strife discord hurt feelings shattered dreams dashed 
hopes 
but we also know about healing rebuilding putting 
differences behind us about yesterdays enemy being todays ally 
about understanding forgiveness unity 
arrington a jesse jackson delegate who has pushed for a 
harmonious convention urged jackson followers to put aside their 
disappointment and work to get a democrat in the white house 
we need you jesse this party this country we need your 
ideas your convictions your empathy your passion your vision 
and that great gift from god your powerful words 
we need your strong arms to lock with ours marching into 
battle not against our own but against the party of privilege 
in his prepared remarks arrington likened the role of jackson 
and his supporters in the fall campaign to bradleys performance on 
the basketball court 
as a pro player he was a winner best known for moving 
without the ball helping to position his team for the win he 
said of the man he called my taller brother 
likewise in politics he knows that you dont always have to 
have the ball to help your team win that sometimes you have to 
move without the ball or to pass to a teammate he knows that 
teamwork is what wins

cooperation between his country and america 
i think the mere fact that we are here speaking in this room

have

hammer recently we signed letters of intent in russia for a 
joint venture and hungary has been working on this project too

yellowstone said pam gardner a fire information officer for the 
bridgerteton national forest 
although the fire was nearing the parks border it was still 
far away from any major attractions several fires were burning 
within the park but firefighters would go to work on them only if

about 25 miles north of pinedale was about 75 percent contained

threatening 15 million board feet of douglas fir worth more than 
300000 
the fire mostly on rugged private land had destroyed a 
bulldozer and logging tower 
theres no precipitation in sight this really has a lot of

town of omak with smoke but it had been circled by a bulldozer 
trail said pat quill of the bureau of indian affairs a few

sen bill bradley told the democratic national 
convention on thursday the next president must be a person who is 
awake and will stay awake and that democratic nominee michael 
dukakis is committed to excellence 
a president must engender trust because a president leads by 
trust the new jersey senator told the conventions closing 
session trust is a bond earned by honest words and honest 
activities 
bradley considered by many a candidate for the national ticket 
but who declined to run paid homage to past leaders lavished 
praise on dukakis saying he is excited to lead committed to 
govern all the people and proud of the country 
dukakis is a person committed to excellence who is calm under 
pressure and has the capacity to know whats important bradley 
said 
bradley aimed some barbs at the reagan administration without 
naming it saying the next president must be a person who is 
awake and will stay awake because he cant rest while kids kill 
kids in our cities and families sleep on the streets 
a good president doesnt define honesty as simply staying out 
of jail he said 
does it make a difference whos president of the united 
states bradley asked did lincoln make a difference did 
woodrow wilson ask any child who stares in wonder at the grand 
canyon if teddy roosevelt made a difference 
he said a president can offer inspirational leadership by 
showing how the past is part of the present and how both can lead 
to a better future 
he can give reassurance and understanding to those who have 
never been reassured or understood he can give guidance in a world 
that technology changes every day the words of a president like 
natures returning seasons can provide continuity in the midst of 
change 
courage honor and truth are vital qualities of leadership and 
the president must demonstrate selfsacrifice to encourage 
unselfishness among others bradley said 
he knows that the ultimate question posed to a citizen in 
a democracy is to ask yourself what you owe another human being 
said bradley do you owe more than a contribution to charity or 
taxes to the government do you owe a commitment of some part of 
your life or do you believe you owe nothing at all 
how we answer these questions will determine the kind of 
society we become he said 
asked before the speech if he were anxious bradley a former 
professional basketball player responded that being nervous has 
a tendency to get the adrenalin going

the wall of a concrete water tank 
ruptured friday killing four people and injuring 19 others when a 
torrent gushed through a neighborhood of adobe houses destroying 
nine homes 
residents said they had recently warned city officials about 
cracks in the 3yearold tank which was perched on a hillside 
more than 750000 gallons of water poured down the hillside 
officials said and the tanks east wall about 120 feet long 
separated cleanly from the rest of the tank 
a 90foot section of the 9inchthick reinforced concrete wall 
was thrown 20 feet across a dirt road and came to rest against a 
house the rest of the wall broke away and blocked the road 
manuel ortega director of the city water and sanitation 
department said the tank was built in 1985 though neighborhood 
residents said the tank was six months old ortega said crews 
worked on the tank about six months ago 
the tank was about 120 feet wide 60 feet deep and 12 feet high 
ortega said it was at full capacity or 780000 gallons 
we heard a very loud sound like an explosion said vicenta 
saucedo 33 but i didnt pay attention because i was feeding my 
children breakfast and then the girls went out to see what 
happened and i went out too and i saw a torrent of water flowing 
past 
the gray tank was perched near the top of a foothill to the 
western mountains bounding this border city near el paso texas 
below the tank was a cluster of houses made of adobe cinderblock 
and concrete the rush of water flattened houses in its path and 
then drained into a gully about 100 yards downhill from the tank 
the displaced families spent the day digging through mud and 
rubble to retrieve their belongings some placed clothes on 
automobiles to dry in the desert sun others cleared spots where 
they placed dishes religious statuettes and paintings alarm 
clocks and other items 
perfecto guerrero de la cruz said he was at work when he was 
notified of the accident he rushed home and found that his nephew 
francisco olvera guerrero 17 had died 
jorge martinez 3 and jose antonio martinez lin 9 also were 
killed and a man injured in the accident died friday afternoon in 
a hospital fire chief gabriel rodriguez said he said the mans 
name was not being released pending notification of relatives 
one person was in critical condition at juarez general hospital 
a police spokeswoman said twelve others were hospitalized with 
minor injuries and six people were treated and released 
during a break from digging through his houses rubble with a 
pick ax perfecto guerrero said he and neighbors had notified city 
officials a few weeks ago about cracks they had seen in the tanks 
walls 
we called them city officials before to tell them there was 
some cracks but as always they never listen until they see the 
damage he said 
the structure was filled earlier this year giving residents of 
the lopez mateos and diaz ordaz subdivision running water for the 
first time 
so we finally got water but then we got too much and lost a 
life guerrero said as he gazed at the destruction around him 
nineyearold martin torrez de la rosa said he was grinding corn 
at the bottom of the hill when he heard the sound and looked up 
when i was running away i saw a boy over there he said 
pointing to a spot farther downhill the water took him away 
city engineer luis soria told the el paso heraldpost that 
investigators were looking into the possibility that the tanks 
foundation might have been weakened in the wet ground three inches 
of rain have fallen since july 1 as measured at el paso 
international airport compared with 16 inches in a normal july 
the areas rainiest month on average 
juarez a city of 11 million with an annual growth rate of 
almost 10 percent uses different types of water tanks from ones 
like the concrete box that ruptured friday to the steel 
cylindrical tanks on stilts that are common in the united states 
witnesses said the ruptured tank was erected in just a few days 
about six months ago 
irene vallez who lives near the scene of the accident said 
water overflowed last week from pipes atop the covered tank like 
guerrero she said cracks had formed in the walls a few weeks ago 
about 905 water started coming out and flowing in a trickle 
down the street she said then about 15 minutes later i 
heard a sound like an explosion

the air force has acknowledged that its 
initial report on a 1986 radioactive spill at an ohio military base 
was incomplete but is protesting a proposed fine as unwarranted 
according to documents released thursday 
the documents made public by the nuclear regulatory commission 
were prepared by the air force in response to a proposed fine of 
102500 by the nrc in connection with the incident at 
wrightpatterson air force base near dayton 
the nrc said the proposed fine is for willful failure to report 
the spill within 24 hours and for the internal exposure of an 
individual to the radioactive powder 
however in its response to the nrc the air force argued that 
under the facts of the incident the requirements do not clearly 
mandate a report within 24 hours 
through a chain of errors but without any intent to withold 
information or deceive the subsequent report from the air force 
was neither full nor complete gary vest deputy assistant 
secretary of the air force told the nrc in addition the 
reporting regulation itself is ambiguous 
the air force said that miscommunication within the staff of 
the air forces radioisotope committee in relaying information from 
wrightpatterson resulted in the nrc not being initially provided 
with full information on the spill 
no one was injured in the spill of americium241 but a 
radiological safety officer at the base said tests showed he 
inhaled a small quantity of the powder 
the nrc said the spill occurred on sept 18 1986 and was not 
reported to the nrc until sept 26 at which time it was described 
as leakage from lowlevel radioactive waste drums and not as a 
significant spill of americium 
the air force did not formally notify the nrc of the americium 
spill until nov 7 1986 the nrc said 
prosecutors in ohio have been investigating an alleged attempt 
to cover up the spill and a former radiation safety officer at the 
base was indicted by a grand jury last may for his role in the 
incident

animal torture and slayings attributed to 
devil worshipers and the afrocuban santeria religion appear to be 
increasing and authorities are researching the tricky legal 
question of how to stop it 
the city board of animal regulation which has relied largely on 
anecdotal accounts of increased ceremonial mutilation of animals 
has asked for a report on the matter outgoing board member arthur 
margolis said thursday 
all i am aware of as an activist is that there have been 
animal sacrifices by satanist groups and other groups said 
margolis he said the study should supply documentation of the 
problem 
in suburban hawthorne authorities raided a home last week and 
seized 22 chickens two goats a piglet and a lamb the officers 
also found four goatskins several chicken carcasses and evidence 
of backyard animal slaughter the owner denied santeria practices 
reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept 
in the bathroom of a culver city home along with several chickens 
candles and other religious items suggested santeria and the 
owners were charged with animal cruelty 
margolis an attorney hopes the report will lead to 
consideration of a law banning animal deaths and tortures as part 
of a religious ceremony he admitted a first amendment fight would 
immediately follow as it already has in one city 
officials in hialeah fla a mostly hispanic city near miami 
passed three laws in 1987 aimed at the santeria church of lukumi 
babalu aye the first public church of the sect opened in florida 
los angeles has no such established church 
the hialeah laws prohibit sacrifice of animals including goats 
pigs cows poultry cats or dogs animals which sect members 
slaughter during so called red magic rituals that seek favors 
or advice from their gods 
the church sued the city in federal court alleging the laws 
violated their constitutional guarantees of freedom of religion 
the suit is pending 
charlene drennon west coast director of the humane society of 
the united states said she believes a model law drawn up by her 
group would meet constitutional tests 
there have been several cases where the supreme court has 
decided how far religious freedom can go she said thursday in an 
interview from her sacramento office she cited a supreme court 
ruling that said smoking marijuana could not be regarded as a 
religious practice 
ms drennon said however that education was a better approach 
than law enforcement when dealing with a clash between religious 
practices and animal welfare 
i think it needs a very heavy duty emphasis on educating 
people she said 
santeria is a mix of roman catholicism voodoo and african 
rituals attributed to the yoruba tribe of nigeria some roman 
catholic saints borrowed by santeria have come to represent african 
gods 
the followers are secretive about their practice and in most 
places do not have special places of worship efforts were 
unsuccessful to contact santeria followers or priests called 
santeros in los angeles or hialeah 
the establishment of the religion in los angeles is largely 
manifested by the profusion of botanicas stores which sell 
supplies statues and pictures used in santeria and other rituals 
sociologists believe there may be as many as 50000 practioners 
of santeria in the los angeles cuban immigrant community 
anthropologists estimate that related similarly derived 
religions have 100 million followers in latin america and the 
united states 
reed said authorities last fall found six goats bound and kept 
in the bathroom of a culver city home along with several chickens 
candles and other religious items suggested santeria and the 
owners were charged with animal cruelty

graceland lives 
elvis presleys only child has cleared the way for her fathers 
former residence graceland to remain a tourist attraction at 
least 10 more years lawyers said thursday 
shes not going to close it down its doing fabulously 
said blanchard tual a lawyer who was appointed to protect lisa 
marie presleys legal interests when she was a minor 
miss presley 20 would have taken sole control of his estate 
when she turned 25 according to her fathers will but she agreed 
to extend by five years the management structure of a trust set up 
to handle her fathers estate 
the management agreement approved wednesday in chancery court 
in memphis extends the conditions of the trust until 1998 said 
barry ward a lawyer for the presley estate 
basically this is a vote of confidence from lisa marie to the 
management team to continue to handle the assets that she will 
inherit from her father ward said 
tual said graceland managers have encountered problems because 
of speculation over miss presleys plans for graceland 
they found it harder and harder to deal with people on a 
longterm basis when they said look youve only got five years 
left and how do we know what lisa marie will do in five years when 
the trust terminates in order to do away with that uncertainty 
they just extended it five more years tual said 
tual no longer represents miss presley but was called in to 
review the request for the management agreement 
presley was largely uninterested in business matters during his 
career and he was worth 5 million to 7 million when he died 
estate officials say 
joseph hanks an accountant and trustee of the presley estate 
said it is worth about 50 million now and its value is increasing 
the estate which has worked in recent years to secure legal 
rights to the singers name and image includes graceland a 
whitecolumned threestory house that attracted more than 600000 
visitors last year 
the graceland complex with a 36000squarefoot shopping center 
devoted almost entirely to elvis souvenirs generates some 9 
million a year in tourist business

a legislator said thursday that a 
government representative will join national peace talks next week 
with leftist rebels but leaders did not say whether there would be 
facetoface meetings 
the announcement by federal senator edmund lopez a member of 
president virgilio barcos liberal party came a day after leftist 
guerrillas released a former presidential candidate who was 
kidnapped may 29 
after his release newspaper editor alvaro gomez hurtado on 
thursday called for the government to hold peace talks with the 
leftist rebels a controversial view in this country ripped by 
periodic guerrilla attacks and one he previously did not seem to 
share 
the april 19 movement also known as m19 freed gomez hurtado 
wednesday night m19 is the most notorious of colombias five 
leftist guerrilla groups 
gomez hurtado the conservative party candidate who lost the 
1986 presidential election was kidnapped in a hail of submachine 
gun fire in bogota 
in his presidential campaign and in editorials in el siglo 
gomez had said that he was opposed to peace talks with guerrillas 
and that the army should wipe them out 
at his news conference thursday the 69yearold journalist also 
said the colombian military should be given full support until the 
government can negotiate with the rebels 
after his release he indicated in a telephone interview with 
the associated press on wednesday night that he was not ruling out 
a peaceful solution to 30 years of civil strife that has taken more 
than 20000 lives 
the episode of my kidnapping has confirmed that we are living 
in difficult times and that it is necessary to seek national 
reconciliation he said 
the upcoming peace talks scheduled for july 29 in bogota 
sprang from negotiations in panama toward gomez hurtados release 
m19 guerrilla leaders met there with roman catholic church 
intermediaries and members of gomez hurtados party 
the government refused to send a representative there and 
rejected an m19 demand that the colombian government promise to 
reopen peace talks with them before gomez hurtados release 
the m19 freed him anyway 
the army has said repeatedly it opposes talks with the rebels 
but military leaders say they will abide by the governments 
decision 
former president julio cesar turbay also of barcos liberal 
party indicated thursday that the government is undecided 
it is very difficult for me to say what should be done 
turbay told the bogota radio station caracol 
during his 19781982 presidency turbay ordered the military to 
destroy the guerrillas 
the military and many businessmen church leaders and 
congressmen have said that 1982 peace negotiations started by then

difficult

known as contras mounted several attacks this week to disrupt the 
sandinista governments celebration of its ninth anniversary the

newspaper barricada said it makes the possibility of negotiating 
peace even more remote referring to the election of enrique 
bermudez to the sevenmember contra directorate 
the paper said bermudezs election at a meeting in the dominican 
republic on monday removes the civilian mask the contras wore 
bermudez commander of the main rebel army known as the 
nicaraguan democratic force was a colonel in the national guard of 
the somoza dynasty that ruled nicaragua for 42 years until it was 
overthrown by the leftist sandinistas in july 1979 
he has long been a major point of friction in the nicaraguan 
resistance coalition 
some members of the coalition are former sandinistas leery of a 
return to a militarydominated government at least five southern 
front field commanders split away from the resistance to protest 
bermudezs election 
claiming bermudezs election was engineered by the cia the 
barricada editorial claimed that with the appointment of the new 
directorate the cia has ratified the somoza leadership in the 
movement which years ago it made an effort to hide 
in order to ensure the survival of the contras the cia has 
been obliged to promote bermudez to the highest level of 
leadership the newspaper said 
a ceasefire has been in effect since march 21 in the 7yearold 
war between the sandinista government and the contras 
on tuesday the ninth anniversary of the sandinista guerrillas

caldera said the attacks occurred in his command which includes 
central chontales province and northern boaco province he gave no 
details except to say 34 rebels died in fighting

weapons in four airdrops in northeastern nueva guinea province 
during the first 15 days of july

firefighters gained the upper hand thursday on wildfires that 
charred some 12500 acres in california and more than 17000 acres 
in the teton wilderness of wyoming but officials remained cautious 
meantime more than 100 firefighters rushed to the umatilla 
national forest in oregon where a fire that destroyed logging 
equipment burned out of control and fires that posed no immediate 
threat to property or people burned in utah 
at least six states had fires raging but blazes in colorado and 
alaska were being brought under control or burning out 
california firefighters carved control lines around twin 
wildfires leaving flames to gnaw mostly at uninhabited timber 
country in rugged calaveras county 
the blazes that began tuesday have razed six houses including a 
600000 twostory structure with contents the owners valued at 
more than 400000 
there will never be a house like this again you spend 49 
years collecting things you love and in less than an hour theyre 
gone hazel burt said as she picked through the ruins 
authorities estimated the total timber and property losses plus 
the costs of fighting the calaveras blazes at 43 million 
although they said the figure would likely increase 
investigators found an incendiary device that was used to set 
one of the two arsonsuspected fires 
authorities predicted full containment by friday evening 
firefighters are getting the upper hand said dick craig a 
california department of forestry spokesman at the fire camp in 
rail road flat 150 miles east of san francisco and a few miles 
west of the fires 
still the pronouncement was cautious some of the lines 
arent very secure craig said 
in wyoming crews combatted a wildfire in the bridgerteton 
national forest and gained the advantage by fighting fire with fire 
forest officials began talking in guarded terms of containment 
following an intentional back burn of some 2000 acres of 
tinderdry trees on the southern edge of the fire in the teton 
wilderness 
if we can hold on to what he have secured on the south end the 
rest of today and tomorrow we have turned the corner we are 
making good progress said fire official dale jarrell 
firefighters ignited the area on the edge of the densest area 
of 15000 acres of trees blown down last summer by a rare 
highaltitude tornado by dropping chemicalfilled pingpong balls 
from a helicopter 
the controlled burn which was intended to keep the flames from 
spreading into that dense area of trees has allowed crews to get 
that part of the fire 50 percent contained said fire information 
officer ed waldapfel 
were a long ways from being out of the woods but were going 
in the right direction he said 
in oregon kathy campbell a spokeswoman for the umatilla 
national forest said about 130 federal firefighters including 
five 20person fire crews and a 30member supervisory team were 
assigned to the fire that destroyed logging equipment shortly after 
breaking out thursday afternoon 
oregon department of forestry spokesman doug decker said the 
fire quickly grew to 150 acres and stiff winds and steep canyons 
were causing concern for the firefighters 
in colorado all but two of the fires that have charred more 
than 21000 acres since saturday have been declared under control 
and in alaska where fires have burned 1300 square miles 
larger than rhode island this season the state fire service has 
left most blazes to burn themselves out it has been monitoring 
about 50 wildfires some of them weeks old 
the biggest is a 225000acre blaze 60 miles north of fairbanks 
that approached the alaska pipeline earlier this month but was 
stopped about 12 miles from it the pipeline is covered with 
heavygauge metal and was not threatened alyeska pipeline service

dorcas hardy head of the us social security 
administration said friday his organization will train chinese 
managers for chinas fledging efforts to set up retirement programs 
for its aging work force 
ms hardy who arrived in beijing monday at the invitation of 
the ministry of labor said 50 chinese will be invited to the 
united states next year to study how the 53yearold american 
social security system works 
we are in a position to provide a helping hand in chinas 
progress in setting up programs for retirees she said 
she said that since her arrival she had met officials from the 
civil affairs and labor ministries and the china fund for the 
handicapped 
communist china has never developed a national pension program 
staterun factories are responsible for paying retirees up to 75 
percent of their basic salaries causing heavy financial burdens as 
the number of retired workers increases and economic reforms put 
more pressure on enterprises to turn in a profit 
farmers accounting for more than threefourths of chinas 
population of 1 billion and the growing number of private 
entrepreneurs often have no guaranteed source of income after 
retirement 
china is also facing a rapid aging of its population the 
percentage of those aged more than 60 will increase from 84 
percent at present to 20 percent in the year 2025 
ms hardy said it was an undertaking of monumental proportions 
when the most populous nation on earth begins to construct its own 
social security program 
ms hardy said she advised china to maintain its strong emphasis 
on the family system and to reconsider its mandatory retirement 
age men in staterun enterprises now must retire at age 60 most 
women must leave work at age 55 
she said she also discussed us approaches to burdensharing 
among the government the company and the employee china recently 
began experimenting with programs where the employee contributes a 
small amount from his paycheck every month for retirement benefits 
most workers in china still pay no direct social security tax 
ms hardy said most retirement payments in china are made 
directly by the factory to its former employee she saw little 
evidence of computerization of records or the use of actuaries to 
project future demographic trends china must get a better 
system she said

monsters can be made out of the most ordinary of 
men according to playwright jon robin baitz 
it depends on how they adapt or accommodate themselves to the 
world around them and when the world is as stratified rigid 
unfeeling and corrupt as the white south africa portrayed in the 
film society they can develop into some pretty hardhearted 
creatures 
the film society which opened thursday at offbroadways 
second stage examines one such sad and frightening tranformation 
the play is a promising new york stage debut for the 26yearold 
author an american who lived in south africa for six years 
baitz has come up with a provocative look at the depressing 
metamorphosis of jonathon balton a nebbish of a man who became a 
schoolteacher because its such a quiet occupation and because 
he couldnt get a job as a radio actor 
jonathon teaches at blenheim an uppercrust boys school that 
has fallen on hard times the prep school serves as a microcosm for 
white south african society 
there are the members of the old guard ruled by the headmaster 
a pragmatic man who is more concerned about the survival of the 
school than the students he is assisted by a fiery rightwing 
instructor who is dying of spinal cancer and who rails against 
communism enveloping the country they form the bulwark against the 
younger teachers who presumably would be more enlightened about the 
school and south african society 
jonathon will have none of it instead of teaching he would 
rather preside over the schools film society where he can screen 
old doris day movies and block out his job and the real world 
the time is the early 1970s the years when baitz also lived in 
south africa the teachers and the students are aware of the racial 
tumult outside the school but none of the strife is present at 
blenheim a colonial institution that has outlived its usefulness 
at first it seems as if terry a temperamental firebrand of a 
teacher will be the plays central character its terry who sets 
the play in motion bringing in a black activist priest to speak at 
the schools centenary celebration the clergyman is arrested and 
later dies in jail supposedly of a heart attack no one except 
terry and his wife nan who also teaches at blenheim seems very 
concerned 
jonathons importance to the play is revealed gradually his 
mother a member of the old aristocracy uses her influence and 
money to get him a better job at the school at first he is 
willing to bring his friends along on his good fortune but 
practicality and ambition take over 
baitz is a strong forceful writer hes terrific at conjuring 
up pictures of south african life there are two such set pieces 
one a long description by nan of a particularly recalcitrant 
servant who worked for her parents and the other a poignant 
remembrance by jonathon of his botched attempt to kill a cow in the 
presence of his fathers african workers 
the play begins slowly and director john tillinger doesnt rush 
the actors or the action each character is allowed to reveal 
motivations gradually 
nathan lane who plays jonathon has always excelled in comic 
roles parts that demand a maximum of mugging he has risen to a 
different challenge here capturing the mans ordinary qualities 
particularly when he tries to articulate his forlorn and pathetic 
dreams about a show business career 
william glover and dillon evans are the very models of outdated 
and unfeeling british propriety while there is icy perfection from 
margaret hilton as jonathons practical mother daniel gerroll 
exudes the righteous anger of baitzs onenote radical teacher 
while laila robins brings an honesty to nan the plays one 
sympathetic character 
the film society is an impressive intelligent effort by 
baitz a playwright whose next work will be watched even more 
closely

not certain if the mammal a female about 8 feet long died from 
the same malady that killed bottlenose dolphins last summer

no one would accuse ray combs the new host of 
cbs family feud of lack of confidence 
family feud he says is the best vehicle to let me 
display what i can do most naturally therell be some skeptics 
until they see it but theyre going to have to love me theyre 
not going to be able not to 
i realized this was my vehicle he said just as carson 
had who do you trust just as merv griffin had another show just 
as groucho had you bet your life 
combs might be following in the footsteps of carson and griffin 
and marx but more immediately the steps belong to richard dawson 
who incidentally is revising who do you trust for nbc 
it was dawson who turned the silly game show of family feud 
into a personal stage for his wry humor the show has been off the 
air three years but cbs brought it back earlier this month as part 
of its daytime lineup 
i dont hesitate to follow richard at all combs said im 
excited that im following him as opposed to anyone else 
following him people say those are big shoes to fill i dont 
have to wear his shoes ive got my own 
combs grew up in ohio did mormon missionary work in arizona 
then moved to indiana he said he always knew he would become a 
successful standup comedian a belief not shared by his wife his 
childhood sweetheart 
his greatest dream was to be on the tonight show with his 
idol johnny carson 
thats why i went to california combs said in between 
tweaking a french waiter at the manhattan restaurant where he was 
having lunch 
i would go to bed and i would dream i was on johnny carson 
my wife wanted no part of it she thought i was crazy just crazy 
he moved to california without his wife though she eventually 
joined him she still wasnt convinced that he could make a living 
as a comedian though 
she knew there were more astronauts than comedians combs 
said she tried to get me to go to houston honey there are 
300 astronauts if you want a stupid dream 
combs gave up his job at levitz furniture and started playing 
the clubs full time 
then he started getting jobs warming up the studio audiences for 
sitcoms such as golden girls and facts of life the 
experience of playing amidst tv equipment in front of an audience 
that doesnt expect or want to see a comedian honed his instincts 
carson whose company produces amen came to a taping and 
caught combs act 
the dream came true and combs appeared on the tonight show 
it was the thousandth time i would be in front of a studio 
audience where for most comedians it was their first he said 
they get scared i felt like mike tyson i said i cant wait 
open those curtains ive been waiting my whole life for this 
the curtains opened and i walked out you couldnt see the 
people because the lights were so bright id never had that so i 
come out the first joke kind of shocked me but i heard them laugh 
and i trusted that they were there and as i did my routine i 
became relaxed and i started to even do things this is what made 
me different i did things i had never done before i started 
making things up that i had never done my first time 
you have six minutes at the end of that six minutes every 
comic knows the signs if johnnys smiling really big or talking to 
the guy beside him and gives you one of these an ok sign that 
means youre coming back and everybody knows johnny has the best 
feel for who the best young comics are 
combs said his time flew and he was shocked when the stage 
manager made the gesture telling him to wrap it up 
i didnt end on a joke the only thing i could think to do was 
be honest i looked at the crowd and said folks all my life ive 
had a dream that i would be on this show and tonight youve made 
my dream become a reality and i thank you very much 
when it was over they started clapping and i just saw 
twinkling i didnt know what it was it was the crowd standing up 
it was a standing ovation it was the first time in the 25year 
history of the tonight show that any comic got a standing 
ovation and when i looked over at johnny he was going come over 
here

producer george schlatter says his new nbc 
summer show funny people may not be the son of real people 
but is certainly its grandchild 
i think it has its roots in real people as does a lot of 
television today said schlatter we did a lot of funny stories 
in real people but this is all about people who are funny some 
are funny on purpose some who are not intentionally funny and some 
of the people are behind funny people 
when we started real people in 1979 the country was at a 
low point in selfesteem and pride we came on opened the show 
with the flag talked about the little guy and celebrated heroes i 
think it affected the countrys selfesteem today we desperately 
need to laugh 
schlatters name has been associated with laughter for many 
years he produced the innovative laughin series in the 1960s 
he also initiated and produces the annual comedy awards 
george schlatters funny people makes its debut wednesday 
for a onehour look at funny people places and events the hosts 
are comedians blake clark rita rudner scott blakeman and reporter 
leeza gibbons of entertainment tonight 
the show like schlatters real people which ran on nbc 
from 1979 to 1984 begins with the hosts on stage they will 
introduce segments taped all over this country along with special 
features from abroad 
were doing a lot of pieces on people who make us laugh 
said schlatter some are comedians filmmakers eccentrics were 
taping a lot of them on location we have people in japan england 
canada and australia making tapes we sent blake clark to interview 
people at the democratic convention in atlanta it was tough 
getting credentials but it helps to know people in low places 
were going to have somebody at the republican convention 
we also have an army of kids out there doing videos for us we 
went to the schools and video departments to recruit them well 
use the best and give each student whose tape is selected a sony 
8mm camcorder 
all of the comedianhosts had appeared on the syndicated show 
george schlatters comedy club

so many are coming in that his editing house is operating 24 hours 
a day he is now installing computerized editing equipment 
the trouble with television today is that its getting so 
careful and so repetitive he said car crashes drugs and 
women in jeopardy the sitcoms are all the same they solve every 
problem in 30 minutes i cant even understand the problem in 30 
minutes the only thing different on tv today is tracey ullman and

with los angeles gangs spreading their 
drugdealing to kansas city a citizens anticrime group is 
fighting to keep the citys youth from falling prey to the lure of 
flash and money 
members of two gangs the bloods who identify themselves by 
wearing red clothing or red bandannas and the crips who wear blue 
have been infiltrating kansas city for months 
on may 13 a member of the crips was arrested after he arrived 
in kansas city by train from los angeles allegedly carrying more 
than 20 pounds of cocaine worth 12 million 
police in dozens of cities are alarmed that the los angeles 
gangs are exporting their drug trade earlier this month 50 law 
enforcement officers from 11 cities in the midwest and the west 
attended a twoday conference in kansas city to develop a national 
strategy to fight the gangs 
but long before members of the 11yearold ad hoc group against 
crime began drawing their own battle lines in the antigang 
antidrug war 
ad hoc has had success in helping police solve murders rapes 
and robberies now the group is also focusing on keeping the young 
from becoming casualties of drugs 
ad hoc a grassroots organization whose 240 members are mostly 
black was created in 1977 to ease tensions between blacks and 
police it has since grown into a citizens anticrime group 
meeting monthly and anyone is eligible to join 
drugs have been a problem for years but ad hoc founder alvin 
brooks says that now some streets have been taken over by 
pushers 
in one housing development he cited small groups of young drug 
dealers many wearing blue and red lounge in the shade of trees 
parked nearby are shiny new luxury sedans seemingly incongruous 
among the rows of drab threestory brick buildings 
a police officer patrolling the area said some of the young men 
wearing blue or red were crips and bloods 
to a youngster raised in a poor neighborhood a drug dealer 
driving a luxury car with a pocket full of cash can be someone to 
admire a teenager working as a lookout decoy or courier for a 
dealer can earn more in a day than he could in a week in a 
minimumwage job 
ad hoc has approached the dealers headon for more than two 
years it has conducted harassment campaigns against suspected drug 
houses in some cases rolling caskets past carrying signs and 
warning with bullhorns that pushers should leave 
we did not feel at any time that we were encroaching on the 
rights of drug dealers brooks said but felt they were 
encroaching on the rights of the community by their drugdealing 
hoping to show the unglamorous side of drugs ad hoc is 
organizing trips to penitentiaries and to courts for drug trials 
earlier this month 24 youths joined in the first prison visit 
brooks hopes 400 will do so by summers end 
this is not so much to scare the kids but to let them see and 
hear what their idolized statussymbol role models are doing to the 
community and to see the end results of drug dealing said 
brooks who is kansas citys director of human relations 
ad hoc which is supported by private donations plans to begin 
instructing parents how to recognize signs that their children are 
becoming involved with gangs or drugs 
the group recently opened a youth drug abuse hotline and 
although it hasnt been publicized volunteer workers answering the 
telephones have been overwhelmed with calls brooks said 
the phone line exists so callers can report suspected drug 
users ask questions about drugs and discuss their own problems 
in late june ad hoc counselors some of whom are reformed drug 
users began visiting the homes of children identified as just 
getting involved in drugs to try to get the parents and children 
together to discuss the problem brooks said 
brooks said some parents may consider the counselors intrusive 
but that the effort had to be made 
we can not wait around until drugs strike a person and he or 
she is destroyed he said we have to at least broach the 
subject 
ad hoc workers try to help teenagers find jobs and expose them 
to organizations such as the boys club 
the presence of gangs raises the stakes and brooks said 
killings could increase unless action is taken 
were aware of the amount of drugs and guns out there in the 
streets of kansas city and a spark can ignite it all he said 
capt sylvester winston who heads the police departments 
homicide unit has a particular interest in seeing ad hocs efforts 
work 
winston who has been a member of ad hoc almost since its 
inception says at least 50 percent of the homicides in the city 
are directly related to drugs 
about 80 percent of all homicides in the city have been solved 
in the past year due in part to ad hocs help winston said 
ad hoc he said has a close relationship with the police and 
great respect in the community 
asked if he feared it might turn into a vigilante group winston 
said members realize they must obey the laws but added it 
could if dope dealers keep killing our kids

the headline on the story last week might have 
gone something like this peace breaks out in gulf well be 
paying more for gas 
no non sequitur there it was just a typical day in the oil 
futures market where headlines of good news or bad can move 
prices faster and further than any fundamental law of economics 
on july 18 world oil markets got wind of a possible ceasefire 
agreement in the nearly 8yearold war between persian gulf 
protagonists iran and iraq prices for future delivery of crude oil 
shot up nearly 1 a barrel to near 16 
the runup was bullish news for oil traders who had languished 
through the summer watching prices sink far below the official opec 
price of 18 
but wait a second shouldnt peace in the wartorn gulf be 
bearish news for prices after all you figure prices should drop 
in an already glutted market if they stop mining the waters and 
shooting at ships right 
wrong peace was viewed that particular monday as a sign the 
fractious organization of petroleum exporting countries might seize 
the opportunity to cut production and bolster prices 
there has been a lot of cheating going on in the cartel 
particularly by the wars combatants who have been pumping oil to 
finance their fight if they suddenly decide to lay down their 
arms it is also possible the cartel members could get together on 
production and pricing 
instant analysis aside is peace really bullish or bearish for 
prices 
you could argue that one until the cows come home answered 
one trader eager to move on to more definitive issues last week 
traders never seem much in the mood for longwinded debates why 
let fundamentals like supply and demand confuse the picture the 
real action comes off the headline no matter what it says 
just last year prices were also on the rise in midjuly but 
the news in the gulf was very different tensions were high and 
iran was threatening to sink any oil tankers moving through the 
region under the protective flag of the united states 
in response to that news prices surged above 22 a barrel for 
the first time in 18 months on the theory that heightened 
hostilities would lead to at least a temporary cutoff of oil 
shipments 
a quick review of a reporters notes on the warprice 
relationship over the last 12 months would therefore produce the 
following rocksolid formulas 
1 in the summer of 1987 war equaled higher prices 
2 in the summer of 1988 peace equals higher prices 
applying such axioms to the oil market will not earn high marks 
when supplies are plentiful and traders look to the news to create 
some precious volatility 
of course the apparent contradiction makes perfect sense to the 
oil traders themselves war in 1987 threatened involuntary 
restraints on oil supplies peace a year later holds the promise of 
voluntary limits imposed by a rejuvenated opec 
elementary perhaps for a commodity trader but dangerous for 
the rest of us who only want to know if the price of gasoline is 
going up before we fill up for the summer trip to grandmas 
the advice from one expert bob baker of prudentialbache 
securities inc is to watch the paper for more than a day or two 
before jumping to conclusions 
over a longer period of time the relationship between market 
movements and gas prices is almost onetoone said baker but 
in the near term theres too much static in there to tie the two 
together

maybe just maybe nations are turning to 
diplomacy to end wars that have littered the world with millions of 
corpses turned even more millions into refugees and filled 
hospitals with maimed and crippled men women and children here is 
a report on recent worldwide steps toward the rule of reason rather 
than force

when ayatollah khomeinis iran 
dramatically said yes to a ceasefire in its war with iraq it 
became the latest in a string of nations to opt for a peaceful 
solution to a bloody war that failed 
the eightyear conflict with iraq had already cost both sides an 
estimated 1 million casualties drained their economies and kept 
the middle east at boiling point 
but in a sudden reversal of policy iran on monday july 18 
accepted a united nations resolution calling on both iraq and iran 
to silence their guns a resolution iraq had accepted a year ago 
just a little before south africa angola and cuba agreed to a 
set of principles to end decadelong clashes among their troops in 
southern angola and to give southwest africa namibia also the 
scene of guerrilla fighting its independence 
then on thursday july 21 north korea invited the south korean 
parliament to begin talks with its communist counterpart on a 
nonaggression pact drawn up in pyongyang the north korean capital 
the two countries have lived under an uneasy truce that brought 
a war between them to a halt in 1953 each has accused the other of 
warlike acts since then and tension has run high at times along the 
demilitarized zone that separates them 
korea has been divided between north and south since the end of 
world war ii 
the three events last week came against a backdrop of other 
recent moves toward peace and a lessening of world tension 
the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan after nine years of war 
reports of soviet troop reductions in hungary and perhaps other 
east bloc nations 
continuing ussoviet talks on deeper nuclearweapons cuts 
talks beginning monday july 25 for a peaceful solution to the 
long guerrilla war in cambodia to be followed by talks on cambodia 
between the soviet union and china the worlds two most powerful 
communist nations 
its a very refreshing sign in 1988 that so many problems are 
now being approached in a different way said sir crispin 
tickell britains ambassador to the united nations who sits on 
the security council i call it a victory for common sense 
lets hope peace is contagious added the us ambassador to 
the united nations vernon a walters who is also on the security 
council people are tired 
by far the most stunning development was irans sudden 
abandonment of its longstanding demand that iraq be branded the 
aggressor in their war as a first step toward peace 
iraq had proposed facetoface negotiations with iran fearing a 
unsponsored ceasefire effort could stop short of peace 
so far iran has rejected direct talks leading baghdad to 
suggest tehrans acceptance of a ceasefire may be only a tactic as 
part of an ongoing war 
however security council resolution 598 which iran accepted 
unconditionally contains provisions for a peace process after a 
ceasefire is established 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has dispatched 
military observers to begin working out details of a ceasefire 
and diplomats say it looks as though peace could come to the front 
for the first time since september 1980 
nearly as startling as irans move was south africas agreement 
the week before last with angola and cuba on principles for the 
withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops from angola and to end south 
african rule over neighboring southwest africa 
a timetable for the cuban withdrawal has not yet been set but 
the three nations agreed the united nations will supervise 
elections and the establishment of black majority rule in 
southwest africa over a oneyear period 
south africa has governed the territory under a league of 
nations mandate granted during world war i the un security 
council revoked the mandate in 1978 calling for an independent 
namibia

cuban troops have been defending the marxist government of 
angola from an anticommunist insurgency by unita the national 
union for the total liberation of angola and recently the cubans 
and their angolan allies have clashed with south african troops 
sent over the border from namibia to back unita unita has also 
received diplomatic and military support from the united states 
even earlier at the un general assemblys special session on 
disarmament in june many nations lauded recent ussoviet 
diplomatic agreements on nuclear arms reduction saying their 
example should inspire regional powers and the developing nations 
to reach peace pacts and reduce their arsenals 
and in central europe the warsaw pact allies offered this month 
to negotiate conventional force imbalances with their nato 
counterparts this year and accepted the wests demand that the 
talks cover weapons as well as troop levels 
the us state department said earlier this month that it 
appears moscow may withdraw 65000 red army troops from hungary or 
10000 from poland as a unilateral gesture 
the warsaw pact has called for each side to reduce its forces by 
about 500000 troops 
the north atlantic treaty organization allies have said the 
warsaw pact has superior forces and must make greater reductions 
than the west 
in afghanistan the soviet withdrawal that began may 15 
continues under un supervision and is to be completed by feb 
15 1989 ending nine years of kremlin effort to put down armed 
opposition to the communist kabul government by moslem guerrillas 
known as mujahedeen the accords were mediated by the united 
nations and signed by neighbors pakistan and afghanistan with 
washington and moscow acting as guarantors 
a decadelong guerrilla war in cambodia could begin winding down 
after peace talks start monday in bogor indonesia 
communist vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to oust the 
communist khmer rouge who held power since 1975 about 2 million 
of cambodias 8 million people died from khmer rouge executions 
famine and civil unrest until the vietnamese ended their rule 
the khmer rouge turned to guerrilla warfare and since 1979 has 
been the most powerful force battling heng samrins government in 
phnom penh which is supported by about 140000 of hanois troops 
the coalition of cambodian resistance groups also includes the 
noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front and 
followers of the former cambodian head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk china is the main supporter of the resistance 
vietnam is withdrawing its troops from cambodia and says they 
all will be out by 1990 foreign minister nguyen co thach of 
vietnam has said that the long antiguerrilla campaign has become 
vietnams vietnam 
the indonesian talks will be the first among all of cambodias 
warring groups 
in addition to the three guerrilla groups and the current 
cambodian government the talks will include vietnam laos and the 
members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand 
indonesia singapore malaysia the philippines and brunei 
a diplomatic approach to three insurgencies in central america 
has met only limited success 
last august the presidents of nicaragua honduras el salvador 
guatemala and costa rica signed a peace accord that links truces in 
central america with the withdrawal of military forces and 
equipment supplied by outside powers and the restoration of civil 
liberties 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega last tuesday extended a 
unilateral truce in the 7yearold war against the contra rebels 
until aug 30 and called on the usbacked contras to resume 
talks to work out a permanent ceasefire 
the contras seem unprepared to handle a peace process rifts 
within their ranks between those who want to fight and those who 
are willing to discuss a poltical settlement have left the rebels 
in disarray 
an impasse has developed in el salvador where cancerstricken 
president jose napoleon duarte has called upon leftist rebel groups 
to lay down their weapons after eight years of guerrilla war and 
join the constitutional process of government 
in guatemala the peace plan stalled when the guatemalan workers 
party the political front for leftist rebels declared a 
government general amnesty offer unacceptable

informal negotiations set for monday 
have sparked a glimmer of hope that two decades of savage conflict 
in cambodia may end through political compromise 
for the first time officials of the squabbling cambodian 
resistance coalition are scheduled to meet with representatives of 
the heng samrin government that vietnam installed in phnom penh 
cambodias capital after its 1978 invasion of its neighbor 
foreign minister ali alatas of indonesia who cautions against 
unrealistic expectations for the talks will serve as 
moderator the meetings are to be held at the presidential palace 
in bogor a mountain retreat about 40 miles south of jakarta 
more than 30 years ago the palace was the site for a meeting of 
prime ministers from burma india indonesia sri lanka and 
pakistan the meeting led to the afroasia conference in nearby 
bandung in 1955 that preceded the formation of the nonaligned 
movement more commonly called the third world 
if mondays opening session goes smoothly it will be expanded 
later in the week to include vietnam laos and delegates from the 
six members of the association of southeast asian nations 
thailand indonesia singapore malaysia the philippines and 
brunei 
the phased nature of the gathering was conceived three years ago 
by mochtar kusumaatmadja then indonesias foreign minister he 
decided that a casual cocktail party format where everyone 
could come but at different times might finally succeed in bringing 
the warring factions together 
moderator alatas and others stress that the informal talks have 
no agenda are preliminary in nature and are designed to find 
enough common ground on which to base formal negotiations 
since 1970 cambodia has suffered a devastating fiveyear war a 
reign of terror by the communist khmer rouge the vietnamese 
invasion and a continuing guerrilla war millions have perished 
contributing to the cautious optimism was a report from 
washington that the envoys of the soviet union and china have 
agreed to meet in beijing next month to work on a cambodian peace 
plan a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
meeting hinged on developments in bogor 
while neither the soviets nor the chinese have a direct role in 
the longrunning conflict both hold sway over allies who are 
directly involved moscow backs vietnam and china arms the 
coalition guerrillas 
vietnams leader nguyen van linh said all vietnamese troops 
will leave cambodia by early 1990 instead of the end of 1990 as 
previously announced according to a vietnam news agency report 
monitored friday in bangkok thailand 
deep suspicions over vietnams motives remain in some quarters 
so do fears of a return to power by the brutal khmer rouge the 
strongest member of a coalition that seems to stick together 
because they hate vietnam slightly more than each other the others 
are anticommunists under former premier son sann and followers of 
prince norodom sihanouk 
sihanouk who resigned on july 10 as head of the resistance 
coalition accused vietnam on thursday of being unwilling to 
conduct serious talks 
he is not supposed to appear in bogor but has accepted an 
invation to visit indonesia for a few days this week as the 
personal guest of president suharto alatas said sihanouks son 
prince norodom ranariddh would head his fathers faction in the 
talks

thirtyfive years after an armistice 
ended the korean war tensions on the divided peninsula remain high 
and conditions for another war are still there 
the war of 195053 left both nations in devastation and more 
than 1 million soldiers and civilians dead or wounded the united 
states committed 57 million soldiers sailors and airmen to the 
korean war under the banner of the united nations and 33629 of 
them died in battle 
today hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops of both 
sides face each other along the 150mile demilitarized zone in 
virtually the same positions they held the day the armistice was 
signed july 27 1953 
prowestern south korea and communist north korea each insists 
it is the only legitimate government and both struggle now for 
supremacy on the 600mile peninsula 
reuniting korea is the goal of both governments but each calls 
the other puppets the south of the americans and the north of the 
soviets 
technically the north and the south are still at war while an 
armistice ended the fighting in 1953 no peace treaty has been 
signed the two nations have no ties the demilitarized zone which 
divides them at the 38th parallel is sealed and they have no links 
except for a single hotline 
the two sides have been engaged in frequent clashes since 1953 
but so far they have avoided another war few signs point to an 
end however to one of the worlds most dangerous power struggles 
president roh taewoo of south korea called on july 7 for an end 
to confrontation and the opening of peaceful ties he proposed 
trade political and cultural links to lead to eventual 
reunification 
we should be able to find a breakthrough toward a lasting 
peace and unification on the korean peninsula which is still 
fraught with the danger of war roh said 
north korea ridiculed rohs plan and said it was not worth 
considering the north also refused to even accept a letter from 
the south on july 15 calling for student exchange visits 
south korea however said it would at least consider a north 
korean proposal july 21 for interparliamentary talks on a framing 
a nonaggression pact 
rohs proposals were similar to other iniatives by the south and 
there was little sign the new ones would lead to a breakthrough 
three rounds of talks between the two nations since 1971 on 
reducing tensions and building ties collapsed 
both want to reunite the peninsula but neither is willing to 
abandon its political system or renounce its claims to be the sole 
government of korea 
south korea achieved a major political and diplomatic victory 
over the north by becoming the site for the 1988 olympic games 
starting in september the south makes little secret of the fact 
that it sees the games as international recognition of its claim to 
be the true korean government 
the olympics will mark a critical turning point for seoul to 
achieve permanent superiority over pyongyang the official korean 
development institute of seoul said in a report pyongyang is north 
koreas capital 
north korea furious over seouls olympics accomplishment plans 
to boycott the games unless it can be the cohost olympic 
authorities have refused and the norths hopes of a major boycott 
by its communist allies collapsed when the soviet union and china 
entered the games 
the korean peninsula was divided by soviet and us forces that 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii efforts 
to reunite failed and rival governments were formed in 1948 the 
north invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
in addition to the united states 15 other nations sent troops 
to help south korea during the war and today 42000 us troops 
remain in the country 
memories of the war haunt both nations and fuel mutual mistrust 
the korean war made unification an impossible task said 
choi janksok a south korean political analyst tensions between 
the two koreas have never been reduced 
south korean cities hold monthly air raid drills men serve in 
militias or civil defense units until they are 50 years old and 
army units on maneuvers are a common sight seoul is dotted with 
gun emplacements disguised as flower beds and fortifications ring 
the city which is within artillery range of north korea 
north korea has repeatedly attacked the south including a 1983 
bombing against former president chun doohwan and his cabinet that 
killed 16 people 
the north was implicated in the bombing nov 29 of a south 
korean airliner with the loss of all 115 people aboard as part of 
attempts to disrupt the olympics 
north korea is one of the most regimented police states in the 
world with the government controlling almost every aspect of life 
the country is virtually closed to foreigners 
its supreme leader 75yearold kim il sung has built up a huge 
personality cult that portrays him as a sort of marxist god people 
are drilled from childhood to revere him as the great leader 
kim who has been in power since 1945 started the korean war 
and observers say unification is impossible while he rules the 
north 
nothing has changed in the north and as a matter of fact the 
situation in the north is getting worse said professor rhee 
chongik of south koreas chongju university 
north korea with a population of just 20 million has the sixth 
largest army in the world with 800000 troops and as many as 5 
million in reserve it has a 3to1 lead in jets aircraft tanks 
and other weapons but much of its weaponry is old and one third of 
its planes are of korean war vintage according to western 
estimates 
north korea hobbled by bureaucracy also has seen its economy 
fall into chaos huge resources are swallowed up by the army life 
in the north is spartan and there are reports of food shortages 
the balance of power has changed in recent years as the souths 
soaring economy has turned it into a growing asian power the 
south with a population of 41 million has outstripped the north 
at almost every level 
seouls increasingly powerful military with 650000 men and 3 
million reserves has a technological lead that outweighs the 
norths numerical superiority analysts say south korean leaders 
say they will be able to do without us military aid by the late 
1990s 
the roh government which took office in february has pledged 
to end decades of authoritarian rule in the south and a major 
political liberalization has been the result the government says 
it is building a democratic system that will end south koreas 
internal divisions 
some political leaders intellectuals and others say the reforms 
must include a major effort to end the confrontation with the north 
as the united states deals with the soviet union we can deal 
with north korea with a careful and sincere attitude said 
opposition leader kim daejung 
reunification has been freely debated in the south as the 
government lifted controls that had made the subject taboo south 
koreans want reunification but not if it means communist rule 
peace advocates hope better relations between the superpowers 
can ease the confrontation 
it would be exceedingly difficult for north korea to resist 
the trend of the times and insist on keeping its doors hermetically 
sealed said analyst kim youngwon

american telephone amp telegraph cos chairman 
dismayed by an unexpected spurt in employment has announced a 
companywide hiring freeze and ordered a shift of 3000 managers 
into sales and marketing 
the freeze is the first since the breakup of the bell system in 
1984 and may be the first ever for atampt which was sheltered from 
competition for most of its existence 
the freeze which will last indefinitely excludes only some 
college recruiting and jobs that are strategic to marketing 
efforts here and abroad spokesman burke stinson said thursday 
after shrinking steadily since 1984 when it divested the 
regional bell telephone companies atampts employment has risen by 
12000 since the beginning of this year 
atampt chairman robert e allen who announced the plan to 
employees in a closedcircuit television broadcast wednesday said 
administrative costs were rising too rapidly and he wanted to 
emphasize increasing sales 
on wednesday the company reported an unusually large 14 percent 
secondquarter increase in its selling general and administrative 
expenses that rise which atampt now is moving to deal with 
contributed to a 03 percent slippage in profits 
atampt is recruiting volunteers for sales and marketing jobs from 
among its 95000 entrylevel and secondlevel managers although 
all managers are eligible stinson said 
were moving people from field tents to the front line 
stinson said atampt continues to lose money in the computer business 
and has been hardpressed by competitors in longdistance telephone 
service its breadandbutter business mci communications corp 
its closest rival this week reported record profit and revenue for 
the latest quarter 
stinson said allen regards the employment increase this year as 
unacceptable although one reason for the sharp rise is that atampt 
began counting the 4500 employees of atampt philips 
telecommunications a european joint venture with nv philips in 
which atampt took a majority interest earlier this year 
james e olson allens predecessor who died in april after a 
bout with colon cancer oversaw a reduction of 27000 employees in 
his 1 years at the helm 
atampts employment fell from 374000 at the time of divestiture 
on jan 1 1984 to 365200 at the end of 1984 337600 at the end 
of 1985 316900 at the end of 1986 and 303000 at the end of 1987 
it is now about 315000 
of the 3000 people moving into sales more than 1000 already 
have been recruited stinson said that is because the move to 
shift people into sales began in april in two atampt units the 
business markets group and network operations group

britains robert maxwell has emerged as a bidder 
to compete with hostile suitor robert bass for macmillan inc but 
apparently not as the white knight that many analysts have been 
expecting to appear and rescue macmillan 
maxwell communications the media company headed by the 
flamboyant publisher said thursday it had offered to buy macmillan 
in a conditional bid that values the company at 207 billion 
maxwell stated he would pay 80 a share for the 259 million 
outstanding shares of macmillan the publishing giant that already 
faces a hostile 19 billion tender offer from robert m bass group 
but macmillan issued a brief statement saying the maxwell offer 
was unsolicited and would be considered in due course along 
with the bass bid 
macmillan stock closed up 425 at 8287 per share reflecting 
speculation that a higher bid yet would emerge 
bass which already holds a 99 percent stake in macmillan 
launched a 75ashare tender offer monday for the shares it does 
not already own the spokesman for bass was said to be out of his 
office and unavailable for comment thursday 
edward p evans macmillans chairman and chief executive 
officer stated that macmillan vigorously was attempting to 
overturn a ruling that prevents the company from proceeding with an 
extensive restructuring program announced after basss initial 
overtures 
the restructuring which includes paying shareholders a special 
dividend and splitting the company into two separate public 
entities was blocked last week by the delaware chancery court at 
basss request macmillan is appealing to the delaware supreme 
court 
maxwells offer was conditioned upon the termination of the 
restructuring plan and macmillans poison pill takeover 
defense and approval by the macmillan board and shareholders 
in a letter to evans maxwell also requested his company get the 
same access to confidential corporate information as macmillans 
investment bankers 
maxwell communications north american headquarters based in 
greenwich conn control printing telecommunications database 
services and publishing operations with annual revenue approaching 
1 billion 
some of the operations compete against macmillans publishing 
and information services units a macmillan spokesman said 
bert boksen an analyst at raymond james financial corp in st 
petersburg fla said the entry of maxwell into the bidding 
further complicates the situation for the macmillan board it 
will probably force them to find a true white knight 
he predicted a third bidder would surface and an auction would 
ensue that would send macmillan to the highest bidder 
i still think the company is worth 90 to 95 a share 
boksen said 
coniston partners an aggressive new york investment firm that 
holds a 49 stake in macmillan has maintained the company is worth 
at least 85 a share 
robert maxwells worldwide operations reported 1987 sales of 884 
million pounds or about 153 billion at current exchange rates 
in his most recent annual report maxwell said the company was 
on the road to becoming a global information and communications 
empire before the end of the decade with annual revenues of 3 to 5 
million pounds with profit to match 
maxwells company is the largest printer in britain owns the 
mirror group of newspapers in britain and publishes scientific 
journals 
maxwell recently encountered the bass group when it acquired a 
23 percent stake in bell amp howell co maxwell ultimately decided 
against making a bid for the illinois information services company 
which bass acquired in may for 700 million 
earlier this year maxwell offered 2 billion for harcourt brace 
jovanovich inc a publishing theme park and insurance concern 
but withdrew the offer after harcourt undertook a 3 billion 
recapitalization 
maxwell communication still spent 1 billion making smaller 
acquisitions in the united states this past year

general motors corp and industry analysts credit 
the automakers 29 percent increase in its secondquarter earnings 
to a return to profitability in its north american automaking 
business and continued strong results overseas 
gm barely broke even building cars and trucks in north america 
in 1987 reaping 356 billion in 1987 profit from accounting 
changes tax benefits and record contributions from its streamlined 
overseas businesses and its subsidiaries 
but secondquarter revenue for the nations biggest automaker 
rose 12 percent to 299 billion from 267 billion a year ago 
breaking the previous quarterly record of 276 billion set in 1986 
when the auto industry set a 163 millionvehicle annual sales 
record 
gm reported net earnings of 15 billion or 452 a common 
share up from 117 billion or 339 a common share in the 
second quarter a year ago 
it was a good quarter the number of units produced per 
employee went up almost 17 percent versus secondquarter last year 
thats phenomenally good showing the kind of earnings general 
motors can have if sales pick up said ronald glantz analyst 
with montgomery securities inc in san francisco 
car and light truck sales in 1988 have continued to surge well 
ahead of pessimistic predictions issued in the wake of the october 
1987 stock market crisis expectations for the year have risen to a 
consensus of about 156 million vehicles and gm has benefited from 
the industrys surprisingly strong performance 
last year sales volume was so low that most of their gains 
came from accounting changes this year it seems based on volume 
sales were strong in the first half particularly in the second 
quarter said kathleen heaney analyst with nikko securities 
international in new york 
secondquarter revenue rose 12 percent from a year ago and broke 
the previous gm record for any quarter of 276 billion set in 
1986 gm said the earnings were the best for any quarter since 
second quarter 1984 
gm also said that as of june 30 it had shaved 27 billion of 
the 4 billion it plans to trim from its costs during 1988 
in the second quarter operating income rose 64 percent to 
175 billion from 107 billion a year earlier it rose 16 percent 
in the first six months to 24 billion from 208 billion a year 
ago 
gm said the improvement came both from a return to stronger 
profitability in north america and overseas performance stronger 
than last years record however gm said it does not provide 
income for different geographic areas on a quarterly basis 
gms worldwide vehicle sales rose 93 percent in the second 
quarter to 225 million 
at the end of the second quarter gms north americanbuilt cars 
and light trucks held 351 percent of the us market up slightly 
from 338 percent at the end of june 1987 
in the first six months of 1988 gm earnings rose 133 percent 
to 26 billion or 763 a share on revenue of 5634 billion 
from 229 billion or 665 a share on revenue of 528 billion a 
year ago 
on wednesday gm reported earnings by its three subsidiaries 
general motors acceptance corp electronic data systems corp and 
gm hughes electronics corp 
gm blamed higher interest expenses and a drop in auto financings 
for an 189 percent drop in gmac earnings secondquarter earnings 
for eds and hughes were up 33 percent and 164 percent 
respectively

consumer prices climbed a modest 03 percent 
in june with declines in gasoline and clothing costs nearly 
offsetting a sharp increase in food prices the government said 
today 
the overall june increase which matched the rise for may would 
amount to an annual inflation rate of 42 percent if prices climbed 
at the same pace for 12 straight months the labor department said 
grocery store prices rose a sharp 07 percent but there seemed 
to be little effect from the summers drought other than the huge 
54 percent rise in poultry prices and the even steeper 66 percent 
gain in egg costs 
cereal and bakery prices not yet showing the full effects of 
the drought were up 04 percent 
grocery store prices reflecting upward pressures before the 
drought took hold had risen 05 percent in may and 08 percent in 
april 
as for meat analysts expect prices to fall later in the summer 
as producers facing staggering feed prices sell off parts of 
their herds but donald ratajczak an economist who conducts his 
own price surveys from the georgia state university in atlanta 
said in advance of todays report that some retailers have not yet 
passed their lower wholesale prices on to consumers 
indeed pork prices rose 12 percent last month while beef 
prices gained 13 percent 
as for energy gasoline costs driven downward by worldwide 
drops in crude oil prices dipped a significant 09 percent after 
rising 16 percent in may 
clothing prices fell 03 percent after rising a strong 38 
percent through the first five months of 1988 department analysts 
attributed the decline to larger than usual markdowns in prices for 
womens clothing 
the 03 percent seasonally adjusted gain in the consumer price 
index left the annualized inflation rate for the first half of 1988 
at 44 percent the same as for all of 1987 
the index itself stood at 1180 in june meaning that a 
selection of goods costing 100 during a 198284 base period would 
have cost 118 last month 50 cents more than in the preceding 
month and 450 more than a year ago 
excluding the effects of the volatile food and energy 
categories retail prices rose 04 percent in june double mays 
02 percent increase 
the department gave these details of junes price changes 
cooking oil prices were up 04 percent while dairy product 
costs fell 02 percent prices of fruits and vegetables edged 
downward 01 percent restaurant meal prices gained 04 percent 
food prices including meals eaten outside the home rose 06 
percent 
energy prices overall were down 02 percent fuel oil prices 
dropped 06 percent while natural gas and electricity costs gained 
04 percent 
prices for infants and toddlers clothing were off 10 
percent followed by a 08 percent drop in the costs of womens and 
girls clothing and a 01 percent dip in mens and boys clothing 
housing costs rose 03 percent the same as in may and april 
medical care expenses were up 04 percent less than in recent 
months but 64 percent greater than at this time last year 
new car prices rose 03 percent faster than the 01 percent 
gains of april and may 
the governments monthly inflation reports are attracting 
growing attention as the financial markets worry about the impact 
of rising prices on the strength of the economy 
factories last month operated closer to capacity than at any 
time in eight years raising fears that strong demand will free 
manufacturers to raise prices meanwhile unemployment fell to 53 
percent a 14year low and heightened concern that workers will be 
able to demand higher wages 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a 
washingtonbased consulting firm said consumer resistance to 
higher prices is discouraging inflation outside the food and energy 
categories 
clients wring their hands and tear their hair in many 
industries restaurants womens apparel electronics you can 
virtually only sell something if its on sale she said 
ratajczak warned that the longterm outlook for inflation is not 
as good as over the next month or so after meat prices fall 
because of an increase in slaughtering prices will go up and stay 
up for at least a year in response to a shortage of animals 
also the low unemployment rate will begin to be felt in an 
increase in the price of services he said 
an upward tilt in inflation appears fairly inevitable he 
said next year could be a problem year but it wont be 
explosive

the federal deposit insurance corp is talking 
with prospective buyers for the 70 percent stake in continental 
illinois corp it acquired in bailing out the banking firm four 
years ago the agencys chairman said 
while revealing the talks on the continental illinois shares l 
william seidman refused to say thursday who has expressed an 
interesting in purchasing the shares 
he also said he couldnt predict when a sale might be completed 
id love to come to a conclusion soon he said after 
speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the chicago association of 
commerce and industry 
we would be happy to talk to anybody who wants to acquire an 
interest and who is a qualified buyer he said 
seidman refused to say what price the fdic would want for its 
continental shares but said the ages stake at a reasonable 
price 
continental stock was up 37 cents a share to 550 in early new 
york stock exchange trading today 
the fdic sold about 10 percent of its continental stock in 
november 1986 receiving 525 a share 
continental nearly collapsed four years ago but since its 
bailout the banks financial condition has improved and it is 
restructuring its operations to concentrate on commercial banking 
seidman described continental as a great bank with a strong 
management and wellcapitalized 
the fdic is apparently seeking to reduce its investment in the 
chicago bank at a time when it is facing growing losses from bank 
failures in texas 
seidman said he expects the fund which had a total net worth of 
183 billion at the end of 1987 to lose about 10 percent this 
year as a result of payouts in bank failures and assistance to 
threatened banks 
this would be the first loss in the net worth of its deposit 
insurance fund since the agency was founded in 1933

the dollar and stock prices declined sharply in 
tokyo today after steep falls in new york overnight 
the dollar which lost 220 yen in new york thursday declined 
142 yen to finish the week at 13208 yen in tokyo 
traders said the us currency stayed within a range of 
1316313220 yen in slow trading 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which soared 40495 points on thursday retreated 
39113 points or 141 percent today to close at 2728501 
it was the worst singleday decline in the nikkei since tuesday 
when the index plunged 51303 points in the previous worst 
singleday loss the nikkei average lost 39435 points on may 19 
volume traded on the markets first section was 17 billion 
shares compared to 18 billion the day before 
a bank of japan official attributed the dollars sharp decline 
to the impact of cooperative intervention by central banks 
according to kyodo news service 
tuesdays reported intervention by the bank of japan to stop the 
fall of the west german mark was seen as a sign of determination by 
central banks to stabilize exchange rates 
exchange dealers attributed the dollars downturn in tokyo 
directly to the sharp overnight drop in new york 
i dont see any outstanding factor in tokyo which could bring 
down the dollar said a dealer at a major us investment bank in 
tokyo 
other dealers said investment banks actively sold the dollar in 
early morning trading following its decline in new york causing 
the dollars fall 
after opening at 13185 yen the us currency regained the 
132yen level at late morning when news reports quoted finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa as saying the yens sudden appreciation 
was not significant dealers said 
brokers attributed the decline in share prices to a 24point 
fall in the dow jones industrial average on wall street overnight 
the market as a whole is down but particular shares mostly 
large capital issues have been barely holding the index up during 
the past few weeks said keiichi nishida of kidder peabody so 
when those large shares like steels shipbuildings and electronics 
fall the nikkei index plunges as if something very serious 
happened 
nishida said major japanese securities companies including 
nomura daiwa yamaichi and nikko securities were encouraging 
investors to buy large capital issues to keep the market index up 
the exchanges index does not necessarily reflect the real 
market situation in japan unlike on wall street he said 
meanwhile workers at the tokyo stock exchange went on an

after 50 years of building carlson 
companies inc into the nations 14th largest private company the 
richest man in minnesota is patting his pockets and contemplating 
the future of his empire 
my biggest concern now is to make sure the earnings are there 
so that it doesnt make bums out of my grandchildren said curt 
carlson a 74yearold entrepreneur who is in the process of 
changing the guard at his 4 billion travel restaurant hotel and 
business incentive company 
the heir apparent to the sanctum that controls radisson hotels 
ask mr foster travel agencies and tgi fridays and country 
kitchen restaurants is edwin skip gage who is married to 
carlsons daughter barbara 
the choice was between gage who is president and chief 
operating officer and marilyn nelson carlsons other daughter 
who serves on the board and is director of community affairs for 
the company 
the time will come when theyll be vying against each other 
carlson predicted 
but im telling them dont let the company come down to 
nothing sell it before that happens 
for carlson its a problem he never dreamed of confronting when 
he quit a comfortable sales job with procter amp gamble co in 1938 
to start the gold bond stamp co in minneapolis 
fifty years later carlson is celebrating his enormous success 
by hosting a sitdown dinner saturday for 4000 people he even 
hired bob hope to entertain 
the first banker he approached half a century ago called the 
idea of selling trading stamps to grocery stores a damn fool 
scheme but it proved to be a stroke of genius that earned 
carlson his first million dollars by age 39 
since then he has accumulated a net worth of at least 640 
million by building the trading stamp operation the first to go 
nationwide into a conglomerate of 75 businesses employing more 
than 50000 people 
i enjoy my status carlson said from his mansion on lake 
minnetonka west of minneapolis im in with the crowd and i kind 
of like that 
impressive stuff for a former c student at the university of 
minnesota who came from ordinary means and worked his way through 
school by delivering newspapers and driving a soda pop truck 
early in his career he shared the company 5050 with a partner 
but carlson bought him out because their work ethics clashed 
each year hed say lets not work this hard carlson 
recalled he liked to go to the club 
arleen carlson said her husband of 50 years has been considering 
retiring for the past 10 to 15 years he hasnt because he loves to 
work she said 
its his brainchild mrs carlson said of the company 
hes a leader and its difficult to make the break 
but carlson said he is finally prepared to step down as chief 
executive officer to become a longrange strategic adviser 
im not going to be the kind of chairman who still stays in 
there and runs it he said 
thats hard to believe from a man who has been known to call his 
grandchildren on sundays when hes out of town to make sure theyve 
gone to church carlson is still the undisputed leader of the 
company and his decisions are final 
for example an executive of the company recently approached him 
about going into the gaming business with one of the companys 
hotels 
as long as im alive therell never be any gaming said 
carlson who said he once sat on the board of directors of a 
company that lost money in an apparent skimming operation at a las 
vegas hotel 
what carlson said he dreads most about the future is the 
inevitable family friction that will follow his death its not his 
two daughters and seven grandchildren he worries about its the 
descendants who havent been born yet 
i havent been able to influence them he said 
so carlson wants to forestall as long as possible the era of a 
rich and idle carlson clan by keeping family members employed but 
to land a job at the company theyll be required to work for at 
least three years on the outside 
i think you have to be gainfully employed to be really 
happy he said 
gainful employment in carlsons company means working at least 
six days a week if you want to climb the ladder said dick adrian 
a former carlson companies vice president who quit in 1982 after 
seeing many a middle manager depart for jobs with equal pay and 
fewer demands at other companies 
he doesnt pay any more than he has to adrian said and 
at curts establishment its business first everything else 
second 
but adrian said most carlson alumni respect the founder for his 
drive and business cunning even though carlson considers himself 
an entrepreneur he managed the company tightly and as recently as 
the late 1970s demanded to make the final decision on any expense 
larger than 50000 adrian said 
its amazing how much he knew about all the divisions 
adrian said he and skip have a real close relationship with the 
numbers in all those divisions 
adrian said he once saw carlson pacing and yelling after 
being notified that one of his aquisitions contained a surprise 
liability 
im not exactly positive but i think they went back to check 
the structure of the ceiling in his office adrian said 
gage said his fatherinlaw is an expert deal maker when 
trading stamps faded in 1968 carlson went on a diversification 
binge by adding to his acquisition of the radisson hotel in 
minneapolis with investments in business incentive companies 
travel agencies more hotels other real estate and restaurants 
the largest profit center in the conglomerate carlson said is 
ef macdonald motivation co an incentive company he purchased in 
1981 that counts general motors goodrich tires and chrysler corp 
as its customers 
although he is not well known nationally carlson is a legend in 
minnesota and a dignitary in sweden where his grandfather was a 
farmer carlson and his wife are friends with the king and queen of 
sweden and carlson was named swedishamerican of the year in 
stockholm in 1981 
among his celebrated causes in minnesota carlson was one of 
seven businessmen who put up a total of 10 million to help develop 
the metrodome he also contributed 400000 to the 1984 buyout of 
twins tickets that kept former owner calvin griffith from moving 
the team to florida in 1986 carlson put up 25 million for the 
university of minnesota to spark a fund drive that raised 350 
million 
he lives his commitments said carl platou president of 
fairview hospitals and health systems where carlson has been a 
board member for 25 years 
he helps people understand what the future is going to be

eastern airlines said today it will eliminate 
4000 jobs and cut service to 14 cities on aug 31 and leave its 
western hub in a costcutting move one union immediately called a 
slap in the face 
we are preserving the airline were strengthening the 
airline i dont care to place the blame anywhere eastern 
president phil bakes said citing high operating costs and 
competition for a 182 million loss in 1987 
personnel cuts through layoff and early retirement will affect 
union and nonunion employees and management bakes said they will 
include some 520 jobs in miami 300 in atlanta and 350 in kansas 
city mo which no longer will be the carriers western hub 
easterns operations in boston new york washington atlanta 
and miami will be the core of the carriers service he said 
the 12 percent reduction in workforce will free a proportional 
percentage easterns fleet which will be sold he said 
eastern said service will be suspended in the following cities 
beginning aug 31 albuquerque nm fort de france martinique 
las vegas nev minneapolisst paul minn oklahoma city okla 
omaha neb dallas pointeapitre guadeloupe renolake tahoe 
nev san antonio texas san diego calif st lucia west 
indies tuscon ariz and tulsa okla 
eastern is locked in bitter contract talks with its machinists 
union the union is seeking raises for the 10000 workers it 
represents while the carrier is pressing for 161 million in such 
cost concessions as pay cuts 
the carrier seeks another 69 million in concessions from its 
pilots union which began formal contract talks with the company 
friday 
we feel this is a very cavalier action by texas air and a real 
slap in the face to the loyal eastern employees of kansas city who 
made the hub a success said ron cole spokesman for the air line 
pilots association 
the unions contend that frank lorenzos texas air corp is 
trying to dismantle eastern selling off profitable assets and then 
folding it into a sister subsidiary since texas air bought eastern 
for 676 million in november 1986 a sale the carriers three major 
unions unsuccessfully tried to block in court eastern has been 
trimmed considerably 
easterns parent firm texas air ended last year 466 million in 
the red 
miami civic and business leaders are lobbying for federal 
mediators to declare an impasse in the 7monthold talks with 
machinists an impasse would trigger a 30day cooling off 
period under federal law the union would be free after that to 
strike and the company to impose its latest proposal 
the iam is seeking a twoyear contract with raises of 15 
percent and 5 percent which eastern says will cost 50 million 
yearly

mcgrawhill inc has a good chance of tracking 
down the culprit if someone leaked advance information on stocks 
spotlighted in its widely read business week magazine experts said 
friday 
the publisher said thursday that its legal counsel is 
investigating suspicious price movements and heavy trading in 
stocks mentioned in the inside wall street column before 
business week was available to the public 
while the investigation encompasses mcgrawhills entire 
operation from its inhouse staff to the four plants where 
business week is printed the experts expressed doubt the 
magazines editorial staff was involved 
most agreed the conviction of a wall street journal reporter who 
leaked advance information to a stockbroker would deter journalists 
from making a similar error in judgment 
in 1985 reporter r foster winans was convicted of passing tips 
about items scheduled to appear in the financial newspapers 
influential heard on the street column he was sentenced to 18 
months in prison 
you would think the winans case would scare editorial 
people said ralph ferrara former general counsel of the 
securities and exchange commission and a partner of the new york 
law firm of debevoise amp plimpton 
the winans case was far simpler to investigate because that 
column was written by only two reporters handled by a few editors 
and printed immediately the experts said they said extensive 
legwork would be required to follow business weeks publication 
trail 
the magazines 960000 weekly issues are printed early thursday 
morning released to the press after the market closes that day and 
to the general public on friday 
in order to trace the leak mcgrawhill is likely to team up 
with the enforcement operations of stock exchanges and ultimately 
the sec 
that way mcgrawhill can get the names of the purchasers and 
sellers of the stocks and match them with the files of their 
employees ferrara said 
if the leak occurred at one of the plants which are located in 
connecticut california wisconsin and pennsylvania and do contract 
work for mcgrawhill it would be more difficult to track but still 
possible the experts said 
james ratcliffe director of public affairs at rr donnelley amp 
sons inc which prints business week in connecticut and 
california said the company had launched its own investigation 
separate from mcgrawhills inquiry 
he said that while only about 150 employees work the night shift 
when business week is printed in connecticut almost anybody at 
the plant could lay their hands on it the plant employs 550 
people 
sam scott miller a partner in the new york firm orrick 
herrington amp sutcliffe and a member of the securities industry 
associations trading practices committee said its certainly 
easier to connect up with a printer whos doing it in his own name 
and its not too much more difficult to find someone whos 
brotherinlaw or cousin is trading on the information 
it is difficult to finger someone with no business or social 
connection to the information but its definitely still 
possible scott said 
these people dont just pop up out of the blue he said 
adding that the first thing investigators do is make geographical 
connections among the trades 
once a pattern is nailed down authorities begin questioning 
individuals 
the sec and the stock exchanges have proven to be 
extraordinarily resourceful in networking these deals ferrara 
said with a little information from personnel files youll be 
surprised how bells and whistles start to engage 
there have been a number of cases involving printers who traded 
on information taken from financial documents lawyers said but 
one problem is that a case is nearly impossible to build unless the 
employer has a policy specifically restricting such activity 
donnelleys ratcliffe said all employees are made aware that 
they are handling highly confidential information and any misuse 
will result in disciplinary action to date he said there have been 
no firings for that reason 
a spokesman for wa kreuger co which prints business week at 
a plant in wisconsin was said to be out of his office and 
unreachable for comment

crop futures closed mostly lower friday on the 
chicago board of trade in a lackluster session marked by 
uncertainty about the farm belt weather outlook for the weekend and 
beyond 
grain and soybean prices had fallen sharply earlier in the week 
as showers swept across the dusty midwest and the market has been 
unable to sustain a rally since then because of speculation that 
the drought pattern has weakened analysts said 
the bulls are really grasping here trying to get things 
recovered said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago what we need to make prices rise is a 
return to hot dry weather 
forecasters generally expected temperatures in the midwest to 
turn warmer over the weekend but some also predicted scattered 
showers and traders were hesitant to establish new positions 
everybodys a little gunshy because the last time we were 
supposed to just get showers we got some good rains said john 
frazier grain specialist with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
at the close wheat was 2 cents lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 384 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents lower with september at 312 a bushel corn was 
9 cents lower to 2 cents higher with september at 260 a bushel 
soybeans were 10 cents lower to 20 cents higher with august at

irving bank corp on friday urged bank of new 
york co to abandon its protracted takeover attempt saying the 
battle was effectively at an end since the hostile suitor gave 
no indication that it planned to wage another proxy battle 
but bank of new york spokesman owen brady said the company had 
no intention of ending its merger plans which began last 
september he said bank of new york could based on a court ruling 
seek another proxy vote on its nominees to irvings board of 
directors 
we have no present intention of waging another proxy battle 
but were not going to reveal our business strategies he 
said 
the new york supreme court overturning the result of a previous 
proxy vote recently ruled that holders of 10 percent of irvings 
stock had the right to call special meetings however the court 
confirmed the reelection of irvings board of directors which had 
been contested by bank of new york 
the state court also struck down a provision of irvings 
antitakeover poison pill intended to make unsolicited 
takeover bids prohibitively expensive although irving has appealed 
that ruling 
the provision would have allowed all shareholders except a 
hostile acquirer to buy 400 worth of irving shares for 200 if 
any suitor bought more than 20 percent of irving stock without the 
support of irvings management 
with this favorable court ruling regarding the boards 
reelection we believe that this hostile takeover attempt is 
effectively at an end irving said in a statment we urge 
bank of new yorks board to step in and direct its management to 
cease its hostile activities which have been disruptive and costly 
to both banking companies 
irvings board favors a friendly merger with the staterun banca 
commerciale italiana spa italys second largest bank 
banca commerciale offered 80 a share for 51 percent of irvings 
185 million common shares outstanding plus warrants entitling 
shareholders to buy newly issued irving stock at 65 a share over 
the next seven years stockholders would receive one warrant for 
every four shares they currently owned the blended value was as 
much as 7650 per share 
the merger proposal is part of a complex defensive restructuring 
plan that includes among other things sale of irving assets 
costcutting measures and a special cash dividend 
bank of new york which owns a 49 percent stake in irving is 
offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its own stock for each of 
irvings common shares outstanding the offer is valued at around 
68 a share or 12 billion 
bank of new york and many private banking analysts have 
maintained that bank of new yorks hostile offer was superior to 
that of banca commerciale largely because the new york bank already 
had received conditional regulatory approval that approval expires 
sept 7 
the takeover battle has attracted widespread interest in the 
banking industry because hostile bank takeover efforts are 
relatively rare

discovering more competition than 
expected american airlines told the state department it will not 
accept the authorization to fly between west berlin and three 
cities in west germany 
officials at the airline made the notification thursday because 
of the excessive capacity levels authorized on these routes 
making a profit woul be almost impossible american said 
the airline was surprised that the three nations that govern 
west berlin the united states france and britain had granted 
as much new service to the city as they did last month american 
spokesman steve mcgregor said 
weve run the numbers several times over the last few weeks 
and they just dont work for us in either a short or a longterm 
sense he said and this airline is just not prepared to enter 
into any markets where we know we would have to lose money for a 
long long time 
american petitioned the three nations late last year for 
permission to build a connecting hub complex in west berlin 
the airlines plan was to serve hamburg dusseldorf 
colognebonn frankfurt and munich in west germany zurich 
switzerland and vienna austria from west berlin three other 
us airlines followed with similar plans for west berlin service 
american pulled back after learning that the three nations 
authorized nearly twice as many new flights between west berlin and 
cities in the west as there had been previously 
american had been awarded four daily round trips to frankfurt 
three to munich and three to colognebonn trans world airlines was 
given four daily round trips to frankfurt two to hamburg and two 
to stuttgart west germany 
pan american world airways which had been the only us carrier 
serving west berlin was granted three more round trips daily to 
dusseldorf 
british airways plc which already serves west berlin was given 
28 new round trips a week between west berlin and frankfurt and a 
total of 56 new flights each week to points in the west 
also a new airline to be formed as a joint venture between air 
france which already serves west berlin and west germanys 
lufthansa was given 36 round trips a week to frankfurt 19 to 
colognebonn 25 to munich and 25 to stuttgart 
the three countries created rights to 120 new round trips 
between west berlin and frankfurt alone in hopes of stimulating 
price and service competition on what previously had been a tightly 
protected and highcost route 
mcgregor said four mcdonnell douglas md80 airplanes that 
american would have used for west berlin service will now be 
employed on domestic routes

polaroid corps stock jumped in heavy trading 
friday amid speculation that a white knight may emerge to 
compete with a bid that values the instant camera company at more 
than 2 billion 
polaroid rose 87 cents a share to finish at 4075 in composite 
new york stock exchange trading which was slightly above the 
40ashare roy e disney offered on wednesday through shamrock 
holdings inc 
nearly 26 million shares traded hands more than three times 
polaroids normal daily volume 
polaroid which jumped 775 on the week has hinted that it 
would reject the bid from disney nephew of the late walt disney 
the company said it had no comment on fridays stock movement 
among a number of rumors circulating in the finanical markets 
were hints that goldman sachs amp co had placed polaroid on its 
restricted list indicating it might be representing a bidder for 
the cambridge massbased company 
a goldman spokesman could not confirm or deny the rumor but 
dean witter reynolds inc analyst eugene glazer said goldman 
typically did not represent unwanted suitors by that firms 
nature they would not represent a hostile bidder he said 
it also was rumored that drexel burnham lambert inc had agreed 
to finance shamrocks bid 
among the speculative list of potential white knights is 
fuji photo film co of tokyo said b alex henderson a vice 
president and senior securities analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc 
among other companies that might be interested in polaroid from 
a strictly financial perspective were a handful of japanese 
consumer electronics companies including sony corp toshiba corp 
and hitachi ltd analysts said 
henderson noted that imaging is a very hot area right now and 
current developments in the computer arena make imagingrelated 
products much more important to the mainstream computing world 
shamrocks offer values polaroid at about 288 billion based on 
719 million shares outstanding but shamrock has indicated it 
might not proceed unless it manages to get the recent issue of 10 
million shares rescinded that would lower the value of the bid to 
248 billion 
polaroid unveiled a retrenchment plan earlier this month calling 
for layoffs and costcutting 
after disney unveiled his proposal polaroid management issued a 
statement reiterating its support for the restructuring we 
firmly believe that this is without doubt the right course for 
polaroid and for all of its shareholders employees customers and 
communities it said 
henderson said the plan gives a strong indication that 
they are going to protect themselves

if you mean newark nj why say pittsburgh 
asks the better business bureau of new york 
because pittsburgh isnt the issue says continental airlines 
confused 
so are many readers of a continental advertisement that appears 
to suggest the airline can get you to pittsburgh from manhattans 
penn station in 42 minutes says the better business bureau of 
metropolitan new york 
the bbb said friday that the ad is deceptive and should be 
discontinued 
but the airline defended the ad as being no more dishonest than 
ads featuring raisins that sing or cats that talk and said it would 
continue to appear in local newspapers 
advertising hyperbole is a wellestablished longstanding 
absolutely straightforward methodology to inform readers viewers 
listeners thats exactly what this ad does bruce hicks a 
continental spokesman said from the company headquarters in 
houston 
in a bold headline the ad promises penn station to 
pittsburgh 42 min 
following the headline in much smaller type the ad explains 
that 42 minutes is the average travel time from penn station to 
newark airport during rush hours 
the issue isnt pittsburgh hicks said its how close 
newark airport is to much of manhattan 
still the bbbs president barbara berger opotowsky is not 
mollified and said the ad creates a misconception to the reader 
and an impression with no basis in reality 
ms opotowsky said she has referred the matter to the state 
attorney general and new york citys department of consumer affairs 
so how long does it take to get to pittsburgh from penn station 
assuming that after 42 minutes travel time you arrive at the 
newark terminal 30 minutes before the 840 am flight the entire 
journey should take you 171 minutes

million or 73 cents a share a year earlier

bond prices rose in a technical rally friday to 
finish at the highs of the day 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond rose 1732 point or 
about 5 for every 1000 in face value its yield fell to 919 
percent from 925 percent late thursday 
analysts said the credit market sold off a bit in early trading 
but demand for bonds set in and prices climbed higher throughout 
the rest of the session 
we closed with a rally at the end noted william brachfeld 
an executive vice president at daiwa securities inc 
analysts said there was no strong reaction to a labor department 
report that consumer prices climbed a modest 03 percent in june 
the overall june increase which matched the rise for may would 
amount to an annual inflation rate of 42 percent if prices climbed 
at the same pace for 12 straight months 
robert brusca chief economist and senior vice president at 
nikko securities co international inc said the report was in 
line with expectations he also noted that declines in gasoline and 
clothing costs nearly offset a sharp increase in food prices which 
did not give traders a clear reason to believe inflation is on the 
rise 
a resurgence of inflation could prompt the federal reserve to 
tighten credit by nudging interest rates higher 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues finished 332 point higher intermediate 
maturities were point to 532 point higher and 20year issues 
were up 1732 point according to figures provided by telerate 
inc a business information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer was up 255 at 113772

foods inc and san diegobased bumble bee account for half of the 
1 billion retail canned tuna market in the united states

starkist and bumble bee plants on puerto rico that are separated 
by only a chainlink fence

the government on friday ordered state mines 
to sell their silver to the central bank and offered private miners 
more money for the metal in an effort to boost perus faltering 
economy 
agriculture minister remigio morales bermudez said the 
government may use the silver to build up a 750 million reserve to 
import food 
current silver sales contracts will be respected and private 
mine companies can still sell their silver abroad independently 
according to a decree published friday in the official gazette el 
peruano 
analysts said it was unclear if the government would negotiate 
new sales contracts with the silver it controls 
the decree said the silver is earmarked to boost perus foreign 
reserves which have declined dramatically 
a lack of dollar reserves to purchase imports needed for 
economic growth has sparked widespread shortages of basic consumer 
and industrial items and contributed to perus rocketing inflation 
estimated to reach 400 percent this year 
the action comes with the nations important mineral industry 
slowed due to an indefinite nationwide mining strike which began 
monday 
the strike and the government new silver measures have created 
uncertainty in international metal markets causing some commodity 
prices to fluctuate news reports said 
silver futures posted sharp gains on new yorks commodity 
exchange in reaction to the continuing miners strike in peru if 
the governments plan to buy the metal continues analysts said it 
would likely prove bullish for silver prices 
peru is the worlds second leading supplier of the metal behind 
mexico and a major source of copper lead zinc and gold 
private producers account for 58 percent of perus annual silver 
output estimated at 60 million ounces last year silver exports in 
1987 reached 300 million total mineral exports were 12 billion 
slightly less than half of all sales abroad 
the decree included an offer for private silver producers to 
sell their production to the state in contracts lasting up to three 
years 
both state and private silver producers would be paid 15 percent 
more for their output than the international silver price the 
decree said payment would be in local currency at a floating bank 
exchange rate the rate is slightly less that the free market 
exchange rate which was 202 intis to the dollar thursday 
the government currently requires private and state mining firms 
to exchange the dollars they receive from foreign mineral sales at 
a fixed exchange rate of 101 intis to the dollar 
despite the higher price offered in the decree industry 
analysts said it was unclear how private miners would react they 
said the government has frequently altered its exchange rates and 
if the floating bank rate were frozen perus high inflation could 
erode any gains the measure holds for mine companies 
the nations largest silver mines have continued to work despite 
the strike industry officials said but silver mining operations 
at centromin the largest stateowned silver producer have been 
cut by at least 50 percent according to company and federation 
officials 
the strike organizer the national federation of mine metal and 
steel workers which claims to represent 75 percent of the nations 
mine workers is demanding unified labor contracts among all 
unionized miners and quarterly cost of living salary increases the 
government has rejected the demands

most crop futures prices moved lower friday on the chicago board 
of trade in a lackluster session featuring profittaking and 
uncertainty about the farm belt weather outlook for the weekend and 
beyond 
on other markets silver futures were sharply higher livestock 
and meat were mostly higher energy futures were lower and 
stockindex futures retreated 
soybean prices for nearterm delivery fell for the fifth 
straight day bringing the august contract to just over 830 a 
bushel the lowest price for nearmonth delivery since june 2 
grain and soybean prices fell sharply earlier in the week as 
showers swept across the dusty midwest the market has been unable 
to sustain a rally since then because of speculation that the 
drought pattern that drove soybeans to a 15year high of nearly 11 
a bushel on june 23 has weakened analysts said 
the bulls are really grasping here trying to get things 
recovered said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago what we need to make prices rise is a 
return to hot dry weather 
forecasters generally expected temperatures in the midwest to 
turn warmer over the weekend but some also predicted scattered 
showers and traders were hesitant to establish new positions 
everybodys a little gunshy because the last time we were 
supposed to just get showers we got some good rains said john 
frazier grain specialist with balfour maclaine corp in chicago 
after the close the national weather service issued a 
6to10day forecast calling for hot and mostly dry conditions to 
prevail in the farm belt during the latter part of next week 
losses in the wheat market were limited by agriculture 
department reports of new export deals with china india and iraq 
analysts said 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in september at 384 a bushel corn was cent to 4 
cents lower with september at 312 a bushel oats were 9 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with september at 260 a bushel soybeans 
were 12 cents lower to 20 cents higher with august at 830 a 
bushel 
silver futures fell on new yorks commodity exchange 
the market reacted with skepticism to potentially bullish 
reports that the peruvian central bank planned to acquire all of 
the nations silver output accounting for 2035 percent of world 
production instead of allowing it to be sold on the international 
market 
if in fact they do hold it back for a long period of time 
its very bullish for silver said jack barbanel director of 
futures trading for gruntal amp co in new york 
but he said the information is really mixed on whether 
theyre going to hold it back and the market just cannot gauge 
what is going to be the final outcome of this 
gold settled unchanged to 20 cents higher with august at 44290 
a troy ounce silver was 131 cents to 148 cents lower with july 
at 7606 a troy ounce 
nearmonth pork futures advanced their permitted limits on the 
chicago mercantile exchange for the second consecutive session in 
response to strong cash markets and anticipation of a seasonal 
upswing in retail demand 
cattle futures advanced in cautious trading ahead of the usdas 
quarterly 13state and monthly 7state cattleonfeed reports 
the reports showed slightly more cattle being fattened for 
slaughter than the trade had expected and analysts pronounced it 
slightly bearish for nearterm contracts 
more startling was the usdas projected thirdquarter marketings 
figure of 62 million head which would make the number of cattle 
sold for slaughter during the current quarter the largest in us 
history said chuck levitt livestock analyst in chicago for 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
the usda also issued a monthly cold storage report showing 1047 
million pounds of frozen pork bellies in storage on june 30 a 220 
percent increase over a year ago and the thirdlargest june 30 
figure in history 
live cattle settled unchanged to 55 cent higher with august at 
6612 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 97 cent higher 
with august at 7737 cents a pound hogs were 42 cent lower to the 
limit 150 cents higher with ugust at 4612 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 145 cents lower to 2 cents higher with july at 
3975 cents a pound 
energy futures prices were slightly lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange after persian gulf developments cast a pall on 
early trading and technical factors brought the market back 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 16 cents 
lower with september at 1638 a barrel heating oil was 53 cent 
to 73 cent lower with august at 4495 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was unchanged to 18 cent lower with august at 5207 cents 
a gallon

exchange where the contract for september delivery of the standard
