only about 50 leatherclad motorcyclists and a 
few hundred other peaceable partyers zipped into zap on saturday 
for the anniversary of the zip to zap party that ended in a 
riot 20 years ago 
that makes my day i love people and i love things happening 
we do have it in order so i am not worried said mayor albert 
sailer said smiling and waving beneath his blue baseball cap 
which was emblazoned with the slogan i zipped to zap and had a 
blast 
this isnt anything like it was 20 years ago said mercer 
county sheriff ron kessler who was among the police who tried to 
quell the original riot it was a long evening then 
sailer had been told to expect 500 bikers for zip to zap ii 
which was originally planned as 12 hours of partying and rock music 
in one of north dakotas smaller towns 
in 1969 this quiet hamlet of 300 people about 90 miles 
northwest of bismarck hosted the first zip to zap an idea hatched 
by the editor of the student newspaper at north dakota state 
university 
it ended in disaster the national guard was called in to chase 
2000 drunken revelers out of town celebrants set a bonfire in 
main street and caused about 3000 in damage before the crowd was 
dispersed 
saturdays reunion started quietly but livened up as the sun 
went down people began dancing in the street to the blare of 
recorded music and zaps two bars were jammed kessler said the 
crowd swelled to more than 500 people 
thirty people had been arrested by late saturday night mostly 
for being too young to drink or for drinking on public property 
middleaged people and more than a few locals mingled with the 
student crowd 
the mood was festive far from a mob scene there were guest 
books for people to sign soda pop and hot dogs were for sale 
everywhere although beer was banned in the streets 
dj guerrero of fargo who attended the first zip to zap in 
1969 remembered that beer prices helped touch off the riot 
it was a mass of humanity out on the streets and everybody was 
having a good time a good time gone sour he said townspeople 
started jacking up the prices on beer and food and everything and 
kids got upset they doubled the price on sixpacks of beer 
guerrero 53 brought his wife and two children to zap for the 
reunionthey wanted to zip to zap so i said ok he said 
guerrero was also making amends for what happened in 1969 i 
apologized to the people here for what happened the national guard 
had to save the town there would have been nothing left here 
alda peterson transformed her garage just off main street into a 
minicafe complete with 9 souvenir tshirts zip to zap were 
back 
the reunion was a good idea the 64yearold woman said you 
have to let the kids do something and the older people are just as 
nosy 
her son called her from california friday night asking if she 
was ready for the zippers and envious that he could not be 
home mrs peterson said 
if everything is kept under control it would be nice to be an 
annual event she said 
but the denizens of zap are far from agreement on that idea 
some wanted the town barricaded saturday to keep the visitors out 
she said its a touchy question she said

china and the soviet union were brothers in 
communism but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years 
ago will not be a family reunion 
the chinese determined to show independence from their onetime 
tutor in revolution have forced the soviets to make the overtures 
and concessions toward normal relations 
when mikhail s gorbachev comes to beijing on may 15 it will be 
deng xiaoping the 84yearold chinese leader who plays big 
brother because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms 
the soviets are just beginning 
during the past year gorbachev pulled soviet troops out of 
afghanistan announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the 
chinese border and put pressure on the soviet ally vietnam to 
withdraw from cambodia after more than a decade of occupation 
vietnam has said it will do so by sept 30 
those actions met chinas three conditions for a summit with the 
soviet leader and moved closer to gorbachevs own goal of reducing 
international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems 
china agreed to the summit almost grudgingly 
when eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister 
announced the date during a visit to beijing in february the 
chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days 
later 
ties between the two nations in trade foreign policy and 
cultural exchange were close between 1950 and 1960 but chinese 
leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance 
the main immediate value of the summit for china which is wary 
of an expansionist vietnam has been the concessions on cambodia 
diplomatic sources said the chinese were trying to extract new 
pledges even in the final weeks before gorbachevs arrival 
vietnams withdrawal plan does not include a un peacekeeping 
force or establishment of an interim government to oversee 
elections china is said to want both endorsed in the summit 
communique 
moscow seeks a general statement of principles guiding the 
relationship like the shanghai communique signed by president 
richard m nixon on his 1972 visit to china 
its not obligatory to mention cambodia in the communique 
said vv duhin cultural counsellor at the soviet embassy this 
document is designed for many years and cambodia is a problem of 
this year and next year 
igor rogachev soviet deputy foreign minister slipped into 
beijing quietly in late april hoping to resolve the matter a 
western diplomat described it as a game of chicken 
animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long 
history from the 17th century to the early 20th china and russia 
contended for influence in the vast asian interior 
soviet agents helped organize the chinese communist party in 
1921 and gave it assistance but also tried to dictate strategy in 
a way that irked the revolutionaries especially mao tsetung 
josef stalin thought little of maos plan for revolution in the 
countryside the soviet dictator continued recognizing the 
nationalist chinese government even as maos peasant guerrilla army 
was sweeping to victory 
friction continued after the stalinmao alliance of 1950 the 
soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in 
northeastern china in return for military and technological aid 
embarrassing chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign 
control 
the split came in the early 1960s after the soviets refused to 
back china in its 1959 border conflict with india would not help 
recapture taiwan from the nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to 
help the chinese build a nuclear bomb 
a border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969 
pragmatism took precedence over ideology under deng and china 
resumed trade and other nonpolitical exchanges with the soviet 
union 
both gorbachev and deng like to be seen as international 
peacemakers and both have serious economic and political problems 
at home 
restless nationalist groups in the soviet union have been 
demanding autonomy or independence university students in beijing 
have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale 
deng already has done away with maos communes and shelved his 
theories of continuous class struggle 
by meeting gorbachev deng is addressing one of maos last 
remaining legacies the chinesesoviet estrangement that has 
affected the world political map for three decades

the mayors of dallas and fort worth easily 
won reelection saturday and san antonios former mayor regained 
her office by a commanding margin in elections in four texas cities 
the least predictable contest all day was in el paso where two 
city council members in the sixcandidate field will face each 
other in a runoff election 
the campaigns in all four cities failed to inspire much voter 
interest 
in dallas with all 299 precincts reporting mayor annette 
strauss had 60895 votes or 73 percent to 17002 or 20 percent 
for attorney peter lesser billy jack ludwig had 3510 ballots or 
4 percent and marvin crenshaw had 2658 or 3 percent 
mrs strauss backed by a huge campaign fund and polls showing 
widespread support had been expected to win a second twoyear term 
in the nations seventhlargest city her main opponent had been 
lesser who picked up some support from some minority groups that 
once backed the incumbent 
city secretary robert sloan said he expected 15 percent or less 
of the citys nearly 500000 registered voters to cast ballots 
in san antonio former mayor lila cockrell won by 45300 votes 
or 59 percent to 24107 or 31 percent for insurance executive 
carl mauthe they were trailed by five other candidates who had no 
more than 2 percent of the vote each 
ms cockrell who was mayor of san antonio from 1975 to 1981 
was supported by the man who replaced her henry cisneros a 
leading hispanic political figure cisneros beset by personal 
problems decided against running for a fifth term 
bexar county elections administrator marco a gomez predicted an 
18 percent voter turnout 
fort worth mayor bob bolen who faced no serious opposition in 
his bid for a fourth twoyear term won with 14292 votes or 89 
percent 
he was trailed by evelyn williams who had 1099 votes or 7 
percent and carlos j adams with 656 votes or 4 percent 
in el paso with all ballots counted city council member suzy 
azar had 16220 votes or 31 percent to 11930 votes or 23 
percent for mayor pro tem ed elsey the other four candidates did 
not receive significant votes 
azar and elsey will face off may 27 
mayor jonathan rogers was prevented by law from seeking a fifth 
twoyear term 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the san antonio ballot was the first one in 14 years that didnt 
include cisneros he was a city councilman for six years before 
becoming mayor in 1981 
beset by a troubled marriage and his sons ill health cisneros 
last fall said he wouldnt run again and accepted a job in the 
private sector 
cisneros briefly reconsidered his reelection decision in 
january after san antonio voters approved a transportation tax to 
pay for a domed stadium that he supported but he decided against 
running after ms cockrells supporters said they would stay behind 
her 
in the dallas race mrs strauss 65 raised 300000 compared 
with lessers 16000 but she spent more than 1 million to be 
elected two years ago when neither was an incumbent 
it certainly is a different campaign said lorlee bartos a 
campaign consultant for mrs strauss the races are much less 
expensive throughout the city its a different economy 
the shooting deaths of five dallas police officers in 1988 
clouded mrs strauss first term police blamed city leaders for 
not providing enough support to the force which was also beset by 
a congressional investigation into its officers use of deadly 
force minority leaders insist on increased citizens review of 
police 
a nonpartisan committee appointed by mrs strauss studied the 
citys racial problems and this spring recommended redistricting 
the city council there have never been more than three minority 
members on the 11member council though the 1990 census is 
expected to show that minorities make up more than half the city 
population 
fort worth dallas and san antonio have city manager governments 
in which the mayor plays a lesser often ceremonial role the el 
paso mayor has more power because there is not a city manager

japanese prime minister noboru 
takeshita ended his fivenation southeast asian tour sunday and 
headed back to japan to annoint a successor and restore his partys 
scandalridden image 
japans kyodo news service in a report from the philippine 
capital said takeshita hinted he would ask veteran politician 
masayoshi ito to accept the premiership despite his reluctance to 
take the post 
president corazon aquino and other senior filipino officials 
were on hand for a 10minute farewell ceremony at manila airport 
where takeshita received a 19gun salute before boarding the plane 
for tokyo there were no speeches 
takeshita went ahead with the visit despite his announcement 
april 25 that he would resign to take responsibility for a scandal 
in which the recruit co is accused of seeking to buy influence 
with political donations or stock transactions that yielded huge 
profits to politicians bureaucrats and others 
on monday takeshita is expected to meet with ito a former 
foreign minister japanese sources say ito is expected eventually 
to accept the appointment if certain conditions are met though 
these are unclear 
japans kyodo news service reported sunday that takeshita hinted 
to japanese reporters traveling with with him that he would ask ito 
to take the job 
kyodo said takeshita stopped short of mentioning ito by name but 
said it is quite natural for a respectable man to win the heart 
of the people 
the governing liberal democratic party has focused on ito as a 
successor because so many of the partys leaders are tainted by 
recruit donations or stock deals while ito as seen as basically 
clean 
but the 75yearold ito chairman of the partys policymaking 
executive council has cited his age and heart problems caused by 
diabetes as reasons for declining the nomination to be party 
president and thus prime minister 
during his trip takeshita also visited indonesia thailand 
malaysia and singapore all five countries he toured are members of 
the noncommunist association of southeast asian nations the major

government will refuse to negotiate with the soviet union on 
reducing shortrange nuclear missiles in europe even if the other 
15 members of nato agree to do so 
the sunday telegraph in a washingtondated story said prime 
minister margaret thatcher made her views known to president bush 
in diplomatic notes and telephone conversations last week 
her tough stance on the issue is proving the main obstacle in 
the bush administrations frantic search for a compromise after 
west germanys insistence that negotiations must take place as soon 
as possible the newspaper reported 
it said mrs thatcher called bush after failing to agree on a 
united nato policy at her meeting with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl on april 30 
at that meeting in west germany mrs thatcher failed to 
persuade kohl to abandon his quest for early talks with moscow on 
reducing the missiles the british leader argued that the 88 lance 
missiles should be modernized not removed and that their 
reduction or removal would put europe in greater danger of sudden 
nuclear war involving strategic nuclear missiles 
the sunday telegraph said britain and the united states want to 
update the lance because of soviet modernization of shortrange 
nuclear armory and soviet superiority in conventional and chemical 
weapons

tens of thousands of workers rallied in 
central athens and marched on parliament on sunday in a may day 
celebration that was delayed six days because of orthodox christian 
easter 
more than 300 turkish and kurdish refugees held their own 
demonstration and marched to the turkish embassy where they burned 
that countrys flag 
they were protesting the death of an 18yearold worker during 
violent unauthorized may day demonstrations in istanbul last week

chanted death to the fascist turkish regime from approaching 
the embassy 
there are about 700 turkish and kurdish political refugees 
living in athens the kurds belong to an outlawed movement that 
seeks the formation of an independent kurdish state in southeastern 
turkey 
the may day celebration organized by the general confederation 
of greek workers was the first unified workers gathering in more 
than four years 
on a day like this our various views ideological differences 
and political choices are put aside under the joint goal that 
brings workers together said lambros kanellopoulos the groups 
socialist president 
the confederation which represents most of greeces 35 million 
workers was bitterly divided after its progovernment socialist 
leadership pushed for support of an austerity policy in 1985 
support for the twoyear austerity policy imposed by the 
governing panhellenic socialist movement was opposed by radical 
socialist and communist labor leaders who split the confederation 
but working under a new more moderate leadership those 
differences have since been resolved 
the confederation issued a resolution sunday calling on the 
government for wage increases linked to the inflation rate and a 
reduction of the workweek from 375 hours to 35 inflation in 
greece was running at 14 percent at the end of 1988 the highest in

secretary of state james a baker iii is about 
to launch his first diplomatic venture on soviet soil with an 
appeal for superpower cooperation in central america and the middle 
east and a challenge to mikhail s gorbachev to make his new 
thinking a reality 
baker also will propose that the superpowers resume in june 
their work on a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear weapons by 
30to50 percent 
but his focus primarily will be on regional problems that a 
close aide on friday said were growing to frightening 
proportions 
baker will ask the soviets to join the untied states in backing 
direct negotiations between palestinians and israelis and to curb 
the 500 million in military aid moscow gave to nicaraguas marxist 
government last year 
baker who held his first meeting with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in march in vienna has never been to the 
soviet union in private or public life 
the trip to moscow also will be the first for robert m gates 
the deputy director of the central intelligence agency who will 
accompany baker along with officials of the pentagon the state 
department and the national security council 
one of the issues projected for discussion in moscow is a joint 
approach to terrorism baker hopes to persuade the soviets to end 
financial support to countries that sponsor terrorism a group of 
us experts is planning to go to moscow later in the spring for 
further talks 
baker set the tone for his trip in a speech thursday in 
washington in which he contrasted the new thinking that has 
marked the gorbachev era with the reality of both soviet 
capabilities and actions 
he said the soviets continue to pose a significant military 
threat to western interests and sought to minimize gorbachevs 
unilateral force reductions in eastern europe as still leaving the 
warsaw pact with a 2to1 edge in tanks and artillery 
baker also said it was too early to tell whether gorbachevs 
restructuring of the economy known as perestroika will succeed 
bakers schedule will give him high visibility besides meetings 
with shevardnadze on wednesday and thursday mornings and a twohour 
session with gorbachev thursday afternoon several public events 
are planned to enhance his knowledge of soviet affairs and get his 
views across to the soviet people 
these include an interview on soviet television meetings with 
soviet parliamentarians and jewish dissidents and an inspection of 
the us embassy in moscow that will revive allegations the soviets 
planted eavesdropping devices 
baker flies to helsinki on monday morning and relaxes there and 
meets with finnish officials until his departure for moscow on 
wednesday morning on his way home he will stop in brussels to 
brief western allies at nato headquarters 
this also will provide an opportunity to try to resolve a 
dispute with west germany over shortrange nuclear missiles 
chancellor helmut kohl is resisting us and british demands that 
the lances range be extended to more than 250 miles the german 
leader wants us negotiations with the soviets to reduce 
shortrange weapons on both sides 
president bush and baker have rejected the demands as a mistake 
but may be losing ground as other countries in the 16nation 
alliance tilt toward the west german position 
the us hope is to resolve the dispute before bush and baker 
attend a nato summit meeting in the belgian capital with the nato 
partners may 2930 
on another arms control front however the administration seeks 
a resumption of talks 
us officials said friday that baker would propose in moscow 
that negotiations to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons be 
reopened in geneva the week of june 18 and basically pick up where 
they left off last november when they were recessed 
but baker will not outline to the soviet union the position the 
united states intends to take on specific issues once the 
bargaining resumes said the officials who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity 
essentially we are looking for continuinity and keeping arms 
control on a fast track an official said 
the reagan administration had tentatively decided to resume the 
negotiations in midfebruary but bush after taking office in 
january ordered a delay for a review now complete of us arms 
control and weapons policies

the countrys largest black 
newspaper sunday welcomed a cabinet ministers proposal to include 
blacks in parliament saying the government has finally seen the 
light 
city press described a speech in parliament last week by 
constitutional development minister chris heunis as possibly the 
most significant policy statement ever by a senior government 
official 
heunis however made clear that the governing national party 
would oppose any system in which white interests could be overruled 
heunis outlining the national partys latest constitutional 
strategy said the black majority should have a role in the 
cabinet in parliament and in the election of a president he said 
the government might allow south africans to participate in 
political structures that transcend racial lines 
strange but true said a city press editorial the 
government has finally seen the light realizing the need to 
establish an authentic parliament that will represent all south 
african communities 
south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs parliament has chambers for asians and people of 
mixedrace but the constitution gives almost total power to the 
party that wins the most votes among the 5 million whites 
militant antiapartheid leaders committed to the concept of 
oneperson onevote have ignored heunis speech but mainstream 
white newspapers sunday joined city press in depicting it as a 
milestone 
the sunday times the countrys largestselling newspaper 
described the speech as a dramatic uturn and one of the most 
important policy shifts of the past decade 
the government has accepted that south africans be allowed to 
choose their own political and social groupings irrespective of 
race said the sunday times the stand contradicts south 
africas classical apartheid dogma which holds that all south 
africans must exercise their political and social rights through 
the group to which they belong 
rapport a progovernment afrikaans newspaper ran a frontpage 
banner headline saying now one parliament the accompanying 
article evoked the image of a united south africa where all 
white black brown and indian can be represented in one cabinet 
and one parliament 
john maclennon a political writer for the argus newspaper 
group said heunis speech suggested the national party would 
forsake the votes of farright whites during the campaign leading 
to general elections sept 6 he said the nationalists will adopt a 
proreform platform aimed at whites who favor change but not 
majority rule 
the farright conservative party said heunis plan would lead 
swiftly to black domination 
the antiapartheid democratic party which hopes to replace the 
conservatives as the largest white opposition faction in 
parliament called heunis speech promising but questioned whether 
the rhetoric could be converted into law 
city press also expressed caution saying blacks have been let 
down time and time again by people who make promises and never live 
up to them

nuclear power new technologies and a closer 
eye on the environment are emerging as key elements of what a 
senior energy department official says will be the first real 
national energy policy this country has ever had 
energy secretary james d watkins has told congress hell have 
an energy plan ready by next april although there are indications 
this target may be missed 
watkins and his chief deputy henson moore have appeared before 
several key industry groups recently to sketch in some of the key 
contours of what watkins says will be a common sense approach 
to putting america on a more solid energy foundation 
some of the main areas of emphasis will be familiar greater 
leeway for oil companies to explore on federal lands tax breaks 
for oil drillers decontrol of natural gas prices expansion of 
nuclear power and pursuit of basic research 
more novel will be the energy departments pursuit of what 
watkins calls technology transfer ensuring that energy 
research advances made in the departments national scientific 
laboratories are made available to industry and universities the 
labs main focus is on topsecret nuclear weapons programs but 
watkins said they have done extensive work in unclassified energy 
areas 
watkins also has said his energy strategy will be more 
comprehensive than anything produced during the reagan 
administration it will take into account for example the links 
between energy and the environment including acid rain and the 
global atmospheric warming trend caused mainly by burning of fossil 
fuels he said 
moore has billed the evolving strategy as a clear departure from 
past policies 
were going to fashion the first real national energy policy 
this country has ever had the former louisiana congressman said 
at his swearingin ceremony april 20 
the government has produced many energy policies in the past 
but moores remark seemed to reflect the fact that the reagan 
administrations policy suffered from criticism by 
environmentalists and a lack of interest by the general public 
you could ask 100 people if the country had an energy policy 
and 99 would say no donald hodel the energy secretary from 
198285 said in a telephone interview he said there was a policy 
but that it was not commonly recognized 
watkins an engineer by training and a career naval officer 
wants to broaden the scope of the governments energy involvement 
beyond the traditional issues of energy production price and 
supply watkins sees room for his department to help stimulate 
young peoples interest in science math and engineering areas of 
education that he says are vital to the nations energy future 
this is where the nuclear issue fits in watkins is a devoted 
supporter of commercial nuclear power and he is troubled at the 
depth of public distrust of this energy source which accounts for 
nearly onefifth of all electricity generation 
no orders for new nuclear plants have been placed in 11 years 
and none are expected for the rest of the century scores of plants 
have been cancelled in the past decade and nuclears share of 
energy production is projected to fall in the 1990s the reagan 
administration supported nuclear power but failed to revive it 
this has produced two results that watkins says threaten the 
nations longterm energy security a shrinking energy base and a 
deterioration of nuclear expertise 
this is part of watkins motivation for launching a publicity 
campaign against new york gov mario cuomos plan to tear down the 
shoreham nuclear plant on long island which earlier this month was 
cleared for startup by federal regulators 
because shoreham is the right energy source at the right time 
for the right place its operation should stand as a symbol of the 
promise and potential of nuclear power in america watkins said 
after the plant got its license 
cuomo wants to tear it down because of doubts about whether long 
islanders could safety evacuate in the event of an accident 
watkins has vowed to fight the dismantlement 
watkins is taking an analogous approach to the problem of a 
slumping oil industry whose prospects for longterm revival have 
been damaged by the exxon valdez oil spill as a result of that 
accident the biggest spill in us history industry hopes for 
expanding exploration on the north slope have diminished 
watkins has expressed alarm at the decline in us oil 
production since 1986 which has coincided with a rise in oil use 
and a resulting jump in oil imports 
besides making the country more reliable on oil from the middle 
east the domestic oil slump has weakened young peoples interest 
in learning the business he said watkins recently cited figures 
showing that between 1982 and 1987 the number of freshmen enrolled 
in petroleum engineering schools plunged from 3300 to 271 
let us at least be forward thinking enough to prepare 
americas young people to be part of the energy breakthroughs of 
the next century watkins said 
the technological advances that watkins thinks are most 
important include 
a clean coal method of burning the nations most abundant 
energy source in ways that provide more power with less pollution 
the department plans to spend 5 billion through 1992 on 
demonstration projects by private companies 
new designs for nuclear reactors to reduce their vulnerability 
to meltdowns or other serious accidents that have eroded public 
confidence in the industry numerous such passively safe 
designs are under development 
a superconducting super collider watkins says he will push for 
federal financing of the 59 billion physics installation in texas 
at which scientists plan to explore the fundamental components of 
matter and energy

this year its politics as unusual in jersey city an 
industrial waterfront city of 230000 that sits a stones throw 
from the statue of liberty on the western shore of new york harbor 
a record 10 candidates are running for mayor in tuesdays 
freeforall if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the 
vote the top two finishers will spend another month hurling 
epithets until a june 13 runoff 
the election is nonpartisan but a registered democrat likely 
will win since democrats have outnumbered republicans as long as 
anyone can remember today the ratio is 13to1 
the lineup of candidates includes the incumbent two former 
mayors four city councilmen a banker a police officer and an 
insurance broker 
decorum is not their best quality 
lofty promises of political reform are met with sarcasm often 
sparking hearty guffaws from voters and biting attacks abound 
among the candidates 
in campaign advertisements one candidate refers to his 
opponents as political hacks another says hes fighting the 
corrupt political machine 
based on each camps estimates more than 3 million will be 
spent to capture the 65000ayear job jersey citys mayor 
influences spending of about 400 millionplus in public funds and 
has final sayso on filling approximately 6500 city jobs 
just last tuesday a federal judge took note of the citys 
patronage system blasting incumbent mayor anthony cucci for 
running a spoils system that punished public employees who 
didnt support his 1985 election bid 
his attempts to persuade the court that a new breeze blew into 
city hall on july 1 1985 are unavailing us district 
judge harold a ackerman said he ruled that a police officer was 
illegally demoted for supporting thenmayor gerald mccann instead 
of cucci in 1985 
the air was fetid added ackerman it was sadly business 
as usual in jersey city 
battling the party machine and the oldtime political bosses has 
become the common theme of this years mayoral fight as the 
candidates go after an electorate changed by an influx of 
upperincome executives and minority groups 
it used to be that candidates only had to reach out to the 
italian and irish strongholds in the city 
but as the city changed so did politics it is estimated there 
are 15000 people from india 20000 filipinos and 10000 egyptians 
in the city although its unclear how many of those people are 
registered voters an estimated 20000 hispanic and 25000 black 
residents are registered to vote 
for the first time a black council president glenn cunningham 
is considered a serious mayoral contender 
the campaign has stirred all the emotions of a tight baseball 
pennent race which was at no time more apparent than on the rainy 
night of the citys first mayoral debate fourhundred screaming 
supporters crammed into a room at jersey city community college to 
hear nine of the candidates take potshots at each other 
mansheim said he sees cucci mccann cunningham and twoterm 
councilman thomas fricchione as the four most likely candidates to 
make it to the runoff election 
the others he said are running not to win the mayors seat 
but to win influence 
thats a major part of the reason for running for mayor 
mansheim said even if they dont have a chance theyll 
negotiate for jobs mostly its not winnertakeall in jersey city 
by a longshot

eastern airlines began advertising for mechanics 
sunday but machinists union officials said the ads were merely 
ploys to lure striking mechanics over the picket line 
all of it is for purely psychological reasons said jim 
lewis treasurer of machinists local 702 its the same stuff 
theyve been doing for years here see if we can beat them down 
 
eastern took out ads in newspapers in 10 cities sunday seeking 
mechanics to replace machinists union members who have been on 
strike since march 4 
the miamibased carrier was almost grounded when pilots honored 
picket lines and the airline filed for bankruptcy protection four 
days into the strike 
the airline started hiring new pilots in the strikes first 
month and had added 264 as of friday two pilots have already 
completed training the rest are still being trained the airline 
also has begin hiring and trining new flight attendants 
eastern spokesman robin matell said wages offered new mechanics 
will range from 10 to 18 an hour that is about what the company 
was paying the machinists when the union struck refusing wage cuts 
of more than a third for some members 
the newspaper ads say understand that given the current 
strike your assignment at eastern may require you to perform 
services or replace employees involved in a labor dispute but also 
understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for growth and 
success 
matell said the company expects many inquiries from experienced 
mechanics 
lewis said its unlikely eastern will be able to hire qualified 
mechanics because other major carriers who are hiring mechanics 
offer more stability and better wages 
they would get people who have been rejected by the other 
carriers he said 
lewis said handfuls of strikers have dribbled across the 
picket lines with the strike in its third month he said he didnt 
expect large numbers to go back because of easterns new offer 
he added that it takes up to two years to fully train a mechanic 
to work on jetliners eastern officials said they couldnt estimate 
how long it will take to train their new mechanics without knowing 
their experience 
the company plans to hire 500 nonunion mechanics in the next 
few months 
weve said we have to rebuild the airline and the unions 
flatout have said they will not come back for current 
management matell said i dont think it should come as a 
surprise 
under its rebuilding plan eastern wants 2500 mechanics the 
company had more than that when the machinists union which also 
represents ramp agents janitors and other ground workers walked 
out 
eastern must have bankruptcy court approval of its plan the 
court set a wednesday deadline for offers from interested buyers

a 19milelong oil slick was 
flowing down the rhine river toward the netherlands on sunday a 
government official said 
johannes winkel a state spokesman in duesseldorf said west 
german authorities issued an international pollution alert and 
notified dutch authorities that the spill was approaching their 
territory 
he said the spill apparently was caused by an unidentified ship 
discharging its diesel fuel waste on saturday night winkel did not 
know how much oil had spilled but he said the thin slick posed no 
danger to the environment 
it is illegal in west germany to pump waste into a river and 
ships are supposed to dump it into dockside containers

candidates for federal judge who belong to 
discriminatory clubs are finding lastminute resignations may not 
be enough to win over critics and save their chances for a seat on 
the bench 
resigning immediately prior to being appointed or knowing that 
one may be appointed is not adequate says sen howard m 
metzenbaum dohio it misses the point the concern is that the 
jurist is going to be considered openminded and fair 
the senate which makes the final decision on judicial 
confirmation thus far has not flatly ruled out approval of 
nominees who belong to discriminatory clubs but the pendulum 
appears headed that way 
in practice consideration of potentially controversial nominees 
sometimes simply grinds to a halt without formal public action 
one attorneys hopes for a seat on the bench fizzled in 1988 
when he waited until two weeks before his scheduled senate hearing 
to resign from virginias exclusive james river club and told a 
black group he never felt any kind of moral fire within my belly 
to go out and correct what is perceived to be wrong by some 
a 17yearveteran of the colorado supreme court saw his hopes 
die last year after he balked when lawmakers urged him to resign 
from a country club with no black members and specific restrictions 
on women he said he would not bow to political pressure to 
enhance my chances for confirmation 
the new concern about club memberships goes beyond the senate 
the american bar association last week took steps to revise its 
rules and ban judges from being members of clubs that invidiously 
discriminate it could be the groups official policy by february 
1990 
no one is challenging the right of private clubs to 
discriminate as long as they are truly private and not merely 
wearing that label as a means of dodging the public accommodations 
laws 
the question is how much membership in such a club should weigh 
as lawmakers consider attorneys for lifetime appointments to the 
bench and whether judges who belong to clubs that discriminate can 
ever project an image of fairness 
metzenbaum says he could support a member of a discriminatory 
club for judge if the candidate had consistently worked to change 
such policies but he scoffs at lastminute resignations merely to 
appease the judiciary committee 
sen alan simpson rwyo another judiciary committee member 
says however that membership in such a club shouldnt be the 
sole and only reason for knocking the guy down if hes extremely 
well qualified 
it should not be used in the most extraordinary or absurd ways 
that its used sometimes in the judiciary committee he says 
if you like the guys philosophy and you think hes great you 
dont care what the heck he belongs to 
simpson says the club issue has not been applied evenly and 
cites a pending dispute about the nomination of san francisco 
attorney vaughn walker for a district court judgeship in that city 
walker nominated by former president reagan stoutly defended 
san franciscos 128yearold olympic club last year and failed to 
win approval from the committee the club had a handful of black 
members and bylaw provisions that bar women 
walkers nomination was submitted again by president bush and 
walker resigned from the club in february 
simpson notes that supreme court justice anthony kennedy was a 
member of the same club and resigned a month before his 1987 
hearing before the committee he says the panel was tolerant of 
kennedys belated resignation because he was exceptionally well 
qualified 
as for walker simpson says theyre still ramming it to him 
the whole transgression of his entire life is that he was a 
member of this same sinister club says simpson i think thats 
stupid 
meanwhile sen alan cranston dcalif is protesting walkers 
defense of the club in testimony last year 
i have reached the conclusion that his actions with respect to 
his membership in a discriminatory club are disqualifying 
cranston said in an april 4 letter to judiciary committee chairman 
joseph biden ddel cranston said walker should not be confirmed 
walker nominated at the urging of sen pete wilson rcalif 
declined to return repeated telephone calls to his office and home 
walkers critics however say they see a sharp difference 
between the case of kennedy and that of walker they note that 
kennedy resigned from another club in 1980 after advising it of his 
concern about its discriminatory policies 
and they cite his answer before the judiciary committee when 
asked why it took him so long to leave the olympic club 
he said that over the years he had tried to become more 
sensitive to the existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of 
women and of minorities in society and this was an issue on which 
i was continuing to educate myself

defense secretary dick cheneys costcutting 
move to scrap the v22 osprey aircraft includes a plan to replace 
it with the super stallion a problemplagued helicopter under 
investigation for possible design flaws 
a congressional firestorm over scrapping the osprey can only be 
fueled by cheneys turn toward the sikorsky aircraft ch53e super 
stallion the western worlds largest helicopter lawmakers say 
the osprey is designed to take off like a helicopter and fly 
like an airplane the marine corps wants it for surprise 
longrange amphibious assaults the government has invested 2 
billion in its development 
cheney however says that the osprey must go as part of his 
move to cut 10 billion in spending under the budget agreement 
between congress and the bush administration 
the navy rebuffed congressional demands in 1987 for grounding 
the super stallion and instead ordered sikorsky to conduct a 9 
million review to determine if a design flaw triggered seven 
crashes between june 1984 and january 1987 that left 20 marines 
dead 
that review due last summer but delayed by additional navy 
requests was delivered to the pentagon in early february with the 
company declaring the helicopter safe 
dissatisfied pentagon officials sent it back to the company last 
month for further tests according to bill armstrong spokesman for 
the naval air systems command 
we felt there were some areas of the tep test and evaluation 
program that had to be amplified armstrong said 
sikorsky says it will resubmit the review this summer the 
pentagon does not expect a final determination on the study until 
october which means debate over super stallion and osprey funding 
for fiscal 1990 will rage on without the benefit of the 
helicopters safety report 
some super stallion critics are ready to fight cheneys plan to 
buy more of the helicopters in the absence of a pentagonapproved 
sikorsky review 
until they can answer the question and do the review we 
need to put this on hold said rep jim bates dcalif a former 
marine and a leading critic of the super stallion 
but cheneys request for more super stallions which would 
revive a program that was scheduled to end in the 1990 budget 
indicates pentagon confidence in the helicopter sikorsky officials 
maintain 
theyre anticipating that the good name of the helicopter will 
be gotten back as the results of the testing show said ken 
kelly a sikorsky vice president in charge of the super stallion 
program in a way they have built in an anticipatory approval by 
navair of the work that has been done 
under the reagan administrations budget the super stallion 
program was to have ended in the 1990 budget year with just three 
more helicopters ordered 
but to compensate for the planned elimination of the new 
ospreys cheney wants to buy 23 super stallions for 1990 and is 
expected to ask for 23 annually in each subsequent year well into 
the 1990s according to congressional and industry sources the 
super stallions cost about 16 million each 
although the tiltrotor osprey could take off like a helicopter 
and fly like a plane military strategists believe the super 
stallion can handle much of the ospreys heavylift mission for the 
marines and navy 
the super stallion is a modified version of the vietnam era 
ch53d sea stallion the super stallion with its larger rotors and 
a third engine can lift up to 18 tons about double the old sea 
stallions capacity 
but critics say the 16ton helicopter is simply too big and 
should have been designed from scratch not modified from the 
smaller sea stallion 
it was designed too large and theres no way you can make it 
safe because of its size said bates

they thought they were getting free 
sneakers but 69 criminal suspects got snookered instead when they 
showed up at a phony shoe store for people on the run and were 
arrested on outstanding warrants 
i knew this was too good to be true one suspect exclaimed 
as he was handcuffed by sheriffs deputies during the twoday sting 
operation ive never won anything 
the lancaster county sheriffs office masquerading as an 
athletic footwear business mailed 500 letters to people with 
outstanding arrest warrants offering a free pair of athletic shoes 
just for filling out a survey 
the suspects were invited to show up at the new grabar athletic 
footwear store a new concept in shoe stores for people on the 
run 
the name was a takeoff on gray bar hotel a slang term for jail 
by 8 pm saturday little was left of grabar a small sign on 
the door read grabar shoes closed well catch you next time 
lancaster county sheriff ron tussing said human nature helped 
net 69 suspects on 96 active arrest warrants friday and saturday 
i think when you appeal to peoples greed i think thats why 
it was successful tussing said everybody wants to get 
something for nothing 
the warrants were for offenses ranging from traffic infractions 
to burglary assault drug possession and theft the majority were 
for minor offenses 
after being taken to jail suspects were required to post a bond 
or pay whatever fines or costs they owed one man arrested for back 
child support had to pay 3000 
of the 500 letters mailed about 120 were returned because of 
incorrect or outdated addresses tussing said in similar 
operations around the country a 10 percent arrest rate has been 
considered successful he said 
three people who were arrested on outstanding warrants also were 
arrested for marijuana possession at the store and one person 
was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon brass knuckles 
some of these people have not committed real serious crimes 
but they havent lived up to their responsibilities to pay fines or 
whatever tussing said it sends the message that were not 
going to ignore this stuff

student leaders at beijing university said sunday 
they will continue to boycott classes for at least five more days 
and may hold more marches through the city to press their demands 
for democratic reforms 
late sunday about 50 students marched around the university 
campus chanting continue the strike continue the strike the 
cry soon was picked up by classmates shouting from dormitory 
windows 
students at other universities in beijing that participated in 
the class boycott have decided to return to class after staging 
several mass demonstrations that brought tens of thousands of 
people onto the streets 
but the independent student union at beijing university the 
nations most prestigious school decided at a meeting sunday night 
to continue the boycott through friday we are the only ones 
keeping the flame said one student leader the boycott began 
april 24 
the group listed as conditions for returning to class government 
recognition of new student unions that have organized the fledgling 
prodemocracy movement reinstatement of a recently fired liberal 
shanghai newspaper editor changing city laws that restrict 
demonstrations and an apology from the official peoples daily 
newspaper for distorted reporting of the student movement 
if the government fails to meet the conditions or refuses to 
hold a dialogue with prodemocracy students further protest 
marches may be called beijing university student activists said 
one new poster at the university suggested daily sitins at 
tiananmen square the symbolic center of china 
all of china watches beijing all of beijing watches beijing 
university another poster said 
the largest protests in communist chinas 40year history in 
which tens of thousands of students and workers marched through 
beijing and occupied tiananmen square have resulted in 
conciliatory statements from the nations leaders and political 
debate that would have been unimaginable just one month earlier 
but leading student activists seem unsure of what to do next to 
keep up the movements momentum 
although communist party leader zhao ziyang on thursday called 
for talks with students chinas leadership has refused to talk 
with the independent student unions 
a new group of prodemocracy students was set up last week to 
initiate talks with the government it sent a written appeal to 
party and government leaders who promised to reply monday 
xiang xiaoji a leader of the student dialogue representative 
group said sunday the group wanted to raise some constructive 
proposals for the future building of democracy and the legal 
system 
issues he named for discussion included education family 
planning and price reform but he did not mention establishing a 
free press and fighting corruption major demands of the democracy 
movement 
we dont set ourselves up as the governments opponent 
xiang said our government is the peoples government and we are 
citizens

congress work on a 12 trillion federal 
budget for next year is sliding ahead smoothly but lawmakers now 
face a series of prickly decisions on taxes spending and of 
course politics 
the house and senate each signed off on a pair of spending plans 
thursday no surprise there the documents reflected deals honed 
last month between bush administration officials and congressional 
leaders and the chambers votes were little more than exercises in 
rubber stamping 
negotiators from the two houses plan to meet this week to work 
out a compromise budget that job too is expected to be 
sweatfree because the two measures differ only slightly in how 
they would distribute money among science housing and other 
domestic programs 
there are three major landmarks lying ahead however where 
jolting crunches could occur 
first up is additional revenues which are supposed to account 
for about half of the 28 billion in deficit reduction in the 
package 
the budget says 53 billion is to come from increased tax 
receipts president bush has claimed the budget allows him to honor 
his campaign mantra of no new taxes but strictly speaking that 
has yet to be decided 
bush says 48 billion of the amount can be raised by lowering 
the capital gains tax his argument it that such a cut will spark 
the economy and thus boost the governments overall tax take 
democrats largely oppose bushs idea calling it a boon for the 
wealthy ominously chairman dan rostenkowski dill of the house 
ways and means committee which writes tax legislation calls the 
plan unpalatable 
the result gridlock 
where are they going to deliver from asks peter j davis 
vice president of prudentialbache securities who monitors budget 
activity 
an additional 57 billion is supposed to come from sales of 
government assets and 27 billion more is slated to be raised by 
increasing fees for certain federal services congress has rejected 
some of these before and could do so again 
the second hurdle is the question of fiscal 1991 it doesnt 
begin until oct 1 1990 but lawmakers and bush have promised to 
try to complete a budget pact for that year over the next few 
months an early deal gives bush a feather in his cap and helps 
legislators avoid imposing pain in the form of any resulting 
taxes or spending cuts on their constituents during an election 
year 
this may not be easy the grammrudman deficitreduction law 
requires a 1991 shortfall of no more than 64 billion formidable 
considering this years red ink should reach about 160 billion 
many lawmakers say slashes of that magnitude will require lots 
of give on both sides an acceptance of taxes by bush and of 
domestic program cuts by democrats 
opinions vary on whether that will occur or whether the result 
will be a conglomeration of bookkeeping tricks onetime windfalls 
like asset sales and heavy reliance on rosy economic projections 
that make the deficit look smaller 
next year senators on both sides of the aisle will be 
demanding more deficit reduction than we had this year predicts 
sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
i dont know how we get around it next year but mark my 
words we will counters sen j bennett johnston dla a 
member of the budget panel 
hurdle no 3 comes aug 15 when the white houses office of 
management and budget is required to update its projection of the 
coming years deficit with fresh economic figures under the 
grammrudman law should omb determine that the shortfall will 
exceed the 1990 target of 110 billion a process begins that could 
result in sweeping politically unpalatable spending cuts 
most budgetwatchers doubt omb would upset things by deciding 
that things are off course 
the general assumption is that when the administration and 
congress came up with their agreement implicit was that omb 
wouldnt change the numbers very much in august says stanley 
collender who watches budget action for the price waterhouse 
accounting firm

hours after last months slaying of 
an american colonel president corazon aquino was asked her 
reaction to the killing she said us security must have been 
inadequate 
a few days later mrs aquino told reporters she expected that 
preliminary talks on a new treaty on us military bases one of 
the countrys most divisive issues will begin this year 
foreign secretary raul manglapus clearly caught by surprise at 
an apparent policy reversal issued his own statement insisting the 
government still has not decided whether to allow the bases to 
remain after their lease expires in 1991 
the two statements are examples of mrs aquinos tendency to 
make offthecuff public statements which appear overly simplistic 
and display a lack of skill in communicating policy 
its amazing how president aquino is now often caught blurting 
out things that other statesmen would hesitate to say under the 
same circumstances said federico pascual editor in chief of the 
independent philippine daily inquirer 
we dont know if these were remarks made for calculated effect 
or were lapses whose implications were not immediately clear to the 
president he added 
often mrs aquinos answers to reporters questions on 
important national issues appear aimed at dodging responsibility 
and display a strangely detached view of events 
after communist rebels killed us army col james nick rowe 
on april 21 mrs aquino said american officials here had been 
stepping up security but that the measures obviously were 
insufficient 
protection of american and other foreign officials is the 
responsibility of the philippine government 
only later when she visited the us embassy for a memorial 
service did she express grief at the death of an officer assigned 
to assist her own armed forces 
during a recent conversation with reporters mrs aquino was 
asked to comment on reports from a leftwing west german 
publication that us ambassador nicholas platt was a cia operative 
instead of dismissing the claim mrs aquino suggested the state 
department should comment publicly on the charge that appeared to 
give credence to the allegation made by former cia operative 
philip agee and served to keep the charge on the front pages of 
manila newspapers for two more days 
eventually mrs aquino said she was satisfied with platts 
denial of the charge 
mrs aquinos media problems are based in part on an inefficient 
system of access and a haphazard formula for obtaining the 
presidents views and comments 
press secretary teodoro benigno resigned last month effective 
may 16 and no successor has been named benigno was the fourth 
presidential press secretary since mrs aquino took office three 
years ago his tenure was marked by frequent battles with the press 
over the issue of presidential access 
for months reporters access was limited largely to ambush 
interviews where journalists would gather at the entrance to her 
office and bark a few questions as she arrived or left 
that was replaced by a system in which reporters would submit 
daily written questions a few hours later reporters received 
terse written replies ostensibly from the president 
the presidential staff has recently revived the weekly mini 
press conference in which a few filipino reporters meet with the 
president reporters from foreign news organizations are excluded

starting with a fortuitous opportunity to 
invest in a gas well in 1979 house speaker jim wright staked much 
of his financial future on oil and gas investments 
he usually made money received a sweetheart deal or two and 
occasionally was bailed out of financial jams by friends and 
associates but the transactions never made wright rich 
and at least one major nonenergy investment turned into a 
substantial loss for the future house speaker whose financial 
climb began only after years spent in debt

committed 69 rules violations in his private business transactions

by chance family members told the ethics committee the oilmen 
began discussing whether to invest in an east texas gas well 
family patriarch and oil lobbyist monty moncrief and his son tex 
had little interest in the relatively small investment but texs 
son richard suggested that his grandfather make the deal for some 
of the other grandchildren 
richard and monty moncrief turned to wright and asked if he 
wanted to take a little interest in this deal the thenhouse 
majority leader accepted later investing 19788 
before that day wright had assets of between 72000 and 
170000 mostly the value of his fort worth home according to 
his 1978 financial disclosure form the report requires listings of 
income and assets only in broad ranges 
from then forward his finances improved but it was a roller 
coaster ride up one year down the next according to a record 
pieced together from his own congressionally required disclosure 
statements the report of the ethics committees special counsel 
richard j phelan and published material 
wright profited from interests in oil and gas wells a handsome 
return on two oil stocks sold by his halfowned investment company 
mallightco and mallightco gemstone and real estate investments 
but he lost most of 100000 he had borrowed to invest in a 
nursing home company that later filed for bankruptcy protection 
even though he got back at least 22000 in dividends that other 
shareholders were unsuccessful in obtaining according to published 
reports 
wrights most profitable deal was in 1988 just before he sold 
his half of mallightco to his partner george mallick by that time 
wrights share was part of a blind trust he created in 1987 he 
directed the trustee to sell his share to recoup enough money to 
pay off the nursing home loan 
mallick meanwhile was looking for a last bet the farm 
investment it turned up with the purchase and sameday resale of 
an interest in an prospective oil and gas well mallightco bought 
the well for 9120 in cash and sold it for a 340000 profit the 
well turned up dry 
the ethics committee is still investigating that pair of 
transactions even as it plans for hearings on the 69 unrelated 
allegations that wright circumvented house income limits and 
accepted improper gifts from mallick 
according to his disclosure statements wrights income was 
between 85703 and 101700 in 1979 it climbed to between 
192560 and 326550 in 1983 the year he sold his fort worth 
home and peaked at 358764 to 736758 in 1986 when he earned 
significant oil and gas revenue and profited from a cable 
television stock sale in 1987 it fell to between 169185 and 
177682 
wright listed the value of his holdings in 1983 the peak year 
at between 415015 and 1075000 half the total was attributed 
to investments in oil and gas wells and the value of his fort worth 
home 
by 1987 when the holdings went into the blind trust his listed 
assets dropped to a range of between 155000 and 435000 part of 
the difference can be attributed to the way speaker filled out his 
disclosure forms 
wright sold his fort worth home valued at between 100001 and 
250000 in august 1983 and purchased a more expensive home in 
mclean va which last year was appraised at more than 352000 
according to the wall street journal 
the texas democrats fort worth home was listed as an asset in 
accordance with the rules because it produced rental income the 
mclean home apparently had no rental income and was not listed as 
part of wrights holdings 
another possible contributor for the drop in assets was wrights 
disastrous 1983 investment in jewell enterprises of arlington 
texas a nursing home venture 
whether or not wright received favored treatment through 
dividend payments as other jewell stockholders told the new york 
times last week his investment became worthless when the company 
filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 and later began liquidation

wright often had to borrow money to make his investments often 
he also relied on friends and business associates to bail him out 
his first gas well investment in 1979 with the moncriefs is an 
example 
in 1983 both demand and prices for natural gas had declined 
and no gas was being extracted from the moncrief well 
by december of that year wright owed a bank 20600 in 
principal and interest on the loan that financed his investment in 
the venture a month later the nowdeceased oilman monty moncrief 
bought back wrights interest in well for 20000 and the speaker 
used the money to pay off his loan 
over the 4year investment wright paid more than 30000 in 
drilling and monthly operating costs but earned 39353 20000 
coming from the moncrief bailout 
wright also had purchased from moncrief interest in a second 
east texas well known to contain substantial quantities of natural 
gas donald hockaday an independent oil and gas consultant told 
the ethics committee that deal posed no risk for wright 
i would be prone to think it was a sweetheart agreement 
hockaday testified you know i would love to have a chance to do 
that every day 
wright paid 50000 for his interest 35000 of it from a bank 
loan but hockaday calculated the value of wrights interest at 
132000 to 140000 because it was clear the well would produce 
gas 
wright held onto the well at least through late 1988 paying a 
total of 56475 in drilling and monthly operation costs and 
receiving income of 74480 from the venture according to the 
ethics committees counsel 
it was in 1980 that wright and his partner mallick formed 
mallightco the company enjoyed early success through transactions 
in oil stocks 
an investment in delhi oil netted 83000 in profits in five 
months buying and selling supron energy corp stock resulted in a 
27500 profit over 14 months according to the ethics panels 
counsel 
in addition a 40000 investment in gemstones brought in 
distributions of 62950 a profit of 41182 was made on a florida 
real estate deal 
but mallightco lost money on other stock deals 6314 in one 
case 1115 in another and 700 in a third instance 
wright his wife mallick and his wife often had to borrow to 
make mallightco investments sometimes borrowing from mallightco 
itself by the end of 1981 wright and his wife betty owed their 
company nearly 120000 
by 1984 the wrights were no longer meeting the interest 
payments on their debt owed mallightco 
the company never demanded payment from the wrights or took 
any steps to collect the debt phelans report said

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher on sunday said western allies must not let a feud over 
europes shortrange nuclear missiles become the central issue of 
the nato alliance 
genscher also reiterated west germanys demand that the 
superpowers begin talks soon on reducing the shortrange missiles 
washington and britain oppose the talks 
west germany also wants nato to delay until 1992 a decision on 
whether to modernize shortrange lance missiles based in west 
germany 
but in an apparent effort to tone down the dispute that has 
split the alliance he said said the disagreement should not become 
a dominant issue 
genscher in a speech in stuttgart to mark the beginning of 
germanamerican friendship week said it would be out of all 
proportion if the question of whether to decide upon a new weapons 
system is made into the central issue of the alliance 
a copy of genschers speech was released in bonn 
the united states oppposes any negotiations on grounds that nato 
needs the missiles to compensate for the overwhelming superiority 
of warsaw pact conventional forces it also says the lance rockets 
soon will be obsolete and must be modernized to travel greater 
distances 
most of natos shortrange nuclear missiles are based in west 
germany chancellor helmut kohls government is losing support in 
public opinion polls and kohl fears a decision to deploy new 
missiles could cost him the next federal election in december 1990 
referring to a wave of reforms in the soviet bloc genscher said 
the western alliance should use the historical opportunity to 
forge new eastwest relations 
us ambassador vernon a walters speaking at the same ceremony 
in stuttgart warned nato against overestimating the significance 
of political changes in eastern europe

a card game in deadwood got wild bill 
hickok killed but things have quieted down since the legendary 
lawman was gunned down during a hand of poker in the frontier 
towns shootem up days 
true blackjack and poker are on their way back but the new 
dealers of deadwood are taking a collegesponsored course to learn 
how to lay out the cards and the newly legalized gambling will be 
deliberately a lowstakes affair 
i grew up in deadwood this is like going back in time and 
reliving a part of deadwoods past says lori keehn struble 23 
whose family owns the saloon where hickok died in 1876 holding his 
legendary dead mans hand of aces and eights 
struble is enrolled in a course that is training blackjack 
dealers for the historic black hills towns new gambling halls she 
plans to work as a dealer in the familys no 10 saloon 
theres a lot to learn struble says theres so much 
concentration involved 
voters statewide authorized limited gambling in deadwood last 
november only blackjack poker and slot machines are allowed and 
bets may not exceed 5 members of the south dakota gaming 
commission appointed last month said gambling could start late 
this summer 
the blackjack dealers course which began last week is offered 
through western south dakota vocational technical institute 
twentyeight students are enrolled in the first session 
gary whiteaker coordinator of adult business and industry 
training said educators consulted with community colleges in 
nevada to design the course 
you dont go out and find a blackjack dealing curriculum on 
the shelf he said 
william thornhill a former dealersschool owner with 10 years 
experience dealing in las vegas teaches the course he says 
deadwoods focus on lowkey gambling and games of skill should lead 
to success for the town of 2000 and its players 
gaming commission chairman chuck lien of rapid city said the 
panel must hire a staff write rules to control gambling and devise 
a security system to prevent corruption lien said the commission 
has requested copies of gaming rules from nevada new jersey and 
other states where limited gambling is allowed 
the citys share of gambling revenue will go toward historic 
preservation and locals say they want to keep the oldtime western 
atmosphere in and the glitz out of this gambling center 
the fact that weve limited the bets to five dollars is going 
to be less intimidating to people said bill walsh a gambling 
supporter and owner of the franklin hotel you cant have a sign 
that says casino traditionally we called them poker rooms and 
gambling halls therell be no blinking neon lights in deadwood 
there are very few towns in the united states that have that 
western mystique he said 
as lien put it well never be a las vegas or an atlantic 
city 
walsh said operators of large casinos are watching deadwood with 
interest to see how the gambling venture fares 
if we just imitate our past well be successful he said 
if we become more than that sort of a western disneyland of 
gambling therell be a lot of outside investors looking at us 
theres that big question mark out there right now we just dont 
know

pen is expected to admit a new 
soviet chapter this week in a move that would open the 
international writers group to artists from the soviet union for 
the first time in 65 years 
alexandre blokh pens international secretary said in an 
interview on sunday that he expects the organizations 53rd 
international conference to admit the soviet chapter in a vote 
wednesday 
theyre certainly welcome and i think there will be no 
difficulty blokh said of the soviet chapter which was formed 
last year 
the pen conference a gathering of 300 novelists poets 
playwrights and other literary figures opens in maastricht on 
monday 
those attending will represent the 10000 members of pen or 
poets playwrights editors essayists and novelists a 
londonbased group with about 60 chapters in its member nations 
in 1924 pen turned down the soviet unions request to join the 
group and since then the writers group has consistently opposed 
soviet membership because of the nations persecution of writers 
and intellectuals 
the first official act of the new soviet pen chapter was to 
condemn the death threat ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran issued 
against british author salman rushdie according to the soviet 
newspaper literaturnaya gazeta 
if the soviet chapter is approved its members will have to sign 
the pen charter which condemns censorship and says free 
criticism of governments administrations and institutions is 
imperative 
the newspaper said members of the soviet chapter include poets 
yevgeny yevtushenko and andrei voznesensky novelists anatoly 
rybakov and chengiz aitmatov historian dmitri likhachev and 
playwright mikhail shatrov 
the approval of the soviet chapter would be a significant 
breakthrough for soviet writers who were isolated from many 
international cultural groups until their nations intellectual 
climate began to improve recently 
it would also be the latest indication that western 
organizations approve of president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
glasnost or greater openness in soviet cultural and 
intellectual affairs 
one obstacle to soviet membership has been the large number of 
languages used in the country blokh said because pen chapters are 
usually open to only one language group the soviets would be 
entitled to dozens of chapters and therefore be able to exert a 
disproportionate amount of influence he said 
under a compromise hammered out by the pen leadership in moscow 
last month the soviets would be allowed to open a maximum of five 
chapters said blokh 
andrei bitov a novelist heading the sixman delegation of 
soviet observers at the conference told the associated press that 
soviet pen membership would be only one of the smaller changes 
made possible by gorbachev 
this organization was understood to be by those in power as 
reactionary and antisoviet he said 
even now a lot of soviet writers regard this only as an 
organization of prestige not as an organization which will 
struggle against censorship and for the human rights of a 
writer said bitov who himslef faced a sixyear publication ban 
from 197985

soviet military authorities may seek the 
extradition of a soviet hockey star on charges he deserted the red 
army when he defected to the united states a moscow newspaper said 
sunday 
lt alexander mogilny disappeared thursday in stockholm sweden 
after helping the soviet national team win the world hockey 
championships 
the 20yearold forward considered one of the countrys best 
prospects arrived in the united states a day later on an airline 
ticket paid for by the buffalo sabres the national hockey league 
club that had chosen him in last years player draft 
his story was recounted sunday in the newspaper sovietsky sport 
under the headline the golden calf and the horsethieves from 
buffalo 
like many soviet athletes mogilny is a junior officer in the 
red army and the newspaper quoted a moscow prosecutor as saying 
the hockey star is now under investigation for desertion 
if the crime is confirmed i think we will ask for extradition 
of the officer said col leonid obyektov prosecutor for the 
moscow garrison 
evasion of military service and desertion is considered to be 
a grave crime in all countries obyektov said to study all the 
details of this affair we will request through the ministry of 
foreign affairs legal assistance of the appropriate us 
organizations 
the investigation will include the interrogation of mogilny 
and any other searches for facts which might be required the 
prosecutor said 
the united states does not have an extradition agreement with 
the soviet union according to an embassy spokesman in moscow 
speaking on condition of anonymity he noted there have been a 
lot of defectors and im sure many could have been charged with a 
violation of some soviet law 
the sovietsky sport article was one of many in soviet newspapers 
that strongly criticized mogilny a member of the central red army 
team for succumbing to the lure of capitalist cash 
the defense ministry newspaper red star complained that the 
runaway had been spoiled in the soviet union with everything he 
wanted having consumed everything the soviet economy could 
provide thoughts of the forward stretched beyond the ocean where 
carrots are sweeter and pay is larger the newspaper said 
but another star soviet hockey player anatoly firsov said such 
a defection should have been expected because of a longsimmering 
dispute between national team members who want to play for the west 
and a resisting coach viktor tikhonov 
the situation on the team is explosive and something like 
that had to happen said firsov a newly elected member of the 
soviet parliament 
soviet sports authorities were due to discuss the signing of 
several hockey players with the nhl after the teams return from 
stockholm 
moscow in general has become increasingly receptive to overtures 
from us professional sports leagues interested in acquiring 
soviet players

presidential campaigns wind up 
this week much as they began carlos menem of the peronist party 
leads in the polls and eduardo angeloz is plagued by his governing 
partys economic failures 
three fringe candidates have staked out issues further to the 
right and left but were expected to receive only 11 percent of the 
ballots on may 14 argentines were also to vote for onehalf the 
chamber of deputies as well as state legislators in 16 of the 22 
provinces 
angeloz could win but his deficit is very big if you ask me 
it isnt very likely said pollster manuel mora y araujo his 
survey two weeks ago gave the radical civic union candidate 29 
percent of the vote with 34 percent going to menem and 21 percent 
to undecideds 
polls published april 30 in the capitals two largest 
circulation dailies clarin and la nacion gave menem a 10point 
edge 36 percent to 26 percent for angeloz but one in four voters 
was undecided 
the main issue is the economy which has declined for the past 
four decades but plunged this year argentinas currency the 
austral has been devalued by about 80 percent since february 
igniting 35 percent monthly inflation 
wages have not kept pace business is in disarray and basic 
goods like medicine milk and spare parts for industry are in short 
supply or sold at several times the price of two months ago 
todays images of argentina are empty shelves at pharmacies 
long lines at foreign exchange houses a central bank out of paper 
to print money doctors and teachers and mail carriers on strike a 
poor housewife buying eggs and apples for her family one at a time 
i was better off five years ago than i am now said gustavo 
battiato a 31yearold repairman for the state telephone company 
i voted for president raul alfonsin i wont vote for angeloz 
angeloz a 57yearold provincial governor hasnt thrown in the 
towel at rallies last week he attracted large crowds aides 
predict 200000 will attend his closing rally in buenos aires on 
tuesday 
angelozs prescription for the countrys economic ills is 
conservative sell inefficient state companies balance the 
national budget encourage foreign investment curb the power of 
organized labor increase exports pay the foreign debt 
menem a 58yearold governor recognizes the same problems 
tripledigit inflation high unemployment stagnant gross national 
product a foreign debt of 59 billion that is third highest in the 
developing world but proposes other solutions 
to curb the budget deficit he would raise taxes to reduce the 
burden of state companies he would increase their efficiency 
rather than sell them to resolve the foreign debt he would 
negotiate with creditors a moratorium on payments for several years 
the two represent different constituencies angeloz the middle 
class and menem organized labor state employees and the poor 
apartment owners have taken their properties off the market 
fearing if elected menem might implement a rent freeze investors 
have sent hundreds of millions of dollars out of the country 
fearing exchange controls under a peronist government 
watching developments from the sidelines are the armed forces 
which overthrew juan domingo peron in 1955 arturo frondizi in 
1962 arturo illia in 1966 and isabel peron in 1976 
disgruntled officers staged three insurrections against 
president alfonsin between april 1987 and december 1988 with the 
trials of officers a key grievance 
angeloz has tried to distance himself from an unpopular 
government and capitalize on what he calls the public fear of 
menem 
at every opportunity he brings up the street violence 
corruption and administrative incompetence of the peronist 
government headed by isabel peron the generals third wife 
results may not be known until aug 10 when the electoral 
college discloses the tally of its 600 members 
the inauguration wont be until dec 10 the final day of 
alfonsins sixyear term

a judge has tentatively approved a 
settlement of a decadeold classaction racial discrimination 
lawsuit filed by black civilian employees of mcchord air force base 
us district court judge robert bryan said friday that he found 
the settlement fair and reasonable but the agreement wont be 
final before midaugust 
about 125 current and former black employees who were denied 
promotions they sought or who were discouraged from applying are 
eligible to receive a total of 415000 in back wages the 
government agreed to pay under the agreement the suit included 
about 300 current and former black employees 
williams said payments should range between about 500 and 
15000 
the settlement is designed to correct what black employees said 
was a system that fostered discrimination in promotions at the 
base the federal government did not admit wrongdoing in the 
agreement 
im very confident that the people in the civilian personnel 
office will make a legitimate effort to ensure that what occurred 
in the past does not occur in the future said sidney a 
williams who has worked at mcchord for 33 years and filed the 
original claim in 1979 
if nobody ever complains nothing ever changes williams 
said 
the preliminary settlement provides for the promotions of 12 
blacks to currently vacant supervisory positions or higherpaying 
positions that eventually could lead to supervisory posts 
the promoted blacks also would participate in future promotion 
decisions at mcchord 
raphael gomez attorney for the air force said he wouldnt 
comment on the settlement 
the federal government fought the case for more than 10 years 
the first four in a fruitless effort to prevent the suit from being 
certified as a class action

jackson to aid victims of the dec 7 earthquake in armenia 
geldof said jackson has asked for his help in that eighthour 
concert scheduled for aug 12 
calling television a hindrance to understanding and the 
single worst antidemocratic force in the world today geldof 
told the broadcasters the mass media concentrates on images quick 
interviews and controversy at the expense of improving 
understanding 
controversy is not necessarily information he said 
giving facts is not enough 
he called on broadcasters to communicate directly to the people

six years after deciding rural hospitals could 
live on less than their urban counterparts congress appears ready 
to revise the medicare payment schedule to give a financial boost 
to isolated hospitals 
but finding money to bring rural hospitals to the same 
reimbursement level as their city counterparts will be tough in 
these days of tight budgets says sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
sponsor of the equity for rural hospitals act 
moreover bentsen cautions that no single bill will solve all of 
the problems of rural hospitals and federal health officials say 
medicare cannot be the sole source of a hospitals survival 
for some hospitals no matter what you do to the medicare 
system you would not save the hospital or have a significant 
impact said louis b hays acting administrator of the federal 
health care financing administration 
medicare is just one piece of the picture and there is nothing 
medicare can do to produce more patients for a hospital that has a 
10 percent occupancy rate hays said 
although health and human services secretary louis sullivan is 
concerned about ensuring access to health care in rural and inner 
city areas the department has not yet taken a position on 
bentsens bill said spokesman campbell gardett 
bentsen chairman of the finance committee said bringing rural 
hospitals to the same reimbursement levels as their urban 
counterparts would cost 700 million annually when fully phased in 
his bill cosponsored by senate minority leader bob dole and 
backed by senate majority leader george mitchell calls for phasing 
in a uniform medicare reimbursement rate beginning in 1991 
but sen tom harkin diowa and a member of the senate rural 
health caucus warned the finance committee last week that congress 
could face a drastic price tag for rebuilding the rural health 
care system if quick action is not taken 
ill do what i can to accelerate it bentsen said friday in 
an interview you have to find the money to accelerate it thats 
the problem in these budget constraints i expect to get some money 
for it but not as much as those rural hospitals would want in that 
first year 
im optimistic about the chances for passing my rural hospital 
bill this year and im making it a high priority bentsen said 
i have some 56 senators cosponsoring it ive got my forces 
well marshaled 
numerous other bills have been introduced in congress to deal 
with the rural health care crisis including legislation that seeks 
to impose a oneyear moratorium on medicare cuts in reimbursements 
to rural hospitals 
when congress established the medicare prospective payment 
system pps in 1983 lawmakers assumed rural hospital cost would 
be lower than city hospitals under pps rural hospitals are 
reimbursed at least 12 percent less than urban hospitals by 
medicare the governments health insurance program for the 
elderly and disabled 
but lawmakers say that differential can no longer be justified 
rural hospitals frequently pay higher labor costs because of the 
difficulty of attracting professionals to an isolated area they 
arent big enough to buy supplies in bulk they are more dependent 
on medicare patients than city hospitals and the costs of indigent 
health have become a growing financial burden 
sen dave durenberger rminn said the problems of rural 
hospitals also stem in part from the changing demographics and 
economic environment of rural communities 
the country as a whole is developing a twotrack economy 
durenberger told the finance committee the more prosperous one 
is centered in major cities on both coasts and in stark contrast 
the heartland communities are in recession

new coke is 4 years old and an alsoran in the 
cola wars but cocacola co says theres plenty of fizz left in 
the beverage that helped revolutionize the marketing of soft drinks 
cocacola was the worlds most popular soft drink and more the 
brand had become a symbol of the pervasive influence of american 
power and culture around the globe 
so it was no small decision when the company decided to 
reformulate the cola it had sold for 99 years and it triggered no 
small reaction the consumer backlash to the new drink was so 
strong that the company quickly brought back the original formula 
under the name cocacola classic 
four years later what goes by the label of coke is virtually 
ignored by consumers while classic coke reigns no 1 but company 
officials say they have no plans to drop the new formula and 
industry analysts say theyre right 
its regarded as the absolute biggest marketing travesty ever 
hoisted on the american public with gods help everyone will have 
similar mistakes said jesse meyers who publishes beverage 
digest in greenwich conn 
the announcement of new coke gave new birth to all cocacola 
products and the entire soft drink industry he said 
the introduction of the new coke heated up the cola wars 
and saw companies step up their efforts to introduce new variations 
of their namebrand products to gain a greater share of the 45 
billion softdrink market now there is not only coke and classic 
coke but diet coke caffeinefree coke and even regular and diet 
cherry coke 
archrival pepsico may regard the new coke as a pretty nominal 
player but it believes a companys full product line is more 
important than any single drink said spokesman todd mackenzie 
the parts make up the whole mackenzie said 
indeed cocacola emphasizes that its entire line of soft drinks 
is strong and claims to hold a dominant 337 percent share of the 
retail market 
the brand name with the new formula that for years was the 
bestseller had dropped to 10th place at the end of 1988 tied with 
rc cola and caffeinefree diet pepsi the new coke had a mere 14 
percent of the market down from 16 percent in 1987 according to 
beverage digest 
by contrast classic coke the old coke with the new name 
held the no 1 position with 201 percent of the market pepsi cola 
was no 2 with 187 percent 
even with its slim market share the new coke makes money and 
generates 675 million a year in revenue said randy donaldson a 
spokesman at the companys atlanta headquarters 
if cocacola had any other name on it it would be perceived 
as a huge success donaldson said because the can has 
cocacola on it the expectations were huge 
emanuel goldman a soft drink industry analyst with paine webber 
inc in san francisco said the new coke still sold 4 billion cans 
last year which makes it unlikely the company would drop it 
there are people still drinking it he said if they take 
it away they may go somewhere else 
donaldson said taste tests continue to show consumers like new 
coke better than pepsi 
improving the taste was behind the decision to alter the 
formula the company said when it announced the change in april 
1985 
the new coke hit the stores on may 8 of that year the 99th 
anniversary of the date the first cocacola was sold but 
notwithstanding test results the backlash was swift and harsh from 
consumers who resented the removal of a drink they had enjoyed for 
generations 
two months later cocacola apologized to the public and brought 
back the old formula as classic coke 
theres no question it didnt work out as planned donaldson 
said 
still the bungling hasnt tarnished the vaunted brand name 
meyers asserts 
in the publics mind what they call coke is what the company 
is atlanta calls cocacola classic he said

defense secretary dick cheney on sunday 
restated his view that the united states should be cautious in 
reaching an arms accord with the soviet union based simply on the 
apparent goodwill of kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the us needs to proceed cautiously conservatively and 
make certain we are not dealing with a temporary aberration in 
soviet behavior cheney said in an interview on the abctv 
program this week with david brinkley 
cheney addressing various aspects of us strategic policy 
said the administration 
refuses to negotiate with the soviets on the withdrawal of 
shortrange nuclear weapons from europe because it is first 
necessary to eliminate the 2to1 warsaw pact edge in conventional 
forces west german chancellor helmut kohl whose party faces a 
tough election next year has been urging washington to open such 
talks 
will encourage development of democratic governments in 
sovietcontrolled eastern europe 
places great hope in the eventual development of star wars 
defenses although it reduced the budget requested for the 
strategic defense initiative from president reagans proposal of 
58 billion to 46 billion next year 
cheney sparked a debate in washington last week by predicting 
that gorbachevs reforms would fail and that he would be replaced 
by someone more hostile to the west 
that observation repeated three times over the course of a 
week prompted president bush and secretary of state james a baker 
iii to declare that they hoped gorbachevs reforms would succeed 
cheney said sunday that he thought his remarks got 
overplayed 
even so full details of the new administration policy toward 
moscow remained unclear 
baker was expected to disclose the administrations arms control 
stance this week during a visit to moscow in a speech last week 
baker echoed cheneys cautious attitude noting that the soviets 
continue to pose a significant military threat to western 
interests 
cheney said sunday that the key emphasis on arms control in 
europe ought to be on conventional force reductions that the 
soviets retain an overwhelming conventional superiority 
he ruled out talks on shortrange nuclear missiles before the 
conclusion of ongoing conventional arms talks in which both sides 
have proposed sharp cuts that would end sovietbloc numerical 
superiority in tanks and troops in central europe 
we do not foresee a set of circumstances in which you would 
have us troops deployed in western europe where you would not 
also have as a significant component of deterrence nuclear weapons 
shortrange nuclear forces thats a fact of life said cheney 
in related developments two leading democrats in congress and 
the chief arms control aide to thenpresident reagan urged the bush 
administration to take a more flexible approach in negotiating with 
the soviets 
the chairman of the house armed services committee rep aspin 
dwis urged the administration to consider mandate talks with 
the soviets to decide how to deal with the issue of shortrange 
nuclear missiles in europe 
rep lee hamilton dind said he did not think we can 
sustain the position that we will not negotiate on the shortrange 
nuclear weapons hamilton proposed that any reductions be linked 
to cuts in soviet conventional forces 
paul nitze who served as reagans senior arms control adviser 
said he did not see how the west german government could agree to 
the dual policy of the bush administration urging modernization of 
the shortrange lance missile while refusing to enter talks with 
the soviets on that class of weapons 
aspin and nitze both appeared on abctv hamilton appeared on 
the nbctv show meet the press

as prime minister benazir bhutto 
begins her sixth month in office she faces rising domestic 
opposition that is undermining her power in the four provinces 
the squabbling has interfered with her push to implement a 
populist socioeconomic program focused on local projects to 
improve health education and public works 
ms bhutto 35 was sworn in as prime minister dec 2 to become 
the first woman leader in the modern moslem world her pakistan 
peoples party was popularly elected nov 16 in pakistans first 
free election in more than a decade 
she rode a wave of sympathy for her father prime minister 
zulfikar ali bhutto deposed by gen mohammad zia ulhaq in 1977 
and later executed on charges of conspiracy to murder a political 
opponent zia died in a plane crash in august 1988 
ms bhuttos opponents have done a great deal to curb the 
sympathy wave since her election 
she ranks a close second in popularity after bipartisan 
president ghulam ishaq khan according to a recent gallup poll 
conducted among pakistans urban dwellers 
nevertheless ms bhuttos nemesis is her opponents in the 
provincial governments who either are challenging her leadership 
or deserting coalitions headed by her party which she describes as 
a social democratic party 
the pakistan peoples party aided by smaller parties and 
independents still controls the powerful national assembly or 
lower house of parliament but the provincial skirmishes already 
have limited her political and economic options 
in punjab the biggest and richest province and home to 56 
percent of the population ms bhutto mounted two major asssaults 
by moving a vote of no confidence against rightwing chief minister 
nawaz sharif in the provincial legislative assembly both attempts 
fell short of a majority 
sharifs pakistan muslim league is the linchpin of the 
nationwide eightparty islamic democratic alliance 
bhutto wants to do away with all of her opponents in order to 
create oneparty rule in pakistan charged sharif 
in volatile sindh the southern province the bhuttos call home 
chief minister syed qaim ali shah of the pakistan peoples party 
commands 84 of 114 votes in the legislative assembly 
but after months of squabbling a 28member group called mohajir 
qaumi movement consisting of moslem immigrants from india pulled 
out of the coalition may 1 
shah failed to protect the lives of immigrant students and 
mohajir population which is facing violence by the local 
population in numerous cities said azim tariq chief of the 
moslem party 
newspaper reports say that mohajirs fearing violence from 
native sindhis are deserting their villages and towns and 
migrating to major cities such as karachi and hyderabad 
the powerful and vocal mohajir movement can cause ms bhuttos 
party plenty of trouble 
she is upset by recurrent violence in sindh 
there is a miniinsurgency she said in a recent speech it 
is like a crushed egg which needs delicate handling to bring it 
into its original shape 
ethnic riots involving the mohajirs and other groups have left 
nearly 700 dead since 1985 
ms bhuttos provincial coalition cabinet in north west frontier 
province along the afghanistan border collapsed on april 27 when 
the prosoviet awami peoples national party pulled out 
leaders of that party said she reneged on a promise to give them 
the provincial governorship in exchange for their role as a 
coalition partner 
bhutto failed to keep each one of her promises said nasim 
wali khan a veteran womens leader of the party 
ms bhuttos provincial chief minister aftab ahmad sherpao still 
has support of 37 legislators the largest single bloc in a 
house of 86 after the 14member awami national party quit however 
opponents in ms bhuttos party warn that the future loyalties of 
10 of sherpaos supporters can waver 
the southwestern province of baluchistan also bordering 
afghanistan is in the hands of another group of bhutto opponents 
led by nawab akbar bugti bugti is the provincial chief minister 
and leader of the baluchistan national alliance 
he is supported by the islamic democratic alliance in addition 
to the rightwing jamaateulemaeislam islamic scholars party 
the groups are peeved at ms bhuttos refusal to give baluchistan a 
larger share of federal tax revenues and royalties on oil and 
natural gas produced in the province 
pakistan is facing a 12 percent annual inflation rate compared 
to 5 percent last year the prices of some essential goods have 
gone up 18 percent 
a wage hike will push prices up further and enlarge the current 
275 billion federal budget deficit it equals about 67 percent 
of pakistans gross domestic product 
the next national budget due june 1 may fuel more inflation as 
independent economists fear more taxes across the board

the doghouse or the henhouse foghorn 
is a bit confused about home 
the rooster has turned up his beak at the hens on polly 
johnsons farm to share a large turnedover barrel with a 
friendly female mutt named muffin 
what we have here is a pretty unnatural situation mrs 
johnson said 
foghorn is a silky rooster rather than one of the more popular 
varieties of farm roosters such as rhode island red she said his 
feathers are unique more like hair she said maybe thats 
why he thinks he belongs in the doghouse instead of the henhouse 
muffin a mediumsized dog with german shepherd features 
doesnt seem to mind the company the two are pals and sleep 
together in the barrel turned on its side that serves as muffins 
home 
mrs johnson tried to confine the rooster with the hens after 
she was given foghorn this spring but he wouldnt have anything to 
do with his own kind and soon sought out the dog 
he doesnt seem to care a thing about the hens mrs johnson 
said 
muffin recently got away from her feathered companion long 
enough to mate with her own species shes the mother of a new 
litter 
when it comes to dogs people will believe about anything but 
they wont believe muffin and foghorn until they see it mrs 
johnson said after they see it they get a funny look on their 
face

the percentage of victims of rape robbery and 
assault who were physically injured during the attack increased 
from 1979 to 1986 according to a department of justice survey 
caroline wolf harlow the statistician who prepared the report 
issued sunday said that although violent crime rates dropped about 
11 percent from 1973 to 1986 the number of injuries about 22 
million a year did not 
since injuries have remained relatively constant over the 
period a higher proportion of victims of violent crime today are 
injured she said 
the report covered only rape robbery and assault for people at 
least 12 years old it did not cover murder manslaughter and child 
abuse 
the report was based on findings of the national crime survey 
which questioned an average of 116000 respondents in 55000 
households in each year of the survey the results include crimes 
not reported to police 
because of the large percentage of people questioned each year 
compared with the total number of crime victims the results are 
not subject to the margin of error limitations of a smaller poll 
over the years 19791986 a total of about 63 million people in 
the united states were victims of rape robbery or assault of whom 
177 million were injured the report concluded 
of the average 22 million people hurt each year 357830 
suffered serious injury and 183 million suffered minor injury 
about 1 percent or almost 23000 people suffered gunshot wounds 
about 77000 had knife wounds 141500 suffered broken bones or 
teeth 64000 had internal injuries and 84000 lost consciousness 
according to the report 
the percentage of victims who were injured during the attack was 
275 percent in 1973 and remained relatively constant except for a 
drop to 269 percent in 1982 before climbing the next few years to 
303 percent in 1986 ms harlow said in an interview citing 
figures not included in the report which covered only 197986 
the actual rate of violent crime that is the number of victims 
of rape robbery or assault per 1000 people decreased 
substantially in the last few years of the survey she said 
the highest rate since 1973 was in 1981 when 456 per 1000 
were victims of such crimes that number dropped to 367 per 1000 
in 1986 but preliminary figures for 1987 and 1988 indicate the 
rate has increased again ms harlow said 
meanwhile the injury rate the number of people per 1000 who 
suffered injuries as victims of those violent crimes stayed 
relatively stable in 1973 the rate was 114 per 1000 it rose to 
a high of 127 in 1981 and then dropped to 111 in 1986 she said 
neither ms harlow nor the report she compiled gave reasons for 
the 1981 spike in crime and injury rates 
while almost half of the injured victims received some medical 
care including almost a fourth being treated in an emergency room 
or hospital one in 25 a total of about 87650 people needed to 
stay overnight in the hospital the report found 
those most likely to suffer injuries were men blacks people 
age 19 to 24 people with at most a high school education those 
who were separated or divorced poor people with family incomes 
under 10000 a year and residents of central cities 
those least likely to be injured were women whites widows 
those 50 or older people with family incomes of 30000 or more 
those who had attended college for a year or more and those who 
lived outside metropolitan areas

moody beach property owners who won a court 
battle over control of access to the milelong stretch of sandy 
shore reacted angrily sunday as town officials proposed that the 
beach be reopened to the public anyway 
i object to allowing hordes of people to come onto my 
property landowner andy galt said at a special meeting called by 
town manager jonathan carter this is private land every one of 
us knows that 
even though the town of wells and the state attorney generals 
office were the losers in late march when the maine supreme court 
ruled that the property owners can bar the public from the beach 
carter told landowners sunday that the town would agree to maintain 
the beach if it could be opened to the public 
the town will comply with the court decision carter said 
in the short term we want to see if the property owners 
would consider opening it up for the summer the summer of 1989 
the town is seeking an appraisal of the beach to consider taking 
it through eminent domain and carter found no enthusiasm for his 
proposal to keep the beach public in the meantime 
i dont feel that you people considered that these are 
individual pieces of land property owner dorothy jones said 
we are not operating as a country club group or a condominium 
group i may decide on tuesday ill let everybody there on 
wednesday i may get up grumpy and say nobody i intend to keep 
that right 
sandy shore is rare in maine making up just 35 miles of the 
3500mile meandering coastline which is mostly rocky 
the divided supreme court ruled in march that the only public 
access right to the beach was granted in a 17th century colonial 
ordinance that permits access for fishing bird hunting and boating 
mrs jones and other moody beach owners complained that for 
years thousands of tourists have come to the beach without 
respecting their property 
the landowners asked town selectmen sunday whether it would be 
possible to stop local motels and campgrounds from bringing in 
tourists on buses but town attorney gordon ayer said there would 
be constitutional problems with such a ban 
after the landowners made it clear they would not consider 
opening the beach to the public carter said that the town will 
abide by the court ruling but he has said it will be difficult to 
keep tourists away

syrian and christian gunners blasted 
residential districts of beirut on sunday in savage artillery duels 
that killed at least 20 people as the arab league moved quickly to 
try to revive a collapsed truce 
a police spokesman said 100 people were wounded in a sevenhour 
bombardment that left the streets blanketed with debris 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said about 20000 shells and rockets were unleashed on the divided 
capital and surrounding areas 
fires burned out of control in both moslem and christian 
sectors hundreds of charred cars smoldered in parking lots and 
severed power cables dangled from twisted poles or shellpocked 
apartment buildings 
almost every district every street and every alley is 
shelled the capital looks like it has been struck by a killer 
earthquake the spokesman said 
blazing pine trees lit up the night sky as christian artillery 
positions began the exchange by firing 155mm howitzers at syrian 
and druse positions across beirut and neighboring hills 
the syrians responded with rocket fire at christian east beirut 
the citys port the christian harbors of jounieh and byblos and a 
cluster of deserted summer resorts in lebanons central mountains 
the deaths and woundings increased the overall toll to 298 
killed and 1111 wounded since the latest round of fighting in 
lebanons 14yearold civil war broke out march 8 
the fighting pits army commander gen michel aouns 20000 
mainly christian soldiers against an alliance of syrian troops and 
7000 militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party 
the christians resumed shelling saturday night after nine days 
of unanswered syrian attacks on the christian sectors coast those 
attacks were in defiance of an april 28 ceasefire called by the 
arab league 
aoun told the us british and french ambassadors on saturday 
night that he would respond to the syrian fire a spokesman for his 
headquarters said an hour later the christian firing began 
the syrians and their allies have said they will keep shelling 
until the arab league dispatches a multinational 321man observer 
force to monitor the truce they want the observer force in place 
to prevent arms from reaching aouns forces 
but the current escalation threatened to block the arrival of 
the observer force under the command of kuwaiti brig gen ali 
almomen it will be drawn from the armies of jordan kuwait 
tunisia algeria sudan and north yemen 
arab league secretarygeneral chedli klibi sent fresh appeals 
sunday to aoun and to acting prime minister salim hoss to spare 
no effort to restore the ceasefire and enable the observers to 
deploy within the next few days 
klibi also immediately dispatched his deputy kakhadar ibrahimi 
back to damascus and beirut to resume his peacemaking mission 
sources at the arab leagues tunis headquarters said 
a mediation panel set up by the arab league in january has made 
four ceasefire calls all have collapsed although the league had 
promised this last one would be different because it would be 
monitored by the observer force 
when the shelling slackened at dawn tens of thousands of dazed

the chairman of the house committee that 
investigated the irancontra scandal on sunday labeled as 
unsatisfactory president bushs explanation of his role in an 
arrangement to provide the nicaraguan rebels with aid 
im not satisfied with his answers said rep lee hamilton 
dind i think we need to know a lot more about thenvice 
president bushs activities 
on thursday the same day a jury returned its verdict in oliver 
norths trial bush said there was no quid pro quo arrangement 
discussed in his meeting in early 1985 with honduran president 
roberto suazo 
documents introduced during norths trial indicated that 
president reagan approved a deal in 1985 in which us military and 
economic aid to honduras would be expedited in return for honduran 
aid to the contras 
at the time congress had banned us aid to the contras who 
were camped just inside honduras border with nicaragua 
hamilton appearing on nbcs meet the press cited past 
white house denials of arms sales to iran and of central 
intelligence agency involvement in supplying the contras with aid 
allegations that later proved to be true 
im skeptical he said regarding bushs denial thursday of 
talking with suazo about any arrangement to indirectly funnel aid 
to the contras thats the whole story of irancontra i think 
im bound to be skeptical of what the executive branch has said to 
me 
hamilton said the documents in norths trial show that we 
contacted honduras we increased aid to honduras and honduras in 
return aided the contras 
those documents are about as clear a statement of quid pro quo 
as you will ever see he said they are contrary to what the 
president says we ought to pursue them 
however there is no immediate need to recovene the house and 
senate irancontra committees hamilton said the next step he 
said is for the intelligence panels of both bodies to obtain the 
documents and examine them 
sen richard lugar rind former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee called new efforts to link bush to the 
irancontra affair a bad mistake not only in terms of foreign 
policy but just in terms of general public policy in this 
country 
throughout the entire period of the reagan administration we 
were giving a lot of assistance to honduras he said and we 
did so simply because they were very helpful to our foriegn policy 
and the prosecution of what we were doing in nicaragua

the relief plane executed a corkscrew dive 
in case of missile attack leveled off and landed in torit a 
oncebustling southern town transformed by civil war and fa mine 
into a dusty rebel outpost 
shoeless young men wearing only tattered shorts and glistening 
with sweat unloaded the 14 tons of maize it was the planes 
second delivery of the day 
under the shade of a mango tree beyond a ridge of earthen 
fortifications rebels in army fatigues and civilians in ragged 
clothing relaxed and watched what has become a regular exercise 
the airlift is part of a program coordinated by the united 
nations to save 100000 southern sudanese from starvation by 
stocking food throughout the region before the annual rains which 
begin this month and will make roads and airstrips unusable 
operation lifelinesudan begun april 1 and expected to cost 
132 million is intended to prevent a repeat of last years 
disaster 
the director of the operation said sunday that it was well 
behind schedule but virtually certain to stave off massive 
starvation 
the back of the disaster has been broken the director 
james p grant told a nairobi news conference 
he said about 45000 tons of food and supplies has been moved 
into southern sudan and another 50000 tons is expected to be moved 
into the region by the end of june 
the operations deadline was pushed back a month due to the 
delays and will continue to deliver food into southern sudan 
through the rainy season said grant 
deliveries could not begin until the government and rebels 
agreed to suspend fighting along specified corridors of 
tranquility along which the food and other supplies could move 
aid is being sent to both rebelheld areas and those controlled by 
the army 
a monthlong truce followed the initial agreement but the 
original goal of stockpiling 170000 tons of supplies in the south 
still is unlikely to be achieved 
relief officials say as many as 500000 people died of drought 
flood and famine exacerbated by the 6yearold war between the army 
and the rebel sudan peoples liberation army led by former col 
john garang 
most southern sudanese are black predominantly christian or 
animist garang and his rebel army are fighting for autonomy and a 
better economic deal from the government in the arab moslem north 
no one knows for sure how many of torits 30000 people perished 
before rebel fighters drove out the last soldiers in february 
ending a yearlong siege of this river town ringed by the jagged 
imatong mountains un officials estimate up to 1000 died each 
month 
rebels found fewer than 1000 civilians remaining in the towns 
huts of mud and thatch relief officials said the rest had died or 
fled into the bush to escape the war and to forage for food 
residents who stayed or have returned since february say they 
were denied any of the supplies government soldiers received 
through army airdrops and survived on mangoes and a cloverlike 
weed the local latuga tribe calls ogasik 
laudina legga 28 said 15 members of her family starved to 
death before she her mother and her two children fled to the bush 
early this year 
we ate only ogasik for nine months she said in a 
conversation on a dirt road ms legga was returning home from the 
relief plane with a basket of maize balanced on her head 
she and the others returned to torit at the end of april lured 
by the new security and growing stocks of food the united nations 
says about 20000 people have come back to the town and surrounding 
area since the rebels took control 
many huts still appeared empty during a tour of the town people 
interviewed seemed in good health and relatively wellfed 
olaug husby one of three norwegian church aid health workers 
based in torit said the apparent lack of hunger was partly due to 
resumed harvesting of food from the countryside other relief 
officials said the people may not have been as desperate this year 
as had been thought 
whatever the explanation they are not starving now said 
ben martinson a un representative coordinating storage in torit 
he said some of the relief food had been distributed but most 
would be stockpiled for the rainy season when floods normally 
isolate torit until november 
un officials expect the towns population to reach 50000 
with the influx of refugees and plan to stock 8000 tons of food 
martinson said about a quarter of that had been delivered by may 1 
two weeks after airlifts and road convoys started moving from 
uganda and kenya 
convoys from kenya were suspended may 1 three days after the 
second attack along the road eight rebel escorts were killed april 
18 when a missile destroyed the lead vehicle in the first attack 
on a relief convoy 
martinson said he suspected the raids were carried out by 
tribesmen in the area or by ugandan insurgents who had filtered 
into southern sudan

out before dawn two hours before polls opened at 7 am while 
still others just sweated in the sun 
everybody votes in the morning then goes home to wait said 
nellida galvez an opposition party pollwatcher

booths by pollwatchers and the somewhat cumbersome process of 
casting ballots but voters remained in the long lines

pollwatchers arrayed behind them at ballot box 2742 inside one of 
seven sheds placed on a dusty lot in downtown panama city 
voters stepped up to the bench and proferred their identity 
cards which were checked and punched a man whose id card did not 
quite match the registration list was allowed to cast his ballot 
after a quick discussion among poll officials and pollwatchers 
we all know each other here said one official the 
instructions say to assume minor problems are just mistakes or 
typos 
the turnout at 2742 as at others throughout the nation was 
extremely heavy by 8 am more than 100 of the 348 people assigned 
to the station were in line but only 20 people had voted

loud cheers broke out when a woman who had taken fully five 
minutes to complete the process finally emerged poll officials 
brought forward the elderly and the handicapped saying they did 
not have to wait in line 
complaints were minor voters at one booth said they tried to 
disguise their motions as they selected their cards because the 
curtain was too short and allowed officials to see inside 
pollwatchers at box 2742 complained that the booths light bulb 
had been stolen which would complicate the initial count after 
polls close at 5 pm 
ill get a flashlight said ricardo duran another 
opposition pollwatcher 
no ill have my father bring a light bulb from home said

iranian president ali khamenei on sunday 
indirectly endorsed as his successor parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani who has urged a terror campaign against westerners to 
avenge the deaths of palestinians in the israelioccupied lands 
khamenei also backed constitutional reforms that are expected to 
give the president more executive power said irans official 
islamic republic news agency 
the agency monitored in nicosia quoted khamenei as telling 
worshipers in tehran fortunately the peoples attention has 
naturally been drawn to one of the most prominent faces of the 
islamic republic 
khamenei did not mention rafsanjani by name but made an obvious 
reference to him saying the candidate that some groups have 
identified for the presidency revives this hope in us that god 
willing our nation will have a much brighter future 
rafsanjani 54 one of irans most prominent political 
personalities is the only declared candidate so far in 
presidential elections scheduled for late summer two influential 
clerical groups one composed of hardliners and the other of 
liberal theologians have said they will back the parliament 
speaker 
khamenei a longtime political ally of rafsanjani made the 
endorsement during a sermon to mark the eid alfitr feast that ends 
the moslem holy month of ramadan 
god willing this year the matter of the presidency will be 
good news for our people he said 
under the 1980 constitution the 50yearold president cannot 
run for a third fouryear term 
rafsanjani who also serves as acting commander of the armed 
forces earned a reputation as a moderate through his support for 
rebuilding ties with western nations he hoped to speed 
reconstruction of the country after the eightyearlong persian 
gulf war halted by a unmediated ceasefire on aug 20 
but he recently changed tack supporting iranian leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeneis feb 14 call for the death of british 
author salman rushdie 
and in an inflammatory speech broadcast friday rafsanjani said 
five american french or british citizens should be killed in 
retaliation for each arab slain in the uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip he urged palestinians to 
hijack planes or blow up factories in western countries in order to 
pressure israel to release prisoners 
last month rafsanjani backed a decision by khomeini to amend 
the constitution and said he hoped the reforms would give the next 
president more power 
executive power is divided between khamenei and prime minister 
hussein musavi khomeini has the last word in decisionmaking as 
the countrys spiritual leader 
but the prime minister holds more authority than the president 
and khamenei has said that must be rectified if iran is to have a 
strong government 
khomeini appointed a 20man committee to revise the 
constitution which must then be approved by the people in a 
referendum 
both rafsanjani and khamenei are committee members analysts 
have speculated the committee may suggest the prime ministers job 
be abolished altogether 
in his sermon khamenei was quoted as saying a stronger 
presidency and constitutional reforms would allow greater room 
for realizing the nations potential 
also sunday the president opened the tehran international book 
fair with an attack on the west for supporting rushdies book the 
satanic verses the official news agency reported 
we can see how colonialist hands are supporting a writer and 
publishers who have insulted the sanctities of 1 billion moslems 
the agency quoted khamenei as saying 
the book prompted worldwide protests by moslems who view it as 
blasphemous rushdie has been in hiding since khomeini called for 
his death 
the news agency said despite a boycott by some western 
publishers 237 foreign publishers and 270 local companies are 
participating in the 12day fair

was missing since feb 16 was found sunday buried near the occupied 
gaza strip and israeli officials accused palestinian guerrillas of 
killing him 
hundreds of angry israelis gathered outside the victims home in 
the port city of ashdod shouting death to the arabs 
israel radio said some israelis attacked an arab laborer at a 
nearby grocery store it said police rescued the arab and sealed 
off the area

curfews ordering 450000 palestinians to stay in their homes 
twelve of the wounded were shot in clashes in rafah gaza city 
and three refugee camps the hospital officials said they said at 
least three were shot in the occupied west bank the army said it 
had no reports of woundings 
the slain soldier avi sassportaz 21 disappeared after leaving 
his southern base for his home he was last seen hitchhiking at a 
junction about 10 miles from the gaza strip 
there is no doubt its homicide preliminary findings show he 
was shot an army spokesman said israel radio however said a 
knife was found near the body 
the radio said sassportaz was found when private investigators 
who were searching for stolen cars in a helicopter landed and 
spotted a hand sticking out of the ground 
the army backed by police and volunteers had searched 
extensively for sassportaz since his disappearance at one point 
the search covered 200 square miles and involved 22500 people 
late in february a caller claiming to represent the palestinian 
arab army a previously unknown group told the agence france 
presse news agency and israel radio the group was holding 
sassportaz it demanded the release of 1500 palestinians 
meanwhile some 1300 soldiers carried out a massive search in 
the area north of gaza for another israeli soldier believed 
kidnapped 
the soldier ilan saadon 18 was last seen wednesday getting 
into a white car driven by men wearing skullcaps of observant jews 
we dont know if there is a link whether this was done by 
the same guerrilla group police minister chaim barlev told 
israel radio so far he is missing 
this disguise passing off as religious people we are 
familiar with this technique he added 
saadons tearful mother said on israel television that this 
boy is my soulim only asking god to let him come back in 
peace 
sassportazs death raised to 21 the number of israelis killed in 
the 17month arab uprising along with 465 palestinians 
the army said sunday its investigation of saturdays clashes in 
the gaza strip showed two palestinians were killed and 77 wounded 
as soldiers opened fire to quell protests on eid alfitr a major 
moslem holiday 
arab hospital officials reported three killed and 135 injured in 
the saturday violence the toll of wounded was the highest in a 
single day in gaza since the start of the uprising 
in tel aviv chief military spokesman brig gen ephraim lapid 
defended the army against palestinians charges that the presence 
of soldiers outside a mosque in the nusseirat refugee camp provoked 
the clashes saturday 
the local people in gaza searched for confrontation with 
israeli soldiers 
according to arab reports the trouble saturday began as moslems 
leaving morning prayers found about 100 soldiers waiting outside 
the mosque stonethrowing started and the troops opened fire 
also in the west bank jewish settlers announced they founded a 
new settlement near nahalin the arab village where five 
palestinians were killed last month in one of the worst 
confrontations with israeli forces in the uprising 
more than 70000 israelis already live in about 130 settlements 
among the 17 million palestinians in the occupied lands the us 
government has called the settlements an obstacle to peace

authorities who fear more ethnic strife took a 
conciliatory tone with armenian protesters sunday dispersing 
several thousand of them with a pledge to allow a rally later this 
week a local journalist said 
gen maj mikhail surkhov of the local military district 
confronted the protesters in yerevan the capital of armenia 
according to an editor with armenpress the republics official 
news agency he persuaded the crowd to break up by assuring them a 
legal demonstration could be held on thursday the journalist said 
the editor who spoke in a telephone interview on condition of 
anonymity said the protesters were demanding freedom for members 
of the karabakh committee who have been jailed since december the 
group led calls last year for the annexation of nagornokarabakh 
an armeniandominated region of neighboring azerbaijan 
the dispute between the two southwestern republics led to the 
deaths of more than 90 people in ethnic violence last year the 
kremlin placed the disputed region under its own control 
a new round of ethnic protests broke out last week 
local activist rafael popoyan also speaking by telephone 
reported strikes by students outside the university and other 
schools in yerevan 
he said yerevan authorities arrested movzes gogkesian editor of 
the magazine motherland for an unknown reason 
popoyan also said a general strike was continuing in 
nagornokarabakh itself to back demands that the mountainous 
enclave be put under armenian control 
valeri sidorov speaking for the kremlinappointed commission 
now governing the disputed region said the strikers demands had 
been forwarded to moscow 
however he said local authorities were less worried about the 
strikes than about preventing a new outbreak of ethnic violence 
the situation has to be closely watched because the 
atmosphere is so tense he said 
several days ago authorities took a harsher tone warning they 
would use all available means to prevent more unrest

us law enforcers expressed relief 
sunday that four suspected members of a drugsmuggling cult that 
killed 15 people were arrested in mexico not the united states 
they committed the crimes in mexico said oran neck chief 
us customs agent in this border city at texas southern tip if 
they commited murder in mexico we cant charge them here 
cult leader adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 and a follower 
martin quintana rodriguez were killed in mexico city authorities 
said after a shootout there 
sara maria aldrete a former texas college honor student 
described as the godmother or witch of the cult was 
arrested at the same mexico city residence with four others 
suspected of belonging to the murderous drug ring 
ms aldrete 24 said in mexico city on sunday that constanzo 
ordered himself and his righthand man martin quintana rodriguez 
killed when police closed in 
fbi agent bob nixon of brownsville agreed that it was best that 
ms aldrete and the others were arrested in mexico 
its great nixon said it will save us from having to 
extradite them to mexico 
constanzo and ms aldrete were among 11 people indicted by a 
us federal grand jury in mcallen on drug charges in the case 
the only reason we were looking for them was so we could 
extradite them to mexico so they could be tried there nixon 
said the only purpose of the drug indictments here was to have 
probable cause to pick them up and turn them over to mexico 
the task force that handled the case included the fbi the us 
drug enforcement administration the customs service and the 
cameron county sheriffs department 
cameron county sheriff alex perez said he did not expect us 
officials to try to extradite those in custody in mexico to the 
united states 
i hope they stay over there in mexico because thats where 
the murders were coordinated and they have to stand trial over

under mexican law the worst punishment any of the suspects 
could receive is 50 years in prison

down a grassy hill to an open amphitheater overlooking the vistula 
river there walesa introduced the unions five candidates to 
represent the region in the sejm and the senate 
walesa emphasized his roots in the rural central polish region 
a threehour drive from his current home in the baltic port of 
gdansk he was born in the nearby village of popowo and told the 
crowd he had been baptized in plock 
he urged voters to take advantage of new reforms that allow 
limited opposition participation in the june 4 legislative 
elections for the first time in the history of communist poland 
if we stand aside someone else will shape this poland for 
us again so i appeal to you lets build poland together he 
said 
our representatives at the sejm and senate can create a 
platform from which we will jump into freedom and independence if 
we dont do that our chance to have influenced decisions will be 
much smaller walesa said 
the solidarityled opposition agreed to participate in elections 
as part of broad accords reached with authorities april 5 the 
agreement resulted in the legalization of the trade union movement 
after a sevenyear ban 
it also resulted in the creation of a new legislature the 
senate and moreopen elections for the existing parliament the 
sejm 
independent candidates can run for 161 seats of the 460member 
sejm in which a communistled alliance is still guaranteed a 
majority all seats are open to any candidates in the new 
100member senate the east blocs first freely elected legislative 
body 
the two chambers form the national assembly 
stanislaw stomma an 81yearold warsaw lawyer and roman 
catholic activist running for the senate with solidaritys 
endorsement thanked the crowd for the privilege of running from 
their town and said he would spend more time there if he were 
elected 
the law does not require candidates to live in the areas they 
seek to represent 
walesas close adviser andrzej celinski a 39yearold warsaw 
sociologist and candidate for the sejm told the crowd it will 
depend on us just how much freedom and justice and solidarity there 
will be in poland 
three other solidarity candidates for the sejm also made short 
speeches 
while union supporters in plock welcomed walesa warmly he drew 
some disapproving glances when he drove up to the bishops 
residence in a shiny blue mercedes 
dont worry its borrowed he said good thing quipped 
a woman in the crowd 
the opposition rally came during a threeday miners strike that 
has stopped nearly all copper mining in poland 
negotiators resumed talks sunday in an effort to find a 
compromise in the dispute according to solidarity information 
service in warsaw it gave no details however 
the strike involving about 20000 workers is the countrys 
first major bout of labor unrest since the opposition and 
government reached their accords last month 
the strike broke out at four mines near the city of lubin about 
200 miles southwest of warsaw the mines represent nearly all of 
polands copper production which is an important source of 
hardcurrency earnings

airline passengers who survived a 
crashlanding in the yucatan peninsula kept calm as they waited 
overnight for rescuers to cut their way through dense jungle a 
us official said sunday 
they did everything they could to help each other and to help 
themselves said gennie valdez a us consular representative 
who was working with crash victims 
the aerocozumel flight carrying 18 people mostly americans 
crashlanded at about 230 pm friday in a remote area about 40

a mexican navy helicopter saturday ferried the last survivor to 
a cancun hospital nearly 24 hours after the accident 
theyre in shock said valdez but i dont have anybody

emergency 
the most badly injured was a man with a broken hip said jaime 
valenzuela a representative for aerocozumel three people were 
released on saturday after undergoing brief observation valdez 
said

lives 
what ive heard is that most of those who died died 
instantly she said

cozumel after taking the tourists to view ancient indian ruins at 
chichen itza 115 miles west of cozumel

alaskas top environmental official 
testified sunday that a reluctant and myopic exxon stalled 
efforts to clean up the nations largest oil spill by largely 
ignoring damage outside the immediate spill zone 
dennis kelso commissioner of the state department of 
environmental conservation told a congressional panel the spill 
has caused 550 miles of oil filthy foam and tar balls 
he said that on the east coast it would be the equivalent of 
oil washing up on beaches from boston south to the mouth of 
chesapeake bay and possibly to the potomac river 
the industrys response was reluctant and myopic chacterized 
by stalling techniques disinformation and a refusal to pay real 
attention to damage outside of prince william sound kelso told 
the fivemember subcommittee of the house interior committee 
the congressional panel planned two days of hearings in valdez 
with testimony scheduled from state federal and exxon officials 
in another development sunday a state official said exxons 
decision to pull cleanup crews from an oilstained beach caught 
authorities by surprise but a spokesman for the oil company 
defended the decision 
the oil company removed its workers saturday from a 
pebblestrewn beach on the north edge of smith island a site 
described only shortly before by the ranking federal official in 
charge of the cleanup as far from clean the site was one of 
those visited last week by vice president dan quayle during his 
stopover in the state 
crews remained on the island but at another oilfouled landfall 
nearby exxon said the island is considered crucial to the annual 
seal pupping cycle 
the people who were here last night from exxon didnt know 
anything about this pete mcgee a scientist with the state 
department of environmental conservation said sunday exxon and 
state and federal officials have been conducting nightly meetings 
on the progress of the cleanup 
mcgee said state and federal officials were surprised that the 
beach cleanup was halted because the beach was not adequately 
clean 
exxon spokesman pete stilling said the cleanup crews were moved 
off the northern beach in order to attack more heavily soiled areas 
nearby 
i think we fully intend to come back to that beach i wont 
tell you well be back on that beach tomorrow stilling said 
exxons best judgment at this point is that its time to move 
on 
al ewing an assistant regional administrator of the us 
environmental protection agency said he was on the north beach 
saturday morning and found it still very difficult to walk on 
because of the oil 
exxon faces a wednesday deadline to have the worst of the oil 
cleansed from several islands in prince william sound and has 
promised to clean some 364 miles of coastline by sept 15 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on 
march 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude from the 
transalaska pipeline more than 10 million gallons of oil poured 
into the sound

eight carnivalgoers trapped in a broken super 
loop ride were rescued sunday after being left dangling upside 
down and 60 feet in the air for more than two hours 
apparently a light fixture had shaken loose and had come down 
on the tracks and jammed when the little train came by it was 
stopped said fire department spokesman john mulligan 
the ride in queens which was part of a traveling carnival and 
consists of connecting train cars that run on a hoopshaped track 
ground to a halt late saturday at the top of the loop leaving the 
eight thrillseekers screaming for help 
after a while the trapped riders tiring of being upside down 
unbuckled their seat belts and sat on the safety cage surrounding 
the seats rescue workers feared it might not hold their weight 
mulligan said 
around 1215 am after about 2 hours firefighters using a 
cherry picker were able to take the passengers off the crippled 
ride two at a time he said 
no one was seriously injured but two riders were taken to 
peninsula general hospital for treatment for exposure mulligan 
said

some foreign observers of panamas 
presidential election said sunday they saw no evidence of voting 
irregularities despite opposition predictions of fraud but others 
were less flattering 
they the government tried to put on a nice play but it 
wasnt shakespeare said jurgen koch a west german observer 
invited by panamas human rights commission 
former president jimmy carter invited by the panamanian 
government appeared satisfied with the voting process the only 
problem ive seen is with the number of voters he said 
referring to the long lines of voters as he visited polls at the 
torrijoscarter elementary school in the sprawling dusty 
workingclass suburb of san miguelito 
he said there had been complaints in some precincts about 
ballots arriving late but ive checked with the opposition and 
the government representatives at the polls and they dont seem 
to have any problems at the places where ive been 
sen john mccain rariz part of an univited 13member 
delegation sent by president bush said his group had seen 
irregularities 
the general belief is that the election will be stolen 
sometime tonight mccain said as polls closed at 5 pm 
weve seen many irregularities but it is difficult to judge 
the extent of the irregularities he said 
the bush delegation arrived saturday apparently traveling under 
temporary duty orders from the us department of defense 
the panamanian government had said the delegation was not 
welcome and would not be issued visas but election officials 
allowed the group to visit polling places 
koch echoed complaints by pollwatchers from the opposition 
christian democratic party that hundreds of voters had been 
instructed to go to certain voting stations in precincts known to 
favor the opposition only to get there and be told they were not 
registered 
panama tolerated observers but did not let them get to close 
to the action koch said 
carter was greeted in san miguelito by cheering crowds of voters 
who yelled viva jimmy and we love you very much jimmy 
carter 
the elementary school is named after the 1977 treaties under 
which the united states is to hand over the panama canal to panama 
at the end of the century carter and omar torrijos the late 
panamanian dictator signed the treaties 
carter headed an observer delegation that included former 
president gerald ford he visited more than a half dozen voting 
places around panama city 
bush delegation leader rep john murtha dpa said he saw no 
signs of irregularities but guards had threatened to remove a costa 
rican observer from polls at one precinct near the capital for 
allegedly being too close 
murtha said the attempt was shouted down by opposition voters 
people feel very strongly about this election it is going to 
be difficult to have a fraudulent election and overcome what the 
polls indicate he said 
published polls gave opposition candidate guillermo endara a 
2to1 edge over progovernment candidate carlos duque 
the opposition while welcoming the observers predicted the 
election would be rigged 
it said the government issued duplicate voting cards to some 
panamanians allowing them to vote more than once and planned a 
fraudulent computer vote count 
luis felipe romero a mexican observer invited like koch by 
the panamanian human rights commission said its all quiet so 
far 
he and other observers were told by the rights commission to 
stay 100 feet or so from the nearest booth to avoid the appearance 
of interference 
manuel burgos an opposition spokesman claimed that five costa 
rican observers were detained saturday night in chitre province 
interrogated and had their luggage searched they were released 
sunday morning he said

the coast guard was waiting for better 
weather sunday before attempting to rescue 41 people stranded on a 
bering sea island after their skiff capsized in rough seas 
crew members from the crabprocessing ship coastal star were 
stranded on st matthew island after leaving their ship for a 
beachcombing trip friday coast guard spokesman fritz richter said 
the ship the 320foot coastal star is anchored an undetermined 
distance off st matthew island which is about 425 miles north of 
the aleutian islands 
the 66 crew members stil aboard the ship floated survival suits 
food and radios to the island to held their stranded colleagues 
survive their first night 
on saturday a c130 aircraft dispatched from the coast guard 
base at kodiak dropped tents food warm clothing sleeping bags 
and fuel to the island where it was snowing richter said 
they are safe for the time being and i think relatively 
comfortable he said sunday they were able to build a fire 
as they waited for calmer weather the coast guard cutter 
jarvis crew patrolled the islands north coast looking for a 
stretch of beach on which to land a flatbottomed rescue vessel 
winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet had prevented vessels 
from providing help on friday and saturday 
richter said he assumed the skiff had been ferrying small groups 
of crew members to the island when the craft capsized tossing an 
undetermined number of people into the icy water but he said the 
passengers were close enough to swim to shore and there were no 
reports of injuries or hypothermia 
the crew members are workers aboard the fish processor 
i have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like 
this coast guard spokesman greg robinson said in juneau 
the coastal star which can carry 120 people is based in 
petersburg alaska and owned by icicle seafoods of seattle no one 
answered the telephone at icicle seafoods on sunday

gasoline prices jumped nearly two cents a 
gallon in the past two weeks as wholesalers passed on rising costs 
and took advantage of rising demand an industry analyst said 
sunday 
the national average retail price for all grades of gasoline 
including taxes was 11738 cents per gallon may 5 trilby lundberg 
said 
that figure was up 195 cents per gallon over the price reported 
in the april 21 survey of 12000 stations nationwide 
average prices at selfserve stations which comprise most 
sales were 10660 cents per gallon for regular leaded 10813 for 
regular unleaded and 12319 for premium unleaded 
fullserve prices were 13008 for regular leaded 13239 for 
regular unleaded and 14396 for premium unleaded 
the jump was far smaller than the approximate 10 cents per 
gallon hike last month after the valdez oil spill temporarily 
cinched oil supplies but consumers who expected a price break were 
disappointed ms lundberg said 
a great deal of the prices weve seen in recent weeks has been 
directly related to the rising price of crude oil which has 
risen by several dollars a gallon she said 
prices also were affected by increased demand and by changes in 
gasoline composition mandated by the us environmental protection 
agency to make gas less volatile during hot summer months ms 
lundberg said 
prices could rise even faster and go significantly higher as 
summer demand goes up ms lundberg said 
but she said that was by no means certain because the seasonal 
demand which peaks in july or august is mitigated by increased 
competition

one of space shuttle atlantis main 
computers quit sunday and although it came back on line ground 
controllers had the astronauts install a spare for mondays 
critical reentry and landing 
the flight crew dropped all other jobs to concentrate on the 
4hour job of installing the spare 
when the astronauts finished mission control communicator tammy 
jernigan radioed we send our congratulations good work this is 
the first time such a changeout has ever taken place in orbit 
the extra work forced the crew members to delay their sleep 
period by an hour 
atlantis has four operating computers one backup and one spare 
they control and monitor all spacecraft systems and actually fly 
the shuttle most of the time atlantis could land monday with only 
one computer operating if necessary 
flight director ron dittemore said the loss of the computer 
posed no threat to the mission 
we just dont have the confidence to run with it for entry 
he told reporters 
shuttle commander david walker told mission control it looks 
like gpc4 has failed he was directed to switch on general 
purpose computer no 3 the spare 
walker then restored no 4 to operation it seems to be 
working he reported 
after ground experts determined there was a hardware problem 
they decided to take no chances with the unit and ordered the spare 
installed in no 4s place 
well terminate all the experiments and get at it walker 
said dropped were one sample run in a materials processing furnace 
and photographs being taken of lightning and polluted areas on 
earth 
dittemore said computer no 4s reactivation indicated the 
failure was temporary 
there might be something floating in there that caused a 
short he said we just know we dont want to trust it 
the failure had no impact on the the flight said mission 
control commentator billie deeson the vehicle continues to 
perform normally 
walker and pilot ronald grabe checked shuttle systems sunday 
making sure they were ready for the hourlong plunge from 184 miles 
up through the atmosphere monday landing is scheduled for 1243 
pm pdt at edwards air force base in the mojave desert 
cbs nbc and cable news network plan to provide live coverage 
monday of the landing of the space shuttle atlantis abcs coverage 
plans were incomplete sunday 
earlier walker had reported atlantis was performing flawlessly 
and that the magellan spacecraft a robot probe the crew launched 
on a flight to venus was operating without a hitch 
if atlantis flight continues as well as it has id sure give 
it a 10 on my personal scale walker said you couldnt ask for 
a better flying machine 
the shuttle commander was answering questions beamed up from 
reporters at the johnson space center in houston 
walker remarked that the magellan launch was significant because 
it shows the human race is continuing its exploration of the 
solar system 
magellan was more than a halfmillion miles from earth on sunday 
on its 15month journey to cloudshrouded venus and project 
scientists said all its systems were working well venus was more 
than 158 million miles away 
when magellan reaches venus in august 1990 it is to fire into 
orbit about the planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface with 
a high resolution radar system 
astronaut norman thagard told reporters that the images obtained 
by the 550 million magellan project should tell scientists not 
only about the history of venus but also about the evolution of its 
sister planet earth 
he noted that venus shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds and a 
carbon dioxide atmosphere has a runaway greenhouse effect that has 
resulted in surface temperatures of 900 degrees fahrenheit 
many scientists fear that earth is warming up and may experience 
a severe greenhouse effect itself sometime in the future to help 
prevent that happening thagard said we need to know the 
mechanisms whereby these things occur 
the edwards forecast called for favorable weather with high 
scattered clouds and visibility of seven miles 
nasa expected a relatively small crowd of 100000 on hand for 
the landing spokeswoman nancy lovato said atlantis wasnt expected 
to draw as many people as some past shuttle flights because it is 
landing on a weekday an estimated 460000 people watched discovery 
touch down march 18 a saturday 
mission specialists mary cleave mark lee and thagard began 
packing up and stowing equipment and experiments as the fourday 
orbital journey neared an end 
the workload was limited because the magellan probe and its 
rocket booster which together weighed 45000 pounds did not allow 
for many experiments to be carried aboard 
cleave said the light workload enabled her to concentrate more 
time on a materials processing furnace where she melted and 
resolidified small samples of a metal called indium to see how the 
process works in weightlessness 
its been working perfectly and we hope to bring back some 
good indium crystals she said 
potential applications for such spacemade materials include 
advanced electronic and optical devices devoid of the contamination 
that occurs naturally during processing in earths gravity 
most of the other experiments involved photography of polluted

jogger to ease their suffering and has visited the victim and her 
family several times 
it was clear that she and her family were suffering so much 
oconnor said of the victim and her parents 
but the roman catholic leader said he felt compelled to also 
reach out to the suspects families 
i realized that the families of those boys would be suffering 
and i would make myself available to do anything that i could do to 
help them oconnor said outside st patricks cathedral 
oconnor said he wrote the parents of the six youths accused in 
the april 19 attack and told them that i was available to assist 
in any way that i could without entering into the judicial 
process 
oconnor said he subsequently met with five of the boys at 
spofford juvenile center in the bronx and with the sixth suspect at 
the rikers island jail it was not clear when the visits took place 
oconnor said he walked away with a great sense of sadness 
after his visit with the boys and described the park attack as a 
complex nightmare 
those kids their lives will have to be changed whatever 
happens to them by way of the judicial process and the families 
they must be traumatized he said 
the victim a28yearold wall street investment banker was 
attacked while jogging after dark along her usual route in central 
park she was beaten raped and left for dead in a mud puddle and 
spent two weeks in a coma police said 
she emerged from a coma last week and was in critical and 
stable condition on sunday hospital officials said 
oconnor said he deliberately avoided talking about the attack 
with the suspects and spoke in general terms to the boys 
i talked the kind of thing that one talks with lads who are 
confined under those circumstances oconnor said where are 
you in school where are you in the family how many kids in your 
family 
he said the boys were glad to see him and asked him to return 
oconnor said he planned to meet with some of the boys parents

panamanians voted for a new president 
sunday in an election fraught with charges of fraud and us 
interference and some foreign observers complained of voting 
irregularities 
the election seen as a referendum on the de facto rule of gen 
manuel antonio noriega pitted carlos duque handpicked by 
noriega against guillermo endara the candidate of an opposition 
coalition 
the triumph of the opposition is indisputable endara said 
after polls closed at 5 pm 6 pm edt but before any results 
had been announced he called for a march monday to safeguard the 
results 
although endara cited no figures the opposition released an 
exit poll claiming that 551 percent of 1022 voters said they had 
chosen endara and 395 percent said they had voted for duque 
in the only reported incident of violence the roman catholic 
church said a dutch priest was shot and seriously wounded by 
soldiers as he urged people over a loudspeaker to go to the polls 
in the western city of david 
voters began lining up at some polling stations at 5 am two 
hours before the scheduled opening at one booth more than 100 of 
348 registered voters were in line by 8 am by late afternoon the 
lines were gone 
the government promised official results within 24 hours after 
closing time 
the opposition accused the government of making arrangements for 
its supporters to vote early and often and said they feared the 
election would be stolen as votes were tallied at the election 
tribunal 
opposition leaders pointed out that the 15000 members of 
noriegas defense forces were allowed to jump to the front of 
voting lines and they could vote at any booth making multiple 
voting possible 
they said hundreds of opposition supporters who went to the san 
juan bautista de la salle college to vote were told they were not 
registered to do so the college is in a wealthy panama city 
district 
sen john mccain rariz part of a 13member uninvited 
delegation sent by president bush said the general belief is 
that the election will be stolen sometime tonight 
weve seen many irregularities but it is difficult to judge 
the extent of the irregularities he said 
they tried to put on a nice play but it wasnt shakespeare 
said jurgen koch a west german observer invited by panamas human 
rights commission 
former president jimmy carter however said he had seen no 
irregularities the only problem ive seen is with the number of 
voters he said referring to the long lines of voters 
he said there had been complaints in some precincts about 
ballots arriving late but ive checked with the opposition and 
the government representatives at the polls and they dont seem 
to have any problems at the places where ive been 
carter was invited by the panamanian government along with 
former president gerald ford 
daniel nunez the roman catholic bishop of david said that rev 
nicolas van cleef was arrested inside a car by the defense forces 
while urging a high voter turnout and criticizing fraud over a car 
loudspeaker 
van cleef was shot while inside the car and was listed in 
grave condition the church said telephone calls to government 
spokesmen for comment were not returned 
the government contends the opposition has joined forces with 
the united states in an effort to abrogate the 1977 panama canal 
treaties which call for the united states to give the canal to 
panama on dec 31 1999 
as proof duque pointed to damaging us economic sanctions 
us drug charges against noriega and reports that the united 
states provided the opposition with 10 million in campaign 
assistance 
the opposition denies the government charges and says noriega 
must be eased out as commander of the panamanian defense forces if 
democracy is to progress in panama 
duque and acting president manuel solis palma received a mixture 
of boos and cheers when they voted 
endara 52 and duque 59 are both businessmen a new president 
takes office sept 1 
a progovernment newspaper la republica published official 
election tribunal figures showing progovernment parties with 
611000 registered members out of 118 million registered voters 
opposition vicepresidential candidate ricardo arias calderon 
issued a statement saying he had not the slightest doubt that 
there will be fraud he was one of the leaders calling for a 
protest march monday 
arias calderon repeated accusations that the electoral register 
included 100000 duplicate names and that out of a sampling of 
3000 recent deaths the names of 27 percent of the dead were still 
on the register 
several voters told reporters they had checked to make sure dead 
or absent relatives were stricken from the voting list 
thats two less votes they can steal said lilia shaw after 
making sure officials crossed off the names of her brother and 
father both out of the country 
noriegas hold over the defense forces has given him effective 
control of the government since 1983 and he has been able to 
remove presidents at will 
in the last election in 1984 nicolas ardito barletta was 
narrowly elected over arnulfo arias madrid amid cries of fraud 
noriega had barletta resign and installed eric delvalle as 
president in 1985 
when delvalle tried to fire noriega in february 1988 after the 
general was indicted in the united states on drug charges noriega 
engineered delvalles ouster and installed solis palma as acting 
president 
noriega denies the drug charges

the coast guard on sunday rescued 41 
sailors stranded on a bering sea island for two days after their 
skiff capsized in rough seas officials said 
crew from the coast guard cutter jarvis used a raft and a small 
boat to shuttle the sailors from st matthew island to their crab 
processing ship after harsh weather subsided coast guard lt jeff 
merrell 
all of those rescued were in good condition merrell said 
the crab processing ship the 320foot coastal star was 
anchored off the island about 425 miles north of the aleutian 
islands 
the sailors were stranded on the island friday after leaving the 
ship for a beachcombing trip coast guard spokesman fritz richter 
said 
the 66 crew members still aboard the ship floated survival 
suits food and radios to the island to held their stranded 
colleagues survive their first night 
on saturday a c130 aircraft dispatched from the coast guard 
base at kodiak dropped tents food warm clothing sleeping bags 
and fuel to the island where it was snowing richter said 
winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet prevented vessels from 
providing help on friday and saturday

of crew members to the island when the craft capsized tossing an 
undetermined number of people into the icy water but he said the 
passengers were close enough to swim to shore and there were no 
reports of injuries or hypothermia 
the crew members are workers aboard the fish processor 
i have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like 
this coast guard spokesman greg robinson said in juneau 
the coastal star which can carry 120 people is based in 
petersburg alaska and owned by icicle seafoods of seattle no one 
answered the telephone at icicle seafoods on sunday

boeing co says it will sell up to 502 million 
worth of 747 jumbo jets to south africa in a deal which drew strong 
criticism from members of the states congressional delegation 
the aircraft maker based here and south african transport 
minister eli louw in johannesburg said in separate announcements 
saturday south african airways would buy two boeing 747400 jets 
for 256 million the planes are to be delivered in november 1990 
and may 1991 
the governmentowned airline also has options for two more 
aircraft which would be delivered in 1992 for another 256 million 
sen brock adams dwash is violently opposed to the sale 
said spokeswoman barbara smith he finds it very inappropriate 
house majority leader tom foley dwash said in spokane he 
thinks boeing officials know there are strong feelings in the 
united states and seattle about south africas system of apartheid 
or racial segregation 
foley said he had a forthright talk with boeing commercial 
airplanes president dean thornton who told him that boeing has a 
longstanding policy to sell its planes without regard to foreign 
policy as long as the sale is legal 
us policies do not prohibit such sales to south africa boeing 
shareholders recently voted down a stockholderproposed measure 
that would have prohibited doing business with south africa 
boeing has no office employees or investments in south africa 
said boeing commercial airplanes spokesman dick schleh 
the boeing company markets to airlines throughout the world so 
long as theyre countries the us government permits sales to be 
made in schleh said when it comes to the question of whether 
aircraft should be sold in a particular country its a decision 
best made by the us government 
rep jim mcdermott a democrat whose district includes boeing 
opposes the sale and is a sponsor of a resolution to increase trade 
sanctions against south africa 
mike williams mcdermotts staff director said friday that 
boeing told mcdermott earlier in the week that a sale was being 
negotiated 
ive come back to seattle to try to meet with them and see 
whats going on and why williams said representative 
mcdermott has expressed in no uncertain terms that he is opposed to 
the sale 
at this point there is no specific violation of the 1986 
antiapartheid act because it appears to be a commercial sale 
said ms smith sen adams spokeswoman but that does not excuse 
the boeing company from taking an insensitive position 
the antiapartheid act prohibits the sale of some technology to 
south africa that could be used by the government or military 
this is considered a commercial transaction schleh said 
boeing has sold 53 airliners to south african airways the last 
one was delivered in 1983

alabamas billboard confronts one of michigans 
greatest concentrations of influential businesses catching the eye 
like a red flag on the i94 automation alley thoroughfare 
linking detroit and ann arbor 
detroit start your engines alabama is open for business 
it reads 
the alabama development office alabama corporations and 
communities help pay for billboards such as that one in cities 
ranging from st louis to new york spokesman robert sutton said 
visits from alabama emissaries follow in search of more 
industries like huntsvilles high technology and computer 
companies birminghams medical research facilities and forest 
products enterprises statewide sutton said 
michigan officials try to lure companies and travelers by 
advertising in other states too but they arent heading for 
alabama with banjos billboards or any other direct counterattack 
we dont do billboards weve never felt it would necessarily 
do the job for us said al sandner of the touristseeking state 
travel bureau 
there will also be no bama billboard battle by the state 
manufacturing development group which goes after new offices and 
plants marketing unit director jeff mason said 
as opposed to going into a number of different states we have 
targeted particular industries mason said then we have 
searched out the most rapidly growing industries in those 
categories 
masons department spends 3 million a year on advertising to 
lure business to michigan sandners agency spends 45 million to 
draw tourists 
battling back neighoring wisconsin illinois indiana ohio and 
ontario province in canada are familiar advertisers for tourists in 
michigan as well as southerly destinations like kentucky 
tennessee florida and texas 
michigan spends its tourist ad money on television magazine 
newspaper supplement and radio ads in many of those same states 
sandner said it attracts most of its tourists from the chicago 
area 
when summer simmers alabama as well as florida georgia 
mississippi louisiana and arkansas are ideal targets for magazine 
spreads showing rippling waters and golf greens that stay green 
well use a fourcolor photo of some spectacular great lakes 
scene water scenes and hint that the water goes on forever the 
subliminal message being when july and august get to be too much in 
central florida come on up to our peninsulas and cool off he 
said 
when michigan wants to bag businesses it doesnt aim at 
neighbors mason said 
our posture has been not to go robbing peter to pay paul 
ultimately you end up redistributing the number of businesses 
between the two states and really not increasing the amount of 
business activity 
youre just capturing one for the one that left he said 
were looking to expand the ones that are here and capture the 
ones looking at new locations

the family of the man who founded the 
walmart stores inc discount chain wants to restructure the way 
they hold company stock which could result in substantial tax 
benefits according to the companys proxy report 
the walton family members now hold 218 million walmart shares 
worth about 77 billion as owners of a delaware corporation 
called walton enterprises that actually holds the stock the 
individual waltons company founder sam walton and his four 
children s robson john t jim c and alice l own roughly 
equal shares of walton enterprises 
the recently released walmart proxy report says the family has 
proposed to hold ownership of the walmart shares through a 
partnership instead of a corporation the report said family 
members may obtain very substantial future tax advantages by 
changing their holding method to a partnership 
to do that the waltons have proposed an exchange of stock with 
walmart stores provided that there is a tax ruling that the 
exchange itself would not be taxed the walmart board has named a 
committee of its independent directors to review the proposed 
exchange and negotiate its terms 
little rock tax lawyer george plastiras said tax laws would 
apply differently to walmart stock held in a partnership instead 
of through a corporation if there later is a distribution of the 
stock to individual partners upon dissolution of the partnership 
or to walton enterprises stockholders if it were dissolved as a 
corporation 
they can dissolve the partnership in a nontaxable event 
plastiras said 
woody whyte an analyst for the little rock investment banking 
firm staephens inc said the proposal has nothing to do with the 
walmart company as such the waltoncontrolled stock still 
would be controlled by the waltons he said

they know their efforts could be wiped out by the 
liquidation of their company or a housecleaning by a new owner but 
a group of eastern employees is keeping up a skeleton operation at 
the strikebound carrier 
its a risk but i happen to believe in what were doing so 
its a risk you take said bob tripp explaining why he has 
stayed with eastern despite its uncertain future 
tripp was mopping floors friday as the strike by easterns 
machinists pilots and flight attendants entered its third month 
the 23year eastern employee wearing the grimed workclothes is 
normally manager of internal distribution 
this is management development 101 he said im doing all 
the things i usually supervise from my whitecollar job 
with 4500 employees down from nearly 30000 before the strike 
eastern workers are averaging 10 to 12 hours a day without extra 
compensation and most have several sets of duties the carrier is 
flying about 10 percent of its prestrike schedule 
texas air corp which owns eastern is hoping a us bankruptcy 
court judge will approve a plan that provides for the sale of 18 
billion in assets leaving a smaller reorganized carrier staffed 
by nonunion workers 
easterns unions say the carrier which filed for reorganization 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code after the strike 
began should be sold to one of several prospective buyers who have 
until may 10 to submit bids 
some independent analysts have said eastern should be liquidated 
but the remaining eastern workers want to see their company pull 
through 
chapter 11 its the first chapter of the rest of your life 
proclaim posters throughout the carriers headquarters and its 
shops at miami international airport 
eastern will survive other signs promise 
smaller handwritten signs taped to bathroom doors remind 
employees that there are no paid cleaners anymore so each employee 
must help keep things clean 
few people are doing only their normal prestrike jobs 
bob wolf the domestic advertising manager was in overalls 
friday working in the wheels and brakes department he also helps 
pack the liquor kits for flights 
nearby two computer programmers were repairing plane tires 
cira tellechea an area sales manager was welding an aluminum 
patch onto a plane part 
on friday eastern averaged 71 passengers on its 110 or so daily 
flights less than onethird capacity for many of its planes 
but the airlines remaining workers point to stellar ontime 
rates of 965 percent and reduced complaints about lost bags and 
other passenger problems 
its a piece of cake no sweat at all said leo ouellette a 
supervisor at systems control where dispatchers monitor the 
locations of all of easterns planes and crews with 110 flights 
a day when were used to 1000 or more things are very efficient 
eastern is getting ready to add more flights with 264 new 
pilots in training and interviews scheduled with 270 more this 
week the company took out newspapers ads sunday to hire new 
mechanics and the first new flight attendants began training last 
week and schools for 56 each in miami and atlanta will probably 
begin this week
