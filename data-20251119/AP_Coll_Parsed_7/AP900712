two men were charged late thursday with 
murder in connection with the slaying of a wesleyan university 
student activist who police said had joined with them in a drug 
distribution ring 
carl lightner 20 and kumar viswanathan 21 were charged with 
murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the death 
of nicholas b haddad who was found fatally shot in a car carrying 
a cache of semiautomatic weapons 
lightner has been in custody since he was arrested july 7 on an 
unrelated drug charge he was to be arrested and arraigned on the 
murder charges friday bond on those charges was set at 550000 
viswanathan was still at large late thursday police said but a 
hartford superior court judge set his bond at 750000 authorities 
said they believe viswanathan has fled hartford 
police said haddad and the two suspects had set up a drug 
distribution center in hartford haddad supplied the cash and the 
other men bought and sold the drugs police said 
haddad was to receive a share of profits from sales made by the 
other two the two suspects reportedly lost or misspent a large sum 
of haddads money and fearing reprisal plotted to kill him 
police said 
haddad was lured to keney park in hartford on july 6 and shot to 
death police said 
his participation in protests against the treatment of 
minorities at wesleyan and his recent purchases of semiautomatic 
weapons had led authorities to wonder if the slaying was connected 
to two firebombings at wesleyan in april but authorities no longer 
think that is the case 
hartford states attorney john m bailey said police found 
absolutely no connection between the murder and activities on 
the wesleyan campus bailey also said there was no sign that the 
slaying was racially motivated 
haddad 21 a lebaneseamerican who had spent about 17 years in 
lebanon identified with the black community at wesleyan during 
the spring black students complained that police had unfairly 
singled out haddad and several other minority group members as 
suspects in the firebombings 
police denied having any suspects although a hartford courant 
reporter visiting the middletown police station reported seeing 
memorandums posted identifying three students as principal suspects 
family members said they were just as puzzled as police over 
what happened 
in a eulogy at a funeral mass on wednesday haddads cousin 
also named nicholas haddad said his slain cousin had wanted to 
embrace the person he had become not the person we wanted him to 
be 
we all worried about him in the end said the cousin he did 
not elaborate 
when haddads body was found police said they recovered an 
undisclosed number of semiautomatic weapons from the car including 
an israelimade uzi he bought for 1000 
all were legally purchased last month from a gun shop three 
miles from the campus of wesleyan an elite private university with 
an enrollment of 2700 
police said his interest in firearms had become an obsession 
in the past month 
reggie cann a wesleyan graduate student said he and haddad 
were both members of a support group for black students 
he considered himself african cann said 
he liked to live a mysterious life and it was hard to tell 
when he was telling the truth said one former wesleyan student 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
haddad who listed red hook ny as his home address was 
coeditor of a new student publication called the afrikan nation 
and had helped organize several rallies this spring protesting the 
treatment of minorities at wesleyan and around the world 
the cover of the publications first edition said in creative 
struggle the embrace of love and war will give birth to the new 
afrikan nation 
haddad and nine other students went on a nineday hunger strike 
in may following the discovery of racist graffiti in the basement 
of a black student dormitory 
the activists said the graffiti was the product of a climate of 
racial intolerance at wesleyan 
haddad had been notified in june that because of academic 
deficiencies he would have to take at least two semesters off 
before being considered for readmission the university said he 
had however remained in the area after the end of the school year 
university officials had only last semester named haddad a 
mellon fellow a fellowship intended to encourage top minority 
students to pursue careers as professors

the government has decided that hundreds of 
soviet jews seeking asylum in east germany can stay although they 
entered the country with tourist visas rather than the required 
residency permits 
the decision wednesday ends weeks of uncertainty for nearly 400 
soviet jews who have settled in east germany since april 
interior ministry spokesman achim hildebrandt said however 
that the thousands of romanians who have been flooding into east 
germany will be considered for asylum only on a casebycase basis 
east germany now on the threshold of uniting with wealthy west 
germany has turned into a magnet for asylumseekers from other 
eastern european nations facing a bleaker economic future

the sun sets in the east in hospital 
room no 25 at stanford university medical center where heart 
transplant patients are more used to medical miracles than natural 
wonders 
the reversed sunset actually is the work of photographer joey 
fischer who installed three fake windows in the hospitals cardiac 
unit to comply with a state law that requires all rooms to have 
windows 
dr patricia chase who approved the deal for the state said 
she did so to save scarce hospital space for cardiac patients she 
called the fake window an innovative approach although she 
agreed it wasnt a window by strict definition

president bush testily rebutting criticism that 
he lacks environmental commitment said he wasnt looking for a 
brownie point when he and his economic summit partners issued 
an environmental statement which left conservation groups 
disappointed 
we cannot govern by listening to the loudest voice on the 
extreme of an environmental movement bush told a news conference 
after being accused of inaction on global warming and a weak 
overall environmental declaration 
environmental groups were ready with critical statements 
wednesday when the seven leaders of industrialized economic summit 
nations released their communique 
the sierra club accused the leaders of hiding inaction on global 
warming behind a figleaf on rain forests even though the summit 
pledged to work for a major international program to fight 
deforestation 
the envirosummit coalition of prominent environmental 
organizations blasted the leaders disunity and inaction and 
wilderness society president george frampton said bush had lulled 
the other leaders into an environmental sleep that abandons their 
commitment to advance solutions to the worlds most pressing 
ecological problems 
asked for a response bush told a news conference look im 
not going to respond to those groups that have been attacking us 
every time we turn around on the environmental extreme they 
dont want this country to grow they dont want to take the look 
down the road at the human consequence of men and women thrown out 
of work and families put into a whole new state of anxiety 
in an uncharacteristic attack on environmental groups bush 
continued and i did not rely heavily on them for support in 
getting elected president of the united states and im not going 
to be persuaded that i can get some brownie point by appealing to 
one of these groups or other 
bush during his presidential campaign repeatedly asserted i 
am an environmentalist 
as president he has invited environmental activists to present 
their points of view at the white house but the environmental 
groups have grown disenchanted with the access complaining that he 
has dragged his feet on environmental action and policies 
bush appointed a respected environmental leader william reilly 
as administrator of the environmental protection agency but reilly 
was not among the highranking officials who accompanied the 
president to the economic summit 
the summit declaration sidestepped divisive global warming 
issues and instead emphasized forestry protection 
the seven leaders pledged to negotiate an international 
agreement on ways to curb deforestation as expeditiously as 
possible and promised to complete the plan by 1992 
the global warming language was general and called for an 
international convention on the subject also to be completed by 
1992 the united nations is already working on the issue 
the bush administration quashed european efforts to impose 
specific reduction goals on carbon dioxide emissions seen as a 
major cause of global warming 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said germany had wanted 
tougher language on greenhouse gas emissions but added we can 
live with the communique 
bush told his news conference that we came out with a 
reasoned position not a radical position thats going to throw a 
lot of american men and women out of jobs

hollywood executives werent commenting 
wednesday on allegations that the entertainment industry is run by 
jews who discriminate against blacks one insider said responding 
could only hurt 
studio executives at 20th century fox paramount pictures 
columbia pictures universal pictures and the walt disney co 
declined to comment on the charges leveled tuesday at the annual 
convention of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
one studio executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
responding would be a nowin situation 
marla gibbs a producer and star of the nbc sitcom 227 said 
tuesday during a workshop at the convention i think were all 
talking about film distribution and marketing based on how the 
jewish people and the other people set it up it was not set up for 
us so we have a problem we have to use what we have 
nbc spokeswoman susan binford would not respond to the 
allegations made at the naacp gathering but said nbc is 
constantly striving to produce a balance of views and people and 
issues 
a number of naacp delegates said they agreed blacks have been 
discriminated against in the entertainment industry and elsewhere 
but none interviewed wednesday singled out the jewish community 
for criticism 
i think we as minorities need to pull together said wanda 
woods a delegate from texas i think we should fight to wipe out 
racism no matter where it is occurring until we wipe out racism 
none of us will be free 
naacp convention delegate legrand clegg a lawyer for the city 
of compton said tuesday that black leaders should call a summit 
meeting with the hollywood jewish community in the same spirit that 
jews have called for summits on statements by nation of islam 
leader louis farrakhan 
if jewish leaders can complain of black antisemitism our 
leaders should certainly raise the issue of the centuryold problem 
of jewish racism in hollywood said clegg 
some suggested blacks should press for equal opportunity at the 
box office 
as long as blacks keep buying tickets the industry should not 
be let off the hook said sandra eversmanly president of the 
naacps beverly hillshollywood branch

first came the complimentary bart simpson 
watches then smoke and colored lights 
the buffet luncheon featured poached salmon dinner was on the 
20th century fox lot and included 300 lobsters steak free booze 
a fortune teller pool tables and pinball machines 
this is the curious phenomenon known as the annual summer press 
tour every year about this time the major broadcast and cable 
networks pull out all the stops and unabashedly wine and dine the 
nations tv critics 
for two weeks tv writers from around the country converge on 
the century plaza hotel for a nonstop hype food and drink fest 
compliments of abc nbc cbs home box office ted turner pbs 
espn name a television programmer and theyre probably there 
the purpose of this exercise is to give television writers from 
say peoria a chance to see network stars and business types up 
close besides gorging the critics with food booze and gifts the 
reporters also are stuffed with quotes interviews pilot 
screenings press releases photographs and fall schedules 
fox broadcasting co started this summers tour on tuesday at 9 
am 200plus critics notebooks and bart watches in hand sat 
down for eight hours of talk 
first there was the smoke and swirling colored lights that was 
followed by the announcement of foxs longawaited childrens 
network and its 5 hours of kiddie programming thanks to a 
recently acquired waiver from the federal communications 
commission it allows fox to increase its programming hours for one 
year without complying with regulations that bar the big three 
networks from lucrative domestic syndication markets 
fox entertainment group president peter chernin talked about the 
networks heady success with the simpsons and married 
with children both of which shot into nielsens top five list 
this summer for the first time in foxs young history 
said fox president jamie kellner weve had a year that can 
only be described as breathtaking 
if we do say so ourselves 
the wisdom of moving the simpsons to thursday nights this 
fall was a muchdiscussed topic beginning in october the 
animated smartaleck simpsons will go headtohead with the 
unanimated genteel huxtables of nbcs the cosby show 
sooner or later the cosby show is going to have to come 
down chernin said clearly theres a risk involved but taking 
risks is what this networks about 
indeed almost every speech by chernin contains the word 
guerrilla which he likes to use to describe foxs approach to 
taking on nbc cbs and abc 
fox also likes to use the word counterprogramming 
were not interested in taking on the big guys in what they do 
best chernin said 
despite foxs unprecedented success some of its 
counterprograms just didnt work no matter how much publicity 
they received 
alien nation and 21 jump street for example both got 
the ax for the fall 
alien nation a scifi serial about nonthreatening space 
aliens with funny looking heads had a man giving birth last 
season we had viewers sampling it chernin said but the 
audience just wasnt there 
as for 21 jump street which made a heartthrob star out of 
johnny depp chernin said the cast was getting too old to support 
the programs plot line of high school undercover cops 
fox also spent much time promoting its new expanded fall 
schedule that jumps to five nights of primetime programs again 
thanks to the fcc waiver 
a lot of the ballyhoo centered on babes a raucous depiction 
of three overweight sisters that will follow the simpsons on 
thursday nights at 830 
although fox is pushing it as one of its most promising new 
shows the pilot is being reworked originally scheduled for a 
later time period some of the jokes are considered slightly 
risque for 830 pm chernin said 
some reporters wondered later whether this original script line 
will remain an office clerk looking up to find the heavyweight 
trio surrounding her desk deadpans what is this fantasia 
being risque is what fox does best or pushing the envelope 
as they like to call it nothing risque about their press tour 
however 
although its probably a safe bet that cbs press tour which 
starts this weekend wont have a fortune teller 
 
elsewhere in television at mtvs press tour on wednesday 
the music network announced that its ha comedy channel will launch 
10 new original shows this fall to complement its slate of 
standup comics and comedy reruns such as rhoda and the best 
of groucho among the original programs is comedians on 
comedy with film director paul mazursky as host he will 
interview famous and notsofamous funny people about what makes 
people laugh

for nearly 30 years of space flight nasa 
looked the other way when its highspirited astronauts tested the 
rules of behavior that governed their lives 
after all boys with the right stuff will be boisterous 
this week the space agency departed from tradition and 
suspended two veteran and highly regarded shuttle commanders for 
stepping over the line for navy cmdr robert l gibson and navy 
capt david m walker both in their mid40s the suspensions might 
be the end of their nasa careers 
there was a violation of policy donald r puddy the 
astronauts boss as director of flight operations said in an 
interview i think its clear across the board that we had 
established a policy written it down and communicated it to all 
parties involved i think they were all aware of what we were 
trying to do 
gibsons transgression was flying a stunt plane in a race at an 
air show last saturday in new braunfels texas his plane and 
another collided killing the second pilot 
walker was grounded for unspecified violation of flying rules 
the national aeronautics and space administration sought to make 
clear that his nearcollision with an airliner last year was only 
one factor that led to the suspension 
it was an incident that was considered you might say it was 
one of the more severe incidents puddy said he declined to 
elaborate saying only that the space agency had become concerned 
about some things in the manner which he was flying 
walker a navy captain who had flown in space twice was 
replaced on a defense department mission set for march 1991 and 
suspended for 60 days from flying nasas t38 jet trainers 
at the same time nasa announced a oneyear suspension for 
gibson neither astronaut had any public comment 
puddy said he had no reason to believe that dave walker is 
not going to stay with the program and no reason to believe he will 
not eventually be put back on t38 flying status he said he had 
not talked with gibson 
my personal feeling is that other members of the astronaut 
corps understand that there was a violation of policy and they also 
understand we had to take the action said puddy 
before the written guidelines nasa tolerated some dangerous 
outside activities 
gordon cooper one f the mercury seven astronauts was fond of 
fast cars and was about to make his professional driving debut when 
nasa stopped him fourtime space flyer james lovell fractured his 
arm and shoulder while skiing apollo 7 astronaut walter cunningham 
fractured a vertebra on a trampoline 
it is been just over a year since astronaut s david griggs was 
killed while performing aerial stunts in his world war iivintage 
plane practicing for a weekend air show 
when it came to space flying however nasa had a nononsense 
way of exerting discipline 
scott carpenter the fourth american in space overshot his 
landing mark by 250 miles and never got another flight he started 
a new career as an underwater researcher 
the crew of apollo 7 wally schirra donn eisele and walt 
cunningham were cranky with mission control throughout their 
11day flight all three resigned soon afterward 
astronauts david scott al worden and jim irwin smuggled some 
stamps aboard their apollo 15 planning to sell them later nasa 
found out reprimanded them and they left quickly 
puddys order bars astronauts in training for flight from taking 
part in risky recreational activities where there exists 
exposure of major or even fatal injury that includes auto 
boat airplane or motorcycle racing parachute jumping and snow 
skiing 
nasas astronaut corps has 85 members 62 of whom are in 
training for 12 future shuttle flights 
the rationale for our rules is to preserve the assigned 
crews said puddy we do not have enough people in the 
astronaut office to provide backups for every single crew member 
for all aspects of training 
gibson a threeflight veteran was considered one of nasas 
star commanders 
walker has a reputation as a hellraiser one space veteran said 
hes in the old mode of the mercury astronauts he likes flying 
fast and he likes to race people 
the national transportation safety board has not completed its 
investigation of the walker incident which occurred may 15 1989 
as he was flying his t38 to dulles international airport to take 
part in a white house ceremony 
air force col fred gregory who has been assigned to take 
walkers place on the 1991 mission said its easy for astronauts 
to stray from the rules 
all of us are pilots and all of us are very aggressive 
pilots gregory said its sometimes difficult for us to 
separate our outside activities and our piloting skills and just 
the thrill of flying its unfortunate in this particular case

youre a legislator facing tough decisions 
bound to be controversial sure to set barn fires no matter how you 
decide 
then someone has a bright idea let the people decide put the 
issue on the ballot and put the question to the people what could 
be more democratic 
is that buckpassing 
or is it direct participatory democracy 
yes it is and yes it is said patrick b mcguigan an oklahoman 
who has been keeping track of ballot propositions at the 
conservative free congress foundation for years 
yes said mcguigan when legislatures put issues on the ballot 
it becomes a way for legislators to avoid doing what we elect 
them to do 
and yes said mcguigan it is an expression of confidence in 
ourselves he said it makes citizens more involved in everyday 
politics more aware of the issues 
every meaningful criticism that can be made against the 
initiative process has an exact corollary in every other aspect of 
our democratic system he said 
in any event ballot box lawmaking is a growing phenomena 
twentysix states and the district of columbia allow referendums 
issues referred to the people by the legislatures or initiatives 
issues on the ballot at the initiative of voters but only about 
a dozen states use these processes with much regularity 
in 1988 voters decided on 229 statewide issues they ranged 
from repealing a gun control law in maryland no dice said the 
voters to discouraging tobacco use by increasing cigarette taxes 
25 cents in california that passed despite a 15 million industry 
campaign against it 
this year even more issues are likely to be voted upon 
including tax limitation issues tax increases for specific 
purposes and measures to limit the terms of legislators 
you can argue for it it is direct democracy 
you can argue against it citizens are called to make decisions 
without having heard the pros and cons they dont have to consider 
priorities voting money for the homeless might take money from the 
sick or the schools they can be influenced by expensive 
advertising campaigns mounted by special interests 
thomas cronin a colorado college political scientist and author 
of direct democracy the politics of the initiative referendum 
and recall is a middleoftheroader like mcguigan he sees 
both sides 
if citizens dont know what theyre voting on legislators often 
dont either he said they pass a lot of bills in a frantic final 
burst they spend about a third of each session amending or 
otherwise repairing measures passed the previous session and they 
are influenced by political action committees lobbyists and 
special interests too 
on the other hand cronins research found that 10 to 15 percent 
of the voters who go to the polls often only 50 percent of the 
electorate do not vote on ballot issues and another 10 percent 
really dont know what theyre voting on 
so the answer is that both of these processes ought to be of 
concern he said why do we have referendums its because our 
system has become far less democratic in practice than in the 
textbooks in the ideal type of world we would not have to resort 
to initiativereferendum campaigns because we would have such 
responsible responsive legislatures they wouldnt be necessary 
cronin finds that elected officeholders scholars and 
journalists tend to be opposed to direct democracy devices they 
think the issues are too complicated that issues first should be 
aired at hearings that compromises the essence of democracy 
cant be molded by a citizen facing a yesorno choice 
the argument comes down cronin said to philosophy it is a 
case of the populists who think the people always know best vs 
parentalists who think papa knows best 
he notes that voters sometimes use the ballot to strike back at 
big government massachusetts voters vetoed both a mandatory seat 
belt law and a salary increase for state legislators one year 
mcguigan and cronin share a concern about what happens when too 
many issues crowd themselves onto the ballot in 1988 so many 
questions were on the california ballot that express lines were 
created for voters who promised to spend only five minutes marking 
their ballot 
cronin said the growth in ballot issues is a result too of the 
way incumbents have become almost undefeatable 
regular elections in america are increasingly meaningless 
he said ninetyfive percent of incumbents at the state and 
national level get reelected routinely in colorado only once in 
the 1980s did a state senator get defeated thats not untypical 
if we have no turnover no real competition then the people 
with a grievance have two choices form a pac if they have lots of 
money or get their issue on the ballot if they dont

only the swans that beg for bread on 
the banks of the neisse river seem oblivious to the fact that 
guben like berlin is a city divided by war 
for more than 700 years guben east germany and gubin poland 
were the same city but aside from a bridge that spans the neisse 
lttle else links these towns 
like germany and its old capital guben was carved in half by 
world war ii few people however are calling for the 
reunification of guben 
we wont see a united guben said juergen kunze vice mayor 
of the east german city i hardly see any contacts on a 
voluntary individual basis 
both cities today are drab gray relics of the former communist 
regimes that ruled poland and east germany until democratic 
revolutions spread through the east bloc last year 
each city stands now less as a symbol of the past than as a 
reflection of the different paths east germany and poland are 
pursuing 
both nations are experiencing high prices labor unrest and 
joblessness as the cost of dismantling their socialist systems and 
moving to the free market 
but east germany is being aided by west germany and its chances 
for achieving prosperity are expected to be far better than 
polands 
east germany merged its economy with west germanys on july 1 
and the powerful west german mark became the currency of the former 
communist country 
now better food and and higher quality household goods fill the 
stores on the east german side 
ruth hulke 55 was born on the eastern side of the river and 
was moved to the west after the war 
before east germanys borders were opened last fall she said it 
was easier for poles than east germans to travel to west germany 
poles would buy coveted goods in the west then resell them to east 
germans 
until recently she said she used to travel to the polish side 
to buy products that were not available in east germany 
now we dont need to go there any more she said 
marek dutkiwicz 25 a television repairman from the polish 
side said goods are cheaper now in east germany than in poland 
about 34000 people live in guben and 17500 poles live in the 
city across the river about 1500 poles work in the german town 
but few germans work on the other side of the river 
the original guben was chartered in the 13th century and has 
been part of prussia saxony and germany 
after germanys defeat in world war ii the allies extended the 
polish border into german lands to make up for polish territory 
ceded to the soviet union the border of the newly created east 
germany was drawn at the oder and neisse rivers 
guben which straddled the neisse was cut in two 
what was the central part of guben became part of poland and was 
renamed gubin the smaller western section of town was left for 
east germany 
most of the prewar buildings were destroyed during the war so 
there are few landmarks from the days when guben was a single 
german city 
many of the former residents fled to what is now west germany to 
escape the approaching soviet army poles from the lands seized by 
the soviets were resettled in gubin so there are few residents who 
remember the prewar days 
barbara remus an editor at the guben newspaper the lausitzer 
rundschau said there has been friction between citizens of the two 
cities 
before east germany merged its economy with west germanys 
poles would buy up statesubsidized inexpensive goods in the east 
german town and sell them in west germany at a profit 
but when the polish border was opened in february she said many 
germans from guben streamed to the polish side to buy goods 
many poles fear that a united germany will seek to reclaim its 
former lands which comprise about onethird of presentday poland 
but miss remus said there are no such stirrings in the german 
side of guben 
it used to all be one guben but its accepted that gubin is 
polish she said nobody says they want it back

at the end of last year and offered interest rates of up to 180 
percent much higher than rates at the stateoperated banks 
last year polands inflation rate was 244 percent but it has 
dropped sharply this year as the solidarityled governments 
economic shock therapy program took effect

issued by the leaders of the seven industrial nations at the 
conclusion of their 16th economic summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we discussed the situation in the soviet union and exchanged 
views regarding the message that soviet president gorbachev sent us 
several days ago on his economic plans we welcome the efforts 
underway in the soviet union to liberalize and to create a more 
open democratic and pluralistic soviet society and to move 
toward a marketoriented economy these measures deserve our 
support the success of perestroika depends upon the determined 
pursuit and development of these reform efforts in particular we 
welcome president gorbachevs suggestion for a sustained economic 
dialogue 
we have all begun individually and collectively to assist 
these reform efforts we all believe that technical assistance 
should be provided now to help the soviet union move to a 
marketoriented economy and to mobilize its own resources some 
countries are already in a position to extend large scale financial 
credits we also agreed that further soviet decisions to introduce 
more radical steps toward a marketoriented economy to shift 
resources substantially away from the military sector and to cut 
support to nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the 
prospect for meaningful and sustained economic assistance 
we have agreed to undertake in close consultation with the 
commission of the european communities a detailed study of the 
soviet economy to make recommendations for its reform and to 
establish the criteria under which western economic assistance 
could effectively support these reforms this work should be 
completed by years end and be convened by the imf international 
monetary fund

president violeta barrios de chamorro 
announced late wednesday that she would negotiate with militant 
prosandinista leaders of a general strike that has threatened to 
topple her 10weekold government 
at the same news conference gen humberto ortega head of the 
army and a member of the leftist sandinistas nineman directorate 
until march said the army would quiet the capital within hours 
i feel very sure i will serve out my term said mrs 
chamorro expressing confidence her government has survived its 
most serious challenge since defeating the sandinistas at the polls 
in february 
a wave of strikes began july 2 and turned violent when 
protesters opposing the strikes took to the streets on friday tens 
of thousands of government workers have closed down public 
services strike leaders say 90000 workers have walked out since 
the strike began 
the unions that called the strikes the army and police are all 
loyal to the sandinistas who ruled the country for nine years and 
are now the main opposition to mrs chamorros usbacked 
administration 
mrs chamorros confidence she will serve until 1995 stemmed 
from the promise of the sandinista peoples army to obey her 
command to restore order 
ortega said the army would never back a coup at the same time 
he made it clear the military would stop short of allout force 
against the strikers 
the armed forces he said will never carry out a coup against 
any government here much less the government of dona violeta but 
neither will the army and police fire on the people 
at the news conference which was attended by the us and 
soviet ambassadors and other members of the diplomatic corps mrs 
chamorro reversed her earlier insistence that the strike must end 
before talks could begin 
she said she was willing to negotiate once the streets were 
cleared of barricades basic public services were restored and 
strikers cleared from government installations 
ortega claimed the army would have managua back to nearnormal 
thursday 
he said four people had been killed and 15 to 20 wounded in 
confrontations between sandinista strikers and government 
supporters the nicaraguan human rights commission earlier 
estimated 84 injured 
police and army loyalty have been a key issue since mrs 
chamorro defeated ortegas brother daniel ortega in the feb 25 
elections 
earlier wednesday an explosion knocked a progovernment radio 
station off the air and its director blamed the sandinistas 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo said mrs chamorro called 
for public condemnation of the bombing he said the president had 
ordered a police investigation 
radio corps transmitter and antenna were blown up after 
leftist sandinista organizers told strikers to ease their grip on 
managua and demanded mrs chamorro who took office april 25 open 
negotiations immediately 
the station had been converted into a stronghold for armed 
opponents of the strikes the protesters abandoned their takeover 
at the station at tuesday midnight saying they reached an 
agreement with police 
daniel ortega had charged the station was calling on the 
government to request us military intervention to end the strikes 
no one claimed responsibility for the explosion but radio 
station director castillo osejo said in an interview he blamed 
the sandinistas because nobody else would be interested in doing 
such a thing 
the strikers are demanding more participation in economic 
planning and dispute proposals to cut back civil service workers 
hired by the sandinistas the civil servants won 100 percent pay 
raises in a may strike 
mrs chamorros coalition the 14party united national 
opposition offered the layoffs as part of a plan to restart the 
nicaraguan economy which was ruined during the 9year civil war 
with the usbacked contra rebels and a trade embargo imposed 
during the reagan administration 
meanwhile air traffic controllers went back to work wednesday 
and said the airport was open although no flights were arriving or 
departing 
a few barricades came down in the capital and gunfire ended in 
the morning but strikers still occupied most government ministries 
and some staterun industries 
the government has declared the strikes illegal it suspended 
talks over the weekend 
a statement issued by the sandinistarun national workers 
front which controls most of the striking unions urged strikers 
to create conditions favoring the start of talks allowing the 
circulation of people and transport in areas where the sandinista 
police demand it 
the statement read on prosandinista radio ya proposed that 
negotiations begin wednesday afternoon 
the day before mrs chamorro issued a statement that central 
american presidents asked that violence end to create a climate 
of calm to permit a negotiated solution 
the developments wednesday did not seem to make a major 
difference in daily life in managua although a few more people 
were in the streets 
witnesses said soldiers helped build barricades despite orders 
that they restore peace in the capital 
managua continued without public transportation most grocery 
stores remained closed barricades and trenches dug across streets 
stopped most traffic 
bomb blasts and gunfire were heard overnight but no reports of 
casualties surfaced 
state radio nicaragua claimed wednesday that a minority of 
some 3000 armed sandinistas control the city and are keeping more 
than 1 million people hostage

french president francois mitterrand an aloof figure was asked 
by reporters why he skipped the rodeo and country music bash hosted 
by bush on sunday night after all he was the only leader without 
an excuse 
chancellor helmut kohl missed the festivities because his 
country was in the finals of the world cup soccer championships and 
won 10 italian prime minister giulio andreotti as host of the 
tournament had to be on hand to present the trophy 
but why mitterrand 
because i decided on three days in houston and not four that 
is the explanation it is as simple as that the rodeo was a nice

and her quickchange artists went to work 
in 20 minutes flat they transformed a stage set with a massive 
gray dais and leather easy chairs into a familiar setting for a 
presidential news conference 
the redwhiteandblue summit insignia and the flags of the 
seven nations stayed fixed to the blue curtains as a backdrop but 
the bulky furniture was hustled away and a presidential podium 
installed 
military aides set to work with power tools bolting together 
sheets of armor plating that extended out from either side of the 
podium blue bunting concealed the protective shield 
overseeing the quick change was ms mcgill who works for 
hargrove inc a washington firm that specializes in putting on 
conventions and other events hargrove designed the summit setting 
the makeover was complete with 10 minutes to spare before bush 
returned to the hall for his postsummit news conference

when it comes to gobbling up energy there is 
no equal to uncle sam 
witnesses told two house subcommittees wednesday that since 1985 
programs by some federal agencies to conserve energy have virtually 
disappeared especially at the defense department which accounts 
for 80 percent of the governments energy requirements 
according to energy department estimates the federal government 
spent 35 billion last year to heat light and cool more than 
500000 buildings while spending only 445 million to make 
buildings more energyefficient the governments total energy bill 
came to more than 8 billion including fuels for the military 
after dramatic gains in energy efficiency in the late 1970s and 
early 80s energy use has once again been on the increase at 
federal facilities according to the government figures cited at 
the congressional hearing federal agencies used about 1 percent 
more energy per square foot of building space last year than five 
years ago between 1975 and 1985 the government cut energy use by 
17 percent 
two years ago energy conservation efforts by the government 
slowed to a crawl and continue to lag despite a law that 
requires the government to cut energy costs by 10 percent by 1995 
said rep philip sharp dind chairman of the house energy and 
power subcommittee 
comparatively few federal installations have participated in 
energy saving programs even where such programs were substantially 
financed by someone else said rep mike synar dokla who is 
chairman of the government operations subcommittee on environment 
energy and natural resources 
in recent years energy conservation has taken on renewed 
interest because of environmental concern over emissions from the 
burning of fossil fuels environmentalists have argued that the 
nation must dramatically reduce its energy use if it is to deal 
with global warming and other environmental problems 
government figures show that the defense department which spent 
more than 1 billion on energy conservation during 197585 
allocated only 15 million last year to make buildings more 
energyefficient 
jeffrey jones director of energy policy at the defense 
department said the pentagon plans soon to establish new programs 
aimed at improving energy efficiency he expressed confidence the 
10 percent energy reduction goal by 1995 can be met 
the federal government has a large stake in energy 
conservation yet the us government lags far behind the private 
sector in purchasing and installing energy conservation systems 
douglas decker manager of government markets for johnson controls 
inc told the hearing 
johnson controls inc of milwaukee wis is a major 
manufacturer of energy management systems for commercial buildings 
decker cited government figures that showed that while some federal 
agencies have reduced energy consumption per square foot others 
have increased their demand significantly 
among the agencies that have cut energy use substantially since 
1985 were the commerce department 23 percent justice department 
21 percent environmental protection agency 19 percent and 
transportation department 14 percent 
but energy use at the federal energy regulatory commission 
jumped nearly 18 percent while it rose by 11 percent at the 
general services administration and nearly 29 percent at the office 
of personnel management at the defense department by far the 
governments largest user energy use per square foot increased 14 
percent during the four years 
meanwhile a report by the general accounting office the 
investigative arm of congress cited a variety of problems in 
cutting government use of energy including budgetary concerns 
with serious deficit problems budget planners are reluctant to 
allocate money for energy efficiency improvements although the 
payback may be only a few years said gao investigator nye stevens 
but the energy savings are not possible without spending 
that additional money up front he added 
the gao also said the government lacks central direction and 
responsibility for energy conservation and that federal procurement 
practices inhibit the use of various energy conservation programs 
used by industry

marvin liebman a father of the modern 
conservative movement is helping smash gay stereotypes by publicly 
declaring his homosexuality according to gay political leaders 
i think its important not only to have a founder of the 
modern conservative movement speak out against bigotry its 
important for american society as a whole for someone with a 
distinguished career to say i am a gay american and i am not 
ashamed said gregory king communications director for the 
human rights campaign fund a gay political lobby 
urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay amp lesbian 
task force another lobbying group said liebmans statement is a 
welcome one 
for years weve said theres an enormous diversity in the gay 
and lesbian movement vaid said wednesday there are gay 
progressives and gay conservatives 
liebman revealed his homosexuality this month in the pages of 
william f buckleys conservative national review and the advocate 
a los angelesbased gay magazine 
in an interview wednesday liebman 66 said he decided to 
announce hes gay because he sees signs that the political right is 
becoming dangerously bigoted 
the primary impact i wanted to have in this whole coming out 
was on the conservative community just to sort of alert them to 
the dangers of homophobia and all that comes with it he said 
but roger stone a conservative political consultant said he 
did not think liebmans statement would affect the conservative 
movement 
i think it will be viewed as the actions of an individual 
stone said adding that he did not believe bigotry was growing 
among conservatives 
liebman first made his revelation in a letter to buckley whom 
he describes as his best friend 
i am both gay and conservative and i dont find that a 
contradiction liebman wrote in the july 9 issue of the national 
review 
explaining why he chose to go public now liebman continued i 
fear that our cause might sink back into the ooze in which so much 
of it rested in prenational review days in that dark age the 
american right was heavily perhaps dominantly made up of bigots 
buckley who once suggested that gay people with aids be 
tattooed on the buttocks and called gore vidal a queer on 
national television responded by asking if its reasonable to 
expect the larger community to cease to think of the activity of 
homosexuals as unnatural whatever its etiology 
however buckley also wrote that he understood liebmans 
pain and promised the national review will not be scarred by 
thoughtless gaybashing 
liebman said wednesday he feels no rancor toward buckley even 
though they disagree on whether homosexuality is moral or normal 
there is nothing that bill buckley could say that would offend 
me or make me feel bad liebman said this is just the way the 
man thinks 
born in brooklyn ny liebman was a jew until age 55 when he 
converted to roman catholicism buckley was his godfather 
at 15 liebman had joined the young communist league and for 
years was active in other communist front groups he served two 
years in the army air corps but was discharged in 1944 for being 
homosexual a fact he kept secret until this month 
after the war liebman joined irgun an underground zionist 
organization and worked as an organizer and fundraiser until the 
early 1950s liebman worked for a variety of leftleaning groups 
but his politics shifted and he teamed with buckley and others 
to pioneer the modern conservative movement he founded the young 
americans for freedom and was active in the conservative party of 
new york and the presidential campaigns of barry goldwater and 
ronald reagan 
liebman came to washington after reagan was elected in 1980 
working first as a consultant to the federal government from 1982 
to 1987 he was director of public affairs and special projects at 
the national endowment for the arts he is now director of special 
projects at the federal trade commission

the bush administration is offering congress a 
compromise proposal on military aid to el salvador that could 
result in a reduction of between 15 percent and 30 percent of the 
85 million being requested for next year 
as a sweetener for democrats the proposal would terminate 
military assistance altogether if the salvadoran government refuses 
to negotiate in good faith for a ceasefire and a permanent 
settlement to its 10yearold war with leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
the administrations recommendations were outlined in a document 
made available to the associated press 
the proposal is designed to give both the salvadoran government 
and the rebels the incentive to reach a settlement 
it also is aimed at heading off congressional approval of a 
democratic proposal that calls for a 50 percent cut in military 
aid which would be reinstated only if the fmln launches a major 
offensive or fails to meet other conditions administration 
officials said that proposal approved last may in a test vote 
leaves the fmln little incentive to move toward peace 
assistant secretary of state bernard aronson planned to hold 
talks on capitol hill today on the administrations 
recommendations he was in el salvador earlier this week 
exchanging views on the issue with military and government leaders 
according to the document the administration is willing to 
withhold 15 percent of military assistance funds until april 1 
1991 six months after the start of the 1991 fiscal year 
the withheld money would be made available to the salvadoran 
government only if several conditions are met including 
significant progress toward bringing to trial those responsible 
for the murder of eight people including six jesuit priests in 
san salvador last november 
in his talks in el salvador aronson pressed authorities to 
ensure that the guilty are brought to justice a report by a house 
democratic task force in april said the investigation had come to a 
virtual standstill and that the salvadoran government had showed no 
interest in determining whether senior military officers were 
responsible 
according to the administrations aid proposal an additional 15 
percent would be withheld provided the fmln meets certain 
conditions these include complying with a ceasefire agreement 
showing a willingness to negotiate in good faith and refraining 
from acts of terrorism or military actions that threaten the 
government 
the united states has provided more than 5 billion in military 
and economic aid to el salvador over the past decade officials 
have said repeatedly in recent months that conditions have never 
been better for an end to the conflict 
one reason is the belief that the rebels will be more flexible 
in negotiations because of declining international support for 
their cause 
the electoral defeat of the leftist sandinista government in 
nicaragua last february left the fmln more isolated internationally 
than at any time in a decade despite that setback sandinista 
remnants outside government control are continuing to send supplies 
to the salvadoran insurgents the officials said 
the government and the guerrillas have had several rounds of 
discussions this year the next meeting is set for july 20 in costa 
rica

senate majority leader george mitchell is 
serving notice that if president bush wants his cherished cut in 
capital gains taxes hell also have to swallow higher income taxes 
on wealthy americans 
mitchell dmaine said wednesday that a refusal by bush to 
accept a boost in the income tax rates paid by the richest 
wageearners would kill any budget deal that involves slashed 
capital gains levies 
there are certain points beyond which you cant go mitchell 
said 
the majority leaders comments to reporters came as 
congressional leaders and white house officials continued talks on 
how to slice next years budget deficit which is expected to 
surpass 160 billion 
the bargainers discussed ways to save at least 10 billion by 
cutting benefit programs such as medicare but reached no 
agreements the two sides planned to hold separate strategy 
sessions today and to resume negotiations friday 
many congressional republicans have insisted that the president 
will never accept an increase in income tax rates for the richest 
americans despite his recent easing of the antitax stance he took 
during his 1988 election campaign 
but mitchell said swapping one for the other was a matter of 
equity 
in the past decade the federal tax system has become 
increasingly regressive he said the middle class in our 
society those are the people who are paying increasingly who 
are shouldering the burden of taxation in our society 
i dont see how anyone in good conscience can further that 
trend he said 
under current law income tax rates rise to 33 percent in the 
uppermiddle income bracket and then drop back to 28 percent for 
the additional earnings of the most wealthy americans capital 
gains income earnings derived from the sale of assets such as 
stocks and real estate is taxed at those same rates 
bush has been pushing to cut the capital gains rate to 15 
percent arguing it would spur investment and economic growth 
mitchell and other democrats oppose the change because the wealthy 
would benefit disproportionately 
a frequently discussed compromise is to simultaneously cut the 
capital gains rate and eliminate the drop in the income tax rate 
for the richest taxpayers mitchells comments wednesday reflected 
his willingness to consider such a tradeoff 
mitchell said that at a minimum the top marginal tax rate should 
be raised to 33 percent and he personally favored 35 percent 
anything less than 33 percent would be completely unacceptable 
he said

divisions among democrats on the level of 
defense spending widened as the senate budget committee chairman 
questioned why deep cuts can only be achieved by drastic reductions 
in military personnel 
i must disagree with your view that the defense spending level 
in the senate budget resolution cannot be reached without 
unacceptable disruption to americas military establishment 
sen james sasser dtenn said wednesday in a letter to sen sam 
nunn chairman of the armed services committee 
as his panel crafts a defense bill for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 nunn dga has sought to illustrate the effects that 
significant spending cuts would have on the nations armed forces 
his committee is weighing proposals to slash president bushs 
request for the antimissile strategic defense initiative by nearly 
1 billion leave intact the white house proposal for the b2 
bomber and limit funds for landbased nuclear missiles to research 
and development money 
bush sought 303 billion for the 1991 fiscal year 
pressed by some democrats for larger cuts than he has proposed 
nunn laid out an alternative tuesday to meet the 286 billion total 
approved by the sassers budget panel the plan calls for reducing 
the 21 millionmember activeduty force by 285000 
however to meet nunns defense figure of 289 billion sasser 
indicated that a reduction in personnel would total 100000 
sasser in the threepage letter said the differences between 
the two plans is concentrated in two areas manpower and personnel 
and readiness and sustainability 
a breakdown of the cuts nunn required from the various areas of 
defense shows that to meet his total 5 billion was cut from 
readiness and 15 billion from manpower said congressional 
sources who requested anonymity 
to achieve sassers defense spending level 6 billion was taken 
from readiness and 39 billion from manpower the sources said 
the budget resolution is made to look as if it requires 
cutting military personnel by 285000 sasser said in his letter 
that of course was not our intention and it is not an outcome 
necessitated by our approach 
sasser cited the congressional budget office and his own staffs 
analysis in arguing that the reductions can be achieved with a 
smaller personnel cut and changes in the procurement budgets 
the armed services committee proposal for the sdi program also 
known as star wars calls for 37 billion for the antimissile 
shield that is about 980 million below the presidents request 
the committee also is considering defense secretary dick 
cheneys revised request for the b2 stealth bomber which calls 
for two of the radarevading aircraft in fiscal 1991 and 75 planes 
in total 
the b2 is in the mx landbased missile is out said sen 
timothy wirth dcolo a member of the armed services panel 
another proposal before the committee calls for limiting funds 
for the program to move mx missiles from fixed silos to railroad 
cars to the administrations request for 548 million in research 
and development money some 16 billion in procurement and 
construction funds would be eliminated 
the panel also is considering slightly more than 200 million 
for the midgetman missile 
also before the committee is a proposal to eliminate about 750 
million in research funds for milstar the air forces navigation 
and communications satellite and reduce money earmarked for the 
boost surveillance and tracking system said sources who requested 
anonymity 
the latter program is related to the sdi program and would track 
tactical ballistic missiles 
meanwhile wednesday rep les aspin dwis chairman of the 
house armed services committee met with house speaker thomas s 
foley dwash on the schedule for considering the defense bill in 
that chamber but reached no decision 
aspins committee planned to take up the measure in september 
but other house panels have been pressing for action on the defense 
authorization legislation before the august recess congressional 
sources said

former watergate prosecutor archibald cox says 
five senators appear to have violated ethics standards in their 
involvement with the savings and loan crisis an accusation one 
lawmaker contends smacks of mccarthyism 
the senate ethics committee is investigating whether the five 
broke senate rules by meeting with regulators about lincoln savings 
and loan association of irvine calif after accepting a combined 
13 million in political contributions from the failed thrifts 
owner charles keating jr 
the senators appear to have violated a provision in the code of 
ethics for government service cox said in a brief filed with the 
ethics panel wednesday on behalf of the citizens watchdog group 
common cause which he chairs 
congress has adopted the code for all government employees 
including officeholders he said 
cox acknowledged he did not have all the information before the 
ethics panel and was relying on published accounts of the senators 
actions 
if those accounts are substantially true each of the five 
violated the ethics code as well as the underlying principle 
forbidding the use of public office in a way that appears to be 
influenced by the receipt of financial benefit cox said 
the senators are alan cranston dcalif john glenn dohio 
dennis deconcini dariz john mccain rariz and donald riegle 
dmich 
coxs argument is simply saying people should be judged guilty 
by association we tried to put an end to guilt by association when 
joe mccarthy was denounced mccain said in a statement 
mccarthyism has no place in the deliberations of the ethics 
committee or how members of the senate are judged 
glenn said he had not read the brief but added common cause 
like every citizen has the right to put forward its views i have 
no way of knowing what if any influence this opinion will have 
with the ethics committee 
the washington times meanwhile citing sources close to the 
senate ethics committee reported in todays editions that the 
committees special counsel will recommend dropping further 
inquires of glenn and mccain 
spokesmen for cranston deconcini and riegle said they would 
have no immediate comment on common causes brief 
the ethics code says a public servant should never discriminate 
by performing special favors said cox a former us solicitor 
general and special prosecutor during the watergate investigation 
all the senators except riegle met with edwin gray 
thenchairman of the federal home loan bank board on april 2 
1987 they discussed the boards investigation of lincoln sampl 
although details of the conversation are in dispute 
riegle joined the four senators a week later at a meeting with 
four bank board officials who were investigating lincoln he had 
received 78250 from keating and associates but later returned the 
money 
the board eventually seized control of the insolvent thrift last 
year bailing out lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers 2 billion 
making it the most expensive bailout in the savings and loan crisis 
citing news reports common cause said the senators pressed 
regulators to treat lincoln fairly and expedite the investigation 
but even if the senators did not request favorable treatment for 
lincoln the regulators could not fail to be impressed with the 
amount of senatorial influence supporting lincoln savings and 
loan cox said 
intervention by senators raises highly delicate ethical 
questions cox said 
the keating case he said involves such extraordinary use of 
the office of senator as to violate the portion of the code of 
ethics which mandates that a public servant should never 
discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or 
privileges to anyone whether for remuneration or not

a festival atmosphere is building for the 
first top dog world championship prairie dog shoot this weekend 
the sheriff is just hoping the combination of cowboys and 
animalrights activists doesnt get someone killed 
in this isolated southwestern colorado town ravaged by drought 
and the closing of most of the uranium mines that were the 
economys backbone residents hope to have some fun and make a 
little money off the competition 
stores are selling tshirts hats pins bandannas and whatever 
else they can get a prairie dog logo on all 52 rooms in the areas 
only two motels in tiny naturita five miles away have been booked 
for the first time in two years 
the event has drawn 106 shooters from as far away as texas and 
california some 50 protesters many of whom plan to make a 
ninehour drive from denver are also expected to show up for the 
twoday hunt starting saturday 
those people over there carry guns but if they dont like our 
attitude tough we have a first amendment right to protest said 
robin duxbury of the rocky mountain humane society theres no 
good reason to shoot prairie dogs 
its shaping up as a clash of cultures urban liberal 
animalrights advocates coming into a rural conservative valley 
where many residents moved to avoid city hassles the combined 
population of nucla and naturita is about 1500 
gov roy romer has refused protesters demand that he protect 
them with the national guard and local authorities are concerned 
about the possibility for violence 
sheriff tom gilmore said he will have at least 25 officers on 
hand some from the state and the us bureau of land management 
if we can just keep the protesters away from the locals and 
the locals away from the protesters well be ok he said 
animalrights activists are demanding that romer issue an 
executive order to stop the hunt at a rally last week cartoonist 
berke breathed and author cleveland amory called the prairie dog a 
lovable innocent defenseless animal 
many rural westerners however regard prairie dogs as 
diseaseridden rats dangerous to livestock and children 
teenagers routinely spend summer mornings shooting the critters 
the problem is theyre called prairie dogs not rats or 
mice said rancher bob dyer i got hassled in the denver 
airport last week but they quieted right down when i told them id 
ship as many prairie dogs to em as they wanted for 50 a pair 
ill even put them through sheep dip and get the fleas off 
mike mahew the shoots organizer said the hunters competing 
for more than 7000 in prizes will have to follow strict rules 
theyll shoot from 7 am to 1 pm with rangemasters along to 
supervise scoring no spectators or booze will be allowed 
well wait and see mahew said thats all anybody can

the bush administration plans an ambitious 
diplomatic campaign to rally support for nicaraguan president 
violeta chamorro in her effort to overcome widespread strikes by 
prosandinista workers us officials say 
the campaign will be focused on western europe and latin america 
and will include personal letters from president bush to some 
foreign leaders said the officials who asked not to be identified 
several officials scoffed at the notion that the united states 
may be planning to intervene militarily on mrs chamorros behalf 
the state department said wednesday that mrs chamorro has not 
asked for us assistance nor has the united states offered any 
strike leaders say 90000 workers have walked off their jobs 
since the unrest began almost two weeks ago but nicaraguan 
officials say that figure is highly exaggerated 
mrs chamorro and the state department have both said the 
strikes are a politically motivated effort by the leftist 
sandinistas to undercut the governments economic program 
five weeks ago delegates from more than 20 countries assembled 
in rome to pledge financial backing for the nicaraguan government 
based on mrs chamorros economic recovery program 
the plan includes some painful adjustment measures including an 
end to government subsidies on some food items as part of bid to 
bring down the countrys high inflation rate 
the message being sent by bush and us diplomats is that mrs 
chamorro deserves support at a time when she is under fire for 
implementing a program which has won broad international backing 
the officials said 
the pledges at the rome conference came to about 300 million 
the officials added roughly the same as the us bilateral aid 
program 
she mrs chamorro needs the kind of international support 
that will encourage the sandinistas to cease and desist one 
official said 
underscoring the apparent us determination to limit american 
involvement in the conflict the state department expressed full 
confidence in mrs chamorros ability to manage the situation 
at least four people have been killed and 84 injured in the 
disturbances but strike leaders issued a statement wednesday 
indicating interest in a negotiated settlement 
the state department meanwhile expressed support for mrs 
chamorros call for a swift and peaceful resolution of the conflict 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said mismanagement by the 
sandinista government that mrs chamorro succeeded this year left 
the nicaraguan economy in disastrous straits 
now he said for political gain they are seeking to blame 
the government for taking reform measures necessary to clean up the 
mess 
the department said wednesday night it is urging us citizens 
not to travel to nicaragua at present because of the unrest 
americans in nicaragua were urged to stay inside their hotels and 
homes

all the family when he made a spirited defense of son neil bushs 
integrity in a savings and loan bankruptcy case

case told reporters you dont want to see a grown woman cry do

she spoke on air force one on the way home wednesday night from 
the economic summit in houston 
mrs bush attended the postsummit news conference where the 
president confided the probe has been hard on the family

sons who want to go to the barricades against what they regard 
as unfair criticism of their brothers role as an outside director 
of silverado banking savings and loan association of denver which 
went under at a cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
the president spoke for all the family today the first lady

face and said i aint going to lie to you she joked that 
whatshisname feels fabulous

david this weekend she said 
mrs bush sporting a silver star and lone star earrings given 
to all the leaders wives received as mementos said even the heat 
was not as bad as i expected 
she said the real truth is that it was hotter every single 
day in washington dc than it was in houston texas 
she expressed amazement that 5000 volunteers turned out 
beforehand to clean up houstons streets 
they didnt just clean the streets we saw they cleaned 
all the neighborhoods they were wonderful she said 
the wives raved truthfully over everything they raved 
over the attitude of the people she said 
i heard one wife say to another one if you went home to your 
country do you think you could find 5000 volunteers to put on a 
program like this and she said no way we dont even understand 
the concept of volunteers related mrs bush who refused to 
identify her 
she said i love denis thatcher husband of britains prime 
minister and denied he felt out of place as the only male spouse at 
the summit 
oh no we had men at the party for him she said referring 
to mondays dinner for spouses 
but i told him he could no longer kiss my hand because i am 
not going to be teased back into kissing his said mrs bush who

a prescription drug already on the market can 
reverse the slow loss of spinal bone that causes the crushed 
vertebrae and stooped posture of old age a study published today 
shows 
women who took the medicine in a twoyear experiment conducted 
at seven us medical centers cut their risk of broken vertebrae in 
half 
we think its extremely encouraging news said sandra 
raymond executive director of the national osteoporosis 
foundation our arsenal is very small hopefully now based on 
these studies we may have another option 
the medicine called etidronate joins two other prescription 
medicines available to treat osteoporosis the brittlebones 
disease that afflicts an estimated 15 million to 20 million 
americans because of its apparent advantages it could become the 
medicine of choice for many elderly victims 
this is really exciting said dr nelson b watts of emory 
university principal author of the study we can wait until 
somebody is already in bad shape and make them better they wont 
stand straight or play basketball but the deterioration will be 
halted 
crushed vertebrae are the most common consequence of 
osteoporosis a disorder that largely affects women after 
menopause there is no evidence so far that etidronate will prevent 
hip fractures which are a less common but more serious hazard of 
the disease 
the study was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine in may the journal carried a smaller study by european 
researchers that reached similar conclusions both studies were 
financed by procter amp gambles norwich eaton pharmaceuticals which 
makes etidronate 
in the latest work 429 women with osteoporosis were randomly 
assigned to take etidronate or dummy placebos for two years when 
it was over the spinal bone density of those getting etidronate 
had increased 5 percent and they suffered half as many vertebral 
fractures as the other women 
during their younger years people lose old bone and make new 
bone at about the same rate later on however many lose bone 
faster than they replace it 
etidronate works by slowing the bodys resorption of old bone 
this allows the slow production of new bone to outpace the loss 
the medicine resulted in a twothirds drop in fractures in women 
with the weakest bones the study showed 
the impact of etidronate was greatest in individuals with the 
lowest bone mass noted dr william peck of washington university 
in st louis that means we are talking about reducing fractures 
in people who are at the greatest risk thats an exciting 
possibility 
during the study the women took the medicine for two weeks out 
of every three months the drug is already on the market for 
treatment of pagets disease another bone ailment however it has 
not been approved by the us food and drug administration for 
osteoporosis 
currently the only prescription drugs approved for treatment of 
osteoporosis are estrogen and calcitonin 
etidronate carries no known side effects costs 200 to 300 per 
year and is taken in pill form doctors say these are important 
advantages calcitonin requires three injections a week and costs 
10 times more 
while estrogen is a highly effective treatment for protecting 
bones during the first years after menopause doctors are unsure 
whether it helps older women estrogen which is a sex hormone 
cannot be taken by women at high risk of breast cancer it also can 
cause resumption of menstrual bleeding

undercover police guided by the stars staked out 
various points in the city in their quest for the zodiac killer 
whose 21day pattern of shootings led investigators to suspect he 
would strike again today 
police consulted astrological charts occult books fbi 
psychological profiles and letters scrawled by the gunman in 
selecting their positions 
the gunman has vowed in his letters to shoot 12 people one for 
each sign of the zodiac he has struck four times in four months 
one victim died 
police including a task force of 50 refused to divulge the 
locations staked out to match zodiacs pattern of preying on easy 
targets they dressed as homeless or elderly people or others who 
are vulnerable 
the guardian angels a redbereted citizen crimefighting force 
patrolled sections of the brooklynqueens boundary where three of 
the attacks took place and inside central park where the fourth 
occurred 
the shootings have followed a 21day pattern the first occurred 
march 8 the others on march 29 may 31 and june 21 the time 
between the second and third shootings was 63 days a multiple of 
21 each shooting occurred early on a thursday 
the zodiacs victims all men have been a scorpio a gemini a 
taurus and a cancer in letters he sent to police and news 
organizations he scrawled the symbols for his victims 
astrological signs 
one survivor said a stranger asked him his birth date two days 
before he was shot police said the gunman may have obtained other 
victims birth dates where applications are filled out such as 
banks or government offices 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli acknowledged on wednesday 
the best leads could come after the killer claims another victim 
the more times an incident occurs the better the chance of 
finding the individual he said 
in his letters the gunman has tried to convince police he is

an international conference to discuss the future 
of vietnamese boat people has been postponed in a continued 
disagreement over repatriation of nonrefugees 
raymond hall spokesman for the office of the united nations 
high commissioner for refugees said wednesday that no new date has 
been set for the conference which had been scheduled for july 
1617 
hall called the delay very dangerous and said risks were 
growing that countries near vietnam would refuse to allow boat 
people to land on their shores he said about 112000 boat people 
are in southeast asian refugee camps 
he said the delay could threaten the un principle of first 
asylum under which refugeseekers are granted temporary asylum 
until they are resettled in other nations or repatriated to their 
homeland 
a un meeting last year agreed on an international plan to cope 
with the flood of vietnamese boat people including the 
introduction of screening procedures to separate genuine refugees 
those escaping political persecution from migrants in search of a 
better life 
it also set up a program to repatriate people wishing to go back 
to vietnam so far 3400 have returned voluntarily hall said 
however disagreement continues over the fate of nonrefugees 
who are unwilling to be sent back 
the bush administration remains opposed to the forcible 
repatriation of economic migrants diplomats in geneva say us 
officials privately are showing some flexibility 
hanoi also is reluctant to accept involuntary returns 
britain under pressure from its overcrowded hong kong colony 
and southeast asian nations have demanded the united states agree 
to mandatory repatriation or set up its own camps to accommodate 
nonrefugees 
at a meeting in manila in may southeast asian countries issued 
an ultimatum that they would stop granting asylum if no settlement 
was reached 
hall said the high commissioner had agreed to postpone next 
weeks meeting because of lack of common ground among participants 
the united states and other resettlement countries firstasylum 
countries and vietnam 
he said intense negotiations were taking place but a further 
meeting was unlikely to take place before august 
hall said by the end of may there were 112000 boat people in 
camps in the region up from 83000 in may 1989 about 55000 are 
in in hong kong

tiny aftershocks of the bay area earthquake 
are being delivered this month nine months after the earth moved 
says a hospital projecting up to a twothirds increase in births 
but other hospitals are not sure the fault for any baby boom 
lies with the oct 17 quake that caused blackouts and trapped 
people at home for days 
seton medical center in daly city just south of san francisco 
projects the higher birth rate for july were calling them quake 
babies kathy kohrman setons director of marketing said 
wednesday 
we had a blackout situation but not a lot of devastation from 
the quake in our area and people had a lot of time on their 
hands she said 
lisa gonzales a nurse at seton was due july 15 but delivered 
7pound alejandro prematurely this week 
the telephones were down the tv wasnt working mrs 
gonzales said of the situation at her house it was a very 
emotional time 
we didnt know whether we were going to see each other again 
and so you know 
mrs gonzales was at home and her husband dr gilberto 
gonzales was working when the quake struck it measured 71 on the 
richter scale and killed 67 people 
he took several days off work after that when he finally got 
home mrs gonzales said i was afraid to be home alone for a 
while we werent really planning a baby but we had been thinking 
about it 
seton expects to deliver 100 babies this month compared with 60 
to 80 during an average july 
newborns will get special quake baby certificates and 
mothers and fathers will win a parent survival kit if their 
infant weighs in at 7 pounds 1 ounce the hospital said the kit 
includes diapers and toys 
other san francisco area hospitals say the wave of births hasnt 
registered on any scale yet 
we did have a fairly high rate of birth over the norm during 
june but i cant say it was quakerelated said barbara shingai 
spokeswoman for the community hospital in watsonville nearest the 
epicenter of the temblor its really too early to tell if well 
see a continued peak in july 
she said 136 babies were born at the watsonville hospital in 
june compared to an average 129 a month 
kaiser hospitals in northern california and san francisco 
general hospital also report no shakeups in their delivery 
statistics this summer 
theres a twoyear trend in california and the us of rising 
birth rates but i dont think you can speculate that the 
earthquake is causing any of it said jennifer cross of kaiser 
its hard to tell whats behind birth rates

ousted east german leader erich honecker and 
his secret police chief allowed libyan terrorists to carry out the 
1986 discotheque bombing that killed two american soldiers a 
leading newspaper reported today 
the west berlin bombing which also killed a turkish woman 
prompted the us air force raid on the libyan capital of tripoli 
10 days later 
the report in the west germany paper die welt was the latest in 
a string of disclosures on relations between international 
terrorists and honeckers communist regime 
according to the report secret police chief erich mielke knew 
on march 20 1986 that libyan terrorists were about to attack a 
us target in west berlin but did nothing to stop it 
sixteen days later a bomb at the la belle discotheque killed 
the soldiers and turkish woman and injured more than 200 other 
people 
on march 24 the ministry for state security secret police 
drafted a written report for honecker the response was not to do 
anything but rather to let the libyans do as they pleased die 
welt said 
a colonel in the secret police or stasi who tried to stop the 
april 5 bombing was fired on the spot the paper said 
the terrorist incident provoked the april 15 us bombing raid 
on the libyan cities of benghazi and tripoli including an attack 
on the heavily guarded compound of libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi 
die welt said stasi archives gave a detailed account of 
preparations for the la belle bombing 
the paper supplied gave the following account 
on march 25 1986 a man claiming to be a diplomatic courier for 
the libyans peoples bureau or embassy in east berlin drove 
into west berlin in an embassy car carrying seven grenades three 
automatic pistols and two semiautomatic rifles 
the driver identified as musbah alalbani carried a note with 
the addresses of three discotheques including la belle stasi 
records even contain the cars license number cd 6820 
however the attack was postponed because of inadequate planning 
the driver traveled to west berlin once more on march 30 but 
returned on april 4 the eve of the la belle bombing 
on april 5 the stasi monitored a telephone call to the home of 
yussef salam a palestinian it knew under the code name of nuri 
immediately after the call in which salam was told it hasnt 
worked out yet he met with a libyan embassy official and drove 
to west berlin 
the la belle bomb went off around 5 am that morning 
die welt identified several other palestinians and libyans who 
allegedly played a role in the attack salam who also uses the 
name of yasser chraidi is believed to be living in algeria it 
said 
authorities of the noncommunist government that came to power 
in east germany after free elections in march also say the 
communist regime harbored west german terrorists of the red army 
faction which launched fatal attacks in west germany some 
suspects have been captured 
east german interior minister petermichael diestel has been 
quoted as saying the stasi sheltered the international terrorist 
known as carlos as well as the man believed responsible for the 
1972 massacre of 17 israeli athletes at the olympic games in munich 
the secret police force maintained at least informal contacts 
with the basque separatist group eta and the irish republican army 
which seeks to overthrow british rule in northern ireland diestel 
has said

a band played happy days are here again and 
city hall was adorned with flags from every state as officials 
celebrated the news that the big apple will host the 1992 
democratic convention 
democratic national chairman ron brown mayor david dinkins and 
gov mario cuomo used a desk wednesday in city hall that belonged 
to george washington to sign a contract making new york city the 
convention site 
we wont let you down dinkins told brown an old friend and 
native new yorker new york is a great convention town 
the convention at madison square garden is expected to pump 100 
million into the new york economy and bring 35000 delegates 
guests and journalists to town 
democrats will nominate the next president of the united 
states two years from now this week in americas most dynamic city 
and in one of the worlds greatest cities new york the big 
apple dinkins said 
the race for the democratic presidential nominee is wide open 
new york was chosen over new orleans as the convention site 
brown said new orleans chances were hurt by the louisiana 
legislatures passage of strong antiabortion legislation but that 
was not the deciding factor 
new yorks early pledge to come up with the more than 20 
million for the convention and a pledge by prominent democratic 
fundraisers in the city to fill the partys coffers helped 
persuade brown 
new york had the convention in 1976 when jimmy carter was 
nominated and won the presidency and in 1980 when carter was 
renominated and lost

gov bob martinez has moved to shore up 
his lawandorder image in a tough reelection campaign after an 
apparent murder by an escaped convict stirred memories of the 
willie horton affair 
earlier this week martinez a republican ordered thousands of 
prison inmates removed from workrelease programs similar to one 
that cost democrat michael dukakis dearly in his failed 1988 
presidential bid 
among the inmates affected by martinez order was 80yearold 
roswell gilbert who is serving a life sentence for shooting his 
wife in a widely publicized mercykilling case 
in the 1988 presidential race thencandidate george bush 
painted dukakis the massachusetts governor as a liberal weak on 
crime gop television ads featured horton a massachusetts inmate 
who raped a maryland woman while on a furlough program 
publicopinion surveys indicate martinez can ill afford to lose 
ground on law enforcement an issue that helped propel him to 
victory in 1986 
but the june 24 slaying of a woman at a shopping mall allegedly 
by a convicted killer who walked away from a prison work detail 
gave democratic challengers an opening against the vulnerable 
firstterm governor 
the frontrunner in the democratic race for governor popular 
former us sen lawton chiles immediately seized on the slaying 
of 44yearold faye lamb vann as evidence that martinezs tough 
talk on crime was just that talk 
its proof that there is no system there is no strategy about 
how were going to fight crime in this state said chiles who 
served three terms in the senate i think its obvious that this 
has not been something the governor and his people have been paying 
attention to 
mrs vanns alleged killer escapee donald david dillbeck was 
convicted of killing a sheriffs deputy in 1979 dillbeck was 
eligible for minimumsecurity work details despite his crime 
martinez denied he was trying to put out a political fire by 
removing inmates from workrelease programs 
i dont think we can guarantee forever that someone cant get 
away from one of our prison systems we can guarantee theres less 
likelihood now the great regret is that the life cant be brought 
back martinez said 
the governor said the states inmate review system wasnt 
working and was antiquated when he ordered 3400 inmates in 
workrelease programs to more secure prisons 
before the new controversy martinez had often touted the 28000 
new prison beds authorized during his administration he made a 
television ad boasting of the number of death warrants he has 
signed that featured the smiling face of serial killer ted bundy 
put to death in january 1989 
but recent polls have indicated chiles would defeat both 
martinez and the other democrat running in the sept 4 primary 
us rep bill nelson the surveys also show nelson beating 
martinez 
nelson has stayed out of the dillbeck case he was burned 
earlier in the campaign by attempting to attack martinez over the 
early prison release of a black man charles street who is 
currently on trial in miami for the subsequent slayings of two 
miami police officers 
nelson brought up the spectre of horton who is also black then 
was forced to apologize when civil rights activists labeled his 
charges racist 
chiles hasnt mentioned horton but contends mrs vann might be 
alive if martinez had been properly managing the prison system 
if you can do it today then obviously there was room to do it 
all along he said he just elected not to do it or failed to 
do it

a historical society wont be allowed to 
cart off three french colonial houses from missouri in its efforts 
to celebrate this western illinois citys tricentennial next year 
missouri decided late last month to buy the houses in ste 
genevieve mo to keep them there jane beetem of the missouri 
department of natural resources said tuesday the purchase price 
was not disclosed 
she said the state will try to resell the houses with 
stipulations they remain in ste genevieve a town of 5000 that 
was once part of frances louisiana territory 
we certainly would have hated to see them moved ms beetem 
said tuesday they are a very unique type of property 
the state of missouri became interested in the houses after a 
group called peoria 1691 foundation said it wanted to buy and move 
them to peoria in time for the illinois river citys tricentennial 
in september 1991 
one proposal called for reconstructing on the banks of the 
illinois river a french colony like the settlement three centuries 
ago that evolved into peoria 
the original village located in what is now downtown peoria 
was destroyed by fire in 1812 forcing civic leaders to look 
elsewhere for authentic french colonial houses to restore 
the prospect of peoria buying and moving historic houses 
outraged local residents of ste genevieve who demanded missouri 
officials step in to prevent the transaction 
the three houses targeted by peoria included the 
bequetteribault house a restored log postandground house 
built sometime between 1790 and 1808 
its considered valuable because there are only four known 
structures of its kind in the united states and three of those are 
in ste genevieve a town of 5000 located 75 miles south of st 
louis on the mississippi river 
the other historic structures are the durant house built in 
1810 and the rozier cabin built in 1841 and currently 
disassembled and in storage a fourth home had been considered but 
the society expressed concern about moving it because it is built 
of stone

the code that governs british treatment of royalty 
is largely unwritten but always strict and novelist an wilson 
has violated one of the sternest rules of all 
his sin has been to report a dinnertable chat with her majesty 
queen elizabeth the queen mother 
that her remarks to wilson were fairly innocuous and that the 
conversation took place nearly a decade ago matters little the 
affair has provoked some sharp language from london society 
scoundrel thundered lord wyatt of weeford 
an intolerable betrayal echoed nicholas soames member of 
parliament and scion of the churchill family 
wilson 39 is a gifted novelist and acute social commentator 
who clearly knew he was courting trouble when he published the 
queen mothers tabletalk in the weekly spectator magazine two 
weeks ago 
it is probably the grossest impropriety to embarrass her or 
her host by repeating our conversation he wrote 
i do so however without very much compunction since she 
never gives interviews and i can think of no better person than 
queen elizabeth with whom to start off an occasional series of 
conversations with men and women who have lived through most of the 
years of this century and whose memories stretch back far 
in the conversation reproduced in dialogue form the mother of 
queen elizabeth ii and widow of king george vi was said to have 
revealed a fondness for detective stories and a problem with her 
cash flow had such an awful afternoon today with my bank 
manager scolding me about my overdraft 
after a few remarks about politics came this gem of an account 
of a poetry evening at windsor castle during world war ii at which 
ts eliot recited the waste land 
elizabeth we had this rather lugubrious man in a suit and he 
read a poem i think it was called the desert and first the 
girls got the giggles and then i did and then even the king 
wilson the desert maam are you sure it wasnt called 
the waste land 
elizabeth thats it im afraid we all giggled such a gloomy 
man looked as though he worked in a bank and we didnt understand 
a word 
wilson i believe he did once work in a bank 
the article published in the midst of national celebrations of 
the queen mothers 90th birthday was thoughtful and affectionate 
but lord wyatt himself a former journalist was scandalized 
especially since it was he who was host of the dinner 
wilson is boastfully shameless in being a scoundrel he 
wrote in a letter to the spectator published a week later it was 
he charged a deceitfully obtained and stolen interview 
soames in a letter to the magazine called it an appalling 
want of chivalry and an absolutely fundamental breach of 
trust 
buckingham palace which speaks for the queen mother declined 
to comment but wilson who prefers initials to his first name 
andrew reacted in this weeks spectator to what he called an 
absurd taboo 
why all the fuss he asked the queen mother is about to 
be 90 years old the newspapers are full of 16page fullcolor 
supplements all roughly speaking conveying the message gawd 
bless yer maam none of the articles i have read have conveyed 
what it is like to meet her or what she says 
commenting in the independent on sunday columnist francis wheen 
said wyatt was cutting a comical figure he noted that the 
lords own autobiography contained gossipy tidbits from his private 
conversations with famous people 
wyatt warned that the affair would strengthen those who want to 
impose stricter privacy laws on the media 
wheen wrote that wyatt himself is a columnist for the tabloid 
news of the world and although that newspaper has many 
qualities respect for privacy is not i think one of them 
hugh montgomerymassingberd argued in the daily telegraph that 
writers were always scribbling down conversations with the high and 
mighty hoping to publish them one day 
this may be an ungentlemanly instinct he wrote but you 
have to decide whether to be a gent or a scribbler and i for one 
am prepared to defend a n wilson for choosing the latter course

the troubled covenant house for young runaways 
has turned to a nun to restore cash and credibility that were 
diminished in a scandal that forced the resignation of its founder 
covenant house said wednesday it selected sister mary rose 
mcgeady as president she replaces the rev bruce ritter a 
franciscan priest who resigned in february 
sister mcgeady 62 is an associate executive director of 
catholic charities in the roman catholic diocese of brooklyn she 
oversees 80 social service programs a 40 million budget and a 
staff of more than 800 people 
the covenant house board of directors named sister mcgeady on 
tuesday she takes office sept 1 
in a statement sister mcgeady said she looks forward to the 
challenge of ensuring covenant house continues to shine as a 
beacon for the thousands of kids who are still out there without a 
family or home 
covenant house shelters 25000 youths annually in 17 dormitories 
in the united states canada and latin america 
ritter who resigned feb 27 had been accused of having sexual 
relations with shelter residents and lending covenant house funds 
to two former board members he has denied wrongdoing 
covenant house officials have expressed concern that the 
institution may have difficulty surviving without ritter whose 
fundraising appeals attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in 
donations 
donations which almost solely sustain covenant house have 
fluctuated wildly since his departure anticipating serious losses 
the organizations board has laid off 111 of its 420 employees and 
cut its budget from 86 million to 72 million in the new fiscal 
year which started july 1 
were hoping the donations will come back up sister mcgeady 
said in a telephone interview if they dont it might be 
necessary for us to do some more cutting

an animalrights activist has challenged 
an organizer of a pigeon shoot to a norules fistfight to end the 
fundraising event that leaves thousands of birds dead each year 
steve hindi among 300 animalrights activists who protested the 
labor day shoot last year challenged organizer bob tobash in a 
letter 
shooting a pigeon down is punk sport hindi said in an 
interview well throw out the rules well give them the pure 
blood sport that theyve become accustomed to one man against one 
man 
tobash said he did not know hindi and the challenge appeared to 
be a publicity stunt 
theres 200 people involved in this tobash said even if 
i would have the duel with him it doesnt mean the other people 
would call off the shoot hes attacking me and i take offense to 
that 
the pigeon shoot has been a tradition for 57 years in hegins 
township a community of nearly 4000 residents about 50 miles 
northwest of allentown 
between 5000 and 8000 pigeons are shot during the daylong 
event which is held to raise money for a 30acre park in hegins 
pigeons that survive the shoot are killed later when their necks 
are snapped by youngsters recruited to do the task 
they think its sportsmanlike said hindi from plano ill 
its barbaric 
in his letter which tobash received tuesday hindi proposed 
that they each put up 10000 and meet in a public place in the 
hegins area for a physical confrontation which would be without 
time limit rules officiating or any protective gear whatsoever 
if tobash were victorious hindi said his 10000 would go 
toward maintaining the hegins community park should hindi prevail 
he proposes that the shoot be canceled and tobashs 10000 be 
forfeited to the park 
the confrontation would end when either man submits or is unable 
to continue hindi proposed 
animalrights advocates have lobbied state legislators annually 
to ban the pigeon shoot but schuylkill county lawmakers have 
killed such efforts 
tobash said the shoot is the most effective way for the town 
to raise money to maintain the park 
we would like to have these groups leave us alone its a 
sporting event he said

rebels fleeing army troops are resorting to a scorched earth 
policy blowing up bridges and buildings and destroying a 
stateowned television station 
deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told reporters that 
government forces were in full control of the east a month after 
new fighting broke out with the separatist tamils 
we are on top of the situation and have destroyed some of 
their key strongholds in the east wijeratne said though adding 
that fighting in the north continues 
in their retreat the rebels are leaving little behind he said 
they are on the run and are resorting to a scorched earth policy 
destroying bridges buildings food stores 
wijeratne said they had destroyed the tv station in kokkavil in 
the north and blew up a key bridge linking the sri lankan mainland 
to mannar island in the northwest 
in other developments the government denied charges that army 
troops killed 50 tamil civilians tuesday in eastern sri lanka 
the tamil eelam liberation organization on wednesday accused the 
army of killing 50 tamil civilians in kalmunai an east coast town 
where about 115 policemen were slain by tamil rebels a month ago 
i am categorically denying a report that troops had lined up 
and shot 50 tamil civilians in kalmunai said gen cyril 
ranatunge the defense secretary we dont do that kind of 
thing

jaffna peninsula as a seesaw battle between the rebels and the 
army they throw a few rockets at us and we throw a few at 
them

the executive director of the abortion clinic 
that lost a landmark us supreme court decision last year has been 
holding talks quietly with the lawyer who wrote the law that 
restricted access to abortion 
bj isaacsonjones of reproductive health services and andrew 
puzder a longtime leader in missouris antiabortion movement 
have discussed over the past eight months letting an antiabortion 
counselor work at the clinic 
they met wednesday with leaders from both sides of the abortion 
debate to get reaction to the idea and determine what to do next 
the meeting sought to explore and answer questions about the 
counselor idea such as who would pay the counselor which patients 
would be counseled and what kind of counseling would be provided 
the two agreed to examine the need for better foster care and 
for better help for handicapped and hardtoplace children as well 
as the idea of putting an antiabortion counselor in the 
reproductive health clinic 
but they said the fact that they found some common ground 
shouldnt be viewed as a victory for either side puzder said 
if anything our talks are a victory for women and children 
he said 
news of the meetings about the counselor idea was disclosed this 
week before then it was difficult to imagine the two talking to 
one another 
puzder a st louis lawyer represented people who satin at 
abortion clinics in the 1970s and 80s he drafted the restrictive 
abortion law at the center of last years landmark webster vs 
reproductive health services supreme court decision which gave 
states more power to restrict a womans right to abortion 
isaacsonjones has long defended a womans right to have an 
abortion her clinic performs nearly half the 18000 abortions each 
year in missouri and sees women from 10 states 
this could be a very good idea or it could die tomorrow 
puzder said what bj and i are doing can be killed very easily 
we are dealing with very delicate politics 
both said it was surprisingly easy to get together and talk 
i was very nervous when i called him but after we talked i 
was encouraged and excited said isaacsonjones who contacted 
puzder after a newspaper column he wrote about the need to help 
women and children 
puzder said he was glad she called 
the first thing we did was say i know that im not going to 
convince you to become prolife and you know that you cant 
convince me to become prochoice he said we got that out of 
the way and were able to talk

ambassador said 
gibson kamau kuria an oxfordeducated human rights lawyer was 
allowed to leave the country wednesday night us ambassador smith

parties 
kenya has long been considered one of africas most stable and 
successful nations but since early this year moi has come under 
increasing pressure to allow a multiparty system

were charged in courts with looting and rioting the paper said 
the us state department on tuesday advised americans against 
all but essential travel to kenya because of the unrest

about 11 top opposition figures were detained 
kuria left the us embassy and kenya at 745 pm wednesday 
night aboard a regularly scheduled airline his immediate

nigeria reportedly has proposed introducing a peacekeeping force 
in liberia pending new elections the rebels who believe they are

criticized the proposal 
what we have in monrovia is a man holding on to a city as

woewiyu said as long as doe is in monrovia there can be no talk 
about ceasefire 
does delegation to the talks was led by tambakai dangaba who

a us supreme court justice has denied actor 
george hamiltons bid to keep his sworn testimony sealed in the 
governments case against imelda marcos and her late husband 
ferdinand 
justice sandra day oconnor who handles emergency appeals to 
the high court from california denied the request wednesday her 
action upheld a ruling tuesday by the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals in san francisco 
the appellate court ruled in favor of the los angeles times 
which sought access to papers concerning hamilton in us district 
court in los angeles the 21 appellate ruling says 
the risk that harm or injury will befall mr hamilton as a 
result of the release of these documents is no greater than the 
risk that all public figures are subject to daily by virtue of the 
fact that their activities may become the subject of favorable or 
unfavorable mention in the news media 
that is a risk that mr hamilton as a sometime motion picture 
and television actor as well as a noted man about town is in any 
event subject to at all times 
the ruling was written by judges dorothy w nelson and stephen 
reinhardt said federal deputy clerk ernie cruz in san francisco 
hamilton was out of the country and unavailable for comment 
said a secretary for his publicist jeffrey lane who also was out 
of his office 
a message left with hamiltons attorney after hours was not 
returned 
hamilton was among 61 unindicted coconspirators named in a 
federal case bought against the marcoses in new york on july 2 
imelda marcos was acquitted of the fraud and racketeering charges 
which alleged she helped loot her country of 168 million 
ferdinand marcos who was indicted with his wife in 1988 died in 
exile in hawaii last fall 
an unindicted coconspirator may have done something to advance 
an alleged criminal conspiracy without necessarily knowing he or 
she was doing it 
in 1981 hamilton bought a beverly hills estate once owned by 
charlie chaplin for 12 million 
he obtained a five year loan based on the propertys increased 
value in late 1983 from calno holdings nv in the netherlands 
antilles which reportedly was tied to the marcoses 
mrs marcos met hamilton at a manila festival in 1982 he 
entertained her at his beverly hills home shopped with the 
philippines first lady and escorted her to parties 
in 1986 after the marcoses fled manila hamilton said mrs 
marcos had no financial interest in his home

sweden today ordered the extradition of 
a 17yearold soviet who hijacked a domestic flight from the soviet 
union by threatening the pilot with what turned out to be a fake 
hand grenade 
dimitry semionov is believed to the first person ordered 
extradited from sweden to the soviet union since the end of world 
war ii 
its a signal to wouldbe hijackers said acting prime 
minister lena hjelmwallen 
the government considered the boys age and possible 
extenuating circumstances but since the crime is very serious we 
decided that we can make no exceptions she said 
semionov hijacked the aircraft on june 9 with 114 passengers and 
seven crew aboard saying he wanted to leave his home in 
byelorussia after a quarrel with his father 
semionov was the first of five soviet youths to hijack soviet 
domestic airliners to sweden or finland since june 9 all of the 
hijackers falsely claimed to be carrying explosives and all 
surrendered peacefully 
swedish airline pilots and police have urged the quick approval 
of soviet requests for extraditions saying delays would encourage 
more hijackings 
semionov told swedish news media wednesday he would commit 
suicide if he were sent home to face hijacking charges he said he 
faces five years in jail and 10 years of banishment from major 
cities in the soviet union if convicted 
prisons official lisbet lindberg said extra guards were placed 
on semionov who was being held in kronoberg jail 
government spokesman lars danielsson said the youth would be 
extradited as soon as soviet authorities are prepared 
also today helsinkis flight control center said a hijacked 
soviet airliner approached finnish air space but turned back to 
leningrad apparently after a hijacking attempt was foiled no 
further details were available about the plane which had been on a 
domestic flight from leningrad to the northern city of murmansk on 
tuesday the flight control center said a hijacked soviet plane 
headed toward finland but changed course and returned to leningrad

tens of thousands of coal miners returned to work 
today following a oneday strike to press demands that the 
communist party to get out of their lives and the soviet government 
resign 
according to strike organizers workers were back on the job in 
the ukraines don river coal basin the kuznets basin of western 
siberia and vorkuta in the far north 
all of the miners are working said nikolai volynko a 
strike organizer in donetsk the center of the ukrainian mining 
region 
miners spokesmen in the other regions contacted by telephone 
said that mining operations were back to normal 
miners staged the 24hour walkout despite appeals from the 
soviet government and party 
in donetsk a rally passed a resolution wednesday demanding that 
the government of prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov resign that 
party cells be removed from mines economic enterprises the kgb 
army and police and that party property be nationalized 
we should kick the party not only out of the ukraine but 
everywhere declared mine construction worker viktor kitenko 
speaking at the rally 
no figures were available on the number of miners who actually 
walked off their jobs but judging from the number of mines on 
strike in the donetsk region it appeared that about 100000 miners 
stayed away strike organizers claimed that about 300000 miners 
took part in western siberia 
ryzhkov today told the communist partys 28th congress meeting 
in moscow that 276 enterprises and 655 branches took part in the 
strike 
he said workers at 230 mines stayed off the job all day and 
elsewhere the walkout lasted from two to 12 hours 
in light of what happened yesterday we must quickly work out 
conclusions he said 
the job action was a repetition of a long and bitter strike coal 
miners conducted last summer to press the soviet government for 
better supplies of basic consumer goods better pay and working 
conditions the government acceded to their demands but has been 
unable to fulfill its promises 
mikhail shchadov minister of the coal mining industry said in 
a newspaper interview wednesday that the government was trying to 
give mines more independence improve housing vacations and 
construction of schools 
but he acknowledged shortages in the soviet economy and said 
that a lack of timber to properly construct mine shafts had led to 
some deaths underground

from the surprise visitor at republican party 
headquarters came a notsosurprising message 
republicans always do better when were on the offensive 
party chairman lee atwater told his audience get back on the 
offensive 
it was simple but welcome advice from a man whose trusted 
political instincts have been sorely missed by the party which 
convenes for its midyear meeting today in chicago infighting over 
taxes has exposed cracks in the gops fabled unity and democrats 
have gotten more aggressive about taking on the republicans 
for the past four months however atwater has been missing from 
the partys daytoday operation battling a lifethreatening brain 
tmor aides say his condition has improved but atwater was 
readmitted to george washington university hospital on wednesday 
for testing 
atwater was hospitalized overnight for routine testing 
according to his press secretary leslie goodman this is nothing 
out of the ordinary everything is great she said there is a 
consensus among his doctors that the tumor is not growing 
when atwater was elected gop chairman 18 months ago bush said 
he will be my political eyes and ears with that the president 
effectively moved the white house political operation across town 
to the republican national committee 
atwater stays in daily touch with his office and the white 
house and keeps tabs on major campaigns by tapping his extensive 
network of gop contacts across the country he spent much of monday 
participating in conference calls with rnc members preparing for 
the chicago meeting 
hes in the loop on all the big decisions and strategy 
sessions but hes just not able to work full time said gop 
consultant charles black who has been helping top atwater deputy 
mary matalin run the rnc in atwaters absence 
but atwater 39 has been to the white house just once and to 
his office only once since he collapsed at a political breakfast in 
march known for his energy and zeal atwater now tires easily 
because of his exhausting medical treatment 
he gets most of his information over the phone from meetings at 
his house or during drives with aides and gop political operatives 
it was during a drive two weeks ago with ed rogers a top white 
house political aide that atwater decided to make a surprise visit 
to his office he whisked his wheelchair in for a 45minute 
strategy session with matalin rogers and others 
frustrated with white house handling of bushs decision to back 
away from his no new taxes pledge and with democratic attacks 
on gop involvement in the savings and loan crisis atwater told 
those at the meeting that republicans needed to be more aggressive 
get back on the offensive one participant quoted atwater as 
saying that also was the theme recently of one of his frequent 
memos to white house chief of staff john sununu 
few believe atwater could have convinced bush to hold firm on 
taxes but many within the party think he would have handled the 
sensitive switch more deftly than did the white house bush was 
kept away from reporters for two days after the tax announcement 
took most republicans by surprise and undermined gop candidates 
running on no new taxes planks 
lee would not have sent the president into a bunker for two 
days said an atwater loyalist who asked not to be identified 
it gave the impression they were trying to hide from the 
decision 
black said atwater had put a 1990 plan in place that has allowed 
others to run the party in his absence with little disruption 
where atwater is most missed black and others said is in the 
partys relations with the press and on the fundraising circuit 
everyone had come to learn to look to lee he was the voice of 
the party said matalin 
should his recovery allow it the decision on whether to return 
to work full time will be atwaters according to party officials 
his doctors believe they have stopped the tumors growth but it 
could be months before they know whether aggressive radiation 
treatment has killed the tumor 
atwater will have to decide by the partys january meeting 
whether to seek a second twoyear term

leaders of the worlds seven richest democracies 
struck agreements to help the soviet union reduce farm supports 
and stem the pollution which causes global warming or did they 
wednesdays final declaration of the threeday economic summit 
contains all these promises and more but as usual the document 
was heavy on the manana tactic long invoked by allies who have 
sharp differences but want harmony in their parting anthems 
consider this 
with three of the seven nations the united states britain and 
japan vehemently opposed to direct financial aid for the soviets 
the leaders decided to send a team of experts to study the 
kremlins economic needs and report by the end of the year 
and what then 
asked whether the united states would help president mikhail s 
gorbachev if the study recommends giving him cash bush replied 
not necessarily but maybe this will lead to support 
in deference to bush and british prime minister margaret 
thatcher the summit set conditions for any coordinated direct aid 
program reductions in military spending and support for client 
states like cuba 
french president francois mitterrand chafing along with italy 
and west germany about the refusal to provide direct aid said with 
typical gallic fatalism that the sixmonth deadline was the best 
we could hope for he also dismissed the preconditions as 
negligible 
mitterrand also said the study was a good idea because it was 
better to fully understand soviet needs before the west does extend 
cash assistance that may be but it hasnt stopped west germany or 
canada which have already promised the soviets loans and credits 
worth more than 5 million 
another agreement trumpeted by the leaders was compromise 
language designed to resolve a fight between the united state and 
the europeans over farm subsidies 
bush had sought their elimination the europeans balked willing 
only to reduce some of the supports and warning that cutting off 
the supports could cost up to 3 million farmers their livelihood 
each side got a little of what it wanted but no one was fooled 
into thinking the problem was solved and the real test will only 
begin when negotiators meet in geneva at the end of the month to 
try to translate the communique language into action before the 
dec 31 deadline for completion of a global trade agreement 
im not under any illusions that well be dealing with a new 
era by christmas or even by next spring was the assessment by 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
the summit communique was particularly noncommittal on the 
question of how to deal with global warming the leaders agreed it 
was a pressing problem and that the emissions believed responsible 
for the problem should be limited 
but they declined to set limits basically because the bush 
administration opposed the europeans demand and deferred all 
significant action until after a convention on climate change is 
reached in 1992 
reporters suggestions of procrastination on soviet aid farm 
subsidies and the environment drew irate reaction from the leaders 
at their windup news conferences 
its not an effort to delay anything said bush in response 
to a question about the study of soviet economic needs 
margaret thatcher suggested another interpretation 
the greatest achievement of the summit has been to make it 
easier for all of us to reject shortterm soft options in favor of 
longerterm solutions she said 
and what looks like procrastination to some has some distinct 
advantages for bush 
by leaving wiggle room on questions like aid to the soviet union 
and china bush has space to maneuver with congress and likely a 
better chance to fulfill his own foreign policy objectives 
lawmakers have made clear they wouldnt support money for 
gorbachev both for ideological reasons and because of a gaping 
budget deficit they have also lashed out at any hint that bush is 
trying to ease sanctions against china imposed last year as 
punishment for its repression of prodemocracy reforms 
but bush has said he doesnt want china isolated and is 
probably privately pleased with the policy evolving out of japan 
where prime minister toshiki kaifu has decided to resume a 52 
billion lending program to beijing bush and the others said they 
wouldnt stand in the way 
and west germany whose pockets are full and constituents are 
eager is well positioned to help gorbachev where bush cant

monkey business was the order of the day much 
to the dismay of defense attorneys in a state judges courtroom 
four orangutans used by entertainer bobby berosini in his 
stardust hotel act were bought into the courtroom wednesday and 
shown to jurors as berosinis lawsuit against people for the 
ethical treatment of animals opened in district court 
berosini claims peta defamed him by secretly filming him 
allegedly beating the orangutans backstage at his show last year 
then releasing the tape to the media 
jurors smiled and others in the crowded courtroom laughed as 
berosini ran his charges through their motions calling each 
orangutan to a podium to lift their arms and display themselves to 
the panel 
but attorneys for the defendants were not as happy claiming the 
appearance biased jurors by portraying the orangutans and berosini 
as one big happy family 
it was a complete zoo defense attorney daniel foley 
protested to judge myron leavitt this was nothing but a big show 
for the jury 
it does show that they are powerful animals but i think the 
jury has a right to see that too leavitt said the jury has a 
right to see what kind of animals they are 
a trio of defense attorneys took turns asking first for a 
mistrial then for leavitt to disqualify himself as the two sides 
opened what is expected to be a twoweek trial 
peta attorney phil hirschkop claimed leavitt was biased against 
the organization and should disqualify himself because he is a 
close friend of the operator of the stardust hotel which is not a 
plaintiff and took a 25000 campaign contribution from the resort 
i know we cant get a fair trial hirschkop said we have 
no chance of winning in this courtroom 
leavitt refused to disqualify himself 
i have no personal bias or prejudice for or against any 
parties in this case the judge said 
the appearance by the orangutans came after jurors were taken 
backstage at the stardust to view the area where the secret 
videotape was made last summer 
the videotape shows berosini apparently striking some of the 
orangutans with what peta officials claimed was a metal rod 
berosini denied abusing the animals and claims peta ruined his 
career by releasing the videotape he later was cleared by federal 
officials of any wrongdoing involving the orangutans 
stardust officials later said they would close the show next 
year after a more than three decade run but denied it was because 
of the controversy

two ships were cruising toward albania today to pick 
up thousands of asylumseekers who took refuge in foreign embassies 
there 
in order to prevent a mass exodus from the communist nation 
officials gave few details about the operation 
an italian foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that the 
albanian authorities reserved for themselves the right to decide 
at the last minute when they will allow the ships into port 
early release of details on the boatlift could cause other 
albanians to rush to get on board and it would be a thing of 
biblical proportions the spokesman said on condition of 
anonymity 
an italianchartered ferry left wednesday for albania to carry 
away many of the estimated 4000 people who clambered over embassy 
fences in the capital of tirana to escape europes last hardline 
communist nation 
the orient star a maltese boat chartered by france set sail 
early today from the greek port of patras for durres greek port 
authority spokesman frangiscos vomviras said 
a third ship was also expected to sail today from southern italy 
people began seeking refuge in the embassies june 28 some 
braving police gunfire albania agreed to let them leave after 
conditions worsened at the compounds supplies of food and medicine 
are strained and hygienic conditions poor 
the first group of 51 people to leave the country flew to 
czechoslovakia on monday 
albania has resisted the democratic reforms that swept the rest 
of eastern europe last year despite limited restructuring this 
year by communist leader ramiz alia albania remains europes most 
backward and isolated nation 
trying to stem popular discontent the government in the past 
week has replaced highranking officials including several 
hardliners associated with the late communist ruler enver hoxha 
on wednesday more reform was announced 
the state news agency ata said the government would allow some 
privatization of handicrafts and small trade but entrepreneurs 
could not employ nonfamily members and had to register with the 
authorities 
as part of the boatlift the italianchartered ship appia left 
venice on wednesday carrying nine nurses and three doctors from 
the red cross said lino de rosa a director of the company that 
owns the ships 
the frenchchartered ship was carrying 44 french officials 
doctors and 3 tons of medical supplies and food said vomviras it 
was to arrive off durres later today then return with the refugees 
to the french port of marseille 
another vessel the espresso grecia was to leave from the 
southern italian city of brindisi later today de rosa said 
the ships were to wait in durres harbor until the albanians 
decide to let them dock late today or early friday foreign 
ministry officials said 
new arrivals at the embassies have dropped off dramatically 
since police placed a cordon around the embassy quarter this week 
diplomats said 
many of the asylumseekers in tirana have said they eventually 
want to emigrate to the united states which does not have 
diplomatic relations with albania 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the united states has no specific quota for albanian refugees 
but has a ceiling of 6500 on refugees from eastern europe so far 
this year 52 albanian refugees have resettled in the united 
states boucher said

today to push society rapidly forward but acknowledged that some 
hasty moves in the past have hurt the party and the people 
in his first meeting with reporters after being elected deputy 
to mikhail s gorbachev vladimir a ivashko showed himself to be a 
loyal and emphatic supporter of the soviet leaders policies 
endorsed by gorbachev the 58yearold ivashko soundly defeated 
party traditionalist yegor k ligachev on wednesday for the newly 
created post of deputy secretary general 
he said he only learned tuesday he was gorbachevs choice for 
deputy and has not yet had a chance to map out his exact 
responsibilities with the soviet leader the deputy secretary 
general is responsible for the daytoday affairs of the party 
i am for moving forward fast ivashko said at his first news 
conference i see no other option there is no way back 
he said he would try to avoid a split in the party ranks by 
trying to find room for people with widely varying points of view 
but ivashko also said the party had to avoid repeating the many 
mistakes it made in the first years of gorbachevs rule 
i am against illconceived leaps forward backwards 
sideways he said perestroika proves that we have made many 
erroneous decisions quickly designed to solve all problems 
perestroika is gorbachevs policy of economic and social 
restructuring 
he said the 1985 drive against alcoholism gorbachevs first 
largescale reform effort caused huge moral and financial 
damage and damage to the health of the people the national 
treasury lost billions in alcohol sales and the campaign encouraged 
moonshiners whose lowquality brew killed and injured many people 
ivashko an economist and engineer also said the soviet 
government should not have agreed to the demands of striking coal 
miners last year that it knew it could not fulfill 
the miners anger has since become more political and on 
wednesday hundreds of thousands of miners struck for one day to 
demand the resignation of the government the nationalization of 
communist party property and the removal of party organizations 
from mines offices the kgb the army and the police 
in the donetsk coal fields of the eastern ukraine striking 
miners cheered wednesday when they heard that ivashko might be 
heading to moscow

we can support him yuri makarov a donetsk strike organizer 
told a news conference 
on wednesday before his election to the party post ivashko 
submitted his resignation as the ukraines president in a dispute 
with the republics parliament 
miners in the ukraines donetsk basin the soviet unions 
biggest coalproducing region admit they dont know ivashko well 
because he had only been in the ukrainian leadership since last 
fall 
nevertheleass they consider him part of the communist party and 
government apparatus that has failed to improve their living and 
working conditions 
have you been around to the stores 34yearold anatoly 
berezhnikov who has spent 13 years in the mines asked a reporter 
who sought his view of ivashko without awaiting an answer he 
offered theyre empty 
a native of poltava ivashko graduated from the kharkov mining 
institute and joined the communist party in 1960 he became a 
candidate member of the partys central committee in 1986 shortly 
after gorbachev came to power 
ivashko was promoted to full voting membership in april 1989 
when 110 mostly elderly conservatives were retired earlier that 
year top communists picked ivashko for one of the partys 100 
guaranteed seats in the new congress of peoples deputies

to vigorously participate in the effort to normalize the

a senior member of prime minister margaret 
thatchers cabinet said today he regretted calling west germanys 
government uppity and saying its economic policy was intended 
to take over the whole of europe 
in a magazine interview that provoked widespread demands for his 
resignation trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley also 
compared the european community to adolf hitler 
mrs thatcher speaking at a rowdy session in the house of 
commons this afternoon said ridleys remarks did not reflect 
government policy nor her own views but she rebuffed demands for 
his dismissal 
on reflection i very much regret the remarks reported in the 
spectator and unreservedly withdraw them ridley said in a 
onesentence statement issued by his department in london 
in bonn west germany lutz stavenhagen a highranking aide to 
chancellor helmut kohl said the attacks were scandalous by 
accusing germany of seeking to dominate europe lutz said ridley 
discredits the entire european community 
ridley was in budapest today with a british trade mission 
in the interview ridley condemned what he called the 
breathtaking arrogance of the european community 
im not against giving up sovereignty in principle but not to 
this lot you might just as well give it to adolf hitler 
frankly he told the spectator magazine in an interview published 
today 
this rushed takeover by the germans on the worst possible 
basis with the french behaving like poodles to the germans is 
absolutely intolerable ridley was quoted as saying 
the magazines cover carried a cartoon of ridley painting a 
hitler mustache on a portrait of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
several members of the british and european parliaments demanded 
this morning that mrs thatcher remove ridley from the cabinet 
i think the prime minister has no choice to but ask him to 
resign said hugh dykes a conservative party member in the house 
of commons 
unless mrs thatcher gets rid of him today one can only take 
it that she secretly endorses his attitude said gerald kaufman 
the opposition labor partys spokesman on foreign affairs 
in strasbourg france leaders of the european parliaments 
180strong socialist group the largest in the 518seat body sent 
a letter to thatcher demanding ridleys resignation 
in the interview ridley said the west german governments 
support for european monetary union is all a german racket 
designed to take over the whole of europe it has to be thwarted 
mrs thatcher and fellow conservatives like ridley have been 
reluctant to go along with european community moves toward full 
political and economic integration fearing a loss of control over 
domestic policy 
following ridleys remark about hitler spectator editor dominic 
lawson suggested kohl was much less threatening hes not going 
to bomb us after all lawson said 
ridley reportedly replied im not sure i wouldnt rather have 
er the shelters and the chance to fight back than simply 
being taken over by economics hell soon be coming here and 
trying to say that this is what we should do on the banking front 
and this is what our taxes should be i mean hell soon be trying 
to take over everything 
ridley was asked if his views were colored by the fact that at 
age 61 he could remember world war ii 
jolly good thing too ridley was quoted as replying about 
time somebody said that it was pretty nasty only two months ago i 
was in auschwitz poland next week im in czechoslovakia you ask 
them what they think about the second world war its useful to 
remember 
britains historic role had been to play the balance of power in 
europe ridley said and never has it been more necessary than 
now with germany so uppity 
in his remarks ridley criticized the 17 members of the european 
commission which governs the european community 
seventeen unelected reject politicians with no accountability 
to anybody who are not responsible for raising taxes just 
spending money who are pandered to by a supine parliament which 
also is not responsible for raising taxes already behaving with an 
arrogance i find breathtaking the idea that one says ok well 
give this lot our sovereignty is unacceptable to me

in 1933 but it was never revoked because of a 57year 
administrative mess and the ousted communist leaderships fear of 
causing a public scandal adn said 
records showed officials assumed shortly after world war ii that 
the issue had been settled under decrees issued by the soviet 
military administrators of what is now east germany 
however those red army decrees on denazification made no 
specific mention of the honorary citizenships the agency said 
when the problem finally came to light in the city council in 
1988 the matter was quietly relegated to the archives adn said 
hitler committed suicide during the april 1945 red army siege of 
berlin goering killed himself in 1946 shortly before his 
scheduled execution in nuremberg for war crimes 
erwin motzkus mayor of this city on berlins southwestern 
outskirts recommended that potsdam councilors revoke the honorary 
citizenships during their next session on aug 15 adn said 
last week the east german city of rostock revoked the honorary 
citizen title it had bestowed on hitler adn reported 
the action came after the new city council elected in rostocks 
first democratic elections in may appointed a committee to 
investigate the citys list of honorary citizens

negotiators for the government and 
striking unions agreed early today to end a strike that tore up 
city streets brought commerce to a halt and left at least six 
people dead 
the accord was signed by negotiators for president violeta 
barrios de chamorro and the sandinistaled national workers front 
ending the biggest challenge so far to mrs chamorros 10weekold 
government 
the strike took hold july 2 and spread through most government 
ministries and many state businesses strike leaders claimed 90000 
took part 
the sandinistas who left office april 25 after a february 
defeat at the polls remain the largest single political force in 
nicaragua 
in its settlement the government agreed to suspend a decree 
permitting the return of confiscated lands to previous owners it 
also agreed to a 43 percent salary raise in july and another 
increase of undetermined size for august 
under the pact public sector workers fired since mrs chamorro 
took office april 25 will be paid and there will be no retribution 
against the strikers 
the sandinistas had opposed the layoffs ordered by the 
usbacked government which is trying to cut the budget deficit 
and nurse back to health an economy ravaged by a decade of war and 
us trade sanctions 
opposition was also strong in the country of 37 million people 
to government plans to sell many of the properties the sandinistas 
confiscated and nationalized after coming to power in a 1979 
popular revolution 
the strike closed the international airport cut electricity and 
water service limited telephone and mail delivery reduced 
gasoline supplies and shut down factories and businesses 
it was the second major strike and the most violent in mrs 
chamorros administration at least six people were reported killed 
and 100 injured in fighting between strikers and government 
supporters since friday 
on wednesday barricadebuilding and gunfighting in the streets 
of managua that had occurred in recent days appeared to have 
subsided there were no large crowds out at night as earlier in the 
week 
a public sector strike in may resulted in 100 percent raises and 
other important concessions the raises helped offset high 
inflation in nicaragua where the average workers salary is only 
about 100 a month 
the minimum salary is about 20 a month and inflation was 
officially listed at 1247 percent for the month of june 
the latest strike was initially called to protest the firings of 
government workers and to demand a voice in government economic 
policy which they say favors the wealthy under the new government 
those demands were met in part through the indemnification and 
the land redistribution issue 
the government had proclaimed the strike illegal claiming it 
was politically motivated 
workers were returning to their jobs today the streets of many 
neighborhoods remained torn up where sandinista backers had used 
the paving stones for barricades 
the unions that called the strikes the army and police are all 
loyal to the leftist sandinistas who ruled the country for a 
decade until their february loss at the polls the us economic 
embargo that helped create shortages even in basic foodstuffs 
contributed to their defeat 
mrs chamorro won with the backing of a 14party coalition that 
ranged from far right to communist and had little more in common 
than a distaste for the sandinistas 
the us trade sanctions and a ninewar against the 
ussupported contra rebels devastated the economy before mrs 
chamorro took office and her reconstruction efforts have stirred 
resentment and opposition 
talks got under way wednesday night with antonio lacayo a 
soninlaw and close aide of mrs chamorro representing the 
government and sandinista labor center leader lucio jimenez heading 
the union team

the nations last known handcrank 
party line was disconnected today when residents of central idahos 
rugged salmon river canyon received privateline touchtone 
service 
its sure nice country store owner garry pedrow said in 
answering the first incoming call im not screaming anymore 
public utilities commission president joe miller made the first 
call out from pedrows store to gary c byrne administrator of the 
rural electrification administration which financed the switch 
the depressionera system had grown familiar and residents 
greeted the change with mixed emotions 
i hate to see the historical value of it leave but as far as 
being in business its hard to communicate on this line pedrow 
yelled into the mouthpiece wednesday 
pedrows shoup country store is near north fork about 200 miles 
northeast of boise he and 17 yearround neighbors depended on the 
magnetooperated system and switchboard operator steve freestone to 
talk to each other and the outside world 
at first they resisted efforts to do away with the phones but 
eventually they agreed the convenience of modern privateline 
touchtone service was more important 
the new system which required 40 miles of underground cable 
laid over several months made an immediate difference 
it sounds great said joyce rinehart at the ramshead motel 
and restaurant now that i know its working im going to call 
my mother back in iowa 
everybodys got a list a mile long of people they want to 
call said david hobson a technician who worked on the 
modernization project 
the fate of the old system was cast a year ago when atampt 
announced that computerization would force elimination of the 
switchboard operator freestone operates the switchboard from his 
motel deluxe in salmon about 20 miles from the canyon 
the residents along 34 miles of the canyon used the system like 
an intercom to talk among themselves without help but freestone 
was their link beyond the wilderness 
he placed outgoing calls and fielded incoming ones directing 
calls to the right customers through a system of coded rings 
pedrows store for instance was three longs 
theyre sad to see the last crank phone system being taken 
out but theyre glad to get better service freestone said 
that lines been so bad its a raggedy old thing theyve got 
it nailed to trees and mountains most of the time you have to yell 
pretty loud to talk to people down river 
the system originally was set up by the us forest service in 
1931 and was sold to a cooperative for 1 in 1952 
in their heyday such wallmounted phones consisting of a 
black metal mouthpiece on an arm and a receiver hung on a twoprong 
hook represented the communications heart of as many as 12 
million american farms and ranches 
a crank on the right side rang bells along the line an operator 
could be reached with persistent cranking 
each customer was to answer just his own coded ring while 
ignoring the rest but party line chatter with two or three people 
talking and several more secretly listening was a popular rural 
recreation long before electricity television and even radio 
a line call of continuous ringing was often used to alert 
families of emergencies like approaching storms tornadoes or 
forest fires 
the crank phones fit in well with the lifestyle in the isolated 
canyon where residents need generators for electricity and have 
only seasonal running water 
in the beginning some of the people said they didnt want to 
lose the crank system said mike martell of rural telephone co 
who coordinated cablelaying for the new system there were a few 
ideas and they werent even feasible but the people are real 
happy now theyre ready to get off the old system 
pedrows wife peggy agreed 
once its gone its gone forever she said but at this 
point right now i guess im ready because i cant hear anything on 
it

mohawk warriors dug trenches and reinforced 
barricades with crushed police cars today one day after fighting a 
gun battle with police over a golf course addition the indians say 
encroaches on tribal land 
a police officer was shot and killed wednesday morning when the 
4monthold dispute between mohawks and officials from this town 
near montreal escalated into a shootout 
both sides accused each other of opening fire first 
about 100 police moved to dismantle a barricade of cement blocks 
and barbed wire the indians had built on an access road to the 
disputed land 
however the police were driven back during an exchange of 
gunfire with 200 armed mohawks wearing war paint 
officials were unsure whether the slain police officer cpl 
marcel lemay 31 was shot by a mohawk or a fellow policeman 
after the fight the indians dug defensive trenches with a 
commandeered earth mover and brought in reinforcements from other 
reservations they patrolled the edge of the golf course in stolen 
golf carts preparing for another attack 
down the hill dozens of police wearing flack jackets and 
carrying shotguns patrolled their new sandbagged positions 
reinforced with concrete blocks during the night police brought 
in hundreds of additional officers 
the mohawks claim title to a small pine forest the leaders of 
oka a picturesque town 18 miles west of montreal want to cut down 
so the golf course can add nine holes the police had intervened at 
the request of okas mayor 
the mohawks said late wednesday that quebec security minister 
sam elkas had promised them police would not attack during the 
night or this morning unless they were fired on first 
several mohawks confirmed late wednesday that mohawk warriors 
from the kahnawake reserve south of montreal and the akwesasne 
reserve south of cornwall ontario had arrived as reinforcements 
no figures were immediately available 
i know that if they police come in well be ready for 
them said harvey a mohawk who declined to give his last name 
the indians took advantage of the police retreat to seize four 
police cars and two vans then used the commandeered earth mover to 
crush the vehicles forming a barricade on a hill across the main 
highway through the region 
their position overlooked a police roadblock at the bottom of 
the hill

received saying only believe me he is much better 
in other developments the wives of seven prominent kenyans 
four of whose husbands recently were detained without charge for 
criticizing the government pleaded with mandela to intervene on 
their behalf and urge president daniel arap moi to free the men 
what is even more painful than the imprisonment of the black 
man by the white man is the unjustified imprisonment of the black 
man by the black man the wives said in a onepage letter to 
mandela 
mandela who is a guest at mois official residence arrived 
wednesday following four days of violence in which at least 28 
people were killed the fighting was sparked by a weekend 
prodemocracy rally dispersed by security forces with guns and tear 
gas after demonstrators attacked a police officer 
mandela was scheduled to leave saturday for mozambique the last 
leg of a grueling sixweek tour through north america europe and 
africa he plans to return to south africa in time for his 72nd 
birthday july 18

refused to comment on reports that mandela had sought hospital 
treatment wednesday 
mandela 71 arrived in kenya from addis ababa ethiopia one 
day earlier than planned and anc officials in south africa said 
the change was prompted by a slight case of pneumonia 
all medical reports we have received indicate that comrade 
mandela is comfortable and is expected to be able to resume his 
duties within a few days said the anc statement released in 
johannesburg 
concerns about mandelas health have arisen previously and he 
has had to postpone or cancel several events due to fatigue he 
underwent surgery in june to have a benign cyst removed from his 
bladder and doctors have expressed concern about his heart 
mandela was jailed for 27 years for opposing south africas 
whiteled government in 1988 he was hospitalized for tuberculosis

race before being allowed to talk on the air lennox said he said 
he took the action after he described the theft to listeners and 
reported that a black man was a suspect 
callers talked about their experiences as victims of crime and 
how to avoid becoming a victim but nearly half were critical of 
lennox for banning blacks the birmingham postherald reported 
the rev abraham woods president of the birmingham chapter of 
the southern christian leadership conference said he would demand 
an apology from lennox 
that was uncalledfor action on his part woods said it 
really bordered on stupidity in this day and time 
lennox said he could not explain his action 
on the spur of the moment i said lets not take calls from 
any blacks he said 
it was interesting the reaction to it said lennox who has 
worked in radio for 15 years i had my boss sticking his head in 
the door if nothing else it says something about the racial

unswayed by visions of a peace dividend france 
has declared its intent to field western europes strongest army 
and retain an independent nuclear arsenal based on the deterrence 
strategy of the cold war 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement a socialist admired by 
conservatives has rejected demands for spending cuts and says 
france should never again retreat into the defensive passive 
strategies that led to its defeat in world war ii 
on saturday the pride of the french army 7000 soldiers from 
elite units 340 armored vehicles and scores of warplanes and 
combat helicopters are scheduled to march roll and fly over the 
champselysees in celebration of bastille day 
there are no plans for counterdemonstrations france never 
experienced the antinuclear protests that mushroomed throughout 
western europe in the mid1980s but there are signs of some 
cracks in the longstanding consensus on military policy 
the finance ministry and the governing socialists left wing are 
asking for substantial military spending cuts to reflect the 
collapse of sovietbacked regimes in eastern europe and the reduced 
threat from moscow 
chevenement has also become a prime target for some elements of 
the press 
le canarde enchaine a satirical weekly carried a frontpage 
cartoon this week showing french and soviet generals each shouting 
we dont want to disarm the cartoon also featured chevenement 
devising a solution a disneyland with real bullets in which 
the two armies can blast away at each other to their hearts 
content 
francois heisbourg a frenchman who is director of the 
londonbased international institute of strategic studies said 
france unlike its allies has a basic unwillingness to consider 
major choices in restructuring its forces 
france waged the wrong kind of war in 1940 heisbourg said in a 
telephone interview and we may now being fighting the wrong kind 
of peace 
an example he said was frances decision to press ahead with 
the development of the shortrange hades nuclear missile even 
though its range extends no farther than germany 
chevenement has refused to join optimistic assessments that the 
world is becoming a safer place he foresees a dangerous strategic 
vacuum developing in europe over the next five years with the 
specter of instability crossborder ethnic violence and 
potentially virulent nationalism 
france he said last weekend must maintain all its 
capabilities 
foremost in the french military arsenal is the independent 
nuclear force that has been preserved and improved by all french 
leaders since the 1960s 
france has insisted on maintaining total sovereignty over its 
nuclear strategy and has refused to endorse the north atlantic 
treaty organizations recent declaration that it would use nuclear 
weapons only as a last resort 
despite the crumbling of the warsaw pact france is sticking by 
its cold war policy of nuclear deterrence according to military 
headquarters this requires the ability to inflict damage on the 
aggressors population and industrial capacity damage at least 
equal to that suffered by france 
the nuclear arsenal is tested and upgraded regularly and 
consumes an estimated onethird of all money spent on defense 
equipment 
the french army maintains a force of about 470000 soldiers 
sailors and airmen 
france produces most of its own armaments and is the worlds no 
3 weapons exporter 
france also aspires to a global military role it guards 
territories in the caribbean the indian ocean and the south 
pacific deploys more than 6000 soldiers in africa under bilateral 
treaties has sent warships on relief missions to lebanon and 
recently established a joint francegerman brigade in west germany 
although a strong advocate of european unity president francois 
mitterrand president since 1981 has rejected suggestions that 
france return to the integrated military structure of nato 
chevenement has not been totally inflexible last weekend he 
said 35000 soldiers would be trimmed from the military by 1995 and 
offered to consider reducing mandatory military service from 12 
months to 10 
but he balked at reconsidering major weapons programs or making 
major cuts in the proposed 1991 defense budget of 36 billion 35 
percent of the gross domestic product and about 16 percent of the 
total national budget 
such an expense chevenement said is a small price to pay for 
freedom

a 42yearold man with aids wanted to leave 
something behind when he died so in april he planted 15 trees in a 
city park he recently discovered 11 were destroyed 
philip risko said he found that city workers five weeks ago had 
leveled or bent the 4 to6foot saplings while mowing to cut grass 
and weeds 
it was heartbreaking he said 
he said city workers told him they saw the trees but did not 
have instructions to take the extra time to mow around them he 
complained to the city but was told he needed a permit to plant 
anything in a city park 
william darnell supervisor of forestry and landscape for the 
parks and recreation department said it was likely the workers 
would knock over the trees because they were not supposed to be 
planted 
all we can say is theres nothing we can say darnell said 
thank you but that wasnt the way to do that

a state appeals court today unanimously 
upheld gov mario cuomos agreement to have the state buy the 
shoreham nuclear power plant for 1 and dismantle it 
the 50 decision from the appellate division of state supreme 
court upheld two lower court rulings in cuomos favor 
the shoreham plant built at a cost of more than 55 billion 
has never operated at anything above lowlevel test power the 
plant located in suffolk county on long island was built by the 
long island lighting company and brought the company to the brink 
of bankruptcy 
cuomo argued that shoreham was unsafe to operate because its 
location on a heavily populated island made an emergency evacuation 
impractical cuomo reached the agreement with lilco to scrap the 
plant in 1989 
our decision is not meant to be a judgment on any partys 
position regarding nucleargenerated power generally or shoreham 
specifically said the appeals court in an unsigned opinion it 
is simply an assessment of the authority granted by the legislature 
and how that authority has been exercised 
martin kaufman a lawyer for the atlantic legal foundation said 
he wasnt yet certain whether his group would attempt to appeal the 
ruling to new yorks highest court the court of appeals 
the foundation a conservativeoriented organization had been 
joined in the lawsuit by the us justice department and other 
supporters of not abandoning shoreham 
obviously this loss is not helpful said kaufman

some infants living near the hanford 
nuclear reservation in the 1940s may have received more radiation 
than people living near nevada nuclear weapons testing sites a 
scientist said today 
john till chairman of a panel trying to estimate doses of 
radiation to people living near the federal weapons production 
reservation said some infants may have received 2900 rads of 
radioactive iodine over three years 
a rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue and is 
roughly equal to the radiation in 12 chest xrays the nuclear 
regulatory commission requires that facilities it licenses limit 
yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15 thousandths 
of a rad 
release of the study came one day after the department of energy 
acknowledged for the first time that hanford leaked radiation at 
levels that endangered the health of nearby residents 
now that theyve admitted what theyve done i think they 
should make restitution and they should provide medical help for 
the rest of our lives for anything the radiation has caused said 
betty perkes whose family farms near pasco wash i feel like 
they used us for guinea pigs and i dont feel like they cared one 
iota what happened to us either or our families 
however it would be very difficult to prove a longterm illness 
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and the law prohibits 
lawsuits against the government said jim thomas of the spokane 
washbased hanford education action league 
the study was not intended to identify health risks from 
radiation exposure but till said the numbers were high enough to 
strongly justify a study of thyroid diseases among socalled 
downwinders who lived near hanford during periods when it was 
spewing radioactive particles into the atmosphere in large 
quantities 
the study of 270000 people living in 10 counties of washington 
and oregon near the reservation in southcentral washington 
indicated that 13500 people received cumulative doses greater than 
33 rad in the years 194447 
these numbers are significant because that is a lot of 
folks till said at a news conference before the actual release 
of the study that dose level is significant enough to strongly 
justify a thyroid dose study 
radioactive iodine was released when spent reactor fuel rods 
were chemically dissolved to separate weaponsgrade plutonium and 
uranium when it concentrates in the thyroid gland iodine131 can 
cause cancer and other diseases 
till said that by comparison doses downwind from the nevada 
nuclear weapons testing site ranged from a few rad to 500 rad 
the hanford environmental dose reconstruction project uses 
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when 
plutonium was produced for nuclear weapons 
i know of no other releases of this magnitude from any other 
us facility till said of the 194447 period noting that 
modern releases are extremely small 
a small number of infants may have received as much as 2900 rad 
during that time till said infants were particularly vulnerable 
to radioactive iodine because their thyroids were not as developed 
as an adults and they likely drank more milk produced by cows 
that grazed on grass contaminated by radioactive iodine 
of the 270000 people studied half received doses of less than 
17 rad over the three years and half received doses greater than 
that of the upper half 13500 got doses greater than 33 rad till 
said 
because of prevailing westtoeast winds the affected area lies 
roughly east of hanford with larger radiation doses affecting 
those who lived closest to the reservation till said 
the 10 counties covered in the study were yakima kittitas 
grant adams benton franklin walla walla and klickitat in 
washington state and morrow and umatilla in oregon some of the 
counties are included entirely others only partly 
the panel also studied radiation doses to 70000 people exposed 
through water in the columbia river which borders part of the 
reservation and found that the average dose to the 
gastrointestinal tract was 17 rad during a threeyear period from 
196466 
the study is the first part of a fiveyear 15 million project 
that is the first major research into accidental and intentional 
release of large amounts of radioactive materials that drifted from 
hanford

a house subcommittee approved a bill thursday 
that would allow china to keep favoredtrade status this year but 
require significant progress in human rights if the designation is 
to be renewed 
rep donald pease dohio called his legislation an attempt to 
put china on notice that next year will be different if human 
rights practices dont improve 
the action by the ways and means trade subcommittee on a voice 
vote fell far short of the revocation of mostfavorednation trade 
status called for by the most strident congressional opponents of 
president bushs china policy those opponents believe a stronger 
response is needed in light of last years crushing of chinas 
prodemocracy movement 
but even the relatively mild move drew opposition from the 
administration which said it would harm us competitiveness and 
do more harm than good 
the united states and china have about 18 billion annually in 
bilateral trade 
with increasing signs of moderate pragmatic thinking in 
beijing we fear explicit public linkage of mostfavorednation 
trade status to human rights may harden chinas posture and make 
it more difficult to address our concerns deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger said in a letter to the subcommittee 
kent wiedemann director of the departments china desk noted 
beijings reported release of 881 political prisoners since the 
beginning of the year an estimated 435 political prisoners are 
still detained he said 
the subcommittee on a 53 vote rejected an effort by rep 
thomas downey dny to toughen the measure by requiring that the 
president certify that all human rights conditions set out in the 
bill have been fully met rather than simply certifying 
significant progress toward those goals 
on wednesday senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
introduced a bill that would revoke chinas favoredtrade status 
and the lower tariffs it provides within 90 days 
none of the moves is expected to win enough support on capitol 
hill to overcome an almost certain presidential veto

a flamboyant former president of a failed texas 
thrift has been charged with bank fraud in a 700 million real 
estate deal 
edwin t mcbirney iii who presided over tremendous growth of 
sunbelt savings association before its 2 billion failure was to 
surrender today to authorities 
mcbirneys attorney paul coggins said the indictment returned 
wednesday is a typical case of government overkill he said his 
client acted in sunbelts best interest 
mcbirney 37 appeared before us district judge barefoot 
sanders today to hear the charges against him and was released on 
his own recognizance coggins said mcbirney would plead innocent at 
a july 19 arraignment mcbirney would make no comment to reporters 
at the courthouse 
he was indicted on 17 counts including bank fraud 
misapplication of funds false entries and making false statements 
to regulators he faces up to 85 years in prison and a 42 million 
fine if convicted 
the indictment accuses mcbirney of hiding from regulators 
agreements with western savings association over partial financing 
of 700 million worth of property in southern california 
fbi agent pat dorsey said the deal contributed to the collapse 
of sunbelt in 1988 sunbelt savings was taken over by federal 
thrift regulators and merged with other insolvent thrifts 
the indictment was returned by one of three grand juries in 
dallas investigating bank and thrift fraud thirteen other sunbelt 
officials borrowers and accountants have been convicted as a 
result of a 2year investigation 
mcbirney acquired the dallasbased thrift in 1982 with five 
associates the thrift engaged in highrisk loans that were either 
unsecured or inadequately secured by commercial real estate and 
land according to government documents 
mcbirney was known in the thrift industry for flying friends to 
hawaii for fishing and las vegas for gambling he dressed as a king 
for a 1984 halloween party where guests dined on pheasant antelope 
and lion 
us attorney marvin collins of dallas has said complex bank 
fraud cases are difficult to prove unless we are able to put some 
money a lot of money in somebodys pocket 
the charges against mcbirney do not show who might have profited 
from the transactions he is accused of ensuring western savings a 
6 million profit on the sale of a property in return for western 
providing 30 million in financing on california property being 
bought by sun cal a sunbelt subsidiary 
the indictment marks another milestone in our crackdown on 
fraud in the thrift industry attorney general richard thornburgh 
said in washington

dr arnold relman said thursday he will retire in 
june after 14 years as editor of the new england journal of 
medicine the worlds leading chronicle of medical research 
relman 67 said he plans to write teach and lecture after he 
retires as editor in chief 
ive been thinking about it for some time and finally 
decided relman said its better to leave a little too soon 
than a little too late 
during relmans tenure the journals circulation grew by 
onethird and the weekly magazine established itself as a forum 
for exploring social and economic issues in medicine as well as 
being the leading showcase of research findings 
relman was frequently criticized for using the journal to 
question among other things the growing role of business in 
medical care 
relman has provided the strongest voice for professionalism 
and against business taking over medicine said dr george 
lundberg editor of the journal of the american medical association 
he has sought controversy in a responsible way he said 
he was very early in those areas and did engender great 
controversy and a lot of personal attacks he stood his ground and 
should have we are all in his debt for doing so 
the new england journal founded in 1812 was already one of the 
worlds leading medical publications when relman took over from dr 
franz ingelfinger in 1977 relman has continued to publish a large 
share of the worlds hottest medical research 
if you look worldwide the new england journal is clearly the 
leading journal of clinical medicine and has been for some time 
said david pendlebury editor of science watch published by the 
institute for scientific information in philadelphia 
many agree that relmans chief accomplishment has been taking 
the journal into the contentious area of medical finance and 
ethics the journal has explored and editorialized about such areas 
as the growth of profitmaking medicine and physicians financial 
conflict of interest 
relman said he plans to concentrate on these and related matters 
after he leaves the journal 
i want to spend the next few years as a more active 
participant in what i think will be a growing national discussion 
of health care he said i think the medical profession can 
make a major contribution toward solving the health care problems 
of this country if it will rouse itself i want to help in that 
process 
dr barry m manuel president of the massachusetts medical 
society which owns the journal said a search committee will be 
established soon to name a new top editor 
while relman has been editor the journals circulation has 
grown from 165000 to 225000 and it claims the largest paid 
circulation of any medical journal in the world 
before joining the new england journal relman taught at boston 
university and the university of pennsylvania and edited the 
journal of clinical investigation

texas officials said today that oileating 
microbes dumped on part of an oil slick from the wrecked 
supertanker mega borg appeared successful in eating the oil while 
not harming the environment 
if you believe your eyes it was a great success texas land 
commissioner garry mauro said at a news conference today test 
results from the small application show no evidence that the 
microbes produced any toxic byproducts and no evidence of change 
in the nutrient balance of the natural marine environment 
best of all the tests show that the microbes ate the oil 
mauro said adding that the surface oil in some samples was 
reduced to 30 percent of the original volume 
the process called bioremediation involves the use of 
microorganisms that are dumped on oil 
the naturally occurring bacteria reduce the oil to an emulsion 
of fatty acids this emulsion sinks and is consumed by marine life 
while the microbes die after the oil is gone 
the microbes were dropped on part of the slick from the mega 
borg which was left crippled in the gulf of mexico after an 
explosion june 8 an estimated 39 million gallons of angolan crude 
leaked from the vessel although much of that was consumed by fire 
the bioremediation tests on the spill cost the state 26000 
mauro and bj buck wynne chairman of the texas water 
commission said they were pleased with the results and were ready 
to push forward to have bioremediation included in companies oil

mouth cancer kills nearly 10000 people a year in 
the united states and unlike other cancers survival rates arent 
getting better federal health officials said thursday 
the atlantabased centers for disease control said oral and 
pharynx cancers killed 9742 americans in 1987 the latest year for 
which statistics are available that works out to 36 deaths per 
100000 people the same rate it was back in 1973 said cdc dental 
health specialist linda crossett 
and the survival rate hasnt changed in 16 years the cdc said 
only 52 percent of oral cancer patients survive five years or more 
thats in contrast to the survival rates for breast colorectal and 
prostate cancer which are improving 
federal health officials have set a national goal of cutting 
oral cancer deaths in middleage americans by 15 percent to 30 
percent by the year 2000 
were not making a lot of progress crossett said looking 
at new cases now about 30000 americans are diagnosed with oral 
cancers each year 
the survival rates are lower for blacks and getting worse 
just 31 percent of black patients survived oral cancer in 198186 
statistics compared with 35 percent in 197476 
for whites the survival rates have remained more constant 53 
percent in 198186 55 percent in 197476 
major risk factors for oral cancer include tobacco use either 
smoked or smokeless and drinking and the combined risks from 
tobacco and alcohol use appear to be substantially greater than 
those from tobacco or alcohol alone the cdc said in its weekly 
report 
the increased use of tobacco among women adolescents and 
children as compared to a decline in smoking overall is 
likely to elevate death rates for these cancers in the next several 
decades the report said 
in addition to continued use of tobacco the other major reason 
for oral cancer deaths is the fact that there has not been any 
improvement in early detection crossett said most are only 
detected after theyve grown pretty large so advanced that 
its obvious 
traditionally a dentist has been most likely to perform a 
thorough oral exam on a patient but the cdc noted a 1986 survey 
showing that people at highest risk for oral cancer sought the 
services of a standard physician four times more often than they 
went to the dentist 
and many people going to their physician may not get a 
thorough oral head and neck exam crossett said thats the 
big key early detection

east germanys major political factions said 
thursday they will fight to retain east germanys liberal abortion 
law when the nation unites with west germany 
also thursday the head of the west german central bank said 
east german factories must make radical changes to survive the 
increased competition that will come with reunification 
during an intense debate most of the political factions that 
control east germanys parliament spoke out in favor of retaining 
the abortion law in the territory of what is now east germany 
the german states are negotiating a final treaty that would 
result in the creation of a single germany by years end and the 
disparity in abortion laws is among the differences officials in 
each nation will be negotiating in the coming weeks 
some east german lawmakers expressed fear that their nation 
would become a lure for abortion tourists from west germany who 
head to the east for the operation 
the archconservative german social union was the only party of 
prime minister lothar de maizieres broad governing coalition that 
objected to retaining the law 
an abortion is always murder said lawmaker sabine landgraf 
of the german social union 
family minister christa schmidt told lawmakers the ministry has 
received more than 100000 letters from citizens asking that the 
abortion law be retained and 25317 demanding that it be revoked 
east german allows a female over age 14 to receive an abortion 
on demand during the first three months of pregnancy 
west germany allows abortions in the first three months only in 
cases of rape or incest if the mothers life is in danger if the 
fetus is expected to be severely handicapped or if the womans 
financial situation would make it impossible for her to raise a 
child 
there were 75297 abortions performed in west germany last year 
a nation of 60 million people and 73000 abortions in east 
germany which has 16 million people 
also thursday bundesbank president karl otto poehl told 
reporters following a central bank council meeting that was held in 
the former headquarters of the communist party central committee 
that west german taxpayers are unlikely to support unprofitable 
east german factories for long 
following the july 1 economic merger the bank began controlling 
the money supply of both german states 
east german companies have to earn their marks he said 
after the banks board held its first meeting in east berlin 
east german factories have recently cut payrolls and forming 
joint ventures with western firms in an effort to survive 
but an east german official said many of the nations factories 
are firing foreign workers first as they slash employee payrolls to 
compete with western busineses 
i am ashamed of that said horst kinitz head of the state 
employment agency he called such layoffs illegal because they are 
discriminatory 
an estimated 80000 mozambicans cubans and vietnamese are 
working in east german enterprises under contracts with those 
countries made by the former communist government 
the government is trying to blunt the effects of unemployment by 
encouraging enterprises to reduce worker hours to keep more people 
on payrolls 
about 222000 employees in the nation of 8 million workers are 
on such shortened hours now and another 240000 will be added soon 
kinitz said 
an estimated 162000 east germans are unemployed 
poehl said east germans have been frugal with their marks and 
have withdrawn about half of the 25 billion marks made available to 
them 
there is no reason to fear that monetary union will lead to 
unacceptably high inflation levels poehl said

two reputed red army faction terrorists were 
handed over to west german authorities thursday prosecutors said 
after years of sanctuary that may have been provided by east 
germanys nowdisbanded secret police 
inge viett and werner lotze arrived in the west german city of 
karlsruhe where they will appear before an investigating 
magistrate according to rolf hannich a spokesman for the west 
german prosecutors office 
they were among nine alleged red army faction members arrested 
in east germany in a series of raids last month one alleged 
terrorist was released because the arrest warrant against her had 
expired 
the arrests caused an uproar in both germanys after one of those 
seized said she had been given sanctuary and a new identity by the 
old east german secret police force known as the stasi 
news reports in west germany have also alleged that deposed 
communist party chief erich honecker and stasi boss erich mielke 
were personally responsible for hiding the purported terrorists 
in east berlin prosecution spokesman dieter plath said ms 
viett had been extradited against her will and in defiance of 
an article in the east german constitution that bans the 
extradition of criminal suspects to a foreign power 
plath said prosecutors had acted on the assumption that the 
article no longer applied to west germany after the two germanys 
unified in effect with the july 1 merger of their economies and 
social welfare systems 
an east berlin court confirmed that reading of the law plath 
added 
ms viett is suspected of the attempted murder of a paris 
policeman who stopped her during a routine check in 1981 
lotze has said he wanted to cooperate with west german 
prosecutors in order to possibly qualify for a program that offers 
lenient punishment for former terrorists willing to testify against 
their organization 
lotze who has said he made a deliberate decision to quit 
the red army faction and move to east germany in 1979 is suspected 
of involvement in the 1977 kidnapping and shooting death of 
hansmartin schleyer chairman of west germanys biggest employers 
group 
west germany has warrants out for the arrest of both suspects 
for their alleged red army faction membership 
they are the second and third terrorist suspects to arrive in 
west germany on july 5 susanne albrecht another red army faction 
suspect was handed to west german authorities after saying she 
wanted to testify for the prosecution 
plath would not confirm recent reports that another of the 
suspects silke maierwitt had also asked to be sent to west 
germany 
west german authorities have said they werent planning to seek 
formal extradition in any of the cases because west german law will 
come into force in east germany after the two nations formally 
unite most likely in december 
the red army faction waged a terrorist campaign against west 
german capitalism and nato in the 1970s and 1980s

north carolina could become the second 
state to scrap the winnertakeall method of allocating electoral 
votes in presidential elections 
a bill that would divide the states 13 electoral votes by 
congressional districts was up for a state senate vote today after 
passage by the house last year but the vote was delayed until 
friday or next week because a cost analysis hadnt been completed 
said sen tom taft chairman of the senate election laws committee 
the democratcontrolled state legislature is expected to redraw 
congressional district lines in 1992 republicans fear the new 
system would leave democrats with control of all 13 electoral votes 
currently whichever candidate garners a majority in a state 
wins all the states electoral votes 
maine adopted the alternative method in 1969 but it has made no 
difference in the way the states electoral vote has been 
allocated a similar proposal passed the connecticut house this 
session but died in the senate after the governor hinted he would 
veto it 
in north carolina where republican gov jim martin has no veto 
power the senate was on its way to approving the bill wednesday 
when republican lt gov jim gardner ruled the measure must be 
accompanied by a fiscal note showing how much its passage might 
cost the state 
republicans acknowledged the move was a delay tactic 
under the bill candidates would receive one electoral vote for 
each of the 11 congressional districts they win north carolinas 
two remaining electoral votes would go to the candidate who carried 
the state 
jack hawke state gop chairman told reporters republicans would 
lose if the bill becomes law 
frankly i believe we should be more interested in a fair 
system than in one that can be rigged in favor of a particular 
party that happens to control the redistricting process hawke 
said 
taft denied partisan motivation behind the bill calling it

armand hammer chairman of occidental 
petroleum corp is being sued for 700 million by the heir to the 
estate of his wife claiming at least a half interest in hammers 
art collection 
the lawsuit filed wednesday in state court alleges fraud 
legal malpractice and financial misconduct it contends hammer and 
a law firm representing the industrialist repeatedly deceived 
frances hammer about her ownership rights to hammers assets 
the lawsuit was filed by robert weiss of los angeles husband of 
joan weiss mrs weiss a niece of frances hammer is the sole heir 
to mrs hammers estate mrs hammer died in december after 33 
years of marriage to armand hammer and named robert weiss executor 
of her will 
the 92yearold hammer maintains that his wife signed documents 
waiving her interest in his art collection which has been 
estimated to be worth 450 million 
richard c cleary a lawyer for the weisses said those were 
part of the pattern of fraud and deceit the suit also says mrs

ridleys constituency association in cirencester and tewkesbury 
prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of commons on 
thursday that ridleys remarks did not reflect government policy 
or her own views but she rejected demands for his dismissal 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock said mrs thatcher 
should recognize the interview is not just deeply offensive to 
our allies and partners but deeply damaging to our countrys 
interests and he must go 
but channel 4 news reported that a straw poll of 52 of the 372 
conservatives in the house of commons found that 22 shared ridleys 
fears of german domination of europe 
conservative lawmaker james hill said it was timely to warn west 
germany that we cannot stand by and aid them to take over 
central europe 
ridley 61 the chainsmoking younger son of viscount ridley 
has survived many previous controversies because of his close 
relationship with mrs thatcher 
im a great nick ridley fan the prime minister said last 
year 
in the spectator interview ridley said the west german 
governments support for european monetary union is all a german 
racket designed to take over the whole of europe it has to be 
thwarted 
this rushed takeover by the germans on the worst possible 
basis with the french behaving like poodles to the germans is 
absolutely intolerable ridley said 
he also condemned the breathtaking arrogance of the 
12nation european community which he said was run by 17 
unelected reject politicians 
im not against giving up sovereignty in principle but not to 
this lot you might just as well give it to adolf hitler 
frankly he said 
spectator editor dominic lawson who conducted the interview 
suggested that west german chancellor helmut kohl was not going 
to bomb us after all 
ridley replied im not sure i wouldnt rather have er 
the shelters and the chance to fight back than simply being taken 
over by economics 
britain must play its historic role as the balance of power in 
europe ridley said never has it been more necessary than now 
with germany so uppity 
the spectators cover had a cartoon of ridley painting a hitler 
mustache on kohls portrait 
mrs thatcher who returned thursday from a summit meeting with 
kohl and other leaders of major industrial nations told the house 
of commons that ridleys apology should be the end of the matter 
in bonn kohls aide lutz stavenhagen condemned ridleys attack 
as scandalous 
otto graf lambsdorff chairman of the free democrats kohls 
coalition partners said either he was drunk or he had not 
yet gotten over the soccer loss of the english team against the 
germans in the world cup semifinals 
tim helm a member of the european movement which promotes 
continental harmony said ridleys remarks reflected a section of 
opinion which is present across europe not just in this country 
helm who is of germanenglish parentage said it was fitting 
that the issue erupted while ridley was on a visit to hungary 
because clearly a number of eastern european countries are 
frightened of what they see as a fortress europe with an 
overpowerful germany but all those fears are based on lack of 
knowledge 
lawson said he thought ridley was expressing the views of many 
ordinary people in the way that politicians dont

former attorney general edwin meese iii was 
awarded 460509 thursday for legal expenses he incurred during a 
special prosecutors criminal investigation 
independent counsel james mckay declined to prosecute meese at 
the conclusion of the investigation which was expanded several 
times to include a variety of conflictofinterest allegations 
against the attorney general 
the independent counsel division of the us circuit court of 
appeals ruled that the government should pay 460509 of the 
575598 in legal fees and costs claimed by meeses defense 
lawyers nathan lewin and james rocap 
among the 115000 worth of expenses the court disallowed was a 
claim of 16652 by meeses lawyers for time spent talking to 
reporters about the case 
under the independent counsel law meese is entitled to 
government reimbursement for reasonable legal fees because he was 
not indicted as a result of the 14month investigation 
among other things meese was investigated for possible ethics 
law violations for intervening to help wedtech corp obtain a 
lucrative defense contract at a time when his longtime friend e 
bob wallach was a consultant for the company 
wallach has been convicted of racketeering in connection with 
his wedtech dealings 
mckay found that meese who was counselor to president reagan 
when wedtech won the contract did not personally benefit from the 
deal and therefore did not violate conflictofinterest laws 
the independent counsel also investigated meeses failure to 
divest himself of 14000 worth of stock in regional bell system 
operating companies when he was formulating justice department 
policy about the breakup of american telephone amp telegraph 
mckays investigation found probable violations of 
conflictofinterest and tax laws but declined to prosecute saying 
there was no evidence meese was motivated by personal gain or 
selfinterest 
meese left office about a month after mckay issued his july 5 
1988 report 
the court also refused to reimburse meese for 6335 for legal 
bills after the filing of a response to mckays report of the 
investigation and for 5170 he was billed to prepare to testify at 
the trial of former white house aide lyn nofziger 
a federal appellate court last year overturned nofzigers 
ethicslaw conviction for lobbying former reagan administration 
colleagues including meese on behalf of wedtech a labor union 
and another defense contractor 
the court also disallowed 11311 worth of staff overtime 
10000 for photocopying it found excessive and 51167 for costs 
it said were not adequately documented by the lawyers

the discovery of a gene causing elephant 
mans disease is the latest in a series of such findings for 
various illnesses 
scientists pursue these genes in the hopes of improving 
treatment and in some cases aiding detection of people who can 
unknowingly pass the faulty genes to their offspring 
last august scientists from the united states and canada 
announced they had found the gene that causes cystic fibrosis a 
devastating killer of young people that affects some 30000 
americans 
in 1986 scientists found the gene that causes the most common 
and serious kind of muscular dystrophy the duchenne form in 
followup analysis announced the following year researchers 
identified the protein produced by the normal version of the gene 
that revealed that duchenne is caused by the lack of this 
protein giving clues for developing a treatment 
other recent studies have found that cancers of the breast lung 
and colon can appear if particular cancersuppressing genes are 
absent or malfunctioning

children are in the radio and tv audience 24 
hours a day the federal communications commission said thursday in 
reiterating that it wants a total ban on indecent broadcast 
programming to protect youngsters under 18 
the commission voted 50 to report its conclusions to the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia which is considering 
a 24hour ban the fcc imposed under orders from congress in 1988 
the court last year told the commission not to enforce the 
24hour ban pending further review but said the commission could 
develop evidence supporting its position 
the fcc report could play a major role in how the appeals court 
and inevitably the supreme court decides the issue 
in essence the fcc is now enforcing the regulations that were 
in effect before congress told the commission two years ago to ban 
indecent programming roundtheclock 
the current regulations ban obscene material at all times and 
indecent material from about 6 am to 8 pm local time the fcc 
defines indecent as language or material that depicts or 
describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory 
activities or organs 
neither the current regulation nor a 24hour ban would affect 
cable television programming 
the fcc in its report said a 24hour indecency ban would 
promote a compelling government interest and would be 
narrowly tailored to serve that interest without infringing on 
broadcasters first amendment rights 
the fcc said it was guided in its conclusion by a 1989 supreme 
court ruling that used the compelling interestnarrowly 
tailored argument in deciding that the government had the right 
to regulate indecent telephone transmissions 
broadcasters and freespeech advocates who had asked the 
appeals court to prevent the fcc from implementing the 
roundtheclock ban attacked the commissions new report 
its clear that congress doesnt want broadcasters to be able 
to operate within limits guaranteed by the first amendment and 
sadly the fcc is enthusiastically cooperating said andrew j 
schwartzman an attorney for people for the american way one of 
the groups challenging the 24hour ban 
what adults should be able to hear or see should not be 
determined by what childrens needs are schwartzman added 
i think its preposterous said peggy charren of the 
bostonbased action for childrens television the main plaintiff 
in the court challenge protecting children from indecency should 
not be the role of the fcc that should be the role of parents 
edward o fritts president of the national association of 
broadcasters said the nab was disappointed with the fccs 
action the courts have made it clear that a 24hour ban on 
constitutionally protected speech is contrary to the first 
amendment fritts said 
under new chairman alfred sikes the fcc has put the nations 
radio stations on notice over the last year that it will not 
tolerate the broadcast of indecent programs before 8 pm the 
commission has fined several stations already for broadcasting 
sexually explicit material 
fcc officials thursday said the commission had received 88000 
letters complaining of indecent programming mostly on radio 
weve received a huge amount of mail and it seems the 
public strongly supports the action were taking today sikes 
said 
at thursdays meeting commissioner ervin s duggan read from a 
letter from a mother who said it would take a superhuman effort 
for parents to monitor what their children hear on see on radio and 
tv at all times 
fcc officials repeatedly refused to speculate on what types of 
tv programs could be considered indecent

homeless advocate mitch snyder faced irs 
demands for about 90000 at the time of his apparent suicide last 
week but was looking forward to turning the issue into a forum on 
national priorities friends said thursday 
we had just gotten the bill a few weeks ago carol fennelly 
snyders longtime companion said they have been investigating us 
for two years and we had been waiting for a decision 
the internal revenue service sent the 46yearold snyder a 
preliminary notice dated june 17 demanding 50000 in back taxes 
plus 40000 in penalties to cover 150000 he received in 1985 and 
1986 from television producers for the rights to his story 
fennelly said 
we refused to respond to their silliness fennelly said 
obviously he did not have that kind of money and if he did he 
wouldnt give it to them 
he saw it as an opportunity to have a forum to address 
national priorities fennelly said mitch used everything as a 
forum 
snyder was found hanged last thursday at a homeless shelter he 
helped found in northwest washington police said he apparently 
committed suicide 
attorney jerry kafka who was handling the case for snyder 
described the irs action as a runofthemill audit in its 
beginning stages irs officials have declined to comment 
fennelly said the federal inquiry came after she provided 
financial documents relating to the management of the community for 
creative nonviolence which runs snyders shelter 
snyder had maintained he contributed all his earnings to the 
group which operated on a budget of 570000 last year 
fennelly said snyder never handled checks for the organization 
mitch didnt even sign the check fennelly said someone 
always signed them for him it has always been a joke around here 
will the real mitch snyder signature please stand up 
fennelly said snyder relished the thought of going to trial 
against the irs 
kafka said if mitch has any taxable estate they the irs 
could pursue that but my understanding is that he has none

the house appropriations committee on thursday 
approved a 170 billion spending bill for federal health labor and 
education programs next year 4 billion more than president bush 
requested 
the appropriations bill continues provisions from past years 
prohibiting spending federal medicaid money for abortions for poor 
women except in cases where the life of the mother is in danger 
abortionrights supporters succeeded in adding language to a 
similar bill last year that expanded that exception to include 
medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest but bush vetoed 
the bill because of the broadened abortion provisions and the 
house failed to override his veto 
because of parliamentary roadblocks abortion rights lawmakers 
said they probably would not attempt to add abortion provisions 
when the spending bill goes to the house floor probably next 
thursday 
however they said they expected the senate to add a similar 
amendment when it debates the spending bill triggering a repeat of 
the 1989 fights when the bill returns to the house for concurrence 
the bill provides 76 billion for the department of labor in 
fiscal 1991 it authorizes 1357 billion for the department of 
health and human services 26 billion for the department of 
education and 1 billion for related agencies 
the total represents a 173 billion increase over 1990 spending 
and a 42 billion increase over the amount requested by bush in 
his proposed 1991 budget 
rep william natcher dky chairman of the appropriations 
subcommittee that wrote the bill said it included money set aside 
for major child care and aids prevention bills that are nearing 
passage 
nearly threequarters of the bills money goes to mandatory 
entitlement programs such as medicare medicaid welfare and other 
programs in which spending is required by previously passed law 
it includes 439 billion in discretionary programs an increase 
of 56 billion over comparable amounts in 1990 spending and 32 
billion more than requested by bush

a violent sandinista strike that 
threatened to topple president violeta barrios de chamorro ended 
early thursday with her government agreeing to more major 
concessions as a price of survival 
the strike accord dilutes mrs chamorros power to trim a 
bloated public payroll and to reverse what her economic advisers 
see as a crippling legacy of more than a decade of leftist 
sandinista rule 
public employees won an immediate 43 percent raise with another 
unspecified raise to come next month 
it was the second major wage concession for nicaraguas 65000 
government employees who got a 100 percent raise after a may 
walkout in addition to government workers thousands of employees 
of staterun industries also stayed off the job inthe latest strike 
in addition the government agreed not to carry out its threat 
to fire those taking part in what it had declared an illegal 
walkout and to pay compensation to 800 people fired since mrs 
chamorros april 25 inauguration 
the strikers also forced the conservative government to back 
down on a key part of its plan to return nicaragua to a freemarket 
economy the return of lands confiscated in the 1979 revolution 
but the price of survival was high and the support the army and 
police gave mrs chamorro appeared limited both were party organs 
under the sandinistas 
mrs chamorro said late wednesday she wouldnt negotiate until 
the strikers met certain conditions but secret talks began within 
hours and the accord with the sandinistaled national workers front 
was announced early thursday 
the president had said a dialogue could begin only after the 
streets were clear of the barricades that had paralyzed the capital 
since sunday strikers vacated occupied government installations 
and basic public services were restored 
although the violence that claimed at least six lives had ended 
the capital was still a maze of paving stone barricades or their 
debris when talks began and many buildings were still in the hands 
of strikers 
managua began returning to normal thursday although its pocked 
and scarred streets were still a motorists nightmare taxis were 
circulating businesses were reopening and the union had told 
strikers to go back to work the only concession the strikers made 
both sides were declaring victory in a confrontation the united 
states and president chamorro had called an attempt to destablize 
her government 
despite her concessions mrs chamorro portrayed her government 
as a winner it had not fallen and she and her advisers called the 
armys decision not to back the strikers a triumph 
army and police bulldozers had removed barricades but most 
blockades were rebuilt without interference and there were no 
arrests 
in addition to putting the brakes on returning confiscated land 
to prerevolutionary owners the agreement opens the door to 
powersharing with workers in key industries such as textiles 
construction and transportation 
the sandinistas had vowed to govern from below after mrs 
chamorro and her coalition won the feb 25 general elections 
the sandinista party newspaper barricada said thursday the 
sandinistas were making good on that promise 
victory for the strikers a banner headline proclaimed over 
news of mrs chamorros promise to negotiate a nationwide social 
accord with workers and businessmen on economic reforms 
other concessions include a promise to establish a new national 
minimum wage in september payable in a new currency that will 
trade on a par with the dollar 
the nicaraguan cordoba has been devalued more than 20 times 
since mrs chamorro inherited a bankrupt government and now goes 
for about 450000 to the dollar on the black market 
francisco mayorga the head of the central bank and the 
architect of the governments economic program said he hoped the 
strike had reaffirmed the possibility of cooperation 
we could have arrived at the same outcome without a strike 
without a confrontation without a crisis he said on radio

the chairman of a senate panel said thursday 
the air force had spent 73 million on 173 facsimile machines that 
are made to withstand a nuclear blast but are technologically 
outdated 
sen carl levin dmich questioned that spending as well as 
the services decision to buy nearly 40 million worth of spare 
parts for the machines added equipment that should last 20 years 
the air force fax machines are a textbook example of how the 
system should not work levin who chairs the senate governmental 
affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management said in 
a speech on the senate floor 
the air force had no immediate comment on his allegations 
the senate committee found that the air force developed 
specifications for the fax machines in 1982 but due to design and 
production problems did not make a final production decision until 
april 1989 levin said 
by that time commercial fax technology had evolved so much 
that the original specification which may have been at the 
cutting edge of technology in the early 1980s was outdated even 
before the machines were built the senator said 
the navy has decided to buy an offtheshelf machine with a 
higher resolution that the air forces fax and at a significantly 
lower cost of about 50000 each 
the army has purchased a commercial machine modified to meet its 
specifications without defense department funds the army machine 
costs about 16000 each levin said 
the navy and army originally had been involved with the air 
force in the plan to buy special fax machines 
criticism of the air force fax machines arose in november 1989 
after a published report said the equipment cost the service 
421000 apiece a figure derived by dividing the 73 million cost 
by 173 
an air force spokesman maj lou figueroa disputed the total 
saying the service was paying 76000 for each unit 
he said that the machines were being purchased from litton 
industries under a contract for 33 million and that an additional 
contract for some 40 million covers a very extensive list of 
diagnostic equipment laser assemblies and paper which costs 100 
a roll 
the machines are designed to withstand the rigors of the 
battlefield and to be used under a variety of conditions that might 
be encountered in wartime figueroa said 
the machines must withstand a nuclear explosion be able to 
operate after being immersed in three feet of water and function in 
temperatures ranging from 25 to 125 degrees fahrenheit levin said

boris n yeltsin once persuaded his entire 
fifthgrade class to jump out the window on thursday 50 years 
later he threw down a similar challenge to 18 million soviet 
communists 
i have to obey the will of the people yeltsin told nearly 
4700 communists at a kremlin congress as he began what could 
become an exodus of radical reformers and angry workers from the 
ruling party 
in quitting yeltsin cited his duties as the newly elected 
president of the russian federation the largest soviet republic 
which he has pledged to free of the diktat of central communist 
and government rule 
the mostly hardline delegates who sat in stoney silence as 
yeltsin approached the podium to deliver his suprise announcement 
shouted shame and whistled in derision as he strode out of the 
kremlin palace of congresses 
mikhail s gorbachev who holds the top jobs in the central 
government and party watched impassively as yeltsin rose to 
challenge him for control of the reform movement 
leaving the party does not mean leaving the kremlin for yeltsin 
who in may was elected chairman or president of the russian supreme 
soviet the legislature that meets regularly in the great kremlin 
palace 
last month yeltsin persuaded the russian legislature to pass a 
resolution on sovereignty declaring its intention to remain within 
the soviet union but take over much of the decisionmaking power of 
central authorities 
yeltsin gambled and lost before at a closed communist party 
meeting in late 1987 when he criticized the slow pace of reforms 
as a result he lost his job as party leader in moscow and was 
bounced from his nonvoting membership in the communist party 
politburo 
the 59yearold siberian with a shock of silver hair and a 
booming voice fought his way back to the top winning election to 
the national parliament last year then gaining the newly created 
russian presidency six weeks ago 
yeltsins spectacular departure from the party seemed likely to 
transform the defections from the party from a trickle into a river 
coal miners throughout the nation staged a oneday strike on 
wednesday urging workers to quit the party and members of the 
radical reformist democratic platform also announced their intent 
to leave 
it was not clear how many of the communist partys 18 million 
members would exit but a sizeable movement seemded likely to rally 
around yeltsin who has described himself as a lifelong maverick 
i was the ringleader always devising some mischief he 
wrote in his recent autobiography against the grain 
his aspirations to leadership are based on a long history of 
persuading others to join in sometimes mischievous adventures 
as a schoolboy in the ural mountains where european russia 
turns into siberia yeltsin persuaded his entire fifthgrade class 
to jump out the window when their unpopular teacher left the room 
the room was on the first floor yeltsin persuaded the headmaster 
to forgive the class and all ended well 
but yeltsins mischievous side has provided his opponents with 
ample material to embarrass him and deepened the conviction among 
some soviets that yeltsin is not always in control of himself a 
potentially dangerous quality in a national leader 
last year pravda a publication of the soviet communist party 
ran a report accusing him of drinking heavily during a trip to the 
united states especially before a speech in baltimore 
yeltsin claimed he was under the influence of jet lag not 
bourbon but the mud stuck 
in another widely publicized incident he insinuated that 
government agents pushed him off a bridge into a river near moscow 
yeltsin acknowledges that he has undergone a transformation 
from an oldstyle party boss into a firebrand populist a change he 
says reflects the changes sweeping the country as a whole 
before gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 yeltsin was the 
party leader in sverdlovsk in the urals a virtual dictator over 
one of the most important centers of the soviet defense industry 
in a speech friday at the 28th communist party congress yeltsin 
warned delegates that if they did not change their attitude they 
could go the way of dictators swept from power last fall in other 
socialist countries 
if you think there is a different possibility look at the 
fate of the communist parties of eastern europe yeltsin said 
those parties he said separated themselves from the people 
didnt understand their role and were left on the side of the 
road 
gorbachev had sought to avoid the split in the party by 
accelerating the reforms under his guidance the party last winter 
relinquished its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power 
so far no nationwide political organization has emerged to 
challenge the party but that could change quickly 
leading members of the radical reformist democratic platform 
who balked at fulfilling their pledge to quit the party announced 
shortly after yeltsin that they too were quitting the party 
yeltsin has said he will use his government post to divest the 
communists of their wealth 
it is an illusion to think that after all dissenters all who 
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus quit the 
party it will retain all the property of the soviet communist 
party and the associated authority he said friday as president 
of russia he is in a strong position to strip the party of much of 
that wealth

the american civil liberties union said 
thursday that it wants the justice department to drop a request for 
information from a group lobbying to suspend military aid to el 
salvador 
the justice department last month asked the national agenda for 
peace in el salvador to describe the nature of its activities for 
or in the interests of the rebel fmln and whether its activities 
were financed or directed by a foreign organization 
the federal law requiring registration of foreign agents does 
not give the department the right to ask those questions aclu 
official morton halperin said at a news conference 
national agenda was formed at the 1988 democratic national 
convention by a group of delegates seeking to bring visibility to 
the issue of us military aid to el salvador 
geoffrey thale head of the threeperson national agenda staff 
based here said the group did not receive money from anyone in el 
salvador 
our view clearly is that were not foreign agents thale 
said 
the farabundo marti national liberation front known as the fmln 
after its initials in spanish is the principal opponent of the el 
salvador government in the decadeold civil war 
the justice department said a may newspaper advertisement by the 
group indicates that you are engaged in publicity activities on 
behalf of the fmln 
the ad called on congress to withdraw military aid to el 
salvador as a way to force a political solution to the war and to 
force action against those responsible for the murders of six 
jesuit priests and their housekeeper and her daughter last year 
reps robert w kastenmeier dwis and don edwards dcalif 
said in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh that there 
were nothing in the ad to indicate that the group is engaged in 
activities on behalf of any foreign principal 
the letter from kastenmeier and edwards released by the aclu 
asked thornburgh for information about the inquiry 
doug tillett a spokesman for the justice department described 
the request as fairly routine and said he didnt believe the 
department would withdraw it 
it sounds to me like an overreaction on their part he said

defense secretary dick cheney has canceled 
plans to test chemical weapons as a result of the recent 
ussoviet agreement to destroy the deadly armaments in the 
future a pentagon spokesman said thursday 
all of these decisions are in keeping with our intent to get 
ready for the bilateral destruction agreement with the soviet 
union spokesman pete williams said 
the agreement signed june 1 by president bush and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev must still be ratified by the 
legislatures of the two countries expected next year 
but cheney is making decisions in preparation for the agreement 
williams said the defense chief has made cuts in the 1991 budget 
being debated in congress 
specifically williams said cheney has 
eliminated money for production of the bigeye bomb and canceled 
testing for the navys technically troubled program that has been 
scheduled for this fall 
decided not to ask for production money for the armys 
155millimeter artillery shell 
opted to end testing of the armys multiple launch rocket 
system after technical aspects are checked out 
once we get a good set of data on how that works we will stop 
the program and there will be no production funds requested for 
that simply research and development funds to finish that 
analysis and testing program said williams 
while plans are under way to scrap chemical weapons williams 
said some will remain in the arsenal simply to maintain a small 
part of our deterrent capability because we believe that is a 
prudent thing to do insofar as chemical weapons are concerned he 
said 
in money terms cheney is eliminating 667 million from the 
bigeye bomber 743 million from the artillery shell program and 
278 million from the mlrs program 
but williams said money will be needed after when the chemical 
weapons programs are killed because it takes some money to cancel 
a contract you cant just call up a contractor and say im 
sorry never mind 
williams said the defense department will continue to buy a 
chemicals used in the binary weapons weapons that use two 
harmless chemicals that are dangerous only when combined in order 
to finish testing at a plant in pine bluff ark 
officials want to make sure they can produce binary weapons in 
case the united states should need it should something go wrong 
with the treaty 
on a related matter williams said us officials have 
temporarily stopped verification tests at the johnston atoll 
chemical agent disposal system about 700 miles southwest of hawaii 
they want to take stock of what has happened so far 
williams said adding there were some positive monitor readings 
after a chemical weapons test 
officials want to make sure the monitors are working properly 
he said tests are expected to resume at the end of the week

viewers who grumble that the only news on tv is 
bad news soon will be able to choose some of the stories they want 
to see on cable news network 
cnn announced thursday the first experiment in interactive 
news by a national network a program similar to ones by smaller 
stations where viewers vote on whether to see godzilla or 
planet of the apes as the latenight movie 
the experiment begins july 23 on cnns newsnight an 
hourlong newscast at midnight the choices will involve secondary 
news or features 
viewers will see a summary of headlines at the beginning of the 
show and as anchors read the days top news dial a 900 telephone 
number to vote on which of the stories theyd like to see the 
stories that get the most votes which cost 95 cents per call will 
be shown 
cnn officials emphasize that viewers wont be dictating news 
value but will tell the network what areas outside of breaking 
news most interest them 
were not going to let viewers decide the editorial policy of 
cnn said spokesman john bianchi a lot of stuff does not make 
it on the air that we do in fact cover this is a way to get more 
of the stuff on the air that we might not have made the decision on 
initially 
bianchi said cnn which had trouble filling all its newscasts 
when it was started by media mogul ted turner in 1980 just doesnt 
have enough time now to air all the stories it would like to so 
viewers in 54 million us households and 90 countries are 
being asked to let producers know their preferences 
we can tell by the volume and quality of viewer phone calls 
and letters we receive each day that cnn has very informed 
viewers said cnn senior executive bob furnad this new 
interactive segment will allow those viewers to tell us in a 
relatively direct fashion the kinds of information they most want 
at least one of cnns network competitors reacted with surprise 
to the announcement asked if the concept would spread to the big 
three networks cbs spokesman tom goodman said it doesnt sound 
like something wed get involved in 
the public relations departments at nbc and abc offered no 
immediate response 
interactive television a concept of twoway communication 
between viewers and programmers with tv remote controls emerged in 
the early 1980s 
cnns concept is not exactly the promise of interactivity 
where you can really customize your tv viewing on what you want to 
see said media analyst betsy frank with saatchi amp saatchi in new 
york but using 900line technology to a certain degree and 
having people feel they have a decisionmaking posture in what gets 
aired its an interesting idea 
ms frank said the phonein concept is not new networks like 
fox have used it for viewers to vote on movie lineups 
the trend of the last decade is viewers assuming more control 
and taking it away from the three networks she said adding that 
cnn could raise its ratings with the experiment the more 
involved the viewer the more likely he is to hang around 
warner amex cable communications inc developed the first 
interactive technology called qube in ohio in 1981 in one 
experiment cable subscribers electronically registered their 
reactions to a speech by thenpresident carter by responding to 
questions on remote booksized consoles hooked to their 
televisions 
actv domestic corp then developed technology tested in a 
eightweek experiment on continental cablevision in massachusetts 
in which viewers of a golf tournament chose which player they 
wanted to see the camera followed that player through the course

a bit of americana slipped into history 
thursday when the nations last known operating handcranked 
partyline telephone system was disconnected replaced by 
privateline touchtone technology 
now that i know its working im going to call my mother back 
in iowa said joyce rinehart at the ramshead motel and 
restaurant this is the first time ive talked on a phone like 
this in a long time where i could hear and not have to shout 
im not screaming anymore said garry pedrow as he answered 
the first incoming call on the new system at his shoup country 
store near north fork in central idahos rugged salmon river 
canyon its sure nice 
the depressionera singleline ringdown system a fixture of 
rural america in decades past had been the link to the rest of the 
world for the 18 yearround canyon residents 
parties on the line could crank the magneto to ring others along 
the line or the central office for a connection to town numbers and 
longdistance each customer had a coded ring and supposedly 
answered just that ring while ignoring the rest 
operator steve freestone handled the last outgoing call from the 
old system at the switchboard of his motel deluxe in salmon 20 
miles away and then announced the old line was dead 
a half hour later state public utilities commission president 
joe miller placed the first call on the new system to gary byrne 
head of the rural electrification administration which underwrote 
the 350000 modernization 
were moving into our second century said miller referring 
to idahos centennial on july 3 its time for as much of our 
state as possible to be connected to the rest of the world in a 
meaningful way 
the demise of the battery and magneto system was set a year ago 
when atampt said computerization would require the elimination of the 
local operator 
freestone and the operators preceding him connected calls from 
canyon customers to the proper numbers outside and routed incoming 
calls to the right phone using a series of coded rings the shoup 
country store was three longs 
atampt us west and century telephone co in salmon agreed to keep 
the operator in place until installation of the new system 
residents along the wilderness river had mixed feelings about 
losing a system they felt fit in well with a lifestyle that 
includes only seasonal running water and requires private 
generators for electricity 
its historic but when youre in business you need a town 
phone system said rinehart at the ramshead motel and restaurant 
about 30 miles down the canyon 
the crank system was originally set up by the us forest 
service in 1931 it was bought by the resident cooperative called 
the north fork telephone corp for a dollar in 1952 when the 
government switched to radio communications the years had taken 
their toll 
its a raggedy old thing freestone said theyve got it 
nailed to trees and mountains most of the time you have to yell 
pretty loud to talk to people down river 
in their heyday the wallmounted units with a black metal 
mouthpiece on an arm and a receiver hung on a twoprong hook on the 
left side were the communications heart of as many as 125 million 
american farms and ranches 
party line chatter with two or three parties talking and 
several more secretly listening was a popular rural recreation 
long before electricity television and even radio 
pedrow said the canyon residents are keeping a few of the hand 
crank phones hooked together for the historic value an idea 
wholeheartedly endorsed by rinehart 
id just like to keep them around to show the younger 
generation what we had to use she said on this old system 
ive talked to the marshall islands ive talked to canada ive 
talked to hawaii so that old line did reach out

us consumers are paying as much as 1 
billion too much annually for international telephone calls the 
federal communications commission said thursday in proposing to 
make it easier for us carriers to negotiate lower rates with 
overseas phone companies 
the commission said us phone companies in 1988 paid 2 billion 
more to foreign usually governmentoperated phone companies 
than they collected from foreign carriers for international calls 
about half that amount represented an overpayment by us 
consumers to foreign carriers the fcc said 
intense competition among us phone companies since the 1984 
breakup of the bell system has pushed prices down for international 
calls but has resulted in foreign companies gaining a larger share 
of the charges for such calls fcc chairman alfred sikes said 
before the commissions 50 vote 
competition and technological progress in telecommunications 
has revealed a cartellike pricing and profitsharing 
arrangement sikes said us subscribers and those in a 
handful of other countries are both the winners and losers 
companies such as atampt negotiate accounting rates that 
determine how atampt and a foreign company will divide the charges 
consumers pay for international calls under present formulas 
about 75 cents of every dollar collected by us carriers for 
international calls goes to foreign carriers 
atampt contends foreign governments are charging far above the 
actual cost of service and that because more calls flow from the 
united states to other countries than in the reverse direction 
having accounting rates that exceed costs results in a significant 
outflow of us dollars to other nations 
some overseas phone carriers use the funds to finance local 
service and say it is vital to their economies 
atampt argues that what foreign entities will lose in lower 
accounting rates they will more than make up in the increased 
volume of calling resulting from lower prices 
the fcc proposed to allow us companies to negotiate lower 
accounting rates more quickly the commission also proposed to 
lower the accounting rates itself if it finds that costs are too 
high 
atampt welcomed the commissions proposal 
company spokesman herb linnen said the proposal sets up the 
possibility of lowering accounting rates for all of the us 
carriers and that can translate into savings for consumers

wheat farmers are harvesting a bumper crop 
estimated at 27 billion bushels up 33 percent from last year and 
the biggest output in six years the agriculture department said 
thursday 
this would be the largest crop since 1982 and the third 
largest on record the department said in a report 
and it will be a nearrecord production at that records show 
the biggest us wheat crops were backtoback in 1981 with 279 
billion bushels and 1982 with 277 billion 
new production estimates for the first time this season included 
durum and other springplanted wheat in addition to winter wheat 
planted last fall 
the departments agricultural statistics board said the average 
yield based on indications as of july 1 was estimated at 386 
bushels per acre compared with 328 bushels last year 
farmers are expected to harvest about 70 million acres of wheat 
this year also the most since 1982 the 1989 crop was from 621 
million harvested acres 
the departments first official estimate of 1990 corn soybeans 
and some other major springplanted crops will be issued aug 9 
along with an updated estimate of wheat production 
winter wheat production was estimated at 204 billion bushels 
down 3 percent from the june forecast but up 40 percent from the 
1989 harvest winter wheat makes up about threefourths of the us 
total 
yields in many of the winter wheat states are down from the june 
forecast especially in illinois and missouri the report said the 
huge kansas crop at 4602 million bushels was unchanged from last 
month 
durum wheat production was estimated at 114 million bushels up 
24 percent from last year and other spring wheat was indicated at 
549 million bushels up 12 percent from 1989 
north dakota the biggest durum producer was estimated at 976 
million bushels compared with 66 million bushels last year the 
states production of other spring wheat also the largest was 
estimated at 2544 million bushels up from 174 million in 1989 
government crop watchers said earlier this week that the 
nations wheat harvest was 71 percent completed by july 8 slightly 
ahead of the fiveyear average for this time 
the july report also estimated barley production at 414 million 
bushels up 3 percent from last year yields were indicated at 534 
bushels per acre up 49 bushels from 1989 
oats production was estimated at 375 million bushels virtually 
the same as last year with average yields at 602 bushels per 
acre compared with last seasons 544 bushels 
fluecured tobacco production was forecast at 856 million 
pounds up 6 percent from last year reflecting a larger acreage 
in a related supplyanddemand report highly tentative 
projections of 1990 production of corn showed the fall harvest 
might total 785 billion bushels 
that would be down from the 81 billion bushels projected in 
june but still larger than the 1989 harvest of 753 billion 
bushels 
among many contributing factors are late plantings in parts of 
the corn belt an extended period of hot dry weather in the south 
and slightly less planted area than indicated by a survey in 
march the report said 
soybean production also was projected down 186 billion 
bushels against 193 billion projected in june last years output 
was about 193 billion bushels about what had been projected in 
june for 1990 
the analysis showed wheat prices at the farm in 199091 may 
average in the range of 280 to 320 per bushel down 10 cents 
from the june forecast last season wheat prices averaged 372 
per bushel 
corn prices reflecting tighter supplies were projected to 
average 250 to 290 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year up 
15 cents from june they are expected to be in the range of 235 
to 240 in 198990 
soybean prices were projected at 550 to 675 per bushel a 
50cent increase from the range last month the 198990 price was 
estimated at 570 per bushel 
cotton production was projected at 15 million bales down 1 
million bales from the june outlook primarily because of 
extremely hot dry conditions which have reduced prospective 
harvested acreage and trimmed potential yields in texas the 
report said 
no price information was projected for 199091 cotton

inches and have it remeasured he said 
gerry kirk and a team from san diegobased sand sculptors 
international which also built the world record sand sculpture in

populist boris n yeltsin quit the communist party 
on thursday in a move that could start the exodus of liberals that 
president mikhail s gorbachev has warned could destroy his reform 
movement 
yeltsins dramatic announcement to the 28th communist party 
congress capped a day in which his orthodox marxist foe yegor k 
ligachev was vanquished in a bid for the partys no 2 job 
for more than two years gorbachev has balanced the party 
between liberals led by yeltsin and hardliners led by ligachev 
the departure of gorbachevs two antagonists marked a triumph for 
gorbachevs centrist politics 
but it could prove a hollow victory yeltsin took with him some 
of the most reformminded party members leaders of the democratic 
platform reform movement announced they would follow yeltsin out of 
the party and form a rival group 
other delegates who favor yeltsins demands for faster and more 
radical economic reforms were thought likely to follow it would be 
the first split in the communist party since 1921 
yeltsin elected president of the russian republic in may on the 
strength of his populist program became the first noncommunist 
leader of that huge territory in 72 years of soviet power 
the burly whitehaired reformer strode down the center aisle to 
the podium in the kremlin palace of congresses and read without 
emotion from a sheet of paper to a silent audience 
he said that as newly elected president of russia he could no 
longer obey only the policies of the communist party 
in connection with my election as the chairman president of 
the supreme soviet of russia and my great responsibility before the 
people of russia taking into account the transition of society to 
a multiparty system i cannot fulfill only the decisions of the 
communist party he said 
i have to obey the will of the people and their allpowerful 
representatives he said therefore in connection with my 
obligations i declare my exit from the party 
yeltsins announcement was greeted with some applause whistles 
of derision and shouts of shame he left the podium and walked 
out of the congress hall without further comment 
yeltsin said he had planned to make the announcement after the 
congress but was forced to do it earlier because he was nominated 
for the partys central committee which will be elected before the 
congress adjourns 
gorbachev brought yeltsin to moscow in 1985 from the ural 
mountain industrial center of sverdlovsk but fired him as moscow 
party boss two years later for criticizing the slow pace of reform 
yeltsin rebounded by launching a populist campaign against 
gorbachev and tops the soviet leader in popularity in some polls 
gorbachev said yeltsins resignation would not be discussed at 
the congress but otherwise showed no reaction 
outside the hall however one prominent military official 
called yeltsins actions disgraceful 
marshal nikolai ogarkov said yeltsin made a shameful speech 
the communist party helped yeltsin and suddenly he throws it

oileating microbes dumped on a slick from a 
leaking tanker in the gulf of mexico apparently did their job 
gobbling up oil without hurting the environment officials said 
thursday 
state land commissioner garry mauro and texas water commission 
chairman bj buck wynne said that while more testing is 
needed there is enough evidence to push for expanded use of the 
process called bioremediation 
we have strong evidence that bioremediation works mauro 
told a news conference the results show that we are close to 
having a tool that actually cleans up oil spills 
the microbes were tested after the norwegian tanker mega borg 
exploded june 8 and burned 57 miles off galveston an estimated 39 
million gallons of light crude leaked into the gulf 
much of the oil burned but some created a slick that appeared 
headed toward the texas coast 
skimmers and booms were deployed but mauro and wynne pushed to 
test the microbes the test done first on about 40 acres of the 
spill and again on a smaller patch was not a major part of the 
cleanup 
mauro and wynne said thursday there is no evidence the microbes 
caused any environmental damage 
both said the microbes should be used again on the next 
significant oil spill and should be tested on smaller spills near 
the texas coast 
the test on the mega borg spill marked the first time the 
microbes were used in open waters bioremediation had been used 
before to clean up hazardous waste sites extract oil from tight 
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the exxon 
valdez spill in alaska last year 
the naturally occurring bacteria reduce the oil to an emulsion 
of fatty acids which sinks and is eaten by fish when the oil is 
gone the microbes die 
we found surface oil was reduced after the application and we 
found no similar reduction in the control slick mauro said the 
surface oil in some samples was reduced to 30 percent of the 
original volume he said 
wynne and mauro conceded that weather and currents may have 
helped disperse the oil but were confident the microbes did their 
duty 
the best that anything else in our oil spill response arsenal 
can do is mitigate disaster mauro said 
the next step he said is persuading companies to include 
bioremediation in their oil spill contingency plans

loggers cant harvest parts of 
privately owned forests where threatened spotted owls live under 
rules adopted by a state panel the decision could make california 
the first state to officially protect the species 
timber industry leaders immediately blasted wednesdays decision 
by the state board of forestry that could cut logging in northern 
california in half and could cost up to 1900 jobs 
im here representing the 25000 people who are going to be 
out of work because of your decision today said gil murray of 
the timber association of california 
environmentalists supported the decision because it protects old 
growth redwood trees where spotted owls have been found but they 
said a harvesting moratorium is needed 
weve got to become the first state to shut the door on this 
destruction to preserve jobs forests and a healthy planet said 
mark heitchue a santa cruz member of the environmental group earth 
first 
the regulations would take effect july 23 if they are approved 
by the states office of administrative law the rules would be in 
effect during the next three months until a more comprehensive 
protection plan is approved 
in june the us fish and wildlife service put the spotted owl 
on the threatened species list setting up the battle between the 
timber industry and environmentalists 
the regulations which apply to all counties north of marin 
dont ban logging entirely within areas where the owl lives but 
landowners wont be allowed to cut timber within 15 miles of where 
a spotted owl has been seen 
ross johnson chief of forest practice regulations for the 
california department of forestry and fire protection estimated 
timber yields will decrease from 35 percent to 50 percent under the 
temporary rules 
it could cost between 968 and 1901 jobs in lumber and related 
industries depending on how the rules are enforced he said 
biologists estimate that about 5000 pairs of spotted owls have 
survived recent years of clearcutting of old growth forests in 
washington oregon and california

democrats and republicans took turns thursday 
decrying alleged tax dodging by us subsidiaries of foreign 
corporations but the treasury department would not concede there 
is wholesale cheating 
i propose were talking about billions in the range of 30 
billion a year in tax avoidance said rep jj pickle dtexas 
chairman of the house ways and means oversight subcommittee 
other members of the panel which has been investigating the 
problem for nine months put the figure at 50 billion 
we really do not have a way of estimating the tax loss said 
kenneth gideon assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy 
i would find 50 billion very hard to accept because the us 
take from all corporations is only about twice that figure 
rep ronnie flippo dala asked if foreigncontrolled 
corporations were paying their share 
thats a question i cant answer gideon replied 
in many cases what we have is criminal conduct said rep 
clay shaw rfla the way these companies are operating i 
find incredible 
these companies are paying less than the average citizen the 
average taxpayers of the united states said rep richard 
schulze rpa thats abominable 
noting a movement to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit 
schulze shouted ill be damned if ill do it while billions of 
dollars are floating overseas 
that sentiment was echoed by lawmakers as diverse as house 
majority leader richard gephardt dmo and sen jesse helms 
rnc 
the internal revenue service told the subcommittee earlier this 
week that foreign subsidiaries operating in the united states had 
revenues of 686 billion in 1987 and paid federal income tax of 
456 billion 
that rate of 066 percent of revenues compares with 104 percent 
paid that same year by usowned corporations 
subcommittee investigators examined 36 giant companies that 
distribute foreignmade automobiles motorcycles and consumer 
electronic goods in this country and found that more than half paid 
little or no tax over a 10year period 
the chief means of avoiding us tax was through a practice 
known as transfer pricing a foreign company could charge its us 
subsidiary an artificially high price for television sets for 
example thus lowering the amount of income subject to us tax 
such price manipulation also can worsen the us trade deficit 
and make it more difficult for american companies to compete 
abroad witnesses told the subcommittee 
michael e granfield vice chancellor of the university of 
california los angeles who assisted the irs in an earlier case 
against japanese automobile companies said there is a serious 
compliance problem 
granfield said the irs is hampered by a lack of resources and 
the inability to pay salaries high enough to retain personnel who 
can match expertise with industry economists and lawyers but the 
agency has other problems of its own creation including a penchant 
for seeking settlements that are so high as to be 
counterproductive he said 
it is transparent that the irs is not doing an adequate job in 
this area granfield said 
pickle expressed hope that the subcommittees investigation not 
be viewed as aimed solely as japanese corporations although 
government officials are barred by law from disclosing the names of 
taxpayers being investigated by the irs most of the criticism of 
subcommittee members has been aimed at japanese companies though 
not by name 
rep duncan hunter of california chairman of the house 
republican research committee released a list of japanese 
companies that he said have been identified in public reports as 
being under irs investigation 
the list included many of the japanese companies best known to 
americans including hitachi toshiba sony nissan toyota yamaha 
and matsushita electric panasonic

congress would be better off forcing bank 
owners to invest more capital in their institutions than scaling 
back the 100000 limit on deposit insurance federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan said thursday 
greenspan told the senate banking committee he did not flatly 
oppose an insurance reduction but he warned that lowering the 
limit would involve significant transition costs 
he acknowledged the need for change in the wake of the savings 
and loan crisis but said deposit insurance has lent stability to 
the financial system 
deposit insurance allowed thrift owners to gamble on 
investments knowing they may reap the profits if they succeeded 
but taxpayers would pick up most of the loss if they failed 
however it also has been the major reason why the united 
states has not suffered a financial panic or systemic bank run in 
the last halfcentury the chairman said 
reform is required so is caution he added 
the most promising approach would be to force bank and sampl 
owners to risk more of their own capital he said that should be 
coupled with improved supervision to make sure banks use sound 
practices are reined in when they weaken and closed promptly if 
they fail 
more capital is needed particularly if as the board advocates 
banks are allowed to engage in activities traditionally forbidden 
to them such as securities underwriting he said 
thursdays banking committee hearing was 10th in a series of 13 
intended to lay the groundwork for next years debate on an 
overhaul of the financial and banking system 
greenspans views generally carry great weight with members of 
congress the bush administration is expected to make its own 
recommendations in a report late this year 
the 1980 decision by congress and the carter administration to 
boost deposit insurance from 40000 per account to 100000 is 
often cited as one of the root causes of the savings and loan 
crisis 
advocates of cutting the limit include conservatives who oppose 
government intervention in the economy and populists who believe 
the 100000 deposit insurance limit protects rich people at the 
expense of average taxpayers 
if we were starting from scratch the board believes it would 
be difficult to make the case that deposit insurance coverage 
should be as high as the current 100000 level greenspan said 
however he said it is one thing initially to offer and 
then maintain a smaller degree of insurance coverage and quite 
another to reimpose on the existing system a lower level of 
insurance with its associated readjustment and unwinding costs 
the central bank chairman also said congress should exercise 
care in increasing risks to uninsured deposits over the 100000 
limit 
runs of uninsured deposits from banks under stress have become 
commonplace so far the pressure transmitted from such episodes to 
other banks whose strength may be in doubt has been minimal he 
said

marion barry used drugs and drank heavily 
before collapsing at a 1987 super bowl party a friend testified 
thursday at the mayors cocaine and perjury trial 
jeffrey mitchell said barry was rushed to a hospital and given 
oxygen but then said he didnt want any tests and walked out 
the two men used cocaine on at least 10 occasions from 1985 to 
1987 testified mitchell an advertising executive who has worked 
on barrys mayoral campaigns 
in major areas his testimony supported that of another barry 
friend who told the jury on wednesday of a conversation with 
mitchell about the super bowl episode but the two witnesses 
disagreed on several points including whose idea it was to steer 
clear of tests at the hospital 
lawyer lloyd moore had testified that mitchell told him he had 
refused to allow blood tests on barry mitchell testified thursday 
that he did not intervene 
at a 1987 super bowl party in los angeles mitchell testified 
he found the mayor slumped in a chair with his head back and 
pinching his nose 
earlier they had smoked a marijuana cigarette and barry drank 
champagne a fifth of cognac and wine said mitchell 
barry was sniffing heavily trying to clear an air passage and 
he looked uncomfortable mitchell testified he said he was 
having trouble breathing 
had there been other times when barry made those sounds asked 
assistant us attorney judith retchin 
yes often after we had done cocaine said mitchell 
mitchell said he helped barry out of the chair and told him to 
take deep breaths but it didnt help 
he felt like he was going to faint mitchell said of barry 
after barry was taken to an emergency room in an ambulance he 
was given oxygen and seemed to feel a little stronger he wanted 
to leave he said he didnt want any tests said mitchell 
barry did leave the hospital the witness said 
the official explanation given at the time for barrys collapse 
was that he had suffered a hiatal hernia 
another witness thursday darrell sabbs said that he and the 
mayor snorted cocaine together on four occasions between 1986 and 
last september 
sabbs traveled to washington on jan 19 for barrys planned 
announcement that he was running for reelection but barry was 
arrested the night of jan 18 in an fbi sting operation and charged 
with cocaine possession 
by the time sabbs got in town there had been this entrap 
sting or whatever testified sabbs who was a reluctant 
prosecution witness 
the day after barrys arrest sabbs spoke to the mayor by 
telephone and told him that i loved him and to take care of 
himself 
barrys defense in the sting operation is that the fbi trapped 
him into smoking crack cocaine the mayor has announced he wont 
seek reelection 
mitchell said he and barry snorted cocaine on two fishing trips 
on the chesapeake bay at a memorial day cookout on a trip to the 
bahamas and on a number of other occasions usually at mitchells 
home 
they even used cocaine by blowing it into each others mouths 
off a card he said 
he said it was barry who introduced him to cocaine putting it 
up mitchells nose with a matchbook cover or a business card during 
a fishing trip 
the ad executive said he and the mayor were close friends and he 
tried to slow barrys cocaine use by sometimes lying when asked if 
he had any 
if i knew that he was going somewhere in an official 
capacity i just said i didnt have the drug said mitchell 
i love marion barry he said 
mitchell disputed other portions of moores testimony about the 
super bowl trip moore and mitchell had a conversation about 
barrys collapse shortly after it occurred and moore testified 
about that wednesday 
moore said mitchell indicated the mayor had been smoking 
cocaine laced with something mitchell said it was moore who 
suggested that barry might have gotten hold of some bad 
stuff speed 
moore testified that the conversation with mitchell occurred in 
a telephone call mitchell testified the two talked facetoface in 
washington 
moore was strictly speculating that cocaine caused the 
collapse barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy asked on 
crossexamination 
yes replied mitchell

an advocacy group said in federal court 
thursday that the bush administration is dragging its feet on a 
judges order that surplus government property be made available 
for the homeless 
the group filed a motion seeking to enforce a 1988 permanent 
injunction requiring the federal government to correct violations 
and speed up implementation of the surplus property program 
the action was filed by the national law center on homelessness 
and poverty in us district court in washington 
the center said only 28 surplus federal properties have been 
made available to house the homeless despite a 1987 federal law and 
the 1988 court injunction issued by us district judge oliver 
gasch 
almost two years later the federal agencies are still doing 
everything possible to subvert this program said maria 
foscarinis director of the center a nonprofit advocacy group 
the federal government has barely lifted a finger to use its 
enormous existing resources to help those most in need 
the center contends in documents filed with the court that the 
department of housing and urban development has failed to 
adequately review federal properties that may be suitable for the 
homeless they also charged the application process is too 
burdensome and has discouraged nonprofit organizations from 
applying for surplus property to house homeless people 
the surplus property program was begun as part of a 1987 stewart 
b mckinney homeless assistance act which was named for its 
sponsor the late republican congressman from connecticut

a radio talk show host was suspended 
thursday for barring black listeners from calling his show he and 
the station apologized 
tim lennox said he was upset because a black man had broken into 
a station employees car and stolen her purse he told his 
listeners about the theft during hi twohour show wednesday then 
stopped blacks from calling 
i made an emotional spur of the moment decision to accept only 
calls from white listeners lennox said at the start of his 
thursday program 
i want to sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my 
actions anybody who has listened to my show for 14 years is aware 
of my liberal outlook said the 40yearold lennox who is white 
berkley fraser wercam general manager said he decided to let 
lennox go on the air thursday because he said he wanted to 
apologize to the birmingham community we let him have that 
opportunity 
fraser earlier apologized on behalf of the station and announced 
that lennox had been suspended indefinitely 
the station fraser said encourages free expression with its 
live programming and unfortunately mistakes do occur 
fraser said three station employees in the parking lot saw the 
thief knock out a window grab the purse and run 
lennox said he had not planned to continue the ban throughout 
wednesdays twohour show but did so even though some callers 
disapproved 
ive never had a show this intense before he said even 
my white callers had something to say about what i was doing so i 
decided to play it out 
callers talked about their experiences as crime victims and how 
to prevent becoming a victim but nearly half were critical of 
lennox for banning blacks 
don palmer a black man said he tried to call during the two 
hours but was not allowed on the air 
i think that as a citizen of birmingham ive got the same 
right to express my opinions palmer said in my opinion the 
whole show was biased and unfair 
during thursdays show lennox said he was proud to have been 
part of the first integrated talk show in birmingham some years 
back 
none of that excuses yesterdays show he said but it 
might provide some perspective for what happened 
president abraham woods of the birmingham chapter of the 
southern chistian leadership conference said he was surprised at 
the decision by lennox especially in light of a controversy over 
blacks not being accepted as members at the shoal creek country 
club the site of next months professional golfers association 
championship 
that was uncalledfor action on his part woods said it 
really bordered on stupidity in this day and time 
woods could not be reached for reaction to the apologies and 
suspension

the presidents of nigeria and 
the ivory coast met thursday to consider proposals to end the civil 
war in liberia including the introduction of an african 
peacekeeping force 
nigerias ibrahim babangida said there had been talks on the 
peacekeeping proposal and i do hope as time goes by a lot of 
things will come out of the discussions we had 
ivorian president felix houphouetboigny listening to 
babangidas remarks following three hours of talks nodded in 
agreement 
babangida said the two presidents were awaiting further word 
from diplomats in freetown sierra leone who were meeting with 
rebel representatives thursday 
the two presidents have become key figures in regional efforts 
to negotiate an end to the conflict which has degenerated into a 
tribal war that has claimed several thousand lives since it began 
in late december 
houphouetboignys government has been sympathetic to rebel 
leader charles taylor while babangida reportedly has sent arms to 
liberian president samuel doe 
if the two leaders back a proposal to send a peacekeeping force 
to liberia it would increase pressure on taylors rebels to accept 
it taylor has bitterly opposed the plan which the rebels see as 
an effort to stop them from toppling does government just as they 
are at the gates of the capital 
it seemed unlikely the rebels would want to offend 
houphouetboigny from whose country they launched their invasion 
of liberia or babangida because nigeria is west africas military 
powerhouse 
said babangida both of us are concerned about liberia there 
has to be a solution my visit will give us time to review possible 
solutions 
houphouetboigny a roman catholic also took babangida on a 
tour of the colossal basilica he built here at a cost of more than 
150 million pope john paul ii will visit the church which rivals 
st peters in size for its official consecration sept 10

movie stars kathleen turner and kevin kline 
met with members of congress thursday and urged rejection of 
proposals to place restrictions on federal grants for the arts 
kline who starred in the movie the big chill said the 
controversy over the national endowment for the arts is a kind of 
hysteria that is making artists become suddenly suspicious 
characters 
the nea is a wonderful program it should be protected and 
perpetuated kline told reporters were heading toward if 
were not careful a sort of cultural illiteracy 
turner who starred in body heat said the issue amounts to 
whether one has the right to tell another person even supposedly 
for their own good how they should do their job 
the two attended a private lunch with members of the 
congressional arts caucus a group of members interested in the 
arts and later spoke briefly with reporters 
bills to continue the nea are pending in both the house and 
senate and a fight is expected over several proposals to apply 
provisions restricting federal subsidies from going to art that is 
deemed obscene sacrilegious or otherwise offensive

the chairman of a house panel on thursday 
urged defense secretary dick cheney to halt any more purchases of 
apache helicopters because of problems with the allweather 
aircraft 
i understand the contracts could be signed within the next few 
days this should be stopped rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of a house energy and commerce subcommittee said in a 
letter to cheney 
the general accounting office recommended to the committee in 
april that the army not buy the final 132 aircraft at a cost of 
149 billion 
the gao the investigative arm of congress found that six of 
the best apaches the army handpicked for the invasion of panama 
last december were plagued by problems 
one helicopter never took off because of a hydraulic failure 
the fuel cell failed in another and still another was forced to 
return to the base when its target detection system didnt work 
the gao said 
complicating matters were the helicopters sensitive electronic 
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused 
moisture to build up army officials were forced to dry the parts 
in kitchen ovens the gao said 
army secretary michael pw stone said the service did not 
dispute the gao findings but is making progress in rectifying the 
problems 
the apache is the finest attack helicopter in the world an 
aircraft that has given the united states a capability that is the 
envy of the world stone told the subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
the army plans to buy 807 apaches from mcdonnell douglas at a 
cost of 12 billion its committed to 675 and the last 132 would 
cost 149 billion which has already been appropriated for the 
current fiscal year 
dingell in his letter said the current plan is not my idea 
of rational decisionmaking apart from the illogic of a decision 
to buy more apaches such a decision would limit your budgeting 
options at a time when you most need them

the republican party opened its midyear meeting 
thursday with an aggressive counterattack against democrats seeking 
to blame the savings and loan crisis on president bush and the gop 
edward rollins cochairman of the gops congressional 
committee led the effort by accusing congressional democrats of 
causing the sampl debacle and delivering a caustic assault on 
democratic values and priorities 
theyve become corrupt complacent and cocky rollins said 
in a speech to the republican national committee now its time 
for a comeuppance 
democrats including several potential 1992 presidential 
contenders have tried to gain a political edge by blaming the 300 
billionplus sampl bailout on the reagan and bush administrations 
but rollins said blame for the crisis rested with the majority 
democrats in congress he singled out three fallen democrats 
former house speaker jim wright former house whip tony coelho and 
former house banking committee chairman fernand st germain wright 
and coelho resigned last year amid ethics questions and st germain 
was defeated in 1988 
they and other democrats rollins said took millions of dollars 
from the sampl industry in the 1980s and refused to act when 
significant evidence of a looming crisis first surfaced 
if money is the mothers milk of politics the democratic 
fundraisers who were getting rich by looting sampls were the 
milkmen rollins said for a few million dollars in campaign 
contributions the democrats sold out the taxpayers for the sake 
of their own reelections they left us a bailout legacy that could 
reach the cost of thousands for every taxpayer for generations 
democratic party chairman ronald brown returned rollins fire 
and predicted that gop efforts to claim the high ground on sampls 
would fail 
were not surprised that casino economy republicans who 
gambled us into this whole mess are whining and scapegoating every 
step of the way brown said in a statement none of it is going 
to work 
when the democrats latched on to the sampl bailout as a partisan 
issue republican officials said they did not think the pitch would 
resonate with voters but some gop leaders give the democrats 
credit for trying to exploit the bailout as a political issue 
because of growing taxpayer anger over the its cost 
for once a party without leadership has agreed on one 
thing said mary matalin the rnc executive director were not 
going to sit there and let them define the debate 
the effort by rollins and other senior republicans to blunt the 
attack was a clear indication the gop is concerned about the 
democratic salvos 
were fighting back said gop consultant charles black who 
has been helping run the rnc while party chairman lee atwater 
battles a brain tumor democrats not only arent clean on this 
issue but a lot of their leaders are the people who caused the 
problem 
rnc member haley barbour of mississippi a party strategist in 
the south said democrats are going to get their fingers burned 
on this as often as they are going to have success 
it appears the gop would be happy with a political draw on the 
sampl issue 
republicans too accepted millions from sampl interests and with 
bushs son neil involved in a highly publicized sampl case the 
democrats have ample fodder for attacks on the gop 
atwater who was hospitalized in washington for what aides said 
were routine tests related to treatment of his tumor has urged 
rollins and other party operatives to be more aggressive in 
answering the democratic attacks 
rollins speech was rich with rhetoric sure to be repeated this 
fall in the congressional races around the country although gop 
prospects for cutting into the democratic majority appear bleak 
this year rollins is betting heavily on making inroads in 1992 
rollins delivered personal attacks on a handful of democratic 
lawmakers and offered a sarcastic assessment of the party overall 
labeling it soft on crime eager to raise taxes and reliant on a 
divisive platform of class warfare for support 
answering the concerns of many republican leaders gathered for 
the twoday meeting rollins said bush abandoned his no new 
taxes pledge because it was the only way to get democrats to 
agree to spending cuts 
he warned that democrats may try to blame the republicans should 
cuts in social security and other entitlement programs emerge from 
ongoing budget talks between congress and the white house 
privately many of the rnc members have expressed worries that 
bushs reversal on taxes will hurt gop candidates this fall but 
there was no public effort to question the president and party 
officials made it clear the white house likely would oppose any 
efforts to raise personal income taxes as part of a tax package 
a good economy is good politics bush pollster bob teeter 
told the rnc saying bush needed to give up his tax pledge to spur 
a deficitreduction package there is no worse politics than a 
recession

prospects are still good for a bumper grain 
harvest in the soviet union this year the agriculture department 
said thursday 
total grain production continues to be estimated at 215 million 
metric tons up from 2111 million tons in 1989 the department 
said in a report that would be the largest since a record 2374 
million tons were harvested in 1978 
soviet grain imports for the 199091 year that began july 1 also 
were unchanged from the previous forecast 36 million tons compared 
with 38 million tons in 198990 
but officials said the soviet union would probably boost its 
wheat imports to 17 million tons up 1 million tons from the 
previous forecast and reduce imports of coarse grains by the same 
amount 
analysts said the shift was due mostly to widening price spreads 
between lowerquality wheat used for livestock feed and corn

ships from three nations sailed on 
thursday to a rendezvous off albania in a sea lift of more than 
4500 albanians seeking to escape their homeland europes last 
haven for hardline communists 
five ships were engaged by france italy and west germany to 
ferry the refugees 85 miles across the adriatic from durres 
albania to the southern italian port of brindisi a voyage of five 
to seven hours 
the exodus was expected to ease a 2weekold crisis created by 
albanians storming foreign embassies in tirana seeking asylum some 
braved police gunfire others crashed through embassy compound 
walls in trucks or scrambled over walls 
the embassies have been struggling to feed and shelter the 
albanians many of them young people 
they will all arrive tomorrow friday said franco loparco 
president of the italian red cross in brindisi 
a foreign ministry spokesman said the ships would meet up off 
durres but further details would be withheld at the request of the 
albanian government 
the italian news agency ansa without citing its sources said 
albania doesnt want the ships to dock and that the asylumseekers 
will be transferred from shore to the foreign vessels by albanian 
boats 
two greekowned ferries chartered by the west german 
government arrived at durres thursday afternoon a spokesman for 
the shipowner said together the two vessels can carry 1900 
passengers 
two italian ships were bound for albania from venice and 
brindisi and a frenchchartered ship set sail for albania from 
greece 
the first ship is due shortly after dawn most of the arrivals 
will be given coffee and croissants and then put on three trains 
headed for west germany 
west german diplomats in brindisi said 3200 albanians who took 
refuge in their embassy in tirana albanias capital would make 
the sea crossing earlier italian officials put that figure at 
2200 
figures on the total number of albanian asylumseekers also 
varied an earlier version put it at more than 5000 
among those expected to arrive was a baby born wednesday at the 
west german embassy diplomats in tirana said 
the germanybound refugees will be given medical examinations 
and a chance to shower in brindisi before boarding trains for a 
30hour journey 
giuseppe mazzitello brindisis administrative chief said the 
port would be closed to tourist traffic friday brindisi is in the 
heel of italy about 330 miles southeast of rome 
only 51 of the refugees had left albania to now the small group 
in the czechoslovak embassy was flown to prague early monday 
albania agreed to let the refugees leave the embassy compounds 
after supplies of food and medicine ran low and hygienic conditions 
deteriorated 
the approximately 800 albanians who took refuge in the italian 
embassy will be given temporary shelter in a military camp near 
brindisi about 540 from the french embassy will continue to france 
by ship after stopping in brindisi authorities said 
a final destination will be determined in the refugees host 
country many say they hope to go to the united states 
soldiers wearing yellow rubber gloves used wirecutters to 
remove coils of barbed wire from concrete walls around the 
perimeter of the camp thursday 
we are taking down the barbed wire so it doesnt seem like a 
concentration camp said lt col michele dodde 
loparco said the red cross expected to treat about a dozen 
wounded including three or four people with fractures and several 
with kidney problems 
hungarys state news agency mti said hungary will fly the 40 
albanians in its embassy to budapest friday night 
the assault on the embassies presented the biggest challenge in 
decades to the albanian government 
it was reminiscent of the rush on foreign embassies in east 
germany last year that contributed to the collapse of the countrys 
communist government 
albanian leader ramiz alia introduced limited reforms this year 
including some religious freedoms and travel abroad 
the crisis caused a shakeup in the leadership but the 
government said it will maintain its hard line 
some albanians who arrived this week in prague speculated that 
communist rule in their country may last only a year or two more 
i give communism in my country one or two years said kola 
36yearold albanian construction worker kola who gave only his 
first name is housed with other refugees in a barracks outside 
prague 
it was intolerable we all dreaded the isolation he said

at i70 truck city on thursday resting 
drivers expressed indignation and doubt about a government proposal 
to make them buckle up while working 
a lot of people might be for it but im against it they can 
tell me how fast to drive but i dont think they should be able to 
say get in and strap yourself in this thing said ed england 
a trucker from hopkinsville ky 
the regulation the us labor department proposed wednesday 
would cover 54 million businesses with 35 million workers like 
jerry aiello a 48yearold truck driver from upland calif also 
taking a break at the truck stop 
aiello wears his seat belt when the road gets bumpy but doesnt 
like the way it cuts into his belly on long hauls and he doesnt 
think the government can force him to buckle up 
i dont see how theyre going to enforce it they cant even 
enforce the drug laws said aiello who was hauling lumber on 
interstate 70 in western maryland 
under the proposed occupational safety and health 
administration rule workers who drive or ride on the job would 
have to wear seat belts selfemployed people and businesses with 
10 or fewer employees would be exempt 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said the new rules could save up 
to 685 lives a year she said automobile accidents were the single 
largest cause of occupational fatalities causing about 2100 
jobrelated deaths a year 
it could cost lives too said england 36 who was headed 
to georgia with a load of syrup used to flavor cigars 
england said he was glad he wasnt wearing a seat belt when his 
truck crashed into the rear of another last year 
the whole front end of the cab came through the windshield 
england said the cop said if i had been seat beltedin i 
wouldnt have been there to talk about it 
bill thomas 42 a trucker from terre haute ind said he was 
willing to risk a ticket in the more than 30 states that have 
mandatory seat belt laws 
i dont wear a seat belt not in a truck said thomas who 
was fined for not wearing a seat belt in illinois at the time i 
was hauling gasoline 
im afraid of fire ive seen too many people burn up if 
youre upside down and your arms are trapped what are you going to 
do 
thomas who was taking a load of appliances from baltimore to 
columbus ohio said he did not see how the government could 
enforce the regulation 
i think the government is overstepping its bounds thomas 
said to me it should be a choice except for small kids in a 
car or something 
dole admitted enforcement would be difficult federal inspectors 
would make checks of seatbelt use part of their routine 
businesses guilty of violations could be fined up to 10000 she 
said 
vince carter 27 who was delivering packages in downtown 
frederick said his employer united parcel service requires 
drivers to wear seat belts 
our company says its mandatory from stop to stop said 
carter it seems reasonable it might even be able to help 
insurance costs a little 
but curt king 36 a driver for city cab co in frederick said 
seat belt laws infringe on his freedom 
if you want to get splattered on the highway its your 
right said king who does not buckle up its just a nuisance 
i just personally feel that it isnt anybodys business

the education department began mailing public 
and private schools advice thursday on how to teach children the 
dangers of drug abuse and warning against using recovering 
alcoholics and drug addicts in classrooms 
education secretary lauro cavazos released the drug education 
model which is being sent to about 122000 schools and described 
it as a blueprint for effective techniques and suggestions for 
classroom activities 
recovering alcoholics and drug addicts should not be used in 
classroom presentations that try to discourage youngsters from 
experimenting with illegal drugs the department said 
one of the dangers of using recovering addicts in prevention 
programs is that we might be giving a mixed message i tried it 
ive recovered and im driving away in my bmw said dick hayes 
head of the agencys drug abuse prevention program 
where recovering addicts seem to have a role is particularly 
in intervention and treatment this is the consensus in the 
field he said 
cavazos said the program was divided into four academic levels 
kindergarten through grade three grades four through six seven 
through eight and nine through 12 
education is our best hope for a drugfree america cavazos 
said 
each element contains suggestions for teachers on how they can 
work effectively with parents and with agencies in the community a 
lesson plan defines the specific learning objective with suggested 
activities and resources required 
drug prevention lessons are included throughout core academic 
subjects including mathematics science language arts social 
studies health or physical education classes art or music classes 
the model won immediate praise from rep lawrence coughlin 
rpa and the national school boards association which is urging 
all of its members to give careful review to the document 
rep charles rangel dny who has complained the 
administration isnt doing enough to promote drug prevention 
praised the curriculum but questioned whether there is incentive to 
ensure schools will use it 
as promising as this curriculum appears to be and knowing the 
secretarys good intentions it would be a shame and a waste of 
resources if this were not put into action far and wide said 
rangel 
cavazos said the model contains clear unequivocal messages 
that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful and that any drug use 
involves risk by using looseleaf binders he said educators can 
incorporate material developed by local school districts 
the model is being sent to about school principals and 
superintendents as well as to the 1500 largest private schools 
and members of the chief state school officers

government agencies must help eastern european 
teachers and union officials reform their education system the 
american federation of teachers said thursday 
aft president albert shanker said the ideas and principles of 
democracy will take root only if they are taught effectively to the 
next generation 
the aft to encourage democracy in education in eastern europe 
developed a sevenpoint agenda detailing steps that can be taken by 
governmental agencies shanker said 
a key emphasis of the program part of the afts education for 
democracyinternational and estimated to cost 100 million is to 
get more assistance from congress and the federal government to 
help central and eastern europe overcome a lack of educational 
resources he said 
but shanker stressed that private foundations state education 
departments colleges and universities all must play a role in 
promoting the teaching of the history principles and practices of 
democracy 
the education for democracyinternational project began early 
this year as an extension of a program launched in 1987 to advocate 
strengthening the teaching of democratic values in the united 
states 
teachers in eastern europe are for the first time in 45 years 
able to teach nonpropagandistic history literature economics 
and politics he said but there are no textbooks for these 
subjects except those produced by the communist governments to 
indoctrinate students about the accomplishments of communism 
zoltan pokorni national spokesman for the democratic teachers 
union in hungary said the us information agency told him it 
would expand its fulbright exchange program for teachers and other 
education programs

teachers in the five eastern european countries but fewer than 
5000 teachers of western languages 
pokorni said about 10000 hungarian and 18000 polish russian 
teachers are expected to lose their jobs the exchange programs 
could help many of them find new classroom jobs such as teaching 
english 
the aft plan also calls for providing tax incentives and other 
assistance to public and private american universities willing to 
open branches in various eastern european countries and 
establishing special englishlanguage training schools and teacher

staff powell is on a fivenation middle east tour 
i mentioned the arrow project to gen powell since he is 
familiar with it i understood that he greatly appreciates israels 
technological achievements in this field which in many respects 
are indeed unprecedented arens said on israel radio 
i think weve apparently found an answer to groundtoground 
missiles arens added we expect the us administration to 
continue funding this project so that we t 
washington provided 80 percent of the 158 million for the first 
phase of the arrow project israels defense ministry supplied the 
rest israel wants about 200 million from washington for the 
second phase 
arens said the arrow was discussed in the context of iraqi 
threats to use missilecarried chemical weapons against israel in 
retaliation for any attack 
the arrow is designed to defend against ballistic missiles with 
a range of 600 miles or less 
the star wars program is mainly conducting research into the 
feasibility of spacebased defenses against ballistic missile 
attacks 
the bush administration spent 1 billion on the program the past 
fiscal year but its 45 billion request for the next year is 
expected to come under severe attack in the us congress 
the programs critics contend the system is too expensive and 
unnecessary in this time of lessened eastwest tensions 
however defense secretary dick cheney has touted the programs 
possibilities to counter the growing threat of third world 
ballistic missiles 
cheney has also argued the soviets spacedbased defense 
research is continuing

the man just picked to run the daily affairs of 
the soviet communist party charted a middle ground thursday 
backing quick reform and tolerance for many views but warning of 
illconceived leaps 
vladimir a ivashko the personal choice of soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev trounced party traditionalist yegor k 
ligachev in an election to choose the partys no 2 leader at the 
28th communist party congress 
in his first meeting with reporters after his victory ivashko 
on thursday proclaimed himself a staunch supporter of gorbachevs 
policies who nevertheless was very surprised to find himself the 
soviet leaders new deputy 
i will make every effort to consolidate the party to 
accommodate different points of view in the party he told a news 
conference 
he urged party members contemplating defection from the party to 
remain because the party under gorbachev is able to solve all 
the tasks put forward by perestroika he said perestroika is 
president gorbachevs program of social and economic reforms 
however only hours later radical reformer boris n yeltsin 
announced to the congress he was quitting the party leading 
members of the democratic platform a reform group said they would 
follow suit 
in his comments thursday ivashko showed the influence of his 
many years as a teacher the 58yearold spoke forcefully using 
examples and hand gestures to buttress his arguments 
ivashko was picked last fall to replace longtime ukrainian 
communist party chief vladimir v shcherbitsky who retired 
the deputy party leaders position is new gorbachev needs a 
deputy to run much of the partys business because he spends much 
time on government business as soviet president 
the new deputy said he only learned tuesday he would be 
gorbachevs choice 
when i came here to the congress i never never thought that 
my life would change so drastically he said 
he said he had not had a chance to discuss his exact duties with 
gorbachev 
he spoke out emphatically for speedy reform but said the party 
and soviet government also had to avoid costly mistakes 
gorbachevs reform effort begun in 1985 was 20 years too late 
in coming he declared 
now he said i am for moving forward fast i see no other 
option there is no way back 
but he said the leadership had to avoid the kinds of mistakes it 
made in the first years of gorbachevs reforms 
i am against illconceived leaps forward backwards 
sideways he said perestroika proves that we have made many 
erroneous decisions quickly designed to solve all problems 
although backing transition to a market economy he stuck to 
gorbachevs line that the moves cannot be made hastily 
he said a 1985 drive against alcoholism the first largescale 
reform effort tried under gorbachev caused huge moral and 
financial damage and damage to the health of the people 
the campaign took billions of rubles from alcohol sales out of 
the national treasury it also encouraged moonshiners whose 
lowquality brew killed and injured many people 
ivashko also said the soviet government was foolhardy to agree 
to demands it knew it could not fulfull in response to a strike 
last year by soviet miners 
on wednesday hundreds of thousands of miners struck for one day 
to demand the resignation of the government the nationalization of 
communist party property and removal of party groups from the 
workplace and security forces

photographers say a famous lone cypress 
tree on the coast near carmel is a natural monument and that anyone 
can take a picture of it for any reason 
but the company that owns its rocky perch warns commercial 
photographers away insisting the tree not just the logo it 
inspired is a trademark 
the pebble beach co does not mind anyone photographing the 
tree for private purposes what it does object to is the commercial 
exploitation of its own property by others without its consent 
said kerry smith a san francisco lawyer for the resort company 
the tree which stands alone on a windswept finger of rock that 
juts into the pacific is a popular tourist stop on the 17mile 
drive just north of carmel about 85 miles south of san francisco 
although the tree has been recorded on film for a century 
including by renowned photographers ansel adams and edward weston 
the scenic golf resort recently told two professional photographers 
not to use pictures of the tree without its consent 
the action and trademark claim have evoked bewilderment 
amusement skepticism and outrage 
this just knocked me over i thought the tree was made by 
god said los angeles photographer craig aurness who got a 
warning letter from the company after his picture of the tree was 
used in an mci brochure last fall 
pebble beach co also denied photographer ed young of carmel 
permission to take pictures of the cypress if he planned to use 
them for commercial purposes 
im sure ansel adams and edward weston didnt have to get 
anything in writing young said in a letter of protest to the 
company 
the pebble beach co warns visitors in a brochure that 
unauthorized commercial photography is not allowed and it has 
registered several depictions of the tree as a trademark and uses 
them on company letterhead golf clubs balls caps and other items 
at the resort smith said 
the trademark includes the tree itself as well as abstract and 
realistic depictions of it he said 
the lone cypress itself has been the symbol and trademark of 
the pebble beach co and its predecessors since 1916 he said 
but photographers people who sell their work and experts in 
intellectual property law disagree with the trademark claim or 
say the issue is unclear 
what is trademarkable is your logo or illustration said 
nancy wolff partner in the new york law firm of cavallo and wolff 
representing aurness that doesnt mean the tree is 
trademarkable theyre trying to get a monopoly over a natural 
object because they have this drawing 
critics of the pebble beach co also argue that the cypress is 
in the public domain pointing out that people were taking pictures 
of it long before the area became a resort 
the tree is in my opinion a worldrenowned symbol said 
allison worthern graphics manager of a carmel gallery its part 
of us here we already put a price on so many things in this 
world that belong to god and nature

transit authority workers said thursday theyre 
determined to catch a wily nonpaying invader a raccoon 
thats taken residence at a downtown train stop 
rocky the raccoon has been able to give us the slip somehow 
peter poholik director of the citys commission on animal care 
control conceded on thursday weve been out there the last 
three days trying to get close enough to grab him 
transit officials say if the raccoon is cornered it may be a 
threat to riders 
we want to get this nonpaying invader off of our system 
spokesman don yabush said 
poholik a veterinarian and the transit authoritys security 
officers rose early thursday in the latest attempt to capture the 
elusive raccoon 
armed with a tranquilizer gun and bait they were hoisted on a 
small platform into the rafters beneath the tracks as trains roared 
by above but the raccoon spotted on the preceding two mornings 
on a particular rafter above the street was having nothing of it 
never saw him poholik said glumly 
a trap set in the rafters which would catch the raccoon alive 
had malfunctioned closing as the vibrations of the trains shook 
it poholik on thursday added more fragrant peanut butter bait to 
the trap and tightened its springs and latches 
because of the hoopla poholik said that if the raccoon is 
captured it would probably avoid the fate of other wild animals 
the city captures extermination 
what we will do because of all the attention is find 
some zoological society to take him off our hands 
but hes hoping its all a moot point 
theres a very good possibility that he got sidetracked 
during a nocturnal stroll and wont be coming back poholik said

the government announced thursday it has 
erased its chronic budget deficit with a new fiscal plan that 
heralds lower inflation and renewed foreign debt payments 
in the latest of a series of labor troubles however workers at 
the countrys secondlargest steel factory began a sitdown strike 
they are demanding higher wages to counter inflation in this nation 
of 150 million residents 
president fernando collor de mello is trying to combat brazils 
economic woes the country the largest debtor in the third world 
owes about 6 billion after withholding interest payments to 
private creditors for more than a year brazils inflation last 
year soared to 5000 percent 
a key to balancing the 1990 budget was the presidents 
controversial administrative reform plan said economy minister 
zelia cardoso de mello it includes selling government cars and 
mansions closing or selling dozens of stateowned companies and 
firing about 360000 federal workers 
despite a wave of labor strikes to protest the planned firings 
cardoso de mello said the price was worth paying 
de mello said brazils new budget calls for a surplus equivalent 
to 165 percent of the countrys gross national product which the 
economy ministry put at 500 billion 
earlier estimates had projected a deficit of 782 percent of the 
gnp the annual total of goods and services produced 
we have liquidated a chronic situation of fiscal imbalance 
which was one of the main causes of inflation cardoso de mello 
said in a live television interview 
to obtain the surplus the government raised tax revenue 16 
percent cut planned investments 39 percent and reduced costs 18 
percent the minister said 
she denied the spending cuts would bring recession to brazil 
we are working with the hypothesis of zero growth this year 
she said even so we cant talk of recession but rather of an 
accomodation of some sectors 
collor who took office march 15 originally promised a 2 
percent budget surplus but the minister said the 165 percent 
surplus was still a success because it shows the political 
desire to combat inflation 
inflation was 10 percent in june it is expected to rise to 12 
or 15 percent this month 
the striking steel workers were demanding a pay increase of 188 
percent to cover losses caused by the record inflation union 
leaders said 
bartolomu cideli financial director of the steel workers union 
said all 22000 workers at the national steel companys plant in 
volta redonda were taking part in the strike he said production 
had been completely halted 
cideli spoke by phone from volta redonda 80 miles west of rio 
de janeiro 
he said the strike was also to meant to protest the layoff of 
almost 1400 workers the past two months and the governments plan 
to privatize the company 
there is no way of telling how long the strike will last as 
the company is not prepared to negotiate he said but we wont 
go back to work until our basic demands are met 
in her comments the economy minister said brazil will send a 
mission to washington next week with a new budget to present to the 
international monetary fund an endorsement from the fund is 
considered essential for a new agreement with creditor banks 
private banks hold nearly 70 percent of brazils 114 billion 
foreign debt

house and senate negotiators agreed late 
thursday that most singlehulled oil tankers should be phased out 
over the next 20 years and all new tankers should be built with 
double hulls 
the agreement removed a major obstacle to oil spill protection 
legislation congress has been debating since the devastating spill 
from the exxon valdez tanker off the alaska coast in march 1989 
members working out differences between the house and senate 
bills hope to complete action on the legislation before the 
upcoming august recess 
negotiators by voice vote agreed on a compromise timetable for 
removing socalled singlehulled tankers to phase out the oldest 
and largest ships beginning in 1995 a small number of tankers 
would be allowed to operate until 2015 but most would be gone by 
2010 
environmental groups in a letter to the conferees earlier this 
week called a requirement for doublehull tankers the single most 
important step congress can take to prevent oil spills the 
petroleum industry has opposed a requirement for double hulls 
there are more than 1300 tankers of various sizes that 
transport oil in and out of the united states and between us 
ports according to congressional estimates 
double hulls provide added protection if a tanker runs aground 
or collides with another ship there have been conflicting studies 
on whether the alaska spill would have been significantly reduced 
if the exxon valdez had a double hull 
the bill approved by the senate called for only a study of issue 
and the original house version would have phased out singlehull 
tankers by 2005 
environmental groups had called for the faster phaseout 
clifton curtis of friends of the earth called the compromise a 
kiss on the cheek followed by a slap in the face 
the tanker hull issue was one of the thorniest in a package that 
also calls for a 1 billion emergency response fund to deal with 
oil spill cleanup and sets liability levels for spills the 
emergency response fund will comes from a 50centabarrel levy on 
petroleum that began being collected last january 
senate and house sources said with the doublehull issue 
resolved the legislation the subject of intense negotiations 
between the house and senate for months may be approved before 
congress begins its summer recess aug 3 
under the compromise new tankers must be constructed with 
double hulls and existing singlehull tankers must begin to be 
phased out of operation in 1995 with the largest and oldest 
tankers to be taken out of service or retrofitted first 
sen ted stevens ralaska said that under the timetable 43 
percent of tankers would likely have double hulls by the end of the 
decade and 80 percent by the year 2005 tankers that unload oil 60 
miles outside us waters and tankers that already have double 
bottom or sides have until 2015 to comply

house democrats on thursday rejected as too 
small a bush administration offer to cut military aid to el 
salvador but they held out hope for eventual agreement on a 
bipartisan policy toward the central american country 
the cuts just arent deep enough said rep joseph moakley 
dmass the leader of a democratic task force on el salvador 
appointed by house speaker thomas foley 
the initial offer was outrageously low added rep david 
bonior dmich after a twohour meeting with bernard aronson 
assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere 
according to documents made available to te associated press 
the administration proposed to cut by 15 percent el salvadors 
expected 1991 allotment of 85 million in military aid 
the withheld money would be made available to the salvadoran 
government only if several conditions were met including adherence 
by the government to a cease fire participation in negotiations 
aimed at a peaceful settlement of the 10year civil war and reforms 
of the military and judicial systems 
there also would have to be significant progress toward 
bringing to trial those responsible for the murder of eight people 
including six jesuit priests in san salvador last november 
to encourage the countrys leftist rebels to also work toward 
peace the package would provide another 15 percent could be cut if 
the rebels comply with the cease fire negotiate in good faith and 
forsake shipments of weapons from outside the country and terrorism 
although democrats rejected the plan on thursday another 
meeting was set for next week and both sides said they hoped a 
compromise could be reached 
bonior said he wanted assurances that deeper cuts would be made 
at the beginning of the fiscal year and that tighter requirements 
on the salvadoran government be written into the plan 
the administration proposal like one house democrats wrote into 
an emerging 1991 foreign aid bill is designed to give both the 
salvadoran government and the rebels incentives to resolve their 
conflict peacefully 
the congressional proposal calls for an immediate 50 percent cut 
in military aid the remaining 50 percent could be cut if the 
government abandons the peace talks or seeks to crush the fmln 
rebels militarily the full amount could be restored if the rebels 
mount a major offensive or walk away from the negotiating table 
in talks in el salvador earlier this week aronson pressed 
authorities on the jesuit murder case a report by moakleys task 
force in april said the investigation had come to a virtual 
standstill and that the salvadoran government had showed no 
interest in determining whether senior military officers were 
responsible 
el salvadors decadelong civil war has cost more than 70000 
lives and has continued despite some 5 billion in us economic 
and military aid officials have been optimistic about peace 
prospects in recent months in part because they believe diminished 
international support for the rebels will make them more flexible 
in negotiations 
the government and the guerrillas have had several rounds of 
discussions this year the next meeting is set for july 20 in costa 
rica

house speaker thomas s foley on thursday 
accused common cause the biggest public advocacy group behind 
legislation to reform election spending of conducting a 
scurrilous campaign against democrats 
foley dwash called the groups ads in the hometown 
newspapers of 13 house democrats the lowest point in the public 
presentation of issues by common cause in its history 
this is not the organization that i think carries forward the 
spirt of john gardner common causes founder and onetime 
secretary of health education and welfare foley said 
in the past month the 280000member organization chaired by 
former watergate prosecutor archibald cox has mailed out editorials 
and other material calling the leading house democratic campaign 
finance proposal a sham 
with several campaign finance bills now stalled in both the 
house and senate common cause escalated its grassroots pitch last 
week with the ads linking millions of dollars politicians received 
from political action committees to the savings and loan crisis 
under a headline reading sampl interests gave members of 
congress millions taxpayers were ripped off for billions and 
congress has done nothing the group targeted the 13 house 
democrats two senate democrats and seven senate republicans 
each of the senators was accused at the bottom of the ads of 
helping kill a campaign finance reform bill two years ago 
the ads targeting house members focused on how much money they 
received from pacs representing special interests during recent 
past elections all were urged to vote for major cuts in allowable 
pac gifts and told dont vote for the house democrats fake 
campaign reform bill 
for example a july 3 ad in the hackensack record targeted 
rep robert torricelli dnj as receiving 579000 in pac money 
the past three elections 
the ad is dishonest it is untruthful torricelli said 
citing another public interest groups determination that he had a 
nearly perfect record on sampl votes in the public interest 
they should be placing the blame where it is not saying 
that environmental organizations labor unions students senior 
citizen organizations who represent these pac contributions are 
somehow part of the problem he said 
foley accused the group of using tactics of innuendo and 
inference that are typical of the worst elements of campaign 
advertising 
common cause president fred wertheimer called the ad campaign 
fair and appropriate 
the bottom line is we have a rotten campaign finance system in 
congress and that system is one of the reasons we wound up with an 
sampl scandal that will cost every taxpayer 2500 wertheimer said

a messenger and mail room clerk with a history 
of psychiatric problems and a drug conviction was charged thursday 
in connection with the dartman attacks on women in midtown 
manhattan 
jerome wright 33 of the bronx was arrested after being 
identified in a lineup by three of the 55 women who have reported 
feeling the sting of makeshift darts aimed at their backsides 
during the past three weeks 
with wrights arrest police predicted the attacks would end 
we believe he is our darter chief joseph demartino who 
heads the manhattan detective division said at a news conference 
announcing wrights arrest 
the chief said wright admitted to the three attacks he also 
indicated to us he has been under observation for psychiatric 
problems 
demartino was less positive about the suspects motive mr 
wright has made numerous statements to us none of which has given 
us real insight into why he is doing this he said 
wright was charged with three counts each of reckless 
endangerment criminal possession of a weapon and harassment 
police said it was unlikely he would be charged in any other 
attacks since most of the women did not see their assailant 
the oddball attacks began june 26 when women started complaining 
of being stung in the buttocks legs and arms in addition to the 
manhattan attacks one woman reported being stung in queens 
the dartman targeted women in dresses or skirts and used 
homemade darts fashioned out of pins and sewing needles attached to 
paper guides most of the incidents occurred in the penn station 
and times square areas during lunchtime 
wright who is on probation until 1992 for a drug conviction 
works in the area as a messenger and mail room clerk which puts 
him on the streets during the day demartino said 
demartino said wright was stopped by two police officers tuesday 
because he fit the description of the dartman 
the officers took wrights name and address and gave it to 
detectives investigating the attacks the chief said the 
detectives called wright the next day and asked him to come in for 
questioning 
wright voluntarily went to a precinct house where he was 
questioned for more than eight hours the lineups were conducted 
late wednesday and wright was arrested early thursday 
demartino said wright is unmarried and lives with an aunt

the police radio would squawk a dispatcher 
would rasp confirmed shooting and we the zodiac watchers 
would tense so it went throughout the night as police and 
journalists waited for another strike from the man who had shot 
four people 
elsewhere in the city police had better luck against the 
dartman arresting a suspect in three of 55 dartblowing attacks on 
women 
the night of the zodiac did not see a fifth shooting by the 
astrologically obsessed gunman but the police at least half 
expected one it had been 21 days since the last shooting and two 
of the other attacks came after the same interval 
on wednesday night that fact brought out legions of police and 
press the latter to see if zodiac turned up the former to capture 
him if he did 
in the dartman case authorities said jerome wright 33 a 
messenger with a criminal record and admitted psychiatric problems 
was charged thursday after several hours of interrogation in 
connection with the firing of darts at more than 50 welldressed 
women most in midtown manhattan 
wright was identified in a lineup by three women on wednesday 
night and was charged with three counts each of reckless 
endangerment criminal possession of a weapon and harassment 
we believe he is our darter said manhattan chief of 
detectives joseph demartino 
but the search for zodiac went on my assignment was to team up 
with a photographer and stay up all night driving around listen 
to police scanners chase shooting reports get there first 
the cycle of shootings started march 8 with other shootings on 
march 29 may 31 and june 21 the time between the second and third 
shootings was 63 days a multiple of 21 each shooting had occurred 
early on a thursday of the four shooting victims one was dead 
the police had gleaned possible shooting locations from 
astrological charts occult books fbi psychological profiles and 
notes the bizarre gunman has sent to police and the media vowing 
to shoot one person from each zodiac sign 
so the photographer and i left the office at 8 pm and drove to 
the area along the brooklynqueens line where the first three 
shootings occurred here is what we saw and heard 
845 east new york at the grecian iii diner which the 
gunman referred to in his first letter to police employees say 
they recognize the zodiac sketch as that of a former customer but 
he hasnt been here in three or four weeks the manager says 
900 nichols and jamaica avenues site of zodiacs second 
shooting tom thompson 37 believes he has it figured out he 
wont be in this neighborhood tonight he says too many cops 
here this neighborhood is hot as a firecracker 
1007 units take note a dispatcher on a citywide police 
radio frequency announces operation watchdog is in effect 
operation watchdog took in 50 officers many of them decoy 
police who fanned out through the city to the suspected locations 
when the radio crackled with reports of other shootings that did 
not fit the zodiac pattern the officers were to stay put or as 
the dispatcher said at midnight designated officers will not 
respond to any incident unless confirmed incident announced 
115 central park near the scene of the last shooting not a 
soul in sight except for the occasional fourdoor sedan with two 
frontseat occupants undercover police 
suddenly the radio announces a shooting in brooklyn when we 
arrive we find it was an attempted gas station robbery an 
attendant was shot in the leg 
325 shooting in brooklyn we speed to the site but a 
plainclothes officer says zodiac is not involved your standard 
70th precinct drug or moneyrelated dispute involving a gun he 
says 
400 driving through brooklyns prospect park we spot a red 
lump in the grass we find a man in a brand new sleeping bag who is 
not asleep my wife threw me out he says isnt he worried 
about the zodiac i dont care im a virgo he replies we 
return to the car discuss his appearance and his admission of his 
birth sign and decide hes a decoy cop 
520 bedfordstuyvesant we hear a suspect is at the 79th 
precinct station house but it turns out the police brought in a 
zodiacsketch lookalike questioned him for 10 minutes and let him 
go

people who live downwind from the hanford 
nuclear reservation reacted with anger and relief thursday about 
the governments disclosure that enough radiation spewed from the 
base to cause cancer 
i feel like they used us for guinea pigs and i dont feel 
like they cared one iota what happened to us either or our 
families said betty perkes a farmer in pasco which is next to 
the 560squaremile reservation 
an independent panel of scientists released preliminary data 
thursday that showed some residents in the early years of 
atomicbomb building in the 1940s could have been exposed to large 
doses of radioactive iodine for a few infants the doses were as 
high as 2900 rad over three years one rad is the amount of 
radiation a body organ would absorb from about a dozen chest xrays 
terry frazee of the state health department said radiation 
standards allow a maximum of five rads a year for industrial 
workers although individual organs can handle greater amounts 
dr george laramore professor of radiological oncology at the 
university of washington school of medicine recommended that 
people who were infants in the hanford area during the period be 
checked for thyroid conditions but he added that thyroid tumors 
would likely have appeared five to 15 years after exposure 
survivors of the us atomic bombings of japan at the end of 
world war ii received thyroid doses estimated at 130 rad laramore 
said adding that some nuclear medicine treatments use doses as 
high as 800 rads 
the preliminary study results came a day after energy secretary 
james watkins admitted past hanford emissions may have caused 
health problems 
john till a south carolina consultant who chaired the 18member 
panel of scientists and experts cautioned that the figures were 
not meant as health risk estimates 
but till added these numbers are significant because that is 
a lot of folks that dose level is significant enough to strongly 
justify a thyroid dose study 
a parallel study by the federal centers for disease control will 
use the exposure estimates to try to document cases of thyroid 
disease among hanfordarea residents 
the hanford environmental dose reconstruction project concluded 
that most people living near the hanford site from 1944 to 1947 
were exposed to low doses of radiation the study covered 270000 
people living in 10 washington and oregon counties 
but up to 13500 people may have received doses of more than 33 
rad of radioactive iodine from the milk they drank 
about 1400 infants and children living in the area received 15 
to 650 rad till said including a small number of infants who may 
have received doses of 2900 rad or more 
the radioactive iodine was produced when spent reactor fuel rods 
were chemically dissolved to produce weaponsgrade plutonium and 
uranium when it concentrates in the thyroid gland iodine131 can 
cause cancer and other diseases 
till said that by comparison doses downwind from the nevada 
nuclear weapons testing site ranged from a few rad to 500 rad 
i know of no other releases of this magnitude from any other 
us facility till said of the 194447 period noting that 
modern releases are extremely small 
downwinders people living directly east of the installation 
during the years of heaviest releases of radioactive iodine called 
a news conference after the report was released to express 
confidence in the technical steering panels work and anger at the 
governments long record of secrecy 
we really believe were getting the truth now said tom 
bailie a mesa farmer whose familys history of cancers and other 
medical problems have been extensively chronicled in news reports 
about the downwinders 
although the government cannot be sued under the doctrine of 
sovereign immunity bailie said compensation could be sought 
through congress similar to that recently given to uranium miners 
for radiationrelated illnesses 
the federal government owes something if folks have been 
harmed by these early releases of radiation rep sid morrison 
rwash whose district includes the reservation said in 
washington dc while these estimates are preliminary and they 
will change the potential for harmful side effects is with us to 
stay 
at the downwinder news conference residents gave a litany of 
family health problems including thyroid dysfunctions and cancers 
that they attributed to the radiation releases 
for a lot of years i have been hunting every scrap of 
newspaper i could find to see why this is happening said mary 
pengelly who lives in kirkland and was raised near pendleton ore 
it makes me feel that maybe were going to see some answers 
the technical steering panel was appointed in 1988 after health 
concerns were raised by the release in february 1986 of 19000 
pages of previously classified hanford environmental documents 
the phased fiveyear 15 million study is intended to create 
computer models of possible radiation doses to nearby residents 
the first phase studied airborne radioactive iodine emissions 
during from 194447 and radioactive cooling water poured into the 
columbia river from 196467 
because of prevailing westtoeast winds the affected area lies 
roughly east of hanford with larger radiation doses affecting 
those who lived closest to the reservation till said 
most at risk were infants near hanfords eastern border who 
drank a lot of milk from family owned cows till said 
on wednesday watkins told reports in washington dc that the 
implications of the report were serious 
it was the governments first admission that the leaks were at 
levels sufficient to cause cancer and other illnesses in people 
living near hanford 
i dont want you to think we do this today watkins said 
but we do have to go back and look at what happened to people 
the inchthick preliminary report contains hundreds of pages of 
tables listing dose pathways in each us census area among the 
10 counties the counties are benton franklin walla walla 
adams grant kittitas yakima and klickitat in washington and 
oregons morrow and umatilla

the head of a teenage girl was found in a 
freezer and she probably was killed and dismembered as part of a 
satanic ritual according to police who arrested two people in the 
case 
a saginaw man and a juvenile were arrested wednesday after two 
women found the head in a freezer of a house in this town 15 miles 
north of detroit and took it to police said deputy police chief 
carl muschong 
the head had been cleaned of skin and hair he said 
jaime rodriguez jr 21 was arraigned thursday on charges of 
firstdegree murder conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder and 
mutilation of a human body said warren police sgt robert ahrens 
a hearing was adjourned thursday for a 15yearold saginaw boy 
who was apparently staying at the warren home where the body was 
found ahrens said 
he was being held at a youth home until a hearing set for 
tuesday he said police said he was expected to be charged with 
similar offenses 
murder and conspiracy are both punishable by life in prison and 
mutilation is a 10yearfelony 
saginaw police said rodriguez also was wanted on robbery 
kidnapping extortion auto theft and weapons charges 
police found body parts wrapped in garbage bags buried in the 
houses back yard and hidden in a black car in the garage muschong 
said the car had been reported stolen earlier in saginaw he said 
several books and cassettes about witchcraft were found in the 
basement leading police to believe that the girl was the victim of 
an occult ritual muschong said 
neighbors said there had been trouble at the house for more than 
two years some said fighting in the streets and parties that 
lasted through the night were common and police were called often 
it really is a creepy feeling said berta lapointe who 
lives three doors away from the house and watched the police carry 
bags of body parts out of the back yard 
police commissioner paul pash said no illegal activity was 
uncovered at the house during previous calls 
well try to interview anybody that has had contact with that 
house and well check missing persons from that area muschong 
said well have a description when we get it all to the medical 
examiner and he can put it all together 
police believe the victim is a 15yearold reported missing june 
26 ahrens said he said a positive identification had yet to be 
made using dental records but were pretty confident that its 
her 
an autopsy determined the girl died recently

a house democrat suggested thursday that a 
10000 donation to the republicans by a business partner of 
president bushs son could have been aimed at blocking an 
investigation concerning a colorado savings and loan association 
the partner dismissed the allegation as total unadulterated 
nonsense and the no 2 house republican said a separate 
democratic move toward requesting a special prosecutor for the 
sampls collapse had the stench of corruption and hypocrisy 
in a day of charges and countercharges concerning the 
institution where neil bush was a director rep frank annunzio of 
illinois suggested developer kenneth m goods 10000 contribution 
to the republican national committee on nov 2 1988 could have 
been a donation of hush money 
annunzio who has accused the bush administration of not 
prosecuting savings and loan fraud vigorously didnt provide 
specific evidence to back up his allegations 
meanwhile action as well as talk was escalating in congress on 
the explosive sampl issue and neil bushs role in the collapse of 
silverado banking savings and loan association bush 34 was a 
director of the denver thrift which failed at a cost to taxpayers 
of 1 billion 
democrats on the house judiciary committee are moving to ask 
attorney general dick thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel 
to investigate silverados collapse rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo said thursday 
the case has criminal implications that should be aggressively 
investigated said a letter that had been signed by 11 of the 
committees democrats by thursday night 
the law requires the signature of at least 12 democrats a 
majority of the 21 on the committee to make the request 
the letter sparked an outraged reaction from no 2 house 
republican newt gingrich dga who criticized congressional 
democrats for seeking to investigate the presidents son while 
trying to block past probes of democrats accused of wrongdoing 
republicans have said democrats are trying to use the neil bush 
case as a way of attacking his father 
the democrats letter to thornburgh said that because neil bush 
and several other people with political connections were associated 
with the bank it would be a conflict of interest for the justice 
department itself to conduct the investigation of silverado 
thornburgh in a news conference wednesday said i am not a 
great fan of independent counsels as you know but we know our 
obligations under the law and will execute them 
a spokesman said that if legislators formally requested a 
special prosecutor he would review the request and respond within 
30 days 
good in a statement issued by his attorney said my 
contribution to the republican party in 1988 was two years after my 
relationship with silverado was terminated through a negotiated 
settlement 
with no evidence whatsoever mr annunzio has accused a 
private citizen of criminal activity he is spreading vicious 
false accusations in the public arena without any basis no 
government agency at any level has accused me of any wrongdoing 
good said 
good donated more than 90000 to republican candidates in the 
198788 period including 5750 for george bushs presidential 
bid the federal election commission said some 85000 to 
candidates other than bush was given in november 1988 just before 
the elections 
the developer who also invested over 3 million in neil bushs 
oil exploration company was the fifthlargest individual political 
contributor in colorado in 1988 according to a study by the center 
for responsive politics 
his contributions included 750 in august 1986 and 5000 in 
october 1987 for the bush presidential campaign said scott moxley 
a spokesman for the federal election commission 
the developer also contributed to the campaigns of several 
democrats including sen robert kerrey of nebraska 500 sen 
timothy e wirth of colorado 2000 and sen george j mitchell 
of maine 500 according to the federal election commission 
during neil bushs tenure on its board silverado loaned good 
around 30 million that was never repaid federal regulators have 
ordered the presidents son to answer allegations of conflict of 
interest in his role as a director of the thrift 
among accusations the regulators allege that he failed to 
adequately disclose his ties to good bush has denied any 
wrongdoing and the president has defended the honor and 
integrity of his son at news conferences 
annunzio said goods donation to the republicans made shortly 
before the election that brought george bush to the white house 
could have been aimed at blocking a justice department 
investigation of good as a silverado borrower 
annunzio said officials of the office of thrift supervision made 
five criminal referrals concerning silverado to the justice 
department but the thrift office has refused to give him the names 
or dates of those referrals 
he speculated that one of the referrals could have involved 
good and that the information is not being made public because the 
referrals could have been made at around the same time good 
contributed the 10000 
annunzio sent a letter thursday to thornburgh requesting copies 
of the five silverado referrals 
justice department spokesman doug tillett said thursday the 
names of any people who might be involved wouldnt be made public 
since they would be part of a pending investigation he wouldnt 
confirm whether silverado referrals had been made to the department 
neil bushs attorney james nesland said his client would have 
no comment 
good recently told a house banking committee hearing on 
silverado that his net worth has plummeted from 100 million to 
less than zero 
campaign finance records show that good donated 42500 to 
republican candidates in colorado and an equal amount to 
republicans in california both in early november of 1988

lockheed corp delivered the 59th and 
last f117a stealth fighter to the air force on thursday in a 
wellpublicized ceremony that contrasted sharply with the secrecy 
that veiled the jet for a decade 
delivery from lockheeds famed supersecret skunk works division 
comes as the defense firm girds for heated competition with 
northrop corp to build the advanced tactical fighter for the air 
force of the next century 
the atf contract for hundreds of warplanes is the last big 
ticket item on the pentagon shopping list for the end of the 20th 
century and represents the major spoils of what is left in the 
rapidly shrinking us defense budget 
gen michael j dugan the new air force chief of staff 
described the f117a as an example of a small is beautiful 
philosophy promoted by skunk works founder kelly johnson and noted 
that the program finished within budget and ahead of schedule 
we are going to be a smaller air force dugan said we are 
going to be a little smaller and little smarter small can be 
beautiful 
still at a cost of 426 million a plane the f117a remains 
one of the most expensive fighter aircraft ever built part of the 
cost resides in program secrecy imposed in 1981 
the project was accomplished with the strictest security 
measures known since the manhattan project to build the atom bomb 
during world war ii former defense secretary frank carlucci has 
said 
what the air force got for its money is a force of a little more 
than 50 planes the black sharply angled jet is actually a ground 
attack aircraft able to sneak past radar while dropping bombs with 
pinpoint accuracy 
the last delivery was announced in big newspaper advertisements 
which have become common in the aerospace industry since the 
defense budget began shrinking and firms and the services have 
become eager to show off advanced operational hardware that once 
was secret 
about 500 people attended the ceremony at lockheeds palmdale 
plant 
a northropled team has already rolled out its atf prototype but 
lockheeds prototype is not expected until late summer 
both northrop and lockheed are laying off many workers in 
southern california 
for lockheeds part the company hopes its breakthrough in 
stealth technology will help in the winnertakeall contract to 
build the atf 
the stealth fighter was built at the topsecret skunk works that 
developed such other hightechnology aircraft as the u2 and the 
mach 3 sr71 blackbird spyplanes 
let the nation know we are ready to do it again said skunk 
works chief ben rich 
if lockheed gets the atf contract the calabasas califbased 
contractor said it would build the fighters for the 63 billion 
program in georgia 
northrop would build atf planes in california at palmdale

the house passed landmark legislation on 
thursday guaranteeing rights to millions of disabled americans 
including access to public transportation businesses and jobs 
approval of the americans with disabilities act by a 37728 
vote came after house and senate negotiators agreed on a way to 
protect the jobs of aidsinfected workers who handle food 
rep william e dannemeyer rcalif and others tried 
unsuccessfully to restore an amendment that would have let 
employers keep aidsinfected workers away from foodhandling duties 
the senate will vote on the bill friday morning said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
president bush has urged passage of the bill one of the most 
significant pieces of domestic legislation of his term the bill 
has been hailed as the most significant civil rights legislation 
since the 1964 act prohibiting racial discrimination 
it is indeed a bill which will open up america to 43 million 
americans who have been shut out sometimes consciously but too 
often subconsciously said the chief house sponsor rep steny 
hoyer dmd 
among the measures key provisions 
restaurants stores professional offices and all other 
businesses must make their services available to people with 
disabilities provided the cost of doing so is not excessive the 
requirement takes effect 18 months after enactment except for 
small businesses which would have longer 
businesses with 15 or more employees must disregard handicaps 
in hiring decisions and make special accommodations at the 
employers cost for those disabilities the accommodation is 
limited by the financial hardship it will cause for the company 
the requirement will be phased in over four years 
amtrak commuter rail systems and local and intercity bus 
systems will have to provide areas for disabled passengers 
including those in wheelchairs 
all telephone companies will have to provide special services 
for people with speech and hearing impairments 
opponents of the bill such as rep dan burton rind 
complain the bill is vaguely worded and will create a firestorm 
of lawsuits at the expense of the economy 
the bill caps two years of efforts including negotiations last 
summer with the white house 
the senate passed the bill last september by a 768 vote the 
house passed its version of the bill in may by a 40320 vote 
the house however added an amendment to let employers reassign 
workers with aids so they couldnt come into contact with food an 
attempt to resurrect that amendment failed thursday night by a 
224180 vote 
under a compromise approved earlier thursday by house and senate 
negotiators the department of health and human services would be 
required each year to study all communicable diseases and how they 
are transmitted the house vote on the bill approves that 
compromise which originated wednesday in the senate 
under the compromise employers in the food industry would be 
able to reassign workers whose diseases may be spread to customers 
through contact with food 
the compromise effectively negates the earlier house amendment 
health and human services secretary louis w sullivan and other 
leading health officials have repeatedly stated the disease cannot 
be spread through such casual contact 
proponents of the house amendment included sen jesse helms 
rnc who unsuccessfully sought to have the senate adopt it 
helms and others said public fears about aids could drive 
restaurants out of business despite scientific evidence

former gov evan mecham can run for office again 
despite his 1988 impeachment and ouster from office the arizona 
supreme court ruled thursday 
impeachment essentially a political process is not subject 
to judicial review the states highest court said in a unanimous 
decision any appeal from the impeachment conviction lies in the 
electoral process 
a former highway patrolman dennis ingram challenged mechams 
reelection bid saying the arizona constitution automatically 
barred him from running again 
the justices decided 50 that the state constitution was 
unclear on that point and that election the ultimate weapon of 
democracy is favored where any doubt exists 
mecham was convicted of misuse of about 80000 given him by 
supporters and obstruction of justice in a coverup of an alleged 
death threat made by an aide 
as expected the court made the only decision that we could 
see that they could make mecham said at a campaign stop in yuma 
we appreciate that and now lets get on with the election and let 
the people do the choosing of who their next governors going to be 
and get on with solving the critical problems of the state 
mecham filed as a gubernatorial candidate last month for the 
sept 11 republican primary he faces four primary opponents 
with incumbent gov rose mofford stepping down the 
gubernatorial race is wide open former phoenix mayor terry goddard 
is considered the democratic frontrunner 
ingram contended mechams impeachment and conviction 
automatically barred mecham from ever again seeking office 
im disappointed obviously said michael meehan ingrams 
lawyer 
mecham argued the state constitution does not automatically ban 
him from seeking public office and the state senate rejected such a 
ban 
the senate convicted mecham by a twothirds vote but came up 
three votes short of a twothirds majority when it considered a 
dracula clause which would have banned him from holding public 
office 
mecham and arizona attorney general bob corbin said 
disqualification from holding office is discretionary and the only 
thing the constitution required was removal from office 
ingram has declined to discuss his motivation for filing the 
challenge to mechams comeback attempt 
mecham has said he believes one of his political opponents was 
behind ingrams challenge but meehan denied that

thirtynine haitians drowned when their 
sailboat capsized in choppy seas in the bahamas while being towed 
by a military patrol boat according to a government statement 
thursday 
sixtyseven others aboard the unnamed 45foot sailing sloop were 
rescued after it sank tuesday afternoon the bahamian government 
said 
the government did not explain what caused the sloop to sink 
while under tow 
the bahamian defence force vessel hmbs yellow elder under the 
command of lt cmdr godfrey rolle spotted the haitian vessel at 
1130 am tuesday off staniel cay about 200 miles southeast of 
the southern tip of florida near great exuma island 
the sloop tried to enter shallow waters and the patrol boat 
pursued catching up to the vessel and taking it under tow 
according to the statement during the tow back to staniel cay the 
sloop capsized 
one haitian radio station reported that the tow line broke 
while another said that panicked haitians ran to one side of the 
vessel when bahamian soldiers boarded the vessel 
the bodies of the 30 men and nine women were buried wednesday at 
bitter guana cay in the exumas about 80 miles from nassau the 
statement said 
defence forces officials thursday night did not return calls 
from the associated press 
a fishing guide walter robinson said the bodies of the 
haitians were placed on a raft covered with a canvas and brought 
into black point on the great guana cay 
he said he helped a police boat tow the raft with his skiff 
navigating between shallow flats and rocky heads 
robinson said he arrived at 2 am wednesday after being called 
to the scene to help move the bodies 
there was nobody to take charge of the bodies i put the raft 
into the beach took a grapple overboard and pulled it up on the 
island and tied it to the beach and left them there robinson 
said 
the surviving haitians were brought to nassau on wednesday

prosandinista workers jumped for joy 
and began returning to their jobs thursday after the usbacked 
government gave in to strike demands in order to settle a 
destructive work stoppage 
former president daniel ortega called the settlement a victory 
for the sandinistas that preserved a basic conquest of the 
revolution land reform 
a sandinista strike in may ended with a 100 percent pay raise 
businesses opened thursday in managua and workers began to 
replace street paving stones torn up to build barricades 
six people were killed and 100 wounded in clashes between 
strikers and government supporters during the 10day strike that 
tested the stability of president violeta barrios de chamorro and 
her government which replaced ortegas government on april 25 
the government met many sandinista demands salary increases 
compensation for fired government workers suspension of a decree 
to return sandinistaconfiscated land to its original owners and 
restoration of free public transportation for students 
unions also appeared to have made headway in their demand for a 
role in running the economy in this country of 37 million 
residents 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said the administration was pleased the strikes had ended 
but he assailed sandinista authorities saying they have been 
unwilling to grant the government the breathing spell it needs to 
get desperately needed economic reconstruction under way 
ortega denied the strike was a sandinista attempt to undermine 
the government and said senior party leaders played a pivotal role 
in settling it 
he praised the sandinista armed forces which his brother heads 
and the sandinista police for avoiding confrontation 
the superior council of private enterprise the major business 
group here said the strike amounted to blackmail and accused the 
government of caving in under pressure council president gilberto 
cuadra said the accord crippled the government program to return 
nicaragua to a free market economy 
the strike hit at planting time and involved thousands of 
agricultural workers cuadra said it will cost nicaragua from 35 
million to 50 million 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo defended the settlement on 
state radio he said it prevented more bloodshed and assured 
stability 
employees at the industry and commerce ministry jumped up and 
down and hugged each other in celebration when the end of the 
strike was announced 
the strike began july 2 and grew into the biggest challenge to 
mrs chamorro since the sandinistas were voted out of office 10 
weeks ago after nine years in power the sandinistas had said since 
losing elections to her united national opposition coalition that 
they would rule from below 
unions claimed 90000 government and state industry employees 
joined the walkout it was the second time the sandinistas brought 
public services to a halt to force pay raises and modifications in 
mrs chamorros plans to cut public spending sell off stateowned 
enterprises and turn into a capitalist economy the 
socialistoriented economy built by the sandinistas 
traffic stareted returning to normal thursday but cars and 
trucks had to creep around potholes dislodged paving stones and 
rubble left behind from the barricades and fires that filled the 
streets during three days of disturbances 
the unions called off street disruptions wednesday to persuade 
the government to negotiate but intense gunfire could be heard in 
the city through the night no casualties were reported 
army and city cleanup crews used heavy equipment to shovel away 
remaining barricades others fit paving stones back into place 
the government had declared the strike illegal illegitimate 
and nonexistent and threatened to fire those who took part most 
government employees received their positions during sandinista 
rule 
the agreement with the prosandinista national workers front 
grants a 43 percent raise this month and another increase in 
august the amount of the second raise is to be later determined 
the agreement specifies that 800 employees fired after april 26 
will receive compensation state jobs will be reclassified in 
september and a new minimum wage law will be established 
the strikers forced the conservative government to back down on 
a key part of its plan to return nicaragua debilitated by the 
reagan administrations economic embargo to a freemarket economy 
the return of lands confiscated in the 1979 revolution 
workers and students are to once again ride public 
transportation for free a privilege granted by the sandinistas and 
recently suspended by the new government to save money 
the government agreed to create a commission of government and 
national workers front representatives to discuss government 
investment in stateowned texile metalworking and construction 
companies the talks are to begin monday 
creation of the commission appeared to be a response to the 
fronts demand for a role in making economic policy

four performance artists denied grants by the 
national endowment for the arts plan to appeal 
i refuse to accept the overturning of my grant and those of 
the three other artists holly hughes said wednesday at a news 
conference called by the national campaign for freedom of 
expression 
the nea vetoed funds june 29 for hughes and fellow artists karen 
finley tim miller and john fleck despite a recommendation by an 
endownment peer panel that they be given money grants totaling 
104000 were awarded to 14 other artists 
the endowment has come under attack from rightwing critics and 
some religious groups who contend public money should not be given 
to art that might be considered obscene the work of all four 
artists three of whom are openly homosexual contains explicit 
sexual references and in some cases nudity 
our work is not as the religious right charges 
pornographic hughes said if any of these artists were doing 
pornographic work we wouldnt bother applying to the nea we would 
be making plenty of money already 
the process of appealing the nea decision has not yet been 
worked out but the idea has received strong support from the solo 
performance fellowship panel which initially recommended that the 
grants be given to the four artists 
we believe that each of these individual artists based on the 
criteria that was before us is deserving of the fellowship as 
recommended said philip arnoult panel chairman and director of 
the theater project in baltimore 
in an emotional statement finley said i am being punished 
because i am a morally concerned artist this is a sad 
regressive time in our national history as the wall in eastern 
europe is coming down it seems that a new wall in our own country 
is going up 
but she cautioned against abolishing the nea and relying solely 
on private business to underwrite the arts 
corporations use the nea as a guideline in knowing who to give 
money to by knowing who has gone through the distinguished process 
of the endowments granting procedures she said most private 
funds and foundations do the same 
richard elovich a performance artist whose grant was approved 
this year by the endowment called on artists and organizations 
given government funds to use a part of that money to support 
artists and arts organizations blacklisted by the nea 
in denver wednesday a group of artists attending the 
composertocomposer international telluride institute conference 
including pulitzer prize winner roger reynolds denounced the neas 
rejection of the four saying it was part of a disturbing trend 
toward censorship 
we really believe these artists have a right to express 
themselves said laurie anderson a performance artist these 
artists in my opinion were sacrificed to the socalled greater 
good 
the national campaign for freedom of expression based in 
washington was created earlier this year by arts activists it has 
called for the fiveyear reauthorization of the national endownment 
for the arts without restrictions or restructuring

and loan industry would face an expanded army of investigators and 
longer prison terms under major crime legislation approved by the 
senate

lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis sen 
patrick leahy dvt said wednesday as the crime bill was approved 
946 and sent to the house 
the savings and loan provisions came as a lastminute addition 
to the crime package which also would place curbs on nine kinds of 
semiautomatic assault weapons and make 34 federal offenses 
punishable by death

aid prosecutors put pressure on the bush administration to clean up

travel is hell 
an airport traffic jam delivers you to an endless line with 
luggage to lug to your narrow airplane seat for a meal of cute toy 
food a pressurized atmosphere and a bouncy landing worse to come 
back you reverse the procedure international travel can be 
unshirted hell exposing the unwary traveler to bad food bad 
service and bad company in a foreign language and an eccentric 
currency um how many shinplasters for that there fried zobrovny 
pardner 
great journeys an eightpart series bowing saturday night 
on pbs is another powerful incentive to stay home it reminds you 
just how miserable travel can be or how much fun if youre a 
masochist 
i love to travel you say 
and then you tell the whole story of your 13hour layover at 
krazed dictator international on the equator where sullen customs 
men teased sunburned sweaty germans in counterfeit chanel tshirts 
and you saw babies get sucked dry by malarial mosquitoes the size 
of dinner plates 
great journeys promises more of that kind of fun its first 
episode the silk road takes you through western china and some 
of the most desolate landscape ever seen outside a kitty box 
the publicity for great journeys says it will travel the 
worlds great trade routes with writers who make making personal 
journeys of passion along routes that hold personal significance 
for each of them hmm 
the opening episode takes colin thubron a wellregarded british 
novelist and travel writer along the silk traders caravan route 
from the great wall of china to well china he almost gets to 
afghanistan 
the lust for silk he explains nearly bankrupted the roman 
empire when travelers brought the fine fabric back from the orient 
the overland route flourished but has been in decline for oh 600 
years or so 
for thubron who chronicled a 10000mile road trip in his 1987 
book where nights are longest travels by car through western 
russia it must seem like a pleasant outing it exhausts even an 
armchair traveler 
along the way we see the waning influence of chinese culture 
it is gradually supplanted by the moslem people known as the 
turcomen farmers and traders whose culture is distinctly middle 
eastern and nonchinese 
theyre a handsome courteous people and they treat thubron with 
great restraint especially when he asks dumb questions q would 
you like to live in the city a certainly why not 
it turns out this journey has personal significance for thubron 
because he always wanted to do it judging from the landscape and 
his fellow travelers he is alone in that regard nobody but 
thubron is out there for recreation 
remember were talking trade route not scenic or 
fun route the terrain is flat and monotonous or hummocked and 
monotonous or mountainous and ugly a road runs through it he 
travels mostly by bus he loves it 
the silk traders skirted the great deserts not thubron he 
hires a couple of spitting toestomping camels and takes a daytrip 
onto the sand he loves it heck he even loves the camels who 
care for nothing but other camels 
he characterizes his journey as a solitary one this was 
probably a comfort to the invisible cameraman and sound operator 
who filmed his departing bus or arriving truck or his camel caravan 
endlessly rolling across the horizon 
mostly though thubron meditates on what it feels like to be in 
the last place god made 
other episodes of great journeys are much more promising 
than the silk road the burma road the salt road of the 
sahara the pan american highway and the ho chi minh trail will be 
featured in coming weeks 
and you dont have to leave home to see them

if the usual measurements indicate stocks are 
priced rather high and the profit outlook is uninspiring and the 
economy seems to be going nowhere fast shouldnt the market 
averages fall 
if you think so you have lots of company among professional 
analysts some of whom have been saying for a year that the 
markets pricetoequity and pricetoearnings and 
pricetoprospects ratios are too high 
but the market never does what it should do the very word 
has no meaning whatsoever in regard to stock prices except to offer 
alibis to those who have been wrong or who wish to parade their 
academic knowledge 
that said why should the market ride higher on a weaker 
substructure than it has in the past or why shouldnt the popular 
bluechip averages revert to their proper behavior 
here are a few possibilities gleaned from analyst comments 
the institutionalization of the marketplace pension funds 
continue to grow their investment commitments are dictated not 
only by their analyses of stocks but by the need to put the money 
to use 
in a sense they must invest because of the large size of their 
transactions they must buy stocks in companies that also are large 
and have enough shares outstanding to accommodate largescale 
buying and selling 
when the market was made up of small traders there was more 
variability in their choices but individual investors continue to 
leave the market in the first quarter they reduced equity 
holdings at an annual rate of 91 billion 
the popular averages reflect prices of the biggest stocks and 
the activities of the biggest investors not all stocks are doing 
as well as the blue chips smaller stocks have been laggards for 
several years 
more big buyers are indexing their portfolios that is they 
seek to at least match the popular indexes most of which are 
bluechip indicators and they do so by buying the very stocks 
that make up the indexes 
the supply of equities is shrinking but the number of equity 
seekers may not be shrinking there are fewer stocks to buy today 
than there were last year or five years ago or seven years ago 
since 1983 according to wright investors service which 
closely monitors the equities population more than 500 billion of 
us equities have been removed from the stock market 
the shrinkage continued in the first quarter of 1990 according 
to wright which estimates that the value of equities retired 
exceeded the value of new issues by an annual rate of 63 billion 
in the 1980s most of the shrinkage resulted from corporate 
takeovers many of which substituted debt for equity more 
recently the decline seems to be resulting more from corporations 
buying back their own shares 
in late 1989 and early this year for example general electric 
ibm and westinghouse announced major stock repurchase programs that 
will total about 16 billion over the next several years 
what should the market be doing nothing but what it is 
doing

congressional candidate rosa delauro wants to 
use a big chunk of the peace dividend to help defense workers and 
industries adapt to the end of the cold war 
its a winwin proposal in her connecticut district which is 
dominated by three major military contractors already feeling the 
effects of friendlier relations around the world 
theres only one catch there might not be a peace dividend 
the cold war thaw is expected to produce military spending cuts 
adding up to tens of billions of dollars over the next few years 
but even as candidates tout their big plans for that money some 
politicians and analysts maintain the peace dividend is only a 
mirage 
the savings and loan bailout will eat it up rep dan 
rostenkowski of illinois told the nations mayors last month 
efforts to cut the federal deficit will swallow it others say 
any politician in an election year is going to grab for any 
available resource and spend it on the trail because they dont 
have anything else to spend said democratic analyst bob beckel 
but the pressure to take peace dividend money and use it for 
anything but deficit reduction is just too strong right now and 
this is coming from a liberal he added with a laugh 
the same argument is coming from republicans and fiscally 
conservative democrats like rostenkowski many of them contend that 
any peace dividend is too far down the road to mean much to voters 
anyway 
people cant relate to the argument said linda divall a 
gop polling consultant there is no 150 million surplus there on 
the table if it existed republicans and democrats would not be 
sitting down to talk about deficit reduction the peace dividend 
was peace 
such talk aside the peace dividend continues to crop up on 
campaign trails in places like connecticut iowa colorado and 
nebraska 
josie heath a democratic senate candidate in colorado visited 
with coal miners coming off the morning shift one day last week 
i was telling them id like to cut the defense budget by 50 
percent and they were shaking their heads and saying its about 
time heath said 
she and delauro who is seeking the democratic nomination for an 
open house seat are suggesting similar peace dividend plans that 
would divide military savings between deficit reduction and 
domestic needs such as education health care housing subsidies 
pollution cleanup road and bridge repair and aid to 
defensedependent states and communities 
neither candidate believes peace dividend savings automatically 
must go to the sampl bailout 
i dont think we need to accept rostenkowskis dictum on 
that said delauro we have to decide what it is we want to do 
what are the priorities we want to focus on 
the delauro and heath plans are similar to proposals being 
offered by more than a few democrats eager to highlight their 
partys reputation for caring about domestic concerns 
celinda lake a democratic pollster said it is a useful 
political exercise even if theres no pot of gold at the end of the 
rainbow 
the peace dividend is just becoming a metaphor for talking 
about priorities in spending she said its one of the few 
areas where democrats still have an advantage 
several influential democrats including house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo believe the party can build on its 
strengths by becoming identified as the champion of displaced 
defense workers 
this economic conversion theme evolving in legislation and 
campaign pitches like those of heath and delauro involves a range 
of proposals to retool factories redirect research and retrain 
workers while cushioning economic shocks 
the policy holds obious appeal for defensedependent regions of 
new england virginia california texas colorado and new york 
and democrats believe their candidates stand to benefit most 
people believe democrats would cut the military more than 
republicans but they also know its darn hard to change a 
50yearold tank welder into a toxic waste specialist said lake 
they believe it takes resources and if youre looking for 
resources youre looking for democrats 
but beckel cautions there are potential pitfalls to the 
strategy as well 
theres an advantage you force the debate he said but i 
worry about raising expectations and then not being able to deliver 
on them

with the us newspaper empire he built on junk 
bonds and panache crumbling its not surprising that ralph m 
ingersoll ii has retreated to europe to pick up the pieces 
ingersoll whose network of newspaper holdings grew fast the 
past five years and shrank even faster earlier this month always 
considered himself an odd duck among american newspaper publishers 
hes been described as worldly softspoken debonair 
continental and global some acquaintances just call the 
44yearold entrepreneur a european kind of guy 
he speaks several languages went to school in switzerland 
wears english suits married a german drives a german car and when 
he dashes off a note he dates it the european way 2 july 1990 
that date july 2 was a turning point in the rise and fall of 
the media company started by ingersolls father ralph senior a 
respected editor who got into publishing in the late 1950s 
ingersoll announced a transatlantic swap with investment 
partner em warburg pincus amp co he gave up all his american 
newspapers and became sole owner of his european newspaper group 
ingersoll had controlled 10 american dailies and dozens of weeklies 
the swap also left ingersoll with a much smaller lessindebted 
business that includes a morning afternoon and sunday newspaper in 
dublin ireland and three dailies and 39 weeklies in england 
ingersoll said hes happy with the deal 
i think it was natural and basically inevitable ingersoll 
said in a telephone interview from the south of france where he was 
visiting friends we had a philosophical difference i saw great 
opportunity in europe they werent really interested 
he said the key to the deal for him is that hes severing his 
ties with warburg pincus his investment partner since 1983 
under his original agreement with that firm ingersoll was 
obligated to share 50 percent of the profits of any acquisition or 
deal he made after several years he realized he had made a 
mistake especially when he learned that warburg pincus wasnt 
particularly enthusiastic about european expansion 
i was faced with an opportunity to get out from under that 
agreement and i took advantage of it ingersoll said now im 
free to negotiate with individual investor groups for each 
individual deal thats the way my father and i did it for 25 years 
and thats the way im going to do it now 
nonetheless a basic question still emerges how much choice did 
he have in whats happened to him 
whats happening i think was basically forced upon him 
said john morton a media industry analyst for lynch jones amp ryan 
in new york but i guess with his affinity for europe it might 
make it easier to swallow 
others say ingersoll welcomes the chance to escape the recession 
that has hurt the american newspaper industry ingersoll said he 
talked with his partners about the transatlantic swap last year 
and has been watching the european market for eight years 
ralph always said there were greater opportunities in europe 
he always expressed a strong interest over there i think this move 
is consistent with his thinking said tom tallarico expublisher 
of ingersolls exnewspaper the st louis sun 
the sun launched last september was supposed to be a 
revolutionary tabloid designed to show that growth was possible in 
a stagnant industry 
after seven months the newspaper folded with a loss of at least 
25 million ingersoll who used some of his own money to start the 
paper said he stopped publishing because of inadequate street 
sales 
analysts said he was forced to pull the plug because of his 
weighty obligations in junk bonds the highyield highrisk debt 
securities that became a primary financing tool for many companies 
in the 1980s 
by some reckonings ingersolls us newspaper network amassed 
debts exceeding 700 million much of it raised by michael milken 
the junkbond financier of the nowdefunct drexel burnham lambert 
inc investment company 
a month before the suns demise ingersoll offered to repurchase 
240 million worth of junk bonds at deep discounts to avoid 
defaulting on upcoming interest payments he got a poor response 
everyone in the industry said the st louis sun was illfated 
from the start said kenneth berents a stock analyst with alex 
brown amp co in baltimore and its interesting that had he not 
gone out on a limb for the sun he might not be having the problems 
hes having today the sun may have cost him his whole empire 
ingersoll said the junk bond troubles had nothing to do with his 
decision to make the transatlantic swap and hes not sure where 
the startup of the sun fits into the picture 
it didnt figure in it directly but i suppose it may have had 
some type of metaphysical impact on what warburg pincus was 
thinking but its hard to say ingersoll said 
its difficult to say much about the internal finances of 
ingersolls companies because they are privately owned even 
bondholders have a hard time obtaining information about them 
but its clear that things havent been easy for ingersoll since 
the sun stopped publishing april 25 
i think the failure of the sun affected him more than anyone 
thought it disenchanted him with american newspapers said kevin 
horrigan the suns lead columnist who was lured away from the st 
louis postdispatch ralph felt he had something to contribute 
and was basically told no thanks 
so horrigan said hes not surprised to see ingersoll going to 
europe actually many acquaintances say theyre not surprised to 
see ingersoll going to europe because hes more attuned to that 
culture 
when newspaper analysts and other experts said that starting a 
new metropolitan newspaper couldnt de done ingersoll rattled off 
the names of several recent successful startups in europe and 
elsewhere 
at one point while his sun was struggling with sagging 
circulation and an identity problem in st louis ingersoll was in 
england having dinner with prince charles 
ingersoll hinted he hasnt given up on us newspapers 
completely the financial problems in the industry probably will 
create opportunities for newspaper entrepreneurs with a global view 
to pick up some bargains he said 
maybe in a perfect world one would operate on every 
continent ingersoll said 
for now ingersolls world is less than perfect

americas favorite car of the 1980s isnt resting on its 
laurels for the 1991 model year the ford escort is growing 
adding more hiproom and shoulder room in the rear more glass area 
up front and a new engine 
its also becoming more aerodynamic and improving its fuel 
efficiency 
nearly a decade ago americans came to know and love the 
mildmannered escort the vehicle that ford called its world 
car because it would be sold in many countries 
as the 1980s unfolded the escort subcompact was repeatedly at 
the top of the pack of favorite us nameplates by the end of the 
decade more than 346 million escorts had been sold in this 
country far outdistancing the no 2 nameplate the honda accord 
but ford motor co knew the old escort needed upgrading annual 
sales peaked at around 524500 in 1985 and the no 2 us 
automaker wanted to attract buyers of import cars to the escort 
the car was very good but it was almost a decade old said 
mike sullivan ford division marketing plans manager for the escort 
it was not quite as modern as the honda civic and toyota 
corolla the new escort is virtually all new very modern its not 
second fiddle to any car 
indeed the 1991 ford escort lx 4door hatchback test car was 
admirable in furnishing a back seat that can really be used for 
more than stowing briefcases and shopping bags though three 
goodsized adults might find it confining two adults would be in 
decent shape sullivan noted that ford added 25 inches of hiproom 
and more than 1 inch of shoulder room to the 2door escort 
i had a couple inches of clearance above my head to the roofline 
while sitting on the nicely cushioned cloth back seat and my legs 
were even extended a bit with the front seat back a bit 
with the front seats back all the way i tucked my feet under 
the front seats and my knees still werent crushed into the back of 
the front seatbacks 
in the 4door test car the rear seatback is divided and either 
side can fold down to allow room for long items in the hatchback 
the escort lx rode solidly for a little car i didnt feel 
particularly vulnerable to road bumps the powertrain has its own 
subframe to help reduce vibration and noise and new independent 
front and rear strut suspension kept the ride from being punishing 
i could hear some road noise and the 19liter sequential 
electronic fuelinjected fourcylinder engine teamed with the 
optional fourspeed automatic transmission jerked a bit a few 
times i also noticed when the air conditioner running at full 
blast tapped into the engines power 
still the engine can deliver up to 88 horsepower while 
propelling an escort thats heavier than its predecessor all 
without losing fuel economy a smoother exterior design helps too 
bringing the escorts drag coefficient which indicates the ease 
with which the car moves through the air down from 039 to 035 
of course i wasnt expecting a race car from the escort lx 
overall there was just no getting around the fact that the escort 
lx was simple decent transportation packaged in a body that was 
plainly pleasing inside and out i admired the way the car 
squeezed into awkward parking spots how easy it was to read the 
large analog gauges how comfortable it was to get used to this 
vehicle 
the average price of a 1991 escort is up about 25 percent from 
its comparably equipped predecessor but base prices ranging from 
7565 for a 2door hatchback to 11063 for an escort gt sport 
model remain within reach of many potential buyers 
ford expects escort purchasers to have a median age of 34 with 
median household income of 30000 a year about 45 percent will be 
men and at least a third of buyers will be college graduates 
sullivan said 
he added that many features such as better computerized engine 
control and tinted glass are now part of the standard escort 
vehicle 
comparisons with competitors such as the civic which starts at 
more than 6600 for a 2door hatchback with manual transmission 
and corolla which starts at more than 8700 are therefore 
difficult sullivan said 
consumer reports magazine ranked 1987 and 1988 escorts worse 
than average in owner reports of trouble but ford said the 1991 
escort will usher in a new era at ford in terms of quality 
manufacturing and design 
the company looks to sell 400000 escorts a year

world population growth and the potential 
upgrading of third world economies are cited by some economists 
when they predict a rosy future for american farmers 
more people particularly more people with money means greater 
demands on world food production goes the argument and the united 
states as the premier granary stands to gain with rising exports 
its an iffy forecast global politics and the possibility of 
massive crop failures inhibit longrange predictions 
population growth is a certainty but dont bet the old home 
place just yet that third world countries will hoist themselves out 
of economic swamps and suddenly buy everything us farmers produce 
nearly onefourth of the worlds people live in absolute 
poverty says alan b durning of the worldwatch institute and 
poverty is much more than an economic condition 
povertys horror extends to all aspects of a persons life 
susceptibility to disease limited access to most types of services 
and information lack of control over resources subordination to 
higher social and economic classes and utter insecurity in the 
face of changing circumstances durning said 
povertys psychological toll is the erosion of human dignity and 
self respect he said 
the figures describing the extent of world poverty are 
mindwarping durning writing in worldwatchs annual state of the 
world report for 1990 estimated that nearly 123 billion people 
more than 23 percent of the global population lived in poverty in 
1989 
according to worldwatch estimates the global network of 
absolute poverty included asia 675 million people 25 percent of 
the regions population subsaharan africa 325 million 62 
percent latin america 150 million 35 percent north africa and 
middle east 75 million 28 percent 
the agriculture department recently issued a report on world 
population including revisions since 1950 and projections to the 
year 2050 
authors francis urban and michael trueblood of the departments 
economic research service noted that the world population passed 5 
billion in 1987 and as of the writing in 1990 stood at 53 billion 
it is likely to pass the 10 billion mark in 2041 
but the report said there now appears to be a slowing down of 
the world population growth even though the number of people added 
annually seems large 
global population growth peaked in the mid1960s at an alltime 
high of 22 percent a year before declining gradually to the 
current rate of 17 percent 
by the year 2050 the annual rate of population growth is 
estimated to drop to about 06 percent indicating that the world 
population may stabilize at about 105 billion people toward the 
year 2100 the report said 
however while the growth rate has been declining in most 
countries and regions it is just reaching its estimated peak in 
africa and the middle east of 32 percent and 34 percent 
respectively the report said 
by the year 2050 the rate of population growth in these two 
regions probably will still be twice as high as the other regions 
of the world 
agricultural economists are more comfortable projecting a year 
or two ahead but when hardput they sometimes take a longer view 
right now the year 2000 is a favorite target for speculation 
dennis avery and glenn h sullivan of the hudson institute 
center for global food issues in indianapolis say world food 
demand will rise in the 1990s as higher incomes enable many 
countries to upgrade diets 
but avery and sullivan said in a recent report that american 
farmers may be left out of this growing overseas market unless 
there is reform of international trading rules and us farm 
policies 
negotiations aimed at reforming world trade are being conducted 
under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and congress is 
trying to hammer out a new farm bill affecting domestic programs 
at last weeks economic summit in houston leaders of the seven 
richest nations issued a final communique that finessed the thorny 
issue of eliminating agricultural subsidies as president bush 
wants the communique urges all nations to make substantial 
progressive reductions in subsidies with an eventual goal of 
eliminating them 
the averysullivan report said an 18 percent increase in world 
food production will be required in the 1990s to take care of the 
expected population growth 
in addition hundreds of millions of people in the world are 
getting higher incomes and want to upgrade their diets the 
report said 
there are probably more than 200 million middleclass food 
customers in india alone today and indias economic growth has 
recently been about three times as rapid 5 percent to 6 percent 
as her projected population growth 18 percent 
overall the report said low and middleincome countries have 
been expanding their economies by 4 percent a year more than 
double the rate of global population growth 
we expect economic growth in the 1990s to be still more rapid 
than in the debt and inflationridden 1980s the report said 
the gatt continues to offer developing countries good 
opportunities for exportled growth 
some examples of exportled growth are algeria thailand and 
mexico which the report said are now trying to emulate the export 
success of such countries as taiwan and south korea 
more and more of the world is rejecting the overdependence on 
governments which slowed economic growth in recent decades the 
report said it is happening now in the east bloc and nicaragua 
but it has been evident in china for a decade in much of latin 
america the past several years and even in large parts of africa

the dangerous legacy of 45 years of building 
atomic bombs is contaminated nuclear graveyards that will cost 
billions of dollars to clean up if indeed scientists can figure 
out a way to clean them up one researcher even says that trying to 
get rid of the radioactive wastes would cost more lives than 
leaving them alone 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
miles of 8foothigh electric fences 
stretch through bethel valley the oncesecret cradle of the atomic 
age they stand watch over burial grounds of deadly wastes that are 
the legacy of four decades of nuclear bomb production 
yellow and magenta signs proclaim radiation hazard keep 
out 
the fences encircling some of the hundreds of acres of 
contaminated land on the federal oak ridge nuclear weapons compound 
are reminders that while the cold war may be over it took a 
serious toll 
it cost about 250 billion for the roughly 65000 nuclear 
weapons that the united states has manufactured since 1945 when 
the first was assembled that bill is paid yet to be settled is 
the toll this secretive manufacturing process has taken on weapons 
workers and the environment 
at oak ridge alone the energy department has spent 1 billion 
since 1983 trying to control the environmental damage it is 
expected to take at least 10 more years just to determine what 
poisons have seeped into the soil and ground water here and 20 
more years to stop it from spreading 
the total bill for cleaning up oak ridge may top 12 billion 
costs at some of the 16 other active nuclear arms laboratories 
manufacturing plants and proving grounds in 11 other states will be 
much higher 
the full cost of environmental repairs alone may top 100 
billion estimates vary greatly because the government itself 
doesnt know how badly some sites are contaminated nor has all the 
necessary technology been developed 
the energy department which makes and tests all nuclear weapons 
for the pentagon said in a report on july 3 that the magnitude of 
the cleanup is expanding so rapidly that it cannot keep up its 
cost estimate for the next five years is 314 billion nearly 50 
percent more than it expected just one year ago and this is in the 
early days the full cleanup effort will take at least 30 years 
these amounts challenge and almost certainly exceed the 
cleanup resources available to the government and its hundreds of 
private contractors the report said 
in the meantime tennessee health authorities ban fishing and 
swimming in east fork poplar creek which winds through the 
56000acre weapons plant as well as the adjacent city of oak 
ridge and in a portion of the clinch river which borders the 
plant on three sides the stream is poisoned by mercury once used 
to separate lithium for nuclear weapons 
oak ridge originally called the clinton engineer works was the 
site of the first nuclear bomb production plants codenamed y12 
x10 and k25 today it remains a key link in the production chain 
although some of its operations have been closed permanently 
martin marietta energy systems inc which runs oak ridge under 
a government contract says 75 tons of toxic mercury and 
substantial amounts of the radioactive element cesium137 have 
spread from the weapons plant and contaminated the sediment in 
watts bar reservoir which remains open to the public for swimming 
and boating 
not only did the atomic age start here the problems did 
too says bill adams the energy departments chief of waste and 
environmental management at oak ridge 
unfortunately the problems dont end here 
the radioactive and toxic contamination is so bad at several 
nuclear weapons plants in colorado ohio tennessee south 
carolina california missouri and washington state that portions 
of these huge sites will become national sacrifice zones 
scientists say land deemed permanently unfit for human use 
we have one hell of a legacy to clean up says leo duffy 
the top adviser to energy secretary james d watkins on longterm 
environmental issues 
the legacy is not just environmental insults its damage to 
human health damage long suspected by workers and plant neighbors 
but routinely denied by the government until watkins two years ago 
began tearing down the walls of secrecy 
on july 11 more than 40 years after the fact the energy 
department acknowledged the hanford plutonium production plant in 
southcentral washington state leaked radiation at levels that 
endangered the health of nearby residents 
it was the governments first admission that the hanford leaks 
were at levels sufficient to cause cancer and other illnesses in 
people living near the facility 
the energy department is committed to cleaning up the 
environmental damage even if it has made few promises about 
addressing the problem of health risks the question is how to get 
the money needed to restore the soil and water 
congress and the bush administration are under pressure to cut 
the budget deficit even as defense spending slows in response to 
moves toward democracy in eastern europe and the soviet union 
in the emerging national debate over the size of a peace 
dividend from expected military savings and how to spend it 
little has been said about the mortgage the atomic bomb 
builders took out to compete in the arms race 
during the world war ii development of the first atomic bombs in 
the armys secret manhattan project any thoughts of environmental 
or excessive health risks were subsumed by a feeling that the very 
survival of democracy depended on getting the bomb as quickly as 
possible 
later through the cold war period military authorities used 
the shield of strict secrecy justified on national security 
grounds to continue borrowing against the environment and 
workers health to speed up bomb production according to 
interviews with current and former arms plant workers government 
officials scientists and congressional investigators 
now payment is coming due 
officials who have surveyed the dozens of existing and former 
nuclear weapons sites around the country say hundreds of billions 
of dollars are needed not only to control environmental damage but 
also to reduce the health risks of nuclear plant workers and to 
make safety improvements long put off 
until the mid1980s the government would not acknowledge these 
failures 
nobody wants to look under the rug and a lot has been swept 
under the rug in the nuclear weapons industry says elizabeth 
paul of the snake river alliance based in ketchum idaho the 
citizens group opposes the idaho national engineering laboratory 
which recovers highly enriched uranium from naval reactors 
even an investment of 100 billion in environmental corrections 
wont completely reverse the damage 
the chief problems are contamination of the soil and ground 
water on the federal sites and in surrounding areas with 
radioactive materials such as plutonium tritium and strontium90 
and such toxics as mercury arsenic and a variety of solvents

hundreds perhaps thousands of years 
therell be hot spots that will never have any other use 
except for disposal of hazardous and radioactive waste says vic 
rezendes director of energy issues at the general accounting 
office the investigative arm of congress 
the cost to human health is harder to assess 
the government has never acknowledged any human health damage 
caused by emissions from its plants or by radiation releases from 
atomic bomb tests in the desert southwest but increasing numbers 
of americans are going to court seeking compensation on grounds 
that chronic exposure to radiation caused illness and death even 
at levels the government considers safe 
bruce h deboskey a denver lawyer for some workers at the rocky 
flats plutonium processing plant says relatives of workers who 
died of cancer feel cheated by the federal government 
the widows of these workers who gave their lives to build 
these bombs are deeply embittered deboskey says theres a 
human tragedy here 
also at risk were thousands of uranium miners who dug out the 
bomb material in unventilated shafts in new mexico arizona utah 
and colorado from the late 1940s to the mid1960s when mining 
stopped because the government had stockpiled all it needed 
of the estimated 15000 men who worked the mines about 450 have 
died of lung cancer five times the number expected in a similar 
size group of american men according to the national institute of 
occupational safety and health 
congress is now trying to make some amends in june the house 
passed a bill to establish a 100 million trust to compensate 
families of miners with radiationinduced illness as well as 
certain cancer victims in nevada utah and arizona who were exposed 
to fallout from aboveground nuclear testing from 1951 to 1962 the 
senate is expected to approve the bill president bush opposes it 
scientists have not yet determined conclusively whether 
accidental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons plants 
are a health threat nor are they yet sure of the risk posed by 
chronic exposure of workers to low levels of radiation 
until the mid1980s these issues were secondary production was 
king secrecy its serf 
things having to do with atomic weapons are born secret 
says j carson mark who spent 27 years designing nuclear weapons 
at los alamos national laboratory in new mexico and is now retired 
clyde hopkins remembers the mindset in the early 1950s when he 
was a production control worker at the oak ridge y12 plant which 
used tons of mercury to separate lithium for use as a fuel source 
in thermonuclear warheads 
the pressure was intense to come up with weapons components on 
a shortterm basis he says people back in those days didnt 
even think about the environment they thought about getting the 
doggone work out to support the countrys nuclear stockpile 
i can remember days when people were walking around with lots 
of mercury on the floor you kept operating because you wanted that 
product to come out so the emphasis then was on production the 
thought that we had mercury leaking on the floor obviously working 
its way down through the concrete into the ground it wasnt 
thought about back then 
hopkins thinks about it a lot now he is president of martin 
marietta energy systems which is locked in negotiations with the 
energy department over its financial and legal liability for 
failing to meet state and federal environmental laws 
oak ridge was not alone in its approach to meeting bomb 
production schedules 
cleve anderson recalls fighting against a productionfirst 
mentality while he headed a committee studying longrange waste 
management at hanford in the late 1950s hanford was the main 
producer of plutonium the most lethal element known for use in 
nuclear bombs although today its nine reactors are shut down 
at hanford we had been indoctrinated thoroughly that the 
nations survival depended on what we were doing that nothing was 
more important to national security than getting ever more 
plutonium anything else that might interfere was secondary he 
said 
in a classified report written in december 1958 for general 
electric co which was running hanford under a government 
contract anderson urged that more money be spent to develop safer 
disposal methods for radioactive wastes he wrote the 
probability of the superiority of alternate methods of waste 
disposal has long been recognized but the pressing problems of 
weapons production precluded any but the most cursory 
examinations of these alternatives 
he said his report was shelved years later he had to file a 
request under the freedom of information act to obtain a copy 
today hanford is considered the most extensively contaminated 
piece of land in the united states perhaps in the world 
the governments own advisers were sounding the alarm on nuclear 
waste as early as 1955 in that year the national academy of 
sciences formed a committee to advise the atomic energy commission 
on waste disposal 
the committee concluded in late 1955 that dumping radioactive 
wastes directly into the ground probably involves unacceptable 
longterm risks to the environment yet such practices continued 
for more three decades 
hopkins the martin marietta manager at oak ridge says id 
be surprised if officials there were told prior to the 1980s that 
dumping wastes directly into the ground carried the risk of serious 
environmental damage 
if they had i dont think wed have done it he said 
regardless of the reasons the hazards posed by huge 
accumulations of nuclear wastes now represents a technological 
challenge for america unlike any it has faced since the dawn of the 
atomic age 
weve scratched the surface says duffy the energy 
department waste czar we know the problems we dont know the 
solutions 
one of the least understood problems is how much of the nuclear 
graveyards can be excavated or treated without putting workers at 
unacceptable risk 
frank l parker who headed oak ridge national laboratorys 
radioactive waste management research in the late 1950s and early 
1960s and now teaches environmental engineering at vanderbilt 
university in nashville tenn says the country will have to 
accept that some nuclear wastes are too dangerous to remove 
the number of deaths youre going to incur to clean it up will 
dwarf the number who would be killed if you left it alone he 
says

its a lean political year for new 
england governors grappling with an economic slump deficits and 
rebellious taxpayers woes that could worsen according to a 
vermont republican who wants to reclaim the state house and try to 
manage them 
i think i can create a sense of orderliness in hard times 
said richard a snelling a fourterm governor running for a 
reprise while incumbent governors are facing the backlash of those 
hard times snelling is campaigning with the status and the name 
recognition of incumbency but without the downside of blame for 
the slackening economy 
that confronts democrat peter welch with difficult odds and he 
knows it this is not going to be an uphill campaign he said 
in launching his bid it is an upmountain campaign 
welch 43 a lawyer and former president of the state senate 
got into the race after democratic gov madeleine m kunin got out 
in april she had succeeded snelling when he retired in 1984 
now snelling is running against her record after an 
administration that had to increase taxes cut and scrape programs 
to produce the balanced budget that gov kunin delivered this month 
it creates an easy cruising agenda for the republican welch 
said the other day at his cramped cluttered campaign headquarters 
across the railroad tracks from the lake champlain docks but welch 
said he has the campaign time and the issues to overcome the 
snelling advantage he said hes talking with voters about tax 
fairness for the middle class health care housing education 
snelling counters the new governor wont have much money to 
spend its going to be tough next year he said the next 
governor isnt going to get to solve problems with money 
he advocates budgeting based on economic cycles up or down 
snelling said governments should spend what is necessary not 
whats available cutting taxes when economic boom times swell 
revenues accepting deficits when the economy slumps 
hes the babe ruth of vermont deficits welch said he 
holds all the records 
snelling is a businessman hes been managing investments most 
of them his own since he left the governors office with time out 
to lose badly in a 1986 senate challenge at his upstairs offices 
at a south burlington shopping mall he is addressed as governor 
the photographs on the wall show him in that role with presidents 
and party leaders 
not long ago one of his campaign aides called the state house 
to ask for some budget information for the governor and was archly 
reminded that the governors name is kunin 
in retirement he was an ocean sailor now he is selling his 
46foot sailboat saying he knows there will not be time to use it 
in the job he expects to win back 
theres a great deal of difference between fun and 
satisfaction snelling said 
so when supporters began saying he should come out of retirement 
at 63 he listened if a lot of people say we need you thats 
very powerful stuff snelling said 
hed expected to run against gov kunin but she became the 
third new england democrat to decide against seeking reelection as 
governor this year gov william a oneill of connecticut opted 
out earlier in the spring gov michael s dukakis of massachusetts 
did so more than a year ago the slump and its budget impact were 
factors in all three states 
the regions other three governors are republicans all seeking 
reelection all handicapped by financial problems 
in new hampshire gov judd gregg has just told his 
administrators there will have to be more spending and personnel 
cuts to check a swelling deficit blaming saying he cant forecast 
when the slump will end 
three democrats seek the nomination to challenge gregg 
tax and budget troubles also are plaguing gov edward diprete of 
rhode island a conservative who had to reverse his pledge against 
tax increases this spring and hes facing a struggle to hold on 
for a fourth term 
snelling acknowledges he might have political problems of his 
own if hed been in office when the economy faltered but he also 
said he managed the state government through two recessions without 
losing his support i dont think the voters are just guaranteed 
to turn on you in hard times he said 
he said a politician who takes credit for an economic boom is 
going to suffer politically for a slowdown if you tout the 
massachusetts miracle and it ends then you will be forced to take 
the blame he said 
thats what happened to democrat dukakis 
a broader slump could confront president bush with similar 
problems in 1992 after nearly a decade of campaign claims that 
republicans policies are the path to uninterrupted economic growth 
the slowdown in new england is contagious warned new 
hampshires gov gregg i dont see how the rest of the nation 
can not be drawn in

lowfat cheeses allfruit jams and lowcalorie 
crackers are making inroads in the fancy foods industry and 
healthconscious eaters can find satisfaction in the gourmet 
section if they look carefully 
allnatural was a common rallying cry as purveyers showed 
off 20000 foods at the 36th annual international fancy food and 
confection show last week but even if allnatural which generally 
has no legal meaning most of the samples spread out for potential 
customers were more likely to be buttery or chocolatey than 
slimming 
people are trying to eat healthy most of the time said 
ronald tanner spokesman for the national association for the 
specialty food trade inc and then when theyre splurging 
theyre really splurging 
most of the time people who buy fancier foods try to satisfy 
their urges with foods that carry rich flavors but at little cost 
to the waistline 
flavor is the real big selling point people want to eat 
healthy but they dont want to just eat lettuce tanner said 
for the first time this years trade show included a seminar on 
healthy foods 
so there are mustards green chili mustard sage mustard wine 
and champagne mustards sweet mustards and wild rice organic 
baked beans oats added to pancake mixes organically grown teas 
goats milk yogurt organic maple syrup elevencalorie cookies 
but just as in the supermarket consumers should read labels at 
gourmet shops organic doesnt mean lowcalorie and 
cholesterolfree doesnt mean no fat a sugarfree product may have 
as many calories as one with sugar 
le slim cow a butter substitute made with buttermilk was 
promoted as having half the fat of butter or margarine and just 57 
calories compared with 103 calories per serving of butter 
however its makers st hubert of rolling hills estates calif 
warn that the high moisture content of le slim cow makes it 
unsuitable for frying 
elan foods inc has introduced a chocolatecovered frozen yogurt 
bar thats available east of the mississippi and should be 
available nationwide in a year or so said joanne biltekoff who 
runs the company with her husband 
while a bar has 230 calories and 13 grams of fat a premium ice 
cream bar has 350 calories and 22 fat grams 
salsas and chile sauces were plentiful at the show san angel 
la preferida montezuma corn mother red and green salsas one made 
with eggplant one with dried tomatoes one from canada 
generally these have little fat though eating them with 
tortilla chips cancels any advantage try them with bread or 
vegetables instead 
the baker brand of breads includes varieties made from 
stoneground grains but the companys booth also included rich 
brownies and a vermont company called food 2000 offered vegetarian 
chili there were organic vegetable pates from threefold 
international co ltd in carrot chestnut mushroom and other 
flavors 
but temptation lurked everywhere 
across the aisle from golightly sugarfree candies was a big pan 
of tiramisu the italian dessert made with highfat cheese

a federal plan to save a rare cactus that 
grows in utah and colorado includes a crackdown on professional and 
amateur growers who have been digging up the plants for private 
collections 
the us fish and wildlife services draft recovery plan for the 
uinta basin hookless cactus or sclerocactus glaucus notes the 
plant is prized by growers for its purplishred flowers 
the colorado population has lost an estimated 200 to 300 plants 
to collectors since 1977 but there are no estimates for losses in 
utah the document said its total population is estimated at 
20000 plants 
the plan calls for increased monitoring by the fish and wildlife 
service the bureau of land management and local law enforcement 
officers 
it also encourages the service to work with cactus 
horticulturists to try to provide a source of the plants to satisfy 
the horticultural demand 
the cactus was designated a threatened species in 1979 and is 
protected under the federal endangered species act 
other threats to the cactus include oil shale development gold 
mining oil and gas development sand and gravel quarrying 
building stone collection offroad vehicles and water development 
the recovery plan contains provisions to reduce the threat from 
those sources

a university researcher is trying to 
get softshell crayfish to keep that shell longer 
people like to eat these creatures when theyre soft because 
they can eat the whole animal not just the tail and claws and 
they dont have to work to take out the meat said michele 
wheatly a university of florida zoologist 
most restaurants dont offer them regularly because they cant 
be assured of a steady supply 
as crayfish and other crustaceans grow they shed their hard 
shells to reveal a new soft one underneath it takes a day or two 
for the soft shell to harden 
wheatly is studying whether this molting process can be 
manipulated to last longer so that more softshell crustaceans can 
be caught learning how these creatures absorb calcium to harden 
their shells is a key she said 
in studies on crayfish in florida wheatly found that calcium 
must be absorbed within a certain time after molting begins 
usually three to four days or a hard skeleton cannot form 
were trying to figure out what the mechanism is for getting 
the calcium into the skeleton and why its so important that this 
happens right away she said if we can stop calcification from 
starting we may be able to prolong the softshell state 
that would allow the commercial fishing industry to serve a 
growing restaurant market and could encourage the development of 
new crustacean fisheries wheatly said 
wheatly who received a 250000 grant from the national science 
foundation said the research may have application for people 
by studying the mechanism that moves calcium in and out of the 
skeletons of crustaceans we may be able to learn something about 
what happens in human bone she said

the publisher of working woman sassy and other 
magazines plans to launch a new television network this fall that 
will feature classic tv show reruns along with directresponse 
advertising programs 
dale lang chairman of the newly created star television network 
inc said 23 independent uhf stations reaching more than 137 
million of the nations 92 million tv households have agreed to 
carry the service starting in september 
stations that sign affiliation agreements will be given eight 
hours of television programs a day consisting of series such as 
life of riley the invaders and richard diamond movies 
and game shows lang said 
the programming concept will be marketed as tv heaven and 
affiliate stations will be encouraged to use that term in their own 
promotions 
in exchange for the programs the stations must run at least 
four hours a day of directresponse programs also called 
infomercials these are programlength commercials in which a 
marketer typically demonstrates a product and invites viewers to 
call in to order 
lang said star television and the producers of the infomercials 
would share revenue from sales of the products or services with 
affiliate stations 
in addition stations would be given the option of using shorter 
directresponse advertising ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes 
to fill any gaps they may have in their commercial schedules 
informercials were once a staple of some cable networks but 
have fallen into disfavor as those networks have grown and found 
more traditional revenue sources 
media critics have long faulted television stations for carrying 
such programming because viewers may not always recognize it as 
paid programming created expressly to sell a particular product or 
service 
but lang said this type of programming can help stations cut 
their operating losses and make it economically feasible for 
holders of fcc construction permits to proceed with new uhf 
stations 
he said star eventually will produce original programming for 
its network and anticipates generating product sales of more than 
100 million in its second year in operation 
a spokeswoman for lang could not say how much was being invested 
in the new network the network will be transmitted to member 
stations via satellite from the mcauniversal studios in orlando 
fla lang said 
lang also heads lang communications a new yorkbased media 
company that publishes working woman working mother sassy and 
success magazines 
it plans to resume publishing ms magazine later this month as

federal regulators have ordered the nations 
largest banks to write off as a loss large portions of about 14 
billion in outstanding loans to economically troubled brazil and 
argentina 
the order requires 36 affected banks to write off 20 percent of 
about 11 billion in loans to brazil and to increase writeoffs of 
29 billion in loans to argentina to 60 percent from 40 percent 
the writeoff of brazilian loans is the first required by 
federal authorities and comes as the south american nation 
undertakes economic reform and is seeking new loans to bolster 
industry 
brazil and argentina are far in arrears on debt repayments 
neither country has negotiated debt forgiveness with the united 
states a step taken by mexico last year and venezuela earlier this 
year 
bank officials speaking on condition of anonymity wednesday 
confirmed the receipt of letters ordering the writedowns in recent 
days from the interagency country exposure review committee 
the panel consists of representatives of the federal reserve 
board the office of the controller of the currency and the federal 
deposit insurance corp it normally does not announce its decisions 
the action could force some of the banks to further boost 
reserves to protect against losses from nonperforming loans to 
developing nations money that would be subtracted from profits 
it a bank has enough money set aside in reserves to cover bad 
loans then the new writedowns should not affect earnings 
the 20 percent writeoff of argentine debt was the third ordered 
by federal authorities 
brazils was considered surprising because the country has 
undertaken economic reform under new president fernando collor de 
mello and is expected to resume negotiations this year on meeting 
some bank debt obligations 
citicorp the nations largest bank holding company declined to 
comment on the regulatory action but it said the bank already had 
written down 60 percent of its argentine exposure from a 1 billion 
reserve created last year 
any other such writedowns voluntary or mandated would 
likewise be charged to the reserve without earnings impact the 
statement said 
thats the reason for taking such provisions and reserves 
citicorp said the earnings impact occurs when they are taken 
not when a writedown subsequently occurs 
citicorp would be forced to write off 660 million of its 33 
billion exposure to brazilian loans under the new mandate 
officials said it would not have to take further writedowns 
against its current 400 million exposure to argentine loans 
brazil has not paid interest on its longterm debt for more than 
a year and has a total foreign debt of about 113 billion 
argentina which has debt of about 62 billion last month began 
paying 40 million a month in interest still far short of its 
interest obligations 
the federal committee can order banks to write off loans if a 
country fall six months behind in payments unless it is attempting 
to make progress on paying its debt both argentina and brazil have 
implemented some economic reforms but apparently not enough to 
persuade regulators not to take action

congress needs to overhaul regulation of the 
securities and banking industries according to the head of the 
securities and exchange commission but he isnt ready to recommend 
the best way to do it 
in testimony before a house panel wednesday sec chairman 
richard c breeden also outlined several suggestions for reversing 
us financial firms declining market share over the last decade 
but he cautioned against piecemeal change for the mere sake of 
change 
the level of unnecessary costs created by the us regulatory 
system could become a significant factor in the international 
competitiveness of us firms breeden told a subcommittee 
considering proposals to update a nearly 60yearold banking law 
he noted that in 1970 seven of the worlds 25 largest banks were 
based in the united states while today just one is usbased with 
most of the others are headquartered in japan 
breeden was among several witnesses testifying before the 
finance subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee 
critics of existing regulation have called for repealing the 
glasssteagall act the depressionera law that keeps most banks 
out of the securities business and vice versa 
such regulations critics maintain make the united states less 
able to compete for investment in the evershrinking global 
marketplace 
but breeden warned that deregulation must be a twoway street 
he said if congress repeals glasssteagall it simultaneously should 
amend the bank holding company act of 1956 to permit bank ownership 
by nonbanking companies 
banks should not be free to acquire securities firms while 
many securities and other major us firms remain as a practical 
matter unable to acquire banks he said 
similar views were expressed by other witnesses including 
samuel j baptista president of the financial services council a 
washingtonbased trade group of 25 banks securities firms and 
other financial service companies 
the issue at hand is not deregulation not reregulation and 
not broader powers for banks he said the issue before 
congress is comprehensive restructuring of our financial services 
industry that will benefit both financial services providers and 
consumers 
among his recommendations were opening all financial businesses 
to all companies financial and commercial that meet safety and 
soundness tests baptista also called for functional regulation 
whereby the banking operations of a financial firm would be 
regulated by banking regulators and the securities part by 
securities regulators 
richard stuart former head of the bank capital markets 
association a trade association of 100 banks and david silver 
president of the investment company institute a trade group 
representing mutual funds also supported functional regulation 
banks securities firms and others should be allowed to offer 
all financial services silver said 
in addition to repealing the 1933 glasssteagall act silver 
called for amending the bank holding company act so that it no 
longer confines the banking business to a restricted group of 
players 
in his testimony breeden critiqued ways of regulating financial 
firms after the barriers come down 
one version universal banking which allows banks to engage 
directly in a broad range of financial activities was fatally 
flawed he said 
universal banking which is used in west germany and elsewhere 
in europe would expand federal deposit insurance guarantees to 
bank ventures in the securities and insurance industries that 
would increase taxpayer risk in the event of a banks losses he 
said 
also no single federal regulator has the capability or expertise 
to examine all the different types of financial products that could 
be offered under universal banking breeden said

the bush administrations move to transfer 
authority for stockindex futures from one regulatory agency to 
another now faces testimony from supporters of the securities and 
exchange commission 
the administration is pushing legislation that would strip the 
commodity futures trading commission of regulatory authority over 
stockindex futures and hand it to the rival sec 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee is to 
conclude two days of hearings today with backers of the sec 
on wednesday sen christopher bond rmiss suggested a 
compromise that would allow the cftc to retain most regulation but 
allow the federal reserve board to set margin levels for trading 
stockindex futures 
margins are the downpayments or collateral paid by investors who 
buy securities or futures contracts on credit 
bond said the administration does not have enough senate votes 
to pass its measure 
stockindex futures often used in program trading strategies by 
large institutional investors such as pension funds allow 
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without 
having to buy the underlying stocks 
the cftc and the futures industry oppose any shift saying it 
will cripple the agencys ability to regulate other futures 
products and overregulate a segment of an industry thats battling 
to stave off foreign competition 
but the sec and the treasury department argue the move is 
necessary to curb volatility in the stock markets arising out of 
price differences between the futures and securities markets 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is scheduled to appear before 
the committee later today and witnesses representing the futures 
industry were slated to testify later this month 
the administration bill also seeks to give the sec authority to 
set margins for stockindex futures currently futures margins are 
set by the exchanges usually only a fraction of the amount 
required in securities transactions 
on wednesday a former top official of the chicago mercantile 
exchange blasted the cftc as a pygmy of federal regulation 
it was the second time thomas f eagleton who resigned from the 
merc last year had harsh words for the commodity futures trading 
commission 
last year his criticism came in a hearing before the senate 
agriculture committee which oversees the cftc 
in his testimony eagleton a former democratic senator from 
missouri criticized the cftcs light regulatory touch and its 
limited resources to investigate illegal activities 
the cftc is about as sluggish a regulatory agency as one can 
find he told the committee members 
recalling last years fbi undercover investigation of fraud in 
the chicago futures pits that led to more than 40 indictments 
eagleton said 
after the sting the cftc this pygmy of federal regulation 
overwhelmed by its daytoday operations came plodding along with 
toolittle toolate to catch fastmoving crooks and fastchanging 
events 
also testifying before the banking committee in favor of the 
jurisdictional switch were representatives of the national 
association of securities dealers the american stock exchange and 
the options clearing corp

farmers are harvesting a bumper wheat crop 
large enough to bring us production into line with demand for the 
first time since the mid1980s according to agriculture department 
analysts 
but less than half of the us output is used domestically 
meaning that the financial wellbeing of wheat farmers depends 
heavily on the export market 
also production is being stepped up in other countries 
including some of the biggest us export competitors production 
in the soviet union and china two huge markets for us wheat 
also is increasing this year 
globally says sara schwartz of usdas economic research 
service wheat production is expected to exceed consumption for the 
first time since 198788 meaning a modest recovery in world 
inventories during 199091 
that translates into lower wheat prices and an increase in world 
wheat trading including more for livestock feeding 
schwartz and colleague pete riley said in the july issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine that many livestock feeders around 
the world will turn more heavily to wheat as tight supplies of corn 
and other coarse grains bolster prices of traditional feed supplies 
major us competitors will have larger exportable supplies of 
wheat because of bigger crops this year reflecting favorable 
weather across much of northern europe improved moisture 
conditions in the canadian spring wheat areas and good planting 
conditions in argentina and parts of australia 
another reason will be the anticipated increase in the amount of 
wheat imported for livestock feeding the bulk of us exports is 
higherquality wheat used for milling into flour and other food 
products 
competitors especially the european community ec have 
historically been the major suppliers of wheat for feeding and 
probably will be the beneficiaries of increased trade in the coming 
year the report said 
schwartz in a telephone interview wednesday said the general 
outlook described in the report continues to hold up without 
significant recent changes 
the weather seems to be pretty good she said there still 
seems to be some questions about dryness in the ec but that would 
affect spring crops more than their winter wheat 
looking at the four major wheat competitors the report said 
wheat production in the 12nation ec is expected to be the second 
largest on record with yield increases most notable in france and 
the united kingdom 
canada is forecast to boost wheat output sharply in 199091 the 
report said canadian farmers have few production alternatives and 
planting conditions are better than last year 
although prices are down from 198990 those still are expected 
to make wheat attractive to producers 
in australia wheat production is expected to be down from last 
season because of lower yields the report said sheep production 
competes with wheat for land but wool prices recently dropped 
sharply and there are large stockpiles 
even though world wheat prices are likely to fall in 199091 
the relative change in prices between wheat and wool is making 
wheat more attractive to some producers the report said 
moreover depreciation of the australian dollar likely will 
cushion australian producers from the slide in prices 
argentina the fourth major us wheat competitor is expected 
to increase production although there is uncertainty because of 
inflation and farm costs 
but the argentine government has reduced export taxes on grain 
hoping to boost plantings although it is unclear what effect this 
might have on acreages 
despite these uncertainties many argentine farmers 
especially those who doublecrop soybeans probably need the income 
that wheat provides and likely will plant as much or more wheat 
than a year ago the report said

the agriculture department has expanded 
federal quarantine restrictions to control fire ants in all or 
parts of six southern states 
the quarantine is being expanded to keep up with the spread of 
the pests in alabama arkansas mississippi south carolina 
tennessee and texas 
other areas where federal quarantine restrictions continue 
unchanged include florida georgia louisiana north carolina 
oklahoma and puerto rico 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the restrictions are on the 
interstate movement of certain goods and equipment to prevent the 
artificial spread of the imported fire ant into uninfested areas 
for example nursery stock is treated before being shipped 
from infested areas to be sure it isnt harboring the ants he 
said 
the imported fire ant builds large mounds in fields and 
pastures the agency said 
fire ants can damage certain crops and the stings are painful 
to livestock pets and people not only on farms but also in the 
suburbs and cities of infested areas

western leaders managed a breakthrough in a 
longtroublesome trade dispute but still left it to their aides to 
do the hard bargaining needed to craft a final plan for revamping 
global commerce 
im not under any illusions that well be dealing with a new 
era by christmas or even by next spring canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney said at wednesdays close of a threeday 
economic summit 
president bush joined mulroney and other leaders of the seven 
richest democracies in pledging to make sharp cuts in government 
support for farmers a contentious issue in the current uruguay 
round of world trade talks 
what were trying to do is move the whole thing forward 
without saying that we have to have tomorrow totally unprotected 
trade bush told a news conference 
the leaders of japan west germany france britain canada 
italy and the united states took part in the summit a 
representative of the 12nation european community also attended 
the uruguay round talks involving some 100 countries have been 
stymied by a nasty dispute between the united states and its 
european trading partners over slashing government payments to 
farmers the united states wants the europeans to cut more than 
they have been willing to do so far 
the global trade bargaining which opened in 1986 is due to end 
in early december in brussels belgium 
to try to restart the negotiations aides to the summit leaders 
reached a lastminute compromise that promised substantial 
progressive reductions in export subsidies domestic price 
supports and barriers to imported goods the united states had 
wanted to target those three areas 
in a bow to the europeans the leaders acknowledged differences 
in the social and economic conditions of farming european 
officials contend they need their extensive subsidy program to 
protect their many smallscale farms 
the compromise also contained a european demand that they be 
allowed to work out a formula to measure and then reduce a 
variety of farm subsidies 
both sides claimed success 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said there were some 
quite tough discussions among the seven leaders over farm 
subsidies and even now progress on actual cuts would be slow 
but there has been movement on all sides she said 
jacques delors president of the european communitys executive 
body agreed this is clear progress on both sides 
we have finally gotten the european community engaged in a 
negotiation said a senior american official demanding 
anonymity that i do not believe has occurred to date 
the administration is counting on the talks to lower trade 
barriers and greatly expand opportunities for american farmers and 
businesses abroad the aim is to help narrow americas 100 
billionplus trade deficits 
the negotiations which began in uruguay in 1986 face a july 23 
bargaining session in geneva to draft basic agreements in 15 
separate areas including agriculture 
those outlines will then be used over the next five months to 
achieve a final deal by the december deadline 
looking ahead at the schedule the senior american official 
predicted negotiators will take three or four steps forward one 
back there will be times when we are discouraged and times when 
were elated 
the uruguay round is being held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and agreement for 
promoting freer trade

corrupt executives who pillaged the savings 
and loan industry would face an expanded army of investigators and 
longer prison terms under major crime legislation approved by the 
senate 
we need to be cracking down on the orgy of fraud and 
lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis sen 
patrick leahy dvt said wednesday as the crime bill was approved 
946 and sent to the house 
the savings and loan provisions came as a lastminute addition 
to the crime package which also would place curbs on nine kinds of 
semiautomatic assault weapons and make 34 federal offenses 
punishable by death 
senate approval of more money new weapons and fresh troops to 
aid prosecutors put pressure on the bush administration to clean up 
the scandal 
lawmakers said the sampl scandal was heating up as an issue on the 
congressional campaign trail 
the only lawmaker to oppose the provisions sen william 
armstrong rcolo acknowledged that while calling the bill a 
kneejerk response to the outrage that is spreading across the 
country over the savings and loan crisis 
the plan provides for 1625 million in each of the next three 
years to increase the number of agents and prosecutors pursuing sampl 
fraud and embezzlement cases 
sponsors said the funds would allow the fbi to add 224 agents 
and 146 support aides while permitting us attorneys offices to 
bring on 205 more prosecutors plus 205 support workers and 50 
auditors 
the justice departments tax civil and criminal divisions would 
be fortified with 104 attorneys and 78 support workers in addition 
to those added after 50 million was appropriated in the current 
fiscal year 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee and floor manager of the bill estimated the 
overall price tag as 2 billion a year starting in 1991 and 
acknowledged that the source of the funds was uncertain 
the measure would also authorize 16 million for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 for the internal revenue service to expand its 
corps of investigators pursuing savings and loan cases 
a new financial institutions fraud unit would be established in 
the justice department the measure also would establish strike 
forces composed of fbi agents irs investigators bank examiners 
and prosecutors in cities hardest hit by the scandal 
maximum prison time for bank fraud and embezzlement would be 
increased from 20 years to 30 years under the plan and mandatory 
minimums would be set 
the bill also provides life sentences as a maximum for a special 
category of sampl kingpins who act in concert with three others 
and derive more than 5 million from their crimes 
the bill would expand the possible use of the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act against sampl crime federal 
prosecutors would gain power to seize and freeze assets of savings 
and loan looters under the measure and whistle blowers could get 
rewards of up to 300000 for helping put perpetrators behind bars 
it is essential that those who broke the law be pursued 
aggressively and brought to justice said sen timothy wirth 
dcolo 
of we give the fbi and the us attorneys more help the 
department of justice will be able to make progress against the 
significant backlog of cases and pursue new cases wirth said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas was critical of 
slick political operatives who are trying to capitalize on the 
sampl issue for fall congressional campaigns 
he called it good news for the american people who dont want 
to trivialize an american financial tragedy with illconceived 
efforts to achieve shortterm political gain

president bushs son neil was unqualified to 
be a director of a colorado thrift but that doesnt excuse him 
from harm caused to the institution that failed at a cost of 1 
billion federal regulators say 
neil bush described himself wednesday as just a denver guy 
trying to make a living and raise a family and not as a 
freewheeling former director of silverado banking savings and loan 
association 
bush 34 continued to deny conflict of interest allegations 
raised against him by thrift regulators 
meanwhile president bush strongly defended his son on 
wednesday saying he has confidence in his honor and integrity 
the president who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in 
the savings and loan industry repeated his promise not to 
interfere with regulators investigation of his son 
if hes done something wrong the system will digest that 
he told a news conference in houston this is not easy for me as 
a father its easy for me as a president because the system is 
going to work i am not going to intervene 
in documents released by the office of thrift supervision 
regulators asserted that neil bush was unqualified and 
untrained for his position as an outside director of denverbased 
silverado 
certainly he had no experience in managing a large 
corporation especially a financial institution with almost 2 
billion in assets said the documents released this week 
unfortunately he was not cognizant of the conflictofinterest 
situations he encountered as a director of silverado 
however the regulators added bushs inexperience does not 
excuse him from the harm and potential harm he caused to the 
thrift 
the younger bush has been ordered by the thrift office to answer 
allegations of conflict of interest in his role as a director of 
silverado which lent millions of dollars to his business partner 
who never repaid the money 
at a news conference in denver neil bush said i am standing 
on very solid ground when it comes to defending my role as an 
outside director 
he said that his father had wanted me to keep a little lower 
profile 
however he told reporters for the denver post after the news 
conference that he is thinking about running for congress because 
he thinks there should be more congressional accountability i 
may run he said not anytime soon because its something i 
have to build up to but if i do it its probably going to be with 
the intent of being part of a shakeup 
the federal government is considering filing lawsuits to recover 
misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1300 failed 
banks and savings institutions officials told a congressional 
hearing wednesday neil bush could be among the defendants 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp appearing at wednesdays hearing declined to comment on 
whether fdic officials have recommended whether to sue neil bush 
we are treating the silverado case the way we treat every 
other case seidman told the house judiciary subcommittee on 
criminal justice every failed institution we go into and make a 
thorough investigation of whether or not there is the possibility 
of civil or criminal activity 
in other savings and loan developments wednesday 
the senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison 
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to 
whistleblowers for turning in sampl looters 
the former president of one of texas largest collapsed thrifts 
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a 700 million 
real estate scheme fbi officials in dallas announced the 
indictment against edwin t mcbirney iii former president of 
sunbelt savings association 
the regulators asserted that bush was unqualified to sit on 
silverados board they noted that he graduated from college in 
1977 worked on his fathers political campaign for a year and 
received a masters degree in business administration in 1979 
the documents also noted that bush worked as an oil lease 
negotiator for amoco production co in denver from 1980 through 
late 1982 and later started his own oil company jnb exploration 
he became a director of silverado in the summer of 1985 and quit 
the job in august 1988 shortly after his father won the republican 
presidential nomination 
in earlier years bush held summer jobs with republic national 
bank in dallas and a small oil equipment company there

western leaders put their deadlocked trade talks 
back on course and christened a new era of economic cooperation 
with the soviet union in a summit president bush says has 
strengthened free wills and free markets for all mankind 
bush before returning to washington early today declared his 
meeting with the six other leaders of the worlds richest nations 
had not only been a success but it has been a celebration 
in houston the presidents and prime ministers who lead the 
largest industrialized democracies met to build a world beyond the 
cold war the president told a farewell party in his adopted 
hometown 
he declared the summit partners had managed to uphold the 
revolution of 89 to help liberated nations enter the 21st 
century as enduring democracies to support free wills and free 
markets for all mankind 
the threeday economic summit along with a nato gathering in 
london last week saw bush and his western colleagues groping for 
ways to keep pace with the challenge of a world in transition 
bush said his summit partners all left feeling good at the 
end of the houston meeting 
the leaders agreed despite what british prime minister margaret 
thatcher called some tough discussions to broad cuts in farm 
subsidies which are at the heart of longfestering charges of 
unfair trade practices among the allies 
coming after last weeks very successful nato summit which 
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world the results of 
the meeting in houston are an important step towards a more 
prosperous world for everyone mrs thatcher said 
even mrs thatcher the most enthusiastic backer of the 
compromise deal on subsidies acknowledged that the process of 
actually reducing them will be slow 
west germanys helmut kohl and frances francois mitterrand were 
reconciled to the summits refusal at us insistence to grant 
direct aid to the soviet union to the end however italys guilio 
andreotti sought a united western aid package to the kremlin 
when someone is ill you dont want to wait for medicine 
instead in a communique the leaders of the united states 
canada japan and the four major west european nations urged the 
soviet union to reform its crumbling economy and commissioned a 
study of soviet needs 
they offered the prospect of meaningful and sustained aid if 
moscow cut military spending and stopped supporting regional 
troublemakers an apparent reference to soviet aid to cuba north 
korea syria libya and vietnam 
bush did not rule out american cash for the kremlin after the 
study supervised by the international monetary fund is completed at 
the end of the year but he was cool about that prospect 
we have some problems im not particularly enthusiastic about 
the intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at us cities 
bush told reporter he added as he has on several occasions that 
he found soviet aid to cuba a little contradictory 
the first reaction from moscow was favorable foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady i gerasimov said his country welcomed new 
approaches that correspond to the spirit of the times 
the summit the first since the collapse of the berlin wall and 
the end of communist governments in half a dozen east european 
countries appeared to mark the start of a new era of economic 
cooperation between the west and mosow 
bush sent an immediate telegram to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev about the outcome assuring him technical assistance 
would continue apace treasury secretary nicholas brady said 
bush told reporters on air force one that he messaged gorbachev 
that i was going to call him in a couple of days plus 
congratulated him on his victory in the communist party congress 
in addition secretary of state james a baker iii was due to 
give a personal briefing to soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze within days 
on the environment the leaders of the socalled g7 group 
compromised too the europeans did not push bush for specific 
ceilings on gas emissions blamed for global warming of the 
environment 
the communique said the seven nations would work to stop to stem 
global warming as expeditiously as possible 
overriding us arguments that more study of the causes of 
global warming is needed the joint statement said lack of full 
scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are 
justified in their own right 
the final agreement on the agricultural front called for 
acrosstheboard cuts in all categories of farm subsidies 
however the lastminute compromise between the united states 
and the europeans also allows the nations to measure subsidies in a 
way washington has opposed 
the united states has been pushing since 1987 for an end to 
agricultural subsidies which cost taxpayers and consumers in 
developed nations an estimated 245 billion annually 
the european community is resisting saying bushs demands would 
put 3 million farmers out of business 
there were fears before the summit that the international trade 
talks known as the uruguay round would collapse 
but most leaders said they were confident the political push 
from the houston summit would help bring a deal by years end 
said mrs thatcher the great achievement of the summit has 
been to make it easier for all of us to reject shortterm soft 
options in favor of longerterm solutions

a new federal seat belt regulation for 
american workers that will cost employers about 220 million a year 
in training costs could be regulatory overkill a spokesman for 
us business says 
its perhaps a little more nitpicking than one would like to 
see fred krebs of the us chamber of commerce said wednesday 
reacting to a new rule that will require 35 million american 
workers to use seat belts on the job 
in theory a business could be fined if one of its workers was 
caught not wearing a seat belt 
the regulation announced by labor secretary elizabeth dole is 
disturbing because it shows a mindset that washington knows 
best krebs said 
under the new rule workers who drive on the job anyone from 
delivery people to traveling salesmen to cab drivers will have to 
wear seat belts even business people riding in taxis would have to 
buckle up 
the rule a proposed addition to standards that fall under the 
occupational safety and health administration would exempt people 
who are selfemployed or businesses with 10 or fewer workers 
employers would also have to provide training courses for 
workers who drive on a routine basis the rule will not take effect 
until after a 120day waiting period and possibly a hearing next 
january 
mrs dole estimated that the rule will cost the 54 million us 
businesses that will be affected by it about 220 million a year 
or about 6 for each driver krebs predicted the rule would end up 
costing businesses more than that 
businesses that violate osha regulations face fines of up to 
10000 but mrs dole said only employers guilty of willful and 
egregious violations of the seat belt regulation would be subject 
to the maximum 
fine points of the regulation such as whether it includes farm 
workers who ride in the back of trucks still have to be worked 
out she said 
the regulation will be difficult to enforce mrs dole said but 
federal inspectors will make checks of seat belt use among workers 
part of their routine 
mrs dole said the new rule could save an estimated 685 lives a 
year 
but krebs manager of the chamber of commerces 
businessgovernment policy department said it could be 
regulatory overkill and that there might be more significant 
safety and health issues that osha could be addressing 
seat belts are a good thing and people should wear them but 
whether or not this is a good regulation for osha is debatable 
he said 
there are limits to what employers can do to regulate the 
conduct of their employees krebs added 
the aflcio which represents 142 million unionized workers 
praised the new regulation but said the standard also needs to 
require vehicle inspection and maintenance 
the seatbelt rule is a first step in reducing the high toll 
of jobrelated motor vehicle fatalities and injuries the labor 
federation said in a statement 
since 1984 when states began passing seat belt laws belt use 
among the general public has risen from 14 percent to 46 percent 
mrs dole told a news conference thirtysix states with 88 percent 
of the us population now have seat belt laws she said 
under the training programs required by the new federal 
regulation employers will have to familiarize workers with their 
vehicles and give instructions on seat belt use and on the effects 
of drinking and driving 
i think people pay a lot of attention to what their bosses are 
telling them on the job mrs dole said 
automobile accidents are the single largest cause of 
occupational fatalities causing about 2100 jobrelated deaths a 
year she said 
mrs dole chose wednesday to announce the new rule because it 
marks the sixth anniversary of a regulation she pushed through as 
transportation secretary in the reagan administration that 
requires all new cars to be equipped with seat belts

japans trade surplus expanded 28 percent in june 
to 672 billion only the second time in 14 months it had climbed 
from a year earlier the ministry of finance reported thursday 
the countrys surplus with the united states however narrowed 
to 325 billion in june from 362 billion in june 1989 the 10 
percent decline was good news in the wake of a recent agreement 
aimed at reducing trade frictions between the two countries 
for the first six months of the year japans overall 
merchandise trade surplus shrank 228 percent to 2579 billion 
from 3339 billion in the yearearlier period the ministry said 
imports for the six months totaled 10815 billion up 56 
percent from 10243 billion the year before exports slipped 14 
percent to 13394 billion from 13584 billion 
foreign ministry officials attributed the june reversal to a 
drop in import values resulting from a decrease in world commodity 
prices and slowed domestic demand at the same time the export 
values of many bigticket items sold by japan grew they said 
kazuko mizuno an economist at baring securities japan ltd 
said export growth had accelerated since the yen began depreciating 
rapidly at the beginning of the year and import growth slowed 
when the dollar is between 150 and 160 yen japanese exports 
are quite competitive and its quite easy for japanese corporations 
to increase exports mizuno said 
the dollar closed at 14890 yen on the tokyo foreign exchange 
market thursday but it has been above 150 yen for much of the year 
june exports to the united states fell 67 percent to 74 
billion in part because of sluggish car sales but imports from 
the united states also slipped down 37 percent to 415 billion 
partly because of slowed purchases of lumber and aircraft 
the overall rise from 527 billion in june 1989 to 672 
billion last month marked only the second time since april 1989 
that the nations trade gap widened from the same month in the 
previous year the last yearonyear increase was in march when 
japans trade surplus broadened to 709 billion from 661 billion 
imports in june decreased by 22 percent to 1704 billion from 
1742 billion in june 1989 while exports edged up 47 percent to 
2376 billion from 2268 billion 
excluding march when imports slipped because of extraordinary 
factors the yearonyear decrease in imports was the first since 
february 1987 finance ministry officials said

marcelo gumucio president and chief 
operating officer of cray research inc on thursday resigned from 
both positions and from the supercomputer companys board of 
directors 
cray chairman and chief executive officer john a rollwagen 
announced the resignation in a letter to employees saying he and 
gumucio were unable to agree on implementing a longrange 
strategy for the company 
we attempted to blend our distinct management styles 
effectively but were not successful in that effort rollwagen 
said in his letter the decision to part is mutual and in the 
best overall interests of the organization and the individuals 
involved 
rollwagen said for the foreseeable future he will assume 
gumucios responsibilities in addition to retaining his other 
titles 
rollwagen was not specific in the letter about the nature of his 
disagreements with gumucio 
neither rollwagen nor gumucio immediately returned phone calls 
seeking comment 
gumucio became president of cray in november 1988 he joined the 
company in 1983 as executive vice president of marketing 
at the companys annual meeting in may gumucio said cray 
planned to continue expanding its line of supercomputers in the 
1990s he said the companys introduction of a new smaller 
supercomputer was an example of how the company was developing 
outward from its original focus on the most powerful computers 
cray now is focused on a variety of products to fit the growing 
demand for computer networking he said then 
cray suffered a slump in 1989 with sales up just 4 percent to 
7847 million and earnings declining 43 percent to 89 million 
in april however cray reported its firstquarter profit 
totaled 95 million compared with 15 million for the same 
period in 1989 the company also said then that it expected its 
profit for the entire year to be higher

fisherprice toys the troubled quaker 
oats co unit said thursday that it is closing a nearby factory 
and slashing jobs at its headquarters here in a move that will cut 
more than 500 workers from its payroll 
some 245 jobs will be eliminated at the companys headquarters 
and between 300 and 400 jobs will be lost when the shutdown of the 
plant in holland ny is completed by november until recently 
the plant made molded plastic parts that were shipped to the east 
aurora plant for assembly 
company officials said the move coupled with the closing of 
another plant in east aurora earlier this year would make 
fisherprice profitable again 
fisherprice is expected to have lost about 445 million during 
the fiscal year that was just completed and the first three months 
of the current fiscal year 
the closing of the holland plant was necessary because of the 
excess capacity throughout our manufacturing system and the 
continued decline in sales volume ronald f jackson chairman 
and chief executive officer said in a statement 
in february fisherprice terminated 450 employees when it closed 
its east aurora plant following the reductions announced thursday 
the company will employ a total of 6400 workers 
fisherprice is scheduled to be spun off from its parent 
company chicagobased quaker oats in early january and become an 
independent freestanding company that will be publicly traded 
fisherprice spokeswoman carol blackley said the company needs 
to take the drastic measures to recoup its losses and be as 
strong as we can possibly be when we go public

house and senate negotiators today approved 
major civil rights legislation for disabled americans after 
agreeing on a provision that would help protect the jobs of 
aidsinfected workers who handle food 
sponsors predicted quick final action in both chambers and said 
the legislation could reach president bushs desk by the weekend 
the legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled 
americans 43 million according to congressional estimates in 
employment access to restaurants stores and other commercial 
establishments transportation and telecommunciations 
the aids provision approved by the senate 991 wednesday night 
would allow owners of restaurants packing companies and other food 
businesses to reassign aidsinfected workers only if medical 
evidence shows a need 
health and human services secretary louis w sullivan has said 
no evidence exists for removing aidsinfected people from 
foodhandling jobs 
most scientists believe aids is more difficult to spread 
through intimate sexual contact punctures with needles or other 
contaminated objects and transfusions of contaminated blood 
products 
its a clear message that aids needs to be dealt with in a 
responsible way and we need to reject appeals to prejudice and 
bigotry said gregory king a spokesman for the human rights 
campaign fund a gay rights group male homosexuals and intravenous 
drug users have been the chief victims of the fatal disease 
the vote wednesday represents a reversal of a previous senate 
vote and a defeat for sen jesse helms rnc who said the fear 
of aids would drive any restaurant out of business if the public 
learned a chef or other employee were infected he cast the lone 
negative vote 
supporters say the bill is the most comprehensive piece of civil 
rights legislation since the civil rights act of 1964 outlawed 
discrimination against blacks 
president bush has asked congress to speed up passage of the 
bill which the senate approved last september by a 768 vote 
the house passed its version in may 40320 after including an 
amendment giving employers the right to reassign foodservice 
workers with aids or other contagious diseases regardless of how 
they are spread 
the vote wednesday was on a proposal by sen orrin hatch 
rutah under it the health and human services department would 
have to evaluate all contagious diseases each year hhs would then 
determine which diseases could be spread through food handling 
foodservice employers would be able to reassign workers whose 
diseases are determined to be passed along through such contact 
tuberculosis for example 
all it says is lets use science lets not use 
conjecture hatch said 
helms however said evidence that aids cannot be transmitted 
through such casual contact is short of conclusive he referred to 
scientific findings as conventional wisdom 
i dont want to go to that convention he said i dont 
want to take that chance 
on june 6 the senate voted 5340 at helms urging to support 
the house aids provision later that month however house and 
senate negotiators refused to include that amendment in their 
compromise version of the bill 
on wednesday the senate voted 6139 to reject a similar helms 
amendment

the opera singer who was the voice

company does business in the state an appeals court ruled 
the decision wednesday could mean a speedier trial for mary 
costa voice of the title character in disneys 1959 animated film 
sleeping beauty the palm beach soprano is seeking an 
unspecified cut of the 60 million the company made from the 
movies videocassette release in 1986 
disney attorneys had hoped to move the lawsuit from palm beach 
county to california where the suit could have languished for 
years in the states overburdened judicial system 
the company originally argued to have the florida case thrown 
out because disney is a delaware corporation with its primary place 
of business in california 
circuit judge stephen rapp refused to dismiss the case and 
disney attorneys appealed his decision to the 4th district court of 
appeals 
ms costas suit claims disney breached its contract with her by

investigators are looking into allegations that 
new york telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and 
prostitutes at annual conventions of company employees the wall 
street journal reported today 
state regulators are questioning whether the meetings at florida 
resorts resulted in higher costs being paid by customers the 
newspaper said 
the meetings held for one week each year from 198488 
allegedly involved improper contact between employees of materiel 
enterprises co the purchasing unit of new york telephone 
corporate parent nynex and about 30 company suppliers the journal 
said 
annual awards were handed out to the wildest attendees of the 
events the journal reported one nynex worker won the 
procurement award three times in a row for his efforts in 
enticing women to attend the parties 
other honorees included the most valuable pervert and the 
winner of the moon over miami award for unspecified 
activities the journal said 
the story comes on the same day that state attorney robert 
abrams planned to announce his opposition to new york telephones 
request for a 965 million rate hike 
steve marcus a new york telephone spokesman denied today that 
the parties had resulted in higher costs to any of his companys 
customers 
we want to emphasize theres been no general increase in rates 
since 1986 so no ratepayer funds are involved in any of the 
allegations about overcharges marcus said nynex is preparing a 
response to the charges he said 
nynex refused to discuss the florida meetings with the journal 
but the paper reported that at rate hearings held by the state 
public service commission nynex officials said details of the 
parties and the names of those involved were trade secrets that 
need not be disclosed 
abrams disputes that argument and is trying to get the 
testimony about the florida parties unsealed

after repeated criticism for failing to round up 
big names involved in the collapse of the nations thrift industry 
the government has indicted two major executives in recent weeks 
and is promising more 
on wednesday officials announced the 17count indictment of 
edwin t mcbirney iii once a flamboyant young financier who 
presided over the tremendous growth and 25 billion failure of 
sunbelt savings association of texas 
attorney general richard thornburgh said the indictment 
returned by one of three grand juries in dallas investigating bank 
and thrift fraud marks another milestone in our crackdown on 
fraud in the thrift industry 
since oct 1 1988 justice department prosecutors have obtained 
307 indictments and 200 convictions involving sampl fraud thornburgh 
said 
thornburgh has been criticized in congress for failing to bring 
indictments against many former executives suspected of stealing 
from thrifts 
but he predicted it would take at least five years for the 
justice department to investigate and prosecute remaining cases of 
sampl fraud 
last month former vernon savings and loan association owner 
donald r dixon was indicted on 38 conspiracy and fraud counts in 
the billiondollar collapse of his thrift in 1987 dixon has 
pleaded innocent 
dixon and mcbirney frequently were listed as being among the 
most soughtafter officials of collapsed thrifts 
bob gilliam special agent in charge of the dallas fbi office 
said the increased pace of indictments was the result of manpower 
provided investigators by last years thrift bailout legislation 
youll see the numbers continually increasing gilliam said 
a year from now well really see the impact 
mcbirney 37 appeared before us district judge barefoot 
sanders today to be apprised of the charges against him he was 
released on his own recognizance and faces a july 19 arraignment 
before us district judge robert maloney his attorney paul 
coggins said he would plead innocent when arraigned later 
mcbirney had no immediate comment for reporters 
mcbirney was famed for the exuberant way he celebrated his 
wealth flying friends to hawaii for fishing and las vegas for 
gambling dressing as a king at a 1984 halloween party where guests 
dined on pheasant antelope and lion 
the indictment accuses mcbirney of hiding from regulators 
agreements with western savings association over the partial 
financing of 700 million worth of property in southern california 
fbi agent pat dorsey said the deal contributed to the collapse 
of sunbelt in 1988 
the 17 counts involve one transaction mcbirney is accused of 
ensuring western savings a 6 million profit on the sale of a 
property of its choosing in return for western providing 30 
million in financing on california property being bought by sun 
cal a sunbelt subsidiary 
the charges against mcbirney include bank fraud misapplication 
of funds false entries and making false statements to regulators 
he faces to up 85 years in prison and a 425 million fine if 
convicted 
coggins said the indictment is a typical case of government 
overkill he said mcbirney would show he acted in the best 
interests of sunbelt 
this case shows the great lengths to which people went to 
deceive regulators us attorney marvin collins of dallas told 
reporters in washington he said sunbelts was largest sampl bailout 
thus far 
thirteen other sunbelt officials borrowers and accountants have 
been convicted as a result of the 2year investigation of the 
failed thrift 
sunbelt and western both based in dallas were among eight 
insolvent thrifts taken over by the government in 1988 in one of 
the largest of the efforts to rescue failing institutions 
mcbirney who bought sunbelt in 1982 was forced out by 
regulators in 1986 since then he has been chairman of a company 
dealing in waste treatment technology 
under mcbirneys guidance the association engaged in 
highrisk loans that were either unsecured or inadequately secured 
by commercial real estate the government said in 1988 when it 
finally closed the institution in a bailout estimated at least 25 
billion

morris sultan knew the competition would be 
tough when he decided to look for a new job so he tried something 
novel 
instead of writing a resume he made a video 
in a threeminute pitch sent out to a dozen prospective 
employers sultan detailed why he should be hired one firm liked 
what they saw and brought sultan in for an interview he now 
oversees customs and merchandise orders for mampl design an 
accessory importing firm in new york 
communication is a big part of what i do so i felt like i 
might have a better chance if they could get to know me usually 
they just take your number and say well call you the tape 
helped me get noticed sultan said 
the newwave resumes are a nice calling card to start out 
with that can give candidates an edge on the competition said 
albert dabah who runs video portfolios where sultan made his tape 
but critics call video resumes a gimmick that fosters 
discrimination and gives stressedout job seekers more to fret over 
the rare person maybe in advertising or something can come 
across as a dynamo most people look like a jerk on videotape 
said kathryn troutman who owns the resume place in washington 
dc which still specializes in traditional paper resumes 
most people dont like the way they look in photographs let 
alone on camera she said 
if someone tried to put me on a tape id say hey im 
trying to look for a job here not get myself depressed theres 
already enough trauma involved with looking for a job this is just 
an extra aggravation she said 
since the tapes give prospective employers a way to view job 
seekers appearance critics say they make age or race 
discrimination too easy and give employers a way to weed out people 
whose appearance they dont find appealing 
but william brown who owns an annapolis md firm where job 
seekers pay 149 for a package that includes a video resume said 
they dont give employers any more of a chance to discriminate than 
personal interviews 
we cant control discrimination if a person comes in theres 
nothing to prevent me from saying hey shes a blonde my 
exwifes a blonde and im not hiring a blonde brown said he 
conceded the tapes save employers time by allowing them to laser 
through candidates 
if someone cant take 10 minutes for a haircut or time to tuck 
their shirt in why would you want to waste your time on them 
said brown who founded network employment amp resume inc five years 
ago 
serouya morey the owner of mampl design said sultans video 
resume was the first hed ever seen 
it struck me as a little innovative and this job takes some 
creativity morey said the tape gave him a chance to judge 
sultans personality and make decisions you cant get from 
reading a resume morey said 
the bottom line is he probably got the job because of it 
morey said 
at browns office clients already prepped on what to wear sit 
in front of a picture of the manhattan skyline brown with his 
back to the camera asks them questions that might come up in any 
job interview clients talk about their current job and what 
theyre looking for in their next post 
tapes containing several fiveminute interviews with people 
looking for the same type of jobs are then sent to a network of 
corporate clients brown is developing brown declined to provide 
the names of his clients 
steven klein of target search a washington headhunting firm 
called the tapes a gimmick people are using to make money job 
candidates lose out by trying to sell themselves on video rather 
than in person he said 
a lot of it is chemistry it either clicks or it doesnt with 
a video you never get a chance to go eyeball to eyeball klein 
said 
peter cushley who handles video and advertising for browns 
firm writes off the competitions criticism 
if youre selling super widgets is a guy selling widgets 
going to tell you super widgets are better cushley said

interest in hammers art collection

alleges fraud legal malpractice and financial misconduct it 
contends hammer and a law firm representing the industrialist 
repeatedly deceived frances hammer about her ownership rights to

joan weiss mrs weiss is a niece of frances hammer and sole heir 
to her estate mrs hammer died in december after 33 years of

waiving her interest in his art collection which has been 
estimated to be worth 450 million 
richard c cleary a lawyer for the weisses said those signings 
were part of the pattern of fraud and deceit the suit also says

foundation lewis overbeck and furman a chicago law firm and the 
armand hammer museum of art and cultural center in los angeles 
where hammers art collection is to be housed 
the lawsuit was the fourth filed in connection with the museum 
which is under construction beside occidentals headquarters 
the others were filed by occidental shareholders seeking to halt 
the companys involvement with the museum occidental has committed 
about 100 million to building and endowing the facility money

corn and soybean futures prices fell thursday on 
the chicago board of trade while wheat futures rose slightly ahead 
of a government report that was expected to contain a lower winter 
wheat crop estimate 
analysts attributed some of the activity to positionsquaring 
ahead of the agriculture department crop report traders expected 
the usda to reduce its winter wheat harvest projection to about 
205 billion bushels from last months estimate of 209 billion 
according to one survey 
in the report which was released after the close the usda 
lowered the winter wheat production estimate to 204 billion 
bushels 
the report did not contain production estimates for corn or 
soybeans 
the corn and soybean markets were mainly influenced by forecasts 
for continued mild temperatures and adequate rainfall in the 
midwest through the end of next week 
the weather in the corn belt has been so fine for crop 
production that you could arguably state that yield potential has 
improved said richard feltes commodity research director with 
refco inc in chicago 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 307 a bushel corn futures 
were 1 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 276 a bushel oats 
were 4 cents lower to 1 cent higher with july at 126 a bushel 
soybeans were 4 cents lower to 1 cent higher with july at 607 a 
bushel

cashstrapped donald j trump tried to avoid 
more financial problems thursday at a civil lawsuit that alleges he 
defrauded a union pension fund by using undocumented polish workers 
to raze a building to make way for the trump tower 
trump tried to distance himself from the accusation by saying he 
did not directly supervise the 1980 project and did not know the 
contractor had used polish workers until after the job was done 
he also said repeatedly during his 90minute appearance that he 
could not remember specific events and conversations 
trumps court appearance took place amid reports he is suffering 
from a severe cash crunch caused by the enormous debt on his 
casinos and real estate properties 
trump made a passing reference his financial problems when 
plaintiff attorney wendy sloan asked whether he generally read 
newspaper articles about his projects 
lately its become almost impossible because of the volume 
he said 
if he loses this case trump could have yet another debt to pay 
the lawsuit seeks more than 1 million in unpaid contributions and 
interest for the union pension fund 
the multimillionaire developer and landlord was subpoenaed by 
the plaintiff a retired demolition worker who was a member of the 
house wreckers union to testify at the nonjury trial in 
manhattans federal court 
the lawsuit charges that trump conspired with union officials to 
defraud the pension fund by failing to make contributions on behalf 
of 200 illegal polish aliens who worked on the job 
the complaint also names the equitable life assurance society 
trumps partner in the demolition project 
trump said he probably visited the site on fifth avenue between 
56th and 57th streets but did not enter the old bonwit teller 
building that was being razed 
you have to be very brave to walk into a building under 
demolition and im not sure im that brave he said 
trump said he might have been aware that workers had lodged 
complaints about not being paid but he placed the blame on the 
contractor william kaszycki whom he described as a disaster to 
put it mildly who could not handle the job 
in life you make mistakes and this was a mistake he said 
trump said he did not learn until sometime after the demolition 
project was completed that polish workers were used he said he 
still does not know whether they were illegal aliens 
his testimony was frequently interrupted by his attorney milton 
gould who objected that certain questions were irrelevant on one 
occasion gould muttered this case is nonsense 
during one line of inquiry trump acknowledged that he on 
occasion had used the pen name john barron but us district 
judge charles stewart stopped sloan from asking more questions on 
the subject

today inspired by visions of easier credit conditions 
much of the gain came after chairman alan greenspan of the 
federal reserve board indicated that the fed was ready to relax its 
monetary policy if it proved necessary to counter a squeeze in 
availability of bank credit 
greenspans comments to the senate banking committee were seen 
as a departure from his recent position that weakness in the 
economy did not warrant any immediate change in fed policy 
though analysts differed as to how much the feds views might 
have changed the news was warmly received in the credit markets 
sending interest rates lower

president bush gave congressional leaders his 
personal review thursday of the nato and economic summits winning 
praise for going slowly on soviet aid and quickly on fighting farm 
subsidies 
however one congressman said the history of farm supports in 
this country suggests they will live forever 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated the president 
had not yet called soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to fill 
him in on the summit 
bush said wednesday he had sent gorbachev a cable indicating the 
results were positive as far as the soviet desires went and 
planned to call him in a few days 
bush back in the white house froma week of summitry on two 
continents met first with his cabinet which greeted him with 
applause 
then joined by his secretaries of state defense and treasury 
bush gave more than a dozen top democrat and republican lawmakers a 
rundown on the london and houston summits 
it was basically upbeat rep dante fascell dfla 
chairman of the house foreign affairs committee said of the 
briefing 
fascell said the united states had accomplished what it set 
out to do in london in revising the western alliances military 
strategy and showing that the soviets need not fear nato 
house speaker thomas s foley said the economic summit which 
concluded wednesday in houston made some progress there are 
still obviously some unresolved issues with respect to trade 
but in general i think it was a successful outcome 
on the question of soviet aid foley said the president 
reiterated his belief that additional economic reforms are 
necessary i can only say that i dont dispute the presidents 
statement at this time 
bush kept a low profile thursday ignoring reporters questions 
on wednesday night however flying home from houston he said 
were very satisfied with both events weve got a lot of work to 
do now but they went well 
the united states won a commitment from its six economic summit 
partners and the european community to revive the general agreement 
on tariff and trade talks by trying to find ways to cut farm 
subsidies 
bush also withstood pressure from west germany and france for 
coordinated western aid in response to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs appeal for help 
rep bill archer of texas the top republican on the ways and 
means committee said bush was eminently correct on the soviet 
aid question 
he was almost alone in that and ultimately i think 
negotiated a good arrangement said archer who represents bushs 
adopted home town of houston 
were not ready to just jump in there with massive 
economic aid before the soviets move closer to a marketoriented 
economy fascell said 
bush also said in houston he will ask congress to dismantle us 
farm subsidies if other countries agree to lower their barriers 
asked if congress would buy that fascell said if you follow 
the history of farm price supports in this country its been very 
difficult to conclude anything except that farm subsidies will live 
forever 
fascell said there was no question the subsidies should be 
reduced but added we dont want to destroy our agriculture in 
the process 
foley said there is great reluctance on the part of our 
trading partners to dismantle their subsidies 
the european subsidies go far beyond anything the us does 
with respect to agriculture the speaker said 
the bush administration says such subsidies should be eliminated 
because they skew international trading and cost taxpayers and 
consumers billions of dollars in government payments and higher 
food costs

last week hj heinz co announced it was opting out of 
pennsylvanias antitakeover law making the food manufacturer the 
latest company to voluntarily give up the protections offered by 
the new statute 
states increasingly are offering corporations more protection 
from hostile threats but faced with growing shareholder activism 
and other considerations some companies would rather tough it out 
on their own 
we dont need the protection we will live on our 
performance said bob pugliese westinghouse electric corps 
executive vice president for legal and corporate affairs 
the pennsylvania legislature passed the antitakeover law 
considered the nations toughest last spring after to an unwanted 
foray against armstrong world industries inc by canadas belzberg 
family 
armstrong welcomed the bill but other pennsylvaniachartered 
companies including westinghouse and heinz began to take 
advantage of a 90day period during which they could opt out of any 
or all of its provisions 
david h gunning a partner with the law firm jones day reavis 
amp pogue in cleveland said corporate managers have had to weigh the 
advantages and disadvantages of accepting the laws provisions 
he described the dilemma if i opt out of it i havent gotten 
the added protection but i havent gotten the more immediate 
problem of more active shareholders 
shareholders particularly big pension funds dont like 
antitakeover laws that have been enacted in recent years because 
they perceive the statutes as barriers to higher stock prices 
shares of companies considered to be vulnerable to takeover 
frequently shoot higher on speculation or when an actual bid is 
made 
some of the big shareholders campaigned against the new law the 
california public employees retirement system the nations largest 
public pension fund urged pennsylvania corporations to opt out 
many companies complied with the request realizing theyre 
going to deter investors from acquiring shares in the company 
said william tyson professor of legal studies at the wharton 
school of the university of pennsylvania 
westinghouses pugliese said we dont want them to have a 
disincentive to invest in westinghouse 
new takeover defenses continue being enacted although the 
merger wave of the late 1980s continues to recede the takeover 
business has slowed as financing has become more scarce but this 
does not mean us corporations are safe from hostile bids 
especially if financing becomes easier to obtain 
there will come a time when money is going to become 
available again gunning said these statutes will probably 
serve as inhibitions to some acquisitions in some place 
stat antitakeover laws have flourished since 1987 that year 
the supreme court upheld indianas antitakeover statute in a 
ruling that recognized the states rights to develop corporate 
defenses against hostile bidders 
the indiana law gave shareholders the right to decide whether an 
investor who buys a big stake in a company even a majority 
interest could vote those shares in corporate elections the law 
known as a controlshare statute has been copied in other states 
antitakeover laws also have been evolving more than half the 
states have adopted merger moratorium statutes which generally 
prevent a hostile acquiror from taking control of a companys 
assets for several years without the approval of a specific 
percentage of shareholders 
such laws were aimed at raiders who sought to pay for 
debtfinanced takeovers by breaking up a target company and selling 
it piece by piece 
the pennsylvania statute has both controlshare and merger 
moratorium provisions and contains a provision that disarms 
corporate raiders under the law a raider is forced to return any 
profits made after announcing a buyout bid that is intended solely 
to drive up the companys stock price or set off a bidding war 
westinghouse and heinz opted out of all the provisions 
tyson said states continue passing takeover laws with new 
embellishments partly because many believe the indianastyle 
control share laws arent strong enough 
furthermore he said the trend seems to be getting stronger 
because the courts seem to be supporting these takeover statutes 
and upholding their constitutionality 
judges themselves continue to craft takeover defenses in may 
the delaware chancery court continued its inclination toward giving 
boards of directors leeway in defending against unwanted bids 
the court said the board of apple bancorp inc which is facing 
an unwanted bid did not violate a duty to shareholders by delaying 
setting a date for its annual meeting where suitor stanley stahl 
was threatening a proxy fight 
delaware court decisions are watched closely because many of the 
nations biggest companies are incorporated in the state

six months after the federatedallied 
department store empire plunged into the biggest retailing 
bankruptcy case in history it still hasnt produced a plan to 
repay 77 billion in debts reorganize and survive 
but suppliers and creditors dont seem overly concerned and 
some are optimistic about the future of the stores which span some 
of the bestknown names in retailing including bloomingdales 
jordan marsh and the bon marche 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp the 
retailing divisions of the campeau corp in toronto are still 
bleeding substantial amounts of money 
both lost nearly 100 million in the first full quarter under 
federal bankruptcy protection last week they reported a combined 
loss of 269 million in may alone 
nonetheless they said the may loss was smaller than expected 
and four of their nine chains recorded operating profits for the 
month seattlebased the bon marche reported the largest profit 
39 million 
from every indication we see they are on the right track and 
we are going to support them in every way we can said bernard 
chaus president of clothing supplier bernard chaus inc 
chaus said he plans to ship the stores merchandise worth 30 
million to 40 million this year thats an indication of faith 
among many suppliers that the department stores will emerge 
successfully from their financial problems 
a federal bankruptcy court has twice granted federated and 
allied extensions on their deadline to submit a plan to reorganize 
giving them until sept 12 after that date creditors can propose 
their own plans 
the retailers say they plan to ask judge j vincent aug for at 
least one more extension at a hearing later this month 
federated and allied sought protection from creditors jan 15 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code the biggestever 
bankruptcy case in the retail industry the move gives them a 
respite while they devise a plan to pay the bills and emerge as 
healthy businesses 
the retailers had been struggling to repay enormous debts that 
accrued from campeaus takeover of allied in 1986 and of federated 
in 1988 much of the debt was in risky highyield junk bonds 
that developer robert campeau sold to finance his companys 
expansion in the united states 
the stores themselves have remained largely healthy despite 
pockets of weakness in the retailing industry for that reason 
some creditors have asked why the stores should remain in 
bankruptcy court refuge at all since it is the parent company that 
was mostly responsible for the crippling debts 
the court protection has delayed major decisions on expansion 
plans and financing arrangements lewis s rosenbloom a lawyer for 
the retailers major suppliers said such protection could be 
costly for the stores 
the next major step in the case will be for federated and allied 
to propose a plan to run the businesses in reorganization 
spokeswoman carol sanger said the plan is due by late summer or 
early autumn 
i think until we see the companies business plan later this 
summer it is difficult even to begin negotiating over 
reorganization said lawyer joseph f kelly who represents 
holders of 12 billion in federated and allied junk bonds 
while creditors await a reorganization plan the decision to 
appoint federated veteran allen i questrom chairman and chief 
executive officer has reassured some suppliers 
questrom considered one of the nations best retailers was 
hired away from dallasbased neimanmarcus in february he had 
spent 23 years in federated divisions before resigning in 1988 
questrom is implementing new marketing strategies and cutting 
out unprofitable segments of private label clothing brands said 
thomas tashjian a retail industry analyst for seidler amdec 
securities inc 
as long as the losses remain reasonable within a wide range of 
expectations i dont think the figures are really an issue i 
really think the reassessment of strategy is more important 
tashjian said and i expect them to emerge from chapter 11 as a 
very strong vibrant competitor in the department store business

on the economy that the federal reserve would have to consider 
offsetting using monetary policy he said 
lower us interest rates would tend to reduce returns on 
dollardenominated investments and curb demand for dollars

office in new york said as the session progressed traders began to 
view greenspans comments more skeptically which may have aided 
the recovery in the dollar

might ease monetary policy and didnt declare that it would do so

the stock market charged to record highs 
thursday with the dow jones industrial average hitting a new peak 
in trading sparked by visions of lower interest rates 
the dow average of 30 bluechip industrial stocks jumped 3713 
to 296980 giving it a gain of 7896 points in the last two 
trading sessions that carried the average past its previous 
closing peak of 293589 reached june 15 
broader market indicators also showed strong gains with nearly 
two stocks rising for every one that declined on the new york stock 
exchange 
much of the rally came after federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan indicated the central bank was ready to relax its 
monetary policy if necessary to counter a squeeze in the 
availability of bank credit 
that could mean lower interest rates which would help ease 
pressure on corporate profits 
greenspans comments to the senate banking committee were seen 
as a departure from his recent position that weakness in the 
economy did not warrant any immediate change in fed policy 
brokers also said buyers apparently were encouraged by the 
markets steady recent showing despite a succession of 
disappointing midyear corporate earnings reports

marcelo gumucio president and chief 
operating officer of cray research inc on thursday resigned from 
both positions at the supercomputer maker 
cray chairman and chief executive officer john a rollwagen said 
for the foreseeable future he will assume gumucios 
responsibilities in addition to retaining his titles of chairman 
and chief executive officer 
rollwagen said in a letter to employees that he and gumucio 
were unable to agree on implementing a longrange strategy for 
the company 
we attempted to blend our distinct management styles 
effectively but were not successful in that effort rollwagen 
said the decision to part is mutual and in the best overall 
interests of the organization and the individuals involved 
gumucio who also resigned from the cray board of directors did 
not return a phone call thursday he joined the company in 1983 as 
executive vice president of marketing becoming president in 1988 
it boils down to a style difference maybe not even a 
personality difference rollwagen said in an interview after the 
announcement 
my style is somewhat more intuitive and informal whereas 
marcelo is more structured and more formal thats one way to try 
to put a handle on it neither style is right nor wrong both 
styles have worked very effectively in a lot of companies 
including ours 
the problem is from trying to marry two styles at top of the 
company rollwagen said 
rollwagen emphasized there was no disagreement with gumucio over 
longrange strategies the company has been developing absolutely 
not we have full agreement on strategy he said 
at the companys annual meeting in may gumucio said cray 
planned to continue expanding its line of supercomputers in the 
1990s he said the companys introduction of a new smaller 
supercomputer was an example of how the company was developing 
outward from its original focus on the most powerful computers 
cray now is refocused on a variety of products to fit the 
growing world of computer networking he said then 
cray suffered a slump in 1989 with sales up just 4 percent to 
7847 million and earnings declining 43 percent to 89 million 
in april however cray reported its firstquarter profit 
totaled 95 million compared with 15 million for the same 
period in 1989 the company also said it expected an increase in 
profit for the year 
analyst gary smaby president of the minneapolisbased smaby 
group said he met with rollwagen and gumucio after the 
announcement thursday 
my sense is the differences were stylistic differences he 
said there was no particular event or issue that caused them to 
reach this decision it built up over a period of years 
the change should be a positive one for cray smaby said 
any time conflicts are resolved it bodes well for the health 
of the enterprise it helps people focus on the work at hand he 
said 
smaby said gumucio told him he had not yet decided on his future 
plans and did not have another job lined up

nilson said 
diebold is the only major supplier of atms that wasnt tied 
into complete banking computer systems he said in a telephone 
interview ncr can practically give away the machines as long as 
they sell the whole system 
ibm benefits because its atms are not as competitive as those of 
the market leaders he said 
ibm the worlds largest computer maker ranked eighth in bank 
machine shipments worldwide last year and atms represent a tiny 
fraction of its overall sales nilson said 
fujitsu ltd of japan was second in worldwide atm shipments 
after ncr but most of its sales were in japan diebold was a close 
third nilson said 
diebolds stock rose on the news gaining 137 to close at 
4587 in new york stock exchange trading ibm shares closed at

abroad the companies said 
no dollar value was placed on the deal 
diebold based in canton ohio will own a majority of the joint 
venture international business machines corp based in armonk 
ny will hold the remainder the companies said nilson said he 
believed diebolds stake was 70 percent 
robert p barone diebolds president and chief operating 
officer has been named chief executive officer of the venture 
diebold and ibm will continue to manufacture their existing atm 
products under agreements with the joint venture but the venture 
will own the manufacturing rights to the products the companies 
said 
the venture which will be based in canton is expected to begin 
operations later this year the company will have its own name but 
it has not yet been decided diebold spokeswoman mary ann jackson 
said its products eventually will bear this name the companies 
said 
the company will have about 500 employees coming from both 
diebold and ibm ms jackson said 
robert w mahoney diebolds chairman and chief executive said 
in an interview that his company views the venture as a way to 
increase its international business diebold currently conducts 
most of its international sales through outside distributors 
in addition mahoney said we wanted a partner that could 
bring very significant things to the table in terms of research and 
development 
for ibm the venture represents another move in its strategy of 
combining its resources with those of other companies to reduce 
development costs ibm is involved in joint computer chip research 
with siemens ag of west germany and in cooperative software 
development with other companies 
diebold which also makes corporate security systems earned 
362 million on revenue of 4689 million last year about 12

energy futures prices surged higher thursday 
amid reports that saudi arabia the biggest member of opec was 
willing to accept a lower production quota to help rein in the 
cartels output 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for august 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude oil soared 99 cents to 1846 a 42gallon barrel after

three days this week 
reports that the saudis were willing to temporarily accept a 
production ceiling lower than their current 2446 percent stake of 
opecs output sent prices soaring 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries has been 
unable to persuade its members to lower their output and this has 
depressed oil prices 
but the report about the saudi agreement meant they would be 
willing to be a swing producer and this was viewed as very bullish 
for the market said andrew lebow a broker at edampf man 
international futures inc 
traders got a further impetus to buy from reports that the 
united arab emirates another opec member has agreed to a quota of 
15 million barrels of crude a day the united arab emirates have 
consistently violated their quota 
opec officials have been meeting in hopes of reaching some 
agreements prior to a gathering of the full cartel on july 25

japans trade minister visited one of the 
major machinetool manufacturing regions of the united states on 
thursday and proposed a dialogue possibly leading up to joint 
ventures in the industry 
kabun muto touring cincinnati after attending the houston 
economic summit said the proposal was part of his plan to send a 
mission to the united states in september to ease trade tensions 
and promote us exports to japan 
muto head of the powerful ministry of international trade and 
industry spoke to an audience of about 250 at a luncheon sponsored 
by the greater cincinnati chamber of commerce 
his appearance was considered symbolically important since the 
cincinnati area is a bastion of american manufacturing and its 
machinetool industry has been hurt by foreign competition in 
recent years 
the audience included procter amp gamble co vice president durk 
i jager who heads the companys international operations and 
executives of japanese businesses operating in ohio 
muto said that his emissaries hope to start a dialogue 
consisting of american machine tool and parts makers and 
japanese users and makers to exchange opinions on procurements and 
establishing such longterm cooperative relationships as joint 
ventures 
muto gave no details but the plan appeared to be part of a much 
broader agreement reached last month by japan and the united states 
on ways to open japans markets alleviate the huge us trade 
deficit with the japanese and make american products more 
competitive 
although it is true that the trade imbalance between the 
united states and japan stands at nearly 50 billion this is not 
because japan is trying to hamper imports from the united states 
muto said japan is certainly not forcibly exporting it is 
merely selling products that are demanded by the us market 
earlier muto told a news conference at procter amp gambles 
headquarters that usjapanese relations should be based on 
cooperation in international economic development 
his comments reflected the sentiment in a statement issued 
wednesday at the end of the threeday summit of the worlds leading 
industrialized democracies they pledged liberalized trade with the 
soviet union and eastern europe

southmark corps former top officers caused the 
collapse of the real estate concern and then concealed its failing 
financial condition with the help of outside auditors a 
courtappointed examiner charged 
examiner neal batson said in a report filed last friday that 
dallasbased southmark which is operating under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code should pursue claims against former 
chairman gene phillips and former vice chairman william friedman to 
recover a portion of an estimated 15 billion in losses the 
company allegedly suffered during their eightyear tenure 
batson also urged southmark to investigate a severance agreement 
reached last year between the company and former officers 
at the recommendation of the examiner southmarks creditors 
committee last month filed suit against phillips and friedman 
seeking to recover roughly 68 million in payments and rights 
surrendered to the officers 
the report also advised the company to take legal action against 
grant thornton southmarks outside auditor from the early 1980s 
until 1988 batson wrote that grants improper accounting was 
key to maintaining the illusion that southmark was a growing and 
profitable company even as it slid toward insolvency 
in a statement grant thornton denied any wrongdoing 
concluding that southmark was insolvent by december 1987 the 
examiner tried in the report to explain how the 9 billion company 
saw its net worth wiped out with one quarters losses and wound up 
in bankruptcy court struggling to repay 1 billion in junk bonds 
with stock of doubtful value and 644 million in cash 
the story of southmarks rise and fall involved its ability to 
create the illusion of success and prosperity that deceived the 
investing public with a selfportrait of everincreasing profits 
assets and net worth batson wrote in the report the last to 
arise from his investigation into the prebankruptcy affairs of the 
company 
the southmark story is one of unsound acquisitions overvalued 
assets illusory sales phantom profits hidden liabilities 
insider deals and outsider cronyism resulting in a sea of red 
ink he said 
attorneys for phillips and friedman who said they hadnt yet 
seen the independent examiners latest report criticized its 
general findings 
henry simon one of the mens bankruptcy lawyers said all 
highly leveraged real estate companies in texas suffered the same 
fate as southmark and that the states real estate crash not 
mismanagement was responsible for southmarks woes 
so far theres no one who has received a business achievement 
award for doing highly leveraged deals simon said

with the report charging the findings are supported neither by 
generally accepted accounting principles nor generally accepted 
auditing standards

extremely vigorous it said its audit resulted in a 200 
million loss for fiscal 1988 in place of the 6 million profit

failure it said southmark did not fail because of its 
auditor grant will not allow itself to be made a scapegoat and 
will defend itself vigorously

interest after the company went public a year later 
under the terms of the proposal accor said it had agreed to 
make a tender offer of 2250 per share in cash for the more than

a south korean union sued a us company 
in federal court thursday alleging breach of contract for shutting 
down its south korean factory and withholding 1 million in wages 
from workers 
an attorney for the union said the lawsuit was the first in 
federal court by foreign workers seeking to settle a labor 
disagreement 
the lawsuit filed in us district court accuses pico products 
inc of suddenly closing its pico korea ltd factory in buchun city 
in february 1989 to avoid compliance with a collective bargaining 
agreement 
the union is seeking more than 1 million in back wages and 
severance it claims is owed to 294 workers employed by pico korea 
a wholly owned subsidiary of pico a liverpool nybased maker of 
cable television components 
in the united states must a worker sue her boss to receive 
her paycheck union president jum soon yoo said through an 
interpreter 
yoo and a dozen other supporters ended a weeklong hunger strike 
with the filing of the lawsuit 
yoo and two other union leaders came to the united states in 
april to get pico chairman bernard hitchcock to negotiate a 
settlement after failing to resolve the dispute in their homeland 
hitchcock has refused to negotiate with the union 
at a news conference thursday hitchcock repeated claims that 
union representatives are terrorists who kidnapped a company 
management team ransacked the factory and seized its contents and 
extorted unreasonable contract concessions 
they ripped us off for 2 million and stole the company im 
through with these people were now in court and im happy with 
that hitchcock said 
during their threemonth stay in the united states the union 
leaders and a growing number of supporters have picketed picos 
headquarters regularly 
last weekend they protested outside hitchcocks home in 
syracuse hitchcock responded by standing on his roof and dousing 
the demonstrators with water from a garden hose 
frank e deale legal director of the center for constitutional 
rights in new york city which is representing the south korean 
union said the lawsuit was filed on the basis of two federal laws 
they are the labor management relations act which gives federal 
courts jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements and 
the 1988 worker adjustment retraining and notification act which 
entitles all workers employed by american corporations to 60day 
notice of plant closings 
deale said the lawsuit would test whether that law can apply to 
employees of a us corporation who work abroad 
the union charged that pico korea took full advantage of its 
status as a foreign firm and enjoyed tax breaks and other benefits 
offered by the south korean government 
the company grew rapidly after it opened in march 1983 the 
workers mobilized in june 1988 to form a union in response to what 
they called unsafe working conditions and subminimum wages 
the union and company reached a labor accord in november 1988 
that excluded the issue of wages which was to be settled through 
future talks according to the lawsuit 
but before those talks could begin hitchcock fired pico koreas 
top officers and ordered the plant shut down the lawsuit alleged 
union members admitted seizing the plant on feb 28 1989 and 
refusing to allow shipment of finished products but said they did 
so to force negotiations 
yoo said the union brought the lawsuit because the south korean 
and american governments were ignoring the crimes of 
multinational firms against third world workers

fisherprice toys announced thursday it 
was cutting 720 jobs as it struggles amid weak sales mounting 
losses and an expected spinoff from its parent company 
the maker of brightly colored preschool toys said it was laying 
off 245 employees at its upstate new york headquarters and closing 
a nearby plant later this year 
fisherprice in february closed its plant in east aurora where 
the company was founded 60 years ago 
fisherprice which employs 6500 employees in plants in new 
york kentucky england and on the usmexico border has lost 
445 million in the last 15 months company president ronald j 
jackson said fisherprice sales dipped to 700 million in fiscal 
1990 from 849 million the previous year 
he said the latest layoffs werent necessarily related to the 
scheduled spinoff in early 1991 of fisherprice from its current 
owner quaker oats co of chicago 
whether youre a part of quaker oats or a public company you 
just cant go forward losing money he said i think these cuts 
would be made whether it was part of quaker or whether it was 
independent 
fisherprice said it was closing its plant in holland which was 
built in 1962 and employs about 475 workers between september and 
november because it is the companys oldest facility 
the cutbacks at its headquarters where the company will retain 
a work force of about 950 employees involve all phases of the 
operation including marketing research and development 
operations and engineering 
david leibowitz a toy industry analyst with american securities 
corp said the layoffs are designed to get fisherprice into 
fighting trim before the spinoff from quaker oats 
these are very hard things to do but the reality is if this 
company goes independent early next year and does not have a strong 
parent to fall back on during hard times they have to be able to 
stand on their own two feet he said 
jackson who just joined the company seven weeks ago said 
company executives had been enthusiastic about the reception 
fisherprices products received at the annual toy fair the 
company had promised no further layoffs in upstate new york 
by the time they got to april and saw the business trends 
our products just werent doing as well as wed hoped he said 
he said most of fisherprices losses can be attributed to the 
companys decision within the past 10 years to branch out from its 
traditionally strong infant and preschool product lines 
the promotion line of toys was aimed at and marketed to children 
between the ages of 5 and 12 had only initial success and the 
company has withdrawn from that line jackson said 
he said fisherprice would refocus on infant and preschool 
products

the securities and exchange commission on 
thursday charged the troubled colorado penny stock brokerage 
blinder robinson amp co of overcharging investors by more than 20 
million in 21 months 
according to a lawsuit filed in us district court blinder 
robinson marked up prices as high as 140 percent on penny stocks 
when selling them to investors 
sec attorney stephen j crimmins said companies are permitted to 
mark up prices as much as 10 percent as commission for conducting 
transactions but they must notify buyers if they charge more than 
that he said blinder did not 
the sec complaint said the alleged illegal activity took place 
from june 1985 through february 1987 with some occurring in 
pennsylvania 
in april the sec suspended blinder robinson from trading in 
penny stocks for 45 days and from underwriting such offerings for 
two years the sec also barred the firms founder and chairman 
meyer blinder from associating with and registered brokerdealer 
for at least two years 
blinder 69 of denver colo and four associates were indicted 
in february on racketeering and securities fraud charges by a 
federal grand jury in las vegas the indictment followed a 1988 
internal revenue service raid on blinder robinsons denver office 
blinder robinson once was the nations largest penny stock 
brokerage 
penny stocks are low cost high risk securities usually trading 
for less than 3 per share they are not listed on stock exchanges 
and typically are used to raise capital for new or small companies 
the lack or reliable information about penny stocks has made them 
prone to fraud 
the complaint charged that of more than 1 billion shares of 
penny stocks in 12 companies blinder robinson sold to customers 
997 percent were marked up by over 10 percent of the prevailing 
market price 
blinder robinson general counsel kalmon glovin said the lawsuit 
appeared to be a rehashing of old allegations by the sec which 
blinder robinson and meyer blinder have been and are being 
vigorously defended against in other litigation 
glovin said the sec was relentless in trying to justify 
systematic destruction of blinder robinson and the 
professional career of its founder meyer blinder under the guise 
of protecting the public interest 
the philadelphia lawsuit also charges that blinder robinson bid 
for and purchased stocks at the same time it was distributing them 
to customers crimmins said the practice is considered legal if a 
firm informs buyers but blinder robinson did not 
the sec also charges that the firm dominated the market in the 
12 stocks accounting for over 86 percent of all interdealer and 
retail trading activity a practice which resulted in essentially 
giving the company complete control of the price of the stocks 
the sec seeks permanent injunctions against the alleged illegal 
practices crimmins declined to say whether other federal agencies 
would pursue criminal charges against the company or its officers 
intercontinental enterprises inc the englewood colo 
corporation that owns blinder robinson also is named in the suit 
along with blinder robinson and meyer blinder

federal express corp said thursday that 
profits rose 53 percent in its fourth quarter but slumped for the 
full year in large part because of the acquisition of tiger 
international 
earnings for the quarter were 431 million or 81 cents a 
share up from 4097 million or 78 cents a share in the same 
1989 period revenue rose 147 percent to 19 billion from 17 
billion 
for the fiscal year ending may 31 profits fell 305 percent to 
116 million or 218 a share from 185 million or 318 a share 
in fiscal 1989 revenue rose to 7 billion from 52 billion 
federal express spokesman dan copp said the annual decline in 
earnings was due largely to increased debt resulting from the 
acquisition in february of tiger international a los angelesbased 
air cargo carrier 
copp said the companys net interest expense more than doubled 
in fiscal 1989 to 188 million due to the purchase of tiger 
international and was the primary reason for the earnings decline 
federal express longterm debt increased to more than 2 
billion from about 75 million a year because of the acquisition of 
tiger international 
federal express chief executive frederick w smith also cited 
international expansion disappointing air freight volumes and 
expansions at major hub facilities in anchorage and indianapolis 
also contributed to the earnings result 
federal express is the worlds largest air delivery service
