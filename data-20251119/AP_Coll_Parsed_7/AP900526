us members of the mount everest international 
peace climb returned home friday after placing 20 climbers on the 
summit of the worlds highest peak 
expedition leader jim whittaker said placing american soviet 
and chinese mountaineers side by side on the summit was a model for 
the superpowers to emulate 
we have a bond that will never stop said whittaker who in 
1963 became the first american to reach the top of everest 
my proudest moment was when we put the first group on the 
summit to have that vision become a reality was a wonderful 
moment 
the first of the 20 climbers reached the 29028foot summit on 
may 7 and were followed by the others over the next few days 
tibetans who assisted in the climb also reached the summit 
previously the record number of climbers to reach the top of 
everest with a single expedition was 17 
the climbers said they collected about two tons of garbage while 
on the mountain from previous expeditions as well as their own 
some was buried some was burned and some was carried off the 
mountain to be recycled in china said dan branley a spokesman for 
the climb 
the expedition which began in february cost more than 1 
million it was being paid for by us corporate sponsors 
including the ll bean camping gear company of freeport maine

two activists for a radical environmental 
group were arrested friday in connection with a bomb blast that 
ripped their car apart but the duo and their supporters painted 
them as victims not criminals 
the evidence is strong they were transporting this device and 
thats why they were arrested said oakland police lt mike sims 
at a friday news conference 
based on our determination of the placement of the device in 
the car we believe they should have known it was there we believe 
it went off accidently 
but in an interview from his jail cell darryl cherney who was 
arrested along with judi bari hotly denied carrying any explosive 
devices and insisted that police investigate who was trying to kill 
the pair 
we are demanding that the oakland police department 
and the fbi seek out this assassin and bring whoever it is to 
justice immediately said cherney 33 describing himself and 
bari as victims 
baris attorney susan jordan said her client also denied any 
involvement with explosives during a meeting at baris hospital 
bedsise 
bari 40 required surgery at highland hospital for a fractured 
pelvis and suffered other injuries and was in listed stable 
condition friday cherney who suffered minor injuries including a 
head cut was treated and released thursday night 
the two earth first supporters were being held for 
investigation of possession and transportation of explosives 
cherney was booked into city jail and bari was under guard at the 
hospital 
jordan said that its inconceiveable that they would destroy 
their movement by doing that its always easy to charge somebody 
whos unpopular 
jordan added if you had a bomb wouldnt you be careful 
enough not to place it where it could injure you 
the bomb exploded on an oakland street just before noon thursday 
as bari and cherney were driving to a rally at the university of 
californiasanta cruz 
the blast blew out the windows and the rear drivers side door 
of baris station wagon other doors were blown open and the roof 
was bowed upward 
i dont believe it said mark huntington a friend of the 
pair and an earth first supporter if the police produced 
evidence and put it on tv i still wouldnt believe it i think 
they planted it the fbi has a lot of reasons to get rid of 
darryl and judi 
about 30 supporters of earth first on friday maintained a vigil 
outside police department headquarters in downtown oakland vowing 
not to leave until cherney and bari were freed 
some in the crowd played guitars and held signs reading stop 
blaming the victim trees not bombs and the fbi did it 
as many as 200 supporters gathered outside the police station 
friday night wearing earth first tshirts and singing folk songs 
sims said authorities served three search warrants and found 
evidence in several places that led to the arrests thursday night 
police searched cherneys van and a berkeley house occupied by 
several members of another environmentalist group seeds of peace 
bari and cherney had visited the house wednesday night and 
cherneys van was parked outside 
the pair described by friends as dedicated pacifists were key 
figures in planning mississippi summer in the california 
redwoods an environmentalist effort to halt what they describe 
as excessive logging of oldgrowth timber in northern california 
both were in the san francisco bay area to drum up support for 
the summerlong campaign 
the effort patterned after the mississippi summer civil 
rights protests that drew thousands of college students to the 
south in 1964 has heightened tensions along the northern 
california coast where environmentalists and the logging industry 
have long been at odds 
although bari and cherneys supporters said the two activists 
are committed to nonviolent change earth first has become known 
for tactics that include sabotage and vandalism including tree 
spiking driving spikes into soontobeharvested trees to 
damage logging equipment 
daniel barron an earth first organizer from san francisco 
said about a dozen people have received anonymous death threats 
such as one that was signed committee for the death of earth 
first 
one threat included a picture of bari with the cross hairs of a 
rifle sight drawn across her face said betty ball of the mendocino 
environmental center 
but environmentalists have not been the only targets at 
louisianapacific lumber co spokesman shepard tucker said a pipe 
bomb exploded two weeks ago at a mill in cloverdale an 
investigation into that incident is continuing said the sonoma 
county sheriffs department

the state department is raising the 
possibility that romania may be denied us trade benefits because 
of electoral irregularities both during the campaign and on 
election day 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the issue of 
granting romania most favored nation trade status is under review 
as a result of the alleged abuses 
that status would entitle romania to have the lowest possible 
tariff rates for its us exports the late president nicolae 
ceausescu renounced the trade benefits two years ago because of 
insistent us demands for the protection of human rights as the 
price for continuation of these privileges 
according to some estimates ceausescus action cost romania 
250 million yearly in us exports 
romania receives no us economic assistance but an 80 million 
food aid program was began earlier this year 
official returns from last sundays election showed that acting 
president ion iliescu won 85 percent of the vote and that 
candidates from his national salvation front won almost 68 percent 
in the balloting for the bicameral legislature 
the front has been in charge of romania since the communist 
regime was ousted last december its candidates consist mostly of 
former communists who had a falling out with ceausescu 
ms tutwiler said serious distortions during the campaign 
included organized acts of intimidation and violence directed 
primarily against the opposition candidates and their 
sympathizers 
in addition she said the front had virtually unrestricted use 
of government resources for campaign purposes opposition parties 
meanwhile did not have equitable access to public television and 
were prevented from having reliable delivery of their campaign 
literature 
as for election day irregularities ms tutwiler said there were 
instances of inadequate physical control over ballot boxes 
inappropriate assistance to some voters inside the voting booth 
and questions over the status of certain printed ballots and voter 
identity cards 
she accused the romanian government of failing to take 
sufficiently vigorous steps to remedy the distortions or to 
discourage acts of intimidation and violence 
on the other hand she said that the overwhelming number of 
romanians were able to cast their ballots without visible coercion 
we lack substantiating evidence that these voting day 
irregularities were of sufficient weight to have altered the 
outcome of the elections she said

huge trucks with double or triple trailers 
could make driving more dangerous if allowed to spread to more of 
americas highways a new private group says 
we have good cause to be afraid of these rigs gerald 
donaldson a board member of citizens for reliable and safe 
highways said friday what the trucking industry wants is 
everincreasing size of trucks and everincreasing weight of 
trucks 
leaders of the group abbreviated as crash announced its 
founding at an outdoor news conference with a 100foot 
tripletrailer truck placed in front of the capitol dome as a 
backdrop 
the american trucking association in a statement said it is 
not now seeking federal legislation to allow more widespread use of 
very long trucks with triple trailers or two 48foot trailers 
they currently are restricted to certain highways in 13 western 
states 
the association said crash was making an attempt to cloak the 
rational discussion of trucking productivity in manufactured safety 
hysteria 
it said crash was inspired and funded at least indirectly 
by the railroads which it said were trying to prevent increases 
in trucking productivity and to enact unfair burdensome truck 
taxes 
paul loveday vice president of itel corp which owns and 
leases railroad boxcars told the crash news conference that his 
company gave 150000 to get the organization started 
other directors include former california gov edmund g pat 
brown former transportation secretary john volpe and joan 
claybrook former administrator of the national highway traffic 
safety administration 
if you look down the list of our board of directors i dont 
think youll see anyone on that list whos a tool of industry 
loveday said 
a statement distributed by crash said studies found double and 
tripletrailer trucks were more likely to be involved in crashes 
the trucking association said transportation department statistics 
found bigger trucks to be as safe or safer than normal trucks 
claybrook said the group would try to influence the highway bill 
congress is expected to draft next year 
she said crash also would push for stricter controls on drivers 
who use drugs or alcohol laws requiring devices on trucks to 
record their speed and hours of operation automatically and rules 
to get poorly maintained trucks off the road

president bush says he will use next 
weeks summit with soviet president mikhail gorbachev to make the 
case for keeping germany in nato 
the president vacationing at his family compound at this 
oceanfront resort late friday night signed a 4 billion spending 
package that includes 720 million in emergency aid for panama and 
nicaragua 
the measure finally passed congress in the wee hours friday 
morning bush signed it at 1019 pm after an air force jet rushed 
it to pease air force base in new hampshire and it was driven to 
his home here 
the president did so despite misgivings about what the white 
house regards as porkbarrel addons by congress and concerns about 
restrictions on his ability to enter into international agreements 
affecting nato 
in a statement bush said the 720 million will help restore 
peace and support the emerging democracies in panama and 
nicaragua but he expressed regret that the congress has used 
this important legislation to enact many special interest 
provisions that are not in response to dire emergencies 
he also criticized congress for cutting 2 billion from defense 
programs to offset about half of the 4 billionplus cost of the 
spending bill 
in a presummit interview with french television bush said it 
is not his problem whether gorbachev is being hemmed in on arms 
control and troop cutbacks by the soviet high command 
i gather hes in pretty strong control now but facing 
enormous problems bush said in the interview thursday the white 
house released a transcript friday 
but its not my role to figure out whether gorbachev is having 
a problem with his right or his left its mine to deal with whats 
on the table and whats on the table is a strong soviet leader 
clearly in charge with whom we have a lot of business items he 
said 
i will approach him and make my case for a united germany in 
nato he said 
in moscow on friday gorbachev said after meeting with french 
president francois mitterrand that if the west insists on making 
germany a member of the western military alliance he would be 
forced to take a fresh look at its polities on arms control and 
european security 
the white house declined comment on gorbachevs warning 
spokesman doug davidson said 
bush hit the golf links with weekend guest transportation 
secretary sam skinner shortly after arriving friday he was 
expected to spend today jogging playing tennis boating and 
getting in another 18 holes 
bush had called the presidents of panama and nicaragua before 
leaving washington on friday to assure them help soon would be on 
its way 
the measure he signed provides 420 million for panama 
rebuilding after us economic sanctions and an invasion of 
american forces last december to topple manuel antonio noriega 
nicaraguas new government led by usbacked president violeta 
chamorro will receive 300 million 
the spending bill includes 12 billion needed to make up a 
shortfall in food stamp funds for the current fiscal year which 
ends sept 30 545 million for veterans benefits 166 million for 
head start 432 million for fighting forest fires 110 million 
for the census and 33 million for nasa 
it also includes 75 million to meet refugee needs around the 
world 45 million in antinarcotics aid to bolivia and peru 30 
million for aid to caribbean countries and 30 million for africa 
the final version dropped 10 million that the senate wanted to 
spend to build a new us embassy in lithuania 
bush complained the legislation would infringe upon my 
constitutional authority over the conduct of diplomacy by 
requiring him to give congress 30 days notice of agreements 
involving nato he said he would regard those provisions as merely 
advisory 
bush who will not return to the white house until monday had 
no special presummit briefings planned his chief of staff john 
sununu national security adviser brent scowcroft and press 
secretary marlin fitzwater did not even accompany him to maine 
in addition to skinner and his wife honey the bushes weekend 
guests included houston friends charles and sally neblett and son 
marvin bush his wife margaret and their children marshall and 
walker

mayor marion barry says hes ready to go to 
trial now that a judge refuses to drop the drug and perjury charges 
against him or to throw out medical and videotaped evidence that he 
allegedly used drugs 
defense attorneys argued on friday that the government engaged 
in prosecutorial vindictiveness by bringing six new drug charges 
against the mayor may 10 they also argued that the government 
engaged in impermissible conduct by having a cooperating government 
witness lure barry to the vista hotel on jan 18 where he 
allegedly smoked crack cocaine 
the mayor unsuccessfully sought to have the 14 criminal charges 
against him dismissed and videotape and hair sample evidence 
against him suppressed 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson ruled that 
there was no evidence of vindictiveness he also ruled that barrys 
actions at the vista were voluntary and not coerced by the 
government 
defense r kenneth mundy used statements by a cardiologist to 
suggest that the fbi had endangered barrys life by setting up the 
sting operation 
but no violence occurred and no coercion was employed said 
jackson 
the judge did order the government to provide barry with a list 
of the alleged coconspirators and the times and places of the 
alleged cocaine possessions 
jackson also gave barry until tuesday to decide whether to seek 
a separation of the six charges brought may 10 which would result 
in a second trial at a later date 
a june 4 trial is scheduled on 10 counts of cocaine possession 
one count of conspiracy and three felony charges of lying to a 
federal grand jury 
i feel very good about today barry said after the day of 
pretrial courtroom arguments which he attended were ready to 
go to trial 
the judge said the videotape of the hotel bedroom was lawfully 
obtained with the permission of the hotel rooms occupant exmodel 
rasheeda moore 
mundy said a hair sample taken from barry after his arrest at 
the vista hotel should be excluded it tested positive for cocaine 
residue 
mundy said the residue could be from someone else and that so 
far its not a crime to be in a room where another person uses 
cocaine 
but the presence of cocaine in body specimens indicates 
relatively recent ingestion of a substance said jackson and 
may permit an inference of both a present familiarity and a 
willingness to be using it again 
jackson said he will reserve a ruling on whether the hair sample 
will be admissible evidence at trial

had his left arm slashed by an unknown assailant no arrests were 
made

announced at a news conference that grealis was free of aids the 
florist posted his clean bill of health on the shop window 
but on thursday prosecutor bill forbes disputed the mans 
accusations and said he may have wounded himself carrie webster a 
spokeswoman for the state attorney generals office said the case 
is being investigated 
grealis who still contends that several of the attacks were 
real could not be reached for comment friday officials at the 
hospital where he is staying said they would not let him speak with 
reporters 
rosalie morris 51 who works at faschek super market in 
campbells creek said many outsiders were unfairly basing their 
opinions of the entire town on the incident

here she said its like anywhere else theres good and bad 
people

against grealis if the doctor really proves him sick

contra rebels broke off disarmament 
talks friday accusing the sandinistadominated army of killing 14 
disarmed guerrillas and 100 civilians in northern nicaragua 
the conservative government of violeta barrios de chamorro 
which succeeded the leftist sandinista administration a month ago 
but left sandinistas in charge of the military promised to look 
into the report 
contra commander oscar sobalvarro and other rebel leaders issued 
a communique initially charging that five disarmed contras were 
killed and nine others were missing after a may 18 army massacre 
near waslala in matagalpa province 150 miles northeast of managua 
defense ministry spokesman carlos lara called the charges 
totally false 
a rebel delegation raised the later charges of 14 contra and 100 
civilian dead in a friday night meeting with the government said 
roberto ferrey one of the government representatives 
if the charges bear out the government is prepared to order 
an exhaustive investigation and punishment sanctioning whoever 
turns out to be responsible said ferrey 
he said mrs chamorro ordered an onsite investigation with the 
participation of cardinal miguel obando y bravo 
the rebels learned of the incident thursday the same day that 
disarmament talks with the government got under way sobalvarro 
said in a news conference 
the talks with the government are suspended indefinitely 
until the incident is investigated and those guilty of the massacre 
of the demobilized rebels are punished the contra commander said 
lara branded the charges part of a contra propaganda campaign 
aimed at creating mistrust and insecurity among those who are 
trying to demobilize and disarm according to agreements with the 
government 
a may 4 agreement between contras and the government set a june 
10 deadline for 11000 rebels to give up their weapons 
but the contra high command suspended disarmament on may 19 and 
fewer than 1500 fighters have been demobilized to date 
sovalbarro said friday the high command will continue to 
withhold orders for disarmament 
the contras backed by the united states fought the leftist 
sandinista government in a 10year war that left 30000 dead 
rebel fighters said they would give up their arms when mrs 
chamorro backed by the united states took over the presidency 
from sandinista president daniel ortega on april 25 
but the high command changed its mind saying its troops were 
not receiving enough food housing jobs and security measures from 
the government 
the contras say their chief concern is the threat of the army 
which is controlled mostly by sandinistas

defense secretary dick cheney plans to shuffle 
millions of dollars among the pentagons accounts to keep as many 
as 68000 of its employees from losing their jobs 
traditionally the defense secretary would make such a move with 
the consent of key members of congress but cheney says he plans to 
go ahead with this regardless of whether all the necessary 
lawmakers agree 
we want to protect military personnel from the effects of 
shortages in the manpower accounts he said friday last fall 
congress said it expected us to pursue this kind of reprogramming 
and thats what ive been trying to do for the past five months 
the pentagon has asked for authority to move 852 million from 
other accounts to avoid the dismissal of military personnel by 
october such a shift of funds from one pocket to another is known 
in washington jargon as a reprogramming 
such shifts of money are customarily submitted to the chairmen 
and ranking minority members of the house and senate armed services 
committees and the corresponding appropriations defense 
subcommittees 
the pentagon has estimated that without the reprogramming 
authority 44100 to 68200 military personnel would have to be 
fired by oct 1 between 32000 and 36000 people would be frozen 
in their current jobs 57000 to 67000 promotions would be 
delayed and 59000 to 115900 fewer men and women could be brought 
into the armed forces 
cheney said he has the agreement of seven of the eight 
lawmakers with only rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house

this is no supermarket tabloid its the cover 
of life magazine thirteen years after the death of elvis presley 
new evidence points to an inescapable conclusion suicide 
the king of rock n roll rumored to be alive ever since his 
august 1977 death actually killed himself with a massive drug 
overdose presleys controversial biographer claimed friday 
writer albert goldmans story for life is based in part on 
information from elvis stepbrother who was among the first to see 
presleys body after the singer died in his memphis mansion 
graceland 
its the dream gone to nightmare its perfect its the 
archetypal rags to riches to rot story goldman said as advance 
copies of his magazine cover story were released to the media 
a private autopsy conducted following presleys death put the 
cause of death as a heart attack through years of rumors about his 
death including some saying elvis staged his own funeral the 
presley estate has stuck with that finding 
a phone call to graceland for comment on goldmans claim from 
the presley estate was not returned 
goldman stunned and infuriated millions of presley fans around 
the world with his 1981 biography elvis which portrayed the 
king as an obese impotent drug addict incapable of taking care of 
himself another unflattering goldman biography the lives of 
john lennon had the same effect on his fans 
in elvis goldman asserted that presley had died of an 
accidental overdose but he said subsequent conversations with 
david stanley elvis stepbrother and a fixture at graceland 
convinced him that presley committed suicide 
stanley says he knew all along it was a selfinflicted death 
but he had trouble accepting it 
i was willing to protect elvis as far as last year but with 
the constant bombardment of elvis is alive stories i came to the 
conclusion that the best way to deal with things was reality 
stanley said friday at a news conference at the time amp life 
building 
the day he died elvis had consumed three packets of assorted 
drugs at once along with some codeine the doses were usually 
spread out over eight hours stanley said 
goldman points to elvis physical deterioration his drug 
addiction and his depression over a tellall book written by 
exbodyguards red and sonny west with steve dunleavy as three 
factors in the alleged suicide 
dunleavy a reporter for foxs a current affair called the 
allegations absolute garbage in an episode of the program that 
aired friday 
goldman said presley had also attempted suicide once before on 
the eve of his marriage to priscilla beaulieu 
stanley himself a recovering drug addict said that two days 
before elvis death the king indicated that he was not much longer 
for this world 
he stood up in his bed and started hugging me and crying 
then he told me david im never going to see you again the next 
time we meet will be in a different place stanley recalled 
goldman said stanleys story prompted more research and he 
quickly became convinced elvis had killed himself i began to 
see uhoh boy youve got the last 18 months wrong because this 
guy was threequarters dead before he blew out the flame 
robert pondiscio a spokesman for life said the magazines 
editors did not believe it was necessary to take extraordinary 
steps to verify goldmans research because of his background as the 
singers biographer routine factchecking was done he said 
albert goldman is elvis biographer of record for better or 
worse pondiscio said this is the type of story that cant be 
ignored

reform judaism one of the three major jewish 
branches in the united states is considering lifting ageold 
barriers against ordaining homosexuals as rabbis 
but homosexual rabbis would be warned about dangers of making 
their sexual preference public 
reform judaism with 15 million members nationwide would be 
the first us jewish branch to take allow homosexual rabbis 
adoption of the new ordination guidelines would go against 
traditional jewish emphasis on procreation and aversion to 
homosexuality dating to prebiblical times 
the proposal was drafted by a 17member committee of the central 
conference of american rabbis representing the nations 1560 
reform rabbis after four years of study hearings and debate 
rabbi joseph b glaser the conferences executive vice 
president said friday he expects the proposal to be approved 
during the groups convention june 2428 in seattle 
its a wellbalanced statement finely tuned and sensitive to 
our concerns he said it sets a middle ground approving 
ordination of homosexuals in a roundabout way 
we ordain people who are qualified and decent and were saying 
if they happen to be gay its not any business of ours were not 
making an issue of it were saying its not an issue 
the proposal urges that all rabbis regardless of sexual 
orientation be accorded the opportunity to fulfill their sacred 
vocation which they have chosen 
but rabbis who are homosexual would be cautioned about making 
their orientation public as it can have grave professional 
consequences 
the unique position of the rabbi as spiritual leader and 
judaic role model make the acceptance of gay or lesbian rabbis an 
intensely emotional and potentially divisive issue the proposal 
said 
glaser said there was an ancient and basic jewish abhorrence 
of homosexuality derived from judaisms emphasis on procreation 
and perpetuating the human seed 
that was the first commandment he noted citing gods 
injunction in the book of genesis to be fruitful and multiply 
something impossible in homosexual unions 
the conservative wing of us judaism with 1300 rabbis and 15 
million followers advised reform colleagues against the new stand 
the orthodox branch representing an estimated 1 million followers 
also strongly condemns homosexuality 
an estimated 2 million american jews are not affiliated with any 
of the three branches of us judaism 
the proposed reform policy says 
all human beings are created betselem elohim in the divine 
image their personhood must therefore be accorded full dignity 
sexual orientation is irrelevant to the human worth of a person 
the proposed new stand is based on a recently announced 
admissions policy of reform judaisms hebrew union collegejewish 
institute of religion of cincinnati and new york 
glaser said there probably are quite a lot of homosexuals 
already in the ministry as rabbis ministers and priests 
citing scientific uncertainty about the origins of all 
homosexuality the statement says there are some people for whom 
heterosexual monogamous procreative marriage is not a viable 
option or possibility 
it adds the majority of the committee reaffirms unequivocally 
the centrality of monogamous heterosexual procreative marriage and 
its special status as kiddushin sanctified marriage 
therefore in the case of a person for whom sexual identity is 
a matter of choice the majority of the committee affirms that 
heterosexuality is the only appropriate jewish choice 
a committee minority maintained that even where choice is 
possible homosexual relationships are equally legitimate and 
that the relationship not the gender of people should determine 
its jewish value

a commodities dealer was ordered to pay 2 
million for destroying 86 acres of wetlands on his hunting retreat 
and in what the judge called restitution for birds was barred 
from hunting wild fowl 
the penalties were the largest financial sanctions ever levied 
against a person in an environmental criminal case assistant us 
attorney jane barrett said 
multimillionaire investment counselor paul tudor jones ii 35 
pleaded guilty friday in us district court to one misdemeanor 
count of violating the clean water act for filling in the wetlands 
on his maryland property with 1400 cubic yards of gravel without a 
permit 
under a plea bargain jones was fined 1 million ordered to pay 
1 million in restitution to the national fish and wildlife 
foundation and ordered to restore the 86 acres he destroyed 
barrett said 
us district judge frederick smalkin also banned jones from 
hunting migratory birds anywhere in the united states through 1991 
he was placed on 18 months probation and restricted from developing 
2500 acres of his 3272acre estate 
jones faced up to one year in prison 
wetlands are considered crucial to the health of chesapeake bay 
because they filter pollutants and provide habitat for wildlife 
the message this sends is clear that those who destroy 
wetlands will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law that 
is very good news for the chesapeake bay and other coastal 
waters said william baker president of the chesapeake bay 
foundation 
in a statement friday jones said the problem arose because he 
had gotten erroneous advice 
we believed in error that our experts had properly addressed 
the complex issues related to habitat development in wetlands he 
said 
breckinridge l willcox the us attorney for maryland said 
the case is the largest wetlands case ever filed in the united 
states 
jones bought the waterfront estate now valued at 20 million 
in august 1987 barrett said the property included 1742 acres of 
marshlands and wetlands at the time 
the property is northwest of the black water national wildlife 
refuge a sanctuary for geese and duck and home to one of the 
states largest populations of bald eagles 
prosecutors said jones was warned repeatedly in 1987 by his own 
consultant gregg moore to stop work at the site until he received 
permits from the army corps of engineers 
the corps told the project manager william ellen in february 
1988 after inspecting the site twice to stop filling in the 
wetlands until a permit was obtained according to court documents 
ellen 44 of matthews va was indicted friday on six counts 
of violating the clean water act for filling the wetlands at tudor 
farms without permits and one count of violating the rivers and 
harbors act by placing fill material in navigable waters without a 
permit the us attorneys office said 
jones owns tudor investment corp which deals in commodities 
and financial futures trading he topped financial world magazines 
1988 list of the 100 highestpaid people in the investment 
business with earnings of 80 million to 100 million in 1987 he 
reportedly made another 30 million in 1988

the federal government wants ohios national 
guard to return the 2 million it allegedly overcharged the army 
and to pay some 64 million in penalties and damages 
in a rare lawsuit filed against the state the justice 
department said ohio routinely knowingly mischarged and 
overcharged the national guard bureau for the costs of labor 
through several different fraudulent practices 
the 84 million lawsuit filed under the false claims act 
accuses the ohio state government of overcharging the armys 
national guard bureau for the costs of labor utilities and 
materials at camp perry in northwest ohio 
under the law the federal government may seek treble damages 
in this case 6 million for alleged overcharges the suit also 
seeks 24 million in penalties for 229 alleged instances of false 
claims between 1980 and 1987 
the false claims act is commonly used against private 
contractors for overbilling the government for goods and services 
its use against a state government is extremely rare justice 
department spokesman michael robinson said on friday 
brig gen thomas schulte an assistant adjutant general of the 
ohio national guard said i havent seen the complaint so i 
cant comment well have our attorneys take a look at that and go 
from there 
maj gen richard c alexander adjutant general of the ohio 
national guard declined to comment directly on the suit but said 
the guard had reached a settlement with the army in 1988 
a defense contract audit agency audit had a finding 
against us of 41 million in disallowed costs going back to 
1978 alexander said friday night 
rather than take the matter legally we were suggested to 
informally settle with the army we did that there was an 
agreement to pay the federal government 1 million over a fiveyear 
period dcaa made no move and the justice department came in 
d michael crites us attorney for the southern district of 
ohio said friday night that the army has no authority to settle 
cases involving the false claims act 
this suit is a necessary action to ensure that the government 
and in turn the taxpayers get what they pay for said stuart m 
gerson assistant attorney general for the civil division 
among other things the lawsuit accuses ohio of billing the 
national guard bureau 315568 between 1981 and 1987 for the costs 
of annual rifle matches that were staged by the armys director of 
civilian marksmanship 
in spite of the fact that the state knew that these costs had 
been billed to or were to be billed to the director of civilian 
marksmanship the state submitted vouchers for the same costs to 
the national guard bureau said the complaint filed in federal 
court in columbus 
the national guard bureau was charged 315568 between 1981 and 
1987 for expenses that were also paid by the director of civilian 
marksmanship the complaint alleged 
the lawsuit also accuses ohio of mischarging or overcharging the 
pentagon 498500 worth of labor costs between 1978 and 1987 
the state charged the national guard bureau for the overtime of 
federal workers it had assigned to perform tasks unrelated to the 
armys use of the camp 
the suit also charges that the state billed the national guard 
bureau 270666 for fuel oil and electricity for heating buildings 
that were not used by the army

a photo exhibit by the late robert 
mapplethorpe was ending its sevenweek run today at an art gallery 
that was indicted for displaying it 
more than 75000 visitors viewed the perfect moment a 
display of 175 photos at the contemporary arts center 
five of the photos depicted homosexual acts and two showed 
frontal nudity of children prompting a hamilton county grand jury 
to indict the gallery and its director dennis barrie on 
misdemeanor obscenity charges last month 
the case remains unresolved judge david j albanese of hamilton 
county municipal court has yet to rule on pretrial issues 
including what evidence may be admitted in the trial and whether 
the grand jury received proper instructions from prosecutors 
the indictments fueled public interest in the exhibit lines 
during the last week at the arts center were long as usual robert 
brasier a gallery attendant collecting admission fees said the 
museum had more than 4600 patrons thursday and friday 
this is like the first day brasier said friday 
even before it reached cincinnati the mapplethorpe exhibit 
prompted a national debate over freedom of artistic expression the 
hamilton county indictments were the first criminal charges brought 
in the dispute however 
cincinnati has become a microcosm of what is happening all 
over america barrie said 
in june sen jesse helms rnc showed copies of the most 
controversial photographs from the perfect moment to members of 
congress and the corcoran gallery in washington dc canceled 
its showing of the exhibit 
but the exhibit was show in six other cities without incident 
in cincinnati the exhibit had a preview showing april 6 for 
arts center members when it opened for the public the next day 
spectators included the grand jury and police temporarily closed 
the gallery to videotape the photographs 
us district judge carl rubin issued a temporary restraining 
order april 8 barring lawenforcement officials from closing the 
exhibit until the obscenity question was resolved in court 
the exhibit now goes to the boston institute of contemporary 
art where it is to open aug 1 institute director david ross said

striptease dancing may be bad art but no matter 
how the dancers remove their clothes theyre still covered by the 
constitution a federal appeals court ruled 
the decision released friday by the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals found that indiana cannot use a statute banning public 
indecency to prohibit nude dancing in taverns and strip joints 
though this dance is clearly of inferior artistic and 
aesthetic quality as contrasted with a classic ballet as the dance 
of the seven veils in strauss salome the erotic message 
communicated to the viewers is present in both performances said 
judge joel flaum who wrote the majority opinion in the 74 
decision 
indiana authorities had not argued that the dancing was obscene 
and the ruling did not protect forms of dance deemed obscene 
however that strauss salome tells a compelling story and 
the nude dancing at the kitty kat lounge may not is not 
determinative flaum wrote expression does not lose its 
protection for lack of a scripted plot 
three dancers and their employers jrs kitty kat lounge and 
the glen theatre both in south bend had challenged the indiana 
law 
in dissent judge john l coffey said the framers of the 
constitution never intended for the first amendment to protect nude 
dancing 
no less than in the contexts of abortion and other important 
questions of present concern we are required to permit the people 
of each state to establish through their democratically elected 
representatives the moral climate in which they choose to live and 
raise their children coffey wrote 
a spokesman for indiana attorney general linley pearson said the 
decision would likely be appealed to the us supreme court 
our office has been diligent in pursuing states rights 
issues said the spokesman dan foley we feel that community 
standards in indiana are different from places like new york or san 
francisco

in the final days of a long election 
campaign marred by bloody attacks by drug traffickers and leftist 
guerrillas a new wave of bombings and shootings has killed dozens 
of people 
in the latest violence a car bomb blast in a bogota 
neighborhood late friday night seriously injured four people and 
heavily damaged dozens of homes 
a leading presidential candidate in sundays election proposed 
that cocaine be legalized in the united states and other countries 
to wrest profits from drug traffickers 
the legalization of cocaine in the world would resolve the 
problem in colombia alvaro gomez a centerright candidate for 
the national salvation movement told a news conference 
the election frontrunner is cesar gaviria of the governing 
liberal party who says there should be no negotiations with drug 
bosses the other three candidates have proposed at least some kind 
of accommodation with them 
no one immediately claimed reponsibility for the car bombing 
friday night but suspicion fell on drug traffickers blamed for the 
deaths of more than 250 people since august two of three 
assassinations of presidential hopefuls have been blamed on drug 
traffickers 
the aug 18 assassination of thenleading presidential hopeful 
luis carlos galan of the liberal party prompted a crackdown in 
which authorities have extradited drug suspects to the united 
states and seized the property of traffickers 
government officials say the drug barons are apparently stepping 
up their terror attacks to scare people away from the polls on 
sunday the army said this week that leftist guerrillas also aim to 
disrupt the balloting 
since thursday a wave of bombings and murders in the cocaine 
capital of medellin has left 22 people dead and 27 injured eight 
bombs have exploded in colombia in the last two weeks killing a 
total of 34 people and injuring more than 320 
the medellin cocaine cartel has offered 4300 for every police 
officer killed so far this month 33 have been assassinated 
police said 
the army and police said they were mobilizing about 230000 
troops to ensure peaceful elections 
bogota is an armed camp military checkpoints line major streets 
and highways and armored personnel carriers mounted with machine 
guns patrol the cities soldiers are everywhere 
it is difficult to have a conversation with a colombian these 
days without the subject getting around to bombs and other 
terrorist acts 
the violence is keeping people away from public areas and 
overwhelmingly reducing their activities it might also keep people 
at home for the elections camilo castellanos a social 
scientist told the associated press 
a low voter turnout could wrest legitimacy from the winner that 
may be exactly what the perpetrators of the violence are seeking in 
their campaigns to destabilize politics officials say 
the current president virgilio barco is barred by the 
constitution from seeking a second consecutive term 
security concerns have prevented many candidates from appearing 
in public forcing them to conduct their campaigns through 
television and radio 
these are the most tense and difficult elections in colombian 
history antonio navarro the presidential candidate for the 
leftwing m19 party told reporters wednesday 
navarro took over as m19 candidate after his predecessor 
carlos pizarro was murdered in april by an assailant who shot him 
to death on a commercial jetliner over bogota it is unclear 
whether drug traffickers killed him 
the other assassinated presidential candidate was leftist 
bernardo jaramillo who was killed march 22 police said he was 
killed by the medellin cartel 
in medellin five bodies with hands and feet bound were found 
friday on a highway the police spokeswoman said the police have 
not been able to identify the victims 
a 44pound bomb exploded friday morning at an office building in 
a wealthy medellin neighborhood the spokeswoman said three people 
were hurt and nearby apartments and stores were damaged 
she said one of the three assassinated police officers was shot 
to death on her way to work friday morning 
on thursday a powerful car bomb blew up at a police post 
outside the luxury intercontinental hotel killing five people and 
injuring 22 police said three of the dead were police officers 
the police spokeswoman said unidentified attackers also stormed 
a medellin office thursday night fatally shooting three men and 
two women 
that same night four people were murdered elsewhere in the 
city she said 
military spokesman col eduardo arevalo on wednesday said the 
rebel national liberation army on tuesday kidnapped two mayors two 
mayorselect and three city councilmen in the northwestern state 
of antioquia 
the bogota daily newspaper el tiempo citing military sources 
reported this week that the national liberation army and another 
insurgent group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia are 
planning to sabotage presidential elections

former gov george ariyoshi denied a report that 
he accepted a 50000 cash payment from imelda marcos when the 
former philippine first lady visited hawaii in 1982 
in a written statement friday ariyoshi said mrs marcos tried 
to give him cash but he said he returned the money 
i have not done anything wrong and this unfortunate incident 
was not one of my making said ariyoshi who returned here from 
japan on friday 
the los angeles times quoting mrs marcos travel expense logs 
that were entered as evidence at her federal racketeering trial in 
new york last saturday reported that ariyoshi received the payment 
three days after the democrat announced his intention to run for 
reelection 
ariyoshi said he was unable to recall the date but at some 
time some gifts were left at washington place hawaiis 
governors mansion he said 
ariyoshi said he found money in an envelope inside one of the 
packages 
i immediately decided to return it and rewrapped it 
ariyoshi said i did not want to touch the money and i do not 
know how much there was 
ariyoshi said he returned the money to mrs marcos and suggested 
she donate the money to agencies benefiting filipinos in hawaii 
mrs marcos has denied making the payment 
mrs marcos has stated that she never delivered any money to 
gov ariyoshi and thats our position said ben cassiday an 
attorney for mrs marcos if gov ariyoshi has a different 
position thats fine i have no idea of really what hes talking 
about 
mrs marcos is on trial in federal court in new york charged 
with embezzlement and fraud she is accused of helping her late 
husband former philippine president ferdinand marcos steal more 
than 220 million from their countrys treasury 
state records show ariyoshi who served as governor from 1974 to 
1986 did not report a payment from mrs marcos as a campaign 
contribution either way such a large contribution would be 
illegal 
ariyoshis name appears on mrs marcos log in a july 1982 entry 
during a trip mrs marcos made to the soviet union morocco and the 
united states the times said 
on a page listing cash disbursements for july 20 1982 is 
a brief handwritten entry 50000 given to gov ariyoshi 
the times said 
the logs are written in notebooks in which a private secretary 
to mrs marcos identified in testimony as longtime aide fe roa 
gimenez maintained a running account of expenses incurred by mrs 
marcos and her entourage during trips abroad the times said 
ariyoshi now a private attorney is a longtime friend of mrs 
marcos and her husband who died in exile in honolulu in september 
1989 
ariyoshi was at hickam air force base in honolulu to greet the

a un scientific panel has called for drastic 
cuts in emissions that cause global warming saying temperatures 
will otherwise rise faster in the next century than in the past 
10000 years 
the report friday by the respected committee could help shift 
international debate from whether global warming exists to how to 
combat it the united states and japan have been skeptical of the 
phenomenon and reluctant to take action 
global warming is the process by which socalled greenhouse 
gases such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons collect 
on the outer edges of the earths atmosphere and trap heat within 
the emission of some gases must be cut by more than half simply 
to stabilize the situation or the warming will be even faster the 
un report said 
as it is the scientists predicted the overall increase in 
temperatures in the next century will be greater than that of the 
previous 10000 years combined the rising temperatures could cause 
sea levels to rise more than two feeet by the end of the next 
century they said 
the report was one of three being prepared by working groups of 
the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change which called 
on the expertise of about 1000 scientists around the world 
the two other working groups are preparing reports on the 
effects of global warming including dangerous climatic change they 
say will cause rising seas the spread of disease and widespread 
starvation in poor countries 
the three reports will be presented in november at the world 
climate conference in geneva 
the scientists said global temperatures will likely increase 
about 18 degrees fahrenheit in the next 35 years and 54 degrees 
before the end of the next century sea levels were predicted to 
rise by 23 inches each decade that would come to 8 inches by the 
year 2030 and more than two feet by the end of the next century 
martin houlgate a former chief scientist with britains 
environment department said the study suggests that failing to 
take action could be dangerous 
the implications of inaction are far more serious than the 
risks of taking action now and finding that not all our projections 
were sound he said on british broadcasting corp radio 
dan lashoff of the washington dcbased natural resources 
defense council said with the new report the bush administration 
will no longer be able to pick its favorite scientific skeptics 
as an excuse for not reducing us emissions 
the united states has called for more study of global warming 
before it imposes measures to fight it 
after the reports release prime minister margaret thatcher 
urged a giant international effort to deal with the threat she 
pledged britain to reducing projected carbon dioxide emissions by 
30 percent by the year 2005 
but the united nations report said cuts in carbon dioxide 
emissions should be twice as large and must take effect 
immediately 
there must be immediate cuts of more than 60 percent in the 
output of longlived gases carbon dioxide nitrous oxide and 
chlorofluorocarbons to stabilize their concentrations at todays 
levels the scientists said 
means of cutting the emissions include improving energy 
efficiency and substituting natural gas and other clean fuels 
for highcarbon fuels like coal and oil 
other suggested steps included improving public transportation 
and traffic management reducing industrial emissions promoting 
tree planting and discouraging deforestation and providing aid and 
training to developing countries to encourage the use of 
energyefficient technologies 
west germany has proposed a 25 percent reduction in carbon 
dioxide by 2005 the netherlands have agreed to stabilize emissions 
by 1995 france italy denmark and most of the other 12 members of 
the european community favor a proposal that will be discussed at a 
meeting next month to stablize carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 
levels by the year 2000

here are some excerpts from the report by the un 
intergovernmental panel on climate change working group i entitled 
scientific assessment of climate change the executive 
summary of the report was distributed friday by the british 
central office of information 
we are certain of the following 
there is a natural greenhouse effect which already keeps the 
earth warmer than it would otherwise be 
emissions resulting from human activities are substantially 
increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases 
carbon dioxide methane the chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxide 
these increases will enhance the greenhouse effect resulting on 
average in an additional warming of the earths surface 
the main greenhouse gas water vapor will increase in response 
to global warming and further enhance it 
we calculate with confidence that 
some gases are potentially more effective than others at 
changing climate and their relative effectiveness can be 
estimated carbon dioxide has been responsible for over half the 
enhanced greenhouse effect in the past and is likely to remain so 
in the future 
atmospheric concentrations of the longlived gases adjust only 
slowly to changes in emissions continued emissions of these gases 
at present rates would commit us to increased concentrations for 
decades to centuries the longer emissions continue to increase at 
present day rates the greater reductions would have to be for 
concentrations to stabilize at a given level 
the longlived gases would require immediate reductions in 
emissions from human activities of over 60 percent to stabilize 
their concentrations at todays levels methane would require a 
1520 percent reduction 
based on current model results we predict 
under the ipcc businessasusual scenario of emissions of 
greenhouse gases a rate of increase of global mean temperature 
during the next century of about 03 degrees c per decade with an 
uncertainty range of 02 degrees c to 05 degrees c per decade 
this is greater than that seen over the past 10000 years this 
will result in a likely increase in global mean temperature of 
about 1 degree c above the present value by 2025 and 3 degrees c 
before the end of the next century 
the rise will not be steady because of the influence of other 
factors 
that land surfaces warm more rapidly than the ocean and high 
northern latitudes warm more than global mean in winter 
regional climate changes differ from the global mean although 
our confidence in the prediction of the detail of regional changes 
is low 
for example temperature increases in southern europe and 
central north america are predicted to be higher than the global 
mean accompanied on average by reduced summer precipitation and 
soil moisture 
there are less consistent predictions for the tropics and the 
southern hemisphere 
under the ipcc businessasusual emissions scenario an average 
rate of global mean sea level rise of about 6 centimeters per 
decade over the next century with an uncertainty range of 310 
centimeters per decade mainly due to thermal expansion of the 
oceans and the melting of some land ice 
this amounts to a rise of about 20 centimeters in global mean 
sea level by 2030 and 65 centimeters by the end of the century 
there will be significant regional variations 
there are many uncertainties in our predictions particularly 
with regard to the timing magnitude and regional patterns of 
climate change

in canadas first war crimes trial a jury has 
acquitted a man charged with manslaughter and other atrocities 
against thousands of jews in nazioccupied hungary during world war 
ii jewish leaders called for a retrial 
imre finta 77 who had shown little emotion as he sat in the 
prisoners box during the sixmonth trial broke down and cried 
when he heard the verdict friday 
finta had been charged with confinement kidnapping robbery and 
manslaughter in the rounding up and deportation of 8617 jewish 
civilians from hungary in june 1944 
nobody believes finta a nazi he said sobbing after being 
cleared of all charges i love the jewish people my former 
fiancee was jewish 
the ontario supreme court jury of eight women and four men 
returned its verdict following 12 hours of deliberations over two 
days 
the native of hungary finta became a canadian citizen after the 
war and is now retired from the restaurant business in toronto he 
was a captain in the hungarian police when the jews were deported 
identification was a key question at the trial fintas lawyer 
doug christie said there was no proof finta was the uniformed 
officer some witnesses claimed had been giving orders 
the charges alleged finta was in command when the jews were 
rounded up at a brickyard in the village of szeged forced aboard 
squalid boxcars and transported to labor camps in other 
nazioccupied countries 
the simon wiesenthal center of los angeles said in a statement 
that it was deeply disappointed by the acquittal adding it 
hopes that the judicial authorities will proceed with any and all 
appeals open to them in this case 
were in a state of shock said frank dimant of bnai brith 
canada its exceptionally painful to us in light of the rising 
antisemitism internationally and in canada 
dimant executive vicepresident of the group urged canadian 
federal officials to appeal the decision and said his 
organizations lawyers are analyzing legal grounds for a retrial 
in 1986 jules deschenes the former chief justice of quebec 
superior court who headed a government inquiry into war crimes 
said there was evidence to warrant immediate prosecutions against 
at least 20 war crime suspects in canada 
the following year parliament passed its war crimes 
legislation which empowers the government to make retroactive 
warcrime charges in warassociated offenses that occurred in 
another country 
finta was the first person charged under canadas 1987 
legislation on war crimes and crimes against humanity 
the two others charged under canadas war crimes law stephen 
reistetter of st catharines ontario and michael pawlowski of 
renfrew ontario near ottawa have not yet gone to trial 
reistetter 75 is charged with kidnapping and unlawfully 
transporting 3000 jews from nazioccupied czechoslovakia while he 
was a government official during the war 
pawlowski 72 is charged in the 1942 deaths of 490 people in 
byelorussia the western soviet union

a exnazi ss soldier whose 
ultrarightist party was a growing political force until recently 
has quit as party leader because he says extremists have taken over 
franz schoenhuber 66 said after resigning friday that a 
small clique of extremist functionaries existed at top party 
levels and that he was not responsible for recent clashes between 
police and party members 
mainstream politicians in bonn said his decision marks the 
nearcertain demise of one of europes most controversial political 
parties which went from a mushrooming political force to a fringe 
group in disarray 
otto lambsdorff head of chancellor helmut kohls junior 
coalition partners the free democrats said friday the remains 
of this party will soon scatter themselves into the wind 
the republicans main office in munich said schoenhubers former 
deputy johanna grund 56 will replace him until a new chairperson 
is elected 
schoenhuber led the republicans to headspinning fame last year 
championing xenophobic and rightwing platforms to appeal to west 
germans tired of competing with foreigners for scarce jobs and 
housing 
beginning with west berlin in january 1989 the republicans 
scored large gains in state and local elections and also won 72 
percent in last junes elections for the european parliament 
landing schoenhuber a seat there 
the party claimed its membership climbed from 18000 to 26000 
the past year 
but the wind went out of schoenhubers sails after the east 
german revolution last fall and the sudden realization that german 
reunification was no longer just a dream with every mainstream 
party embracing unification the republicans lost much of their 
nationalist appeal 
in recent state elections the republicans mustered less than 2 
percent of the vote they slipped badly in national polls far 
below the 5 percent needed to gain seats in the federal parliament 
in scheduled dec 2 elections 
in recent days schoenhuber repeatedly cautioned that the party 
was heading too far right and was becoming an extremist rightwing 
group his charges drew fire from other party leaders 
schoenhuber said friday he could not take further responsibility 
for the party following clashes between police and party members 
during recent rallies for oct 14 bavarian state parliamentary 
elections he said he himself was withdrawing as a candidate for 
parliament in those elections 
farright political parties in west germany have a history of 
fizzling out unable to sustain strong membership in a nation where 
the nazi past makes the electorate especially sensitive

a small earthquake rattled dishes in 
hurricane authorities said 
no damage was reported in the tremor friday evening measuring 
26 on the richter scale said jim pechmann a research assistant 
professor at the university of utah seismograph stations in salt 
lake city 
pechmann said the earthquake likely was centered along the 
hurricane fault running about seven miles northwest of this small 
town 270 miles south of salt lake city near the utaharizona border 
pechmann said he spoke by telephone with several hurricane 
residents who all reported feeling the quake one woman told him 
that the dishes in her kitchen cabinets rattled 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion and recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number in magnitude means the 
ground motion is 10 times greater an earthquake of 35 magnitude 
can cause slight damage in the local area

investigation friday and found that driver bobby williamson could 
have prevented the accident thursday night that hospitalized eight 
of 46 passengers 
four of the injured passengers were released friday from a 
hospital the remaining four were in stable condition with cuts and 
bruises hospital officials said 
williamson 50 of chicago had told the state highway patrol a 
tractortrailer forced the bus off interstate 80 about two miles 
east of wamsutter on thursday but passengers on the bus told the 
patrolman investigating the accident that williamson was drowsy and 
had been drifting between lanes 
the cause of the accident hadnt been determined by friday 
afternoon but gravley said williamson should have been able to 
control the bus even if he was forced off the road 
we found the accident was preventable and was caused by driver 
error gravley said we had two stories one about the truck 
forcing him off the road and the story that he fell asleep in one 
respect it doesnt matter 
once he went into the median he should have been able to slow 
down and avoid the accident

a former aide to manuel noriega says fidel castro 
plans to turn over taped conversations with a witness in noriegas 
trial that will assist the former panamanian strongman in his 
defense 
maj felipe camargo an intelligence officer who held a variety 
of top positions under noriega made the statements to the miami 
herald from his prison cell in gamboa panama where he has been 
held since the us invasion 
lead defense attorney frank rubino said he had not received any 
transcripts from castro although he said castro provided him with 
defense material during a meeting in cuba 
camargo said castro had taped conversations with jose blandon 
the former noriega aide who broke with his boss in 1988 and later 
testified before congress and to a federal grand jury against 
noriega 
blandon was the chief witness to one important charge in the 
february 1988 drugtrafficking indictment against noriega he said 
castro had mediated a dispute between the colombian cocaine cartel 
and noriega after a raid on a panamanian drug lab that the 
traffickers had paid millions of dollars to protect 
camargo who frequently traveled to cuba on behalf of noriega 
said castro disputes the charge and was sending transcripts to the 
miami defense attorneys to back up his claim 
as a security measure everything was taped camargo said 
fidel showed us that he had transcripts of various conversations 
with blandon he told us they prove that the affair with the 
colombians was never discussed 
after blandon went public with his charges castro added a 
stenographer at all meetings with panamanian officials said 
camargo 
the herald said camargo is believed to be negotiating a plea 
bargain for a reduced sentence in panama on 18 charges of brutality 
against prisoners in exchange for his testimony on behalf of 
noriegas prosecutors 
camargo refused to answer directly whether castro had knowledge 
of the cocaine lab raid dispute but said another highly placed 
cuban manuel pinero head of cubas powerful americas department 
talked to him about the incident 
pinero told me dont get into trouble with the colombians 
they are very powerful people very dangerous people camargo 
said

a judge has struck down a law that 
banned the ku klux klan from wearing masks in public saying the 
group was persecuted for expressing its racist views 
state court judge howard e cook ruled on friday that the 1951 
law prohibiting the use of masks in public violated the first 
amendment and was unconstitutionally vague and broad 
assistant county solicitor david m fuller filed a notice of 
appeal 30 minutes after cook ruled in favor of a klan member who 
had challenged the law by wearing the white headgear during a 
oneman demonstration 
it saddens me because this order if upheld gives protection 
to some groups worthy of it but its going to afford the same 
protection to groups not worthy of it such as the klan fuller 
said 
the ruling would give the klan carte blanche to revert to how 
it operated in the 30s and 40s fuller said 
cook wrote in his decision that anonymity has been permitted 
under the constitution when the group has been subject to 
potential harm to themselves and their family members as well as 
the possibility of losing their jobs and the ability to earn a 
livelihood 
klansman shade miller jr 27 of calhoun was arrested and cited 
for a misdemeanor during the february demonstration he said during 
the trial he wore it because he feared for his safety and his 
familys safety if his klan affiliation were known 
millers attorney michael hauptman criticized the state for 
defending the ban and predicted cooks ruling will hold up on 
appeal 
the statute is clearly unconstitutional the state would be 
better off in spending its resources drafting a constitutional 
statute rather than defending this one hauptman said

pope john paul ii crossed the maltese 
archipelago today and urged the islanders to reject any challenges 
to the roman catholic churchs ban on abortion and other family 
teachings 
on the second day of his pilgrimage here the first ever by a 
pope to malta john paul kept up his theme of reminding the maltese 
of their centurieslong catholic traditions 
the vatican says 989 percent of maltas 350000 people are 
catholic abortion is illegal here and courts do not grant 
divorces 
john paul crossed from malta to gozo the second largest island 
in the archipelago on a 60foot catamaran the trip took him by 
st pauls bay where maltese say the apostle was shipwrecked in 
the year 60 and founded the first christian community on the island 
papal spokesman joaquin navarro said john paul stood on the 
bridge during the 18minute trip across the blue mediterranean 
waters nearly calm except for an occasional whitecap 
celebrating his first mass on malta at a 17thcentury shrine 
dedicated to the virgin mary john paul said that maltese families 
must guard against the challenge posed by rapid development 
like many societies yours is not immune to a kind of 
spiritual disorientation caused by rapid social changes and the 
attraction of value systems and modes of behavior which run counter 
to the deepest convictions which have molded your identity as a 
people john paul said speaking in english 
he called on all those responsible for the public welfare to 
reject as harmful to society everything that would ignore or deny 
gods plan for the family and lessen respect for the gift of human 
life referring to abortion 
about 1000 people jammed into the small square in front of the 
basilica under a scorching sun for the mass 
with a holiday spirit prevailing cannons boomed a noisy salute 
when word reached this town that the pope had docked in gozo 
enthusiastic crowds rushed toward the white popemobile as it 
drove toward the mass site 
the visit comes after a long period of churchstate tension 
under the previous socialist government which ruled from 1971 
until narrowly losing the general election in 1987 
the socialist government barred private schools including 
catholic ones from charging tuition it also ordered the church to 
hand over property it could not prove it owned 
new churchstate accords are being worked out with the present 
nationalist administration 
since arriving in malta on friday afternoon the pope has made 
clear he expects the government to allow the church to play its 
historic leading role on the islands the visit the popes 48th 
foreign tour ends sunday

tens of thousands of whites 
shouted their support for apartheid and white minority rule today 
at a mass gathering to challenge the governments mandate to share 
power with the black majority 
the socalled new south africa of forced integration which 
the government is forcing on us gives us no other choice but to 
defend our rights and our property at all levels of our 
community conservative party leader andries treurnicht told the 
largest proapartheid rally since president fw de klerk came to 
power last year 
the conservative party had predicted up to 100000 whites would 
attend the rally at the voortrekker monument built on a hill 
overlooking pretoria to commemorate the pioneering forefathers of 
the afrikaners who constitue a majority of south africas 5 million 
whites journalists estimated the crowd at between 30000 and 
50000 
treurnicht has called for a petition campaign to gather 1 
million signatures calling for a new white election he says the 
governing national party would lose because white voters were 
misled in last years parliamentary voting about the extent and 
speed of changes de klerk intended to make 
it is an unreasonable government which no longer represents 
the nation which practices fraudulent politics treurnicht told 
the cheering crowd 
he said the conservative party would try to win constitutionally 
as long as such a method was possible but he warned the 
government do not force our people to stand in your path and to 
challenge you to walk over us we are serious there is no boat 
waiting for us in the harbor 
the conservatives hope the signature drive will make de klerk 
reconsider his policies but he cannot be forced to call a new 
election before 1994 
de klerk has freed from prison african national congress leader 
nelson mandela legalized the african national congress and the 
communist party after 30 years of lowlevel guerrilla war ended 
segregation of beaches and hospitals suspended executions reduced 
the influence of the military on national policy and promised 
apartheid would be gone within five years 
treurnicht said the conservative party has nothing against 
people of other races who want to live in their own communities and 
follow their own culture and nationalism he told the crowd their 
fight is with the communists and the anc and denounced de klerk 
for freeing mandela from his life sentence for plotting the 
overthrow of the government 
the anc hates the boer people and the white nation 
treurnicht said they demand our land they reject our right to 
exist he said mandela proceeds to provoke with his threat of 
violent struggle nationalization sanctions and a rejection of any 
notion of a people or a nation in his socialist future vision 
de klerk returned today from a european tour saying he had 
achieved success in explaining the new direction away from 
apartheid and discrimination 
the new south africa is already in the process of being born 
nobody can stop it he said not through mustering of large 
meetings can anybody stop the process of the new south africa 
de klerk was greeted at johannesburgs airport by government 
officials and a multiracial police choir singing a song in zulu and 
english 
one elderly white man stood on the edge of the 1000strong 
airport crowd which had been bused in to greet de klerk the man 
held up a fivefoot white cross and a sign saying god stands up 
for the whites 
the conservatives want to retain whiteminority rule in most of 
south africa contending that whites and blacks are incapable of 
living together because of cultural differences the conservatives 
favor the policy of separate homelands for black tribes and 
separate neighborhoods and public facilities for different races 
living in urban areas 
the national party began establishing the policy in law when it 
came to power in 1948 but government officials now say it is 
impracticable 
choirs sang hymns and nationalist songs to the accompaniment of 
organ music and bugle fanfares about 200 commandos wearing khaki 
uniforms rode on horseback from central pretoria to the 
amphitheater on a hill overlooking the city 
banners on the podium said the white struggle will continue 
and the struggle for a free state has begun 
people wore tshirts saying i love apartheid with love 
represented as a big red heart 
one sign at the back of the audience said hang mandela 
scores of uniformed members of the white supremacist afrikaner 
resistance movement wore guns and swastikalike symbols on their 
khaki uniforms their leader eugene terreblanche was not invited 
to address the rally 
ridiculing treurnichts call for 1 million signatures on a 
petition to force an election terreblanche has called for whites 
to assemble 1 million guns

the navy and independent analysts will conduct 
new tests over the next two weeks in the hopes of determining 
exactly what caused the explosion aboard the uss iowa that claimed 
47 lives 
congress called for the testing and the navy said it would 
comply in light of congressional findings announced on friday 
that lawmakers said cast grave doubt on the navys official 
conclusion that a troubled sailor probably caused the blast a year 
ago 
officials of the general accounting office told members of the 
senate armed services committee on friday that the iowa explosion 
may well have been an accident 
the navy in a report last september concluded that gunners 
mate clayton hartwig probably set off the april 19 1989 explosion 
by inserting a chemical detonator between bags of powder 
the lawyer representing hartwigs family said the navy should 
pay them the same amount it spent on its first investigation more 
than 4 million 
they ought to give the family at least that much to compensate 
for the hell they have put them through kreig brusnahan said 
from his cleveland office 
i am more convinced than ever that we have a legitimate claim 
for intentional and negligent infliction of emotion distress 
against the navy brusnahan said 
brusnahan expects to submit a claim to the navy within 90 days 
the navy will have six months to respond if the claim is rejected 
brusnahan said he will file with the federal courts 
the navys chief of naval operations adm carlisle ah trost 
ordered on friday that vice adm peter heckman take over the 
renewed investigation heckman is director of the navys sea 
systems command which oversees the services naval weapons and 
supervises how ships are run and built 
rear adm richard milligan who supervised the first navy 
inquiry will not be involved in the new investigation and will 
instead remain at his post as a budget director in the navys 
planning and programing office 
the navy and the sandia national laboratories will cooperate on 
the new tests and the navy pledged on friday to make the findings 
of their study public 
in its report to congress the gao cited tests conducted by 
analysts at sandia that indicated that the iowa explosion may have 
been caused by the unintentionally highspeed overramming of 
gunpowder bags this meant the bags might have been rammed too hard 
and too far into the barrel of one of the ships 16inch guns 
congress sought advice from scientists at the sandia lab in 
albuquerque nm because they found fault with the navys initial 
finding that hartwig was most probably responsible for the 
killer blast 
the sandia lab had conducted tests on 8inch guns which 
indicated that when an overram occurred with the gunpowder pellets 
in the bags jumbled from their normal straightacross pattern an 
occurrence that could easily happen analysts said enough 
friction was produced to cause an explosion 
as for the navys theory that a saboteur ignited the explosion 
sandia analysts said forms of some of the chemical constituents of 
the theorized ignitor were either commonly used in the turrets or 
are part of the maritime environment 
the navy in reopening its investigation ordered a halt to any 
firing of 16inch guns aboard the services four battleships 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he expected fridays testimony would expose 
significant shortcomings in the navys investigation and would cast 
grave doubt on the conclusions and that i believe that the 
testimony we have heard has done that and more 
sen john glenn dohio who represents hartwigs home state 
said the navy blamed the seaman because of its inability to find 
other reasons thats wrong the rush to blame hartwig was flat 
wrong 
sen carl levin dmich added the navys conclusion is 
seriously undermined 
but sen john warner of virginia the ranking republican on the 
armed services committee said its far too early to jump to any 
conclusions about a firing system that has worked tens of 
thousands of times since world war ii 
defense secretary dick cheney said he would reserve judgment on 
the new reports until additional investigations are completed 
navy officials did the best job they could now theres new 
evidence new information that warrants reopening the 
investigation cheney said

the government offered a reward to the people 
who brought a mexican doctor to the united states to face charges 
in the slaying of an american drug agent a prosecutor acknowledged 
a us drug enforcement administration spokesman friday also 
admitted for the first time that the government made a 20000 
payment about 10 days after dr humberto alvarez machain was 
captured in mexico to face trial in the 1985 slaying of dea agent 
enrique camarena 
a witness at a federal hearing in los angeles confirmed the 
20000 payment and said the dea has paid an additional 6000 a 
week in expenses since april 8 to the mexicans who abducted the 
doctor for a total of 62000 so far 
another witness dea supervisor hector berrellez testified that 
up to 50000 was authorized for the capture of alvarez he said 
that dea deputy director pete gruden knew of the plan 
the seizure of the doctor from his office in mexico has created 
a rift between the us and mexican governments mexico has 
demanded his return saying his delivery to the united states 
violated its sovereignty 
alvarez a guadalajara gynecologist was arrested april 3 after 
being brought to el paso texas to face charges he administered 
drugs to camarena during the kidnapping torture and murder of the 
drug agent and his pilot 
the lawyer for alvarez argued vehemently for dismissal of the 
charges against him us district judge edward rafeedie asked for 
more legal documentation before he makes a ruling 
this defendant is the third defendant in this case whose 
presence in this country is the result of forcible removal from his 
country rafeedie said 
he apparently was referring to juan ramon matta ballesteros the 
honduran drug dealer detained by us agents after being arrested 
in honduras and sent to the dominican republic and rene martin 
verdugo urquidez handed over to border patrol agents through a 
hole in the fence on the usmexico border 
assistant us attorney william fahey told rafeedie that 
capturing a witness in such a fashion was not frowned upon in 
us courts and that legal precedent would allow the case against 
alvarez to proceed 
rafeedie said he would consider whether the court has a 
supervisory power to punish the government for actions even if 
case law does not make the actions illegal 
there comes a time when the court has to draw the line on this 
type of conduct the judge said 
dea spokesman frank shults in washington denied that the 
government offered a reward or bounty for the people who captured 
machain saying the 20000 payment was for services he said 
it could have covered such things as rental of the plane that flew 
alvarez to el paso texas 
but fahey said clearly the evidence is that a reward was 
offered and that expenses would be reimbursed 
former mexican police officer antonio garate bustamante who is 
wanted by the mexican government testified he paid 20000 in dea 
money to the people who captured alvarez and was continuing to pay 
their expenses 
garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the 
border with the approval of dea officials he said he found friends 
who would take on the job without advance payment 
i told them that no money would be provided up front and they 
would have no assistance from the dea he said whatever they 
were doing they were doing on their own 
testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that 
camarena was tortured and interrogated by drug lords prosecutors 
maintain that alvarez gave camarena drugs to revive him for 
additional torture before his slaying 
the drug lords reportedly were incensed because camarenas 
undercover work had led us and mexican authorities to a desert 
marijuana plantation where they seized 10000 tons of the drug 
worth billions of dollars

former president reagan must cancel a trip to 
europe and limit his activities for several weeks because of 
complications from cancer surgery in 1985 a spokesman said 
but reagan 79 still plans to fly to san francisco next month 
to meet with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev spokesman mark 
weinberg said friday 
several small adhesions have developed in president reagans 
small intestine which his physicians believe are a result of his 
abdominal surgery in 1985 weinberg said 
adhesions often appear after abdominal surgery and are rarely 
serious said zbigniew petrovich a specialist in colorectal cancer 
at the university of southern california when a patient has 
adhesions the exterior wall of the bowels becomes attached to 
another part of the bowel petrovich said 
in extreme cases he said surgery is required when the 
adhesions obstruct the bowel but they are rarely that serious 
petrovich said 
surgery is not now contemplated hospitalization is not now 
contemplated weinberg said 
president reagans physicians have advised him to limit his 
traveling for the next several weeks therefore president and mrs 
reagans trip to europe planned for next month will be 
postponed weinberg said 
he is otherwise in excellent health the spokesman said from 
the reagan office in century city 
reagan was seen by a doctor on friday but weinberg didnt 
discuss any aspect of the visit 
reagan has had several intestinal surgeries in recent years 
on july 13 1985 doctors removed a 2inch cancerous polyp and 
2 feet of reagans intestinal tract six months later reagan had 
three small benign polyps removed from his intestine and six 
months after that two small noncancerous polyps were removed from 
his colon 
reagan underwent prostate surgery in january 1987 six months 
later two small benign polyps were removed from his colon

president roh taewoo today said no 
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory for japans brutal 
colonization of korea but that japans expressions of regret are 
the basis for a new relationship 
roh returned today from a threeday trip to japan during which 
he invited emperor akihito to make the first japanese imperial 
visit to south korea 
the invitation came after akihito expressed regret for the 
colonization of korea nearly half a century ago and japanese prime 
minister toshiki kaifu extended honest apologies for korean 
suffering in the colonial period 
roh upon his arrival in seoul said it was time for the two 
countries to put the past behind them 
even if we may feel that the japanese apologies do not fully 
live up to our expectations we should accept them with magnanimity 
and generosity now that japan has forthrightly admitted its 
mistakes he said at an airport news conference 
during the colonial period japan tried to stifle korean culture 
by banning koreans from learning their language and forcing them to 
adoptjapanese names tens of thousands of koreans were killed after 
being drafted for the japanese war efforts 
i well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have 
about what went on between our country and japan in the past no 
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory roh said 
some koreans said japanese measures to clear up current sore 
points were more important than apologizing for the past 
there are unresolved disputes over discrimination against 
koreans living in japan aid to koreans who remain displaced after 
being forcibly removed from their homeland to perform wartime labor 
for japan and assistance to korean survivors of the atomic 
bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki 
roh said he had asked japan to move forward on these issues and 
expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far 
about 20000 police had been mobilized in tokyo to provide 
security for roh during his threeday state visit against possible 
threats from extreme leftist or rightist groups but no incidents 
were reported 
rohs visit to tokyo was only the second by a south korean head 
of state since the two countries established diplomatic relations 
in 1965 rohs predecessor chun doohwan visited japan in 1984 
japan and korea have a long history of enmity and sore points 
still linger from japans 191045 colonization of the korean 
peninsula 
the centerpiece of rohs visit was the thursday night state 
banquet at which akihito expressed his deepest regret for the 
suffering koreans endured at japanese hands kaifu offered his 
sincere remorse and honest apologies and said good relations 
between japan and korea are a basis for peace in the region 
roh extended the invitation to akihito and empress michiko to 
visit south korea during a short meeting with the emperor today at 
the akasaka state guesthouse said a palace official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
after your coronation i am sure that you will visit many 
countries and i hope that you will consider visiting south korea 
also the official quoted roh as saying 
akihito who assumed the throne after the death of his father 
emperor hirohito will not travel abroad until after his official 
coronation on nov 12 the coronation is traditionally delayed by a 
year of mourning for the deceased emperor 
akihito would be the first emperor to visit south korea since 
its creation after japans defeat in world war ii 
japanese foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said kaifu 
had also accepted an invitation from roh to visit south korea at a 
mutually convenient time

mikhail s gorbachev says he will keep hundreds of 
thousands of soviet troops in eastern germany and review his 
policies on european arms control and security negotiations if a 
united germany joins nato 
the soviet presidents comments friday came six days before he 
discusses german unification with president bush in washington it 
amounted to a new kremlin bargaining chip a message that the west 
would pay a high price for german membership in the western 
military alliance 
gorbachev repeated the soviet preference that germany belong to 
both the north atlantic treaty organization and the sovietled 
warsaw pact the bush administration favors only nato membership 
for a united germany 
gorbachev also suggested friday that a united germany could 
follow frances lead and take part only in nato political 
activities 
he told a news conference that western leaders seem to assume a 
unified germany would join nato but he said the german people 
should be allowed to decide the issue he said moscow was wary of 
that prospect 
what should we do then about all the negotiating processes 
including the european process the csce process the vienna 
disarmament process then we must take a fresh look at whether we 
should pursue the same policy whether we should base it on the 
same approaches gorbachev said 
the superpowers are trying to negotiate reductions in their 
nuclear and conventional forces and hope to reach agreements during 
the washington summit csce refers to the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe which deals with military 
security economic cooperation and human rights 
soviet negotiators and state department officials are still 
trying to wrap up major unsettled issues in a new strategic arms 
reduction treaty or start the aim is to expand on a declaration 
already ready for bush and gorbachev to sign during their may 
31june 3 summit 
us officials in washington said gorbachev made a similar 
warning to secretary of state james a baker iii during their talks 
last week in moscow 
a west german newspaper today quoted soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze as saying the soviets cannot approve nato 
membership for a united germany he told the paper the soviet 
position is determined by the realities of our foreign policy 
interests by our history and by our public opinion 
i believe that the west must understand this and that in this 
question we must be aware of our responsibility to our people he 
told welt am sonntag which released a text of the interview before 
its publication sunday 
gorbachev did not threaten to withdraw from the european 
negotiating processes and did not specify how the kremlins 
positions in those talks might change but referring to wartime 
treaties gorbachev indicated the estimated 380000 soviet troops 
in eastern germany would become squatters if the new country joins 
nato 
on the basis of those international legal acts the soviet 
union will remain where it is now with its group of troops he 
said

emergency force into the territories to protect the arab 
population no vote was taken on the issue and the security 
council meeting was to resume in new york on tuesday

that christian leader gen michel aoun and militia chieftain samir 
geagea have agreed to a permanant truce but their forces continued 
to fight 
police said aouns troops and geageas lebanese forces 
militiamen exchanged sniper fire in east beirut killing three 
people and wounding one 
the latest fighting raised the casualty toll to 1035 killed and 
2770 wounded since the power struggle between the rival warlords 
broke out jan 30 
there was no immediate comment from geagea or aoun on the 
declaration of the envoy pablo puente many previous ceasefires 
have failed to last 
puente said at a news conference that in addition to making 
permanant their 9dayold truce the two leaders had agreed to halt 
propaganda campaigns against each other and to release all 
prisoners 
also today the syrian army intervened to end 15 hours of street 
battles between rival shiite moslem militias that killed five 
people and wounded 42 
in another development israelibacked militiamen killed four 
arab guerrillas during a clash today in south lebanon the israeli 
army command and the guerrillas said the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine said its fighters attacked to avenge the 
slayings sunday of seven palestinian laborers by an israeli the 
slayings near tel aviv caused riots in the occupied lands 
syrian troops armed with automatic weapons and rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers moved into the south beirut slum quarters of 
hajjaj and haymadi before dawn to stop the fighting there 
the capitals moslem sectors remained tense with fighters of 
the fundamentalist proiranian hezbollah or party of god and the 
mainstream syrianbacked amal movement still on a combat footing 
the factions have been battling for dominance of lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest sect for 2 years by 
police count at least 1049 people have been killed and 3136 
wounded in that intermittent feud 
most of the 16 westerners missing in lebanon are believed held 
in the south beirut slums close to the fortified green line that 
slices the capital into christian and moslem sectors the hostages 
include six americans 
streets were littered with the burnedout blackened hulks of 
dozens of cars set ablaze by rocketpropelled grenades in the 
fighting 
hundreds of moslem families used the lull to evacuate the 
shantytown slums and head for the relative safety of villages in 
predominantly shiite south lebanon where hezbollah and amal 
frequently clash 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in the country mainly in moslem areas under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
in the clash in south lebanon lebanese security sources said 
the guerrillas ambushed a south lebanon army convoy near the town 
of shebaa in the eastern sector of the israelioccupied border zone

raids into northern galilee when it withdrew the bulk of its army 
from south lebanon in mid1985 three years after it invaded 
the israeli military also reported four guerrillas killed and 
said members of the south lebanon army which is trained and 
supplied by israel suffered no casualties an army spokesman said 
the attackers were members of george habashs popular front for the 
liberation of palestine 
the popular front in a series of communiques issued in beirut 
acknowledged four of its fighters had died and said the attack was 
to avenge the massacre of seven palestinian workers near tel aviv 
on sunday

regularly attack the israelis and their militia allies in south 
lebanon 
lebanese security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the guerrillas detonated three remotecontrol bombs on a road 
as the convoy passed 
it was the heaviest guerrilla raid in the heavily guarded buffer 
zone in several weeks

populist boris n yeltsin today failed to win a 
runoff election for the presidency of the soviet unions largest 
republic and the russian congress now must take new nominations 
yeltsin is considered one of mikhail s gorbachevs main rivals 
and his failure to win the runoff was a major victory for the 
soviet leader 
yeltsin won 503 votes 28 short of the necessary majority of the 
1060member congress his rival communist party functionary ivan 
polozkov received 497 votes 
lawmakers said yeltsin 59 may run again or that a compromise 
candidate with better chances of winning a majority may be 
nominated the legislators will resume their session on monday 
in fridays first round of voting by the russian congress 
yeltsin won 497 votes short of the 531 he needed for an absolute 
majority 
the candidate backed by gorbachev russian premier alexander 
vlasov withdrew from the race friday after it became clear he 
lacked yeltsins popularity 
during his campaign yeltsin angered gorbachev with calls for 
sovereignty for the russian republic which includes moscow the 
seat of national leadership russia by far the largest of the 
nations 15 republics contains more than twothirds of the 
countrys territory and half the soviet populace 
gorbachev accused yeltsin of being antisocialist and said his 
plans for russian autonomy would mean the breakup of the soviet 
union 
yeltsin pledged friday that if elected he would defend the 
republic from kremlin interference but also said he would be able 
to work with gorbachev 
yeltsin told the russian congress of his plans to promote 
russian sovereignty establish a market economy increase housing 
and fill stores with consumer goods 
he blasted the national government program announced thursday 
for a transition to a freemarket economy yeltsin said he backed 
an alternative program involving sale of government property full 
independence for enterprises more liberal laws on ownership and 
foreign loans 
yeltsin is already a member of the national congress of peoples 
deputies and a member of the communist party central committee 
yeltsin once a gorbachev protege has made a remarkable 
political comeback from disgrace two years ago when he was ousted 
from his post as moscow party chief and ostracized by the kremlin 
elite including gorbachev yeltsin has continued to criticize 
gorbachev for what he calls halfway reforms 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov appealed to consumers friday 
to stop their panic buying of food triggered by his announcement 
of plans for sharp price increases and urged lawmakers to quickly 
approve economic reforms 
opposition deputies in parliament demanded a noconfidence vote 
aimed at bringing down ryzhkovs government but he got one 
important voice of support for his program from gorbachev himself 
im hoping in the end after all the debates and they wont 
be simple well agree that we have to move toward a market im 
sure of this gorbachev told a news conference 
ryzhkovs plan broadcast on national television thursday 
proposes tripling the price of bread and other flourbased products 
on july and increasing the prices of most other consumer goods in 
january 
it envisions a fiveyear gradual shift to a governmentregulated 
market economy by freeing most prices raising taxes selling off 
state property and reducing central control of industry 
announcement of the plan triggered immediate rushes to stores 
for macaroni and bread ryzhkov told reporters at the kremlin 
now this wave for bread and bread products has already rolled 
through half the country and its gotten to moscow he said 
i am appealing for restraint and calm said ryzhkov looking 
haggard and with his voice ragged from fatigue 
at food shop number one on gorky street a shop assistant who 
asked not to be identified said panicstricken buyers are 
literally clearing full shelves for hoarding 
bread is the staple of the soviet diet virtually the only 
product thats always readily available and remains cheap at about 
32 cents a loaf

a moderate earthquake shook the 
portuguese capital for a few seconds saturday but caused no damage 
or injuries authorities said 
the quake which registered 40 on the richter scale was 
centered 90 miles west of lisbon in the atlantic ocean according 
to lisbons national institute for meteorology and geophysics 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 a quake registering 4 can cause moderate 
damage in a populated area 
much of lisbon was destroyed by a powerful earthquake and an 
ensuing tidal wave and fire in 1755 the city center was rebuilt

federal agents are investigating possible 
links between a carbomb blast that injured two radical 
environmentalists accused of carrying the explosives and a recent 
bombing at a lumber mill 
earth first activists darryl cherney and judi bari who have 
been waging a campaign to slow logging in northern californias 
oldgrowth forests strongly denied knowing anything about the pipe 
bomb that injured them thursday 
some of their supporters accused police of framing the victims 
and about 200 environment activists held a vigil at police 
headquarters friday night 
the two were put under arrest friday after police questioned 
cherney for several hours 
bari 40 was under police guard at a hospital where she was in 
stable condition after surgery for a fractured pelvis officials 
said cherney 33 was treated for minor injuries and booked into 
city jail 
oakland municipal court judge horace wheatley raised bail to 
100000 each based on what he called new information from oakland 
police he declined to elaborate 
no charges were immediately filed but police lt mike sims said 
at a news conference the evidence is strong they were 
transporting this device and thats why they were arrested 
we believe it went off accidentally sims said based on 
our determination of the placement of the device in the car we 
believe they should have known it was there 
sims declined to be specific about what evidence was found but 
the tribune of oakland quoted unidentified law enforcement sources 
today as saying that the bomb which was located behind the 
drivers seat was covered by baris guitar case 
she placed the case there when she got into the vehicle the 
sources said suggesting that she knew the device was in the car 
finishing nails identical to ones used in the bomb were found 
elsewhere in the car and similar nails were found during a search 
of one of the suspects home the sources said duct tape and wire 
resembling that used in the bomb was found in cherneys van and 
home and also in baris house they said 
duke diedrich spokesman for the fbi in san francisco said the 
bureau planned to send remnants of the pipe bomb to its 
headquarters for analysis and comparison to remains of a pipe bomb 
that exploded may 10 outside a lumber mill in cloverdale about 80 
miles north of san francisco that blast caused no injuries and 
only minor damage 
the fbi is also investigating possible links between fridays 
explosion and sabotage of pacific gas amp electric transmission lines 
in santa cruz county last month that left thousands of residents 
without power throughout the county 
we will conduct and have been conducting an investigation 
throughout northern california to see if any of the incidents are 
connected in any way diedrich said this is going to be a 
long involved investigation 
the bomb in baris car exploded on an oakland street as she and 
cherney were driving to a rally in santa cruz the blast blew out 
the windows and the left rear door bowed the roof upward and blew 
open other doors 
bari and cherney insisted they are victims not criminals 
we are demanding that the oakland police department and 
the fbi seek out this assassin and bring whoever it is to justice 
immediately cherney said in an interview from his jail cell 
susan jordan an attorney for bari said her client blamed the 
explosion on the timber industry were not involved in any 
violence jordan quoted bari as saying 
the pair were described by friends as dedicated pacifists 
instrumental in planning nonviolent efforts to halt what they 
believe is excessive logging of ancient redwood trees in northern 
california 
though earth first has become known for radical tactics 
including driving spikes into trees to damage logging equipment 
the group recently announced it was ending the practice 
sims said authorities had used three search warrants to find 
evidence that led to the arrests police thursday night searched 
cherneys van and a berkeley house occupied by several members of 
another environmentalist group seeds of peace on friday the 
searched baris home near ukiah 
cherney said he agreed to let police search the van because he 
feared for his life daniel barron an earth first organizer from 
san francisco said about a dozen antilogging activists have 
received anonymous death threats 
the arrests prompted earth first supporters to criticize police 
for blaming the victim they vowed to continue a 24hour vigil 
at oakland police headquarters until the activists are released 
i know they didnt blow themselves up said shannon marr a 
friend who was in a car ahead of baris vehicle

political action committees gave 635 million 
to congressional candidates in the first 15 months of the 1990 
election cycle targeting nearly 90 percent of the specialinterest 
money to incumbents 
the 4517 pacs registered with the federal election commission 
began april with another 131 million on hand for the final six 
months of the election year the fec said in a study released 
saturday 
the 635 million in candidate contributions by pacs from 
january 1989 through march 1990 represented a 13 percent increase 
over the comparable period in the 198788 election cycle 
most of the increase came in spending on house races and was 
partly attributable to the 10 special house elections held to fill 
vacancies over the past year 
all told pacs raised 219 million and spent 173 million in the 
15 months covered by the study fund raising was up 2 percent over 
the last cycle and spending increased 7 percent 
total spending was nearly three times the amount actually 
donated to congressional candidates total spending includes 
administrative staff and new fundraising costs and in some cases 
transfers from the national pacs to affiliated state pacs for use 
in state elections 
the studys release comes as the senate considers 
campaignfinance legislation containing new limits on pac activity 
designed to erode some of the fundraising edge typically enjoyed 
by incumbents 
the fec data show pacs not only are spending more on 
congressional races but incumbents are getting even larger shares 
of the money 
in the 15 months studied incumbents got 564 million from 
pacs or 89 percent of pac candidate donations challengers 
received 32 million or just 5 percent the rest went to 
candidates in races without incumbents 
in the same 15month period of the 198788 cycle incumbents got 
88 percent of pac donations to candidates and challengers received 
65 percent two years earlier the edge was 85 percent to 7 
percent in favor of incumbents 
what this shows is that we need public financing of 
elections said joan claybrook the head of the publicinterest 
lobby public citizen pac contributions from special interests 
which want legislation enacted should not determine who gets 
elected to congress 
democrats largely because of their majorities in both chambers 
of congress received more pac money 
this years democratic senate candidates received 103 million 
from pacs through the end of march with 95 million of that total 
going to incumbent senators facing reelection gop senate 
candidates got 95 million from pacs over the same period of 
which 7 million went to incumbents 
in house races pacs gave 301 million to democratic 
candidates 28 million of it to incumbents republican candidates 
received 133 million with all but 240000 going to incumbents 
the pacs also reported contributing 103 million to national 
state and local political party organizations 
twentynine pacs reported raising at least 1 million over the 
15 months and nine of them raised at least 2 million 
twentythree pacs spent more than 1 million in the study period 
three topped 2 million 
topping the fundraising list was the teamsters union pac which 
reported raising 67 million in the 15month period the teamsters 
pac also was first in spending at 46 million and in the 49 
million it had on hand as of march 31 
another labor pac that of the letter carriers union narrowly 
eclipsed the teamsters in donations to candidates with 
contributions totaling 884600 in the study period 2000 more 
than the teamsters group 
american telephone amp telegraphs pac was the leading corporate 
pac with 18 million in receipts disbursements 17 million 
and contributions to candidates 829000 
leading the trade and healthorganization pacs in fund raising 
and overall spending was the american medical association pac 
which collected 41 million in the 15month period and spent 21 
million 
but in that same category the realtors pac gave the most to 
candidates reporting 789000 in contributions compared with the 
ama pacs 542037 
the realtors group was second to the ama in fund raising in this 
category collecting 32 million in the 15month period

the threeway fight for iowas 
democratic gubernatorial nomination began as a battle over abortion 
but has ranged far afield in a freeforall that has iowans 
wondering what comes next 
the heat got so intense at one point that state party chairman 
john roehrick told two contenders to cool it and keep their 
eyes on the prize twoterm republican gov terry branstad 
with the june 5 primary just around the corner the democratic 
race remains too close to call 
the fight is between state house speaker don avenson state 
attorney general tom miller and former banker john chrystal all 
hoping to oppose branstad in november 
some argue the pressure is higher because the state features the 
firstinthenation precinct caucuses that brings more attention 
to the state even in nonpresidential years avenson said 
the significance of iowa goes beyond our small population 
he said were the firstinthenation caucus state were the 
state that many people in this country listen to for direction in 
terms of democratic politics 
because of that activists on the abortion issue have gotten 
involved kate michelman head of the national abortion rights 
action league said the group would target miller and branstad 
both of whom are prolife for defeat 
michelman previewed television ads the group had prepared and 
said she planned a 250000 campaign that was derailed however 
when only one television station in the state would carry the 
commercials 
narals iowa affiliate endorsed avenson angering chrystal who 
pointed to his 25 years of financial support for planned parenthood 
and abortion rights but avenson also snared endorsements from 
other feminist groups including the national organization for 
women 
the groups believe avenson has the best chance of beating 
miller and they dont want to split the prochoice vote 
iowa democrats wont let these wouldbe kingmakers tell them 
how to vote snapped chrystal 
you have to wonder why don avenson would accept support from a 
group that is narrow negative and not interested in the future of 
iowa miller echoed 
the campaign has featured twists on other issues as well 
avenson is a large man who concedes hes as much as 40 pounds 
overweight in 1985 he suffered a heart attack and he was 
hospitalized for two days last week for emergency procedures to 
clear a blocked artery in his heart 
some activists believe voters will be nervous about avensons 
health but others look for a sympathy vote 
avenson said his quick recovery demonstrates his general good 
health 
it makes miller and chrystal understand theyre dealing with 
steel wrap and rawhide here not just a normal person said 
avenson who took time out to admonish reporters on their smoking 
habits and weight 
for his part miller has sought to deflect attention from 
abortion by stressing tough anticrime stands television ads brag 
hes convicted 135 murderers and underscore his proposal to 
halve the bloodalcohol level needed for a drunken driving 
conviction 
avenson charges that would make criminals out of people who 
drink two cans of beer and says its insane miller accused 
avenson of being on the side of the drunk driver 
thats when roehrick told the candidates to keep their eyes on 
branstad 
many label chrystal a dark horse but hes well connected and 
has raised far more money than the other democrats he has reported 
raising 524000 to millers 339000 and avensons 294000 
branstad dwarfs them all with 24 million 
chrystal also will get attention in the closing days of the 
campaign courtesy of the summit between president bush and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev

the tormented inner life of norwegian artist 
edvard munch who once said that my pictures are my diaries is 
laid bare in a new exhibition of his prints opening sunday at the 
national gallery of art 
the shows 94 prints were assembled from the holdings of sarah 
and lionel epstein of washington dc who plan eventually to give 
their entire collection of about 200 munch woodcuts lithographs 
and other graphic works to the national gallery 
gallery officials say the epsteins who began collecting his 
prints in 1961 have the largest and finest collection of munchs 
graphic works outside europe 
to mark the shows opening the epsteins gave the gallery two of 
the prints on display they are the kiss a color woodcut made 
in 1902 and madonna a color woodcut combined with lithograph 
made in the same year which presents an ambiguous image of 
religious or sexual ecstasy 
the prints reveal the turbulent feelings of anger jealousy 
loneliness anxiety fear and sexual desire that haunted munch for 
much of his life his recurring artistic themes such as sick 
children and estranged couples reflected his own romantic 
conflicts and the traumatic deaths of his parents and siblings 
senior curator andrew robison said munch like his contemporary 
sigmund freud portrays the life of his inner self his emotions 
and dreams 
munchs approach to life through his art and innovative print 
techniques was highly influential among german expressionists 
gallery director j carter brown called munch who died in 1944 
one of the great talents of modern western civilization 
the exhibition titled edvard munch master prints from the 
epstein family collection will appear at the national gallery 
through sept 3

on a siding near an interstate highway 
the old cabooses sit out of service but theyre far from the end 
of their line 
already many of these railroad relics have been cleaned 
painted and moved across the country to serve as quilt shops ice 
cream parlors storage buildings and motel rooms 
the railroads dont make them anymore says don flynn a 
danville businessman who has just five of his original 26caboose 
fleet left at the siding visible from interstate 74 
flynn who operates prairie states warehouse has the cabooses 
lined up outside his business with a telephone number and for 
sale sign displayed for passing motorists 
the collection caught the eye of james friedlander of freeport 
maine 
last year in the dead of winter we were driving by prairie 
states and saw four or five cabooses parked on the tracks along the 
interstate friedlander said they gave us the keys and said to 
pick the one we wanted 
friedlander selected his favorite paid flynn 3500 for it and 
shipped it to freeport for an additional 2000 a crane lifted the 
caboose from the track and took it to friedlanders 15room 
bedandbreakfast home 
he and his wife planned to use the caboose for another sleeping 
room 
instead we use it for an office and for storage said 
friedlander 
flynn acquired the 26 cabooses in 1982 after the death of the 
danville businessman who owned them 
we had the tracks out here and so we just brought the cabooses 
he owned out here and tried to sell them said flynn 
the first 14 went for 2500 each the price has risen to 4500 
each caboose is 40 feet long 13 feet wide and 16 feet high and 
weighs 30 tons they have toilets and heating stoves that were used 
by the railroad crewmen who once rode in them 
railroads have been phasing out cabooses which once were the 
last cars on freight trains 
flynn said that when the last five cabooses are gone he probably 
will have no more to sell theyre getting harder and harder to 
come by he said

leftist rebels in el salvador have flagrantly 
violated international law by executing hundreds of civilians over 
the years without proper judicial procedures a human rights group 
said saturday 
americas watch a privately funded group based in new york said 
in a report the fmln rebels should immediately halt trials of 
suspected war criminals until the insurgents can prove the 
proceedings comply with international standards 
it also called on the insurgents to renounce the use of the 
death penalty to punish offenses related to the civil war 
the report said the rebels are bound by the terms of geneva 
convention rules which provide for the protection of victims of 
civil conflicts 
specifically the study accused the insurgents in some instances 
of carrying out assassinationstyle executions of government 
officials members of civil defense groups and others said to be 
government informers or collaborators 
they cited el salvadors attorney general roberto garcia 
alvarado as being the victim of an extrajudicial slaying a 
year ago 
in other instances the report said the victims were given the 
death penalty after being subjected to a flawed judicial 
proceedings in areas controlled by the rebels 
the salvadoran military has been widely accused of promoting or 
engaging in extrajudicial slayings over the years and americas 
watch has highlighted these abuses in previous reports 
but the report released saturday titled violations of fair 
trial guarantees by the fmlns ad hoc courts focuses on rebel 
excesses 
in response fmln spokesmen said death sentences for enemy 
collaborators normally are preceded by an investigation whose 
results are judged by an impartial civilian tribunal 
the rebel spokesmen cited by americas watch acknowledged that 
conditions for a fair trial are not always ideal in 
rebelcontrolled territory in some zones the spokesmen have 
noted there is not a single person who qualifies as a defense 
attorney 
but americas watch rejected the fmln arguments asserting that 
the rebels have given the authority to impose the death penalty to 
persons with no legal training it called this practice 
appallingly indecent 
the report also denounced as a serious flaw the fmln 
decision to withhold the identities of the members of its courts 
the insurgents have said confidentiality is necessary to protect 
these persons from reprisals 
as for the rebel practice of selecting the counsel for the 
accused the report said this makes a farce of any defense the 
rebels assert is provided to the accused 
the fmln has in public statements said it is attempting to 
ensure compliance with the geneva convention in its judicial 
proceedings 
rebel spokesmen also have acknowledged that the fmln is 
normally severe with those who are discovered to be engaging in 
spy activities for the government 
it finds itself forced to be so because the government forces 
with the support of american advisors have increased their efforts 
to create intelligence networks which are aimed at discovering 
where the strategic command posts of the fmln are in order to 
annihilate them the fmln has said 
the conflict between the rebels and the usbacked salvadoran 
government is believed to have claimed more than 70000 lives since 
it began more than 10 years ago

investigators picked up the pieces of an air 
force jet and tried to determine why the plane crashed plowing a 
fiery path through a residential neighborhood the pilot and a 
woman on the ground were killed 
the f16a on an approved training route had just flown low 
over a public school with more than 1000 students when it went 
down friday morning in rural south georgia witnesses said 
it was the second time since november that a military jet 
crashed in georgia and killed civilians on the ground 
my first thought was theyre bombing us said vance taft 
whose farm abuts the crash site two miles north of pearson 
taft and his wife lucy watched in horror as the plane 
destroyed two houses and continued across a highway shearing a 
pine tree in half turning sideways and shattering to pieces 
killed in the crash were the pilot and a woman identified by the 
atkinson county sheriffs department as marian lanier in her 
mid50s who worked each friday as a housekeeper in one of the 
leveled homes 
air force officials today identified the pilot as maj archie e 
stuart 39 of new castle pa an 18year air force veteran stuart 
was chief of operations plans for the 347th tactical fighter wing 
he was assigned to moody in october 1988 
the f16a fighting falcon was on a training flight from 
moody air force base about 40 miles away near valdosta to lake 
george weapons range in florida when it crashed moody officials 
said the pilot was the only person on board they said 
a 50member team from moody searched the woods near the damaged 
houses putting remains of the plane into black plastic bags an 
air force board was formed to investigate the crash 
the boards interim president col stu mosbey estimated it 
would take 30 days to determine the cause of the crash 
the plane which general dynamics corp said cost about 9 
million was carrying 20mm practice bullets including some that 
apparently caught fire after the crash six practice bombs and a 
practice unarmed sidewinder missile mosbey said he said all the 
items were recovered within the crash area 
the jet was in a twoship formation with another f16a when 
it went down said air force master sgt pat miller 
mosbey said jets from the base routinely make lowlevel training 
flights at altitudes of no more than 500 feet 
the training route used by the two pilots friday is approved by 
the federal aviation administration a moody spokesman said 
the jets had just passed over a public school when the one went 
down 
we see the planes flying low over the school all of the time 
but these two were flying lower than usual said michele 
mckinnon a teacher at the countys elementary and high school 
complex where more than 1000 students were startled by the 
explosion 
we ran around to the front of the school and we could see the 
smoke coming from where the plane crashed she said 
the plane itself did not burn but flames from a fuel tank that 
tore away from the jet and exploded quickly engulfed the 
singlestory house where mrs lanier was working city fire chief 
henry vickers said 
the house and a mobile home behind it were destroyed and at 
least seven other homes were damaged by debris authorities said 
in november a navy jet crashed into an apartment complex north 
of atlanta and burst into flames killing two residents of the 
complex and seriously wounding the pilot the fighter was trying to 
land at dobbins air force base when it crashed in suburban smyrna

michael creamer could produce a show 
called americas most inebriated videos but the veteran 
policeman is just glad to show the videotapes in court to convict 
drunken drivers 
during nearly three decades as an officer creamer has arrested 
scores of drivers who couldnt walk a straight line or recite the 
alphabet only to see them acquitted once they got to court looking 
sober and respectable 
but thanks to one of the nations insurance giants he and other 
law enforcement agents across the nation have been turning on video 
cameras to capture on tape the evidence of drunken driving 
swerving cars slurred speech wobbly steps 
with the video cameras you have a pretty clear case said 
creamer chief deputy in the franklin county sheriffs department 
in columbus ohio the tape says it all 
hartfordbased aetna life amp casualty has donated more than 300 
video cameras to 19 police departments in 10 states under a program 
it began last year with mothers against drunk driving 
so far results have been impressive 
creamers department has a perfect conviction rate all 27 
drivers whose videotaped arrests have made it to court have pleaded 
guilty 
in tampa fla where police have used cameras for almost a 
year 36 out of 37 cases that went to court have resulted in a 
conviction most through guilty pleas entered after defendants and 
defense attorneys watched the tapes 
its just indisputable evidence said jimmy stallings a 
deputy chief in the tampa police department once the defense 
attorney sees what their client looks like at that particular point 
in time its very obvious its not even close 
many times youve got a person who says they had two drinks 
and theyre falling down drunk on the videotape 
aetna concedes that its move is just good business as well as 
being philanthropic 
the company estimates it paid 250 million in claims from 
drunken driving accidents last year the 300000 worth of video 
equipment is a small price to pay to combat what has become a 
national epidemic aetna says 
the drunken driving problem is a major business problem in 
addition to taking a terrible human toll said aetna spokesman 
robert caruthers thats where these cameras fit in we believe 
it has a very strong deterrent effect 
the houston police department got the first camera in july 1989 
since then aetna has donated cameras to police departments in 
phoenix pittsburgh richmond va indianapolis montgomery ala 
orlando and fort lauderdale fla and kansas city mo the 
colorado highway patrol has also received cameras 
hoping to capitalize on the publicity from antidrunken driving 
campaigns timed for the memorial day holiday aetna this month 
donated another batch of cameras to seven more departments austin 
el paso and dallasfort worth texas buffalo and rochester ny 
cleveland and cincinnati 
aetna plans to donate cameras to departments in connecticut this 
summer 
officers turn on the dashboardmounted cameras as soon as they 
spot somebody they suspect is driving drunk 
the videotapes typically show a car weaving across the road a 
driver stumbling through his alphabet or wobbling as he tries to 
walk a straight line and an officer telling the suspect he is 
under arrest for drunken driving 
most police departments say they tell drivers they are being 
videotaped just before the arrest but officials also acknowledge 
that have not made it mandatory for officers to warn suspects about 
the cameras 
videotaping suspects before they are read their rights and 
without a lawyer present has raised some questions about legality 
and constitutionality 
loren siegel an attorney for the american civil liberties 
union said the aclu is monitoring the program but has not decided 
whether to challenge it 
although actual testimony isnt being given videotaping 
without the presence of an attorney raises the selfincrimination 
question and thats a basic part of due process of the law 
siegel said one should not be forced to give testimony verbal 
or otherwise against oneself 
drunken driving arrests in the united states reached an alltime 
high in 1983 at about 192 million then dropped to about 18 
million a year since then according to the national highway 
traffic safety administration

folks in this parched seaside 
resort perhaps the driest town in california this summer cope 
with drought in their own ways 
some blame the government some seek charity and some pour 
money on their problems 
at this point people are really in a frenzy and theres a 
lot of noise about what we should be doing said tom rogers 
chairman of the santa barbara county board of supervisors the 
water shortage has occupied all the politics in the area for 
the past three or four months 
unlike the rest of southern california which brings in outside 
water in canals and aqueducts the county and scenic city 100 miles 
northwest of los angeles rely entirely on groundwater and local 
rainfall that has to serve the countys 300000 residents plus 5 
million tourists a year 
years of belownormal precipitation have exhausted one reservoir 
and nearly drained another the region now faces a 45 percent 
supply shortfall forcing the city council to declare a drought 
emergency in february 
the council has imposed some drastic measures to foster 
conservation water rates were hiked drastically outdoor 
sprinklers and hosing were banned other rationing measures were 
ordered and three drought cops were hired to enforce the rules 
one customer with a leaky toilet recently complained he was 
charged 2725 city officials said 
gardening businesses have dried up farmworkers also have lost 
work said josie mendoza a case worker at catholic charities 
families are unable to pay their water bills and evictions have 
increased along with requests for assistance and shelter 
but the drought has created opportunities for some entrepreneurs 
steve bates 24 delivers water in a 4000gallon tanker truck 
to spray homeowners trees yards and shrubs for 80 a load and 
55 an hour 
the best way to describe that truck these days is its like an 
icecream truck said bates who gets his water from a private 
well people are always stopping me while im driving down the 
street 
landscaper walter barrows offers to make a dying lawn look lush 
by painting it green a modest front yard costs just 45 he 
says spraypainted turf doesnt look bad from a distance but 
underfoot it feels like iowa corn stalks following harvest 
in nearby affluent enclaves drilling rig operators are busy 
with orders from residents willing to pay upwards of 20000 for 
private wells 
county environmental health officials say at least 81 well 
permits have been issued this year in affluent montecito compared 
with 12 for the same period last year since 1975 3295 private 
wells have been drilled throughout the county according to health 
officials who monitor well water quality 
the drilling has prompted worries that an everymanforhimself 
attitude could deplete groundwater 
those people who have money can do any dang thing they want 
said er masonheimer 76 a retired construction worker who 
recalled that just 10000 people lived in the area when he arrived 
in 1917 
residents are still buzzing about harold simmons the 
dallasbased corporate raider who paid the nearby montecito water 
district 25504 in surcharges for almost 10 million gallons of 
water last year at his 23acre vacation home 
simmons apparently was willing to pay any price said henry 
muller a montecito director after weeks of wrangling last fall 
simmons drilled his own well for 18000 
for almost 20 years santa barbara city and county officials 
have used water as a means of controlling growth 
if you want to build a house today you usually have to drill a 
well because the towns of santa barbara montecito and goleta 
refuse to issue permits for new water hookups muller said the 
city of santa barbara has clamped down on new construction 
altogether because of the drought 
local water agencies cannot regulate drilling outside the city 
because water is a property right under california law 
city officials have been considering a number of longrange 
solutions to modestly supplement existing water supplies on 
tuesday the city council is expected to approve initial 
development of a multimilliondollar seawater desalinization plant 
other options include shipping water by tanker from the 
northwest arranging water transfers from the state and drilling 
more wells 
in the meantime people like 82yearold herman fisher will 
continue to use rags to wipe dirt off cars returned to fiesta car 
rental 
they dont have enough water for all the people he said 
of course you cant blame people for moving here its the 
nicest place in the world

the 3 million highport marina on lake 
texoma has a restaurant and even an outdoor dance floor but these 
days its more of a scuba divers haven 
nearly a month after severe flooding began the marina and other 
lakeshore properties are still under as much as 10 to 12 feet of 
water 
record rain in the first days of may following the wettest 
spring since 1922 made the manmade lake on the red river rise to 
28 feet above normal flooding hundreds of properties water flowed 
over the dams spillway for only the second time since it was built 
in 1944 
residents of lake texomas 1200 miles of shoreline in texas and 
oklahoma are among thousands whose lives will be disrupted for 
months by flooding 
on memorial day boaters approaching the sprawling highport 
marina can refuel at a floating gas station and buy food under a 
tent pitched on a hill overlooking the submerged pompanos and 
puffers restaurants 
many months from now the lake businesses and residents along 
with more than 8 million visitors who come to texoma every year 
will still be feeling the floodings impact said highport owner 
cd loe jr the whole area will have an economic problem through 
next year including decreased sales tax revenue 
only the rooftops of loes two restaurants and a bar can be seen 
at the lake about six miles north of pottsboro texoma is slowly 
receding but at 6 inches a day it will take two months just for 
water to drain from his development 
flooding on the red and other rivers also prompted disaster 
declarations for more than onethird of arkansas 75 counties and 
caused millions of dollars damage to farmland and homes farther 
downstream on the red more than 100000 acres have been flooded in 
louisiana more than 1000 oklahomans were affected by flooding and 
tornadoes said the red cross 
not far south of lake texoma the same storms made the trinity 
river flood in the dallas area downstream in southeastern texas 
that river will continue to flood lowlying subdivisions until fall 
as runoff is slowly released from swollen reservoirs said david 
haun of the texas division of emergency management in austin 
the upper trinity river has a normal flow of 7000 cubic feet 
per second said trinity river authority spokesman john jadrosich 
in arlington but for the next few weeks it will course at nearly 
three times that rate 20000 cfs 
thats the point at which the river begins to leave its banks 
and cause lowlevel flooding so that will continue through the end 
of the summer he said 
texas croplands many acres of which remain underwater suffered 
hundreds of millions of dollars in damage said heather ball a 
texas department of agriculture economist in austin 
downstream at the trinity rivers lake livingston dam the 
release of water through the spillway has exceeded 100000 cfs 
five times normal 
below lake livingston several hundred homes were flooded and 
jim mitchum liberty county emergency management coordinator said 
the high water could affect as many as 7000 residents 
of 24 us army corps of engineers reservoirs on the red 
trinity and five other river basins 20 are still storing excess 
water said corps spokesman ron ruffennach it will take more than 
two months to drain the excess from some of them he said 
although the corps says the system of dams and levees built 
since the 1940s spared texas from suffering more than the 500 
million worth of losses already estimated critics said more and 
better flood control is needed 
in arkansas gov bill clinton appointed a task force to examine 
the corps release of water from reservoirs along the red and 
arkansas rivers 
and the lake texoma association is urging the government to 
build more dams upstream on the red and washita rivers 
it is obvious that lake texoma cannot hold all the water that 
the watershed can supply said loe where are the politicals 
and why are they not doing something about the problem if texoma 
cant hold the water why dont we have another lake

the soviet union soon will undertake a 
radical review of its foreign military assistance programs a 
soviet communist party official said saturday 
andrei s grachev deputy of the international department of the 
communist party central committee told reporters that moscow is 
putting less emphasis on its relations with the third world in 
light of political changes in eastern europe and at home 
he indicated that foreign military assistance programs could be 
readjusted as a result 
these will be subject to a very radical review in the near 
future he said 
grachev acted as moderator at the first in a series of meetings 
between us journalists and soviet political figures scholars 
writers and others who are in washington in connection with the 
ussoviet summit meeting that begins thursday 
his comments about foreign military assistance were in response 
to a question about whether moscow intended to reduce its aid to 
cuba and other third world countries in light of its own domestic 
economic and political problems 
grachev did not specifically mention cuba but his response 
seemed to indicate that a review of foreign military assistance 
would include all countries currently receiving such aid 
a us defense intelligence agency official told congress last 
month that the soviets already have been cutting back their 
military aid programs the value of soviet military assistance to 
third world countries dropped to 17 billion in 1989 about 2 
billion below the previous years figure 
lower shipments to iraq and other middle east states accounted 
for the drop the dia official said 
grachev also said that while some parts of the soviet union are 
suffering acute food shortages moscow is not looking for emergency 
assistance from the united states he said the main thing the 
united states can do for the soviet economy is help end the arms 
race thereby reducing the burden of soviet military investment 
in describing the context of the coming summit meeting between 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush grachev 
said the key factor was that this would be the first superpower 
summit since the demise of the cold war the two men last met in 
december 1989 a month after the fall of the berlin wall 
grachev said the tenor of the emerging new world order will 
depend on the results of the meetings here which are expected to 
focus on arms control economic relations and the future political 
and military structure of europe

the magellan spacecraft completed a 
fourday runthrough of the tasks it will perform when it enters 
venus orbit to map that planet later this year scientists said 
the spacecraft 104 million miles from earth and 12 million 
miles from venus completed 100 hours of maneuvers data gathering 
and communication with ground stations on earth on friday 
afternoon said magellan project manager anthony j spear 
the spacecraft performed flawlessly spear said 
magellan is scheduled to go into orbit around venus on aug 10 
to begin a 243day mission mapping about 90 percent of earths 
sister planet 
the spacecraft will look for ancient stream channels shorelines 
and other evidence the planet once had oceans 
scientists believe an unchecked greenhouse effect in which the 
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped solar heat raised the planets 
temperature until water disappeared 
gravity forces on venus will be studied by plotting the path of 
magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the planets surface 
then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4977 miles 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989

the nations bill for cleaning up the savings 
and loan crisis is rising along with the temperatures of 
legislators who accuse the justice department of dragging its feet 
on prosecuting sampl fraud 
as the rhetoric heats up some department officials are hinting 
that major indictments could come down soon 
we do have some excellent investigations that we hope will be 
very productive in the very near future marvin collins the us 
attorney in fort worth texas said last thursday 
collins declined to elaborate since the justice departments 
policy is not to discuss pending cases but there is speculation 
that indictments could be announced in the coming weeks against sampl 
highfliers in texas a hotbed of thrift fraud and failure 
the bush administration meanwhile has sharply boosted its 
estimates of how much the government will have to borrow to clean 
up the savings and loan mess treasury secretary nicholas brady 
told congress this past week the borrowing need is between 90 
billion and 130 billion 
the new assessment came after the administration insisted for 
more than a year that most of the problem could be resolved with 
the 50 billion in borrowing authority included in the sampl bailout 
bill 
us taxpayers will have to shell out an astounding 325 billion 
or so to cover losses to depositors of the federally insured 
thrifts 
some democratic legislators perhaps sensing a potential 
campaign issue are becoming more muscular in their approach to the 
sampl debacle 
and some government agencies such as the office of thrift 
supervision seem to be taking a higher profile as well timothy 
ryan who became the ots director in early april held his first 
news conference last wednesday he outlined a broad game plan of 
enforcement under which the ots and other federal agencies plan 
to coordinate efforts with the justice department to bring 
perpetrators of sampl fraud to justice 
at the white house president bush said the worsening thrift 
crisis causes me great concern and the first priority of 
government policy makers is to protect the depositors 
the house banking committee held a hearing tuesday and wednesday 
on the 1 billion collapse of silverado banking savings and loan 
association a denver thrift that counted bushs son neil among 
its directors 
committee chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said he will 
ask attorney general dick thornburgh to testify before the panel as 
it broadens its sampl investigation 
another democrat on the committee rep frank annunzio of 
illinois was more strident 
we must find out why the justice department is so reluctant to 
investigate savings and loan cases annunzio told the hearing 
wednesday the taxpayers have a halftrillion reasons to want an 
answer to the question when are the savings and loan crooks going 
to jail 
in fact some of them already have been put behind bars since 
congress passed the sampl bailout bill nine months ago twentythree 
former thrift officers and roughly the same number of real estate 
developers brokers and accountants are serving terms ranging from 
six months to 30 years for bank fraud conspiracy and related 
charges according to the justice department 
but justice still has a backlog of thousands of potential 
criminal cases under investigation ranging from simple teller 
thefts to serious abuses that dragged down thrifts 
the cases themselves are very difficult to make justice 
department spokesman doug tillett said thursday its very 
difficult to prove criminal intent 
nearly all of the convictions so far have been in southwest 
texas the department has set up sampl fraud task forces in 27 cities 
across the country 
tillett said government investigators have to trace very 
complex usually bogus financial transactions with the result 
that it takes three to four years on average to build a fraud case 
tillett declined to comment on whether the department planned to 
announce big indictments soon he did promise however that 
youre going to see prosecutions 
concern about the pace of investigations and prosecutions isnt 
limited to the democrats on the banking committee 
its not a partisan thing at all said a committee staffer 
on the republican side who asked not to be identified by name 
were more than prepared to help to get the attorney general up 
here 
he was more inclined than the democrats however to give the 
justice department the benefit of the doubt on the footdragging 
issue i would assume that theyre doing the best they can he 
said

president roh taewoo said saturday 
that japans apologies for its brutal colonial rule might not 
satisfy all south koreans but he urged them to look to the future 
not the past 
roh returned from an emotional threeday visit to japan aimed at 
beginning a new partnership between the asian neighbors at its 
conclusion he invited emperor akihito to make the first japanese 
imperial visit to south korea 
during rohs visit akihito expressed deepest regret for the 
sufferings and pain japan inflicted on korea during its colonial 
rule from 1910 to 1945 japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
extended his sincere remorse and honest apologies 
kaifus apology was japans clearest statement of regret ever 
over its military past but roh acknowledged many south koreans 
would be dissatisfied with it 
i well understand what feelings my fellow countrymen have 
about what went on between our country and japan in the past no 
amount of apology can be fully satisfactory roh said at a news 
conference at seouls airport 
during much of the colonial period koreans were forced to speak 
japanese use japanese names and worship the late japanese emperor 
hirohito akihitos father many koreans died after being 
conscripted into japans army or in dangerous jobs as laborers in 
japan 
before leaving tokyo on saturday roh said akihitos words of 
regret were very significant and said the emperor and kaifu 
had expressed a common awareness about this unfortunate period 
between our two countries 
with this i feel that myself and the people of my country 
feel we can put the unfortunate period of our history behind us 
roh said 
in tokyo about 20000 police had been mobilized to guard 
against threats to roh from both rightist and leftist groups but 
no incidents were reported 
during a brief visit to osaka in western japan on his way home 
about 30 leftists demonstrated peacefully against rohs visit 
police said 
rohs visit had sparked far bigger protests in south korea 
before he left for japan radicals and human rights groups 
demonstrated almost daily demanding that he cancel his visit 
one man slashed his belly with a knife in front of the japanese 
embassy in seoul in protest 
roh said after his return that he believed kaifus and akihitos 
statements of regret were sufficient and urged that they be 
accepted 
even if we may feel that the japanese apologies do not fully 
live up to our expectations we should accept them with magnanimity 
and generosity now that japan has forthrightly admitted its 
mistakes reflected on them and apologized he said 
with that i believe we must now forge a new era of 
neighborliness and friendship he added 
some sore points remain unresolved including discrimination 
against korean residents in japan and health care for korean 
survivors of the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki 
roh made clear that he had asked japan to move forward on those 
issues but he said he was satisfied with the progress so far 
if we are to promote the peace and prosperity of northeast 
asia and also usher in an asianpacific age by the 21st century we 
should advance friendly cooperation with japan our nextdoor 
neighbor he said

west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher called saturday for a new treatybased economic 
partnership between the united states and europe to ensure that the 
reduction in political and military tensions is not replaced by 
wars of trade and technology 
the atlantic must not grow wider as a result of european 
unification genscher declared 
in a commencement address at the georgetown university school of 
foreign service genscher also called for the soviet union to 
become a full partner through the 35nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe in developing a stable european 
confederation from the atlantic to the urals 
genscher made no mention of soviet president michael s 
gorbachevs warning on friday that the soviet union would keep its 
troops in eastern germany and would review its participation in the 
csce process if a reunited germany is a military rather than just 
political member of the north atlantic treaty organization 
but genscher who met with his soviet counterpart eduard a 
shevardnadze in geneva on thursday did affirm his governments 
determination that a united germany will remain a decisive 
advocate of the close bonds between europe and america and will 
remain a member of nato 
genschers commencement address duplicated in large measure a 
speech he made to the american society of newspaper editors in 
washington several weeks earlier when he called upon the united 
states and canada to join members of the european community in a 
joint declaration heralding a new atlantic partnership a 
declaration encompassing all the political economic technological 
and cultural aspects of our relationship 
on saturday he said such a declaration must be followed by a 
europeanamerican treaty aimed at shaping the future he did not 
elaborate as to what that might specifically entail but said the 
right decision to reduce political and military tension must not be 
replaced by a wrong decision to engage in wars of trade and 
technology 
national thinking is no longer in line with the new challenges 
confronting the whole of mankind genscher said the future 
belongs to a worldwide domestic policy which must involve a new 
culture entailing the coexistence of the nations 
by 1992 trade among the 12 member nations of the ec will be 
simplified by the lifting of hundreds of tariffs and other trade 
restrictions many american business and political leaders fear 
this singlemarket system will unfairly restrict us and 
noneuropean trade 
genscher said he was confident that the summit between 
presidents bush and gorbachev in the week ahead will lead to a 
new broadbased breakthrough on nuclear arms control and than an 
agreement on conventional troop cuts will be reached by the end of 
the year 
the conventional pact he said will pave the way for further 
farreaching reductions in troops and for the reorganization of all 
troops in europe 
the global challenge now said genscher is to ensure the 
survival of mankind the vicious circle of poverty overpopulation 
and the destruction of the environment has reached new proportions 
life on our planet is being threatened now that europe is 
achieving peace now that east and west are bringing their 
senseless waste of resources on the arms race to an end mankinds 
war with nature must also end

radical reformer boris n yeltsin failed saturday 
to win a majority in balloting for president of russia the largest 
soviet republic but said hell start a new campaign monday for 
another election 
the congress of the russian federation will take new nominations 
then and yeltsin said he will stick to his platform of 
transferring economic and political decisionmaking power from 
central authorities to the republic despite opposition from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
i am not going to change on matters of principle he said as 
he strode through the kremlin grounds after saturdays runoff 
election in the parliament 
gorbachev who holds the posts of soviet president and general 
secretary of the soviet communist party accused yeltsin on 
wednesday of being antisocialist and said his demands for russian 
sovereignty would mean the breakup of the soviet union 
if yeltsin ultimately wins russias presidential election the 
post would give him and his supporters a prominent platform from 
which to continue their campaign to accelerate gorbachevs 
political and economic reforms 
yeltsin pledged friday to defend the republic from kremlin 
interference but also said he could bury personal differences and 
work with gorbachev 
in fridays first round of balloting he won 497 votes forcing a 
runoff on saturday but yeltsin received 503 votes in the second 
round still short of the 531 needed to win 
his opponent krasnodar communist party chief ivan polozkov won 
473 votes in the first round and 458 in the second 
the russian congress is electing the first president of the 
republic by far the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
russia comprises more than twothirds of the countrys territory 
and is home to half the soviet populace 
yeltsin told reporters he thought he could swing blocks of votes 
by agreeing to include various legislators in the government but 
he offered no specifics 
noting his gains in the second round he jokingly told reporters 
and supporters outside the great kremlin palace that i need 531 
that means we should go for five rounds and every round we will 
add six votes 
he said he expected polozkov to withdraw in favor of another 
gorbachev supporter yuri a manayenkov first secretary of the 
communist party organization in the lipetsk region in southern 
russia 
the first candidate backed by gorbachev russian premier 
alexander vlasov withdrew from the race friday after it became 
clear he lacked yeltsins popularity 
the race for the russian presidency marks the latest stage in a 
remarkable political comeback for yeltsin 59 who was ousted as 
moscow party chief in 1987 after urging gorbachev to speed up the 
reforms 
as yeltsin left the red walls of the ancient kremlin he avoided 
a crowd of several hundred supporters waiting in red square 
two women handed him bouquets of flowers one woman fell to her 
knees in front of him but he raised her to her feet and said 
please dont then stepped into a waiting car 
the car drove past the adjacent rossiya hotel where about 300 
more yeltsin backers chanted his name and the word referendum 
demanding a direct presidential vote 
this election has been undemocratic said legislator viktor 
aksyuchits addressing the crowd through a bullhorn we demand 
that the voice of russian citizens be heard 
olga yulitova a doctor said the people want yeltsin but 
our opinions dont matter the communist party apparatus is 
against him 
police looked on but did not interfere with the demonstration 
yeltsin told reporters he believed a direct vote for president 
of russia would be the most objective means of settling the 
race 
nominations will take place again on monday i think that i 
will be nominated and instead of polozkov manayenkov will be 
nominated yeltsin said 
he urged gorbachev to take a step forward and come halfway i 
am ready to meet him halfway 
asked what step he wanted gorbachev to take yeltsin said he 
should withdraw his criticism 
at least he should not say the words he said in the hall he 
said

actor don johnson says hes satisfied after 
an arbitrator ruled that parts of his house were poorly built and 
the contractor was ordered to pay damages 
the people who did the actual work will finally be paid 
johnson said after the hearing 
the contractor duddyviele construction inc of vail sued 
johnson in november after he refused to make a final payment of 
95813 on the 604085 job but the settlement requires 
duddyviele to pay johnson and subcontractors nearly 112000 said 
johnsons publicist elliot mintz 
johnson earlier had said he was withholding payment because 
floors and beams in the woody creek home were cracked and sagging 
plumbing leaked and backed up and doors and windows were not 
airtight 
a panel of three arbitrators visited the home and took 
testimony from johnson and other witnesses mintz said 
johnsons attorney robert shoecraft said that much of the 
money duddyviele claimed johnson owed it was actually money 
duddyviele owed subcontractors 
duddyviele must pay more than 64000 to subcontractors and 
47900 to johnson to compensate him for the costs to remedy the 
defective workmanship said mintz 
mike ellis of duddyviele said friday that no company officials 
would be available to comment on the settlement until after 
memorial day

received last month from bellarmine college comes from a school

said but at home college officials havent practiced what they 
pretend to preach 
the letter congratulated walesa on receiving the award which is 
given to those who exemplify charity justice and temperateness 
in dealing with controversy 
but it also said the college has awarded multimilliondollar 
construction contracts to companies that exploit their workers 
by paying wages below union scale and refusing to provide health 
insurance 
college spokesmen said friday that the school does not 
discriminate between union and nonunion contractors bids for 
construction are awarded based on the lowest and best bidder

a modernday mother hubbard who allegedly had 
54 children in her suburban maryland home when authorities raided 
it last week was described saturday by a neighbor as a lot of 
help to people who couldnt afford licensed care 
she was real particular about the children said albert h 
abney 44 who lives two houses down from nannie marie pressley in 
the washington suburb of oxon hill md 
authorities who searched mrs pressleys home on thursday said a 
lone teenager was keeping watch over the children ranging from 
infants to 10yearolds 
authorities said 13 infants were in bedrooms on the first floor 
of the twostory house and nine of those infants were in infant 
car seats authorities said the older children sat on benches in 
the basement 
mrs pressley 53 was served with a letter telling her to stop 
caring for children in her home said ardis welch a spokeswoman 
for the maryland department of human resources 
the case has been referred to prosecutors authorities said but 
prince georges county police lt mark a wright said saturday he 
had not been asked to help serve any criminal warrants 
ms welch said its a misdemeanor punishable with up to a 500 
fine to operate day care from a home without a license the state 
limit on home care is six children she added 
felony charges can be brought if there is evidence of abuse or 
unsafe conditions she said 
mrs pressley did not immediately return a telephone call 
seeking comment saturday 
ms welch said the raid was the result of a complaint since 
state authorities lack the resources to search for unlicensed home 
providers 
the need is too great and the practice is too pervasive she 
said 
abney said mrs pressley fulfilled such a need 
she was a lot of help to a lot of people who couldnt afford 
to pay 50 to 75 a week for day care abney said mrs 
pressley would charge people 15 to 20 and maybe a little more 
mrs pressley often let women get by without paying accumulated 
bills as high as 400 he said i used to tell her she was crazy 
for doing that 
he said a lot of the clients were young single mothers she 
couldnt say no to that mother 
im not sure id know the woman if id see her said another 
neighbor from across the busy fourlane street but the neighbor 
who asked to remain anonymous said she was aware that day care was 
being offered she said the exterior of the house was maintained 
very nicely 
another neighbor who asked that his name not be used said he 
noticed more and more younger girls bringing their children by 
for help 
the neighbor who has lived near mrs pressley for about eight 
years and said she has been caring for children that long added 
i think people did depend on her if she wasnt that good 
she wouldnt be in business that long 
he said the neighborhood of modestly priced homes was occupied 
by working people and a large number of retirees 
in an interview published in saturday editions of the washington 
post mrs pressley acknowledged that she cared for children 
without a license but usually cared for no more than 20 
she said there were so many children because she had been giving 
a birthday party she had left the children temporarily with her 
teenage daughter when she went to the store for supplies mrs 
pressley said 
yeah i know it was wrong mrs pressley said about keeping 
kids without a license sometimes people ask you can i bring my 
baby over and you have to say yes 
mrs pressley told the newspaper the children were in the 
basement because they had been watching a videotape 
the post described the interior of the house as immaculate and 
well furnished 
labor department figures say 57 percent of all women with 
children under 6 work outside the home compared with 12 percent in 
1950 the childrens defense fund a washingtonbased advocacy 
group predicts that by 1995 twothirds of all preschool children 
will have working mothers 
ms welch said she was unaware of any other instance of finding 
so many children being cared for in one home

here is the text of the statement 
released saturday by the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine as translated from arabic into english by the associated 
press 
as a result of the latest crime committed by zionism the foster 
daughter of america international changes have emerged in the 
reactions which required the organization of islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine to take time in declaring its position 
until all reactions had been scrutinized 
a big storm has been unleashed hardly anyone has been left 
without condemning and declaring profound dismay a unique global 
outrage was triggered off but it was clear that it was only an 
artificial patronage of our peoples security against the 
executioners and their masters the bloodletting continued it was 
a hollow storm of empty words representing a new method to diffuse 
the anger of the honest freedomloving strugglers and manifesting 
the orchestrated conspiratorial role of the international community 
against our sacred cause 
the organization of islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine declares that the effective deterrent is force america 
is directly responsible for shedding the blood of our people and 
our cause america seeks at all costs to retain its base israel 
in the east and will not permit even verbal resolutions of an 
adverse nature against israel 
we warn america and israel that future developments will not be 
in the interests of either of them they will realize that the 
blood will not be wasted they will pay the price 
lastly we address warm tribute to our struggling people in 
palestine and call for redoubled action and uprising 
have patience for dawn will be coming 
peace upon those who serve justice for the sake of justice

grassroots activists from around the 
world came together saturday with songs shouts and sad stories of 
radiation damage in soviet kazakhstan and they discussed ways to 
halt all nuclear testing 
were poisoning our air were poisoning our soil were 
poisoning our water former bombmaker ted taylor told 
participants in the fourday conference the us nuclear physicist 
said americans and soviets are more likely to be killed by the 
pollution from their own nuclear testing than by an enemy bomb 
although superpower tensions are easing the activists decided 
they have virtually no hope of persuading us british and french 
leaders to stop testing nuclear bombs anytime soon the united 
states detonated an underground bomb on friday 
the activists are concentrating instead on soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev said dr bernard lown an organizer of the 
conference and president of international physicians for the 
prevention of nuclear war 
the conference was highlighted by saturdays festive 
multinational rally and a political victory for the hosts a kazakh 
nuclear group called nevadasemipalatinsk named after the us and 
soviet test sites 
on wednesday kazakhstans legislature voted unanimously to ask 
the soviet government to halt all nuclear explosions at 
semipalatinsk located in the northern steppes of the central asian 
republic 
the american delegation to the conference in contrast was 
outraged to learn their government had set off another underground 
nuclear explosion in nevada 
i feel ashamed and angered lown said this makes no 
sense why are we conducting nuclear tests just a few days before 
the summit 
gorbachev is to meet president bush in washington this week and 
the superpowers hope to complete an agreement to reduce longrange 
nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
the activists sent a telegram urging the leaders to halt nuclear 
testing but no serious discussion of the issue is expected at the 
summit lown said quoting soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze 
conference leaders met with shevardnadze on tuesday in moscow 
where he restated the soviet willingness to stop nuclear testing if 
the united states does 
bush and gorbachev are expected to sign protocols on verifying 
compliance to a 150kiloton ceiling for nuclear tests although a 
pair of treaties setting the ceiling were signed in the early 
1970s they have never been ratified by the us senate and 
previous american administrations expressed doubt about soviet 
compliance 
us policy outlined by an american diplomat in moscow is that 
exploding nuclear bombs under the nevada desert is necessary for 
testing safety and new weapons 
but the kazakhs of central asia have used gorbachevs policies 
of glasnost and democratization to temporarily halt the blasts and 
pollution they blame for health problems semipalatinsk has been 
silent since october 
at the conference participants saw a graphic documentary film 
called testing ground which mixed scenes of deformed local 
children with film clips of mushroom clouds blasting sheep off the 
soviet prairies 
still births have tripled near the test site since 1970 said 
dr samaim balmkhanoe assistant director of the local radiation 
research institute 
nevadasemipalatinsk led by a kazakh poet named olzhas 
suleimenoz had won a soviet government promise to end testing at 
semipalatinsk by 1993 but plans to move testing to novaya zemlya 
in the artic could be delayed 
the rally on saturday appeared to have official support giant 
bilingual banners in english russian and kazakh called for peace 
and truckloads of pastries were sold from staterun kiosks 
but local journalists said their coverage of the conference was 
being restricted by the staterun media suleimenoz said 
the government ordered the demonstration moved from a downtown 
square to a remote stadium where passersby would not be likely to 
join in turnout was less than 15000 instead of the expected 
50000 
the authorities are afraid of public action suleimenoz said 
in an interview at saturdays rally which ended with the crowd 
carrying him out of the stadium on their shoulders chanting his 
name 
if they dont show us support they will lose authority 
suleimanoz said communists and noncommunists alike are united 
here

mayor gavriil popov said saturday he would 
temporarily allow only muscovites to shop in the capitals stores 
for fear that continued mass panic buying would play into the hands 
of conservative forces 
the consumer fever began thursday after soviet premier nikolai 
i ryzhkov announced an economic reform plan that would triple 
bread prices july 1 and raise prices on most other goods in january 
as a direct result of the speech there has been a gigantic 
explosion of demand for anything that can be bought popov told a 
news conference at the moscow city council 
if muscovites enraged by empty stores riot that would only 
profit the conservative forces who are dreaming of provoking mass 
clashes that could serve as a pretext to bring on measures against 
perestroika he said 
in the past two days people have bought seven times as much 
flour and vegetable oil as usual and doubled their purchases of 
salt said yuri luzhkov head of the city councils executive 
committee 
he said a twoweek period during which wouldbe purchasers must 
show identification with their moscow addresses would allow time to 
calm the panic and let city officials work out other measures to 
cope with heightened demand the twoweek period is to begin monday 
many other regions of the country began similar residentsonly 
rules months ago and some have long been on a straight ration 
system requiring coupons for such basics as meat cheese and 
butter sugar is rationed throughout the soviet union 
but moscow long the countrys showcase remained relatively 
rich in goods and even had enough to supply an estimated 1 million 
outoftown visitors a day 
the sudden rush on the stores is a reason for frustration we 
were like the last bastion of a nonadministrative economy said 
sergei stankevich moscows deputy mayor 
stankevich and popov both members of the opposition group in 
the soviet congress and thus more radical in their thinking than 
president mikhail s gorbachev said the ryzhkov plan and its 
consequences showed it was time for the government to step down 
our government cant think ahead of events stankevich said 
this is a real weakness and its unimaginable that we still have 
this kind of government 
popov said people lacked confidence in the national supreme 
soviet which has the power to vote down the economic plan but has 
rarely defied the government 
city officials said they expected the residentsonly buying plan 
to provoke conflicts with the regions that surround moscow 
vladimir yaroslavl and tula whose inhabitants are used to buying 
many of their supplies in the capital but they said they would try 
to work out deals with regional leaders over the next two weeks 
residents of the greater moscow region will still be able to buy 
in the citys stores as will veterans and invalids from elsewhere 
popov said 
moscows stores have been packed since thursday with what 
stankevich called enormous lines of angry people they were 
trying to buy macaroni cereals and salt all usually among the few 
readily available food products in the shortageplagued soviet 
union 
lines at some food stores saturday evening were not longer than 
usual and shoppers interviewed at random said they were not buying 
up extra goods although they clearly were dissatisfied with the 
selection of what food was available 
popov said moscow had received offers from lithuania estonia 
and the crimea to supply it with food but did not specify whether 
it would circumvent the kremlins ministries and strike deals on 
its own 
ryzhkovs economic plan proposes a fiveyear transition to what 
it calls a market economy still partially regulated by the 
government 
it has drawn criticism from all sides lawmakers are angry over 
its price increases and the expected unemployment it will bring 
while western experts say it doesnt do enough to liquidate central 
control and introduce a real market 
the supreme soviet legislature is to continue discussing the 
plan early next week and a vote is not expected before tuesday

voters was 3 percent for democrats and republicans only the 
margin of error was 5 percent

cashier sofia martikina waved her arms toward the 
dozens of people jamming a nearby counter to buy sausage and lard 
its just outrageous she said they are sweeping up 
everything there is no salt or macaroni left 
at a bakery down the street nargiza nargieva clutched a loaf of 
brown bread as she spoke of the impending government plan to triple 
the prices of bakery goods on july 1 and the crush of shoppers back 
home in tbilisi the capital of soviet georgia 
its been that way for about a week she said of the run on 
the stores in the caucasus republic in georgia we are very much 
afraid of bread price increases there is nothing left neither 
bread nor cheese 
mrs nargieva who on saturday bought a dress imported from 
hungary before heading back to tbilisi on monday seemed genuinely 
surprised at new temporary restrictions that would prevent 
outoftowners from buying goods in moscow stores 
we just cant believe that anything like that selling things 
on passports can happen in the soviet union she said i 
cant believe that its very bad 
in reality some other regions in the country adopted 
residentsonly rules months ago moscows planned restrictions are 
being put into effect to curb panicbuying that city officials say 
has been occurring in the capital since an economic reform plan was 
announced thursday 
another woman in the bakery who refused to give her name was 
pleased with the rule in which residents of moscow would have to 
show their propiska a stamp in their internal passports to 
shop at the citys stores 
im a muscovite and i think its good she said there 
will be fewer crowds in the shops and we will be able to buy 
anything without a fuss 
but mrs martikina the cashier wasnt so sure 
i dont know how i will feel when a woman with a young child 
comes up to me to buy milk and i have to refuse on the grounds she 
has no propiska mrs martikina said does the fact that shes 
not a muscovite mean that she has to starve she and her child 
its just awful 
shoppers interviewed at random on a drizzly saturday evening 
said they had not done any hoarding of goods themselves and had not 
seen their neighbors buying extra 
alexandra sergeyeva standing in a slowmoving line along with 
more than 60 other people to buy about 2 pounds of the grayish 
wrinkled sausages on sale said she has not been stocking up on 
food 
i dont have any place to store it she said adding that if 
she did have extra shelf space she would be buying more goods 
well anyway i dont have that much money but i could afford 
another kilo she said the store was limiting shoppers to two 
kilograms almost 4 pounds 
yes i heard that prices will go up mrs sergeyeva said 
you know i dont think the countrys economy is going to be 
saved for ordinary people its going to be worse its not that 
they will suffer that much but they will be much poorer 
further up the line svetlana kireichnenkova who has a husband 
and two children said the planned price increases are going to 
adversely affect my family 
mrs kireichnenkova described herself as an outoftowner and 
had heard about the new rules for moscow shoppers but did not want 
to speculate about her future 
i dont really feel up to making forecasts she said we 
shall live and see

executives at a denver television station have 
defended their staffs videotaping of an illegal pit bull fight as 
legitimate newsgathering activities 
roger ogden general manager of kcnctv on friday said station 
employees attended such a fight in september but they didnt 
realize at the time that it was illegal 
he also said the tape used in reporter wendy bergens fourpart 
series on illegal pit bull fights came from a confidential source 
we have been told and we believe that this video was not the 
same fight attended by kcnc employees in september the station 
said in a statement 
the station and police agencies began an investigation this 
month after allegations were made by anonymous sources that kcnc 
staged a fight between two dogs for bergens series the sources 
also told competing news organizations the station paid for the 
fight 
kcnctv denied the allegations and ogden ordered a 
comprehensive investigation 
police said the fight featured in bergens report which aired 
april 30 through may 2 occurred on a grassy area near the south 
platte river in sheridan a denver suburb 
staging a dogfight or even attending one is a felony in 
colorado punishable by up to four years in prison and 1000 fine 
police investigations into the incident were completed this 
week district attorneys in arapahoe and jefferson counties where 
the fights reportedly occurred are looking into who might have 
been involved 
no charges have been filed against station employees or dog 
owners kcnctv news director marv rockford said no disciplinary 
action has been taken against any kcnc employee 
in a statement released friday kcnc defended its actions 
we believe the subject of pit bulls and pit bull fighting in 
colorado was and is a legitimate topic of public concern and 
interest and is an appropriate journalistic subject the unsigned 
statement said 
last september in the course of investigating the pit bull 
issue kcnc employees attended and videotaped a pit bull fight that 
took place in arapahoe county attendance and coverage of the fight 
was in the normal course of the stations activity in gathering the 
news and preparing the report the station later learned of the 
existence of a criminal statute relating to dogfighting 
we then contacted and met with robert gallagher the district 
attorney for arapahoe county and members of his staff to discuss 
whether journalists attending and videotaping a pit bull fight for 
the purpose of obtaining and reporting the news might be committing 
a criminal act 
while they indicated that it was their view that the statute 
might apply even in that situation kcnc did not and does not agree 
with any interpretation of the statute that would make criminal 
such legitimate newsgathering activities 
when the arapahoe county district attorneys office learned of 
kcncs statement it announced that a special prosecutor would be 
appointed to review the case 
but because of the holiday weekend it will be at least tuesday 
before the court appoints a special prosecutor

palestinian leader yasser arafat apparently 
sensing a cooling of relations between washington and jerusalem 
pleaded with the us government saturday to help along middle east 
peace by pressuring israel 
a un security council emergency session on the latest violence 
between irsaelis and arabs in the israelioccupied lands adjourned 
and was to resume tuesday in new york 
an arab diplomat said a council decision could be one week 
two weeks off 
arafat asked the 15nation council during the twoday session 
for sweeping un moves to protect arabs in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
at a news conference saturday arafat criticized the united 
states for shielding israel from international pressure and for 
vetoing critical security council resolutions 
in view of israeli dependence on us aid we are expecting 
the us administration and people to play a more effective role in 
bringing about peace the palestine liberation organization chief 
said through an interpreter 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud said the united states had 
tried to launch the idea in geneva of sending an international 
factfinding mission to the occupied territories but backtracked 
saturday under israeli pressure 
the us had been informally suggesting such a development and 
in our view flipflopped on its position maksoud told reporters 
it means israel still has a stranglehold on the decisionmaking 
process 
the us state department earlier said it was prepared to 
discuss having the security council send a temporary factfinding 
mission to the occupied lands 
that put washington publicly at odds with israel which said it 
would bar any observer team 
us ambassador thomas pickering suggested a likely move would 
be dispatching a personal representative of un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to look into the situation in the 
territories this has been done before 
the direction in which were looking is something that might 
come from the secretarygeneral in that regard pickering said 
after the meeting 
secretary of state james a baker iii raised the possibility 
friday when he said washington would not oppose such a mission 
pickering did not speak in the council meeting 
arafat in an unprecedented speech to the council friday 
appealed for a un emergency force to protect the 17 million 
arabs in the occupied lands and he urged sanctions against israel 
a us official made plain saturday that washington would veto 
any council resolution containing those points there are 
obviously elements of the speech we dont agree with the 
official said on condition of anonymity 
a un emergency team would include representatives of several 
countries rather than personal representatives of perez de cuellar 
and would presumably mount a wider probe than a special envoy 
the security council convened at arab behest after an israeli

the state department on saturday warned that 
americans traveling in the philippines face an increased risk of 
terrorism as the two countries prepare for a new set of 
negotiations on us military bases in the island nation 
during this period communist elements in the philippines are 
likely to expand their current terrorism campaign beyond us 
officials and active duty us servicemen to include retired 
personnel and the places they frequent the department said in a 
statement 
american and philippine negotiators are preparing to resume 
talks on whether to renew a lease on clark air base subic bay 
naval base and four smaller installations the leases expire in 
september 1991 
opposition to the bases is growing because many filipinos view 
them as an infringement on national sovereignty 
the state department said that most of the major tourist 
destinations and most urban areas generally have not experienced 
the type of civil disorder noted in its advisory 
but it added because of criminal activities travelers should 
exercise caution at night in the downtown entertainment districts 
of major cities and should avoid travel to remote mountainous 
areas

prosecutors want the lawyer of charles stuart who 
apparently committed suicide after his wifes mysterious shooting 
death to break attorneyclient privilege two newspapers reported 
saturday 
suffolk county prosecutors are seeking to force lawyer john t 
dawley to tell a grand jury what he knows of the events surrounding 
the october shooting that left carol stuart and her prematurely 
born son dead 
stuart who also was shot originally blamed the attack on a 
black robber and summoned police help with a dramatic call from 
his car telephone 
the request to order dawley to testify came in a closed hearing 
last month appeals court judge edith fine on friday ordered the 
court to release a condensed transcript of the hearing following an 
appeal by the boston herald 
superior court judge james donohue has asked the states 
appellate court to rule on the prosecutors request the herald and 
the boston globe reported saturday 
at the closed hearing assistant district attorney thomas mundy 
argued that shortly before stuart apparently jumped to his death 
off a bridge five months ago he told dawley of his plot to kill 
his wife 
mundy said stuarts brother matthew was a potential target of 
the grand jurys investigation and indicated that dawleys 
testimony could shed light on matthew stuarts possible role in the 
killings 
the inferences point that he may well have told dawley exactly 
what occurred and that information may be very important to the 
grand jurys determination as to what inference they wish to draw 
from matthew stuarts purported statements to several witnesses in 
determining what charges to bring mundy said in his argument 
before donohue 
matthew stuart told police he thought he was involved in an 
insurance scam when he drove to the citys mission hill section to 
meet his brother shortly after the shooting 
matthew stuart allegedly disposed of the gun police believe was 
used in the shooting as well as other items he said he believed 
would later be reported stolen 
he also said he did not recognize mrs stuart in his brothers 
car but mistook her body for a duffle bag or laundry bag 
mundy said he believed the interest of the grand jury in 
resolving this very serious crime i would submit in the interest 
of justice overrides the privilege protecting clientlawyer 
communications 
nancy gertner a lawyer for matthew stuart argued at the 
hearing that no massachusetts case law gives precedent for 
overriding the attorneyclient privilege in the interest of justice 
and in addition the kind of evidence even if mr dawley were 
permitted to testify would not be admissible in a proceeding 
likely to come out of this gertner said

a vatican envoy said saturday that rival 
christian leaders agreed to end their 4monthold war that has left 
more than 1000 people dead but new sniping reportedly claimed 
three lives 
in south lebanon palestinian guerrillas ambushed a convoy of 
israelibacked militiamen inflicting an undisclosed number of 
casualties and losing four of their men lebanese security sources 
reported an israeli spokesman said no militiamen were killed 
in lebanons other factional power struggle syrian troops 
intervened early saturday to halt 15 hours of street battles in 
west and south beirut between rival shiite moslem factions that 
fighting reportedly left five people dead and 42 wounded 
vatican ambassador pablo puente told a news conference that 
christian gen michel aoun and fellow christian samir geagea a 
militia chieftain had agreed that a 9dayold ceasefire will 
become a permanent truce puente said the rival leaders made the 
pledges separately to him and also vowed to release all prisoners 
neither leader provided immediate confirmation 
they have been fighting for control of lebanons christian 
enclave which comprises east beirut and nearby coastal communities 
despite puentes announcement police said aouns troops and 
geageas lebanese forces militiamen exchanged intermittent sniper 
fire in east beirut killing three people and wounding one 
the latest casualties raised the toll to 1035 killed and 2770 
wounded since the power struggle broke out jan 30 
independent observers doubt the power struggle will end until 
aoun and geagea work out a political settlement and somehow 
overcome their deepseated hatred of each other 
aoun controls 19000 troops geageas militia includes 6000 
core fighters who are backed by about 30000 reservists 
before agreeing to the ceasefire may 17 the two forces had 
fought each other to a standstill 
geagea has accused aoun of trying to destroy his militia the 
general charges geagea with plotting against the christians 
interest by trying to enforce a peace accord brokered by arab 
nations to end lebanons 15yearold civil war between christians 
and moslems 
the accord endorsed by lebanons parliament in saudi arabia in 
october gives moslems equal power with the traditionally dominant 
christians 
aoun rejects that accord complaining it does not guarantee the 
withdrawal of 40000 syrian troops from lebanon they have been 
deployed since 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate and 
they now control most of lebanons territory 
in the south lebanon fighting the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine said in a series of statements from beirut 
that its fighters carried out saturdays attack to avenge the 
massacre of seven palestinian workers by an israeli gunman near tel 
aviv on may 20 
lebanese security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said a guerrilla force detonated three remotecontrol bombs on a 
road inside israels selfdesignated security zone north of the 
border with the jewish state as the mostly christian south lebanon 
army convoy passed the sla works in concert with israeli forces 
but an israeli army spokesman in tel aviv said there were no sla 
casualties but reported that the militiamen killed four guerrillas 
he made no mention of bombs 
the israeli version indicated that an sla patrol intercepted an 
infiltration attempt not that the militiamen were ambushed 
however a lebanese source said the sla convoy of two armored 
personnel carriers and two jeeps was hit near shebaa in the eastern 
sector of the israeli zone 
in the moslem power struggle police said the situation remained 
very tense after syrian troops moved in to stop the beirut 
fighting authorities said the mainstream syrianbacked amal 
movement and the fundamentalist proiranian hezbollah or party of 
god were keeping their fighters on alert 
amal and hezbollah have been battling sporadically for 2 years 
for control of lebanons 12 million shiites the countrys largest 
sect at least 1049 people have been killed and 3136 wounded 
during that time

mikhail s gorbachev says the question of 
whether a unified germany should belong to nato is certain to 
produce a major disagreement in his coming summit with president 
bush but i do expect the differences to be narrowed time 
magazine reports 
i hope the character of the relationship ive developed with 
the president will permit us to move forward rather than backward 
in our discussions gorbachev said in an interview with the 
magazine tuesday at his office in moscow the transcript of the 
session appears in the june 4 edition of the magazine 
on friday gorbachev told a press conference that the soviet 
union will keep hundreds of thousands of troops in eastern germany 
and will review its approach to european armscontrol talks if a 
united germany joins nato the us and west german governments 
have insisted that membership in the alliance is imperative 
president bush meanwhile told reporters saturday he will try 
to convince gorbachev the soviet union would not be threatened by a 
united germany in nato 
i think its going to take a while before we have agreement on 
how a postgerman unification europe looks bush said my job 
is to convince him that there is no threat to the soviet union from 
a united germany in nato and im absolutely convinced there is no 
threat to him and i think its stabilizing 
in the session with time gorbachev said that politically we 
are already entering a new phase that should be characterized by 
the establishment of permanent security structures instead of nato 
and the warsaw treaty organization 
i envision europe as a union of states with common 
institutions to assure military and environmental security along 
with cooperation in science and culture the soviet president 
said each state would retain its local and national character 
and have the right to protect is special interests without 
prejudice to others 
you ask how my approach differs from that of president bush 
indeed there are some differences according to the american 
scenario as far as i can tell nato and that means a nato 
strengthened by the inclusion of a unified germany should be the 
foreman and guarantor in the building of a new european order 
gorbachev said 
i can understand that americans and many europeans have their 
own perception of this organization he went on they give it 
credit for keeping peace throughout the cold war on that basis we 
are being told the role of nato in the new phase as well will be 
entirely positive and will even serve the interests of the soviet 
union but thats just not serious for our people too nato is 
associated with the cold war but as an organization designed from 
the start to be hostile to the soviet union as a force that 
whipped up the arms race and the danger of war 
regardless of what is being said about nato now for us it is 
a symbol of the past a dangerous and confrontational past and we 
will never agree to assign it the leading role in building a new 
europe i want us to be understood correctly on this 
gorbachev at another point was asked whether he expected the 
issue to lead to a major disagreement at the summit his coming 
week i wouldnt say i expect a major disagreement ill state 
for a fact that there will be one he replied but i do expect 
the differences to be narrowed as a result of my discussions with 
president bush 
on other topics gorbachev 
conceded his domestic economic reforms are likely to trigger 
serious inflation and unemployment as the nation moves toward a 
market economy you have to bear in mind that we have quite a few 
factories that are simply inefficient he said theyre 
going to have to reorient their production people will have to be 
retrained many will have to find new occupations 
said it would be an environmental catastrophe if other 
nations including his own tried to achieve the standard of living 
enjoyed by americans america already consumes a disproportionate 
percentage of the worlds energy resources he said thats why 
i stress the conflict between consumer society and nature 
defended his tough stance against the independence moves of the 
baltic states saying as president i took an oath of office to 
uphold the constitution we are looking for a way to restore 
constitutional order and authority and to do so by political 
means let me just stop there particularly because recently weve 
seen some new and encouraging signs 
said a return to the cold war is hardly possible now 
because we have learned too much about each other to be able to 
revert to old preconceptions and ideological cliches

thirtyone people were killed and 
hundreds of thousands left homeless by last weekends earthquake 
and strong aftershocks in southern sudan government and rebel 
officials said saturday 
thirty people were killed at kuonwei near the city of bor 669 
miles south of khartoum said the sudan relief and rehabilitation 
association in nairobi kenya the association is the relief arm of 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army 
it said the may 20 quake sent homes tumbling into the river nile 
a spokesman for the rebel relief group james nduku said 
another person was killed and two buildings collapsed in the 
village of lafan near torit 790 miles south of khartoum 
because of the remoteness of the area reports about the effects 
of the earthquake have trickled in slowly 
the quake measured 74 on the richter scale capable of causing 
widespread damage in a populated area but much of southern sudans 
population has been displaced by famine and the countrys 
7yearold civil war 
brig dominique kasiano a member of sudans ruling junta and 
political supervisor of the southern equatoria region said every 
government building and many homes were destroyed in terakeka a 
nile river garrison town 55 miles north of southern sudans main 
city juba 
he appealed for international help for quake victims 
the government said about 300000 people were left homeless 
officials of western relief agencies and the rebel relief group 
said they had no knowledge of the situation in terakeka but 
questioned government figures on the number of people left homeless 
in cairo the head of egypts monitoring service said the units 
seismographs have recorded almost continuous aftershocks since 
thursday when a strong aftershock struck monitoring stations 
measured it at 71 on the richter scale 
a number of houses and buildings have been reported damaged in 
juba 750 miles south of khartoum whose population has been 
swelled by refugees no injuries have been reported in juba 
however 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 71 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 61

yugoslavias communist party on 
saturday called for nationwide multiparty elections and formally 
renounced its monopoly on political power at a national congress 
but the congress was boycotted by communist party members from 
three of yugoslavias six constituent republics and analysts said 
it is doubtful the latest moves by the party will help restore its 
sagging national power 
in a rare commentary the leading macedonian daily nova 
makedonija said saturdays session represents the definite end 
of the communist party of yugoslavia since only three of the six 
republics took part in the session 
delegates from slovenia croatia and macedonia refused to join 
in the resumption of the 14th communist party congress that broke 
up in disarray at its last meeting in january 
communists suffered resounding defeats in recent local 
multiparty elections in slovenia and croatia the first free 
elections in yugoslavia in 50 years 
delegates from the three republics that boycotted the meeting 
claimed the resumed congress was organized by hardliners intent on 
maintaining their leading role at a time when parts of the country 
are already moving toward democracy 
the january congress was suspended when slovenias delegates 
left the hall after losing a vote on reforms to hardliners 
participating in saturdays gathering were communists from 
serbia the largest republic montenegro and bosniahercegovina 
delegates at the threehour session adopted a statement waiving 
the partys leading role in society and called for free national 
elections 
the most important thing is that the party be radically 
reformed into a modern political party said communist party 
acting president miomir grbovic in his opening speech 
yugoslavias communist party continues to rule at the federal 
level but its power has been crippled since centerright parties 
won elections in slovenia and croatia 
multiparty elections are also planned in bosniahercegovina and 
macedonia 
many political analysts doubt the communist party can restore 
the authority it has lost after over a decade of ethnic and 
political squabbles and economic mismanagement 
saturdays session decided that a congress of democratic 
renewal will be held on september 29 and the communist party will 
take part in future free elections at the federal level 
the adopted document said the radically renewed party will 
try to unite all leftist political groups within yugoslavia 
the party still enjoys the support of the working class and 
will continue to rely on it in the future grbovic said but he 
admitted the partys reputation has drastically declined 
throughout yugoslavia 
nijaz durakovic head of the party in bosniahercegovina told 
the gathering the communists must show the rightwing parties 
that we are able to unite and function successfully in a multiparty 
environment 
serbian communists are still firmly entrenched in their 
republic serbia is the only one of yugoslavias six states that 
has failed to schedule multiparty elections

vice president dan quayle a selfdescribed 
racing buff hoofed the soggy three miles of the indianapolis 
500 festival parade with his wife and three children saturday 
quayle wife marilyn and children tucker benjamin and corinne 
were whisked into a building to wait out a 30minute downpour 
before the festivities began 
but the weather at least stayed dry during the 2hour parade 
i cant believe hes walking said janie charles who waited 
to ride an oldfashioned bicycle in the parade as quayle bodyguards 
tucked umbrellas into an escort car 
quayle the first sitting vice president to serve as parade 
grand marshal said the role was unquestionably in character for 
him 
ive been to the race close to 20 times thats about half the 
years of my life the 43yearold vice president said 
the quayles were joined by several celebrities and the races 33 
drivers who rode in open convertibles over the sopping wet 
blackandwhite checked carpet near the reviewing stand 
bands from as far away as south dakota and texas marched and 
played while gigantic balloons of raggedy ann and popeye floated 
high above the soggy crowd 
gov evan bayh and indianapolis mayor william h hudnut also 
took part in the parade as did showtime comedian jeff altman and 
actor norman fell 
quayle a former senator from indiana said getting to the race 
this year would be a lot more convenient than when he lived in his 
hometown of huntington or was in law school in indianapolis 
were going to fly over traffic this year he said 
but there was something that was fun to get to the track 
by some sort of back road he added 
wed usually get about a half a mile from the race track it 
was a little bit of a challenge to do that hauling the picnic 
basket 
quayle attended last years race as a spectator 
organizers of saturdays nationally televised parade said the 
rain kept attendance down to less than 100000 
we usually dont get to see any of the parade said tim 
oconnor a hot dog vendor and sevenyear parade regular whos 
usually too busy selling wed usually be out of pop by now but 
we cant give it away he said 
as of late saturday afternoon the forecast for sundays race 
included clouds and a 30 percent chance of rain the start was 
set for noon edt

george bushs second gettogether with mikhail 
s gorbachev shapes up as a summit of lowered expectations 
there will be no treaty signed to limit longrange nuclear 
missiles no announcement of a dramatic increase in trade between 
the united states and the soviet union 
other differences also will be felt moscows resistance to 
german unity its pressure on rebellious lithuania to rejoin the 
soviet fold and the slow pace of talks to call home hundreds of 
thousands of troops and tanks from europe 
an agreement will be signed to destroy chemical weapons and a 
statement will be issued announcing limits on cruise missiles an 
important step toward a broader treaty cutting the deadliest 
weapons in the superpowers arsenals 
but much of the three days of talks will be given over to 
discussing issues on which the superpowers are at loggerheads 
weve got a lot of things to discuss that might not result in 
a signed agreement bush said last week adding theres 
enormous problems that just need to be talked about 
yet he told reporters i dont want to have two ships pass in 
the night the united states and the soviet union 
recognizing the two leaders fondness for springing surprises 
many experts believe that something unexpected will emerge from the 
summit but probably nothing earthshaking 
they are almost compelled to pull one or two rabbits out of 
the hat but theyre going to be fairly small rabbits predicted 
robert w tucker a soviet specialist at the johns hopkins school 
of advanced international studies 
the administration always low balls summits said robert 
hunter a soviet expert at the center for strategic and 
international studies its the new hampshire primary syndrome 
possible steps toward progress include further compromises for a 
pact covering longrange nuclear missiles where differences 
already have been narrowed significantly or pledges to revive 
slowly moving negotiations on a treaty to slash the superpowers 
european armies and stores of conventional arms 
tucker said the real importance of the summit is that it 
continues the string of superpower meetings 
its part of the long and complicated and arduous process of 
winding down the cold war and the differences that remain between 
us tucker said 
aside from striving for progress in arms talks bush will press 
gorbachev to allow a united germany to be a part of the usled 
nato alliance 
at stake said secretary of state james a baker iii is 
the reconciliation of a people and of a continent too long divided 
and the future of a legitimate and stable european order 
yet moscow has refused at least publicly to budge from its 
opposition to a united germany in nato fearing a shift in the 
balance of power in europe 
bush will press gorbachev on the pace of negotiations in vienna 
aimed at reducing the us and soviet forces and conventional arms 
in europe 
as the president said thursday the talks havent gone as far 
or as fast as i would like to see maybe we can find some way 
at the summit to move cfe the talks forward 
the bush administration feels moscow has slowed the pace of the 
discussions on a conventional forces in europe treaty in part 
because it wants the large west german army scaled back 
on this issue there may be signs of movement 
last week soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said 
moscow advocates an acceleration in the vienna negotiations he 
rejected the notion that moscows concerns over the west german 
army have made his government hesitant to sign a cfe agreement 
moreover west german officials who met with shevardnadze say 
they think the us assessment of soviet concerns may be a 
misunderstanding 
lithuania also promises in bushs words to put some tension 
on the summit 
baker said recently that a good bit of the presidents time 
will be spent discussing the moves by baltic states to become 
independent of the soviet union and gorbachevs pressure to keep 
them in the fold 
gorbachev facing tests of his power at an important communist 
party congress in july likely will be unwilling to give up too 
much to bush experts say 
gorbachevs playing a very weak hand but hes playing it so 
well hes made himself look like an equal said hunter 
his objective is not to humiliate the president but to be seen 
as a member of the club its bushs interest to be as 
forthcoming with gorbachev as he can while gorbachev is doing what 
we want him to do hunter said they have a mutual interest in 
success at this summit 
gorbachev is interested in any help bush can offer for the 
battered soviet economy but that help at least for now wont 
include the trade concessions that once had been expected from the 
bush administration 
the united states will not grant the soviet union preferential 
mostfavorednation status because the soviet legislature has not 
passed legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration 
us law prohibits the president from granting such concessions 
to any nation determined to be denying its citizens the right to 
leave 
on the other hand bush recently loosened restrictions on sales 
to moscow of hightech products such as computers and precision 
milling equipment 
the two presidents also will discuss the unfulfilled efforts to 
sign a treaty limiting strategic arms 
while bush and gorbachev will declare their intention to reduce 
the numbers of their longrange nuclear bombers missiles and 
submarines by onethird the formal agreement they once had hoped 
to sign is not even close to being ready 
gorbachev arrives in washington wednesday evening as a leader 
enjoying widespread popularity on the international stage but 
strapped by immense problems at home 
his economy is wrecked his nation is torn by nationalist 
uprisings his farflung communist empire virtually is gone 
by contrast bush remains high in the public opinion polls and 
deals from a position of strength even though he is wrestling with 
difficult deficit problems 
yet bush does not want to undermine gorbachev or push him from 
power because he has been the champion of soviet reforms and 
allowed eastern europe to break free from moscow 
despite his problems gorbachev appears in control 
whether we like what he is doing whether we are unhappy with 
what he is doing the buck in the soviet government today stops 
with him said dimitri k simes a soviet expert at the carnegie 
endowment for international peace 
beginning thursday bush and gorbachev will hold two days of 
talks at the white house on saturday they will retreat to the 
privacy of camp david for a day of discussions on troublesome 
political issues 
it is at the presidential retreat bush said last week that he 
expects he and gorbachev can sit and talk about relations 
between the two superpowers 
the summit will end sunday morning when the two leaders hold a 
wrapup news conference in the chandeliered east room of the white 
house 
the planned showpiece of the summit will be the signing friday 
evening of the agreements to destroy chemical weapons and clamp 
longsought limits on air and sealaunched cruise missiles

striking railworkers and government 
representatives broke off talks saturday after failing to settle a 
walkout that has crippled transportation nationwide 
the strike over a wage dispute has tested the resolve of the 
government reformers who have imposed a strict program to shock 
the economy back to life the government has flatly rejected pay 
increases as an inflationary threat to the economic overhaul plan 
imposed on jan 1 
i am willing to talk with everybody about everything 
except wages said labor minister jacek kuron of the 
solidarityled government there will be no change of the 
governments stand 
strike committee member janusz zaborowski said his negotiating 
team would return to its headquarters in the northwest city of 
slupsk to decide on its next move 
we came to warsaw in good faith and our outstretched arm was 
rejected yet again zaborowski said the only constructive 
effect of the talks was that both sides agreed the strikes are over 
purely economic issues and not politics 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki reiterated friday that despite 
sympathy for the sufferings of poles under the economic reforms he 
would not give to the strikers demands 
lech walesa leader of the solidarity trade union said the 
workers grievences were real but said a strike was not the 
appropriate answer 
the strikes began may 20 and quickly spread across northwest 
poland 
but the protest eased slightly saturday when strikers at gdansk 
harbor and in at least one other area agreed to allow limited 
passenger service as good will gestures 
the first signs of progress came friday night when 42 hunger 
strikers six of them hospitalized suspended their fast and three 
rail stations in northcentral poland were reopened pending the 
outcome of negotiations 
but rail traffic to the baltic coast remained closed on saturday 
and the countrys busiest port szczecin was paralyzed the 
transport ministry said 72 passenger trains had been canceled 
saturday morning 
freight traffic to the ports from polands industrial south and 
hungary and czechoslovakia were also disrupted 
the army was called in to move essential freight but transport 
minister adam wieladek said saturday the military would not be used 
to run the railroad he said there were plans to replace major rail 
routes with bus and truck transport 
officials say thousands of the nations 400000 railroad 
workers were striking but gave no specific figures 
the governments economic reforms cut off huge government 
subsidies that allowed staterun industries including the 
railroad to charge unrealistically low rates the government has 
demanding that pay increases come from funds within the enterprise 
and have refused to make any exceptions 
strict wage controls coupled with a raise in prices to market 
levels has reduced real income by an estimated 40 percent 
strikers are demanding a raise in rail workers pay to 110 
percent of the average national wage of 79 as month and have asked 
for the dismissal of railroad directors installed under the former 
communist regime

aida that would have included a fivestory sphinx and about 
1200 performers was canceled because producers felt theyd lose 
too much money an official said saturday

and the producers felt income would not cover expenses said tony 
attanasio marketing director for the international opera festival

at giants stadium in east rutherford across the hudson river from 
new york city and 30000 tickets had been sold attanasio said

had contracted with concert production international to run the 
show attanasio said in a telephone interview from new york

tours by the rolling stones and david bowie 
they were trying to put on a good show attanasio said 
most of the trucks with the props had arrived in new york from 
toronto and work on building the stage and set was supposed to 
start monday they were just overwhelmed by the size of this 
production 
the production was to include a stage the length of a football 
field the fivestory replica of the sphinx the egyptian statue 
of a lion with the head of a man and about 1200 performers 
attanasio said 
the show was first performed in giza egypt in 1987 since 
then the production has been staged around the world and seen by 
about 850000 people 
concert production international decided to cancel friday in a 
decision that surprised festival officials he said 
a man answering the phone saturday at concert production 
international headquarters in toronto referred all questions to 
marketing director joe owens but said owens would not be reachable 
until monday 
the cancellation cost the production companies a combined 25 
million attanasio said

we have to go back to our old way of doing production 
produce it ourselves and do it one show at a time he said

cambodias four warring factions 
signed a truce and agreed to form a body to enforce it but one 
rebel leader said saturday that the accord would accomplish little 
if successful the truce would end the 11yearold civil war 
between the vietnambacked government in phnom penh and a 
threeparty guerrilla coalition 
however guerrilla and diplomatic sources say they expect 
renewed fighting prior to peace talks in tokyo as the guerrillas 
try to gain new ground and strengthen their bargaining positions 
the truce will go into effect when it is announced officially at 
the cambodian peace talks scheduled in tokyo june 45 said senior 
guerrilla sources who spoke on condition of anonymity saturday the 
parties also will announce that peace talks will be resumed in 
paris in july they said 
the guerrilla sources said the parties also agreed to the 
formation of a supreme national council that would include 
representatives from each faction and oversee the truce 
the rebels include the communist khmer rouge the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front and a faction loyal to 
coalition leader prince norodom sihanouk 
one guerrilla spokesman ok serei sopheak of the national 
liberation front said saturday a truce would not end the fighting 
it is only a document he said it is a play on words 
there will be no ceasefire on the ground 
another national liberation front ieng moly described the 
reported agreement as only a voluntary selfrestraint on the use 
of force there is no control no supervision 
the national liberation front launched major attacks friday 
against the governmentheld town of svay chek in northwestern 
cambodia guerrillas said that 4000 fighters were involved in the 
push 
we believe that an effective ceasefire must be controlled by 
the united nations ok serei sopheak said otherwise the 
fighting will continue we see a ceasefire as an element of a 
larger solution we wont get anything at all through a ceasefire 
alone 
thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan a key mediator in the 
conflict had said last week that the pact would be signed the 
guerrilla sources said the agreement had been initialed by thai 
defense minister gen chaovalit yongchaiyudh 
the khmer rouge is accused of killing a million cambodians when 
it ruled cambodia for 3 years during the 1970s vietnam invaded 
drove the khmer from power and installed another government 
the current government objects to any participation in a future 
government by the khmer rouge but china which supplies the 
guerrilla faction says it must be a part of any peace settlement

a memorial was dedicated saturday at the former 
site of camp douglas once a training camp for union soldiers 
many of them blacks and later a prison where thousands of 
confederate soldiers died 
more than a century later just six miles from the glitzy 
boutiques and department stores along chicagos magnificent mile 
no trace remains of the camp 
the heritage memorial wall honors the 6000 confederates who 
died in the prison camp of malnutrition disease and exposure and 
the thousands of union soldiers who enlisted at the training camp 
said ernest a griffin who financed the 20000 monument 
many soldiers from camp douglas are buried in mass graves at oak 
woods cemetery five miles away 
griffin said camp douglas was the unions main training site for 
black soldiers almost 200000 of whom served in the union army in 
a separate federal branch designated as the us colored troops 
for griffin the 6by6foot concrete memorial mostly represents 
his admiration for a grandfather who participated in a historic 
event 
the grandfather was pvt charles h griffin a civil war veteran 
who served in the 29th regiments company b of the us colored 
infantry

the members are often young girls who still 
play with dolls and know their dreams will come true but the 
adults that run the girls clubs of america see the harsher 
realities the girls face 
they see a tight economy expensive housing cheap drugs and 
other tough tests ahead for their 250000 young participants more 
than half of whom are members of minorities and come from poor 
singleparent urban homes 
in the face of those challenges the girls clubs has changed its 
name to girls inc and adopted a new slogan growing up is 
serious business 
these days the 45yearold 120affiliate national network 
balances lessons in baking pies with lessons in selling them 
the theme is to turn these girls into autonomous 
independent adults so they dont get stuck in some awful cycle 
without any hope said keven bellows who works for the new 
yorkbased national organization and directed the search for a new 
name 
she said the new name underscores the groups mission by 
moving away from the word club which suggests exclusivity and 
recreation 
it also should clarify the distinction between the organization 
and the increasingly coed boys clubs and girls inc bellows said 
however several of the oldest girls clubs like the one founded 
here 28 years before the national organization was chartered in 
1945 object to what they say is leaving a tradition behind 
this club played a very important role in the whole 
integration of women into society said nancy achin sullivan 
executive director of the girls club of lowell about 20 miles 
north of boston we are very committed to its history 
through the decades professional staff members here have helped 
thousands of girls from yankees looking for a diversion during 
world war i to the hispanic and cambodian immigrant girls who 
dropped in last week 
its 600 members ranging in age from 6 to 14 visit the white 
clapboard club daily to learn about computers banking science 
cooking and other practical skills they also learn how to avoid 
unwanted pregnancy drug addiction and welfare 
weve built a lot of equity in our name here said sullivan 
she and other officials worry the clubs historic stature will 
be compromised and reliable donors who account for at least half 
the lowell clubs annual 250000 budget will be put off by the 
name change 
people will begin wondering what else has changed sullivan 
said 
other clubs like the nations oldest in stamford conn have 
lodged similar objections 
but bellows said the change was practical and inevitable 
nostalgia had to go by the wayside here in favor of 
survival she said in a telephone interview keeping the 
traditional name was a kind of frivolous luxury we didnt have 
the issue arose two years ago during a girls clubs lawsuit 
against the boys clubs of america inc which had decided to change 
its name to boys and girls clubs of america inc to reflect its 
growing coed membership 
the case was eventually settled out of court when the girls 
clubs agreed to accept 760000 and withdraw its objections 
but girls clubs officials still worried the public would assume 
the two organizations had merged the name change was approved by 
the national body at its annual meeting and made official in may 
the old motto it doesnt matter where a girl comes from as 
long as she knows where she is going also was changed to the 
more sobering growing up is serious business 
girls inc has hired a public relations firm and plans a 
national tv print and radio campaign this summer trumpeting its 
educational programs 
but in lowell sullivan said the clubs reputation needs no 
enhancement 
we are steeped in tradition and dont need a new identity 
said sullivan i have a problem with the assumption that a 
national group knows whats best for this community 
clubs have until 1992 to decide whether to go along with the new 
name slogan and image 
any that decides not to could become a nonvoting affiliate of 
the national organization 
either way the kids dont really care said mary kajanka 
president of the lowell clubs board of trustees all they care 
about is having some place to go and someone to care for them

mcdonnell douglas corp fired more 
than 150 employees who allegedly used interestfree company loans 
intended for personal computers to buy stereos or bigscreen 
televisions or simply for extra cash 
the workers received loans of up to 4000 each under the 
companys loan program but never bought computers company 
spokesman don hanson said friday 
a data processing employee reportedly processed the loans by 
printing phony invoices for computer sales then took a 1000 
kickback loan applicants would then pay back the loan in 
interestfree paycheck deductions 
some workers at the long beach plant used the money to buy 
bigscreen televisions and stereo systems the long beach 
presstelegram reported 
in another scheme employees would buy a 4000 computer submit 
the invoice for a loan then sell the computer back to the retailer 
the reason for the program is to help our people acquire 
equipment that would improve or assure their computer literacy and 
to assure what they got at home would be compatible with what they 
were working on at the plant hanson said 
the program began in 1984 to allow people to shop for the best 
computer bargain and get the loan for the amount of the sale 
hanson said some 5000 employees have taken advantage of the 
program 
hanson said the fraud was discovered in april when an unusually 
large number of applications were received for the maximum amount 
no charges were filed in the case

the youngest son of executed dictator 
nicolae ceausescu insisted saturday he never ordered the army and 
police to shoot at demonstrators during the bloody revolution that 
toppled his father 
nicu ceausescu 39 appearing frail and tense was flanked by 
two helmeted policemen as he testified on the first day of his 
nationally televised trial 
i kept asking the security forces not to shoot at 
demonstrators he said he told the fivejudge military court 
that the evidence did not support the chief charge against him 
complicity in genocide 
key prosecution witnesses were to be called monday when the 
trial resumes 
nicu ceausescu was the regional communist party secretary in 
sibiu 155 miles northwest of bucharest in southern transylvania 
the city was the scene of fierce fighting during decembers 
revolution 
while he steadfastly denied ordering troops to fire on 
demonstrators ceausescu admitted to a lesser charge illegal 
possession of firearms and ammunition 
he also admitted he ordered the destruction of the interior 
ministry archive in sibiu to prevent people from finding a list of 
informers for the securitate the hated secret police 
the trial held in sibius cultural center was expected to last 
several days the building was ringed by half a dozen armored 
personnel carriers and about 40 soldiers in full combat gear 
during the 6hour court session attended by about 200 
spectators ceausescu testified that he had disagreed with his 
parents for at least two decades on economic and political issues 
nicolae and elena ceausescus other two children valentin 43 
a nuclear physicist and zoia elena 37 a mathematician have 
also been in custody awaiting trial but no date has been announced 
the trial provided glimpses of the lifestyle of the younger 
ceausescu who had a reputation as a playboy with a penchant for 
violence 
although he lived in luxury by romanian standards he had a 
mansion with a garden and swimming pool he apparently feared for 
his life he told the court that all his meals were brought by 
plane from bucharest and that he never tasted any food from local 
sources 
press reports after the revolution described the younger 
ceausescu as a hated figure who had committed rapes and had killed 
at least one person while speeding recklessly in his car he was 
also reported to have lost at least 1 million gambling 
for his court appearance saturday nicu wore a saltandpepper 
blazer and an opennecked shirt as well as sunglasses 
his attorney asked if ceausescu could sit during the reading of 
the indictment because he was still recovering from a stab wound 
suffered after his arrest dec 22 near bucharest where he was a 
passenger in a car driven by his cabaretsinger mistress 
nicu needed surgery and six days of hospitalization after the 
attack by an unidentified assailant the court was told 
according to the indictment the younger ceausescus order to 
fire on demonstrators was made in a telephone conference call with 
local party leaders 
from now on we are in a state of war not a state of 
emergency the prosecutor quoted him as saying in the dec 17 
telephone call he said nicu ordered troops to battle stations and 
said you will shoot without warning eightynine people were 
killed in fighting between the revolutionary forces and ceausescus 
security troops in sibiu the indictment said 
more than 20 former police officers and local officials in sibiu 
have been tried and sentenced for genocide and other serious crimes 
in recent months 
ceausescu denied issuing shoottokill orders even at the height 
of the revolution on dec 22 just hours before his parents fled 
bucharest when the army decided to back the revolution 
nicolae and elena ceausescu were arrested convicted of genocide 
at a summary military trial and executed on dec 25 
nicu ceausescu testified that on the morning of dec 22 police 
and leaders of the local securitate told him they were being shot 
at by demonstrators and asked him what to do he said he told them 
to take their secret files but dont shoot at anybody

the looseknit band of radical 
environmentalists known as earth first has gained notoriety for 
such tactics as toppling power lines and billboards and driving 
spikes into trees to destroy logging equipment 
such tactics are the only way to prevent irreversible 
destruction of the environment including the harvesting of 
oldgrowth forests supporters say 
but the radical actions dubbed monkeywrenching for the 
tactics described in the 1975 novel by edward abbey the monkey 
wrench gang have made enemies of loggers utility companies 
ranchers and other targets 
they are a violent terrorist group said john ross 
executive vice president of the california cattlemens association 
two key earth first organizers were arrested friday for 
investigation of transportation and possession of explosives after 
a pipe bomb exploded in their car injuring both bail was set for 
each at 100000 
darryl cherney 33 suffered a facial cut in addition to the 
possession charge he was booked for possession of a destructive 
device in a public place and for possession of a booby trap 
judi bari 40 remained in stable condition at highland hospital 
with a fractured pelvis and internal injuries she was booked on 
all but the booby trap charge 
we suspect they intended to use the device in some way shape 
or form said oakland police lt mike sims 
fbi investigators are looking for a link between the car blast 
and a may 10 pipe bomb that partially exploded in a 
louisianapacific lumber co mill in cloverdale about 80 miles 
north of san francisco causing minimal damage 
but earth first supporters suspect that bari and cherney were 
themselves the targets of a terrorist act accusing both law 
enforcement officials and logging interests of responsibility 
this smacks of fbi tactics that were used against political 
activists like the black panther party and the antiapartheid 
movement in the 60s and 70s said earth first activist karen 
pickett 
baris lawyer susan jordan called the arrests absolutely 
insane 
all their past their present has been devoted to 
nonviolence she said 
in a jail interview with the tribune of oakland cherney said 
that by arresting him the police and the district attorney are 
hiding the fact that they are incapable of going after the wouldbe 
assassin 
this whole thing reeks of an fbi operation he said 
cherney said both he and bari have received numerous death 
threats in recent months as they worked to drum up support for 
redwood summer a threemonth series of nonviolent protests 
planned for this summer 
modeling their plans after the mississippi summer civil 
rights protests of 1964 supporters hope hundreds of protesters 
will flock to northern california forests to participate in 
blockades and sitins against logging 
we fully expected this oppression to come down if we were 
effective cherney said 
friends describe bari and cherney as committed to nonviolence 
and folksinger utah phillips credits bari with helping unite 
loggers and environmentalists on economic reasons to oppose 
clearcutting of oldgrowth forests 
bari also led a recently successful drive to renounce 
treespiking in northern california a labor organizer bari saw 
the controversial practice as an attack on the working class 
phillips said the campaign came after a mill worker was seriously 
injured three years ago while cutting a spiked tree 
earth first was founded in 1979 with the slogan no compromise 
in defense of mother earth 
the group is loosely organized with no officers board of 
directors or formal members supporters refer instead to the 
movement the decentralized structure makes it impossible to 
estimate membership but more than 10000 people subscribe to the 
earth first journal which is published eight times a year 
earth first cofounder david foreman 43 says the group is 
dedicated to defending the earth at all costs in 1985 he wrote 
ecodefense a field guide to monkeywrench which includes 
instructions on how to down power lines and spike trees 
foreman and three others were arrested in may 1989 and later 
indicted on charges of conspiring to sabotage nuclear power and 
arms plants in arizona california and colorado their trial 
originally scheduled for april has been postponed until september 
an anonymous telephone caller who said he represented earth 
first claimed responsibility for attacks on the california 
cattlemens association headquarters in sacramento and a livestock 
auction warehouse in dixon in the same january day in 1989 said 
ross 
in april thousands of people in the santa cruz area were 
without electricity for hours after two utility towers were the 
targets of sabotage believed to be the work of a splinter group of 
earth first called earth night action group according to police 
earth first supporters planned to maintain a 24hour vigil at 
oakland police headquarters until cherney and bari are released 
this only deepens our commitment to nonviolence and i hope 
it does the same for everybody cherney said

in a gubernatorial race that has been 
notably lacking in substantive discussion of the issues democratic 
candidate ann richards drew criticism saturday for doing just that 
in their first joint public appearance richards shared the 
stage with republican nominee clayton williams at a centennial 
celebration for floyd county 
williams speaking to about 800 people in this panhandel county 
seat told a story about buffalo herding more than a century ago in 
west texas and described what a lousy football player he was in 
high school in fort stockton 
ms richards the state treasurer took the stage next and 
spoke about a series of salient issues including education rural 
health and prison overcrowding 
i worked hard on this speech she said i didnt come here 
just to tell you all a bunch of stories 
but county chamber of commerce president kyle smith said ms 
richards reneged on an agreement to avoid making public political 
statements during the old settlers day celebration 
ann richards kind of broke the rules on us he said her 
campaign had made it clear to us her speech wasnt going to be 
political her camp wanted to make sure clayton understood that so 
they would have the same type of speech 
many in the audience however said they had come to hear the 
candidates discuss the issues 
ms richards was en route to another appointment late saturday 
afternoon and could not be reached for comment on whether she had 
broken the rules 
both candidates held news conferences after the ceremony 
at his williams said he had abided by the organizers request 
i came here with the understanding that we were to talk about 
pioneers today he said a press conference is the proper time 
to ask questions above the roar of the crowd 
williams then reiterated that if elected he would push for a 
law requiring parental consent for abortions for minors the 
oilmanrancher said he supports abortion only in cases of rape 
incest or danger to the mothers life 
williams declined to answer questions about other issues saying 
he would do so next week 
at her news conference ms richards reiterated that if 
elected she would push for construction of more prisons 
she also slammed outgoing republican gov bill clements for 
vetoing a 555 million schoolfinance reform package but declined 
to say how she would have acted 
the richards campaign has accused williams of avoiding open 
debate 
before saturdays ceremony williams approached ms richards to 
shake hands and she said im so glad to see you you dont have 
to be afraid of me 
williams had no reply when ms richards added tell your 
consultants to lay back and relax and let you be claytie 
her comment was evocative of williams statement earlier this 
year comparing bad weather to rape he said then if its 
inevitable just relax and enjoy it williams later apologized 
for the remark

the archconservative john birch society on 
saturday denounced the upcoming summit meeting between soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush 
president bush should not be welcoming mikhail gorbachev to 
america should not be helping him out of his severe economic 
difficulties and should not be sweeping 70 years of soviet 
barbarism under a white house rug birch spokesman john f 
mcmanus told a news conference 
mcmanus said gorbahevs glasnost and perestroika initiatives 
were a disguise for continuing the tyranny of earlier soviet 
governments 
he urged bush who begins his meetings with gorbachev on 
thursday at the white house not to sign any new treaties with the 
soviets 
why should we sign agreements with people when we know theyre 
going to break it mcmanus said 
mcmanus also read from a birch society advertisement appearing 
in saturdays editions of the chicago suntimes that calls 
gorbachev an archcriminal desperately seeking western aid to stay 
in power 
he said the ad will appear in newspapers in the minneapolis area 
when gorbachev and his wife raisa visit there june 3 and in the san 
francisco area the next day 
mcmanus whose group is based in appleton wis criticized bush 
for not being more forceful in demanding independence for the 
soviet unions baltic republics 
mcmanus charged that us presidents have aided the spread of 
communism by negotiating with soviet leaders over the years 
if bush wants change in the soviet union he should simply let 
communisim fall under its own weight mcmanus said 
mcmanus refused to talk about whether summits have led the world 
closer to peace or help create a climate in which the berlin wall 
has been dismantled 
i want to answer about the contract of the last 50 years that 
helped build the berlin wall he said 
mcmanus criticized bush and congress for approving economic aid 
for eastern europe contending that poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia are still being run by communist bureaucrats 
we should not be helping these people he said when they 
say democracy they have literally changed nothing

a woman who set fire to the home of the 
lover who spurned her killing his mother wife and 2yearold 
daughter was sentenced to seven consecutive life terms plus 15 
years in prison 
vicky chao 46 remained subdued during sentencing friday by 
superior court judge richard s gebelein and shook her head when 
asked if she wished to make a statement 
you were found guilty of the murders of three people one of 
which was a child the judge told chao before pronouncing 
sentence there is no crime on earth i guess which is as

staterun kabul radio reported 
seven soldiers and four civilians were also killed and 15 
civilians wounded in the attack on khost a besieged town 15 miles 
from the pakistan border said kabul radio monitored in islamabad 
the radio also said extremists fired 22 usmade rockets 
into residental areas of the capital of kabul killing six people 
and wounding 12 the term extremists refers to the 
pakistanbased guerrillas who have been trying for 12 years to

the guerrillas insist they target only military installations 
but admit they sometimes misfire and hit residential areas more 
than 100 rockets hit the capital in the past week killing at least 
12 people 
western diplomats in pakistan said the guerrillas apparently 
stepped up their attacks on kabul to coincide with preparations for

the rebels who are financed by the united states saudi arabia 
and other sympathetic arab states have moved within two miles of 
the town and frequently fire heavy artillery and rockets into the

mexico will seek the arrest and extradition 
of a us narcotics official for his alleged role in abducting a 
mexican doctor charged in the death of an american drug agent the 
mexican attorney generals office said 
the office said it is asking for the extradition of hector 
berrellez a superviser in the us drug enforcement administration 
and allegedly the mastermind of the kidnapping of the doctor 
based on public recognition and testimony in a trial in los 
angeles that the dea paid 20000 for services to kidnap dr 
humberto alvarez machain from mexican territory the attorney 
generals office will ask for the extradition of berrellez it said 
in a news release friday 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty in washington declined to 
comment on the request for extradition 
the mexican doctor faces trial for alleged participation in the 
1985 slaying of dea agent enrique camarena 
berrellez testified friday at a federal hearing in los angeles 
that a payment of up to 50000 was authorized for the capture of 
the doctor he said dea deputy director pete gruden knew of the 
plan 
the abduction of the doctor from his office has caused tension 
between the us and mexican governments mexico has demanded his 
return saying the incident was a violation of mexican sovereignty 
the doctor a guadalajara gynecologist was arrested april 3 
after being taken to el paso texas to face charges he 
administered drugs to camarena during the kidnapping torture and 
murder of the drug agent and his pilot 
in washington dea spokesman frank shults denied that the 
government offered a reward or bounty for the people who captured 
the doctor saying a 20000 payment was provided for services 
he said it could have covered such expenses as rental of the plane 
that flew the prisoner to el paso 
former mexican police officer antonio garate bustamante who is 
wanted by the mexican government testified he paid 20000 in dea 
money to the people who captured the doctor and was continuing to 
pay their expenses 
garate said he arranged for the doctor to be brought across the 
border with the approval of dea officials he said he found friends 
who would do the job without advance payment 
i told them that no money would be provided up front and they 
would have no assistance from the dea he said whatever they 
were doing they were doing on their own 
the attorney generals office said friday that it would present 
formal accusations against berrellez and garate in a mexico city 
district court after obtaining warrants it will present the 
accusations to the foreign ministry to seek the officials 
extradition 
on april 28 the attorney generals office announced the arrest 
of six mexicans for alleged involvement in the doctors capture 
president carlos salinas de gortari commenting on the case 
said friday that the abduction does not help in the fight against 
drug smuggling 
speaking in the northern state of chihuahua salinas said that 
the us and mexican governments should behave with mutual respect 
salinas and other mexican officials have threatened to redefine 
the rules under which mexico cooperates with the united states in 
drug enforcement however officials at the attorney generals 
office have said cooperation continues without any changes 
testimony at the trial of three other men in 1988 showed that 
camarena was interrogated and tortured by drug traffickers 
prosecutors maintain that the abducted doctor gave camarena drugs 
to revive him for additional torture before he was killed 
the drug barons reportedly were angered because camarenas 
undercover work had led us and mexican authorities to a desert 
marijuana plantation where they seized huge quantities of the drug 
worth billions of dollars

cuban exiles challenged visiting soviet officials 
saturday to withdraw economic aid that helps keep fidel castro 
afloat but the soviets rejected the suggestion and reaffirmed 
support for cubas communist government 
we are giving aid not to the cuban government but to the 
cuban people latin american specialist yuri pavlov of the soviet 
foreign ministry said during the rare meeting at a university of 
miami conference 
the statement drew groans from many in the crowd of about 300 
attending the moscowmiami conference at the grand bay hotel in 
coconut grove 
the conference was highlighted by a discussion of ussoviet 
relations by a panel that included georgy arbatov a close adviser 
to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and five other soviets 
us sen wyche fowler dga and us reps dante fascell and 
larry smith both dfla 
the discussion covered a broad range of topics including 
economic cooperation arms reduction and emigration by soviet jews 
but there was one dominant issue for members of miamis cuban 
exile community who attended to plead their case against castro 
no nation is in a better position to influence the cuban 
government said jorge mas canosa an adamant foe of castros 
regime and chairman of the conservative cuban american national 
foundation if the soviets withdraw their subsidy the cuban 
problem would be solved in 48 hours 
but several of the soviet visitors disagreed with mas several 
countered that us trade with cuba would reduce the need for 
soviet economic aid and might lead to reforms 
we have full respect for the views of the cuban communists 
said pavlov we are against an economic blockade of any one 
country 
when the groans and cries of lithuania rang out from the 
back of the room jiri valenta director of the universitys 
institute for soviet and east european studies quickly moved to 
the microphone 
we will conduct this conference in a civilized manner he 
said quieting the audience 
much of the conference was quite civilized with only a small 
group of protesters across the street from the luxury hotel to 
criticize the soviet alliance with castro 
before the recent dramatic changes in eastwest relations the 
appearance of soviet officials in miami would have provoked far 
more anger in the exile community 
in the recent past procommunist entertainers have been banned 
from performing and paintings by procommunist artists have been 
censored in 1984 a city councilman even tried to prevent a visit 
by miss yugoslavia 
but as cuban broadcaster tomas regalado said in an earlier 
interview about the soviet visit this is something that fidel 
will not like the bottom line is if fidel doesnt like it we like 
it 
the soviet delegation included reformminded members of the 
supreme soviet latin american specialists and journalists 
after the twoday conference ends sunday most of the soviets 
plan to fly to washington for the bushgorbachev summit meeting

the robert mapplethorpe photo exhibit ended 
saturday the way it began with a long line waiting to see the 
pictures that prompted an obscenity indictment 
nearly 4000 people lined up saturday at the contemporary arts 
center to see the 175 photos including seven mentioned in the 
indictment before the show closed the line stretched onto the 
street in front of the arcade that houses the art gallery 
the 3902 patrons brought the shows final total to 79893 
easily a record for the arts center a spokesman said 
the exhibit goes next to the boston institute of contemporary 
art where it is to open aug 1 
boston institute director david ross said he expects a quieter 
reaction than in cincinnati 
the perfect moment a display of the late mapplethorpes 
photographs includes seven that a hamilton county grand jury found 
objectionable the arts center and its director dennis barrie are 
under indictment on misdemeanor charges of obscenity and displaying 
children in nudityoriented matter 
five of the photos show homoerotic acts two show naked or 
partly naked children 
the exhibit had a preview showing april 6 for arts center 
members when it opened to the public the next day the grand jury 
was among the spectators 
the case remains unresolved another court appearance is 
scheduled next week 
the controversy only fueled public interest in the exhibit and 
the local dispute became a national cause 
cincinnati has become a microcosm of what is happening all 
over america barrie said in one way its very positive for 
cincinnati i like being able to help shape the future direction of 
national concerns 
mapplethorpes name was first heard outside the art world last 
june when sen jesse helms rnc showed copies of his 
controversial photographs to members of congress 
the corcoran gallery in washington canceled its showing of the 
perfect moment but the exhibit had been shown in six cities 
without incident before it reached cincinnati

began a mail campaign calling for action to prevent this 
pornographic art from being shown in our city the arts center 
its board members and board members employers received hundreds of 
protest letters and calls 
the center voluntarily withdrew from the citys fine arts fund 
on march 25 fearing its inclusion might damage the 1990 fund drive 
the exhibits opening drew further attention when police 
temporarily closed it to videotape the photographs 
the arts community feared the exhibit would be closed to the 
public but us district judge carl rubin issued a temporary 
restraining order april 8 barring law enforcement officials from 
closing the exhibit until the obscenity question was resolved in 
court

kidnappers holding two american hostages 
vowed saturday to make the united states and israel pay the 
price for the massacre of seven palestinian workers in israel 
last week 
however the statement by the organization of islamic jihad for 
the liberation of palestine did not directly threaten to harm the 
two hostages 
in another hostage development saturday plo leader yasser 
arafat reportedly said two swiss red cross workers kidnapped in 
lebanon seven months ago are alive and he offered to help mediate 
their release 
the arabiclanguage statement delivered to a western news 
agency in beirut came with an instant picture of us hostages 
jesse turner and alann steen they were kidnapped jan 24 1987 
from beirut university college 
the picture showed a smiling bespectacled turner wearing a 
bushy black beard and a striped pullover steen wore a dark 
jumpsuit and a beard and his hair was slightly disheveled both 
looked straight at the camera 
the picture resembled a photograph the group released feb 23 
1989 showing turner and steen along with former american hostage 
robert polhill 
however the two photographs were clearly different because 
turners hair was much longer in the later one 
on april 22 the same group released polhill a new yorker and a 
lecturer in accounting who was kidnapped with steen and turner 
turner 42 of boise idaho and steen 50 a native of boston 
were professors serving with the usaffiliated college when they 
were abducted by gunmen posing as lebanese riot police 
eight days after polhill was freed another proiranian group 
the organization of islamic dawn released american hostage frank 
herbert reed 57 of malden mass after 3 years in captivity 
iranian leaders and their lebanese allies have since complained 
the united states has failed to respond with a goodwill gesture of 
its own 
america is directly responsible for shedding the blood of our 
people and their cause the 18line statement said saturday 
referring to the shooting deaths of seven arab laborers in a tel 
aviv suburb on may 20 
israeli officials have said the accused gunman a former 
soldier was apparently deranged the shootings prompted widespread 
unrest among arabs in jordan israel and the occupied territories 
arafat also cited the killings when he urged the un security 
council in geneva on friday to send an international force to 
protect palestinians in the occupied lands 
we warn america and israel that future developments will not 
be in the interest of either of them they will realize that the 
blood will not be wasted they will pay the price the 
kidnappers statement said 
america seeks at all costs to retain its base israel in the 
east and will not permit even verbal resolutions of an adverse 
nature against israel this was seen as a reference to frequent 
us vetoes of un security council resolutions condemning israeli 
actions 
asked about the statement state department spokeswoman anita 
stockman said i dont really have have anything i can comment on 
in terms of the report except to say that our general policy is to 
say that the hostages should be freed immediately and 
unconditionally 
the foreign ministry spokesman in israel refused to comment 
the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine took 
responsibility for the kidnapping of turner steen polhill and 
fellow professor mitheleshwar singh who was released oct 3 1988 
the groups statement saturday condemned the slaying of seven 
palestinian workers as a crime it called the international uproar 
over the killings artificial patronage and a hollow storm of 
empty words and said the effective deterrent is force 
turner and steen are among 16 western hostages held in lebanon 
most of them by proiranian shiite moslem zealots the captives are 
six americans four britons two west germans two swiss an 
italian and an irishman 
after the un security council session in geneva on friday 
arafat discussed the two swiss hostages with pierreyves simonin a 
ranking swiss foreign ministry official a department spokeswoman 
said saturday 
but the plo chief did not say where emanuel christen and elio 
erriquez of the allswiss international committee of the red cross 
were being held or by whom the spokeswoman andrea reichlin also 
said arafat offered to mediate between the kidnappers and swiss 
authorities if such contacts come about 
in a meeting with cornelio sommaruga president of the 
genevabased icrc arafat repeated his assurance that the two 
hostages are alive she said 
erriquez and christen were taken captive oct 6 in the southern 
lebanese port city of sidon where they helped run an artificial 
limb center for victims of civil war no one claimed responsibility 
for the kidnapping 
however the men are believed held by the fatahrevolutionary 
council the group headed by terrorist mastermind abu nidal who 
broke with arafat years ago palestinian sources linked the 
abduction to a lebanese moslem shiite hussein hariri jailed for 
life in switzerland in february 1989 for hijacking an air afrique 
jetliner two years earlier and killing a french passenger 
of the 16 western hostages the longestheld is us journalist

the bloodiest election campaign in 
colombias 180 years of independence comes to a close with sundays 
presidential voting but many feared that the terror unleashed by 
drug traffickers would continue 
officials accused the drug barons of using violence to keep 
people away from the polls the army and police mobilized 230000 
troops for electionday duty and military checkpoints lined major 
streets and highways 
just hours before the polls were to open president virgilio 
barco exhorted colombians to vote in defiance of the terrorism 
to vote is to support democracy to reject violence and to 
defend the rights that the terrorists want to snatch from us 
barco said in his nationally broadcast speech 
he added i do not have the slightest doubt that both the 
terrorist acts aimed at taking the lives of presidential candidates 
as well as those committed against other compatriots have been 
carried out to intimidate the popular will 
some colombians said they planned to vote early to cut the 
time spent standing in line thus reducing the risk of being killed 
or maimed in an attack 
colombias drug war has overshadowed every other issue in the 
presidential campaign 
in the past nine months three presidential candidates 262 
policemen 93 soldiers three judges 15 news media employees and 
about 1700 other people have been slain 
bombs have exploded at schools churches shopping centers and 
supermarkets one bomb destroyed a colombian airliner killing all 
107 people aboard 
in the two weeks leading up to sundays balloting nine bombs 
exploded in four colombian cities killing 37 people and wounding 
more than 320 
few of the crimes have been solved but suspicion for most of 
the killings has fallen on drug traffickers who have private 
armies and billions of dollars in cocaine profits at their disposal 
rightwing death squads and leftist guerrillas also have played 
roles in the carnage 
the army and police said 230000 troops would be out in force 
for the election and a curfew was imposed in the drug capital of 
medellin following a wave of bombings and murders 
government officials have expressed fears that intimidation by 
traffickers would prevent some people from voting and accused the 
drug lords of stepping up attacks to scare people there are about 
138 million eligible voters 
barco and his wife planned to vote as soon as the polls opened 
as is traditional for the president barcos fouryear term ends 
aug 7 and the constitution prohibits a president from serving two 
successive terms 
there are 12 candidates for president only four are considered 
to have nationwide backing 
the ruling liberal partys candidate cesar gaviria is 
considered the leading contender he is the only candidate who has 
promised to continue barcos tough policies against the 
traffickers including extradition of drug traffickers to the 
united states 
gaviria replaced the partys frontrunning presidential 
contender luis carlos galan who was assassinated last aug 18 
it was the killing of galan which authorities blamed on 
traffickers that set off the governments offensive against the 
drug trade including the resumption of the governments 
extradition policy 
one main presidential contender alvaro gomez has urged 
legalization of cocaine in the major drugconsuming countries he 
says the only way to put the traffickers out of business is to 
deprive them of profits 
gomez an independent and the other two main candidates 
rodrigo lloreda and navarro wolf all say they would likely stop 
the extraditions the barco government has extradited 15 drug 
suspects to the united states in the past nine months 
gaviria says he would continue extraditions at least until 
colombia is able to put traffickers in jail and keep them there 
no other issue claimed anything approaching the attention given 
to the drug war 
the traffickers dark shadow of terrorism has blotted out all 
other issues said enrique santos whose family owns the bogota 
daily el tiempo colombias largest newspaper there is nothing 
philosophical about this election 
indeed the candidates have scarcely mentioned such pressing 
issues as unemployment inflation and the need for land reform 
unemployment is running 9 percent according to government 
figures private economists say it is 20 percent inflation is 
running at 28 percent up from 26 percent last year 
clara lopez a former bogota city council president says 
drugrelated violence poses less of a threat than social injustice 
which she says could lead to unrest 
all of colombias problems originate with the inequitable 
distribution of land said lopez a human rights activist who has 
campaigned for constitutional reforms 
colombians also decide sunday whether a constituent assembly 
should be named to consider changes in the 1886 constitution 
proponents of the assembly say the constitution must be altered to 
make the judicial system stronger and to break up large land 
holdings 
according to a 1970 census the last that tracked land 
distribution ownership of 68 percent of the land is concentrated 
in the hands of 43 percent of the population 
but even that problem goes back to drug traffickers the army 
has said traffickers own millions of acres of land 
gaviria and other presidential candidates following barcos 
lead have insisted that the root of the problem lies with the 
insatiable appetite for cocaine in other countries especially in 
the united states

the rev desmond tutu said he was more 
surprised by the recent changes in south africa than the fact that 
tens of thousands of proapartheid demonstrators turned out in 
pretoria on saturday to protest them 
theyve been supporting apartheid for so long tutu south 
africas anglican archbishop told a news conference what is 
surprising is that we should see a government that is willing to 
risk that 
since coming to power last year south african president fw de 
klerk has freed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
from prison promised apartheid would end within five years and 
taken other measures to end discriminatory policies 
tutu said its not surprising that whites who enjoyed privileges 
under apartheid would object to losing some of them 
the surprising thing is that the government should in fact 
have broken loose from that kind of thinking he said 
tens of thousands of whites shouted their support for white 
minority rule and condemned de klerk at the rally saturday in 
pretoria 
tutu in cincinnati for a fourday visit said if he had been 
able to address the demonstrators he would have told them they 
cannot prevail 
id say to them you do have the right to hold that rally 
but ultimately it is selfdefeating he said what in fact are 
you seeking to do you are seeking to carve out for yourself a 
separate freedom now the world has discovered that freedom is 
indivisible 
theres a spirit that cannot be quenched he said referring 
to recent changes in for example eastern europe a repressive 
government an unjust system are based on a foundation that is 
fundamentally unstable 
tutu is spending the weekend meeting with religious leaders and 
representatives of the black community and making numerous public 
appearances 
the cleric on a sixcity trip through the united states said 
hes enjoying the chance to visit a country with freedom and 
opportunities 
you do get a sense of how wonderful it is despite all of the 
awful messes that are happening at how wonderful it is in fact to 
live in a free country he said lets say a country that seeks 
to be ever more free 
tutu said he dreams of a day when diversity will be cherished in 
his country and liberties will be guaranteed 
what we dream about is a country that will have a bill of 
rights that guarantees individual rights he said and then i 
hope that we would be absolutely libertarian totally libertarian

boudreaux who accused the district attorneys office of yielding 
to public pressure to bring charges

tens of thousands of flagwaving 
whites staged the largest proapartheid rally since president fw 
de klerk came to power last year and cheered a pledge by rightwing 
leaders to defend white power 
andries treurnicht leader of the main opposition conservative 
party said whites would resist any effort to impose a black 
majority government and called for early elections to oust de klerk 
about 50000 whites including many women and children attended 
the rally under deep blue skies at the voortrekker monument a 
shrine to afrikaner nationalism organizers claimed 150000 people 
attended 
stay white and the struggle for a free state has begun 
said some of the posters carried by protesters 
the socalled new south africa of forced integration which 
the government is forcing on us gives us no other choice but to 
defend our rights treurnicht said as the huge throng cheered and 
clapped 
we shall not accept the threatened destruction of our nations 
freedom but will fight to restore that which has already been 
unjustly given away he said 
treurnicht denounced nelson mandela and his african national 
congress as communists and terrorists he claimed black 
nationalists would impose communist dictatorship if they gained 
power 
the anc hates the boer people and the white nation they 
demand our land they reject our right to exist he said as the 
crowd screamed its approval 
mandela addressed a rally in the nearby black township of 
atteridgeville where he told about 40000 cheering blacks that the 
right wing could not preserve white rule 
today at this moment in fact andries treurnicht that 
prophet of doom is meeting over that hill in order to oppose 
the effort made by the anc and the government to bring peace into 
this country mandela said we say to treurnicht we have 
defeated greater men than himself 
he will be defeated 
in cincinnati archbishop desmond tutu said if he had a chance 
to address the white demonstrators he would have told them that 
freedom will prevail 
id say to them you do have the right to hold that rally but 
ultimately it is selfdefeating he said what in fact are you 
seeking to do you are seeking to carve out for yourself a separate 
freedom 
the world has discovered that freedom is indivisible said 
tutu south africas anglican archbishop and nobel peace laureate 
treurnichts rally marked the launch of the right wings third 
freedom struggle a reference to two 19th century wars against 
britain treurnicht presented a freedom manifesto that called for 
nationwide struggle for a white state 
he denounced de klerk for moving to end whiteminority rule and 
share power with the black majority de klerk who came to power 
last august legalized the anc and released mandela in february 
after 27 years in prison but he has stopped short of supporting 
black majority rule 
treurnicht who received a thunderous ovation from the crowd as 
he arrived in a horsedrawn carriage was escorted by about 200 
horsemen in a commando or afrikaner war party 
the crowd waved hundreds of blue red white and green flags of 
the old transvaal republic which was defeated by britain in the 
boer war afrikaners whites of mainly dutch descent dominate 
south african politics 
scores of uniformed and armed members of ultraright groups 
attended the rally and some carried signs with slogans such as 
hang mandela 
of course im a racist the blacks are racist i know im 
better than blacks said one rightwinger who would not give his 
name 
in johannesburg de klerk predicted substantial changes in south 
africas relations with the rest of the world he returned saturday 
from 18 days of explaining his reform policies in europe 
i can report back to you today that substantial change in the 
relations of europe with south africa will come and i believe 
through europe the international community will follow he told 
about 1000 cheering supporters at jan smuts airport 
the government cannot be forced to call elections until 1994 and 
de klerk is confident he can carry out reforms and gain acceptance 
in that time 
treurnicht said little that was new and was vague on what the 
conservatives would do if the government refuses to hold elections 
he said his party would follow legal means of opposition 
as long as there is a constitutional path open whereby we can 
regain political control we will use that strategy to win a 
victory at the polling booth he said 
but treurnicht did make veiled references to a white backlash if 
de klerk ends white minority rule do not force our people to 
stand in your path and to challenge you to walk over us there 
is no boat waiting for us in the harbor he said 
the government contends the right wing cannot stop the reforms 
begun by de klerk but officials admit privately that many whites 
are flocking to the conservatives because of their opposition to 
ending white rule

chinas political repression hasnt altered the shift schedule 
for workers making barbie doll accessories near canton mcdonnell 
douglas jetliners outside shanghai or jeep cherokees in beijing 
but for other american businesses ranging from defense 
contractor grumman corp to tourism outfits like lindblad travel 
the consequences of the yearold crackdown on dissent have been 
disappointing or worse 
their experiences show the mixed impact of the crushed tiananmen 
uprising on the hundreds of us companies and investors that have 
sought a foothold in the worlds most populous nation since it 
emerged from isolation a decade ago 
china has always been difficult to generalize about its a 
huge place said jerome alan cohen a china specialist in the 
hong kong office of the international law firm paul weiss rifkind 
wharton amp garrison 
trade continues to go up investment is plainly down said 
cohen whose firm advises american and other foreign clients you 
have fewer new projects coming into the pipeline the results are 
only gradually becoming apparent 
other uschina specialists and business executives generally 
agree the combination of a political chill and a severe economic 
decline have made the country a more difficult place for foreign 
companies the past year 
many pending deals have stalled or unraveled new investment has 
tumbled and the longterm outlook for improvement remains unclear 
american visitors have slowed to a trickle 
uschinese commercial relations warmed somewhat on may 24 
when president bush extended chinas mostfavorednation trading 
status for a year 
the move aimed at protecting 18 billion in twoway trade was 
welcomed by us farmers toymakers and textile importers who stood 
to suffer had bush done otherwise 
american business attitudes toward china have hardened 
nevertheless any illusions that american entrepreneurs may have 
harbored about the potential of this market of a billion consumers 
were shattered by last junes violence 
no one is saying hey china theres something we havent 
looked at yet said richard brecher manager of the investor 
advisory program for the united stateschina business council a 
washingtonbased group that promotes american business interests in 
china 
at the same time brecher said i think theres a sense among 
most of the business community that were dealing with a 
transitional government its a matter of holding on now 
weathering the storm 
no us company operating in china before june has departed 
many say that after a shortlived disruption a year ago their 
operations there are normal or close to it 
at mattels two factories in southern guangdong province for 
example output of barbie accessories disney items and preschool 
products accounts for about 20 percent of the toy giants business 
spokesman glenn bozarth said 
although the company could have switched production to other 
factories in malaysia mexico or europe under an emergency 
contingency plan last june he said we didnt invoke that 
because there wasnt a need 
at mcdonnell douglas corps operation near shanghai where 
chinese workers assemble md80 jetliners the production schedule 
recently was extended by 20 aircraft the operation one of chinas 
largest manufacturing ventures with a us company began in 1985 
with a longterm contract to assemble 25 md80s 
the fact is china has a very large requirement for 
airplanes said donald hanson spokesman for the companys 
douglas aircraft subsidiary as for the political mood in the 
country i dont think i can say its had any major impact he 
said 
but some other highprofile ventures have slowed down chrysler 
corp has been forced to scale back the production schedule at its 
jeep assembly plant in the chinese capital largely because of 
chinas economic austerity controls spokeswoman karen stewart said 
we havent gone backwards but havent gone forward as much as 
we would have liked she said with china our policy is were 
there to stay for the long haul you reach ebbs and flows 
grumman corp suffered when china scrapped a 2568 million 
contract to modernize chinese jet fighters with equipment built by 
the defense contractor 
the midmay cancellation was an indirect result of the bush 
administrations suspension of military sales to the country last 
year still said company spokesman weyman b jones grumman 
remains a partner in a joint venture near shanghai that plans to 
produce 500 fire trucks a year 
last year us companies signed 268 contracts for joint 
ventures and other projects 43 more than a year earlier but 
practically all 1989 contracts were completed before june and new 
ventures definitely have stalled 
between june and december clearly there was a downturn 
said charles j conroy a partner at baker amp mckenzie a law firm 
that represents many businesses with interests in china 
conroy said some american companies have since begun to quietly 
explore new opportunities in china but he said theyre not 
megabilliondollar investments like new airports or port 
infrastructure 
perhaps the biggest us business victims of the past year have 
been tour operators most were overwhelmed by cancellations last 
summer their busiest time of year and face another dismal summer 
this year 
united airlines and northwest airlines the two us carriers to 
china have both cut flights to one a week because of slack demand 
the reason why people arent going is not because theyre 
afraid its moral indignation about what happened there said 
lars eric lindblad whose lindblad travel company pioneered 
largescale us tours to china but folded in october partly the 
result of mass cancellations 
lindblad nevertheless plans to lead a 484passenger ocean cruise 
lines tour to china on june 21 the first big us vacation group 
to visit the country since the tiananmen uprising he said the tour 
is fully booked 
other tour operators said theyve picked up some china business 
mostly for the fall many expect tourism to resume in earnest 
eventually but most are still smarting from the wallop they 
received a year ago 
the group business just dropped everyone canceled said 
patricia cunneen head of eastquest a small new yorkbased travel 
concern that specializes in adventurous trips to asia 
although her company survived she said a lot of businesses 
have closed they call it the tiananmen massacre here

when mikhail bernstam taught economics in 
leningrad 20 years ago and expressed some distinctly nonmarxist 
ideas his colleagues gave him puzzled worried looks 
my friends barely understood me they thought i was crazy 
says bernstam now a senior fellow at the hoover institution on the 
stanford university campus 
soviet president mikhail gorbachevs postsummit visit monday to 
hoover a longtime bastion of anticommunism will give bernstam 
the chance finally to offer his crazy notions to a more 
receptive countryman 
bernstam and five other scholars at hoover the think tank that 
spawned the economic principles and some key figures in the reagan 
and bush administrations will offer papers to gorbachev 
suggesting ways of solving the soviet unions enormous economic 
problems 
if gorbachev is coming to stanford for advice and san francisco 
for business hell find plenty of people eager to accommodate him 
though more than a few are skeptical of the success of his reform 
program 
the academic and corporate communities playing host to gorbachev 
expect him to make a strong pitch for support in converting the 
soviet economy to a freemarket system 
the visit has charged the bay area with a super bowl atmosphere

their ideas and willingness to join with soviet officials to 
reshape the country 
the onepage summaries offered to gorbachev who was lured to 
hoover by former secretary of state george shultz are written in 
russian and will be followed by longer papers for his aides 
we dont want to be so presumptive to suggest that we want to 
tell him how to run his country said hoover director john 
raisian but we want to be cooperative and be prepared to have an 
offer of assistance ready if we were welcomed to have one

a baltic cloud hangs over the ussoviet 
summit as pressure builds on lithuania to suspend its declaration 
of independence and return at least temporarily to the soviet 
fold 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush both 
hopeful of making progress on arms control and other issues may 
find the baltics a needling irritant when they begin a fourday 
summit thursday 
but gorbachev may be moving to disperse what bush calls a 
cloud of tension over the three baltic republics proclamations 
of independence 
if gorbachev succeeds the summit forecast could be much sunnier 
late last week gorbachev said that if lithuania suspended its 
march 11 declaration he would lift his punishing economic embargo 
and even compensate lithuanians for its damage 
the soviet president also offered a road map for lithuanian 
independence saying it could be achieved under kremlin rules 
within two years three years earlier than he had said previously 
in a meeting with lithuanian lawmakers in moscow gorbachev did 
not repeat his previous insistence that independence be sought only 
under the terms of a soviet secession law 
that law which baltic leaders dub the law to prevent 
secession permits independence only after a fiveyear 
coolingoff period 
but gorbachev paired last weeks carrot with a heavy stick 
vowing to impose direct presidential rule on lithuania if the 
independence declaration was not suspended 
if he imposed presidential rule gorbachev could disband 
lithuanias parliament its first freely elected legislature in 50 
years replace the lithuanian government with moscowappointed 
officials and impose martial law 
the lithuanian parliament has so far offered only to suspend the 
effect of laws to implement independence and has adamantly refused 
to freeze the independence declaration itself 
balticamericans will use the summit to dramatize the cause of 
lithuania latvia and estonia all of which lost their independence 
in a 1940 secret deal between josef stalin and adolf hitler 
a rally is planned in lafayette park across from the white house 
before gorbachevs arrival one lithuanian group will demonstrate 
outside the soviet embassy another will conduct a candlelight 
vigil there two mass demonstrations are planned on the steps of 
the capitol 
bush acknowledged last week that the independence crisis 
certainly puts some tension on the summit and said he was 
unhappy about the state of play in the baltics 
but bush has also said repeatedly that his discussions with 
gorbachev on nuclear arms control are too important to be derailed 
secretary of state james a baker iii said recently the 
independence crisis does cast a long shadow but he says the 
administration is determined to prevent the summits eclipse 
there is too much at stake to dismiss cavalierly the 
potential for progress in ussoviet relations baker said 
the euphoria that flared from baltic expatriots worldwide when 
lithuania issued its ringing declaration of independence evaporated 
in the warning rumble of soviet tanks through the streets of 
vilnius and in gorbachevs orders to slow to a trickle the flow of 
oil and natural gas into the republic 
but the soviet economic embargo did not discourage the thirst 
for independence there or in neighboring latvia and estonia 
the estonian parliament on march 30 branded the soviet union an 
occupying power and vowed to restore full independence over time 
on may 4 the latvian parliament followed suit declaring 
independence while trying to avoid an outright clash with moscow by 
postponing the effective date pending completion of negotiations 
baltic leaders have contended that agreeing to gorbachevs 
original demand that they seek independence under soviet law would 
be to concede their incorporation into the soviet union was legal 
in the first place 
admitting that we must quit the soviet union under soviet law 
would be to lose our most important asset our status as an 
occupied country said tunne v kelam chairman of the council of 
estonia the executive committee of estonias independent 
parliament 
when you are raped and robbed you cannot ask for legal 
divorce you were never married kelam said in an interview 
during a recent us visit 
the three baltic republics have long been known in conservative 
circles in the united states as the captive nations outside 
the balticamerican community the most intense domestic pressure 
on bush to embrace the independence cause has come from this 
direction 
bush and baker have voiced a doubleedged policy toward the 
baltics 
over 50 years the united states has never recognized the 
forced incorporation of the three republics into the soviet union 
it does not do so now 
but the united states will not extend formal diplomatic 
recognition until those republics control their own territory 
institutions and political destiny 
with a highstakes agenda before him bush decided not to impose 
sanctions against the soviets to make gorbachev pay a price for his 
embargo against lithuania 
upset by that decision the senate on may 2 voted 7324 to put 
bush on notice that congressional approval of a new ussoviet 
trade agreement prized by moscow is unlikely until the embargo is 
lifted and talks begin on lithuanian independence 
kazimiera prunskiene an economist and lithuanias elected prime 
minister said repeatedly during a us visit last month that the 
west held the key to independence 
her prescription increase economic and political pressure on 
gorbachev to free the baltic republics while at the same time 
encouraging the democratic reforms fostered by gorbachevs glasnost 
openness and perestroika economic restructuring 
a democratized soviet union she reasons will not cling to 
formerly independent nations annexed against their peoples will 
dmitri simes an exiled soviet scholar who is a senior associate 
of the carnegie endowment for international peace contends the 
real choice gorbachev faces is not between perestroika and 
lithuanian independence but between building soviet democracy and 
saving the vast and rickety soviet domain 
but many western leaders fault lithuania for moving too rapidly 
for giving fuel to gorbachevs conservative opposition 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois 
mitterrand have urged lithuania to suspend its declaration of 
independence and follow the dictates of the soviet independence law 
the bush administration has all but endorsed this approach 
nudging the baltic republics to accept it 
gorbachev told baker in moscow earlier in the month that 
domestic pressures are such that he does not have a lot of room 
to maneuver on the baltic crisis 
there the stalemate stands 
vytautas landsbergis the president of the lithuanian 
parliament urged his countrymen last week to hold on and to 
survive as though we were in a surrounded fortress 
meanwhile he and the leaders of latvia and estonia have 
appealed to bush and gorbachev to take our problems into their 
hearts as they view the world from the summits heights

this summers movie season is so competitive 
that film studios have been juggling release dates as if they were 
auditioning for the circus 
with madonna as a costar and cameos by such stars as dustin 
hoffman and james caan dick tracy is the most hyped summer 
extravaganza but its going up against such probable hits as 
total recall the sciencefiction adventure starring arnold 
schwarzenegger one of the movie industrys biggest boxoffice 
draws and back to the future iii the last in the michael j 
fox trilogy 
there are other eagerly anticipated summer movies as well 
another 48 hrs sequel to the eddie murphynick nolte cop 
caper tom cruises car racing movie days of thunder and 
die hard 2 a sequel to the bruce willis thriller 
total recall directed by paul verhoeven whose most recent 
smash was 1987s futuristic thriller robocop was once set to 
open against dick tracy on june 15 now it will debut june 1 
back to the future iii opened friday to good reviews 
dick tracy starring and directed by warren beatty will see 
whether audiences staggered by last summers batman are ready 
for another film inspired by a comic book it also remains to be 
seen if beatty who has made only two movies in nine years is a 
boxoffice draw the walt disney cos fortunes for the season are 
riding on dick tracy as well as the scifi arachnophobia 
ducktales the movie and the reissue of the classic jungle 
book 
the adventures of ford fairlane standup comic andrew dice 
clays portrayal of a rock n roll detective originally slotted 
for a may and then a june premiere wont arrive until july 
paramount pictures moved another 48 hrs from june 27 to june 
8 switching places with the studios delayed days of thunder 
studio distribution executives worry 23000 domestic screens 
arent enough for all this summers titles which include about 40 
major releases and some wonder whether all the commotion is really 
worth it 
it is not a good thing to rush films to the screen said 
robert zemeckis the director of back to the future part iii 
which had been set to open friday by universal pictures for more 
than a year 
universal considers the memorial day weekend traditionally a 
heavy moviegoing weekend to be one of the best spots to launch a 
film with this much anticipation 
summer moviegoers have a tremendous choice from the mel 
gibsongoldie hawn romantic adventurecomedy bird on a wire 
which opened may 18 to good box office but mixed reviews to david 
lynchs wild at heart opening aug 24 which won the top prize 
at the recent cannes film festival 
i think its going to be a little wilder and a little woolier 
this summer said sid ganis president of paramounts motion 
picture group there are lots of big good summer films opening 
this year 
while most of the seasons movies probably wont send critics 
scurrying for superlatives the bumper crop is among the costliest 
ever total recall cost a reported 60 million die hard 2 
with willis trying to rescue his wife in an airport reportedly 
burned up just a few dollars less 
days of thunder dubbed by some top car because it seems 
to resemble top gun has raced through 50 million 
with so much money being thrown at the screen in so few weeks 
its certain that several highticket movies will unspool to mostly 
empty houses will the busts include robocop 2 gremlins 2 
the new batch flight of the intruder or fire birds 
which opened friday to poor reviews or will these take off 
leaving other efforts in their wake 
if there are any sure bets this summer and there arent many 
according to studio insiders they include days of thunder 
another 48 hrs die hard 2 total recall and back to 
the future part iii 
a lot of prognosticators are keen on beattys dick tracy 
but others arent convinced the 53yearold ishtar veteran 
still has the directorial talent he showed in reds or the 
appeal he had years ago in bonnie and clyde and shampoo 
according to an informal poll of studio executives possible 
summer sleepers include presumed innocent ghost problem 
child and arachnophobia 
disney which has appended the new roger rabbit short roller 
coaster rabbit to dick tracy hopes audiences will be 
attracted to the studios sequelfree lineup 
we dont have any roman numerals after any of our pictures 
said dick cook president of disneys buena vista pictures 
distribution 
to promote the adventures of ford fairlane 20th century fox 
will run trailers for the film with die hard 2 which opens 
july 4 
the strategy said tom sherak president of domestic marketing 
and distribution for fox is to make clay a more familiar face in 
middle america as the studios come up with better and better 
films the pressure on the marketing and distribution people has 
never been greater sherak said 
si kornblitt universals executive vice president of worldwide 
marketing said opening bill cosbys ghost dad opposite days 
of thunder might not be as masochistic as it looks it takes 
guts to go against tom cruise but we think weve got the picture 
to do it he said 
ghost dad directed by sidney poitier stars cosby as a 
corporate father who spends more time in the office than at home 
he drowns and then spends a few days looking for his body while 
putting together a merger and visiting his children 
taking a cue from disneys move last summer of pitting honey 
i shrunk the kids against batman universal hopes the family 
theme of ghost dad will appeal to audiences not so keen on car 
racing or schwarzeneggers muscles 
the actionadventure glut may benefit samuel goldwyn co whose 
wild at heart might offer relief to audiences shellshocked 
from a summer of exploding bodies and car chases 
there is an appetite driven by robocop gremlins and 48 
hrs for a distinctive offering a film that is neither a sequel 
nor a generic copy said tom rothman goldwyns head of worldwide 
production he said just as tv viewers tuned into david lynchs 
twin peaks because they were weary of network drivel movie 
patrons should flock to lynchs offbeat look at two young lovers on 
the road 
last summer was the richest in hollywood history with more than 
204 billion worth of tickets sold from memorial day through labor 
day the 1989 summer was exceptional because in an era of 6 
tickets admissions were up to more than 456 million an increase 
of 40 million tickets from the previous summer 
five of last summers films batman indiana jones and 
the last crusade lethal weapon 2 honey i shrunk the 
kids and ghostbusters ii made more than 100 million 
apiece with batman becoming the fifth most popular film in 
movie history 
this summer could top last years 
we think this summer on paper looks like its going to be 
huge said greg rutkowski vice president of west operations for 
amc theatres the nations secondlargest theater chain 
the feeling in our company is its going to be every bit as 
big as last summer and we dont think business will be limited to 
four or five films as it was last summer

the first time raisa gorbachev met barbara 
bush the two were sharing a limousine during the rush of events 
that surrounded the 1987 washington summit between president reagan 
and raisas husband mikhail 
mrs gorbachev apparently had been briefed that the wife of the 
thenvice president was a whitehaired grandmotherly homemaker 
oh barbara i have to share with you a wonderful recipe for 
blueberry pie mrs gorbachev a doctor of philosophy told her 
hostess the best known dropout from the smith college class of 47 
the soviet visitor described a rudimentary recipe that sounded 
as if it came from a script barbara bush listened then asked 
skeptically raisa do you cook at home 
well yes sometimes i do replied mrs gorbachev 
well i never cook at home so lets talk about something 
else said mrs bush and the two women proceeded to converse in 
a more relaxed and less stilted fashion 
the anecdote which mrs bush herself enjoys telling makes two 
points 
raisa gorbachev ever the marxist lecturer tries to do her 
homework before she comes to a summit 
barbara bush is never at a loss for words and no one however 
high or mighty is immune from her wit 
the two first ladies will share the spotlight with their 
husbands thursday when bush welcomes gorbachev to the white house 
the wives will repair to the private residence for tea while their 
husbands talk in the oval office that evening the bushes will 
play host to the gorbachevs at a blacktie dinner 
friday the first ladies will fly to wellesley college in 
massachusetts where both will address the schools commencement 
that night the gorbachevs will be hosts for the bushes for dinner 
at the soviet embassy 
saturday the women probably will accompany their husbands to 
camp david the presidential retreat in the maryland mountains 75 
miles away sunday the gorbachevs will fly to minneapolis where 
she will visit with a middleclass family and then to california 
sharing the wellesley podium was mrs bushs idea she tendered 
the invitation long before 150 seniors signed a petition 
questioning her selection as commencement speaker 
the seniors challenged the wisdom of honoring a woman who has 
gained recognition through the achievements of her husband 
prominent feminists responded that they had no quarrel with the 
way mrs bush chose to lead her life mrs bush herself called it 
no big deal even i was 20 once 
barbara bush 64 is a publishers daughter from rye ny who 
dropped out of college in 1944 to marry her teenage sweetheart 
george a navy pilot and war hero she followed him to yale and 
then texas for a life in the oil fields 
apart from a wartime summer job in a bolt factory and a 
parttime stint at the yale coop mrs bush devoted herself to 
home and family raising five children a sixth daughter robin 
died of leukemia when she was 3 years old and holding the family 
together through 29 moves in her husbands peripatetic career in 
business politics and diplomacy 
a lifelong volunteer she adopted literacy as her personal cause 
when bush became vice president in 1981 since he was elected 
president 16 months ago she has spoken out on the plight of aids 
victims but has avoided delivering her views in public on abortion 
and other controversial issues 
her downtoearth ways her obvious love of family her 
fullsize figure and her white hair have all endeared her to 
americans across the political spectrum 
raisa gorbachev 58 is the siberianborn daughter of a railway 
worker she attended the soviet unions top academic institution 
moscow state university where she met her future husband a law 
student who lived in the same hostel 
while her husband rose through the party ranks she taught 
school and wrote a pioneering sociologylike dissertation on life 
in rural stavropols collective farms the gorbachevs are known to 
have a daughter who is a physician and are believed to also have 
a son 
when gorbachev became the communist partys agriculture 
secretary in 1978 she joined the philosophy faculty at moscow 
state she stepped down when her husband became the partys general 
secretary in 1985 
strongwilled and stylish the british press once dubbed her 
soviet realisms answer to princess diana she has been in the 
public eye far more than the wives of past soviet leaders while 
the coverage of her foreign trips has been far less extensive at 
home than abroad her penchant for finer living has aroused some 
enmity one of her husbands bestknown opponents maverick boris 
yeltsin even criticized her in a 1987 speech to party leaders 
soon thereafter yeltsin was stripped of his party office 
however mrs bush and mrs gorbachev get along their relations 
will likely be better than those between nancy reagan and the 
soviet first lady 
the nancyraisa feud was played out in soap opera fashion at 
summits whenever they met and once when they didnt mrs 
gorbachev showed up unexpectedly in reykjavik iceland for the 
hurriedly called 1986 summit while mrs reagan who had been told 
her counterpart would not come stayed home 
on her 1987 visit to washington mrs gorbachev kept the reagan 
white house guessing about her schedule mrs reagan had trouble 
pinning her down for a white house tour and when she did come she 
described the presidential mansion as more of a museum of 
american history than a regular house 
in moscow during the june 1988 summit mrs reagan described her 
testy relationship with mrs gorbachev as a mexican standoff 
in her 1989 memoirs my turn mrs reagan wrote my 
fundamental impression of raisa gorbachev was that she never 
stopped talking or lecturing to be more accurate 
as part of the gorbachevs tour of the united states he is said 
to be trying to set up a breakfast meeting with reagan in san 
francisco whether mrs reagan and mrs gorbachev would join their 
husbands isnt known

never let it be said that the swine 
industry lacks a sense of showmanship 
the 1990 world pork expo will boast a squeal of fortune 
game a pigcasso art show pig races and exhibitions of 
chinese swine with skin more crumpled than a commuters suit on a 
steamy day 
the show opens saturday at the iowa state fairgrounds and is 
expected to attract more than 100000 visitors including 
representatives from about 60 countries before it winds down on 
june 4 
those forking over the 5aperson admission fee also will have 
a chance to pig out on more than 13 tons of pork to be dished out 
at the big grill a barbecue pit thats almost as long as a 
football field where about 200 volunteers will use pitchforks to 
tend to the ham ribs and pork loins 
organizers hope to set a record for the worlds largest pork 
barbecue breaking the 12ton mark set at last years expo 
this years festivities come as hog farmers deal with concerns 
that such issues as food safety and animal rights could endanger 
their recently strong business 
pork prices are at heights last seen nearly eight years ago and 
profits have been steadily rising this year according to dan 
obrien an economist at iowa state university who specializes in 
livestock markets 
the universitys monthly survey of livestock operation profits 
says the most common hog farm in iowa earned a profit of nearly 30 
a head in april compared with 1256 a head in january 
the mood of the industry has to be excited says mike 
wehler who raises hogs near plain wis and is president of the 
national pork producers council the nations leading pork trade 
group we could very well be headed for an alltime record year 
in terms of prices 
with things going so well the industry is wary of anything that 
could reverse the trend 
from the producers standpoint deterioration of the market is 
the no 1 fear wehler says 
two primary concerns are food safety and animal rights not only 
are consumers asking more and more questions about the chemicals in 
their food but they also are organizing boycotts 
memories of last years alar uproar that hurt apple sales and 
halted use of the chemical are fresh in the minds of farmers the 
pork industry has its own memories of the nitrite scare that 
plagued bacon sales a decade ago 
weve all seen what can happen with demand for a product 
wehler says 
in an attempt to avoid becoming a target again the pork council 
has organized a quality assurance program to encourage farmers to 
adopt safe practices in the use of livestock medication and to 
highlight the dangers posed by tainted feed 
the animal rights movement also is on the mind of livestock 
producers especially as protests have spread to farm country 
in iowa this spring pickets protested the treatment of animals 
during an appearance of the moscow circus at ames on mothers day 
animalrights activists marched outside a des moines dairy company 
to complain that calves are separated from their mothers and 
illtreated 
the cover of the mayjune edition of peta news a publication of 
the washingtonbased people for the ethical treatment of animals 
has a picture of a pig and a headline did your food have a 
face 
the world pork expo has scheduled a seminar on animal rights 
more and more producers need to know what the issue is and 
what it isnt says pork council spokesman charles harness 
pork producers tend to label the issue one of animal care or 
animal welfare 
we certainly believe in the proper treatment of animals its 
the ethical and moral thing to do harness says we simply do 
not agree that animals have rights equal to humans 
wehler says the industry worries about extremists who want to 
remove meat from our diet 
the pork council will use proceeds from the sale of raffle 
tickets in its squeal of fortune 25000 sweepstakes to support 
efforts on behalf of producers in animal welfare food safety and 
other industry issues 
for those who just love pigs for pigs sake there will be a 
competition for prizes in the pigcasso show of pigoriented art or 
a chance to gawk at the entries featuring pigs in a variety of 
shapes and forms

commodity brokers and their customers are the big winners in the 
agreement by chicagos giant futures exchanges to share an 
electronic trading system 
the unusual pact between the chicago board of trade and the 
chicago mercantile exchange means the futures industry will avoid 
the high costs of duplicate networks costs that ultimately would 
be passed on to customers and the hassle of learning two systems 
david vogel chairman of the futures industry association also 
agreed with the benefit touted by the exchanges when they announced 
the agreement this past wednesday by uniting instead of competing 
the chicago markets stand a better chance of maintaining their 
dominance of global futures trading as financial markets everywhere 
move toward roundtheclock trading 
it looks like 24hour electronic trading is going to come 
about and it will be multinational and competitive in nature 
said vogel chief executive officer of lit america inc a new york 
futures trading concern 
i think its very important that americans be competitive 
here he said 
ever since the merc developed world currency futures in the 
early 1970s touching off a worldwide explosion of financial 
futures and options products the chicago exchanges have seen 
global access as the key to continued us leadership in the 
expanding marketplace 
the problem can be boiled down to two words time zones tokyo 
is about 16 hours ahead of chicago and london is six hours ahead 
to attract business from both of those important financial centers 
the chicago markets ideally would have to be open around the clock 
the board of trade initiated a threehour night trading session 
for interestrate futures early in 1987 to catch the opening of the 
japanese business day the exchange has declared night trading a 
success but concedes it would be impractical to keep its trading 
floor open 24 hours 
in the fall of 1987 the merc announced a different approach in 
partnership with londonbased reuters holdings plc the merc would 
create an automated trading system called globex that would operate 
when its trading floor is closed 
globex would enable traders around the world to buy and sell the 
mercs products and those of other exchanges that chose to 
participate by tapping orders into computer terminals supplied by 
reuters the orders would be matched by a central computer often 
called a black box 
the board of trade initially opposed the concept and asked 
regulators to block it but early last year the board of trade said 
it would develop its own electronic trading system dubbed aurora 
unlike the blind tradematching technology of globex auroras 
screen would mimic a commodity trading pit and enable users to 
select their trading partners the board of trade contended this 
was a superior concept and earmarked 25 million to develop the 
system 
but critics said aurora would be more susceptible to trading 
abuse many brokers led by the futures industry association 
clamored for a single system 
last may the exchanges agreed to explore the possibility of a 
shared system 
the fia from the very beginning promoted this dialogue and 
made it very clear that a single or shared system is what they 
desire vogel said 
the agreement announced by the exchanges does not explain how 
the system will be shared but it does say reuters will be 
involved prompting speculation it will be a black box system and 
that aurora will exist only as a name under which the board of 
trades products will be offered 
the exchanges said they expect the system to be fully 
operational by november

japans motor vehicle exports to the soviet union 
quadrupled last year but the nations big carmakers dont expect a 
sudden breakthrough into the market even though local production 
falls millions short of pentup demand 
the main barrier for japanese automakers as it has been for 
many western businesses is that the soviet ruble is not 
convertible into other currencies making it difficult to 
repatriate any profits 
other problems include lack of repair facilities and other 
infrastructurerelated matters poor coordination among 
autorelated industries and outdated soviet factories 
but in a reflection of interest in the soviet market 10 
japanese automakers participated in a sevenday japan auto industry 
exhibition in moscow in april it was the first industrial fair 
held solely by japanese companies in the soviet union said takashi 
murakami an official of the japan association for trade with the 
soviet union and socialist countries of europe 
although prospects seem poor now the soviet market offers a 
powerful lure demand is estimated at 4 million cars a year but 
only 12 million are produced soviet citizens wait several years 
just to get on a list to buy a car and then have to wait another 
year for delivery 
japan exported 4561 motor vehicles to the soviet union last 
year up from 1313 in 1988 according to the japan automobile 
manufacturers association more than 90 percent of the 1989 total 
were buses and trucks 
japans vehicle exports to the soviet union are dwarfed by its 
shipments to the united states which took 243 million units last 
year 
murakami said japans soviet vehicle exports will remain in the 
range of 4000 to 5000 a year because soviet officials are giving 
higher priority to other consumer goods such as food and clothing 
an official at toyota japans biggest automaker said the 
company exported 2541 vehicles including 409 passenger cars to 
the soviet union in 1989 
toyota participated in the moscow industry exhibition in april 
but did not make a specific deal the official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
mazda motor corp japans fourthlargest automaker recently 
said it will export its first cars to the soviet union 210 mazda 
323s destined for a soviet timber complex in ilimsk siberia 
nissan motor corp the no 2 automaker expects no sudden surge 
of exports in the near future but demand could be strong in the 
long run said a company official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mitsui and co a big trading company which participated in the 
moscow exhibition expects auto exports to increase gradually along 
with the introduction of a market economy in the soviet union 
according to a mitsui official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it will be years before a soviet individual can buy a new 
foreign car though many are wanting one now said the mitsui 
official

the worlds of two of the nations most popular 
investments stocks and real estate are about as far apart as 
they can get right now 
the stock market has been forging ahead reaching a succession 
of record highs over the past two weeks 
the real estate and housing markets on the other hand are 
suffering a protracted period of weakness that extends into many 
parts of the country 
analysts are quick to point out that this divergence is by no 
means unique in the 1970s for example real estate prices surged 
ahead on the crest of a wave of inflation while the stock market 
languished for much of the time 
in theory at least financial observers say the current 
disparity could persist for a similarly long time 
but sooner or later many feel ripple effects from either 
market could exert an influence on the other just how and when 
that might occur is a subject of much debate on wall street 
one theory holds that slumping real estate prices and housing 
starts reflect a squeeze on credit that somehow has failed to make 
an impression yet on investors in the stock market but that sooner 
or later will prove impossible to ignore 
on the opposite side of the argument optimists say the woes of 
real estate and construction may well prompt the federal reserve 
eventually to adopt a stimulative credit policy stoking the stock 
and bond markets with fuel for further gains 
a drop in construction and real estate activity cuts a wide 
swath said michael sherman investment strategist at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
it hits almost every owner of real estate almost every vendor 
in the construction industry and nearly every lender in the 
financial markets the only beneficiaries are those few people who 
have held back before buying or building 
in short a major downturn in this area would be broadly 
deflationary and the fed would know that 
as a consequence if the current weakness we see emerging in 
construction continues and accelerates monetary policy will have 
to change as it does it will enhance the outlook for financial 
assets 
talk of that sort helped stock prices extend their spring rally 
in the past week even with a setback on friday the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials rose 101 to 282092 recording its 
fourth consecutive weekly gain 
the new york stock exchange composite index edged up 016 to 
19371 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 529 to 45360 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 352 at 35984 
volume on the big board averaged 16347 million shares a day 
against 17565 million the week before 
in the eyes of james grant a newsletter publisher and vocal 
bear on the financial outlook stocks look vulnerable to some of 
the same problems that have hurt real estate 
the stock market is a creature of credit he writes in the 
issue of grants interest rate observer published friday it 
cares about the treasury market it depends even more on the cost 
and availability of business credit 
the expansion of credit tends to be bullish and the 
contraction of credit tends to be bearish in the 1980s reckless 
lenders expanded credit in the 1990s timid lenders will shrink it 
it is only 1990 but the contraction is under way it 
therefore stands to reason that stock prices are headed lower

he lied more than he could remember got a big 
tax break from cheating the stock market kept an illegal fortune 
out of government hands and bribed fellow felons with pocket change 
to do his dirty laundry 
those were among the new details that embellished the portrait 
of former stock speculator ivan f boesky under harsh questioning 
in a manhattan federal courtroom this past week and he wasnt even 
on trial 
the gaunt 53yearold inside trader central figure in the 
biggest criminal scandal in wall street history premiered as a 
star prosecution witness in the trial of john a mulheren jr a 
former friend and wall street professional accused of securities 
fraud 
boeskys first public appearance since completing a federal 
prison term last month had been eagerly awaited largely because it 
finally afforded someone hed implicated in his crimes the 
opportunity to confront him 
the faceoff between boesky and mulherens attorney thomas 
puccio riddled with terse and acidic exchanges provided more 
drama than scriptwriters for la law could ever have 
concocted it was a defense lawyers dream 
puccio spent hours seeking to skewer boeskys moral values and 
his selfportrait as a reformed impoverished and humbled exbaron 
of the stock market whod paid his debt to society 
the witness admitted hed lied repeatedly to investigators 
before his plea bargain and took a tax deduction for half his 100 
million insider trading settlement with the government in 1986 
he also admitted the settlement didnt include profits hed 
earned from other insider trading which by some estimates total 
many millions of dollars 
one of the more telling admissions came in a seemingly innocuous 
detail about his life in the lompoc federal prison camp where he 
spent two years asked if hed broken any rules there boesky 
admitted improperly paying other inmates quarters to wash his 
clothes the new york tabloid press seized on it 
boesky cleans up and twobit boesky screamed the 
headlines in the new york post the daily news called it ivans 
dirty laundry 
lawyers following the case said puccio may have succeeded in 
undermining boeskys credibility but that did not mean mulheren 
was any closer to acquittal he faces 41 counts of securities 
fraud mail fraud and other crimes 
ultimately the question for the jury is not ivan boesky alone 
its going to be government witnesses in the aggregate said john 
c coffee jr a columbia law school professor id be very 
surprised if the government rested its factual allegations on just 
boeskys sayso 
stanley arkin a wellknown defense attorney who has represented 
several traders implicated in the wall street fraud scandal said 
federal prosecutors may have made boesky testify early in the trial 
so the jury would forget about him after a couple of weeks 
when the government feels it might have a credibility problem 
with a witness they want to put him on first and get it over 
with arkin said its the strategy of letting time and other 
things heal the inadequacy of the lead witness 
others said it was possible jurors would focus on boeskys 
performance because it was a dramatic point in an otherwise 
complicated trial some said boeskys admissions about his life and 
his image as a squealer who cut a deal to save himself could be 
quite damaging to the governments case 
boesky sounds like hes being as evasive as hell said 
michael feldberg a new york defense attorney and former federal 
prosecutor it sounds like hes not being terribly candid just 
from the impression hes given but ultimately the jurys going to 
decide that 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more signs emerged of an economy thats sluggish but not near 
recession high mortgage rates hurt home april sales in many parts 
of the country the national association of realtors said but the 
commerce department said consumer spending a barometer of economic 
health rose moderately last month 
an air fare skirmish flared just as the summer travel season 
got under way good for consumers but not for the profitability of 
the airline industry major carriers vowed to match discounts 
started by united airlines 
president bush averted a major crisis with china by extending 
its mostfavored nation trading status enabling the country to 
sell goods in the united states at reduced tariffs us business 
that depend on china trade welcomed the move but congressional 
critics pledged to fight it arguing that the bush should punish 
the hardline beijing government for its crackdown on dissent 
the government admitted the cost of the thrift bailout could 
nearly double to as much as 130 billion which could force it to 
borrow enormous amounts of money and consequently put upward 
pressure on interest rates by some estimates the total cost of 
rescuing the nations ailing savings amp loans could reached 300 
billion including interest
