secretary of state george p shultz says a 
shakeup in the soviet hierarchy that swept president andrei a 
gromyko out of the kremlin shows that general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev is intent on pursing his policy of reform 
but shultz was hesitant friday to offer a deeper analysis of the 
changes which also displaced anatoly f dobrynin a former 
ambassador to the united states 
mr gorbachev is a strong and determined person shultz said 
at a news conference he has a major reform program that he is 
working on and if there is any message from this it is that he 
intends to pursue that program 
gromyko is retiring from the politburo while dobrynin is 
leaving his post as foreign policy adviser for the communist party 
both played key roles in relations with the united states for at 
least a quartercentury and shultz had kind words for them 
he called gromyko a strong figure and wished dobrynin well 
the shakeup also downgraded yegor k ligachev from ideology 
chief to supervision of agriculture 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
people are just retiring if you want my comment its a change 
of generation the generation that is coming to power waited in 
the wings maybe for too long 
gromyko who last held the largely ceremonial post of president 
was foreign minister and dobrynin was the soviet envoy to 
washington during the detente period of ussoviet reconciliation 
in the 1970s 
all these changes are restructuring gerasimov told 
reporters here 
shultz recalled working with gromyko in 1985 to reopen 
ussoviet arms control negotiations and on arrangements for the 
summit meeting between president reagan and gorbachev in geneva 
that november 
shultz was reluctant to assess the developments in moscow 
its a little hard and a little early to say what they mean he 
told reporters 
but shultz then added mr gorbachev is a very strong and 
determined person he has a major reform program that he is working 
on and if there is any message from this it is that he intends to 
pursue that program 
for the last three years shultz has been working closely with 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze they have held 30 meetings 
since shevardnadze succeeded gromyko in the post 
i have never had any question in my mind that mr gorbachev 
and mr shevardnadze are in control of their foreign policy said 
shultz 
from the start shultz said shevardnadze was a strong and 
able individual you could see that right away 
phyllis oakley the state department spokeswoman said in 
washington we will of course be studying those changes and 
what they mean for the ussoviet relationship 
reading from a statement the us official added i would 
like to point out that our policy toward the soviet union is based 
on us interests not on personalities or who holds what position 
in moscow 
we have in place a sound framework that can deal with the best 
and worst in soviet behavior we naturally hope and expect that 
ussoviet relations will continue developing in a constructive 
direction as they have in the last seven years at this point i 
have no reason to doubt that those positive trends will continue 
nonetheless mrs oakley had a word of criticism for moscow she 
chided the soviet leadership for having criticized united nations 
peacekeeping forces in afghanistan on the very day earlier this 
week that un peacekeepers worldwide won the nobel peace prize

congress late friday approved a 143 
compromise foreign aid bill and sent it to president reagan after 
stripping out provisions that would have imposed punitive economic 
sanctions against iraq for its alleged use of poison gas against 
the nations kurdish minority 
the house dropped the iraqi sanctions which had been added to 
the bill earlier by the senate without debate after they were 
ruled out of order on procedural grounds that sent the measure 
back to the senate which acceded to the action moments later just 
one minute before the midnight deadline for passage of the bill 
opponents of the sanctions cited state department fears that 
such a move would damage diplomatic efforts to persuade the iraqis 
to forswear use of chemical weapons 
also dropped from the bill were provisions barring the sale to 
china of three us satellites to be launched on the chinese long 
march missile until the president can certify that china is not 
selling missiles to iran iraq syria libya or saudi arabia and 
will not do so in the future the vote to kill that provision was 
23423 
opponents of that section of the bill argued that such a 
prohibition would derail delicate diplomatic arrangements with 
china worked out by defense secretary frank carlucci on a recent 
trip to beijing 
we can be reasonably confident that if we defeat this 
amendment and the sale of american satellites to australia for 
launch on chinese rockets goes forward they will not be selling 
intermediaterange missiles to radical arab countries in the middle 
east said rep steven solarz dny chairman of the house 
foreign affairs asia subcommittee 
in the same stroke the house killed a senate provision that 
would have allowed for prosecution or expulsion of foreign 
diplomats who are accused of serious and violent crimes in the 
united states house leaders said the provision would endanger 
reciprocal agreements protecting us diplomats around the world 
and would tempt a presidential veto of the entire bill 
the senate and house earlier had passed different versions of 
sanctions against iraq with the senate approving a far more 
sweeping version than the house 
earlier the senate shelved 7223 a bid by sen howard h 
metzenbaum dohio to force the overseas private investment corp 
opic to end risk insurance to us companies who set up industries 
in foreign countries and export their products to the united states 
metzenbaum said opics operations cost us jobs by permitting 
us companies to produce their products more cheaply overseas 
the senate also voted 5732 to block a bid by sen steven 
symms ridaho to provide the world bank with 50 million a year 
for the next six years to help finance its operations 
the overall foreign aid spending legislation shifts the emphasis 
to grants rather than loans for us military assistance to foreign 
countries 
over the past few weeks house and senate negotiators drew up a 
program for overseas arms sales that will provide 38 billion in 
outright grants and 410 million in loans made on favorable terms 
the agreement also retained the current military assistance 
program with grants in fiscal year 1989 totaling 467 million 
as in the past the largest recipients for military and economic 
aid were israel and egypt which receive substantial support 
because of their 1979 peace treaty 
israel would receive 12 billion in economic aid and 18 
billion in military assistance egypt would get 815 million in 
economic aid and 12 billion in military aid all of the military 
aid for both countries would be in the form of grants 
consideration of the foreign aid bill lacked the controversy of 
recent years in part because of last years agreement between the 
reagan administration and congress that smoothed the way for the 
years money bills 
it would be the first time in seven years that a separate 
foreign aid bill has been approved usually it has been folded into 
catchall spending bills as congress rushed to adjourn

the landmark welfare overhaul bill awaiting 
president reagans signature has been strongly cheered by most 
lawmakers denounced as unfair by a handful and compared to a coin 
flip by one who wondered if it would work 
its strictly marginal a coin flip said rep bill frenzel 
rminn shortly before the houses 34753 vote friday completing 
congressional action on the family support act 
its a fiveyear 33 billion chance but frenzel declared it 
worth the investment 
the workoriented welfare bill the first fundamental overhaul 
of the system since it was established in 1935 has engendered 
great expectations among many 
its aim transform the system from a longterm trap to a 
shortterm boost a gateway to mainstream economic america for poor 
parents illprepared for the workplace 
its major tool a broad new program called job opportunities and 
basic skills jobs designed to equip young parents and longterm 
recipients with the education training and job experience they 
need to become responsible for their own families 
honest productive creative work is the essential element for 
helping people turn their lives around said rep hank brown 
rcolo a chief architect of the measure it is the greatest 
gift we can provide for those who are less fortunate 
reagan has expressed satisfaction with the bill which sailed 
through the senate 961 on thursday 
liberals complained that the bill which contains work 
requirements is unfair to welfare recipients conservatives 
charged that it wont cut people off the rolls or save taxpayers 
money 
but their complaints were buried under an avalanche of 
bipartisan support for the bill that was painstakingly developed 
over two years of hearings and a summer of intensive negotiations 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee said the end product provides real help not 
promises 
the bill combines carrots and sticks both for the states that 
will have to organize broad job training and education programs 
and for the welfare parents who will have to participate 
states will get the freedom and money to fashion their own jobs 
programs but theyre also told to expand cash benefits to 
twoparent unemployed families a group only 27 states now serve 
to the extent resources are available ablebodied parents with 
children over 3 must participate in jobs but theyll get help with 
child care and transportation costs and a 12month extension of 
child care and medicaid to help ease them into the private 
workforce and those with younger children will only have to 
participate parttime 
rostenkowski said 65000 new families 285000 people will 
receive welfare and medicaid benefits when the rest of the country 
adds twoparent households to the rolls he said up to 400000 
people a year would benefit from jobs and up to 475000 people 
would continue working as a result of the child care and medicaid 
transition benefits 
the most popular aspects of the bill are childsupport 
provisions aimed at snaring more money from noncustodial parents 
states would receive money to identify more fathers and to set up a 
computerized tracking and monitoring system to enforce support 
orders 
furthermore states would have to automatically withhold child 
support from the wages of noncustodial parents in welfare cases 
in 1994 the automatic withholding would be expanded to all child 
support orders not just those affecting welfare families 
among the most controversial provisions is one requiring an 
adult in each twoparent welfare family to participate for 16 hours 
a week in a stateorganized work activity if a job search fails 
some house members expressed frustration with their colleagues 
for abandoning an earlier version of welfare reform that cost twice 
as much as the final compromise it offered states incentives to 
raise cash benefits which are a fraction of the poverty standard 
in some cases and didnt contain the workfare requirement 
there is no justice here this bill should be shelved said 
rep major owens dny 
the welfare system aid to families with dependent children 
established in 1935 serves 37 million families and costs the 
federal government about 85 billion a year

archaeologists sifting through tons of 
discarded earth at a dig on the island of crete have found more 
fragments of a unique goldandivory figurine acclaimed as a 
masterpiece of minoan sculpture 
the ivory torso and arms of a young man were unearthed last 
year they had been partly burned in a fire that swept through a 
prehistoric town at palaikastro on the islands eastern coast 
around 1450 bc 
this summer the excavators recovered more than 100 new 
fragments including shreds of gold leaf from the figures clothing 
two finely modeled ivory feet an ivory ear and surprising of 
all a stone head that would have fitted the missing ivory face 
its the figure of a young god its the most important minoan 
sculpture ever found and we want to recover as much of it as we 
possibly can said dr sandy macgillivray codirector of the 
excavation said in an interview friday 
the minoan civilization was europes earliest high culture 
flourishing in the bronze age between 3000 and 1400 bc 
it was named for legendary king minos who kept a halfman 
halfbull monster known as the minotaur in a labyrinth beneath his 
palace at knossos on crete 
macgillivray who teaches archaeology at columbia university in 
new york said two excavators found the fragments in two months 
of working a water sieve to sift through 4 tons of earth from 
the area where the statue was located 
the figure originally stood 16 inches high and apparently 
shattered when it fell into a courtyard from a shrine in the upper 
story of a large building 
it probably was crafted around 1500 bc in a period that 
produced some of the best minoan art macgillivray said 
it portrayed a shavenheaded young man with a topknot or 
headdress like an american indian standing with arms clenched 
across his bare chest 
the stone head with its topknot was carved from gray 
serpentine we found it in three pieces and thought at first it 
might be a helmet said hugh sackett of groton school in 
connecticut the digs other codirector 
he said two pieces of rock crystal each the size of a seed 
represented the whites of the eye but that the stones used for the 
iris hadnt been found 
theres been a theory the minoans used different materials in 
the same piece of sculpture but this is the first example 
discovered sackett said 
the excavators said dowels on the feet could have fitted into 
wooden legs that were destroyed in the fire they speculate the 
figure wore a gold kilt with a dagger stuck in the belt 
it may be an early representation of the beardless zeus who 
was worshipped on crete later in ancient times macgillivray 
said zeus was the king of the gods in greek mythology and 
according to some accounts was born on crete 
finds from cretan sites of delicately painted vases carved 
gemstones and miniature sculptures indicate the minoans had a keen 
eye for nature and the human form 
the figurine is extremely naturalistic theres evidence of 
very accurate observation in the musculature and especially in the 
rendering of veins and tendons said dr jonathan musgrave who 
teaches anatomy at bristol university in england and has examined 
the figurine on crete 
the restored figurine will go on display in sitia museum in east 
crete next year and the excavators said they will sift through the 
same debris again in search of more fragments 
its tantalizing not to have the eyes but well sieve all the 
earth again next year so we might find them macgillivray said 
the town at palaikastro was destroyed by fire around 1450 bc 
a time when disaster hit minoan settlements all over crete the 
destructions may have been caused by mycenean invaders from 
mainland greece who then reoccupied some of the sites 
we also found fragments of a mycenean drinking cup this year 
the first indication that an east crete site was resettled 
immediately after the destruction macgillivray said 
the palaikastro dig is sponsored by the british school of 
archaeology at athens and the new yorkbased institute for aegean 
prehistory

george bush has struck again at 
democrat michael dukakis home turf a tactic aides say will 
continue as the republican campaign tries to keep the massachusetts 
governor on the defensive 
in a campaign stop kept secret until just a few hours before 
bush on friday scooted to springfield in central massachusetts to 
receive endorsements from local law enforcement groups it was just 
eight days after bush blasted into boston to get the nod from the 
police union there 
the endorsement comes from you who know the truth not just 
about me but about my opponent as well bush said thanking the 
local branch of the international brotherhood of police officers 
and the springfield police department supervisors association 
officer robert jacobson president of the ibpo local said his 
group decided to endorse bush because of his support of the death 
penalty and because of the prison furlough program that dukakis had 
supported 
our members have never supported furloughs for firstdegree 
murderers but michael dukakis did he said until public 
opinion drove him to change his mind they continued 
the program has since been altered to exclude firstdegree 
murderers 
ron kaufman the northeast regional coordinator for the bush 
campaign said the efforts to embarrass dukakis on his home turf 
would continue 
bushs first public events were in new jersey where he also 
received the endorsement of local police groups 
bush was introduced in paterson by passaic county sheriff edwin 
englehardt who chopped at the american civil liberties union its 
a group bush frequently attacks and dares dukakis to quit 
the paterson officers he said dont want a man in that white 
house who is a sympathizer and a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
that great organization thats against everything thats right for 
america 
bush then repeated his blast of dukakis as an aclu member 
dukakis supported the basic revolvingdoor program for 
murderers while he by contrast wanted murders executed bush 
said 
my opponent had the nerve yesterday to come in here and talk 
about oceans you cant swim in bush said you tried to drink 
the water in boston harbor recently dont do it he was 
referring to pollution and not to the brine content of boston 
harbors sea water 
from the paterson municipal center bush went to nearby 
ridgefield memorial high school where he barely mentioned the 
campaign in a softspoken appeal to the students to fight drug use 
bush then returned to the attack in springfield mass where he 
also declared i am running as myself and my opponent is running 
from himself 
he then paid a courtesy call on archbishop john whealon in 
hartford conn and finished the trip with a rally in west 
hartford bush renewed the attack on an array of issues including 
crime and dukakis plan to crack down on tax cheats 
it was wrong to hire three divisions of irs agents to go 
into every kitchen in america looking for people who havent 
paid their fair share of taxes he said 
in washington bush spokesman steve hart disputed a statement by 
former central intelligence agency director stansfield turner that 
bush rehired panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega as a cia 
source in 1981 
turner told several news organizations that he had fired 
noriega the head of panamas military and de facto ruler of the 
country in 1976 because noriega was an unscrupulous character 
the dukakis campaign has made an issue of the reagan 
administrations dealings with noriega up until his recent 
indictment in the united states on drug charges 
the vice president had no public events scheduled today or 
sunday he planned to resume campaigning monday with a trip to 
california to watch the return of the space shuttle

the chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee says presidents should be sworn in earlier because the 2 
months between election day and inauguration day creates an 
unnecessary period of vulnerability 
the incumbent president no longer has real political authority 
and the incoming president lacks constitutional authority and the 
whole world knows it sen claiborne pell dri said friday 
it is a period of vulnerability which can and should be 
eliminated 
in a senate floor speech introducing a resolution for a 
constitutional amendment pell said the change would eliminate 10 
weeks of crippled leadership and avoid an unhealthy and 
unnecessary situation 
the senator wants to move up inauguration day for the president 
and vice president from jan 20 to nov 20 the constitutional 
amendment also would move the swearingin day for congress from 
jan 3 to nov 15 
pell has introduced similar measures in the past with time 
quickly running out in this session of congress action this year 
appears unlikely 
from 1793 to 1933 the swearing in of new presidents took place 
march 4 the 20th amendment pushed it back to jan 20 beginning in 
1937 
pell who introduced the resolution along with sen william v 
roth jr rdel said the move also would avoid lame duck 
administrations in which officials might be tempted to expend 
funds make contracts and grants and promulgate regulations that 
may be either politically motivated or inspired by sheer 
selfinterest 
pell said the development of voting machines and instant 
election result tabulations eliminates the justification for the 
long lag time between elections and inaugurations

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd 
bentsen was off the campaign trail to prepare for his debate with 
republican counterpart dan quayle after returning to the nations 
capital to pick up an endorsement and criticize the gop ticket 
bentsen the texas senator was meeting today with advisers and 
colleagues in advance of his wednesday debate with quayle in omaha 
neb 
among the senators advising bentsen are bill bradley of new 
jersey albert gore jr of tennessee and david boren of oklahoma 
bentsen spokesman michael mccurry said friday 
bentsen aides and several advisers who helped democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis ready for his debate with 
george bush also were involved in the preparations rep dennis 
eckart of ohio has been tapped to stand in as quayle in practice 
sessions 
bentsen spent several hours each day during a fourday trip this 
week studying briefing books on likely debate topics and plans to 
spend sunday monday and tuesday in texas in final preparations he 
also is attending a fundraiser sunday for his senate campaign 
texas law allows him to run for both the vice presidency and 
reelection to the senate 
the campaign trip which ended in washington on friday with 
bentsen accepting the endorsement of the dukakisbentsen ticket by 
the 19 millionmember national education association offered 
contradictory pictures from the bentsen camp on the upcoming debate 
aides repeatedly told reporters quayle was a proven debater 
whose television skills are better than bentsens and whose 
grilling in the news media has lowered expectations to the point 
where it is extremely difficult for bentsen to win 
but the expectations game aside bentsen repeatedly portrayed 
the indiana senator as a legislative lightweight saying quayle had 
an empty resume had opposed most of the progressive bills 
passed by congress this year and that he would pray for bushs 
health if the republican ticket wins the election 
he added bush to that attack friday saying the vice presidents 
talk of balancing the federal budget and serving as the education 
president is as empty as dan quayles resume 
bentsen told the nea gathering he and dukakis have lifelong 
commitments to education and asked them to contrast that to 
education program cuts sponsored by the reagan administration 
for advocates of public education the choice is clear the 
senator told the teachers union which frequently interrupted his 
brief speech with applause 
bentsen also delivered some tough talk on trade and defense 
friday promising that if he and dukakis are elected they will 
demand access to the markets of all countries that have free access 
to us markets bentsen also said he and dukakis would maintain a 
powerful military and nuclear deterrent while calling on us 
allies to pay their fair share of defending the democracies 
bentsen singled out japan during that discussion which took 
place at a rally in charlotte nc he said japan pays far too 
little of the burden of deploying troops and munitions and that it 
should belly up and bear more of the burden

george michael says he is satisfied with the 
turn his career has taken since he went solo with his faith 
album and he doesnt mind being labeled a pop singer 
michael has reason to be satisfied in the two years since the 
breakup of his wham partnership with andrew ridgely michael has 
had five no 1 singles 
faith itself spawned four consecutive no 1 singles 
including the title track from the solo album 
in an interview published in fridays los angeles herald 
examiner michael said he has no problem being identified as a pop 
singer because he respects that end of the music spectrum he 
defended wham a collaboration that resulted in 38 million in 
record sales as serious work 
i dont think there was anything particularly lightweight 
about careless whisper or a different corner he said the 
only thing that was lightweight was the way people perceived the 
image 
mine is still very much a pop image its just that i believe 
more in pop music than most artists do and i dont think you could 
call faith anything other than a pop album its very diverse 
but i think its just an accomplished pop album

the communist party says chinas top economic 
priority for the next two years is to combat inflation which shot 
up about threefold to more than 20 percent in the past year 
officials said friday they will tighten credit ban the resale 
of raw materials and consumer goods and take other measures to 
control a system plagued by hoarding pricegouging and 
profiteering 
the next two years are the most critical period the partys 
policymaking central committee said friday in a communique at the 
end of a fiveday closed meeting 
significant reform measures aimed at checking inflation should 
be taken with urgency said the communique quoted by the official 
xinhua news agency 
the committee called for reducing consumer demand and increasing 
supplies of food textiles consumer products and raw materials in 
order to hold down prices xinhua said 
vice premier yao yilin head of the state planning commission 
said the new policies received unanimous approval during the 
central committee meeting attended by 165 of the 175 members and 
103 alternates 
the simultaneous existence of controlled and free markets has 
encouraged profiteering with many factory officials obtaining raw 
materials from the state at artificially low prices and then 
selling them on the free market for huge profits 
inflation has soared from about 7 percent last year to more than 
20 percent this year due in part to the failure of provincial and 
local officials to comply with repeated orders to approve fewer 
loans cut back on spending and stamp out widespread speculation 
loose central bank control and overissuing of currency have also 
contributed to the problem 
party leaders began signaling in august that a slowdown in price 
reform was planned many economists consider price reform crucial 
to chinas decadelong effort to replace cumbersome central 
planning mechanisms with more flexible market mechanisms 
but governmentordered increases in food prices in may combined 
with speculationfueled increases on the free market triggered 
widespread public discontent and waves of panic buying 
wang deyan president of the bank of china called for strict 
controls on credit as part of the new inflationfighting policy he 
said heads of branch banks should be punished if they disobeyed 
guidelines set by beijing the official peoples daily said friday 
wang said his bank will set rigid loan quotas for its branch 
offices and no loans will be given for private or hotel 
construction or to poorlymanaged enterprises 
he said these measures will give full play to the banks role 
in regulating the national economy the paper said 
in another report friday the economic daily said new 
antiprofiteering measures banned the resale of raw materials 
including petroleum steel aluminum tin rubber and newsprint as 
well as consumer items such as cars motorcycles and televisions 
the industry and commerce administration and the ministry of 
commerce earlier banned the local resale of 22 categories of raw 
materials and consumer durables 
the central committee meeting ended shortly before the 
governments annual gala reception at the great hall of the people 
to celebrate the oct 1 national day holiday 
inside the great hall bedecked with blinking neon lights 
premier li peng and other top government leaders who usually brush 
off reporters questions commented at length on the economy party 
general secretary zhao ziyang who headed the central committee 
session did not attend the event 
in a speech before he toasted the 39th anniversary of the 
communist government li said orders must be obeyed the 
whole nation must reach a common understanding and act in unison 
li also gave more economic bad news grain production will be 
down this year with the fourth disappointing harvest in a row he 
blamed heavy floods in some areas and prolonged drought in others

the house ethics committee apparently has 
begun an informal investigation into whether speaker jim wright 
violated rules against disclosing government secrets when he talked 
openly last week about a purported cia covert operation in 
nicaragua 
on friday the ethics panel asked the house intelligence 
committee to notify it whether wright had been given access to 
classified information from the spy agency on its activities in the 
region 
the senior republican on the intelligence committee rep henry 
hyde of illinois said he was confident the panel would cooperate 
with the request for information even though it declined earlier 
this week to send such information to ethics 
the ethics committees request came as gop members of the 
intelligence committee said they were prepared to ask the full 
house to investigate wright if action were not forthcoming soon 
democrats responded angrily to that announcement charging that 
the move was motivated by politics and by frustrations of contra 
supporters over the perilous state of the antigovernment 
nicaraguan rebels 
i think its mean i think its ugly and i think its beneath 
the dignity of the members of this house said rep david bonior 
dmich 
but the move by the ethics committee was a signal that the 
wright investigation was not being ignored and republicans seemed 
satisfied at least for the moment 
what was sought has been accomplished hyde said i dont 
see any point in airing this at this juncture we are not 
interested in squeezing this for any political advantage we want 
it dealt with 
the controversy began sept 20 when wright answered a 
reporters question by saying he had clear testimony from cia 
people that the agency had recruited agents in nicaragua to stir 
up demonstrations and civil unrest wright said the administration 
hoped to provoke a crackdown by the leftist sandinista government 
and scuttle peace talks with the contras 
wright later elaborated saying the information was elicited 
from the cia under congressional questioning but he subsequently 
denied that he had relied on any such information in making his 
comments saying the agencys role in central america was well 
documented in published material and he has said he feels morally 
obligated to talk about any government action that is contrary to 
its stated support for the regions peace process 
the republican resolution which still could be brought before 
the full house at any time would require the ethics committee to 
investigate the charges and direct other committees including 
intelligence to cooperate by providing relevant information to 
the panel 
but ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said his 
panels pace did not mean the matter had been shelved and he 
accused republicans of being too impatient and eager to stir up 
public controversy 
i think all of this is hype just to keep it going dixon 
said adding that he would not speed up his panels process solely 
to head off a floor debate that could embarrass wright i have 
tried not to react to the political pressure he said 
rep dick cheney rwyo and the other republicans acknowledged 
that it would be difficult to pass the resolution in the 
democratcontrolled house but said they believed important 
institutional principles were at stake including cooperation with 
the executive branch on intelligence matters he denied any 
partisan motive for the move 
it is election time obviously but that hasnt got anything 
to do with the reason we are here he said 
house rules prohibit any disclosure of classified information 
including cia testimony before the intelligence committee 
suspected violations are subject to investigation by the ethics 
committee which already is probing wrights financial and other 
dealings

edita gruberova wont make an operagoer forget 
the excitement of dame joan sutherland or the warmth and pathos of 
beverly sills singing the title role in lucia di lammermoor 
but she did a fine job friday night in her first appearance as 
lucia at the metropolitan opera 
miss gruberova who has a clear voice with superhigh range 
floated some beautiful pianissimos she sang all the embellishments 
and added some of her own her approach was very careful lessening 
excitement a bit 
brian schexnayder sang lucias brother his lustrous baritone is 
more an autumn voice than a winter voice a heavier voice would 
better convey the heavy who makes lucia marry against her 
wishes 
tenor francisco araiza sang edgardo whom lucia loves he has a 
very attractive middle voice that constricts into a less pleasing 
sound at the top of his range stanford olsen sang the smaller part 
of arturo whom lucia marries and then stabs to death offstage 
olsen was a happy surprise audiences dont usually hear such a 
sweet firm lyric tenor in this part 
edoardo muller conducting lucia at the met for the first 
time didnt always seem to be in synch with the chorus but gave 
miss gruberova every consideration during lucias famous mad scene 
in keeping with current practice she didnt race wildly about but 
was gently mad 
the met added a scene that it hasnt had in a production of 
lucia in more than 30 years its a brief scene right before 
the mad scene in which lucias brother visits edgardo to tell him 
that she is married

congress racing against the clock completed 
work friday on the last of 13 spending bills just three minutes 
before the start of the new fiscal year even as president reagan 
chided lawmakers for the dogatemyhomework era of congressional 
budgetry 
it was the first time since 1976 that congress had passed all 13 
separate spending bills 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva said the lawmakers 
accomplishment on the fiscal 1989 spending bills renewed faith 
and confidence in this institution 
at 1157 pm senators accepted by voice vote house language on 
a 143 billion foreign aid measure finishing a marathon day in 
which congress cleared five appropriations bills for fiscal 1989 
two minutes later a puffing house clerk ran into the senate 
chamber carrying the house legislation technically sealing the 
agreement reached by the vote minutes earlier 
fiscal 1988 ended at midnight 
reagan had planned to hold a latenight signing ceremony at the 
white house for the final spending measures but with congress 
still working he canceled the ceremony and instead issued a 
statement complaining about the dogatemyhomework era of 
congressional budgetry 
white house spokesman bill harlow said reagan would have no 
comment on the final passage of all 13 bills until saturday 
had reagan signed the bills before midnight it would have 
marked the first time since 1948 that all 13 spending measures were 
enacted before the start of the fiscal year 
since that time the budget process has been marked by squabbles 
that have resulted in some or all of the spending measures being 
wrapped together that practice rankles presidents because as the 
bills grow to cover more and more federal agencies the political 
consequences of a veto become more serious 
even though the fiscal year opened saturday without the 
presidents signature on six of the bills the effect will be 
almost nil 
few federal employees work over the weekend and even without 
spending legislation in place essential workers would report 
including the military doctors air traffic controllers and 
others but if all the spending bills are not enacted by monday 
agencies for which money has not been provided would not be able to 
keep their doors open 
the house opened business friday by approving a 282 billion 
defense department spending measure on a 32777 vote and sent it to 
the senate the senate later approved it but added some provisions 
which sent the bill back to the house as both chambers must 
approve identical bills the house concurred with the changes 
the senate also voted 904 in favor of a houseapproved 466 
billion agriculture bill and sent it to reagan 
all told reagan has signed seven fiscal 1989 appropriations 
bills into law most recently the 108 billion transportation bill 
on friday the first was a 178 billion measure for energy and 
water projects enacted on july 19 
as the midnight deadline approached friday the senate gave 
final approval to a 32 billion district of columbia 
appropriations bill that carried a strong antiabortion amendment 
and gave georgetown university the right to deny certain rights to 
gay groups 
dc delegate walter fauntroy angered by the intrusion into 
local affairs said he would encourage city officials to disobey 
the abortionfunding prohibition to trigger a congressionally 
mandated shutdown of city government such a move would leave 
congress with the responsibility of governing the nations capital 
the federal government contributes 537 million to the dc 
government 
as the clock ticked on legislation providing 18 billion for 
congress own operating expenses received final approval that left 
the 143 billion foreign aid measure 
the uncharacteristic rapidity with which the spending measures 
were being completed this year is largely due to last novembers 
budget summit agreement between reagan and congressional leaders 
that pact set the broad spending targets for 1989 and set a tone 
in which administration and capitol hill officials consulted 
frequently in an effort to resolve disputes 
it shows what can happen when the president and congress 
cooperate byrd said 
last years budget process produced nothing but partisan 
brawling over spending levels and taxes with neither the 
administration nor congress willing to budge the beginning of 
fiscal 1988 came and went without the passage of a single 
appropriations bill 
what emerged and not until late december three months into 
the fiscal year was a 1400page 600 billion measure wrapping 
all 13 spending bills into one 
reagan signed the measure but in january he promised on 
national television to never again sign an omnibus spending bill 
and scores of lawmakers pledged to send the bills to the white 
house one at a time

iran and iraq said greeces foreign minister after he met with 
officials from both countries 
foreign ministers tariq aziz of iraq and ali akbar velayati of 
iran gave no hint of progress but both expressed cautious optimism 
about the negotiations before todays facetoface meeting 
the two persian gulf neighbors and enemies are observing a 
unbrokered ceasefire in their 8yearold war which has caused 
more than a million casualties 
perez de cuellar and his special representative to the talks 
swedish un ambassador jan k eliasson held separate meetings 
friday evening with aziz and velayati 
all four arranged to meet today for the first round of direct 
talks between aziz and velayati since the last round of 
negotiations ended in geneva sept 13

security 
the building will be buttoned up said a us secret service 
agent 
the state department has provided velayati with a bulletproof 
armorplated blue cadillac limosine he said 
greek foreign minister karolos papoulis met separately with 
velayati and aziz on friday and later said he discussed the war 
with both men 
efforts have been undertaken on the part of the 
secretarygeneral to resolve the deadlock that has evolved in that 
area and always there is hope that the deadlock will be 
overcome papoulis said 
papoulias is the chairman of the council of foreign ministers of 
the 12 european community nations 
when the geneva talks halted iraq demanded that the next step 
must be that the shattalarab waterway dividing the two nations be 
cleared of sunken ships and silt so it is navigable again it is 
iraqs only outlet to the persian gulf 
iran insisted that the remaining provisions of security 
councils 1987 resolution 598 be implemented before dealing with 
other issues 
the two belligerents have observed a truce since aug 20 the 
first demand of resolution 598 and five days later opened peace 
talks another provision 
the remaining requirements are to withdraw their forces to the 
border exchange prisoners of war continue peace talks to settle 
their differences and that an impartial commission be appointed to 
apportion blame for the outbreak of the war 
aziz was asked on friday en route to his meeting with perez de 
cuellar wheter he was hopeful of a breakthrough and he said he was 
but did not elaborate 
after the meeting aziz was asked if any breakthroughs were in 
the offing especially on the shattalarab and he answered 
i dont want to make any hasty conclusions because we have not 
yet met the iranians and we will see if they have anything new 
suggesting baghdad is holding fast and looking for compromise on 
irans part 
velayati told reporters when he emerged from his meeting with 
perez de cuellar we do hope that during these talks in new 
york we could reach a tangible result and we hope that we could 
reach a concrete conclusion for the implementation of the other 
provisions of resolution 598 
his comments indicated tehran has not altered its bargaining 
position 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said we 
should be hopeful diplomats must always be hopeful we have no 
other choice

president reagan says the us government is 
doing everything we can to gain the release of the hostages 
held in lebanon but denied his administration is engaged in direct 
negotiations with iran 
reagan was queried about a published report in an israeli 
newspaper which said a deal is in the works to release the 
hostages possibly as soon as oct 7 
the president campaigning in illinois on behalf of vice 
president george bush told reporters we have no direct 
negotiations or have we had with iran at any time in this 
certainly there has been no contact between us and the 
kidnappers the president said 
the american hostages are believed to be held by a proiranian 
group in lebanon 
an israeli newspaper reported friday that eight americans and 
one briton held hostage in lebanon will be freed in october as a 
result of secret talks between the united states and iran 
the report said that in exchange for the release washington 
will provide economic aid gradually release billions of dollars in 
iranian funds frozen in us banks and resume diplomatic relations 
with tehran the englishlanguage weekly the nation said in a 
report from geneva 
lunching at a picnic table at a polish social club known as 
wozniaks casino reagan told reporters we are doing everything 
we can to get them back but these rumors and reports are out about 
negotiations all i can say is they must be coming from iran 
because theyre not true 
the israeli newspaper had reported that a prospective 
usiranian deal would result in the release of five americans 
possibly by oct 7 with a subsequent liberation of three remaining 
americans at a later point 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters aboard air 
force one en route to chicago that there have been no deals as 
outlined in these stories 
when asked if he was flatly denying that the united states was 
conducting negotiations with the hostages fitzwater replied 
thats right 
i dont deny that there are people talking to iran about the 
hostages but no us officials are talking to them he said 
there is no one authorized to make a deal for hostages or do 
anything that is contrary to our policy 
the spokesman said that while there had been no direct contact 
between officials of the us government and officials of the 
revolutionary government of the ayotollah ruhollah khomeini the 
problem is we hear stories like this from sources all over the 
middle east 
there have been no facetoface negotiations fitzwater 
added though he said there have always been thirdparty 
contacts 
there have been no talks that we directed or participated in 
the problem is i cannot account for other people who may have 
been talking to iran fitzwater said 
he said the administration had no information about the 
newspapers report of an assassination attempt on iranian 
parliamentary speaker hashemi rafsanjani although he said weve 
seen those reports 
us officials accompanying reagan on the midwest trip declined 
to discuss the question of possible contacts with iran through 
intermediaries the united states has often communicated with iran 
through thirdparty swiss representatives in the years since 
khomeinis revolutionary government overthrew the shah of iran 
the united states has said repeatedly that iran must release the 
hostages held by elements sympathetic to its cause administration 
officials say the united states would be willing to talk to 
authoritative iranian government figures but without preconditions 
our policy is still no deals fitzwater said

britain said it is resuming full 
diplomatic relations with iran on the basis of reciprocity and 
mutual respect us secretary of state george p shultz quickly 
made it clear that america was not about to follow suit 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe announced the move 
friday after meeting with irans foreign minister ali akhbar 
velayati 
the action accelerated an improvement in western relations with 
the fundamentalist government in tehran of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeinei and iran evidently wants to advance toward a more normal 
position around the world 
shultz told a news conference that any us settlement with iran 
required an end to the iraniraq war an end to terrorism and the 
release of americans believed held by proiranian forces in lebanon 
there is no change in the situation as far as the united 
states and iran is concerned he said 
britain withdrew its diplomats from tehran last year after a 
british envoy was beaten and kidnapped in apparent reprisal for the 
arrest of an iranian consul in manchester england on shoplifting 
charges the diplomat was released 24 hours later 
britain and iran did not break diplomatic relations but ties 
were badly strained and only the iranian charge daffaires was 
allowed to stay in london 
on friday iranian charge daffaires mohammad basti said in 
london full diplomatic relations are to be restored and we hope 
it will be at ambassadorial level 
friends of john mccarthy an organization campaigning for the 
release of one of britains hostages believed held by proiranian 
guerrillas in lenbanon said in london that it welcomed howes 
announcement and hopes that the fate of john mccarthy terry 
waite and brian keenan will be a top priority in the ongoing 
discussions between iran and britain 
tv journalist mccarthy was kidnapped in beirut on april 17 1986 
anglican church envoy terry waite disappeared in beirut jan 20 
1987 no group has ever made a claim of responsibility in that 
disappearance 
teacher brian keenan from belfast in northern ireland who has 
dual british and irish nationality was seized in lebanon on april 
11 1986 
prime minister margaret thatchers government has repeatedly 
refused to enter into bargaining for the release of british 
hostages 
in another development prime minister hussein musavi of iran 
denied a report friday that said he tried to resign because foreign 
policy decisions including support for operations such as 
hijackings were made behind his back 
musavi said the british broadcasting corp report could 
adversely affect efforts to normalize relations with britain 
according to the official islamic republic news agency monitored 
in cyprus 
irna quoted musavi as saying he tried to resign in august 
because he dreaded a noconfidence vote against his new cabinet in 
parliament he withdrew the resignation after khomeini sent him an 
open letter calling it surprising 
the bbc reported that musavi had said he was resigning because 
his government was powerless and decisions were being taken that 
had disastrous effects for iran the bbc cited confidential letters 
between musavi and president ali khamenei 
the bbc said the documents were leaked to members of the majlis 
or parliament but it did not specify how they came out of iran 
the documents made available to the associated press in cyprus 
indicate deep divisions within the iranian government

anatoly f dobrynin moscows man in washington 
from the cuban missile crisis to the reform era of mikhail 
gorbachev was known in diplomatic circles as an astute analyst of 
us affairs and a key foreign policy adviser 
dobrynin 68 retired from his position as secretary of the 
powerful communist party central committee on friday in a major 
reorganization of the top party apparatus that broadened 
gorbachevs base of support 
dobrynins smoothness and ability earned him praise from former 
us ambassador to moscow malcolm toon who called him one of the 
ablest diplomats of the 20th century 
alexander n yakovlev the soviet ambassador to canada during 
some of dobrynins years in washington and one of gorbachevs 
closest advisers was assigned responsibility for international 
policy in a streamlined central committee structure 
no reason was given for dobrynins retirement from the job in 
which he had a key voice on soviet foreign policy decisions 
president andrei a gromyko who was dobrynins boss for many years 
as soviet foreign minister also stepped down friday from the 
communist partys ruling politburo 
the tall and portly dobrynin was recalled to moscow in march 
1986 after 24 years in washington during that time he became 
viewed as the dean of the diplomatic corps and gained respect as an 
astute analyst of us policies 
far less was known of his work in moscow where he was in the 
public eye much less than in washington in one wellpublicized 
trip he accompanied foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to 
afghanistan in january 1987 before the prosoviet government 
announced a policy of national reconciliation with antimarxist 
rebels 
in the us capital dobrynin personified the backchannel 
diplomacy of sensitive secret dealings between the superpowers 
he was an unswerving defender of soviet policies but won respect 
of highranking us officials for being able to get their point of 
view across in the kremlin 
although he appeared largely unchanged by living in the united 
states for more than two decades dobrynin was fond of taking his 
granddaughter to fast food restaurants on saturdays 
dobrynin long had special access to the us state department 
and secretaries of state invited him in for drinks and private 
chats 
but during the first years of the reagan administration 
thensecretary of state alexander m haig revoked dobrynins 
privilege of using the departments garage entrance and private 
elevator a practice that had allowed dobrynin to avoid the press 
dobrynin who spoke fluent but heavily accented english was 
born nov 16 1919 near moscow his father was a plumber 
he was an aeronautical engineer during world war ii and entered 
diplomatic service afterward he worked at the foreign ministry in 
moscow until 1952 when he was sent to washington as a embassy 
counselor 
he returned to moscow in 1960 to become chief of the foreign 
ministrys us and latin american department two years later he 
returned to washington as ambassador

democrat michael dukakis stood behind his 
record on environmental issues telling california voters that as 
massachusetts governor his state outperformed the reagan 
administration in cleaning up toxic waste 
dukakis stressing the environmental theme as he usually does 
when campaigning in california also said he would convene 
serious summits on the environment when dealing with the 
soviets 
dukakis flew to this key electoral state friday and immediately 
made a quick visit to the stringfellow acid pits one of the 
nations most notorious toxic waste sites 
then he held a town meeting in riverside before flying north to 
a series of fundraising events in san francisco and sacramento 
the major event on todays schedule was a speech on ocean dumping 
at an environmental rally 
most of the questions he received in riverside concerned the 
environment including one about an issue george bush has raised 
effectively against dukakis 
the bush campaign has been running television ads the past week 
that show scenes of the pollution in boston harbor and that blame 
dukakis for not acting swiftly to clean it up 
i consider the cleanup of boston harbor to be one of the finer 
achievements of my administration the massachusetts governor 
said he said that under his leadership the largest single water 
cleanup project in america was under way to reduce the harbor 
pollution 
the multibilliondollar project was being carried out with a 
minimium of federal assistance he said dukakis opponents and 
critics insist he was part of the problem because he delayed taking 
decisive action much earlier 
dukakis said people in riverside who have lived near 
stringfellow should know that his state was the first that passed 
and im the first governor who signed a state superfund law to 
provide funds to clean up toxic waste dumps 
weve now cleaned up up almost 300 sites and were working on 
another 400 he said the current administration has completed 
about 25 or 30 
dukakis also said that he discussed the environment wednesday 
when he met with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
environmental pollution knows no boundaries said the 
democratic nominee were not only going to have serious summits 
on arms control were going to have serious summits on the 
environment 
on the flight to california state assembly speaker willie brown 
said the environment and drugs will probably be mr dukakis 
strongest issues in california against bush 
brown who supported jesse jackson for the democratic 
presidential nomination said his presence on the dukakis plane was 
evidence the party was united 
in another part of the west dukakis won a newspaper endorsement 
from the seattle times which has endorsed only republican 
presidential candidates since 1920 
the endorsement editorial that will appear in sundays editions 
said dukakis had shown a broader deeper understanding of the 
economies of the states and nation

a highlevel advisory commission on deficit 
reduction after trying to keep out of the spotlight by holding 
closeddoor meetings is going back to public hearings 
the national economic commission announced friday that it will 
hold a public session next wednesday its first since midjuly 
the announcement came after one commissioner objected to the 
strategy of keeping the sessions secret until after the 
presidential election 
the 12member panel which was created by congress to come up 
with solutions to the huge federal budget deficits held three 
meetings in august and september purposely without a quorum to get 
around open meeting requirements of the federal advisory committee 
act 
at those sessions the commissioners heard testimony on such 
politically sensitive topics as social security and possible new 
sources of revenue to close the gap between spending and taxes 
the panel chaired by democrat robert strauss and republican 
drew lewis is working against a dec 21 deadline to make its 
recommendations to a new president 
in a speech earlier this week commission member dean kleckner 
president of the american farm bureau federation said the 
commission was wrong to keep its deliberations out of the spotlight 
to avoid becoming embroiled in the presidential election 
should the commission over the very strong objections of 
several of us become a taxhike vehicle then the 
revenueversusspending issue should be must be debated ahead of 
nov 8 he said the people who pay the bill ought to have a 
chance to express themselves 
commission spokesman james hildreth said the commissions 
decision to resume public hearings occurred because commissioners 
were starting to get nervous that they might be technically in 
violation of the law because too many people would show up 
he said that the last briefing session would have actually had 
eight members present if airline flights of two commissioners had 
not been delayed because of bad weather 
there was just a general uneasiness that perhaps we had better 
do something to make sure we didnt get involved in any diverting 
controversy about violating laws hildreth said we are not 
trying to do anything illegal secretive or anything else 
thentreasury secretary james a baker had urged the commission 
in march to keep its deliberations out of the public eye during the 
presidential campaign baker had argued that the panels findings 
would carry more weight if they did not become embroiled in 
electionyear politics baker is now chairman of george bushs 
presidential campaign 
the commission is composed of six republicans and six democrats 
with two other members to be named by the presidentelect after 
nov 8 
hildreth said no decisions had been made at any of the meetings 
so far and none will be made until after the presidentelect 
appoints his members 
the wednesday session will hear testimony on government benefit 
programs other than social security and new priorities that the 
government may be asked to fund in a new administration hildreth 
said two other sessions on health care and defense are planned 
before the election and they would also be open

share prices slumped during the last trading day of 
the week saturday and shed all the gains made the previous day 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues closed the 
halfday session at 2770013 points down a heavy 22354 points or 
080 percent the index a 22354point winner friday lost exactly 
the same amount it gained the previous day 
share prices were lower mainly because its saturday when 
trading usually slows down said an analyst with nomura 
securities japans largest brokerage 
he said japans economic outlook was quite good for investment 
and added that the nikkeis decline was not serious 
other dealers said the index dropped because investors were 
inclined to sell stocks for profit after the gain friday 
otherwise there was no negative economic factor in the market 
except for a lack of energy they said 
due to the lack of specific direction trading was rather thin 
with volume on the first section totaling 550 million shares

farmers who grow corn and most other feed 
grains in 1989 will have to idle only 10 percent of their base 
acreage to qualify for price supports and other government benefits 
this year farmers had to set aside 20 percent under the acreage 
reduction program or arp to qualify for benefits but drought cut 
yields sharply and siphoned off much of the nations grain 
stockpile thus restrictions were eased on next years plantings 
signup dates will be announced later agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng said friday 
besides corn the 10 percent arp will apply to 1989 crops of 
sorghum and barley oats will have a 5 percent idling requirement 
the same as in 1988 
lyng also announced some other provisions of the 1989 feed grain 
program including 
target prices for 1989 corn will be 284 per bushel down from 
293 this year sorghum 270 per bushel down from 278 
barley 243 per bushel down from 251 and oats 150 per 
bushel down from 155 
price support loan rates for corn will be 165 per bushel 
down from 177 this year sorghum 157 per bushel down from 
168 barley 134 per bushel down from 144 oats 85 cents 
per bushel down from 90 cents and rye which has no arp or target 
price 140 per bushel down from 150 
no marketing loan program will be implemented for feed grains 
in 1989 unchanged from 1988 
malting barley will not be exempt from acreage limitation 
requirements established for the 1989 program 
there will be no paid land diversion a feature that would pay 
farmers for taking additional acres from production 
in another report the department said us grain inventories as 
of sept 1 included an estimated 426 billion bushels of corn from 
previous years harvests down 13 percent from 488 billion bushels 
a year earlier 
sorghum stocks were at 663 million bushels down 11 percent from 
743 million bushels a year earlier 
barley stocks were estimated at 441 million bushels but there 
was no comparison with a year earlier no oats figures were 
reported for sept 1 
the sept 1 soybean inventory at 302 million bushels was down 
31 percent from a year agos 436 million bushels 
wheat stockpiles were reported at 224 billion bushels down 25 
percent from sept 1 1987

discoverys launch may start a new 
era for nasa but the astronauts still face one problem thats 
always bothered space travelers an uncomfortable comfort station 
during the 32 months the shuttle was grounded after challenger 
nasa made more than 200 changes aboard the craft but improving the 
space potty was not one of them astronauts still must contend with 
an orbiting john that has been known to turn a simple call of 
nature into a complex maneuver 
when the shuttle toilet was first installed it was said to be 
the final solution to a problem that has bothered astronauts since 
space travel began 
early astronauts learned that responding to a simple human need 
in space required a lot more effort than back home on earth there 
is gravity and something deposited somewhere tends to stay there 
but in space there is no gravity and anything not tied down or 
contained tends to float around 
during the gemini and apollo programs engineers designed 
systems that used flowing air to collect liquid wastes for solid 
wastes there were blue plastic bags that sealed after use 
astronauts hated the bags some resisted using the bags so strongly 
that they required medical attention upon return to earth 
for the shuttle engineers designed a space toilet filled with 
machinery and valves that promised the final solution for both 
genders the problem was to be solved with whirling blades 
freezedrying and collection by vacuum 
it was an almost immediate failure 
the system was so complicated that it required some fundamental 
toilet training on the ground and once in space astronauts found 
that equipment designed to remain pristine and fresh often became 
clogged and cranky after some missions the shuttle returned to 
earth smelling like an overused portable toilet 
the system was modified time after time but the complaints 
continued 
searching for answers johnson space center officials held 
closed door meetings with each returning astronaut hoping that the 
intrepid space fliers would recount personal anecdotes that would 
solve the problem but the terrors of the space toilet continued 
now an engineer at aerospace contractor hamilton standard co in 
windsor locks conn has proposed a system that officials hope 
will silence complaints 
don w rethke nicknamed dr flush by his coworkers 
designed a toilet that he says is simple sanitary and odorfree 
rethke said he originally designed the system for the space 
station the proposed orbiting laboratory where astronauts will 
live for months 
the hamilton standard design uses collection bags that are 
mounted in a device that resembles the commode back home the bags 
are automatically sealed compressed and stored in canisters and 
its simple astronauts merely push a button and wait for the 
machine to cycle they then insert a new bag for the next user and 
go on their way 
rethke said the space station system will collect and purify 
liquid waste and even recycle it for hygienic use 
nasa officials were so impressed with the concept they asked dr 
flush to submit a proposed design for the space shuttle other 
aerospace contractors also may submit designs but it was rethkes 
ideas that got the plan started 
they nasa engineers are tired of trying to solve the old 
problem he said this is a very simple system that may be the 
solution 
americas astronaut corps hopes so

federal savings and loan regulators have 
wrapped up a sixweek 16 billion spending spree by pledging 25 
billion to the rescue of six ailing thrifts in texas 
the acquiring companies have agreed to put up 153 million in 
two separate deals and in return will acquire control of sampls with 
assets worth 44 billion 
federal home loan bank board chairman m danny wall who has 
been criticized by members of congress for agreeing to thin 
deals bringing little private money to sampl rescues said the 
millions of dollars being invested proves again the texas 
thrift market is an excellent business opportunity 
however a review of nine packages rescuing 42 texas 
institutions this year shows that regulators have committed 22 
billion in aid while bringing in capital of only about 300 
million 
in the biggest deal announced friday a joint venture headed by 
templeinland inc of dibold texas is getting 149 billion in 
assistance from the federal savings and loan insurance corp to 
acquire three institutions with combined assets of 319 billion 
templeinland a forestry company will get 80 percent of the 
new institutions stock while trammel crow co a dallasbased 
real estate development and management company and mason best co 
a private merchant banking firm also based in dallas will get 10 
percent each 
together the three firms are investing 128 million 
in the second transaction club corporation international of 
dallas one of the nations largest operators of private dining and 
country clubs has received a commitment from the fslic worth 
9995 million for an investment of 25 million club is getting 
control of three institutions with combined assets of 12 billion 
in six weeks beginning aug 18 the fslic which guarantees sampl 
deposits up to 100000 has committed more than 16 billion to 
shut down or merge more than 60 institutions including 32 in texas 
and 14 in oklahoma states hard hit by problems in the oil industry 
and by lax sampl regulation 
the recent spate of transactions represent about half the 124 
sampl cases resolved by regulators so far this year 
wall the nations top sampl regulator had announced he was 
spending as much federal assistance as possible before the 1988 
fiscal year ended friday so that much of it would not count toward 
the budget deficit however he conceded this week that he had been 
mistaken and that there were only a few minor advantages to rushing 
rep charles schumer dny has said the recent string of 
transactions are a political shell game by republicans intended 
postpone any crisis until after the election 
the bank boards spree has intensified debate over whether a 
taxpayer bailout of the sampl insurance fund will be needed next 
year so far the fslic has received all of its money through an 
assessment on the industry 
congress general accounting office has estimated it will cost 
45 billion to 50 billion to clean up the industry of 3000 
institutions nationwide 500 are considered insolvent and another 
400 close to insolvent 
bruce steinberg an economist with merrill lynch is estimating 
that if the gao pricetag proves correct the federal budget deficit 
over the next three years will be nearly 15 billion a year higher 
the sampl crisis emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign 
on thursday when democrat michael s dukakis blamed the mess on the 
deregulation policies of the reagan administration the campaign of 
republican george bush in turn has attributed the problem to 
footdragging by the democratic congress 
the three institutions being acquired by templeinland and its 
partners are guaranty federal savings and loan association 
headquartered in dallas with 33 branches first federal savings and 
loan of austin with 22 branches and delta savings of texas with 
eight branches in and around alvin texas 
among the reasons listed by the bank board for the failure of 
the three are highrisk lending to avoid recognizing losses 
conflicts of interest unauthorized securities trading speculative 
commercial loans poor underwriting practices and deficient real 
estate appraisals 
club international through a wholly owned subsidiary first 
federal financial corp is taking control of three austinbased 
sampls creditbanc savings association franklin savings association 
and great west savings bank 
in two small deals in indiana on friday the bank board provided

two fishermen survived 32 days 
adrift in a small boat by catching fish and drinking their blood 
they said today after being admitted to a hospital in new zealand 
iaira mauerere 32 and sera toaea 28 both kiribati islanders 
were picked up by a south korean refrigerated cargo ship on 
september 21 after drifting 1500 miles 
they were transported to the new zealand port of tauranga after 
being discovered by the cargo vessel kohufu they were expected to 
be released from the hospital this afternoon neither was seriously 
hurt 
fish was the only way we survived mauerere said from 
tauranga hospital 
the pairs ordeal began on august 20 when mauerere an assistant 
fisheries officer for the kiribati governments fisheries division 
invited toaea a fisherman to join him on a sixhour trip to 
deliver three men to an island in the kiribati group 
they set off from tarawa the island capital in a fisheries 
division 28foot fibreglass open boat with an outboard motor 
on the return trip the motor broke down 
the men had only a basket of babai a vegetable similar to a 
potato some coconuts and some drinking water 
to protect themselves from the sun and cool winds at night they 
pulled up some of the interior boards in the base of the boat and 
erected a shelter tied together by trawler line 
after nine days the food ran out on the 18th day the water ran 
out 
during the ordeal they slept fished and swam they ate the fish 
raw 
mauerere said they had dried fish on board but once their water 
was used up they had to survive on raw fresh fish to keep up their 
moisture intake 
he said the duo recalled reading about others who had survived 
at sea by sucking blood from the tails of fish 
we were a bit scared about drinking this but thought lets 
try this is the only way we have to survive he said 
both men said they vomited but managed to glean sufficient 
moisture from the fish blood 
we were lucky to be saved mauerere said sera was upset 
because he thought we could have died i said no get rid of 
those bad memories we have to start a new life on this beautiful 
boat 
the men both married spent an additional eight days on the 
south korean vessel before sighting land

afghan officials have reiterated soviet 
claims that pakistan is sheltering training and arming islamic 
rebels who launch raids across the border into afghanistan 
the provision of modern weapons including stingers 
longrange artillery and mortars and groundtoground rockets to 
the extremist opposition groups and their transfer to afghanistan 
is continuing said abdul wakil kabuls foreign minister on 
friday 
the united states is still continuing the dispatch of weapons 
and equipment to armed extremist groups he continued accusing 
pakistani militias of joining attacks in the afghan regions of spin 
boldak kandahar and the kunars 
pakistans centers of of training arming and equiping of 
armed extremist groups on its territory have not been dismantled 
wakil said in his speech to the 43rd general assembly 
he contended that afghanistan has never resorted to small or 
largescale border violations either from land or air and has 
nothing to do with the internal incidents occurring in its 
neighboring countries 
pakistan says afghan warplanes have mounted numerous air raids 
on pakistans border villages and afghan refugee camps to punish 
the rebels and also accuses kabul of sponsoring terrorist bombings 
in pakistan 
wakil said that kabul has brought 547 cases of violations of the 
geneva accords on afghanistan to the attention of pakistan and the 
un good office mission to afghanistan and pakistan ungomap 
he accused pakistan of delaying ungomaps investigation of the 
alleged shipment and transfer of weapons across the border on the 
pretext of the existence of tribal conflicts and lack of security 
soviet foreign ministry gennady gerasimov said thursday that 
ungomap officials are not doing their job properly and should 
be investigated by the secretarygeneral if future peacekeeping 
forces are to be approved 
the afghan accords signed april 14 in geneva by pakistan and 
afghanistan with the soviets and americans as guarantors call for 
the soviets to withdraw more than 100000 red army troops from 
afghanistan and for afghanistan and pakistan to respect each 
others territorial integrity 
on tuesday soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnaze said 
the soviets had finished the first part of their troop withdrawal 
but had not yet begun the second phase and said it depended on 
whether the violations of the accord cease 
un observers have agreed that half the soviet troops withdrew 
by aug 15 so shevardnadzes statement meant the red army retreat 
has stopped for the last six weeks the withdrawal began may 15 
and is to be complete by feb 15 1989 
diego cordovez who mediated the afghan accord when he was a 
un undersecretary said thursday i am surprised that mr 
gerasimov has been complaining about the monitoring mechanism 
ungomap because i had a oneandahalfhour meeting with mr 
shevardnadze and he said nothing to me about it 
cordovez recently left his un post to become foreign minister 
of ecuador

attorneys for the 311 hispanic fbi agents 
who successfully sued the agency for ethnic discrimination say they 
hope the ruling will have a domino effect in rectifying bias 
its a landmark decision because discrimination against 
hispanics in this society is pervasive said antonio silva 
cocounsel for the agents in the class action suit 
the other cocounsel hugo rodriguez said fridays decision 
determined that the department of justice of which the fbi is a 
part discriminates 
if they do it exists in other institutions in this country 
he said 
were hoping that itll have a domino effect that people will 
look at themselves and say lets anticipate the problem before we 
have it 
the attorneys spoke at a news conference hours after us 
district judge lucius bunton issued a 95page opinion friday that 
said the fbi was guilty of a pattern and practice of 
discrimination relating to conditions of employment and 
promotions 
bunton said the question of damages will be dealt with later 
fbi director william sessions said he was disappointed by the 
ruling but added discrimination has no place in the fbi he 
said the agency will decide later whether to appeal 
in the meantime he said the fbi will continue to strengthen 
its discriminationcomplaint process and managementassessment 
program 
the fbi and i as the director are committed to increasing 
the number of minority and female agents within the fbis ranks 
while ensuring promotional opportunities for these agents 
sessions said 
the fbis 437 hispanic agents comprise 45 percent of the 9574 
agents hispanics make up about 8 percent of the us population 
attorney general richard thornburgh said he plans to meet with 
sessions to discuss the decision 
it obviously raises some concern and well follow through on 
it he said 
the plaintiffs argued during a twoweek nonjury trial in 
august that the fbi promotes hispanic agents slower and assigns 
them lessdesirable jobs than other agents 
the same could be said of other employers rodriguez said 
adding that hispanic employees from several government agencies and 
private corporations have called him to seek advice about what to 
do about alleged discrimination 
if i was a ceo of a major corporation i think i would take a 
long hard look not only at my product line as to whether we 
address the hispanic audience but whether we are doing what is 
just to hispanic employees rodriguez said 
bunton agreed with the hispanic agents claims that they were 
usually assigned to spanishlanguage wiretaps even if nonhispanic 
agents who were more fluent in spanish were available 
working wiretaps is boring lonely uncomfortable work agents 
testified and the lowglamour job goes unrecognized and unrewarded 
when promotions are handed out 
bunton agreed with that too as well as with agents assertions 
that hispanics are more likely to be called on to do dangerous 
undercover work even when nonhispanics could do the job as well 
the judge also accepted the plaintiffs arguments that the 
agencys discriminationcomplaint process is weak and that 
hispanics are rated unfairly low in the managementassessment 
program which they must complete with high scores to be considered 
for higher management positions 
justice has been done said fbi agent bernardo matt 
perez who was the highestranked hispanic in the fbi when he filed 
the original lawsuit five years ago we now feel that we are 
complete firstrate american citizens and we have complete rights 
this is going to better the fbi and i hope that sessions will 
read this very closely

a house vote is expected next week on 
legislation that would impose the firstever restrictions on 
lobbying by exmembers of congress and former presidents and vice 
presidents 
the house judiciary committee by voice vote friday cleared the 
measure for floor action late next week in addition to its new 
restrictions the bill would expand existing lobbying prohibitions 
on former executive branch employees 
senior vice president ann mcbride of the selfstyled citizens 
lobby common cause called the committee vote a major step 
forward in the battle to enact this important ethics legislation 
the senate already has approved its own set of lobbying 
restrictions for those who quit the executive branch or leave 
congress both measures are aimed at those who leave the government 
and then immediately lobby their former colleagues usually on 
issues with which they were involved 
the american civil liberties union has sounded a cautionary 
note writing lawmakers that wholesale reform of the ethics laws 
is neither necessary nor desirable that is so because lobbying 
activity is political speech that is at the core of the first 
amendment 
indeed during committee debate several panel members who voted 
for the legislation argued the new restrictions could violate the 
constitutional right to free speech and they said there was no 
evidence of wrongdoing by exlawmakersturnedlobbyists 
congress wrote the current set of antilobbying laws in the 
postwatergate 1978 ethics in government act lawmakers did not 
include themselves in the restrictions because they believed all 
the abuses were in the executive branch 
the judiciary committee added an amendment this week to include 
former presidents and vice presidents in the restrictions but it 
defeated a proposal to restrict former federal judges from 
appearing before their excolleagues for a year after leaving the 
bench 
under the house bill members of congress would be banned for a 
year from representing someone before any current member officer 
or employee of the house where they served the restriction would 
not apply to speeches or personal advice 
members former personal office staffers and excommittee 
staffers would be prohibited from contacting their exbosses and 
colleagues for the yearlong period 
the bill also would prevent former executive branch officers 
from even aiding and advising someone on particular matters 
they worked on in government the language is aimed at 
behindthescenes strategists who might direct lobbying efforts 
without actually making government contacts themselves 
in cases where the former officials had a policy or program 
under their official responsibility the bill also would 
prevent them from aiding or advising for two years after 
leaving government 
the former executive branch officials already are banned from 
representing clients directly before the government for that 
period 
the measure also would impose a oneyear ban on representing 
aiding and advising someone on a trade matter which was under the 
exemployees official responsibility or in which he participated 
personally in the last year of government service 
there also would be changes in restrictions and coverage for 
senior executive branch personnel who generally would face a 
oneyear coolingoff period before lobbying former colleagues and 
agencies 
the house bill also would add civil penalties for violating the 
lobbying law thus giving the justice department a new option 
against violators in cases where criminal penalties would not be 
pursued

cynthia gregory and fernando bujones two of 
americas most exciting ballet dancers are at the city center this 
week in a program called cynthia gregory amp fernando bujones 
together 
the week was almost sold out before it began by fans of miss 
gregory a los angeles native who celebrated 20 years with american 
ballet theater in 1985 and miamiborn bujones former member of 
american ballet theater followers of that company wish it would 
invite him to return 
the two dancers have tentative plans to tour early next year 
the evening on thursday began with a most charming ballet the 
rehearsal on a stage set to look like a rehearsal hall ian 
horvath formerly of ballet theater and now producing director of 
the jose limon dance foundation is directing a corps de ballet 
miss gregory and bujones do the lovers first meeting in 
giselle a kitchen scene from miss julie a duet from la 
sylphide dancing more and more excitingly they finish with a 
duet from don quixote in which her technique was diamond sharp 
and his dazzling dancing pushed up viewers blood pressure 
donald saddler created and staged the rehearsal and robert 
w larkin wrote it 
beloved memories was choreographed for four couples by 
francis patrelle it was meant to be exotic and turned out banal 
but the four couples danced marvelously concertino in two 
brief movements one showing a mood of anxiety and one of cheer 
was choreographed for miss gregory and bujones by lynne 
taylorcorbett 
the only dance not new for this engagement was the act 3 wedding 
from coppelia miss gregory had plenty of chances to balance on 
one toe standing as though that were easy and coming out of it 
with perfect grace she is a rarity a ballerina whose technique is 
crystal clear yet who conveys warmth she always had the clarity 
and has grown into the warmth 
bujones was exciting flying through the sky with bravura yet 
not looking like an egomaniac the last time miss gregory and 
bujones danced together before this week was in 1985 in 
coppelia

the state has filed a lawsuit against 
stores and manufacturers for allegedly failing to inform california 
consumers about cancercausing substances in tobacco products 
state attorney general john van de kamp said at a news 
conference friday that the lawsuit was filed in san francisco 
superior court against eight major retail chains 25 manufacturers 
of 200 brand named tobacco products and the ingredient 
communication council a manufacturers and retailers group 
the lawsuit filed in the first major enforcement under a state 
toxics warning law seeks civil penalties up to 2500 a day per 
violation and could reach millions if not hundreds of millions of 
dollars van de kamp said 
resolution of this landmark case should set standards and 
send out a warning for other products containing chemicals 
identified by state health authorities as known to cause cancer or 
birth defects van de kamp said 
the us surgeon general requires warnings about cancercausing 
risks on packages of cigarettes smokeless tobacco and chewing 
tobacco but cigars pipe tobacco and rollyourown tobacco require 
no federal warnings 
deputy attorney general edward weil said most stores named in 
the lawsuit recently began some form of warnings but investigators 
have to determine if they are adequate 
van de kamp said warnings on individual products probably would 
be easiest and most effective but many manufacturers dont want 
warnings on goods shipped outside california and cant control 
distribution to prevent that 
some tobacco manufacturers sent retailers warning signs after 
the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement act of 1986 was 
approved by voters weil said but stores didnt post them the law 
is commonly known as proposition 65 
most of the warning effort until recently was an 8by11inch 
flyer from the manufacturers group icc that is posted in stores 
the icc which includes 60 manufacturers retailers and 
agricultural producers provides the signs and maintains the 800 
number it was sued for allegedly misleading consumers and others 
into believing that the phone service provides a legally adequate 
warning 
the icc said that since february it has run newspaper 
advertisements and has 62000 signs in stores 
stores named in the lawsuit are safeway ralphs luckys alpha 
beta vons albertsons raleys and thrifty 
manufacturers include culbro corp general cigar consolidated 
cigar american tobacco brown amp williamson tobacco royal

the reagan administration has defied a 
congressional mandate by failing to make available surplus federal 
property to the homeless a federal judge has ruled 
on friday us district judge oliver gasch said the 
administrations interpretation of the 1987 mckinney act 
arbitrarily restricts the scope of the statute 
gasch said the law named after the late rep stewart b 
mckinney rconn who died a few months after it was enacted in 
1987 is designed to make surplus federal property available to 
assist the homeless 
agreeing with the national coalition for the homeless he said 
only 12 facilities have been identified as underused by federal 
agencies and only two have been made available to the homeless 
department of housing and urban development spokesman bob nipp 
said the decision will require the agency to review federal surveys 
of surplus buildings to determine which are suitable for housing 
hud general counsel j michael dorsey said he did not know how 
many properties would be involved he said the order however does 
not apply to singleunit dwellings taken over by hud or the 
veterans administration because of defaults on governmentbacked 
housing loans 
sales of hud houses will continue said dorsey who described the 
decision as generally positive because it could help identify 
additional buildings that might be used for the homeless 
the order directs us to do more in more detail than we thought 
we had done in substantial compliance with the law he said 
the decision said its unreasonable to suggest that congress 
chose to lease to the homeless halfempty properties and properties 
which are used part of the time but not properties which are 
wholly unoccupied 
gasch said the court is persuaded that the defendants are not 
properly implementing the law pitifully few of the numerous 
unused federal properties are being evaluated for their suitability 
to assist the homeless those that are found to be suitable are not 
being made available to homeless providers 
ms maria foscarinis who represented the homeless coalition 
called the ruling a terrific decision 
the judge clearly and strongly holds that the administration 
has been violating the law in not making available underused 
federal property to the homeless she said 
ms foscarinis said in a telephone interview from new york that 
the significance of the ruling is that tens of thousands of 
properties across the country can now be used to save lives 
she said the buildings now standing vacant or partially used 
include barracks on military bases veteran administration 
hospitals and post office buildings 
nine days ago gasch refused to bar the department of housing 
and urban development from selling singlefamily homes it had 
acquired through mortgage foreclosures to the highest bidder 
he issued an order denying a preliminary injunction requested by 
a coalition of advocates for the homeless who had sought to block 
hud from selling 47000 foreclosed houses in its inventory

indictments charging 27 pilots with 
concealing drug and alcoholrelated convictions are the first of 
hundreds expected from a nationwide investigation officials said 
twentyseven commercial private and student pilots were 
indicted friday accused of failing to reveal the convictions on 
medical certificates submitted to the federal aviation 
administration for their pilots license 
the indictments were the first in a nationwide crackdown on drug 
and alcohol abuse in the transportation industry federal 
authorities said 
the inspector generals office currently has investigations 
under way in all 50 states and hundreds of further such 
indictments are expected transportation secretary jim burnley 
said in washington 
twelve current or former commercial pilots were among those 
charged including a pilot with delta air lines who works as a 
second officer aboard an l1011 that pilot and a former pan 
american pilot were the only ones identified as employees of major 
passenger carriers 
a delta spokeswoman in atlanta said the pilot would be suspended 
once the airline is formally notified of the indictment 
all but three of the 27 are from florida 
us attorney robert genzman said authorities knew of no mishaps 
involving the individuals charged 
the pilotapplicants stated on their medical certificates they 
had no record of traffic or other convictions when in fact they had 
been convicted of drug or alcoholrelated offenses according to 
the indictment 
the convictions included drunken driving possession of 
marijuana and trafficking in cocaine 
investigators tracked down the pilots by matching computer files 
of the faa with those of motor vehicle departments and the fbi 
a conviction would not necessarily preclude a pilot from getting 
a medical certificate and pilots license said faa spokesman fred 
farrar 
but he said a past conviction would cause an faa medical 
examiner to look long and hard at the circumstances he may have 
concluded the pilot should not have a medical certificate 
burnley said the charges were indicative of the serious 
problem of drug and alcohol abuse which has permeated all walks of 
life and all professions in our society 
the charges grew out of a twoyear investigation that began with 
an audit of the national drivers registry to uncover alcohol or 
drugrelated traffic violations said ben lorigo of the 
transportation departments inspector generals office in 
washington 
the transportation department has proposed a broad range of drug 
tests including random tests of commercial airline pilots and 
other flight crew personnel 
if convicted the pilots could face at least five years in 
prison and fines ranging from 5000 to 250000

thomas reed a longtime state lawmaker and 
alabama naacp president says he wont give up his legislative seat 
despite his conviction for accepting 10000 to try to obtain early 
parole for a convicted murderer 
but attorney general don siegelman citing the alabama 
constitution and state law said reeds conviction disqualified him 
as a state representative and he must resign immediately 
im not necessarily shocked but i am disappointed reed 
said of the jurys verdict friday 
at a news conference the tuskegee democrat continued to blame 
his prosecution on his attempt to remove the confederate flag from 
atop the alabama capitol a move that drew national attention his 
trial was moved to mobile because of publicity about the case in 
montgomery 
you know and i know were it not for the confederate battle 
flag i probably would not be here today he said 
reed and 13 other black legislators await trial in state court 
in montgomery on misdemeanor trespassing charges stemming from 
their mostly symbolic bid to remove the flag from the capitol feb 
2 
that trial was postponed friday by district judge craig miller 
no new date was set 
the jury friday found reed guilty of extortion and of inducing a 
columbus ga businessman to travel to tuskegee ala to commit 
the crime 
reed 60 the alabama head of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people as well as the senior black in the 
state legislature was found innocent on three remaining charges 
including accepting restaurant equipment from the businessman 
bobby gene chesser as a bribe in the 1986 bid to free chessers 
nephew 
the nephew anthony dennis chesser is serving a 40year 
sentence for killing his wife four years ago his bid to seek early 
parole failed 
us district judge joel dubina did not immediately set a 
sentencing date 
reed who shook hands with the judge before leaving could 
receive a maximum of 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine on the 
extortion count and a fiveyear term and a 250000 fine on the 
lesser charge 
naacp executive director benjamin l hooks declined to comment 
on the verdict but he described reed as a positive force in the 
area of civil rights for a number of years and we respect his 
service 
reed who in 1970 became one of the first two blacks elected to 
the alabama legislature this century said by no means would he 
vacate his seat in the state house of representatives 
vowing to appeal defense attorney bill baxley a former state 
attorney general and exlieutenant governor said his opinion was 
that reeds removal would be up to the house 
but in a letter dated friday to reed siegelman wrote that reed 
must leave office immediately or siegelman would take legal action 
to have him removed 
siegelman said reed would be restored to office if his 
conviction was reversed

eastern airlines unions say their fight to save 
3000 jobs isnt over even though a federal appeals panel ruled the 
financially troubled carrier had ample reason for these 
reductions 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington approved the job cuts friday and rejected union 
contentions that eastern management was illegally undercutting the 
bargaining power of its pilots flight attendants and machinists 
unions 
the court said the layoffs resulting from service cuts to 14 
cities were a legitimate effort to staunch losses which eastern 
estimated at 1 million a day during this years second quarter 
since 1980 the miamibased carrier has lost 1 billion and blames 
much of its troubles on its unions 
the unions have directed our attention to nothing that would 
undermine easterns claim that legitimate business concerns provide 
an ample reason for these reductions judge stephen williams 
wrote for the unanimous panel 
us district judge barrington d parker erred in granting the 
unions an injunction last month to halt the layoffs because the 
dispute between the texas air corp subsidiary and its unions was 
minor under federal labor law williams wrote 
it was certainly disappointing it didnt come as a shock we 
knew or i had the impression this was a conservative panel but 
we had faith in judge parkers ruling said charles bryan head 
of miamis machinists union local which represents about 9500 
mechanics and ground workers 
what our options are right now is to ask for a full review by 
the 11member panel of the appeals court we can do that or have 
remanded it back to judge parker for full trial bryan said 
the air line pilots association will ask for a hearing by the 
full appeals court said union spokesman ron cole in florida 
the transport workers union representing about 6700 flight 
attendants was unsure what action it would take said nancy 
currier vice president of the miami local 
eastern lawyer michael madigan in washington said we regard 
this as an enormously significant ruling for eastern and for the 
airline industry as a whole 
eastern in july announced plans to sell planes cut unprofitable 
routes close its kansas city hub and lay off 4000 workers on aug 
31 job cuts included management union and nonunion workers 
because some workers quit retired or took unpaid leaves about 
3000 were laid off 
the carrier is banking on savings of up to 120 million from 
service cuts and of slicing 7 million monthly from its payroll 
the unions quickly challenged the plan which they viewed as a 
ploy by easterns parent to dismantle the company and hurt 
organized labor since texas air bought eastern in 1986 easterns 
work force has shrunk from about 42000 to 30000 
meanwhile in cambridge mass eastern workers gathered friday 
on the banks of the charles river to protest what they characterize 
as the unionbusting tactics of texas air chairman frank lorenzo 
whose harvard business school class was holding its 25th 
anniversary this weekend 
the rev jesse jackson canceled a speech at memphis state 
university to address the rally which was within earshot of the 
building where lorenzos classmates were gathering a harvard 
official said however that lorenzo was not present

endorsement from police unions bush also visited new jersey and 
connecticut 
both vice presidential nominees democrat lloyd bentsen and 
republican dan quayle began a weekend of intensive preparation 
for their debate wednesday in omaha neb 
reagan took the campaign to chicago a democratic stronghold 
that bush bypassed earlier in the week during a bus tour of small 
towns in central and northern illinois 
besides attending fundraisers reagan courted 
conservativeminded democrats and independent voters in ethnic 
communities many of whose votes helped reagan and bush carry the 
state in the last two elections 
the liberals may try to mouth some of our words but when they 
talk about values and family they mean something very 
different he told an audience of 1500 in a polish social hall 
dukakis california sojourn included a trip to the stringfellow 
acid pits one of the most notorious toxic waste sites in the 
country 
dukakis who has been criticized for being too slow to attack 
the pollution problem in boston harbor called a recently initiated 
cleanup one of the finer achievements of his administration and 
the largest single water cleanup project in america 
he said his states toxic waste cleanup program has cleaned up 
nearly 300 sites and is working on another 400 the current 
administration has completed about 25 or 30 he said 
in idalou texas dukakis pledged to set aside a 100 million 
fund to rebuild america for business financing in rural 
communities he also pointed to his proposals for improving rural 
health care and increasing education aid

said theyve been selling off our farms and businesses and banks 
and real estate to foreign investors 
campaigning in massachusetts new jersey and connecticut bush 
found police organizations ready to take up his cause his attacks 
on the american civil liberties union were echoed by passaic 
county nj sheriff edwin englehardt 
police dont want a man in that white house who is a 
sympathizer and a cardcarrying member of the aclu that great 
organization thats against everything thats right for america 
englehardt said 
in springfield mass where he collected the endorsement of 
police unions bush suggested dukakis was trying to conceal his own 
record i am running as myself and my opponent is running from 
himself 
quayle who campaigned briefly in philadelphia on friday was 
going to conduct a formal mock debate today with sen bob packwod 
rore who is standing in for bentsen 
bentsen accepting the national education associations

panelists were chosen for wednesdays vice presidential 
debate judy woodruff of the macneillehrer newshour will be 
moderator the panelists are jon margolis of the chicago tribune 
britt hume of abc and tom brokaw of nbc 
a gallup survey of 1020 registered voters indicated bush was 
the choice of 47 percent dukakis 42 percent the survey conducted 
tuesday and wednesday had a 3 point margin of error a los angeles 
times poll conducted by calling back voters who had been 
interviewed just before and then just after the sundays 
presidential debate found the race still a tie at 4545 the new 
callback poll conducted thursday had 622 respondents and a 
5point margin of error 
the seattle times which has endorsed only republican 
presidential candidates since 1920 endorsed michael dukakis the 
endorsement will appear in an editorial sunday 
bush spokesman steve hart disputed as absolutely untrue a 
contention by former central intelligence agency director 
stansfield turner that bush had rehired panamanian military leader 
manual antonio noriega as a cia source turner said friday in 
interviews with several news organizations that he dismissed 
noriega in 1976 because he was an unscrupulous character 
dukakis has criticized the administration for its support of 
noriega until just recently bush said in sundays debate that 
seven administrations had dealt with the military leader who is 
under a drug indictment in the united states 
the dukakis campaign began airing a 30second advertising spot 
during friday nights olympic coverage called the packaging of 
george bush the ad carries the message that bush is using the 
patriotism issue because he has no programs or proposals for 
middleclass americans

the nations three major tv networks say they 
will join an advertising campaign urging sexually active americans 
to use condoms to prevent the spread of aids 
the commercials direct and fraught with emotion were released 
friday by the nations leading producer of publicservice 
announcements the advertising council 
several national publications also said they would run print 
versions 
the public service campaign of the advertising council may 
offend some people im truly sorry about that said us surgeon 
general c everett koop who endorsed the campaign at a manhattan 
news conference you cannot ignore people who might not have your 
own morality 
critics of the ads called them misleading because condoms are 
not foolproof 
people will use condoms feel protected and still get aids 
and die said dr elizabeth whelan executive director of the 
american council on science and health 
there is no such thing as safe sex when it comes to aids 
said monsignor john woolsey director of the office of christian 
and family development for the archdiocese of new york recent 
studies indicate that the failure rate for condoms is overwhelming 
perhaps as high as 40 percent there is only one sure way to 
prevent aids abstinence 
but koop called abstinence not a viable option for most 
people he said many people also are not monogamous 
though aids has not spread among heterosexuals nearly as rapidly 
as it swept the homosexual population he said it can be spread 
through heterosexual sex 
the television spots include one in which a youth standing in a 
rainstorm says my brother wouldnt listen to me i told him 
you have sex you use condoms so you dont get aids he laughed 
and said condoms werent macho 
the youth then crumples to a sitting position and the camera 
shows that he is in a cemetery my brother he says he was 
so macho 
the print ads are equally direct one simply carries a photo of 
a rolled condom the legend says using it wont kill you not 
using it might 
abc and nbc ran similar messages last year although cbs did not 
a lot has happened since that time theres a national 
awareness and we want to be part of the awareness program said 
cbs spokesman george schweitzer 
he said cbs would air two of the spots only after 9 pm abc 
did not set a time restriction nbc had no formal restriction but 
said the spots were unlikely to appear before 9 pm 
although ad campaigns have urged the use of condoms before the 
new effort carries added clout through the participation of the 
advertising council which has produced several highly successful 
public service campaigns such as the take a bite out of crime 
promotion 
the council sponsored by the advertising and communications 
industries distributes its publicservice ads to media outlets for 
use at their discretion

the swelling ranks of minorities in the work place 
and an aging work force will make affirmative action a business 
necessity in the next decade labor secretary anne mclaughlin 
says 
affirmative action is no longer just a matter of social 
responsibility its not just a matter of legal compulsion she 
said friday in the future the market will make it a fact of 
life 
in a speech to a conference of industrial human services 
specialists she said 
i take seriously our responsibility at the department to 
assure that equal opportunity has real meaning and that we as a 
nation and more particularly as a government lead by example 
labor department studies point to a challenge for business in 
the decade ahead she said 
the rate of new workers entering the labor market is expected to 
be the lowest since world war ii and the average age of workers is 
expected to rise from 36 to 39 
nearly twothirds of those entering the job market between now 
and the year 2000 will be women she said and more immigrants will 
be in the work force than any time since world war ii 
the next challenge for business will be the quiet revolution 
ushered in by a new work force increasingly composed of women 
minorities the disabled and older workers she said 
affirmative action will play a central role she said not 
merely the traditional social or altruistic perspective of 
affirmative action she said but affirmative action as it has 
evolved as a business necessity 
mclaughlin said those efforts must be aimed at preparing the 
work force for the jobs now being created investing in public 
education and adjusting to the child care and other demands of the 
new work force 
the onus is on the private sector she said adding federal 
solutions to local problems are in nobodys best interest 
if corporate america doesnt take the lead in developing 
talent now she said it will pay more for talent later

the director of the american civil liberties 
union had criticism for both vice president george bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
ira glasser the aclus national director told the cleveland 
city club on friday that bush made inaccurate statements about the 
aclu in sundays presidential debate glasser criticized dukakis 
for taking the easy way out in defending his stance on the pledge 
of allegiance 
dukakis vetoed a 1977 bill that would have required 
massachusetts public school teachers to lead students in the pledge 
daily he cited an advisory opinion from the massachusetts supreme 
court for his veto 
i think the bush people and the dukakis people are taking the 
same strategy said glasser its too hard to explain 
glasser said bush is pushing for the pledge requirement because 
it is a good campaign issue despite its unconstitutionality while 
dukakis is ignoring the issue because of its complexity

the story of a former state senator reads 
like a hollywood script a dramatically staged drowning a twoyear 
manhunt spanning four continents and tales of torture in an island 
jail 
and just as his flight began three years ago on labor day when 
he faked his own scubadiving death to avoid prosecution david 
friedland ended the tale in much the same dramatic way 
in a surprise move four days after testimony began in federal 
court in camden in his pensionfund fraud trial friedland abruptly 
ended his trial thursday by pleading guilty to one count of 
racketeering 
a 47count indictment charged the 50yearold friedland with 
heading a scheme to defraud 20 million from the pension fund of 
teamsters local 701 in north brunswick 
i want to get this episode of my life over with friedland 
said after his guilty plea i want to look ahead not at the 
past 
two weeks earlier during jury selection a relaxed and smiling 
friedland said he was looking forward to the trial and exonerating 
himself three codefendants already had been convicted in the case 
as they say the truth will set you free friedland said 
at the time 
defense attorneys said they were battling unbeatable odds in the 
case which included an 11page statement that friedland gave to a 
federal agent after his capture in the maldive islands in the 
indian ocean 
there was also the testimony of joseph j higgins friedlands 
former partner in a bogus mortgage company set up in florida to 
skim money from the pension fund 
in return for the guilty plea prosecutors said they dropped 
remaining charges against friedland including perjury mail and 
wire fraud and violating the employee retirement income act 
the plea bargain includes a provision not to prosecute friedland 
for his global flight said john yacovelle one of friedlands 
attorneys 
yacovelle said defense attorneys had been negotiating with the 
government for several months to reach an agreement 
friedland faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison when he 
is sentenced oct 28 before chief us district judge john f gerry 
federal authorities say friedland a flamboyant disbarred 
lawyer staged a fake drowning in the bahamas on labor day 1985 
just before he was indicted along with the two union pension fund 
trustees and the funds lawyer 
his disappearance also came three weeks before a hearing on his 
request for a reduction of a sevenyear prison sentence for a 1980 
conviction of taking 360000 for arranging a 4 million loan from 
the same pension fund friedland is serving that sentence at mercer 
county jail in trenton 
friedland spent 26 months in africa asia and europe before his 
arrest dec 12 in the maldives while in the islands prosecutors 
say friedland ran five scuba diving shops under the name richard 
harley 
during the return flight to the united states friedland gave a 
detailed statement to a federal agent he later attempted to 
suppress that statement saying he was thinking unclearly because 
of conditions of his confinement while he was held by maldivian 
authorities coupled with the effects of medication he was taking 
friedland said that whenever he tried to sleep his jailers 
awakened him by smashing a stick against his bunk 
friedland said he became so desperate to remain on the islands 
that he contacted libyan leader moammar gadhafi asking for 
sanctuary at one point he said he saw a vision of a hooded 
figure the prophet mohammed beckoning him to convert to the 
islamic faith 
i began to believe mohammed was the prophet of god 
friedland testified i heard a voice say god is now

doctors errors led to as many as onequarter 
of the deaths of patients being treated for heart ailments strokes 
and pneumonia in 12 hospitals studied by the rand corp 
but the researchers cautioned against assuming the results apply 
to all of the nations hospitals 
physicians improperly treated patients complaining of chest 
pains prescribed the wrong kind of antibiotics for pneumonia and 
misdiagnosed strokes according to the study published in todays 
edition of the annals of internal medicine 
the study noted that the findings are preliminary and that the 
errors were common and relatively easy to correct 
a hospitals quality assurance committee should approach these 
findings with a certain sense of optimism the study said 
although these probably preventable deaths occurred with what we 
consider surprising frequency they were due to a small number of 
causes 
all three of the physicianpanelists who reviewed the 12 
hospitals records agreed that 14 percent of the deaths probably 
could have been prevented two of the three agreed that 27 percent 
of the deaths were probably preventable the study said 
dr robert w dubois who headed the study said hospital 
patients should not be alarmed 
the overwhelming majority over 95 percent of the people 
admitted to a hospital dont die this is a nonissue for them 
he said so its important to put this in perspective of the 
onequarter to onesixth of those who do die their death was 
probably preventable 
the study by the rand corp a santa monicabased think tank 
was based on a review of 182 patients who died in 1985 at hospitals 
owned by american medical international of beverly hills a chain 
of 115 hospitals in the united states and abroad 
ami sponsored the study and made extensive changes in its 
quality control program based on findings that were privately 
released a spokesman said 
ami spokesman mick taylor said the study should send warning 
signals to other hosptials 
it suggests there still remains a need for control mechanisms 
that very precisely define what quality is and then very closely 
monitor every activity within a hospital that impacts a patient 
taylor said 
the study found that the average patient whose death might have 
been prevented was between ages 75 and 79 and suffered less severe 
illnesses than those whose deaths were unavoidable 
the deaths of 23 heart attack patients probably could have been 
prevented had doctors not made errors in treatment the majority of 
panelists said 
for instance the study found that a number of patients received 
either no treatment or only single doses of nitroglycerine or 
morphine after complaining of chest pains 
the study suggested that doctors should have been more 
aggressive in the treatment intervening with drugs or surgery to 
avert what would be fatal heart attacks 
errors in diagnosis were the main cause of nine deaths from 
strokes the majority of panelists found in some cases doctors 
failed to administer such diagnostic procedures as a spinal tap and 
blood cultures 
the majority of panelists also found that errors in both 
diagnosis and treatment led to 17 deaths from pneumonia

a jury at an inquest ruled that the killings of 
three unarmed ira members by british commandos in march were legal 
foreman daniel gabay said the 11member panel voted 92 on 
friday for the lawful killing verdicts 
commandos of the british special air service or sas regiment 
shot the three on march 6 as they walked in this british colony 
toward the spanish border the victims were daniel mccann 30 sean 
savage 24 and mairead farrell 31 
the commandos testified they believed the irish republican army 
members were prepared to detonate a car bomb by remote control and 
made threatening moves when confronted 
the outlawed ira has acknowledged the three were group members 
on active service meaning they were on a mission to strike 
against a british target at the time of their deaths 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
have claimed the killings were part of an unofficial 
shoottokill policy against members of the ira which seeks 
independence for northern ireland and union with the republic of 
ireland 
this is a pyrrhic victory for the crown counsel there was a 
split decision said niall farrell brother of ms farrell in 
gibraltar after announcement of the jurys verdict 
weve seen the evidence sean was shot on the ground mairead 
and dan were shot in the back while lying on the ground 
the inquest headed by coroner felix pizzarello had no power of 
prosecution its sole aim was to determine whether the shootings 
were lawful a verdict of unlawful killing could have led to 
criminal indictments 
britain welcomed the decision 
to fight terrorism and to protect innocent lives the use of 
force by the security forces is regrettably sometimes 
unavoidable said a defense ministry official in london speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british practice 
such action must at all times be within the law this 
principle was fully upheld the official added 
in dublin a government statement said irish prime minister 
charles haughey and his cabinet would review the verdicts in detail 
before commenting 
niall farrell calling the commandos a bunch of murderers 
and the verdict a travesty of justice asked haughey to pursue 
the case in the european court of human rights in strasbourg 
france 
in his summation pizzarello asked the jury to reach a unanimous 
verdict either for justifiable homicide or unlawful killing he 
later said a split decision was acceptable 
i dont see it as a victory or anything else crown counsel 
john laws told reporters weve had a good judicial inquiry 
according to british law applied to gibraltar and thats all there 
is to it 
after the three were killed they were found to be unarmed and 
the car savage had parked was found not to contain any explosives 
or timing devices 
two days later spanish police found a car packed with 
explosives in marbella 48 miles away the car had been rented to 
one of the dead

patients with kidneys impaired by high 
blood pressure may halt kidney deterioration and even see 
improvements with stricter control of blood pressure levels 
research suggests 
the discovery which contradicts some research on animals that 
indicated kidney disease is unstoppable once damage has occurred 
was announced friday by william pettinger professor of internal 
medicine and director of the midwest hypertension research 
institute at creighton university school of medicine 
the finding suggests that conventional drugs could be used more 
aggressively to control blood pressure and protect kidneys 
nearly 60 million americans face a much higher risk of stroke or 
heart attack because they suffer from high blood pressure kidney 
damage is a direct result of the affliction pettinger said 
although not all hypertension patients suffer impaired kidney 
functioning 
joseph izzo associate professor of medicine and pharmacology at 
the state university of new york at buffalo said pettingers 
research underscores previous findings 
you have to consider it significant and its in light of a 
longstanding body of information that pressure accelerates 
damage to the kidneys said izzo since we can control 
pressure we ought to 
damaged kidneys are less able to filter impurities from the 
blood allowing substances that are normally excreted to build up 
including urea 
aggressive control of blood pressure not only protects kidney 
function but you actually get some return of function said 
pettinger who reported his findings at a conference of the 
american heart associations council for high blood pressure 
research 
weve been able to conserve kidney function in the vast 
majority of patients even those who started with 50 to 75 percent 
kidney damage he said 
pettinger said he will continue to research an apparent 
correlation between improved kidney function and reduced intake of 
drugs to treat high blood pressure 
with constant good control of blood pressure the mechanisms 
which sustain high blood pressure appear to be reduced and a 
smaller amount of drugs are required to control the blood 
pressure he said 
pettingers study involved 18 patients who were treated with 
conventional drugs for high blood pressure 
in a second announcement friday researchers at the university 
of california at san francisco revealed that two tests may help 
detect coronary artery disease in patients with mild high blood 
pressure before symptoms develop 
coronary artery disease is caused by fat that builds up in the 
walls of blood vessels in the three main arteries of the heart it 
often goes undetected until a patient suffers a heart attack pain 
or sudden death onethird of sufferers die suddenly without any 
warning of the condition 
brian okelly a cardiology research fellow at ucsf and a 
clinical fellow at the albert heritage foundation for medical 
research in alberta canada reported preliminary findings that 
suggest two tests used to diagnose heart disease may prove useful 
in early detection of silent coronary artery disease 
patients with mild high blood pressure are more likely to suffer 
from arterial blockage than those with normal blood pressure 
although researchers are not sure what the relationship is said 
okelly 
until now treatment of high blood pressure has successfully 
reduced the incidence of strokes kidney failure and heart failure 
he said but it has failed to reduce the incidence of fatal heart 
attacks and hardening of the arteries 
researchers theorize the reason is that the disease is present 
before treatment begins 
okelly hopes the tests will help identify people at high risk 
of developing symptomatic heart disease in time to begin aggressive 
treatment successful early detection could also help develop more 
effective ways to avoid heart attacks he said

vice president george bush reinstated 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega as a paid intelligence 
source after he was dropped by the central intelligence agency 
according to former cia director stansfield turner 
the allegation by turner were termed as absolutely untrue 
friday by a bush spokesman 
the vice president in his recent debate with democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis suggested it was unfair to 
blame only the reagan administration for us links with noriega 
because he said seven adminstrations had condoned such ties 
noriega this year was indicted in miami on drug charges 
turner who was head of the cia in the carter administration 
said friday he removed noriega as a paid intelligence source in 
1976 but when the reagan adminstration took over bush in l981 met 
with noriega and put him back on the payroll 
bush spokesman steve hart said that as vice president bush had 
only one meeting that noriega attended and that was in 1983 when 
bush was also meeting with the panamanian president and other 
officials 
turner in interviews with cbs nbc and other news organizations 
said he severed the cias ties with noriega because the panamanian 
leader was an unscrupulous character 
dukakis has made a campaign issue of the reagan administrations 
support of noriega the de facto ruler of panama saying in 
sundays debate weve been dealing with him hes been dealing 
drugs to our kids 
bush replied that the administration moved swiftly to indict 
noriega as soon as it had evidence 
efforts by the associated press to reach turner at his phoenix 
hotel room and at his washington residence were unsuccessful 
according to the washington post the dukakis campaign was 
encouraging news organizations to call turner about noriega and 
supplied the phoenix number

an empty innertube raft a knapsack and 
watersoaked notes are all that remain of a doomed effort by four 
young cubans who tried to flee their homeland immigration 
officials said 
the apparent deaths of the four youths who left cuba on sept 6 
just as hurricane gilbert was about to strike spotlights the 
dangers of such freedom floats said perry rivkind district 
director of the us immigration and naturalization service 
well over 50 percent of them never make it to the united 
states rivkind said friday but they keep on coming its an 
indication of how desperate the situation is 
rivkind said 26 people have successfully negotiated the florida 
straits on innertube rafts in the past year it is 90 miles from 
the cuban coast to key west but ocean currents generally carry 
rafts much farther it is about 200 miles to miami and survivors 
have been picked up farther north 
rivkind is certain many others did not make it but this is one 
of the few times a raft has been found and relatives could confirm 
who was aboard in most cases relatives are afraid to report the 
disappearances to cuban authorities rivkind said 
the canvascovered raft of lashedtogether inner tubes was found 
monday by a us coast guard patrol 60 miles southeast of miami 
on board were the records of luis mourelocoll 19 a lovesick 
cuban soldier who deserted the military to try to rejoin his 
girlfriend who had arrived in miami in august mourelocoll also 
had relatives in florida 
at first it was thought he might have been alone on the raft 
but on friday tearful relatives of three others aboard contacted 
the ins rivkind said he could not release names but that they were 
14 16 and 25 years old 
mourelocolls flight had been carefully planned inside a 
knapsack found with the raft were his cuban identification 
military and junior high school records and five passportsize 
photos 
also in the bag were unlabeled food cans a tire pump 
antihistamine a cuban cigar coins a comb and a membership card 
for a resort in spain there was also a list of names and addresses 
in florida along with some notes that became illegible in the 
water 
the coast guard estimates hurricane gilbert must have struck the 
raft with 40 to 50mph winds after the four had been floating for 
six to seven days 
you can just picture this thing bouncing upside down in the 
storm rivkind said there is no way they could have survived 
it 
carmen rodriguez a cousin raised with mourelocolls mother 
had readied a spare room here after hearing in a sept 8 phone call 
that her cousin had left cuba but she spoke to mourelocolls 
grandmother in cuba on wednesday and learned that no one has heard 
from him since he left 
rivkind said he will ask radio marti the floridabased radio 
station beamed to cuba to issue more warnings about freedom floats

army troops in full combat gear moved 
into two southern cities today to quell ethnic gun battles that 
killed about 175 people and wounded at least 170 others officials 
said 
the violence started friday night in hyderabad 100 miles 
northeast of karachi when marauding bands of native sindhis 
sprayed gunfire in about 30 neighborhoods of mohajirs indian 
moslems who migrated to pakistan after partition in 1947 witnesses 
said 
on hearing the news mohajirs in karachi retaliated by setting 
up roadblocks and firing on vehicles traveling from sindhi 
neighborhoods 
in one case mohajir gunmen sprayed gunfire through the windows 
and doors of a bus carrying sindhi fish merchants killing 12 of 
about 20 on board a witness said 
hospitals in hyderabad said about 149 people mostly mohajirs 
were killed and 170 were wounded karachi hospitals confirmed a 
total of 26 dead mostly sindhis 
ali hassan a local resident of hyderabad who saw the violence 
told the associated press by telephone it was hell 
the markets were full of people when bullets were sprayed 
from a moving car there was panic and people started running for 
shelter he said 
he said 10 to 15 cars and jeeps opened fire in about 30 
different parts of the city at the same time 
hassan said the targets included public gatherings a wedding 
movie houses and bus stops 
he said sirens wailed as ambulances raced through the streets 
ferrying the dead and wounded to hospitals 
it was a very wellplanned attack and executed with 
perfection hassan said 
ismail baloch a 50year fish merchant and wounded survivor of 
the karachi bus attack said he and about 19 other sindhis were 
riding from their village east of the city to the main harbor when 
armed mohajirs stopped their bus near karachi airport 
they just started firing through windows and doors he said 
from his bed at the citys jinnah hospital 
authorities responded in both cities by calling in army troops 
with machinegun mounted jeeps and armored personnel carriers 
police clamped an indefinite curfew on hyderabad and calm was 
reported restored by this morning as military patrolled the streets 
in karachi officials put a curfew on six neighborhoods today 
but sporadic gunfire and rockthrowing were still being reported 
both hyderabad and karachi have been the scene of bloody ethnic 
clashes in the past between mojajirs and separaists who want sind 
province to be independent of pakistan 
most of the dead in hyderabad were mohajirs and casualties in 
karachi were sindhi 
the hyderabad massacre was the worst in history for the city of 
one million 
the highest death toll ever reported in hyderabad was 18 in 
riots last july that followed an unsuccessful attempt by sindhi 
student radicals to assassinate mohajir mayor aftab sheikh 
mohajirs later published a list of alleged suspects including 
the president and six office bearers of the jeay long live sind 
students federation all seven eventually were arrested and face 
trial on murder and related charges 
police speaking on condition of anonymity said friday nights 
attacks appeared to be the sindhis answer to those arrests 
the most militant sindhis are members of the jeay sindhi 
movement which is campaigning for an independent state of 
sindhudesh 
the mohajirs who dominate the provinces cities have formed 
the mohajir quami movement to press for official recognition as a 
fifth nationality in addition to the sindhis punjabis baluchis 
and pathans 
karachi a hot dusty metropolis of eight million has a long 
history of ethnic unrest which peaked with sindhipathan clashes in 
late 1986 that killed more than 200

city officials have decided to make 
permanent a law requiring 24hour convenience stores to have at 
least two clerks at night after police found the measure reduced 
robberies 
city commissioners voted 31 thursday night to draft a permanent 
ordinance that will be virtually identical to the 2yearold 
experimental ordinance that expires nov 11 
the measure requires allnight convenience stores to have at 
least two clerks on duty between 8 pm and 4 am it also requires 
stores to install security cameras and to keep windows clear of 
advertisements 
police chief wayland clifton claimed the twoclerk requirement 
was a major reason why convenience store robberies in the city 
dropped from 61 in 1986 to 23 last year and eight so far this year 
theres a lot less danger out there for people who work at 
them and who go there to buy bread and milk he said 
but gerald felder a lawyer representing the retail grocers 
association argued that the twoclerk law was too expensive 
costing stores 18000 to 25000 a year that expense may have 
been a factor in the closing of five convenience stores he said 
the problem is the economic burden and the reasonableness of 
the twoclerk requirement felder said the idea is to make the 
stores safer but what youre doing is doubling the number of 
potential victims he said 
felder said robberies dropped after 1986 largely because of the 
arrest of one or two active thieves and the effectiveness of other 
requirements in the ordinance

attica correctional facility inmates have 
no claim against nelson rockefellers estate for deaths that 
occurred during a violent prison uprising in 1971 a federal judge 
has ruled 
a former state corrections commissioner former state police 
officials and new york national guard officials remain defendants 
in the 2 billion lawsuit 
although rockefeller then governor gave state police the 
goahead to retake the prison from rebelling inmates on sept 13 
1971 he cant be held legally responsible for the 39 deaths that 
resulted us district judge john elfvin said friday 
rockefeller had no personal involvement in unlawful or 
indiscriminate use of force elfvin found there is no question 
regarding his role and its legality 
attorneys representing 1281 attica inmates filed the lawsuit 14 
years ago they can appeal the ruling to the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals 
elfvins ruling is seen as a major disappointment to the inmates 
because none of the other defendants approach rockefellers wealth 
the ruling is a victory for rockefellers heirs who have been 
prevented by the suit from inheriting an estate worth more than 
665 million the former vice president and governor died of a 
heart attack in 1979 
elizabeth fink lead attorney for the inmates was out of her 
brooklyn office and unavailable for comment her secretary said 
twentynine attica prisoners and 10 people taken hostage by the 
inmates were killed when authorities stormed the western new york 
prison five days after an inmate revolt 
elfvin pointed out that he was only ruling on rockefellers 
involvement in the retaking of the prison and not on the question 
of whether improper force was used 
after negotiations broke down rockefeller gave permission for 
police to storm the prison but to use firearms only if their lives 
or the lives of hostages were endangered other than that 
rockefeller had no actual role in the planning of the assault 
elfvin said

president reagan and congress have approved a 
defense budget which essentially freezes spending for a fourth 
straight year and leaves the next president the task of trying to 
forge a consensus on star wars and new landbased nuclear missiles 
congress late friday gave voicevote approval to a bill 
appropriating most of the pentagon budget authorized in separate 
legislation passed earlier in the week 
that authorization measure was signed friday by reagan who had 
vetoed a slightly different spending plan seven weeks ago because 
he said it had too many restrictions on his pentagon programs 
the pentagon budget calls for 300 billion in the fiscal year 
which began today that is a fourth consecutive year of either 
freezing or slightly reducing the defense budget following four 
years of large increases during reagans first term 
americas 21 million uniformed military personnel will receive 
a 41 percent pay increase in the budget 
the bills give 41 billion to reagans star wars antimissile 
plan known formally as the strategic defense initiative last 
years sdi budget was 39 billion and reagan wanted 48 billion 
the final bill stripped out democraticwritten restrictions that 
would have limited pentagon plans to develop an earlystage sdi 
system for deployment in the next decade those limits were one of 
the reasons reagan vetoed the earlier legislation 
the future of the fiveyearold program will depend in part on 
the nov 8 presidential election vice president george bush is a 
star wars backer but his democratic opponent michael dukakis has 
proposed cutting sdi back to a research program of about 1 billion 
a year 
the bills also leave it to the next administration to answer the 
question of what to do about a successor to the minuteman missile 
as the heart of americas landbased nuclear deterent 
the measure provides 250 million each for the singlewarhead 
midgetman and a railroadbased version of the mx missile plus an 
additional 350 million for the mx that cant be spent until after 
feb 15 the new president could seek a reallocation of that latter 
total if he chooses 
the administration has won approval for 50 of the 10warhead mx 
weapons based in ground silos and is pushing for 50 more to be 
put aboard trains congressional democrats generally have favored 
the smaller midgetman 
the bills also include 320 million to increase the military 
role in the antidrug effort and order the defense department ot 
provide more intelligence and tracking information to civilian law

trust youve granted me in the past and now i have very deep 
respect for it 
he became president in july 1985 after 28 years as foreign 
minister 
fridays central committee meeting also approved wideranging 
changes in the party bureaucracy destined to increase gorbachevs 
powers 
moscow communist party leader lev n zaikov said gorbachev 
was endorsed by the presidium of the supreme soviet and by the 
central committee 
in an earlier report on the supreme soviets meeting tass the 
official soviet news agency said a few personnel questions 
were on the agenda 
on friday gorbachev also obtained the resignations of three 
brezhnevera holdovers full politburo member mikhail s 
solomentsev and candidate members demichev and vladimir dolgikh 
he streamlined the apparatus and put staunch supporters in key 
positions in the party which exercises sole control over the 
subordinate government bureaucracy 
the decision to cut the number of government departments from 
about 20 to six means hundreds perhaps thousands of the soviet 
unions top party bureaucrats will lose their jobs 
in other moves yegor k ligachev considered the kremlins no 
2 leader apparently was demoted in taking on the central 
committees agriculture portfolio a member of the ruling politburo 
who earlier had been replaced as communist party chief for 
ideology ligachev had widely been seen as a potential conservative 
rival to the soviet leader 
anatoly f dobrynin 68 who served as ambassador to the united 
states for 24 years before returning to moscow to oversee foreign 
relations in the central committee retired as secretary of that 
body 
this weeks meetings in moscow were called so hastily that they 
forced several kremlin leaders to cut short trips abroad and gave 
rise to speculation that gorbachev might be trying to head off 
opposition to his broad program of social and economic reforms 
a senior soviet political analyst said the changes clearly 
strengthened gorbachevs hand and would reduce tensions among 
soviet leaders 
one new member was named friday to the politburo vadim a 
medvedev medvedev who was named to the central committee two 
years ago vaulted over nonvoting politburo status to become a 
full member 
medvedev took over responsibility for ideology in the central 
committee gorbachev adviser alexander n yakovlev was assigned to 
international policy and nikolai slyunkov was given responsibility 
for economic and social policy 
ligachev was transferred to overseeing agricultural policy an 
area of immense importance to the soviet economy however that 
position narrows his base in the communist party

negotiators for deere amp co and the united 
auto workers reached a tentative agreement today on a threeyear 
contract affecting more than 13400 workers company and union 
spokesmen said 
robert combs spokesman for the farm equipment manufacturer 
announced the settlement shortly after 5 am cdt when pickets had 
already been posted in front of some plants no details of the pact 
were immediately released 
talks between the two sides had continued in moline ill past 
the unions midnight friday strike deadline 
the agreement covers employees at plants in atlanta 
minneapolis denver and smaller towns in illinois and iowa combs 
said 
uaw spokesman karl mantyla confirmed that the agreement had been 
reached but said he could not comment on details 
its subject to some ironing out of language said mantyla 
after approximately 20 hours of talks he said a schedule for a 
ratification vote likely would be decided on during the weekend 
although pickets were reported after midnight at some deere 
plants mantyla said no strike had been called 
no instructions were issued from here to walk out but we have 
not advised them not to either we dont know what the local 
unions are doing he said 
bruce davis a spokesman for uaw local 94 said a strike over 
local issues continues this morning at the dubuque deere plant 
despite the tentative agreement on a companywide contract he would 
not elaborate on the issues 
the 5377 workers at deeres largest plant in waterloo iowa 
delayed any strike action said jerry niedert first vice president 
of the union local in waterloo 
the tentative agreement apparently averts a fullscale walkout 
like the bitter strike in 198687 that ended after 163 days with 
employees acceptance of a wage freeze and other concessions 
in bridgeton mo negotiators for caterpillar inc and the uaw 
agreed earlier friday to extend their contract indefinitely 
averting a midnight strike deadline and allowing the union to focus 
its attention on deere 
the extension agreement between peoriabased caterpillar and the 
uaw came just 12 hours before the current contract would have 
expired and avoided a possible walkout by 17500 caterpillar 
workers in five states

for the worse today when he lost a large amount of blood and 
suffered a sharp drop in blood pressure officials said 
the monarchs blood pressure stayed down for 30 minutes but 
doctors gave him a large blood transfusion and his vital signs 
stabilized imperial officials said 
kenji maeda imperial household agency spokesman said the 
emperor received a second transfusion later and was resting 
peacefully in the evening 
it was not possible to measure how much blood discharged from 
the emperors bowels but it was a considerable amount and more 
than in past days said maeda 
news reports said a red cross vehicle with blood again entered 
the imperial palace later today but palace officials did not 
immediately confirm that hirohito had still another transfusion 
hirohito has been bedridden with intestinal hemorrhaging since 
sept 19 when he vomited blood news reports have said he has 
intestinal cancer but palace officials have neither confirmed nor 
denied the reports 
earlier today the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper 
said the emperors overall condition was worsening and doctors 
feared his internal bleeding had spread from the upper intestine to 
other organs 
the 87yearold emperor the worlds longest reigning monarch 
is a symbol of the japanese state though he exercises no real 
power he has reigned since 1926 
crown prince akihito and crown princess michiko were summoned to 
the imperial palace after the emperors episode today and stayed 
for more than an hour 
prince aya hirohitos second grandson who arrived in tokyo 
today from london where he is attending oxford university also 
immediately visited the emperor 
it was the ninth day in a row that hirohito has been given 
blood he has been given a total of 94 pints of blood since sept 
19 more than the total amount of blood in his body news reports 
said 
earlier today the emperor ate food for the first time in nearly 
two weeks hirohito ate five or six spoonfuls of a porridge an 
imperial agency official said 
newspapers reported today that palace doctors were worried about 
the emperors worsening jaundice the reports said his hands and 
feet were swollen because of a malfunctioning kidney and vitamin 
deficiency 
maeda said hirohitos temperature today was 995 fahrenheit 
compared with his normal reading of about 959 
many autumn events have been canceled in japan in deference to 
hirohitos health including planned visits by overseas leaders 
newspapers said the government is considering postponing a visit 
by south korean president roh taewoo scheduled for midnovember 
but a foreign ministry official denied the reports and said the 
ministry was going ahead with preparations for the visit 
it would be the first visit to japan by roh since he took office 
in february

president mobutu sese seko and south 
african president pw botha held a historic summit meeting today 
to discuss economic ties and a plan to end the civil war in angola 
zaires southern neighbor 
after two hours of talks at mobutus palace the presidents told 
reporters the zairean leader had accepted bothas invitation to 
visit south africa 
no black african leader has visited south africa since botha 
took power in 1978 no date was set for mobutus visit 
our relations are on a new path mobutu said adding that 
they talked frankly and in great depthbotha said he was 
impressed with mobutus knowledge of southern africa affairs and 
called it a most successful morning 
botha arrived in mobutus ancestral village near the central 
african republic frontier to a red carpet but lowkey reception 
the talks began shortly afterward and were to last through the day 
in kinshasa the zairean capital 700 miles southwest of 
gbadolite where bothas plane stopped to refuel troops opened 
fire on about 200 students demonstrating at the university of 
kinshasa against his visit 
witnesses said at least two students were injured one hit in 
the neck by a bullet and another hit in the leg both were taken to 
the university clinic for treatment but their conditions were not 
known 
the meeting was bothas first with mobutu and his third summit 
in black africa during his 10 years in power all of them in the 
past three weeks 
after the morning meeting botha told reporters he and mobutu 
discussed the latest round of usmediated talks in the congolese 
capital of brazzaville aimed at a peace agreement between south 
africa and angola 
we discussed peace in africa and in southern africa 
especially we discussed the angolan question which is of vital 
importance to all of us and we discussed the southwest africa 
namibia problem which is being dealt with in the near future 
botha said 
both leaders said they would also discuss economic issues 
reporters and photographers who witnessed the start of the 
talks said mobutu welcomed botha in french and botha thanked 
mobutu for inviting him in a reply spoken in afrikaans the remarks 
were translated by interpreters 
mobutu in announcing the visit friday said south africa had 
asked for the meeting the zairean leader follows a firmly 
prowestern foreign policy 
on sept 13 botha met with president joaquim chissano of 
mozambique a longtime adversary of south africa the next day he 
visited president kamuzu banda of malawi the only african country 
to maintain full diplomatic relations with bothas whitecontrolled 
government 
one of bothas longstanding foreign policy goals has been to 
broaden ties with black africa without having to make substantive 
political concessions to the disenfranchised black majority in his 
own country there has been speculation about possible meetings 
between botha and other african leaders 
despite the lack of formal relations zaire and many other 
african countries trade with south africa and rely on its ports and 
railroad lines for handling imports and exports 
south african products ranging from toothpaste to meat are 
sold in zaire and more than a third of zaires main export 
copper is routed through south africa 
peace in angola might lead to reopening of a rail line linking 
southern zaire to angolas atlantic ocean port of lobito providing 
a more efficient route for copper exports 
the brazzaville talks between south africa and an angolancuban 
delegation adjourned thursday without agreement on the key issue of 
a timetable for withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban troops in 
angola supporting the government 
south africa has offered to begin implementation on nov 1 of a 
united nations plan for independence for southwest africa or 
namibia if a cuban withdrawal from angola can be negotiated 
angolas marxist government has accused zaire of allowing the 
unita rebel movement to operate from its territory and there have 
been repeated reports that us military aid for unita is routed 
through zaire

portauprince haiti ap haitis new military government has 
retired a powerful army colonel who was indicted on us drug 
charges and was once considered a leading candidate for chief of 
the armed forces 
a few bursts of gunfire were heard around portauprince late 
friday but there was no obvious sign today that col jeanclaude 
paul was resisting the retirement it was not known where he was 
several haitian leaders hailed the retirement after it was 
announced friday they said it showed that the 2weekold 
government was moving in the right direction 
they are giving proof of their sincerity to oust 
duvalierists said louis dejoie a former presidential candidate 
he was referring to dictators francois duvalier and his son 
jeanclaude who ruled haiti for 29 years until the younger 
duvalier was swept from power in a popular uprising in february 
1986 
both haitian and diplomatic sources said pauls retirement could 
eventually lead to renewed us aid to haiti which was cut off 
after a massacre of 34 people during elections last november in 
this caribbean nation 
the situation is positive and encouraging said susan clyde 
the us embassy spokeswoman she said the embassy was told that 
paul had been replaced by his secondincommand lt col guy 
francois an americantrained officer 
the brief announcement on state television late friday said only 
that paul was retired from the army and his post as commander of 
the feared 700man dessalines barracks in portauprince 
the announcer said the decision was signed by haitis president 
lt gen prosper avril and by the minister of defense and 
interior col carl dorsainvil it did not say when the retirement 
took effect 
in march paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in miami 
that accused him of conspiring to import cocaine into the united 
states paul has denied any involvement 
as head of the largest unit in haitis 7000member army paul 
had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the 
military haitian officials had said he could be named armed forces 
chief shortly after lt gen henri namphy took power in a military 
coup on sept 17 
however officials in washington said such a move could hurt 
ushaitian relations and it never materialized 
in june namphy had reassigned paul to an administrative 
position but paul refused and was backed by thenpresident leslie 
manigat namphy ousted manigat paul remained head of his battalion 
paul has been linked to the november massacre of voters at a 
polling place and to the tonton macoutes the hated personal 
security forces of the duvaliers 
told of pauls retirement one western diplomat said this 
means that the american government will certainly reinitiate 
assistance to haiti but will jeanclaude paul accept his 
retirement 
a haitian government official also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he was surprised by the development which he 
called a door wide open to restoration of us aid 
the 70 million annual package haitis largest source of 
foreign aid was ended after the election massacre 
dejoie said friday now the guns have changed shoulders i am 
very pleased at the attitude of this government the housecleaning 
is still going on in the army 
after rankandfile soldiers overthrew namphy two weeks ago 
they installed avril as president under a new military government 
they said they wanted to end random statesponsored violence and 
institute democratic reforms but the new rulers have set no date 
for elections 
the week after the coup chaos ruled as soldiers around the 
country rebelled against commanders and civilian mobs scoured the 
country looking for people linked to the duvalier regimes 
about 10000 mostly young people danced in the streets of 
portauprince on thursday in support of the soldiers coup it was 
one of the biggest outpourings seen in the capital since 
jeanclaude duvalier fled into exile in france some of them 
chanted long live paul down with america

irans leaders are rebuilding links with 
the rest of the world while the country moves slowly toward ending 
the war with iraq and perhaps ending the long ordeal of western 
hostages in lebanon 
the leaders face opposition from hardliners who fear that ending 
irans selfimposed isolation as it struggles to rebuild after 
eight years of war will undermine the islamic revolution 
iran is now at a crossroads one western analyst commented 
it must either become more inwardlooking or start looking 
outward 
the signs right now are that those advocating more openness 
hold sway but the next few months will be crucial either way 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati launched irans bridgebuilding campaign a year ago 
six months before tehran accepted a united nationssponsored 
ceasefire july 18 after a string of disastrous defeats 
the iranians fought the war virtually without allies while iraq 
had the soviet union france and most of the arab world behind it 
rafsanjani and his supporters realized that irans no west no 
east strategy was counterproductive 
he declared aug 21 our postwar foreign policy will be more 
open than our policy during the war we must take this opportunity 
to explain our aims and talk with the people of the world 
reining in irans unruly lebanese surrogates the fundamentalist 
hezbollah or party of god and other iranianbacked terrorist 
factions is a key component of his strategy 
he underlined that in a recent tehran radio broadcast in which 
he stressed that iran now is not thinking of exporting our 
revolution through direct intervention or by force the policy of 
force is not a successful policy 
groups linked to hezbollah the spearhead of the islamic 
revolution in lebanon are believed to hold most of the 17 
foreigners nine of them americans still missing in lebanon 
the longest held hostage an american is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
rafsanjani considered the most powerful figure in iran after 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has told britain that iran will help 
free british nationals held in lebanon including church of england 
envoy terry waite in return for normalizing relations 
on friday britain announced it would resume full relations with 
iran frozen last year after an iranian diplomat was arrested for 
shoplifting and a british diplomat was kidnapped and beaten in 
tehran 
the iranians have ranked britain second only to the united 
states as its main enemy in the west 
earlier last week it was announced that kuwait and iran were 
restoring full diplomatic relations 
for west germany the links it maintained with iran throughout 
the war have already paid off 
three germans kidnapped in lebanon by iranianbacked shiite 
moslem extremists were freed after tehran intervened the last 
french hostages were released in june and france restored ties to 
iran 
iran also has restored relations with canada and is improving 
ties with australia new zealand and the soviet bloc 
bringing hezbollahs wild men to heel will be no easy task 
diplomatic sources reported that rafsanjani was bitterly angry when 
lebanese militants hijacked a kuwaiti airliner in april and 
demanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in kuwait for bombings 
islamic jihad or islamic holy war one of the militant groups 
in lebanon has warned that speculation about imminent releases is 
a mirage but rafsanjanis moves have raised hopes that other 
captives will be freed 
in recent weeks government ministers and industrialists from a 
score of countries including west germany china denmark sweden 
japan and south korea have visted tehran 
many were lured by the prospect of lucrative contracts for 
reconstruction projects on which some analysts estimate iran will 
have to spend at least 40 billion 
rafsanjani who was involved in the secret armsforhostages 
deal with the united states in 198586 is seen by many in the west 
as the most pragmatic of the tehran hierarchy who would like to 
reopen a dialogue with the united states at some point 
but it is unlikely that relations will be restored soon with the 
united states long reviled as the great satan 
prime minister hussein musavi who leads the hardliners opposing 
irans opendoor policy declared sept 2 that speculation about a 
usiranian rapprochement was nothing but illusions 
he stressed considering the united states acts against iran 
the resumption of relations with washington would be a betrayal of 
the ideals of the revolution and those who have made sacrifices for 
it 
and on friday us secretary of state george p shultz said any 
us settlement with iran required an end to the iraniraq war an 
end to terrorism and the release of hostages 
there is no change in the situation as far as the united 
states and iran is concerned he said

those uneducated in the art of 
nasaspeak might think lox is eaten with bagels a pod is home to a 
pea smu is a college in texas and mum describes a pantomimist 
many of the journalists covering the flight of space shuttle 
discovery were new to the space agencys jargon and quickly became 
frustrated trying to translate the language of the national 
aeronautics and space administration 
for its part nasa hummed along sop 
when we bring someone in to brief reporters they speak in 
their normal tongue it becomes a quick way of communicating 
said pat phillips a nasa spokeswoman 
at the end of their first mission they reporters are pretty 
conversant its like at the end of a trip to paris being able to 
order your meals in french and navigate around the city she said 
phillips said there are about 20 to 30 major acronyms and 
that once you learn these you are truly conversant 
frequently at the shuttle briefings nasa officials referred to 
gse for ground support equipment imf or inflight maintenance 
tal transatlantic abort landing sites and tdrs pronounced 
teedrus and standing for tracking and data relay satellite the 
100 million communications satellite that was deployed on 
discoverys first day in orbit 
nasa included a 4page glossary of acronyms in its press kit 
for the discovery flight which drew 2318 news media 
representatives to the kennedy space center to cover the first 
shuttle launch since the challenger disaster jan 28 1986 
the acronyms in the press kit were culled from a 138page 
terminology guide given to space center employees nasa 
headquarters in washington has a 305page guide with about 15 
terms per page 
at one prelaunch briefing a frustrated reporter suggested 
another acronym for the space agencys lexicon afe meaning 
acronyms for everything 
other reporters including longtime space writers applauded his 
request that nasa briefers speak english 
its a problem said ron kotulak a chicago tribune reporter 
who has covered space launches for more than 20 years its like 
the priesthood using symbols to keep the outside out 
hugh j martin covering his first shuttle launch for the tampa 
tribune said some reporters were confused by nasas explanation of 
a damaged oring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttle 
flight 
a large number of people didnt understand most of that 
explanation but what they did understand was that there was a 
cut in an oring he said 
it was a flawed oring joining segments of a booster rocket that 
allowed superheated gas to burn through and spark the explosion 
that destroyed challenger 
martin said some newspapers reported the story incorrectly 
making the problem seem more critical than it actually was 
in that case nasa shot themselves in the foot he said 
frank merlino nasa test director said the jargon really 
helps to condense conversations to the action its like slang it 
lets you get your point across quickly 
fyi lox stands for liquid oxygen pod is the payload operations 
director smu means speakermicrophone unit and mum is the mass

as emperor hirohito clings to life japan has taken 
up a vigil revealing affection and respect as well as disagreement 
about the countrys most ancient institution 
signs of the turning of an era seem to be everywhere from weeks 
of gloomy weather to the throngs who trudge under umbrellas to sign 
registers urging recovery for the ailing 87yearold monarch 
about 3 million people have signed such registers nationwide 
but a minority complain that the emperor is an outdated figurehead 
and that its wrong for the authorities to encourage adulation 
last week about 150 people from the japan citizens league 
marched in tokyo to protest media portrayals that it said implies 
the entire nation sympathizes with a man who they note is largely 
powerless 
but some nervousness is evident prime minister noboru 
takeshitas cabinet canceled important foreign trips letting 
lowerrankers handle official business abroad 
hirohito has held the chrysanthemum throne since christmas day 
1926 and in a country where people put great store in acting 
collectively few remember how to act as the emperors life seems 
to be slipping away 
the government decided last week to try to put a brake on the 
cancellations of autumn festivals fireworks displays parades and 
school sports fests 
what is happening here must appear so queer to foreigners 
the liberalleaning asahi shimbun newspaper said friday in an 
editorial 
when hirohito assumed the throne he was regarded as a living 
god and todays older japanese were taught he was the focus of 
personal obligation as well as a benevolent father of the japanese 
family 
in legend japanese emperors descended from the sun goddess and 
the imperial family the oldest royal line in the world with its 
symbol the chrysanthemum dates to at least the eighth century 
with rare exceptions emperors have been more like high priests of 
shintoism the indigenous japanese religion than rulers with real 
power 
hirohito bears all that mythic baggage as well as the mixed 
legacy of his titular leadership in japans crushing defeat in 
world war ii and the moralebuilding that helped contribute to the 
countrys rise to economic prowess 
he renounced his divinity in 1946 and the postwar constitution 
largely imposed by us occupation authorities stripped him of all 
government and political roles it also required separation of 
state and religion 
many young people who journeyed to the palace in central tokyo 
to pay tribute say they have been unexpectedly affected as if a 
beloved grandfather were ill 
retailers reported a run on risingsun flags with some asking 
how to fly them at halfstaff books about the emperor sold briskly 
while about 80 percent of the japanese say they support the 
emperor system a steady minority are uncomfortable with it 
the japan citizens league held its rally because we didnt 
want foreign people especially those in asian countries to think 
the whole nation of japan is sympathizing with the emperor and 
worried about his illness said ryuzo harada secretary general 
of the group 
the japan communist party kept silent after hirohitos condition 
turned serious on sept 19 but recently began running editorials 
in its akahata red flag newspaper reminding its 600000 readers 
of hirohitos wartime role 
many christians a 1 percent minority in japan are worried that 
glorification of the emperor could lead to renewed official links 
with shinto when crown prince akihito 54 is consecrated on the 
throne 
shinto proponents like author hideake kase say the emperor is 
a priestking not a head of state in the western mold 
we dont really need a head of state but we need a head of 
the family or chief of the japanese tribe kase said 
kase proposed the imperial family retire to kyoto the ancient 
capital away from the politics and business of tokyo and live out 
of the public eye as a cultural institution 
some old soldiers who were exhorted during world war ii to lay 
down their lives for the emperor are among those disturbed by the 
outpouring of sentiment seeing people kneeling at the imperial 
palace is quite the same as what we saw during wartime one 
70yearold former army officer said 
the veteran was worried about a return to a spiritual 
dictatorship like the 1930s and 40s when japanese soldiers were 
told they were freeing asian countries from western colonization 
yoshio oishi professor emeritus at kyoto universitys law 
faculty found the sympathy understandable and apolitical 
hirohito is the symbol of the nations consolidation through a 
long history and visiting the palace to pray for his recovery is 
an expression of sympathetic feelings for the ailing man oishi

here are some basic facts about kosmos 1900 
the soviet spy satellite expected to fall to earth soon based on 
information provided by the us and canadian governments 
type kosmos 1900 is a soviet rorsat ocean reconnaissance 
satellite powered by a nuclear reactor like two others which have 
fallen to earth kosmos 954 in 1978 which dropped on remote 
northwest canada and kosmos 1402 which splashed into the indian 
ocean in 1983 
size western experts estimate the weight of kosmos 1900 at 
about 2200 pounds and its dimensions about 20 feet by 7 feet 
reactor the satellite carries a nuclear reactor estimated to 
weigh about 220 pounds and fueled by an estimated 110 pounds of 
uranium u235 much of which will have degraded to radioactive 
isotopes 
odds the satellite has been falling slowly from orbit since 
april when the soviets lost radio communications with it the 
chances are 66 percent that it will land in water 33 percent on 
land 5 percent in the united states 3 percent in canada and 1 
percent onto a populated area 
fallout if the reactor ejects on reentry as planned the 
radioactive material will turn to dust and settle slowly from the 
atmosphere posing little danger if the reactor reenters the 
atmosphere protected by the satellite the radioactive bits 
probably would be about the same size as those from kosmos 954 
experts recovered 3000 such pieces most less than a millimeter 
long or 04 inches with a few 500 to 700 milimeters long 20 to 
28 inches according to canadian officials 
danger humans face danger from exposure to gamma radiation from 
highly radioactive material the larger the radioactive piece the 
greater the danger 
precautions listen for official warnings carried by the media 
stay indoors if authorities warn that the satellite will be falling 
in your area do not touch or remain in the vicinity of strange 
objects if you come into contact with such objects remove 
contaminated clothes place them in a plastic bag shower and call 
the authorities 
reimbursement the soviet government repaid canada one half the 
35 million required to clean up material from kosmos 954 canada 
did not seek compensation for environmental damages

a judges finding that the fbi discriminated 
against its hispanic agents is the second time in less than a year 
that the bureau has been embarrassed over its treatment of minority 
employees 
last november black fbi agent donald rochon filed a lawsuit in 
us district court accusing the bureau of racial harassment when 
he was an agent in omaha neb and chicago the suit is pending 
the federal equal employment opportunity commission has already 
ruled in favor of rochon over those allegations concerning racial 
mistreatment while he was in omaha 
increasing the hiring of minorities has been a matter of rising 
concern among the last two fbi directors william webster and 
william sessions 
webster now cia director used to carry a card with him giving 
the latest statistics on how many minority agents the fbi had 
recruitment of minorities and women was one of the first issues 
sessions addressed after becoming director last november he has 
said the fbis makeup should reflect american society 
currently there are 423 hispanic agents and 412 black agents 
among some 9400 a total of 851 agents are women including 37 
hispanics and 65 blacks 
us district judge lucius buntons conclusions friday in the 
hispanics suit address questions of advancement and treatment of 
hispanics within the bureau 
because the fbi has become a major participant in the war on 
drugs it needs spanishspeaking agents 
bunton agreed with the allegation that hispanic agents often are 
called off major cases to work on lesser cases to use their 
spanishlanguage ability then were not given credit for their work 
on the cases they were taken away from 
many other agents with training in law or accounting are placed 
on a fast track of promotion up through the ranks the judge said 
bunton said he understood the fbi needs spanishspeaking agents 
because of the war on drugs but that the need for such agents does 
not justify benefit and promotion systems which do not reward 
hispanic agents in a manner commensurate with their admitted 
contribution to the bureau 
problems of recruitment and promotion of minorities and women 
were underscored last week with the resignation of wayne g davis 
a black who is the special agent in charge of the fbis 
philadelphia office 
he is the highestranking black operating in the field for the 
fbi and is the only black special agent in charge at any of the 
bureaus 58 field offices across the country 
at washington headquarters john glover who also is black is 
executive assistant director of administration 
the fbis office of equal employment opportunity which is one 
of the many areas under glovers control came in for heavy 
criticism from the judge in the ruling on the hispanics suit the 
eeo is in the administrative services division which is headed by 
assistant director edwin sharp 
the hispanics testified during the trial of their suit that they 
did not trust the fairness of eeo procedures and that they feared 
widespread retaliation or a negative stigma attaching to any 
employee filing a grievance with eeo 
at the trial the fbi did not produce evidence that any 
hispanic eeo complaint had ever been found to be substantiated 
said the judge 
every fbi office has two eeo counselors with each being given 
just two hours of training by the head of the employment 
opportunity office and a packet of study materials 
the eeo and the bureau have never performed any studies to 
determine whether promotional processes are fair in method or in 
outcome or whether assignments benefits or training programs are 
operated in an unbiased fashion said the judge 
the highest ranking female in the bureau is carolyn morris 
deputy assistant director in the technical services division at fbi 
headquarters she is black

commander frederick h hauck today 
took time out from the discovery crews schedule to read a letter 
from a new york teenager who said he was worried about the 
future and assured the boy that america is back on track 
in the letter sent to hauck before the launch pj morgan of 
brooklyn said 
dear mr hauck im a worried 14yearold that is worried 
about the future i feel that some of americas future is riding on 
you and your crews shoulders i give you all the inspiration i can 
give you because your ride this fall means so much to me 
hauck said he received the letter within the last year and a 
half and called the boy just before the launch 
i thought it was a particularly good letter and really sent 
home to us how much the experiences we have here in space can have 
an effect on the youngsters of america hauck said 
hauck said morgan told him he had been inspired by his science 
teacher at st marks parochial school in brooklyn because he had 
some concerns about the future of america and whether we were still 
capable of doing the things that make us a great country 
the mission commander thanked the boy for the letter and said he 
hoped all the other youngsters out there not only in america but 
in other parts of the world that may be watching and can see that 
we are back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits 
that will come in the future 
the mission commander read the letter just after astronaut john 
m lounge had finished conducting a scientific experiment that was 
designed by a high school student 
nasa said pjs parents had asked that their address and 
telephone number not be given out

authorities thought it was a radioactive soviet 
satellite but the glittering smoking sphere that closed the 
parislille superhighway for nearly two hours turned out to be 
carnival equipment 
the 6foot aluminum sphere fell off a carnival truck friday 
night and the electrical workings inside apparently caught fire 
from the impact officials said 
the soviet nuclearpowered cosmos 1900 satellite remained in 
earth orbit but was expected to fall into the atmosphere sometime 
this week french space specialists say the chances it will fall on 
french territory are about one in a thousand 
at about 9 pm friday a motorist on the highway near peronne 
about 85 miles north of paris saw the smoking shiny debris and 
alerted police 
dozens of gendarmes firemen and civil defense workers were 
called out to divert traffic around the area and establish a 
security perimeter

prime minister brian mulroney placing his 
freetrade agreement with the united states on the line and 
inviting the people to judge us today called a federal 
election for nov 21 
speaking to reporters outside government house where governor 
general jeanne sauve had just dissolved parliament mulroney 
promised the progressive conservatives will offer an agenda of 
confidence for canada with the freetrade pact very much a 
centrepiece of his partys campaign 
he pointed to the creation of jobs in canada more than 1000 
each day he has been in power he said he also promised increased 
social aid to those who need it a national commitment to a 
pollutionfree canada and an agreement with the united states to 
cut emissions believed to cause acid rain 
the election call came two days after a poll indicating that the 
conservatives have a substantial lead over the main opposition 
liberal party and the socialist new democratic party 
despite presiding over a healthy economy and negotiating an 
accord to bring quebec back into the constitution mulroney has 
struggled with a credibility problem referred to in the press as 
the sleaze factor he has lost eight cabinet members in 
scandals ranging from tainted tuna to criminal charges 
the democrats and liberals oppose the freetrade deal which 
would eliminate tariffs over 10 years between the united states and 
canada and dismantle barriers to investment and competition 
the agreement has been blocked in the unelected senate by the 
liberal majority liberal party leader john turner has promised the 
senate blockade will be lifted if mulroney wins a majority in the 
election for the 295 seats in the house the commons which has 
approved the freetrade agreement 
the deal must be passed by the senate to become law 
turner and new deomcratic party leader ed broadbent claim the 
freetrade agreement jeopardizes canadian sovereignty 
when the commons was dissolved the conservatives held 204 
seats the liberals had 38 the democrats 32 independents 3 
independent liberals 1 and four seats were vacant because of 
redistribution 13 seats will be added to the commons for the 
november election 
mulroney 49 hopes the conservatives will be the first majority 
government returned with a majority since the liberals under louis 
st laurent in 1953 
although the constitution allowed mulroney to serve a fiveyear 
term he chose to follow the lead of other candadian prime 
ministers and call the election after governing about four years 
he began his fourth year in office on sept 17 
an angus reid poll released thursday indicated mulroneys party 
had support from 40 percent of respondents compared with 31 
percent for the new democratic party and 26 percent for the 
liberals 
mulroney who became leader of his party in 1983 and scored a 
landslide victory a year later had been waiting for such 
encouraging signs before calling an election 
if he wins the worlds two largest trading partners will 
proceed with plans to create a north american free trade zone on 
jan 1 
if he loses both the main opposition liberal party and the 
socialist new democratic party say they will tear up the complex 
trade deal hailed by president reagan as only a beginning in a 
global free flow of trade

discovery was operating just 
super today as its five astronauts photographed landmarks on 
earth melted titanium and read a letter of inspiration from a 
brooklyn high school student 
only a few minor problems had arisen as the first 
postchallenger flight reached its midpoint and a flight director 
at mission control center in houston reported the five crewmen were 
having a ball 
during a television program from 184 miles up mission 
specialist john m lounge sent electrical heat through four glass 
tubes containing titanium wires to determine if heating the metal 
in weightlessness could strengthen it 
the experiment proposed by lloyd bruce a senior at the 
university of missouri was selected from thousands submitted to 
nasa in its student involvement program bruce a high school 
student at the time he made the proposal watched on tv at the 
johnson space center in houston and will analyze test results after 
discovery returns 
following the experiment commander frederick h hauck appeared 
on the screen and read a letter he had received several months ago 
from phillip j morgan a brooklyn high school student who was 14 
at the time he wrote it he said the letter was especially 
meaningful to his crew 
the letter read in part i feel that some of americas future 
is riding on you and your crews shoulder i give you all the 
inspiration i can give you because your ride this fall means so 
much to me 
hauck said he had talked with phillip and his mother by phone 
and that the youth told him he had some concerns about the future 
of america and whether we are still capable the things that make us 
a great country 
i thought it was a particularly good letter and really sent 
home to us how much the experiences we have here in space can have 
an effect on the youngsters of america hauck said 
the astronauts read a teletype message radioed to them overnight 
congratulating them for another super job yesterday and giving 
baseball scores and the news of the shakeup in the soviet 
government 
the message also said without explanation there was no 
update on the sinks at pilot richard o coveys house and said 
the wives of the crew send their greetings and report they 
represented you well at the outpost 
the outpost is a bar that is a favorite of the astronauts near 
the johnson space center in houston 
the astronauts were very quiet in the hours after wakeup today 
as they went about the business of experiments and spacecraft 
checks 
they photographed a crater in oman forest preserves in india 
an indonesian volcano chain and a lake in egypt pictures taken of 
the earths horizon at sunrise and sunset could help develop better 
horizon sensors for satellites 
the astronauts were awakened promptly at 437 am edt this 
time by a mock version of a beach boys tune with lyrics saying 
round round we orbit round and were going to town 
well were racking up the miles with a whole lot of power 
were going seventeen thousand five hundred an hour 
the loud tune piped up by mission control in houston prompted 
crew member george d pinky nelson to radio back dont stop 
good morning houston great tune 
nelson and his four crewmates hauck covey and mission 
specialists lounge and david c hilmers then began about an hour 
of exercising before having breakfast and setting about their 
chores for the day 
television pictures from space showed the astronauts obviously 
pleased as they floated about the cabin in weightlessness but they 
also were businesslike as they conducted a series of experiments 
and tested spacecraft systems many of them new and the rest unused 
for more than 32 months 
todays planned experiments included growing crystals in 
weightlessness photographing the horizon at sunrise and sunset and 
testing an infrared communications system 
the communications test called for the astronauts to try to talk 
with one another using the kind of invisible infrared light that 
remotely controls home television sets they were to use their 
regular communications headsets to convey messages by these 
lightwaves through a series of transmitters and receivers 
one use of such a system would be as a secure communications 
loop inside an orbiting spacecraft unlike radio frequency signals 
infrared signals will not pass through a shuttles windows 
several classified military flights are planned on the shuttle 
in coming years 
later today hauck was to don one of the pressure suits the 
astronauts will wear during the descent to earth on monday in case 
they have to make an emergency bailout while trying to land at 
edwards air force base in california 
nelson was to practice installing a telescoping pole in the 
cabin for an emergency bailout the crew would blow out the cabin 
hatch extend the pole outside and slide down it to clear the 
spaceship wing before opening parachutes 
the practice was to see how long the preparations take in 
weightlessness 
the escape system would be of use only if the shuttle were in 
stable gliding flight it was added after challenger exploded 32 
months ago killing seven astronauts but would not have helped 
then because the explosion occurred too early into the launch 
flight director j milton heflin attributed the astronauts 
relative silence friday to the many new orbiter systems the crew is 
checking a total of 210 were introduced following the challenger 
explosion 
an antenna became stuck and had to be remotely stowed back in 
the cargo bay by radio control reducing the number of television 
broadcasts from space when the same thing happened on a flight 
four years ago the antenna was repaired by an astronaut during a 
spacewalk 
the crew also had to contend for the first two days with a cabin 
temperature of 84 degrees because of a lingering malfunction in a 
cooling system but the problem was cleared up by today 
the orbiter is great the systems on board the orbiter are 
doing quite well its operating just super heflin said 
friday 
back at cape canaveral the redesigned booster rockets that 
powered discovery toward orbit were towed into port and looked 
absolutely clean said john thomas the nasa engineer who 
directed their redesign

a cadet who lost part of a leg in 
a traffic accident has lost his bid to stay in the air force 
academy in spite of his handicap 
a pentagon rule calls for disenrollment of any service 
academy cadet who loses all or part of a limb and air force 
secretary edward c aldridge approved that action friday for cadet 
third class dan korslund 
aldridge had been pressured by two senators several advocates 
for the disabled and an organization of amputee athletes pushing 
for korslund who would have been in his sophomore year this fall 
aldridge announced his decision in a letter to sen william 
armstrong rcolo who said he would ask president reagan to 
consider the case 
korslund 20 lost part of his right leg in june while helping a 
friend start a stalled car on interstate 25 near the academy 
grounds 
at the time of the accident korslund had been confined to the 
academy grounds in a disciplinary matter and technically was absent 
without leave the colorado springs gazette telegraph quoted 
sources as saying 
armstrong who had tried to keep korslund in the academy called 
aldridges decision a great mistake 
in addition to the pentagon rule aldridge said it would be a 
waste of taxpayers money to send korslund to school when there is 
no possibility he would be allowed to serve in the air force 
military officials estimate it costs about 200000 to send a cadet 
through a service academy 
an air force spokesman at the pentagon said current policy does 
allows seniors who become medically disabled in their final 
semester to graduate 
academy spokesman will ketterson said korslund was advised of 
the decision friday at a veterans administration hospital in 
seattle near his home in tacoma where he was transferred earlier 
in the week 
a man answering the telephone at the va hospital said korslund 
was not available for comment and had in fact left the hospital 
he has been discharged and thats all im allowed to say 
said the man who refused to give his name

rifletoting police patrolled the streets and 
monasteries of tibets capital saturday on the first anniversary of 
antichinese protests that left at least 14 people dead 
foreign travelers contacted in the remote himalayan region 
reported no incidents as about 200 police guarded lhasas holy 
jokhang temple the main site of the bloody oct 1 1987 riots 
michael ruh of west germany said police carrying rifles walked 
continuously on the square in front of the temple and on the 
lingkor the pilgrims path around the jokhang 
you can see them on the rooftops with binoculars ruh added 
the protests last year on chinas oct 1 national day were led 
by buddhist monks loyal to tibets exiled spiritual leader the 
dalai lama and seeking an end to chinese rule over tibet 
an australian traveler said he was detained briefly by tibetan 
police while walking near the jokhang on friday night they 
pushed us around and were a little hostile at first but they 
gradually calmed down and became tibetan again said the man who 
identified himself only as jeremy 
describing police as ready and jumpy but hoping that 
nothing will happen the australian said he and a friend counted 
33 trucks carrying about 40 police each patrolling the city 
travelers were told by security officers they would be punished 
if they took part in protests and warned them to stay away from the 
jokhang and the nearby barkhor market 
ruh said authorities closed a secondfloor cafe overlooking the 
jokhang that is frequented by travelers an 1130 pm curfew has 
been in effect since last sunday he said

the next us president should increase 
spending for nonnuclear weapons and meet military budgets by 
cancelling new weapons instead of cutting training a bipartisan 
group of legislators recommended saturday 
like a sentry on a long uneventful watch when things seem so 
quiet our current defense policy relies too heavily on complacent 
assumptions that all is well said the study 
we seem to believe that our big guns our strategic nuclear 
missiles our proposed space weapons will somehow save us from 
all problems all foes it warned 
the report was released by the congressional military reform 
caucus a 7yearold bipartisan group of senators and house members 
who have pushed for improvements in us defenses the group is 
chaired by reps charles bennett dfla and tom ridge rpa 
the study called for shifting money from longrange nuclear 
weapons and star wars antimissile research into conventional 
forces such as armor and tanks no figures or force levels were 
recommended 
the report also noted that budget restrictions will be 
reductions in future military spending plans the pentagon budget 
has been essentially frozen for the past four years after four 
years of large increases during president reagans first term 
whoever succeeds reagan republican george bush or democrat 
michael dukakis will have to make difficult choices and he should 
cancel future weapons rather than cutting back on basics such as 
training and ammunition the study said 
in addition it said the us military should go to a back to 
basics strategic which decreases dependence on shortrange atomic 
weapons and hightechnology systems and which relies more on 
defenses such as better armor 
in some areas of europe we stockpile only nine days of 
ammunition yet last year we allocated some 31 billion to 
strategic nuclear weapons it said 
we have spent 20 billion on mx missiles designed to fly 5000 
miles and hit within 100 yards of their targets but we do not have 
in our arsenal an infantry weapon that can fly 500 yards and stop a 
modern soviet tank the study added 
part of the report focused on the north atlantic treaty 
organization or nato and its ability to protect western europe 
from attack by the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies 
while noting that there is no conclusive way to assess natos 
capability versus the warsaw pact the study called for more 
nonnuclear weapons 
there is a growing sense in congress that we must rely more 
on conventional weapons the study said 
while not endorsing either bush or dukakis the warning to beef 
up spending on conventional weapons echoes calls by dukakis 
the soviets have a numerical advantage in tanks which has been 
estimated at three to one the report called for a system of 
antitank barriers in west germany which would be the most likely 
site for a soviet conventional attack on nato 
the problems with building barriers have been political not 
military the study said they have been resisted by the west 
germans for fear that would reinforce the partitioning of their 
country 
but this resistance could be overcome particularly if seen as 
part of an effort to reduce the level of both nuclear and 
conventional forces it said

george bush holds an electoral college edge 
over michael dukakis entering the final five weeks of the white 
house campaign but tight races from connecticut to california 
portend a volatile finish according to an associated press survey 
of the 50 states 
democratic concern over dukakis candidacy is evident although 
party officials say there is ample time for the massachusetts 
governor to triumph 
its not over yet by any stretch of the imagination said 
democratic rep charles stenholm of texas but hes got to go on 
the offensive against bushs charges that dukakis is too liberal 
republicans say the vice president has hit his stride and the 
issues are working in his favor dukakis won the primary on his 
massachusetts miracle claim but now people are remembering what 
government the economy was under jimmy carter said tony 
feather executive director of the republican party in missouri 
where the two candidates are rated even 
nationwide public opinion surveys indicate a narrow advantage 
for bush although the same surveys show enough undecided and 
loosely committed voters to alter the outcome of the race 
adding to the uncertainty is a campaign calendar that includes a 
debate next wednesday between vice presidential candidates dan 
quayle and lloyd bentsen followed by a return engagement between 
dukakis and bush in midoctober after that comes a threeweek 
sprint to the finish line punctuated by a barrage of television 
commercials 
a lot of people are not happy with either candidate and the 
last week or two theyll decide what to do said georgias lt 
gov zell miller a democrat 
despite steady latesummer advances by bush and democratic 
talk of a dukakis rebound neither man has been able to seize an 
advantage in a string of states where the election will be decided 
the list includes michigan ohio illinois missouri new jersey 
connecticut california and others totaling over 150 electoral 
votes 
it takes 270 electoral votes to win the white house and the 
only democrat to make it in the last five elections was a 
southerner carter 
according to an ap survey of political leaders independent 
analysts and public opinion polls in all 50 states bush appears to 
be solidifying much of the traditional republican base across the 
south and rocky mountain west he is rated the solid leader in 
florida with its 21 electoral college votes and seems to be opening 
a little daylight between himself and the democrats in texas 
although dukakis is waging an intensive campaign in running mate 
bentsens home state 
border states such as oklahoma arkansas kentucky and tennessee 
remain competitive 
dukakis is given the edge in several traditional democratic 
party strongholds including new york and its 36 electoral votes 
but has not been as successful as bush in cementing his own 
political base 
the ap survey turned up frequent expressions of concern among 
democrats over the shape of dukakis campaign tempered with hope 
that he may be on the rebound after suffering a political freefall 
earlier in the campaign 
i think we have turned around what i perceived was a slide 
here said ohios democratic chairman jim ruvolo 
in maryland a traditional democratic state where the polls show 
a close race the partys vice chairman john willis said i 
would like to be further ahead i would like to be 20 points ahead 
but thats unrealistic 
republicans who were worried when bush was down in the polls 
last summer are smiling now that he is showing surprising strength 
in states such as new york pennsylvania and iowa that figured to 
be among his weakest 
it looks like a dead heat in states like new york and 
massachusetts and a really strong democratic candidate should be 
considerably ahead in states like those at this point said 
robert s poliner chairman of the republican party in connecticut 
dukakis remains the favorite in both massachusetts and new york 
the ap survey showed 
senior campaign aides to both men offer different perspectives 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater said bushs electoral 
college base of 210 to 220 votes is intact freeing the vice 
president to campaign intensively in swing states with occasional 
forays into democratic strongholds 
dukakis aides say the race will be won or lost in the large 
number of battleground states where neither candidate has the edge 
the race has tightened up and its competitive and a lot of 
people havent made up their minds said dukakis communications 
director leslie dach the states that we need to win this race 
are very competitive 
the electoral college lineup looks like this 
bushs strongest region is probably the south where he leads 
almost everywhere bentsens presence on the ticket guarantees a 
close race in texas however and dukakis has strong support in 
north carolina and border states such as arkansas kentucky and 
tennessee 
california and washington on the west coast are rated as 
tossups with dukakis given the edge in oregon bush appears to 
have firmed up support in traditional republican states such as 
utah idaho and wyoming but the dukakis campaign says it has 
strength in new mexico and montana 
farm states such as kansas and nebraska are leaning to bush 
while dukakis harbors hopes for the dakotas the democrat is 
favored in iowa wisconsin and minnesota in the upper midwest 
dukakis has no hopes for quayles home state of indiana he seems 
to have a slight edge in illinois but democrats concede he is 
probably slightly behind in ohio and missouri republicans see a 
narrow advantage in michigan 
the northeast is dukakis strongest region and despite 
closerthanexpected public polls he is regarded as the likely 
winner at home in massachusetts as well as new york rhode island 
maryland and west virginia vermont and maine appear to be close 
and new hampshire is bush territory

a race is on between illegal artifact 
hunters grabbing valuable indian tools exposed by a receding lake 
and archaeologists who need the relics to piece together the puzzle 
of a prehistoric culture 
despite laws making it illegal to collect artifacts on federal 
land the archaeologists are losing 
its like checking a book out of the library and never 
bringing it back for anyone else to read c melvin aikens a 
professor of anthropology at the university of oregon said of the 
loss of the artifacts its a tragedy 
for thousands of years ancestors of the burns paiute tribe went 
to the marshes of malheur lake in the high desert of southeastern 
oregon to hunt and harvest edible seeds 
they left behind exquisitely crafted points for their lances and 
arrows made out of obsidian a dark volcanic glass chips of chert 
a type of rock used to skin the muskrat they trapped in the 
bullrushes and stones used to grind the seed 
for the past four years their lakeside camps have been covered 
by the highest water in recorded history on malheur lake the focus 
of a big basin with no outlet 
the water rose nearly eight feet higher than normal tripling 
the lake in size to more than 180000 acres and flooding ranches 
roads railroad tracks and a school 
the high water allowed waves to scour the land washing away 
three to four feet of soil in places and now that drought has 
allowed evaporation to catch up and the lake is receding thousands 
of years worth of artifacts are being revealed 
graves also are being exposed 
there is an old indian legend about people living around the 
lake offended one of the spirits said dale hile tribal manager 
of the burns paiutes a shaman cast a spell and a plague killed 
off a lot of people years and years ago the indication is there 
probably could be up to a hundred gravesites 
we want to get in and deal with all this before the vegetation 
takes over then the pothunters take the rest 
some newly exposed islands look as if someone scattered museum 
displays on the ground besides stone age indian artifacts there 
also are leavings of the homesteaders who drove them out 
these are what you call diagnostic artifacts said george 
constantino manager of the malheur national wildlife refuge as he 
stooped to examine an eightinch obsidian point when you have 
those pieces its like you have the corners of the jigsaw puzzle 
these are just nationalquality sites irreplacable sites but 
they are just going away one piece at a time 
constantino has just himself and an assistant to patrol the 150 
miles of shoreline he hopes to get another helper and periodic 
stakeouts by a federal strike team last summer he cited three 
people carrying shovels who had hidden their truck in the brush 
but the race still is being lost 
thirteen days after we looked at this one island we had an 
archaeological crew there and someone had beat us to it 
constantino said of the nine sites all but two have been 
previously collected 
aikens said preserving the archaeological record is much more 
than just scooping up arrowheads 
we need to know where they were found what else was with 
it he said if you dont know the age of the materials and 
where they came from there is no potential to reconstruct a 
culture 
its the kind of thing that has to be done judiciously over 
the long haul he said 
an archaeological team that has spent the summer on a dig in the 
nearby diamond valley will soon begin a threeweek 10000 survey 
of sites on the lake and collect and catalog pieces on the surface 
that the illegal hunters havent gotten yet 
but artifact hunters have become so bold that some recently 
looted the diamond valley dig after the archaeologists stopped for 
the day constantino said 
its everthing from grandpa and grandma to the 
professionals constantino said the best ones are just as 
covert as illegal drug traffickers 
as much as everyone wants to pick up that arrowhead and put it 
in their pocket they are taking information away from the 
future he said

sens lloyd bentsen of texas and dan quayle of 
indiana have voted together for the reagan tax cuts military aid 
to the contras money for the mx missile and the death penalty for 
drugrelated murders 
on such issues as defense and capital punishment in fact 
bentsens voting record is at odds not with quayle but with his 
own running mate michael dukakis quayle on the other hand has 
little apparent quarrel with any of george bushs positions 
still the two vice presidential candidates have often found 
themselves at loggerheads including a recent battle over whether 
to give workers 60 days notice of plant closings 
as they gird for their nationally televised debate in omaha 
neb wednesday night each will be probing the others record for 
points of attack 
for the younger less experienced republican whose credentials 
the democrats have ridiculed the debate may also be an opportunity 
to emphasize those issues where he bush and bentsen are of one 
mind and dukakis is of another 
but there will also be ample opportunity for bentsen to point 
out stark differences between his and quayles voting records on 
social programs labor issues civil rights education energy and 
other matters 
bentsen 67 has served nearly 24 years in congress twice as 
long as his 41yearold rival and the texan is near the pinnacle 
of the senate power structure as chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
in this year alone bentsen has been the democrats point man in 
successful efforts to enact major legislation on trade 
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and the nations 
welfare programs 
a defenseminded texas tory bentsen was pushing for tax cuts 
including a lower capital gains tax back in the late 1970s during 
the carter administratio when he chaired the joint economic 
committee 
quayle is a backbench republican who sits on the armed 
services budget and labor and human services committees his main 
legislative accomplishment during eight years in the senate was the 
job training partnership act of 1983 
he made that legislative effort with support from a liberal 
democrat sen edward kennedy of massachusetts over the 
reservations of the reagan administration 
quayle has been a stalwart supporter of the strategic defense 
initiative but bentsen also supports it like bentsen quayle 
voted in 1986 to override reagans veto of a bill imposing 
sanctions against south africas apartheid regime 
on the campaign trail quayle almost never mentions bentsen 
while constantly pillorying dukakis as weak on defense and as 
merely another inexperienced liberal governor like jimmy 
carter the last democrat to occupy the white house 
but as a freshman member of the house in 1977 quayle supported 
carters plan to kill the b1 bomber in the pivotal vote quayle 
and seven other republicans sided with the democrats on a 202199 
showdown on the issue reagan revived the b1 when he took office 
and all 100 bombers now have been built 
quayle voted to sustain reagans veto this year of the civil 
rights restoration act bentsen voted for the successful override 
on the plant closing notification law quayle was the leading 
opponent and bentsen the leading proponent quayle argued it would 
impose a legislative straitjacket on industry and impede our 
capacity to compete in world markets 
bentsen and quayle debated the issue last april 22 on public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour reagan later vetoed the trade 
bill because it contained the 60day notice provision 
but bentsen and fellow democrats came back with separate trade 
and plant closing notification bills reagan eventually signed the 
trade bill and let the plant closing notification measure become 
law without his signature 
bentsen and quayle were on opposite sides of this years effort 
in congress to raise the 335anhour minimum wage for the first 
time since 1981 
quayle after initially resisting any increase supported a 
compromise including a subminimum training wage for teenagers 
quayle says he now supports a 4 minimum wage but says what the 
working poor really need is better training and education not a 
higher minimum wage 
there will be no increase in the minimum wage this year 
however faced with the threat of a republican filibuster and 
unwilling to accept a subminimum wage for teens senate democrats 
recently dropped efforts to raise the minimum to 455 
bentsen votes most of the time with the democratic majority but 
he has broken ranks to support reagan requests on contra aid sdi 
and the mx mobile missile 
quayle was an outspoken opponent of legislation to ban the use 
of lie detectors in the workplace and he complained when the white 
house dropped its opposition last march that it had caved like a 
house of cards bentsen supported the bill 
bentsen and quayle were on opposite sides of the senates may 9 
1985 vote for a oneyear budget freeze including social security 
that passed 5049 with bush casting the tiebreaker but while 
bentsen voted against a freeze on that occasion he voted twice in 
1984 and 1985 for other freeze proposals that would have delayed 
social security costofliving increases for six or 12 months 
on other issues 
bentsen has voted in favor of prayer in public schools and for 
a constitutional amendment to balance the budget both of which 
are opposed by dukakis and supported by bush and quayle 
bentsen the texan also favors an oil import fee which 
dukakis bush and quayle oppose 
the democrat senator sided with quayle and most republicans to 
kill a sixmonth extension of the amnesty period for illegal 
immigrants 
quayle voted for the nomination of robert bork to the supreme 
court bentsen voted with the senate majority to reject it 
the republican led a successful fight in 1986 to win 
confirmation of daniel manion to a seat on a federal appeals bench 
in indiana critics had challenged the conservative lawyers 
credentials bentsen voted against manion 
quayle says he opposes abortion except to save a mothers life 
and he has voted for an antiabortion constitutional amendment and 
against federal funding of abortions bentsen also says he 
personally opposes abortion and federal funding except in cases of 
rape incest or to save a mothers life but he has often voted 
against restrictions on funding and has voted against a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortion 
the centrist bentsen got identical ratings from the aflcio and 
the american conservative union in 1986 50 percent from each 
quayle got a grade of 82 percent from the conservative group but 
only an 8 percent from the labor federation

if pinocchio were running for president hed 
have a mighty long nose 
evasions and distortions seem to be standard fare both on the 
campaign trail and when the candidates come together to debate 
a case in point 
democrat michael dukakis said in last sundays debate that 
george bushs administration had cut and slashed and butchered 
nutrition and education programs and hurt kids all over this 
country he charged it has cut federal aid to education has 
cut pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity 
on youngsters all over this country 
bush who says he wants to be the education president shot 
back the fact happens to be that education spending is up by the 
federal government it is up not down 
the fact is that the us department of educations budget has 
grown since 1981 from 15 billion to nearly 21 billion but it is 
no thanks to reagan who sought repeatedly to slash up to 5 
billion from education 
the pell grant budget grew from 24 billion in 198081 to 37 
billion for 198788 the college board says total federal student 
aid including loans has grown from 144 billion to 184 
billion a 28 percent increase but after inflation the aid is 
actually down 4 percent 
education groups and democrats in congress say that although 
they beat back most of the reagan cuts the education budget has 
lost ground to inflation 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif the chairman of the house 
education and labor committee said bushs statement was at best 
very misleading 
in the debate bush while attacking dukakis national health 
insurance plans suggested that he himself would permit people to 
buy into medicaid and he promised full enforcement of the 
catastrophic health insurance 
but he has not said how his medicaid suggestion would work and 
the catastrophic health insurance he mentioned is only for the 
elderly or disabled workers on medicare 
bush frequently attacks dukakis record as governor of 
massachusetts accusing him of presiding over the massachusetts 
mirage and not the massachusetts miracle that the democrat 
boasts about 
bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana have 
depicted massachusetts as a veritable economic basket case ranking 
40th out of the 50 states in job growth having lost 36400 
manufacturing jobs since 1982 and having piled up a 74 billion 
debt more debt than all previous governors of massachusetts 
combined quayle said 
dukakis economics adviser lawrence h summers charged that 
bush has shown an astonishing disregard for even the most basic 
economic arithmetic 
total employment in massachusetts has grown by more than 400000 
since 1983 and the states 33 percent unemployment rate is the 
lowest of the big industrial states 
although massachusetts encountered trouble balancing its budget 
this year so did other states in the wake of last years sweeping 
changes in the federal tax code it has kept its high bond rating 
and moodys investors service says its economy remains among the 
strongest in the country 
the states current debt is actually 39 billion not 74 
billion 
in their sept 25 debate asked about dukakis charge that bush 
never met a weapons system that you didnt like the vice 
president replied i can tell him some im against a6f for 
example divad and i can go on and on i mean theres plenty 
of them that i oppose 
it turned out that the a6f was a new version of an existing navy 
bomber killed by congress last year as too expensive and the 
divad or sgt york gun was an antiaircraft weapon scrapped by 
thensecretary of defense caspar weinberger in 1985 
dukakis for his part under fire from bush for once supporting 
a nuclear freeze said in their debate back in the spring of 
1982 mr bush was a lot more sympathetic to the freeze than he 
seems to be today 
the dukakis campaign cited a bush speech in april 1982 warning 
against partisan demagoguery in the debate over nuclear weapons 
but bush also reiterated reagan administration arguments that a 
freeze would lock in place soviet missile superiority in europe 
bush helped line up support among the allies in europe for the us 
negotiating position that eventually helped produce the 
intermediate nuclear forces treaty with the soviets

president mikhail s gorbachevs sudden overhaul 
of the kremlin power structure reinvigorates his reform drive and 
signals his determination to best the bureaucracy he blames for 
slowing him down 
the soviet leaders swiftly executed power play friday and 
saturday elevated him to the presidency put him in charge of the 
government as well as the ruling communist party and left the 
kremlin with no clear no 2 
in actionpacked toplevel meetings gorbachev practically 
established a mandatory retirement age by pushing all but one 
septuagenarian off the partys ruling politburo and sent an 
unmistakable message through the vast soviet bureaucracy that he 
expects a similar pruning of dead wood at all levels 
at the same time by easing the 79yearold president andrei a 
gromyko into retirement with praise and a televised swan song he 
opened the way for soviet officials to leave office gracefully a 
necessary prelude to the institution of fixed terms of office for 
party and government officials 
the sole survivor from the old guard is vladimir v 
shcherbitsky 70 whose power base built during 16 years as 
ukrainian party boss apparently continues to insulate him from 
gorbachevs campaign to replace old blood with new 
the new face in the 12man politburo vadim a medvedev 59 was 
catapaulted over eight candidate or nonvoting politburo members 
to full voting status he was given responsibility for ideology 
which by previous custom would make him second to gorbachev 
medvedev an economist regarded by western analysts as a 
proponent of radical economic reform and a member of gorbachevs 
perestroika brain trust will share equal rank with five other 
party commission chiefs four of them strong gorbachev supporters 
and reformists 
it was certainly spectacular to jump him into the senior 
rank said one senior western diplomat speaking on condition he 
not be identified 
it was even more meteoric than the rise of another gorbachev 
confidant alexandr n yakovlev who spent only six months as a 
candidate before rising to full membership on the ruling politburo 
last year 
one western analyst also speaking anonymously cited the 
historical importance of ideology in the communist system he 
predicted medvedev would be charged with redefining socialism to 
permit gorbachev to introduce market forces in the economy without 
violating the tenets of prevailing communist political thought 
the same source said giving former no 2 yegor k ligachev 
responsibility for the farm sector of the economy is the start of 
the process of easing him out 
ligachev widely viewed as gorbachevs principal conservative 
rival nonetheless is moving to a field the reformminded soviet 
leader considers central to his campaign to improve soviet living 
standards and it is not yet clear how the new agriculture chief 
will execute gorbachevs proposals to reinstitute family farming 
diplomats have noted that ligachev has spoken often about farm 
problems in recent months and the 67yearold former ideology 
chief has boasted of his record in improving food production during 
his years as a regional party boss in central siberia 
during a stunning televised putdown of former gorbachev protege 
boris yeltsin last june ligachev told the national party 
conference his old region had been selfsufficient in food for ten 
years whereas the district where you boris worked for nine 
years now has food rationing 
the suddenness of gorbachevs move was not explained it served 
as a reminder that his encouragement of open discussion of problems 
and more democratic electoral procedures have done little to lift 
the lid of near total secrecy that shrouds the actions at the top 
of the soviet power structure 
one diplomatic source said gorbachevs key decisions may have 
been approved at an unannounced politburo meeting on monday the 
party chief then hastily summoned the 300member communist party 
central committee and 1500member supreme soviet or parliament 
to moscow to ratify his choices before his plans could unravel 
ligachev the source said was on vacation outside of moscow for 
about two weeks and apparently did not attend the monday session 
but the report could not be confirmed and the source himself 
expressed some doubt about its accuracy 
gorbachev is a master of surprise observed the longtime 
analyst of soviet affairs he pulls rabbits out of the hat with 
disturbing frequency

students on saturday defied a strict ban 
on public gatherings and gave antigovernment speeches in the 
capital but the speakers and listeners quickly scattered when 
security forces showed up 
staterun radio rangoon said troops shot to death six people 
that brought to about 430 the official death toll since hardline 
gen saw maung staged a coup sept 18 diplomats say the death toll 
is much higher 
in some of the first displays of defiance since the coup about 
10 students stood atop a parked truck and delivered speeches 
witnesses said about five students attempted to stage a similar act 
of defiance nearby 
but in stark contrast to earlier mass demonstrations that led to 
violence with heavily armed troops both speakers and listeners 
fled the scene quickly as security men arrived 
radio rangoon said five people were killed while trying to 
pilfer two government warehouses it said a gambler was shot as 
security personnel dispersed a group of gamblers in central rangoon 
soldiers using loudspeakers asked the capitals residents to 
surrender all illegal weapons and looted material and urged parents 
to prevent children from going astray for fear of arrest 
the plea was aimed at stopping an exodus of young people toward 
the thaiburmese border where students are linking up with 
minority rebels who are also fighting the central government 
some of those fleeing to the border said they saw troops line up 
antigovernment protesters and shoot them but military authorities 
said they had no intention of arresting students 
students were at the forefront of massive demonstrations that 
failed to topple 26 years of authoritarian rule instituted by ne 
win 
ne win resigned in july and was replaced by sein lwin a 
hardline military man he too resigned after massive 
antigovernment protests and was replaced by maung maung a 
civilian who was ousted by saw maung 
over a public address system soldiers told residents to turn in 
all weapons previously announced as illegal these include firearms 
as well as crude homemade weapons like slingshots that fire darts 
known as jinglees the soldiers promised that no action would 
be taken against those who surrendered material looted from 
government warehouses 
shoppers were seen in downtown rangoon in fairly large numbers 
although the capitals busy and colorful street life has sharply 
diminished due to a shortage of money lack of fuel for vehicles 
and a ban on the once ubiquitous street vendors 
the government ordered all civil servants and workers in burmas 
staterun factories to return to their jobs monday or face 
dismissal most government employees have been on strike since aug

president reagan has air force one george 
bush has air force two michael dukakis has sky pig 
that inelegant and unofficial name has stuck as the campaigns 
handle for the democratic presidential nominees chartered campaign 
jet the name has even appeared on a printed campaign schedule 
the plane is a presidential airways boeing 737 an aging 
relatively small jetliner that dukakis has used since republican 
bob dole faded from the presidential race in the early spring and 
relinquished it 
dukakis by all accounts has grown attached to the familiar 
plane even though to some aboard it no longer seems adequate for 
a presidential campaign 
its our plane of choice said top aide nick mitropoulos 
the question is why 
at this stage of past campaigns presidential nominees were 
traveling in boeing 727s or their equivalent larger sleeker 
aircraft with more seats and longer range 
sky pig is unable to fly coasttocoast without a refueling 
stop it has seating for only about 100 compared to 130 or more 
for a 727 sometimes luggage has to be loaded onto a larger second 
plane that follows so the 737 can keep within takeoff and landing 
limits 
and sky pig has its idiosyncracies like a tendency to drip 
water from the ceiling through condensation on hot days it has no 
facilities for heating food 
the name was coined by network television crews who have 
accompanied the candidate for months on its lumbering takeoff 
rolls they sometimes yell encouragement up pig up theres 
even a song to the tune of the 1960s rock song wild thing it 
goes sky pig you make my heart sink 
the second plane an even older 727 follows sky pig carrying 
the spillover of staff reporters secret service agents and 
television crews and producers but because its faster dukakis 
sometimes switches to the american trans air plane to save time on 
a trip across the continent 
still he always returns to the familiar plane 
press secretary dayton duncan said dukakis simply likes the 
plane 
he is comfortable sitting in first class seats in the front 
row behind him it is more crowded 
campaign insiders say he also likes the name presidential 
airways on the side of the aircraft 
the regular crew of flight attendants sometimes come along to 
his campaign events 
they always have aboard a box of raisin bran cereal dukakis 
favorite and they keep a supply of orange crush the candidates 
soda of choice 
he seems puzzled that anyone would want to dump the pig 
well weve been on this plane for a long time he said a 
long time

the psychedelic drug lsd is 50 years old this 
year and the swiss chemist who discovered the nowillegal drug 
that influenced a generation is trying to help raise money to 
spruce up its image 
albert hofmann made the first batch of lysergic acid 
diethylamide25 in 1938 but it wasnt until april 19 1943 that 
he took the first lsd trip by accident 
some trace entered my body he said i dont know by which 
way maybe a drop of the solution came on my fingers 
while riding his bicycle home from the lab hofmann started to 
feel like he was losing his mind 
but as the dosage dissipated he said he started to enjoy the 
experience then i realized it was an important discovery 
the mindaltering drug eventually fueled millions of trips and 
inspired a new wave of poets and musicians before a government ban 
on lsd filled the streets with rivers of bad acid 
hofmann 82 is touring southern california to raise money for a 
foundation that is seeking to improve lsds image and hopes to 
build a los angeles library in his name dedicated to lsd and the 
psychedelic movement 
dr oscar janiger a professor at the university of california 
irvine who has taken the drug 13 times is the founder of the 
albert hofmann foundation 
he said his research between 1954 and 1962 on lsd and creativity 
showed the drug has important scientific applications 
it was a very valuable tool because it allowed us to make some 
inferences about how brain chemistry works and how the mind really 
functions in perceiving things around us said janiger it was 
a very important adjunct to neuroscientific research and it was 
used in that way 
the foundations board of advisers include poet allen ginsberg 
who first took lsd in a 1959 government experiment ram dass once 
known as harvard professor richard alpert neuroscientist john 
lilly and laura huxley widow of author aldous huxley 
janiger envisions the library as a world information center 
for the study of inner space complete with lectures seminars 
workshops and a newsletter 
not everyone is as enthusiastic about the library as janiger 
if it is strictly a research thing you cant have enough of 
that said michael pavlick head of the drug enforcement 
administrations dangerous drug unit in washington but with the 
people involved i hope they are not going to glorify it

protesters aiming to shut down atlanta abortion 
clinics face a tougher less hospitable police force in their 
planned repeat this week of the summer blitz that landed more than 
750 of them in jail 
organizers say they expect hundreds of demonstrators for the 
planned weeklong protest they say theyll find out where 
abortions are being done and try to stop them and that those 
arrested were once again being asked to refuse to give their names 
to authorities 
police plan to be ready and vow to keep the clinics open 
theyre going to see a different atlanta police department 
this week said liaison officer richard hyde were tired of 
getting on our knees and asking grown men and women to get on the 
bus 
atlanta police were fairly lenient during the summer 
demonstrations which began during the democratic national 
convention carrying protesters gently away from the clinics 
we know how to move a person from point a to point b without 
putting him on a stretcher said police maj kenneth burnette in 
charge of the atlanta precinct where some of the clinics are 
located he said the demonstrators violate constitutional rights of 
women who seek a legally available service 
this time theyre going to go to jail and theyre going to be 
treated like criminals burnette said 
advocates of legalized abortion are also preparing 
counterdemonstrations and vigils and are training escorts to take 
women wanting abortions through the lines of demonstrators at the 
clinics 
protest organizers accused the police of threatening violence as 
an intimidation 
we are afraid of what the police are planning to do 
operation rescue official joseph foreman said friday 
also friday the city asked a fulton county superior court to 
declare the demonstrators public nuisances and restrain them from 
blocking clinic entrances or coming within 15 feet of anyone 
entering or leaving a clinic the court did not immediately rule on 
the request 
juli loesch of eire pa spokeswoman for operation rescue said 
the new yorkbased antiabortion group is expecting people in the 
heavy hundreds to come to atlanta and there will be atlanta 
people too 
well do what we did last time we will find out in advance 
which clinics are having abortions on a given day these are not 
symbolic actions we are trying to stop abortions from happening 
organizers say they plan to end this string of atlanta sitins 
friday 
the first operation rescue protest began on the second day of 
the july democratic convention and the demonstrations continued 
long after the democrats left through the summer atlanta police 
arrested 765 demonstrators at 17 sitins before the protests 
slacked off in september 
most of those arrested did not carry identification and gave 
authorities aliases of baby john doe or baby jane doe 
making it impossible for police to free them on bond the aliases 
protesters said were to symbolize their link to what they consider 
to be the anonymous victims of abortion 
several demonstrators spent a month or more in jail and three 
were still there saturday including two men who have spent more 
than two months in jail ms loesch said those who could take the 
time to stay in jail would be encouraged to use the same noname 
tactic this week 
arrests and jail expenses in the summer protests came to about 
500000 for the city of atlanta which gradually toughened its 
stance against the protests police started dragging protestors to 
jailbound buses instead of carrying them vans of protesters en 
route to targeted clinics were given traffic tickets the 
convention expedient of freeing identified demonstrators on 
recognizance bonds ended and the courts began demanding cash or 
surety bonds of up to 2000 
nationwide ms loesch said 6364 operation rescue protesters 
have been arrested in about 30 cities this year the group 
maintains that its actions have persuaded about 370 women not to 
have abortions

it was so bad you couldnt even see the road out here said 
her colleague bonnie martakis 
theyre smaller than my fingernail ms abshier said we 
wonder what their destination is 
although the invading horde looked like frogs close inspections 
showed they were baby toads a byproduct of flooding in parts of

president reagan saying that all the 
work is done announced today that hed signed all 13 spending 
bills that fund the federal government 
im happy to report that today oct 1 marks the beginning of 
the fiscal year and at this hour for the first time in years all 
the governments budgetary work is done reagan announced in his 
weekly radio address 
the last of the governments 13 appropriations bill have been 
delivered to me and i have signed them reagan said in his 
address from the oval office 
the president noted that it was touch and go for a while 
in a statement released by the white house reagan lauded the 
lawmakers 
congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13 
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year they worked long 
and hard to meet this years deadline the statement said 
with just three minutes to spare after a frantic daylong 
session congress wrapped up its work on all 13 appropriations 
bills before the new fiscal year began this morning 
the achievement marked the first time since 1976 that congress 
has passed separately all the appropriations bills which keep 
federal agencies functioning before the beginning of the new 
fiscal year 
we just barely beat the midnight deadline but we did 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva told his colleagues 
early today minutes after they agreed to house language on a 143 
billion foreign aid measure we can all feel good about that 
reagan said hed signed the six remaining appropriations 
measures early today he received a bill for the commerce justice 
and state departments on tuesday and signed a seventh spending 
bill a 108 billion measure for transportation earlier friday 
reagan had hoped to sign the last of the bills friday night upon 
returning to the white house from chicago but they had not been 
cleared by congress by the time the president retired for the 
evening 
at three minutes before midnight friday senators accepted by 
voice vote house language on the foreign aid measure finishing a 
marathon day in which congress cleared five appropriations bills 
two minutes later a puffing house clerk ran into the senate 
chamber carrying the house legislation technically sealing the 
agreement reached by the vote minutes earlier 
budget fights between congress and the president have been the 
rule since 1976 resulting in some or all of the spending measures 
being wrapped together presidents object to that because as the 
bills grow to cover more and more federal agencies the political 
consequences of a veto become more serious 
last year saw reagan sign a single bill covering all federal 
agencies worth more than 600 billion he promised to veto anything 
ressembling it this year and lawmakers strove from the beginning of 
the year to avoid a replay 
there would have been little discernible immediate impact if the 
spending bills were not completed friday few federal employees 
work on weekends and essential workers like air traffic 
controllers and soldiers are required to report anyway 
had reagan signed all the bills before midnight it would have 
been the first time since 1948 that all appropriations bills were 
enacted before the start of the new fiscal year 
but they were not ready when the president shortly before 11 
pm returned to the white house where a formal signing ceremony 
had been scheduled for the oval office but then canceled 
reagan decided to criticize the lawmakers instead 
i had hoped that we could mark the end of the 
dogatemyhomework era of congressional budgetry but it was not 
to be he told reporters 
the other bills lawmakers finished friday were measures 
providing 282 billion for defense 466 billion for agriculture 
143 billion for foreign aid 32 billion for the district of 
columbia and 18 billion for congress own coffers 
as lawmakers neared the end of their work they gave two 
standing ovations to sen john stennis dmiss the 87yearold 
chairman of the senate appropriations committee who is retiring 
from the senate after this year 
im proud but its not really the chairman whos entitled to 
the credit the courtly mississippian said

mikhail s gorbachev grasped the top government 
and communist party authority in his own hands saturday succeeding 
president andrei a gromyko to climax a breathtaking twoday 
assault on the kremlins old guard 
the 1500member supreme soviet unanimously elected gorbachev 
president just 25 hours after a hasty gathering of the communist 
party central committee streamlined the party apparatus and made 
the biggest personnel changes since gorbachev became party leader 
3 years ago 
the kremlin shakeup fuels gorbachevs drive to restructure the 
soviet economy and government and signals his determination to 
dominate the entrenched bureaucracy he blames for slowing him down 
a somber gorbachev promised the supreme soviet the nominal 
parliament that government bodies will take on a greater role in 
everyday management of the country while the communist party 
confines itself to policy matters 
the soviets government councils must become the highest 
authority on their territory and eliminate the shortcomings of 
stagnation gorbachev said the party will facilitate the 
enhancement of the role of the soviets 
the soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden of 
state work he said in a brief address after the vote as the 
situation changes we must change accordingly 
in its 42minute session the supreme soviet also approved 
without debate or dissent the selection of a new kgb chief career 
officer vladimir kryuchkov and gorbachevs recommendation for a 
new vice president anatoly lukyanov 
on friday gromyko retired from the 12man ruling politburo the 
partys policymaking central committee also removed another aging 
full member of the politburo and two candidate or nonvoting 
members and reorganized the powerful central committee secretariat 
gorbachev installed supporters in key central committee jobs and 
appeared to demote yegor k ligachev said to be a conservative 
politburo rival by putting him in charge of agriculture 
the creamcolored walls of the supreme soviet echoed in 
thunderous applause at the end of the 79yearold gromykos 
farewell address in which he urged party unity and thanked the 
deputies for their faith in him 
gromyko a communist party and government stalwart from the time 
of stalin through the first several years of gorbachevs reforms 
served 28 years as foreign minister before being elevated to the 
largely ceremonial presidency in july 1985 four months after 
gorbachev took power 
the star of socialism since october 1917 has constantly shined 
and given light he said thank you comrade deputies for the 
trust youve granted me in the past and now i have very deep 
respect for it he said 
gromyko then returned to his seat on the dais facing the 
deputies and sat expressionless abstaining from the vote that 
removed him from office 
when selected party leader in march 1985 gorbachev chose not to 
take the top government job as his predecessors had he held a 
position as a member of the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
countrys highest executive body that gromyko headed that gave 
gorbachev sufficient ceremonial standing to conduct affairs of 
state 
but in june the soviet leader proposed creation of a new more 
powerful presidency in line with his efforts to strengthen the 
government and limit the communist partys involvement in 
daytoday management 
gorbachev proposed that the new president be chosen by a 
reorganized parliament 
communist party officials have instructed the supreme soviet to 
make the reforms between october and next spring it was uncertain 
how gorbachevs sudden assumption of government power affected 
those plans 
that may become more certain at another meeting of the supreme 
soviet scheduled for the end of the month 
the unification of top party and government jobs also raised an 
issue that was debated hotly at the june party conference 
gorbachev urged then that party leaders be chosen heads of their 
local soviets as well he said that would enhance the status of the 
soviets and make party leaders more accountable to the people 
other officials argued that such a system only continues the 
partys longtime interference in everyday government affairs 
it was not known why gorbachev acted so suddenly to make all but 
two of the 12 full and eight candidate members of the politburo his 
appointees 
a diplomatic source said the key decisions may have been 
approved at an unannounced politburo meeting on monday 
the sudden call for a gathering of the 300 members of the 
central committee and the supreme soviet brought foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze defense minister dmitri t yazov and other 
officials scurrying home from abroad 
illustrating the suddenness of the changes the tass news agency 
reported saturday that a visit to north korea planned by gromyko as 
soviet head of state for the middle of october was postponed the 
visit was announced monday in the government newspaper izvestia

thirty years ago pat johnson recalls the 
windows rattled and knickknacks skittered about rousing her from 
sleep when she and her family ventured out into the cool fog they 
saw a fire a mile away downtown 
three separate explosions had distroyed her high school 
climaxing two years of race riots and tension in this otherwise 
quiet town in mountainous eastern tennessee 
as johnson and others crept toward the heaps of bricks and 
mangled lumber and duct work she zeroed in on the rippedapart 
steel lockers one of them hers and the wildly flung books 
it was so scary you just thought what if theyd done it when 
people were there said ms johnson 45 who was in the ninth 
grade then and now works for the clinton police department 
clinton high school was one of the first public schools in the 
south to be desegregated under court order 
eleanor davis who taught english at the school says the oct 
5 1958 bombing was an ugly climax that ironically drew together 
townsfolk who had splintered into factions and spat insults at each 
other over the issues of integration and law and order 
there were divorces over the question of sending the kids to 
the school mrs davis said in a recent interview we were 
divided there were all these hurt feelings around 
that was one thing the bombing did all factions came 
together we didnt want anyone to destroy our schools she said 
the us supreme court in 1954 ruled that segregated public 
schools were unconstitutional in august 1956 clinton high was 
ordered to admit blacks 
the violence began and the small police force did little to 
stop it bombs exploded in blacks yards those who wanted to obey 
the law even if they didnt agree with it found their cars 
overturned 
on enrollment day in the fall of 1956 a dozen black students 
who previously had been bused to an allblack school in knoxville 
walked past jeering bystanders to the red brick building followed 
by reporters photographers and the national guard 
the students both blacks and whites were quiet and 
ruleabiding although the races didnt mingle socially in the 
school johnson recalls 
they more or less stayed to themselves and we stayed to 
ourselves we didnt talk to each other she said inside the 
school we didnt have any problem it was the adults from the 
outside 
gov frank clement eventually called in the national guard and 
100 state troopers but not until after numerous riots and small 
bombings and incidents such as the beating of a baptist minister 
who escorted black children through a crowd of protesters at the 
schools front door 
johnson remembers walking to school under the gaze of armed 
guardsmen in their jeeps she also recalls the racescored plight 
of her nextdoor neighbors 
they had an adopted child who had dark skin but was not black 
they were afraid even to let her go outside she said they let 
her hide on the floor of their car when they went out to get 
groceries 
the tension eased in the wake of the 1958 bombing but nobody 
was ever arrested the fbi essentially dropped its investigation 
when two main suspects died 
the day after the explosions the schools 800 students picked 
their way through the piles of brick and shards of glass to gather 
in the gymnasium and learn what to do next 
the same week they began their orderly bus rides to linden 
elementary school in alreadyintegrated oak ridge where they sat 
in tiny desks and drank from kneehigh water fountains until a new 
clinton school was built 
we didnt miss a day of school because of the bombing said 
mrs davis

army troops and police reported an 
uneasy calm in two southern cities saturday one day after ethnic 
violence left at least 172 people dead 
officials said sindhi nationalists in apparently coordinated 
attacks fired friday from moving cars on mohajir immigrants in 
buses and marketplaces killing at least 140 in hyderabad and 32 in 
karachi 
area hospitals however reported a higher toll 217 fatalities 
and 400 injuries including several sindhis killed in retaliatory 
shootings saturday by mohajirs who set up roadblocks 
army troops eventually drove the rioters from the streets of 
karachi by nightfall 
the situation is returning to normal chief minister akhtar 
ali kazi the top executive of sind province said in a statement 
both hyderabad and karachi pakistans largest city with 8 
million residents have been the scene of bloody ethnic clashes 
between mohajirs and sindhi separatists who want sind province to 
be independent of pakistan 
the 107 million people of this moslem nation carved out of 
predominantly hindu india at the end of british rule in 1947 form 
a patchwork of rival ethnic groups stretching south from the 
himalayas to the indian ocean 
pakistan officially recognizes nationalities of its four 
provinces the pathans of the northwest province bordering 
afghanistan the baluchis of arid baluchistan the punjabis of 
punjab in the east and the sindhis of sind province in the south 
but the weekend massacre involved a fifth major group the 
mohajirs who immigrated mostly from india and in the last decade 
from bangladesh 
the increase in mohajirs especially in sind province has led 
to repeated clashes in recent years with the sindhis pathans and 
punjabis 
the most militant sindhis are members of the jeay sindhi 
movement which is campaigning for an independent state of 
sindhudesh 
the mohajirs who dominate the provinces cities have formed 
the mohajir quami movement to press for official recognition as a 
fifth nationality 
ali hassan a hyderabad resident who saw the violence told the 
associated press by telephone it was hell 
the markets were full of people when bullets were sprayed 
from a moving car there was panic and people started running for 
shelter hassan said 
hassan said about 10 cars and jeeps opened fire in several 
different parts of the city at public gatherings a wedding 
movie houses and bus stops 
it was a very wellplanned attack and executed with 
perfection hassan said 
officials said the hyderabad massacre was the worst in history 
for the city of 1 million 
the highest death toll ever reported previously in that city was 
18 in riots last july that followed an unsuccessful attempt by 
sindhi student radicals to assassinate mohajir mayor aftab sheikh 
clashes between mohajirs and pathans started in karachi in 1985 
over a fatal traffic accident riots continued for nearly six weeks 
and left about 60 dead 
the worst violence in pakistans history was in late 1986 when 
the two groups battled almost daily for months authorities said 
about 200 people died but unofficial estimates were much higher

as hundreds of nasa 
workers prepare for the next shuttle launch at kennedy space center 
in florida a small air force team is trying to keep a neverused 
west coast shuttle launchpad from rusting away 
the 35 billion pad standing next to the pacific ocean on the 
central california coast was intended to give the air force a way 
to launch shuttles into polar orbit in which they circle the 
globe north to south instead of east to west 
the air force still needs to put its satellites into polar 
orbits because that is the path best suited for satellites to spy 
on the soviet union but not necessarily with the shuttle the 
explosion of the challenger on jan 28 1986 convinced the air 
force that it should not rely on the shuttle but should turn to 
unmanned expendable rockets to launch its satellites 
the decision halted a mammoth effort begun in 1979 building 
enormous movable structures as well as a harbor it also guaranteed 
that a shuttle will not be launched from vandenberg for many years 
if ever 
one casualty was the nearby coastal community of lompoc which 
was forced to trade shuttle launches for flower festivals as its 
main tourist attraction 
shuttle launches were expected to draw throngs of people to the 
scenic community of 32000 that is surrounded by fields of flowers 
but when it became clear a shuttle might never be launched from 
vandenberg lompoc pinned its hopes for the future on the towns 
distinction as producer of more than half of the worlds flower 
seeds 
after air force secretary edward c aldridge declared in july 
1986 that sole reliance on the shuttle was a major mistake for 
this country work on space launch complex 6 slowed 
the complex was dropped into minimum facility caretaker 
status a level costing 40 million to 50 million annually and 
requiring four years to reactivate 
the air force soon downgraded the pad again and began 
mothballing the estimate of how long it would take to reactivate 
slipped to the indefinite 
weve never put a number on it but its well over four 
years said lt col dennis masson director of the engineering 
and facilities management launch facility program office i would 
guess personally youre probably talking about six years easily 
one of the premises of mothball status was that much of the 
equipment would be sent to nasa and elsewhere and masson has been 
doing that giving away everything from computers to screwdrivers 
the navy got mv independence a small ship that would have 
retrieved expended booster rockets from the pacific ocean and 
returned them to a small harbor on the shore of the 154squaremile 
base 
nearly 22000 components worth about 85 million have been given 
away 75 million to nasa and about 10 million to the navy and 
other air force agencies 
we know for instance when we ever start launching shuttles 
here i think were going to have a whole new computer system so 
our computers are basically not worth anything to us masson said 
the change to a new computer system means the pad will be far 
from ready if it is needed 
we could not just walk in and turn the buttons on masson 
said wed have to go through a rather rigorous procurement 
process 
the air force also would have to bring the launch site into step 
with the current engineering of the space shuttle system nasa has 
made changes to the orbiter and ground equipment since the mothball 
decision and because most of vandenbergs engineers have left new 
engineers would have to be brought in to assess the impact of the 
changes on the launch site that would add two or three years to 
the reactivation process masson said 
at the peak of construction there were 4300 workers in october 
1986 when the site was put in minimum facility caretaker 
status there were about 2100 workers those plus 400 more from 
kennedy space center would have been needed for launches 
keeping the system in mothballs will cost 10 million annually 
and require 40 or 50 workers about half of them painters and paint 
chippers layoffs and attrition have reduced the work force to 250 
so far 
much of the maintenance will be inspections of the systems and 
protection of enormously expensive items such as the 27story 
8000ton mobile service tower 
it would cost us a fortune something in the area of over a 
hundred million dollars to replace that particular structure 
masson said

federal officials called off a nationwide 
alert saturday after the nuclear reactor from a soviet military spy 
satellite ejected into high orbit obviating the danger of 
radioactive debris raining to earth 
the emergency is over said peg maloy spokeswoman for the 
federal emergency management agency which had coordinated 
extensive preparations to deal with any danger that might be posed 
by the satellite kosmos 1900 
she said pieces of the satellite had begun disintegrating in the 
earths atmosphere but added its just an ordinary drop 
theres no nuclear radiation involved 
right now everyone is breathing a real sigh of relief ms 
maloy said 
maj alex mondragon a spokesman at the us space commands 
space surveillance center in cheyenne mountain colo said the 
center is now tracking multiple objects in orbit apparently 
associated with a change in status in kosmos 1900 
there is debris in low orbit previously associated with kosmos 
1900 and now there is also new debris in a much higher orbit the 
additional debris is being catalogued and monitored by the us 
space command but preliminary analysis indicates that the object 
in higher orbit would remain there for many years he said 
mondragon said that the larger previously untracked object is 
currently assessed to be the reactor section with associated 
debris he said the reactor was orbiting the earth every 993 
minutes at an altitude of about 433 miles to 476 miles 
one piece of kosmos 1900 he said came down saturday morning 
over the atlantic ocean off the northwest coast of africa while 
another piece was orbiting at an altitude of about 91 miles its 
a small enough piece that we expect it to burn up he said 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass confirmed that kosmos 
1900 had shut down its reactor and separated with it when an 
automatic safety system began functioning 
the remaining part of the satellite instrument compartment 
which will shortly burn up in the dense layers of the atmosphere 
poses no radiation danger tass said 
earlier civil defense officials working with 15 other federal 
departments and agencies had made preparations to open an 
emergency center at the department of health and human services in 
washington and to help coordinate state and local efforts 
the soviet communist party newspaper pravda has called kosmos 
1900 a research satellite to observe the surface of oceans but 
us experts say it is part of the rorsat series the soviets use to 
track us warships 
rorsat carries a radarimaging device that beams radar waves to 
earth then analyzes the return signal to spot objects as small as 
destroyers the nuclear reactor provides the enormous power needed 
for the radar 
the satellite was designed to automatically fire rocket engines 
twice a week to correct a degrading orbit western experts noticed 
in april that the rockets were not firing and after reports 
appeared in the us and british media the soviets acknowledged 
that they had lost radio contact with kosmos 1900 
the soviets issued contradictory statements within the past week 
on when they lost radio contact with the satellite the soviet 
atomic energy committee statement said that in april 1988 radio 
communication with this satellite was interrupted 
but the communist party newspaper pravda ran an article by prof 
v serbin on thursday saying that radio communications with it 
stopped last june 
two earlier rorsat satellites have fallen from orbit the first 
was kosmos 954 which spewed radioactive flakes over 20000 square 
miles of northwestern canada on jan 24 1978 
the soviets redesigned the satellite and most subsequent 
rorsats ejected their nuclear reactors into a graveyard orbit 
600 miles above the earth while the satellites themselves largely 
burned up on reentry said oberg 
that system failed on kosmos 1402 which splashed into the 
indian ocean on feb 7 1983 however a backup system apparently 
ejected the nuclear reactor from the main body of the satellite and 
it disintegrated into dust on reentry according to american 
scientists 
robert leifer of the us energy departments environmental 
measurements laboratory wrote in the october 1987 edition of 
science magazine that the reactor disintegrated in the stratosphere 
47 miles over the indian ocean 
samples collected by a high altitude balloon accounted for 97 
pounds of the 110 pounds of uranium and related isotopes that 
rorsat is thought to have carried wrote leifer 
that means that radioactive dust settled slowly out of the 
atmosphere in concentrations too thin to endanger human life he 
said 
after kosmos 1900 falls the soviets will have no rorsats in 
orbit a condition that prevails about half the time said oberg 
the united states has considered launching satellites with 
nuclear reactors aboard but has never done so and it not believed 
to have a radarimaging satellite in orbit

here is the text of andrei a gromykos farewell 
speech to saturdays session of the supreme soviet which replaced 
him as soviet president the speech was translated by the 
associated press 
i would like to express my gratitude to the general secretary of 
the central committee of the communist party mikhail sergeyevich 
gorbachev for everything he said yesterday at the plenum of the 
central committee while addressing me for the evaluation of my 
work which included my work as chairman of the presidium of the 
supreme soviet the central committee plenum supported my request 
to resign due to age 
what else can i say my work is wellknown nearly all the 
time starting with my appointment to the diplomatic service this 
work has been conducted in full view the length of my service is 
nearly half a century i express deep gratitude to you comrade 
deputies for our work together in these first years of the great 
restructuring 
all our people the party of communists are busy with the 
implementation of grandiose plans new tasks arise and the elected 
representatives of the people the deputies must take on the 
modernization of the political system the completion of the 
creation of the social and legal state it will demand tremendous 
effort but the communist party and its central committee are fully 
determined to fulfill the daring and wellfounded program for the 
countrys development 
the enrichment of soviet democracy and openness is a mighty 
source for the soviet people to derive strength for new 
achievements both in domestic life and for the implementation of 
the leninist peace policy in international affairs 
i believe in the tremendous strength of our ideas and 
principles armed with this belief our people traversed the 
difficult but heroic path after the great october revolution we 
all know what sacrificies were made at various stages of history of 
the soviet state but our land of socialism not only survived but 
gained the power to move forward with a sure step 
yes in the history of our country there have been failures 
they are wellknown we justly and surely condemn them but the 
star of socialism has been shining brightly ever since october 
1917 it was kindled in the land of the soviets never to be dimmed 
people today expect the soviets on all levels to contribute to 
perestroika such a contribution is worthy of the grandiose plans 
set by the party 
experience shows that for solving the great tasks that confront 
the country our leninist party needs not only a clear head and 
sturdy shoulders but unity in its ranks as well this necessity has 
been proved by our history since october the unity of the party 
its unity with the people are as necessary for solving our great 
tasks as air is to a human being we have this unity in the central 
committee as well as in the politburo 
surveying our great country i would like to share a feeling 
that is constantly with me confidence in tomorrow what gives me 
this confidence first of all the remarkable people living in the 
country who can solve the most complicated problems second we 
have a wise and sagacious party closely linked to the people 
third the leadership that has been consolidated is worthy of the 
great tasks the country faces at this turning point in the 
development of soviet society and at this turning point in the

a discovery astronaut photographed 
tiny protein crystals saturday that are growing aboard the shuttle 
in an experiment seeking clues for better drugs against aids 
cancer and arthritis 
the crystals if formed perfectly would reveal the proteins 
complex molecular structure a needed step in drug engineering 
without knowing what a protein looks like scientists develop drugs 
in a sort of hitormiss fashion 
crystals can be grown on earth but gravity distorts them and 
they are small scientists have been successful at growing bigger 
and more nearly perfect crystals in zero gravity 
the crystals are expected to grow to about the size of table 
salt grains before discovery returns to earth on monday 
mission specialist george d pinky nelson who is in charge 
of the experiment took photographs of it several times saturday to 
document its various stages it is one of 11 scientific experiments 
aboard discovery 
the experiment consists of several samples of 11 different 
proteins including the enzyme reverse transcriptase once the aids 
virus gets into a human cell it uses the enzyme to take over the 
genetic pattern of the cell and turns the cell into a factory that 
spreads the virus throughout the body 
with a knowledge of the proteins structure researchers would 
have a better chance of someday developing a drug that would stop 
reverse transcriptase from working theoretically stopping the 
aids virus in its tracks 
the aids experiment developed at burroughs wellcome in research 
triangle park nc was approved to fly on the shuttle late this 
summer after nasa officials were convinced there was no threat to 
the astronauts 
dr tom krenitsky of burroughs wellcome said the experiment is 
very promising but he cautioned that even if the test produces 
perfect crystals of reverse transcriptase a new drug could still 
be 10 years away 
the experiments apparatus has 60 chambers that house protein 
solution samples in syringes once in orbit nelson turned a crank 
to extrude the solution and start the growing process a droplet of 
protein hangs from the syringe and the crystals form within 
the drops will be retracted before reentry monday and the entire 
apparatus will be turned over to an investigating team for analysis 
the other proteins in the experiment include elastace and human 
renin elastace is an enzyme involved in the degradation of lung 
tissue in people suffering from emphysema and human renin is 
produced by the kidneys and plays a major role in the chemical 
reaction that controls blood pressure 
dr charles bugg of the university of alabamabirmingham 
principal investigator for the entire protein crystal growth 
experiment said another substance is purine nucleoside 
phophorylase or pnp 
pnp he said is found in large concentrations in the blood and 
chews up anticancer agents injected into patients it also is 
involved in that part of the immune system that rejects tissue 
transplants and in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis

truong chinh a hardline marxist 
ideologue who helped found vietnams communist party and served as 
its leader died from injuries suffered in a fall the vietnam news 
agency said saturday he was 81 
communist literature once lauded chinh as the first builder 
and commander of the vietnam revolution he served twice as the 
communist party chief once in the 1950s and again in 1986 
us government documents described him as vietnams most hated 
leader having the mind of a fanatic french historian bernard 
fall estimated 50000 people were executed in chinhs drive to 
reform the north vietnamese countryside during the 1950s 
the official news agency said chinh died at his hanoi home 
friday of severe hemorrhage more than one hour after an accidental 
fall five days of official mourning begin sunday 
chinh began his political life 63 years ago and was one of the 
last of vietnams old guard revolutionaries he belonged to a 
passing generation of leaders who founded the countrys communist 
party fought four wars and united the nation in 1975 
his death leaves only pham van dong le duc tho and vo nguyen 
giap among a group of near legendary figures who fought the french 
japanese americans and chinese but failed to bring prosperity or 
personal freedoms to vietnam once the wars were won 
except for a brief eclipse after the disastrous land reforms 
when he resigned as communist party chief chinh remained near the 
pinnacle of power from the 1930s he long held the no 2 spot in 
the partys politburo and in 1981 was named chairman of the newly 
created state council the most powerful government organ 
he took over leadership of the party again on july 14 1986 
after the death of another top old guard revolutionary le duan 
chinh was replaced as the partys general secretary in december 
1986 when reformers led by his successor nguyen van linh gained 
the upper hand 
he had since served as an adviser to the party 
the official reason for his resignation was old age and 
declining health but failure to pull vietnam out of serious 
economic problems was widely believed to be the real reason 
chinh made his name as a party organizer and marxist ideologue 
once regarded as prochinese rather than prosoviet he changed 
his name of dang xuan khu to truong chinh meaning long march 
because of his admiration of the epic march of chinese leader mao 
tsetung 
according to his official biography chinh was born in the 
northern province of ha nam ninh began political activities in 
1925 and joined the revolutionary youth league in 1930 he became 
one of the founding members of the indochinese communist party 
like many of his colleagues he was imprisoned by the french 
colonial rulers and at the outbreak of world war ii fled to china 
where he helped organize forces 
under the leadership of ho chi minh they entered hanoi in 
triumph at the end of the war and proclaimed the democratic 
republic of vietnam in 1946 
in the ensuing war against the french chinh directed the 
propaganda machine by 1953 he was second to only uncle hoin 
the power hierarchy 
his stature increased as the united states entered the war in 
south vietnam rather than throwing regular north vietnamese units 
into the conflict he advocated a protracted guerrilla war and 
greater emphasis on political struggle

president reagan signed on saturday the last 
of 13 spending bills for fiscal year 1989 praising congress for 
passing them on schedule and avoiding the perils of pauline 
budget games of previous years 
for the first time in years all the governments budgetary 
work is done reagan said in his weekly radio address 
the last of the governments 13 appropriations bill have been 
delivered to me and i have signed them he said hours after 
congress approved the money to keep federal agencies operating 
the usually rancorous budget process was eased this year because 
congress and the white house had cut deals that virtually 
guaranteed approval of the spending bills even before reagan 
introduced his budget 
lawmakers finished work on the bills minutes ahead of saturdays 
start of the new fiscal year it was the first time since 1976 that 
the house and senate both controlled by democrats had passed the 
bills separately and on time 
congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13 
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year reagan said 
they worked long and hard to meet this years deadline 
reagan said it was touch and go for a while and added i 
hope the last 24 hours proved historic and marked the end of the 
perils of pauline budget games that congress played for so long 
he criticized as minimal the amount of humanitarian aid granted 
the contra rebels of nicaragua and chided congress for its 
approval of a protectionist textile bill that he vetoed earlier 
in the week 
nevertheless simple getting timely congressional action is a 
great achievement so in conclusion let me express again my 
thanks and that of the nation to the members of both houses for 
their conscientiousness in making this historic break with the 
recent past reagan said 
had reagan signed all the bills before midnight as he had hoped 
it would have been the first time since 1948 that all 
appropriations bills were enacted before the start of the new 
fiscal year last year reagan signed a 600 billion catchall 
spending bill but he threatened to exercise his veto if a similar 
measure was put on his desk this year 
reagan signed six appropriations bills saturday including a 
282 billion defense spending bill and a 143 billion foreign aid 
measure the other bills were signed earlier 
house majority leader tom foley dwash said in the democratic 
radio response that this early legislative action on the budget 
has established a discipline that we havent seen in perhaps 40 
years 
easing the way for completion of the 13 spending measures that 
pay federal agencies bills was the summit pact between reagan and 
congressional leaders last november 
in that deal broad spending totals were set for defense 
domestic and foreign aid programs and an agreement was reached 
that there would be no new 1989 taxes that eliminated the 
differences over which many lengthy bloody budget battles have 
been fought and produced a tone that was less confrontational than 
in the past 
the credit should go to that summit agreement we reached last 
year said senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
the usual ferocity over spending priorities was tempered by the 
desire of the administration and congressional democrats to avoid a 
repeat of last years embarrassing budget finale 
the result of yearlong fighting was a 600 billion measure 
covering all federal agencies and promises from reagan and 
congress to avoid that outcome again 
both sides saw the benefit to programs of the government and 
to the orderly functioning of government to rise above any kind of 
political advantage said foley 
there was another element to this years budget process 
this is the year of the big wink the high art of blue smoke 
and mirrors said rep don rostenkowski dill chairman of the 
house ways and means committee last february on the day reagans 
11 trillion budget reached congress 
at the time he was referring to a series of agreements on the 
accounting methods that would be used to measure the federal 
deficit that ensured the red ink would seem smaller than it might 
otherwise 
those accounting formulas will have a helpful impact when it 
comes to determining whether the fiscal 1989 deficit is within the 
146 billion ceiling set in the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
even with those favorable accounting methods the 
administrations office of management and budget estimated on 
thursday that the deficit stood at nearly 1459 billion 
if the deficit should surpass 146 billion when it is measured 
on oct 15 spending would have to be cut acrosstheboard by at 
least 10 billion an amount that would cause political pain for 
lawmakers in an election year

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address giving from the white house oval office on saturday 
my fellow americans in the past few weeks you and i and all 
americans have won some major victories here in washington these 
victories didnt come easily but each will help shape our nation 
in the years ahead 
one of the most important has to do with the federal budget 
only once since 1948 has all of the budgeting of the united states 
government been approved by congress and signed by the president on 
or before the beginning of the fiscal year and too often when the 
budget process has reached an impasse appropriations have been 
dumped into massive continuing resolutions 
the worst of these came along last year congress poured all the 
governments appropriations into a single bill the bill was 1057 
pages long weighed 14 pounds and arrived over two months after 
the fiscal year began 
not even congress knew what was in it 
i said in january that the next time congress pulled such a 
stunt well never again well im happy to report that today 
october 1st marks the beginning of the fiscal year and at this 
hour for the first time in years all the governments budgetary 
work is done 
the last of the governments 13 appropriations bills have been 
delivered to me and i have signed them it was touch and go for a 
while whether we would actually meet the deadline the 
appropriations bill for the district of columbia provided financing 
of abortions long after most other federal abortion financing has 
stopped we said public money should not be used for abortions 
many liberals said it should be we won 
the defense appropriations bill was also a close call as you 
know many liberals are opposed to our strategic defense initiative 
why they would want to deny america a defense against nuclear 
missiles a defense that the soviets have been candid enough to say 
theyre building for themselves why the liberals would want to do 
that i dont know 
they have through various devices restricted how we spent money 
on sdi research and development 
these restrictions could have crippled critical parts of the 
program but early this week we got the restrictions removed from 
all bills and research will go forward to find a way to end the 
nightmare of nuclear terror i hope the last 24hours prove 
historic and mark the end of the perils of pauline budget games 
congress played for so long 
another recent historic accomplishment is passage of a bill 
implementing the uscanada free trade agreement when similar 
legislation is enacted in canada north america will be on its way 
to becoming the worlds largest open market 
thanks in part to our successful policy begun the day george 
bush and i took office of opening markets around the world to 
american goods america is today in the longest peacetime economic 
expansion on record canada is also growing strongly opening our 
mutual border to uninhibited commerce will help that unprecedented 
expansion continue into the next decade and the next century 
this week we won one other major victory in congress and took a 
giant step toward reform in the welfare system that is a trap for 
too many of our fellow citizens 
now ive often said that genuine welfare reform must be geared 
to making people independent of welfare and that means among 
other things that those who receive welfare must be required to 
work too many liberals have fought this idea every step of the 
way but yesterday we prevailed and the welfare reform 
legislation that will arrive on my desk shortly includes a work 
requirement 
even as we can take pride in these great victories a couple of 
other legislative battles continue to rage over the textile bill 
which i vetoed this week and the drug bill 
on the textile bill the problem is that the bill is 
protectionist and would draw foreign retaliation against american 
products with america exporting more than ever protectionism 
means destroying american jobs and i wont allow it 
the housepassed drug bill provides for a federal death penalty 
for drugrelated killings liberals in congress oppose the death 
penalty and other necessary improvements in the law and plan to 
kill the bill in the senate theyve also recently cut funding for 
the federal agencies that enforce our drug laws 
its time the liberals realized that the fight against drugs is 
not peewees big adventure but a serious and dangerous 
business and our law enforcement officers should have all the 
tools they need to do their job 
i urge the senate to follow the houses lead and give america a 
strong drug bill i urge congress to act swiftly this week to 
restore full funding to drug law enforcement 
with your help in the end what is best for the nation will win 
out it has in many ways in the past few days lets hope congress 
will do whats right on the textile and the drug bills 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

president reagan saying i am the same man i 
was when i came to washington contended saturday that his 
beliefs have been vindicated by the success of his superpower 
policies 
in an address at georgetown university reagan said his policies 
have brought about the receding tide of totalitarianism during 
his two terms as president 
the president said hes been steadfast and unapologetic and 
unwilling to accept soviet nuclear superiority the soviet 
occupation of afghanistan or the presence of soviet and cuban 
proxies in angola and nicaragua 
reagan said his principles hadnt swerved at all even though 
some conservatives had been leery about the administrations move 
to ease relations with the soviet union in order to achieve the 
first treaty banning an entire class of nuclear weapons 
contrary to some of the things youve heard i am the same man 
i was when i came to washington i believe the same things i 
believed when i came to washington and i think those beliefs have 
been vindicated by the success of the policies to which we held 
fast reagan said 
yes at every point on the map that the soviets have applied 
pressure weve done all we can to apply pressure against them 
reagan said and now we are seeing a sight many believed they 
would never see in our lifetime the receding tide of 
totalitarianism 
reagan made the unusual weekend appearance at a school to help 
celebrate the bicentennial of the nations oldest catholic 
university accepting an honorary doctorate of humane letters 
reagan spoke on the celebrations theme learning faith and 
freedom 
america is what she is because she is guided by all three 
the president said americans know the truth of those words we 
still believe in our creator we still believe in knowledge we 
still believe in freedom 
the president contended that rulers who enslave and victimize 
the people of the earth are coming to envy americas freedom 
we prosper economically only because people are free free 
not only to speak and read and think but also to create and build 
and barter and sell reagan said

as the congress heads into its final days before adjournment in 
october it seems a good time to reflect on these last two years 
the 100th congress has been a landmark congress guided by the 
historic bipartisan budget summit of november last year congress 
moved constructively and effectively to bring about a signficant 
reduction in the national deficit that so threatens the countrys 
future and the economic security of every individual american 
the congress is determined to continue on this path of reducing 
the federal deficit and moving further toward a balanced budget 
this year we fully complied with the requirements of the 
grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction act but american society 
like the individual american is compassionate and congress as 
the representatives of a compassionate people moved to address a 
series of longstanding needs that our nation could be better poised 
to meet the challenges it faces 
the congressional leadership set a goal last january to pass all 
13 appropriation bills in time for the new fiscal year this will 
avoid the necessity of having to lump all federal spending together 
in one major bill called the continuing resolution we are well on 
our way toward completing action on these bills and sending them to 
the president for signature 
the spending cuts contained in these bills will enable congress 
to meet the goals of last years budget summit they also enable 
the 100th congress to cut the budget deficit by some 70 billion 
over the last two years the deficit for fiscal year 1989 will be 
about 20 percent less than it would have been without the 
congressional budget actions and this early legislative action on 
the budget has established a discipline that we havent seen in 
perhaps 40 years 
at the beginning of the 100th congress speaker jim wright 
announced an ambitious legislative agenda to deal affirmatively and 
constructively with problems the public identified as being the 
most serious in terms of passing important new legislation this 
has been the most productive congress in decades 
here are just a few of the landmark bills we passed a clean 
water bill to combat the pollution that has endangered our water 
supply a highway bill to mprove safety and mobility for the 
traveling public a trade bill to help reverse the crippling trade 
deficit that has robbed our nation of so many good jobs a 
plantclosing bill to give american workers the same right to 
notice before a layoff that workers in most other industrial 
countries enjoy an education bill to increase the governments 
commitment to quality schools a housing bill to ease the 
difficulties that young people face in purchasing their first home 
a medicare improvement bill to protect beneficiaries from the 
impact of financially catastrophic hospital and physician expenses 
a homeless aid bill to provide help to the most unfortunate 
citizens among us and a drought relief bill to help the thousands 
of family farmers hurt by the crippling effects of drought 
and before we adjourn we hope to complete action on two other 
major american priorities antidrug legislation to give the 
government new tools to carry out the war against drug abuse and a 
welfare reform bill to give welfare recipients the training and 
supportive assistance they need to obtain and keep a job 
as holders of the public trust i think most of us in congress 
feel that these last two years have set a record the 100th congress 
can be proud of but lets be fair congress probably shouldnt 
write its own report card im confident however that in the 
months ahead the american public will look at the record and 
conclude that these last two years have been a story of promises 
made and promises kept that our major legislative goals have been 
achieved and that we have built a firmer foundation for americas 
future

feel that these last two years have set a record the 100th congress 
can be proud of but lets be fair congress probably shouldnt 
write its own report card im confident however that in the 
months ahead the american public will look at the record and 
conclude that these last two years have been a story of promises 
made and promises kept that our major legislative goals have been 
achieved and that we have built a firmer foundation for americas 
future

two experiments performed saturday 
aboard discovery ended a long wait for a couple of students whose 
projects originally were destroyed in the challenger explosion more 
than 2 years ago 
for lloyd c bruce who watched while his metalmelting 
experiment finally was performed in zero gravity the wait was well 
worth it 
it was great i had a lot of fun ive been working quite a 
while on it but im patient he said 
bruce a senior at the university of missouricolumbia was at 
the johnson space center on saturday and conducted his experiment 
along with discovery astronaut john m lounge 
richard s cavoils experiment was performed later by astronaut 
george d pinky nelson cavoli was not at jsc because he 
couldnt take time out from his medical school studies at the state 
university of new york at buffalo 
both 24yearolds were high school students bruce at sumner 
high school in st louis and cavoli at central high school in 
marlboro ny when their experiments were among those chosen as 
possible student projects for future shuttle missions both 
projects were assigned to the challenger mission which exploded 
jan 28 1986 
after the tragedy president reagan promised cavoli during his 
1986 state of the union address that his experiment would fly on a 
later shuttle mission 
cavolis experiment involved growing lead iodide crytals the 
experiment consisted of clear tubes that contained two chambers 
separated by a membrane 
lead acetate was in one end and a solution of potassium iodide 
was in the other chamber the solutions were allowed to meet at the 
membrane where they formed crystals 
bruces experiment consisted of a small furnace to test the 
effects of weightlessness on melted titanium a metal used in 
airplanes and atomic power plants he also conducted the experiment 
on earth so differences between the two can be later studied 
at the same time bruce and lounge flipped power switches that 
heated one wire at a time a closeup television view from discovery 
showed the titanium wires glowing brightly after they were heated 
after the experiments were completed bruce said the one done in 
space seemed to have performed as expected with two of the wires 
melting and then breaking 
and bruce said he hopes it isnt the end of his participation in 
the space program 
i hope to be an astronaut bruce said adding he plans to 
apply for nasas mission specialist program after he earns a 
masters degree this is one of my dreams 
yes saturday was fun but he added its not like being 
there i want to be there

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans saturday radio address given by house majority 
leader tom foley dwash 
good afternoon im tom foley the house majority leader and a 
congressman from the state of washington 
as the congress heads into its final days before adjournment in 
october it seems a good time to reflect on these last two years 
the 100th congress has been a landmark congress guided by the 
historic bipartisan budget summit of november last year congress 
moved constructively and effectively to bring about a signficant 
reduction in the national deficit that so threatens the countrys 
future and the economic security of every individual american 
the congress is determined to continue on this path of reducing 
the federal deficit and moving further toward a balanced budget 
this year we fully complied with the requirements of the 
grammrudmanhollings deficit reduction act but american society 
like the individual american is compassionate and congress as 
the representatives of a compassionate people moved to address a 
series of longstanding needs that our nation could be better poised 
to meet the challenges it faces 
the congressional leadership set a goal last january to pass all 
13 appropriation bills in time for the new fiscal year this will 
avoid the necessity of having to lump all federal spending together 
in one major bill called the continuing resolution we are well on 
our way toward completing action on these bills and sending them to 
the president for signature 
the spending cuts contained in these bills will enable congress 
to meet the goals of last years budget summit they also enable 
the 100th congress to cut the budget deficit by some 70 billion 
over the last two years the deficit for fiscal year 1989 will be 
about 20 percent less than it would have been without the 
congressional budget actions and this early legislative action on 
the budget has established a discipline that we havent seen in 
perhaps 40 years 
at the beginning of the 100th congress speaker jim wright 
announced an ambitious legislative agenda to deal affirmatively and 
constructively with problems the public identified as being the 
most serious in terms of passing important new legislation this 
has been the most productive congress in decades 
here are just a few of the landmark bills we passed a clean 
water bill to combat the pollution that has endangered our water 
supply a highway bill to mprove safety and mobility for the 
traveling public a trade bill to help reverse the crippling trade 
deficit that has robbed our nation of so many good jobs a 
plantclosing bill to give american workers the same right to 
notice before a layoff that workers in most other industrial 
countries enjoy an education bill to increase the governments 
commitment to quality schools a housing bill to ease the 
difficulties that young people face in purchasing their first home 
a medicare improvement bill to protect beneficiaries from the 
impact of financially catastrophic hospital and physician expenses 
a homeless aid bill to provide help to the most unfortunate 
citizens among us and a drought relief bill to help the thousands 
of family farmers hurt by the crippling effects of drought 
and before we adjourn we hope to complete action on two other 
major american priorities antidrug legislation to give the 
government new tools to carry out the war against drug abuse and a 
welfare reform bill to give welfare recipients the training and 
supportive assistance they need to obtain and keep a job 
as holders of the public trust i think most of us in congress 
feel that these last two years have set a record the 100th congress 
can be proud of but lets be fair congress probably shouldnt 
write its own report card im confident however that in the 
months ahead the american public will look at the record and 
conclude that these last two years have been a story of promises 
made and promises kept that our major legislative goals have been 
achieved and that we have built a firmer foundation for americas 
future

a drizzle was falling on the kremlin wreathing 
the thick red walls of the ancient fortress in mist as the last 
seconds in nearly a halfcentury of public life ticked off for 
andrei andreyevich gromyko the cold wars mr nyet 
the chimes in the spassky tower tolled noon saturday as a 
glumfaced gromyko and the 12 members of the ruling politburo filed 
into the creamcolored hall of the grand kremlin palace to open a 
special meeting of the soviet parliament 
fifteen minutes later the 79yearold gromyko retired from his 
job as president ostensibly at his own request at any rate with 
fulsome public praise from the man who succeeded him communist 
party chief mikhail s gorbachev 
gromykos exit was the end of an era in soviet political life 
one that began with wartime ussoviet collaboration and then 
turned into the superpower brinksmanship epitomized by the berlin 
wall and the cuban missile crisis 
gromyko entered his countrys diplomatic corps in 1939 and later 
served as soviet foreign minister for 28 years his pokerfaced 
countenance became a symbol of soviet intransigence worldwide and 
he was around for the eastwest honeymoons as well as the quarrels 
he served under stalin and under all of the men who succeeded 
stalin as communist party chief nikita khrushchev leonid 
brezhnev yuri andropov konstantin chernenko and gorbachev 
in his three years as a permanent representative on the un 
security council gromyko cast 26 vetoes sounding out his nyet 
no when it came his turn to vote 
but four months after taking power in march 1985 gorbachev 
replaced gromyko as foreign minister and relegated him to the 
mostly ceremonial job of president gromyko retired friday from the 
politburo 
thank you comrade deputies for the trust you have granted 
me gromyko said saturday from the supreme soviet rostrum i 
appreciated and appreciate this trust 
a loud ovation tore through the highceiling hall gorbachev 
helped gromyko back to his seat then the 1500member parliament 
voted to retire him there were no opposing votes 
gromyko sat in silence beside gorbachev at the dais facing the 
deputies as the supreme soviet members raised their right hands en 
masse to send him into retirement 
he did not take part in the vote that ended his political 
career but slouched in his greenupholstered seat wearing an 
inscrutable look 
it could have been a smile but it also could have been a 
grimace with gromyko it never was easy to tell the difference

the soviets will be able to tackle the new tasks only if they 
first and foremost restructure themselves the style and methods 
of work 
each session a meeting of the permanent commision the 
executive council and every day of deputys work is to be filled in 
with substantial work the solution of the issues put by the life 
itself should be brought under control 
a great amount of work is in store for the soviets at all 
levels which is connected with the development of our state as a 
ruleoflaw one and a qualitative leap in societys legal 
consciousness 
it is precisely this way through the extension and development 
of the role of the soviets that we will reach a rational 
separation of rights and duties among the party and soviet bodies 
economic and public organizations 
it is my conviction that under the current state of affairs 
this decision is the optimum way to promote perestroika raise the 
efficiency of the soviets and form a ruleoflaw socialist state 
basing on the unity of goals and everyones responsibility for 
ones work 
it is precisely these criteria and the progress of perestroika 
that we will apply to appraise all our future activities 
comrade deputies it is an imperative of life that the 
remaining term of the current ussr supreme soviet be used to the 
greatest advantage a new impulse is needed to improve performance 
of the supreme soviet its presidium commissions and deputies 
in accordance with the decisions of the 19th party conference 
the drafting of laws on changes and amendments to the constitution 
and on the election of peoples deputies is nearing completion the 
draft laws will soon be published for a nationwide discussion and 
in november they are to be submitted for consideration to the 
supreme soviet 
preparation for elections to the supreme body of power will 
begin after the adoption of those laws the newly elected congress 
of peoples deputies will form a new structure of central bodies of 
power with similar work to be carried out later at the republican 
and local levels 
this is a crucial task demanding thorough consideration by the 
whole of our party we will have to face many new problems and 
adopt new approaches and methods of work particularly in the light 
of the separation of duties between the party and state bodies 
the party will be most active in promoting the role of the 
soviets their selfdependence initiative and responsibility in 
attaining various economic social and cultural goals 
the soviets will take on their shoulders the major burden of 
state work and energetically execute the partys economic social 
and nationalities policies at all levels 
as we are beginning our effort to enhance the role of the 
soviets we should of course rely on the vast experience of the 
supreme soviet and all soviets nationwide 
at the same time new forms required by perestroika should be 
introduced boldly as the old arsenal will not suffice here the 
new time we are living through today the new conditions are posing 
new objectives of greater scope 
while tackling major domestic issues the supreme soviet will 
equally increase efforts in conducting the ussr foreign policy 
which has in recent years acquired a dynamic and vigorous nature 
our international course is clear it is the course of averting 
the danger of a nuclear catastrophe normalizing international 
relations establishing relations of equality and mutual benefit 
between the worlds countries and peoples broad cooperation in 
various spheres and securing every nations right to freely choose 
its destiny 
this policy is fervently approved by the soviet people 
supported by our socialist friends meets with ever growing 
understanding among large sections of the international public and 
is already bearing fruit 
we will continue to unswervingly pursue this policy 
the role of the supreme soviet its presidium and standing 
commissions and the parliamentary group is exceptionally great in 
the pursuance of soviet foreign policies 
i count on your support for my work

with a boost from kremlin chief mikhail 
s gorbachev estonians on saturday opened a congress of a popular 
movement pushing for economic cultural and political autonomy for 
their tiny republic 
gorbachev sent his endorsement to the more than 3000 delegates 
of the peoples front through his protege vajno vyalyas leader of 
estonias communist party 
the opening session in the town hall of estonias capital 
tallinn occured as gorbachev was elected president by the supreme 
soviet in moscow he replaced andrei gromyko who resigned 
vyalyas expressed gorbachevs greetings and wishes for 
success and was greeted by the delegates with applause 
the main demands of the nationalist peoples front are to make 
estonian the republics official language give it the right to 
trade with foreign countries allow the republic to conduct 
business within the soviet union independent of moscows control 
and limit migration of russians into estonia 
officials say 28 percent of the fronts members also are members 
of the communist party the front claims membership of 60000 of 
estonias 15 million people 
leaders of the peoples front formed in april said they 
recognize the primacy of the communist party in soviet society and 
do not seek to break out of the soviet union 
the peoples front is not a party it is a movement and it 
will remain a movement edgar savisaar one of the groups 
founders said in a speech saturday 
but many members say privately that their ultimate goal is full 
independence from the soviet union 
the twoday session was called to adopt a political platform and 
formally elect leaders similar groups have sprung up in the other 
two baltic republics lithuania and latvia 
the peoples front organized a demonstration by hundreds of 
people saturday night they linked arms in a human chain along the 
cobblestone streets of tallinn and chanted estonia is in our 
hands 
the chain stretched across the old town to the castlelike 
government building 
there demonstrators were asked to look toward the building in a 
symbolic gesture in support of demands that the flag of the 
formerly independent republic be flown together with the soviet 
estonian flag 
the congress got under way with the sounds of two horns played 
by an elderly man and boy wearing estonian national costumes on 
town halls huge stage 
the country and its children are waiting for action 
declared the opening speaker estonian stage actor and director 
mikk mikiver the future of estonia is in our hands 
vyalyas whose ties to gorbachev go back to the 1950s when they 
were leaders of the young communist league met with gorbachev in 
moscow on wednesday to discuss the republics reforms 
vyalyas a native estonian on june 16 replaced the unpopular 
and nonestonian party chief karl vaino he said the moscow 
leadership has firmly backed movements like the peoples front as 
long as they in turn support gorbachevs perestroika or 
restructuring program 
the baltic people the most westwardlooking of soviet 
nationalities have seized upon gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness to assert demands for preservation of their culture and 
economic independence 
estonia has surged into gorbachevs drive to revive the economy 
and to address grievances of the countrys more than 100 
nationalities 
the baltic republics were independent countries from shortly 
after the bolshevik revolution of 1917 until 1940 when they were 
absorbed into the soviet union 
under gorbachevs more tolerant policies baltic residents have 
taken to the streets to protest the secret pact between nazi 
germany and the soviet union that divided eastern europe and led to 
the soviet takeover

the government has begun seizing the 
assets of deposed president eric arturo delvalle an affluent 
businessman the judge in charge of the confiscation said saturday 
judge lorenzo parker dupuy said the treasury department issued 
the order after delvalle was formally accused of acts harmful to 
the people of panama including asking the united states to 
freeze 54 million the national bank of panama had on deposit in 
us banks 
the freeze which helped bring the panamanian economy to a near 
standstill this spring coincided with an unsuccessful opposition 
drive to force gen manuel antonio noriega the nations de facto 
ruler to resign 
parker said he began confiscating delvalles assets on thursday 
he said the government seized 18 racehorses stabled at the 
hipodromo president remon in the capital 
the judge said he did not know the value of the horses or the 
rest of delvalles assets 
the santa rosa sugar firm one of delvalles main businesses 
will be confiscated monday parker told the associated press 
parker said treasury secretary orville goodin has ordered every 
bank in panama to freeze delvalle accounts and turn over his 
records by oct 7 goodin also ordered all public registries and 
notaries to turn over any information they have on delvalles 
business interests he said 
delvalle 50 served as president from sept 27 1985 to feb 
26 1988 
noriega had the national assembly replace him in february after 
delvalle tried to remove noriega as head of the defense forces 
delvalle tried to get rid of noriega after a us grand jury 
indicted noriega on charges of drug trafficking and money 
laundering noriega has denied the charges 
the united states still recognizes delvalle who has been in 
hiding since his ouster as panamas president 
parker said the sugar firm which includes a mill in aguadulce 
110 miles from the capital will continue to operate parker said 
he will protect the interests of investors and workers 
parker said seizure orders were also issued against the assets 
of two delvalle associates juan b sosa a former ambassador to 
the united states and alberto garcia de paredes consul general in 
new york both are still recognized by the united states 
the judge said the assets of gabriel lewis galindo another 
former ambassador to the united states will also be seized

discovery commander frederick hauck 
soaked a piece of cotton in his mouth and then stored the fiber in 
a sealed vial that simple gesture may help nasa take another small 
step toward landing people on mars 
the cotton soaked with saliva which will be analyzed later on 
the ground is part of a major new nasa effort to determine how to 
keep people healthy while living in space for many months 
dr michael w bungo a researcher in space medicine said the 
medical community will have to gather a vast body of new knowledge 
before it is clear that humans will be able to sustain the stresses 
and physical changes that a twoyear voyage to mars would require 
we know the human body changes in space but we dont know if 
it could adapt to 24 months of weightlessness that would be require 
for a mars voyage he said right now we are only confident 
that people can stay in space safely for about 180 days 
a soviet cosmonaut has stayed in orbit for 326 days he said 
but nasa needs to collect similar experience 
the agency also needs to learn how to deal with medical 
emergencies in orbit 
there will be injuries and illnesses in space and we must 
learn how to deal with them said bungo there is much right 
now that we dont know 
a first step he said is to determine the type of medical 
facilities required on the space station a proposed nasa 
laboratory that will house astronaut crews for many months and to 
explore the use of pharmaceuticals 
bungo said it is known that the human body changes quickly when 
exposed to the weightlessness of space and these changes may cause 
medicines to work differently than on earth 
drugs may have to be handled differently but how said 
bungo thats one of the answers weve got to find antibiotics 
for example may be absorbed differently you really dont know how 
its going to work 
bloodflow through critical organs changes he said particularly 
to the liver and the spleen and this could affect the 
metabolization of drugs 
to explore this question the discovery crew members are acting 
as test subjects they have taken medicines which leave traces in 
the saliva by testing their saliva before during and after the 
mission doctors hope to learn about drug absorption the 
experiment will be conducted on a number of shuttle flights 
bungo said the shuttle flights also will be used to test 
surgical equipment and experimental surgery may be conducted in 
orbit on some future mission using animal subjects 
so little is known about how to perform surgery in space said 
bungo that any surgical emergency aboard the space station will 
require a quick return to earth 
there will be no major surgery in the early stages of the 
space station said bungo nothing more than suturing of minor 
lacerations is being considered 
surgery in space is a problem he said because blood tends to 
form sheets instead of flowing away from the wound and the 
surgical field is obscured microbes also tend to float in space 
making it more difficult to keep surgical wounds free of infection 
even the surgical table may be a problem said bungo until a 
way is found to keep the patient and the surgeon from floating 
around in zero gravity 
there is so much we dont know how to do bungo said

palestinians started a threeday general strike 
saturday in the occupied west bank city of hebron which army kept 
closed to outsiders after violence left two arabs dead 
soldiers shot and wounded at least 10 arabs who hurled rocks at 
israeli patrols and blocked roads with burning tires in the west 
bank towns of bethlehem and nablus and the occupied gaza strip a 
military spokeswoman said 
but a gaza reporter said six were wounded in the strip where 
the army clamped a curfew on most of rafah town to restore order 
after school boys left classes to demonstrate in the openair 
market among the wounded was a 60yearold woman shot in the 
abdomen the reporter said 
in other developments israeli radio said a reserve army captain 
would be reprimanded by his commander for tying a handcuffed arab 
protester to the bumper of a patrol car in the gaza strip the 
incident occurred days after the antiisraeli uprising erupted dec 
8 and was widely publicized 
a military police investigation into the captains behavior 
concluded the officer did not mean to humiliate the youth and only 
tied him to the jeep because there were no spare seats inside the 
car the radio said 
news reports at the time indicated the boy was being used as a 
live shield to deter others from throwing rocks 
in jerusalem a city spokeswoman said arab school children from 
grades 512 would return to classes this week 
grades 14 have already started school but the beginning of the 
academic year was delayed for the higher grades because police 
suspected activists were using classrooms as gathering points for 
violent protests 
schools and universities in the occupied west bank will remain 
closed till at least midnovember 
arabs in hebron called the strike and closed city hall to 
protest the shooting death of kayed hassan salah a shopkeeper 
killed friday when jewish settlers and soldiers chased arabs who 
stoned an israeli car it is still not clear how salah died 
a second arab 18yearold said hafez karaki died of bullet 
wounds friday when soldiers opened fire on a group of masked youths 
who threw rocks on their patrol hospital officials said 
large numbers of soldiers patrolled desolate city streets by 
foot and armored vehicle saturday to maintain a curfew that 
restricted arabs to their homes in the morning but was lifted later 
in the day the army said 
the army closed the city to reporters friday and kept it 
offlimits to outside visitors after lifting the curfew 
an arab reporter who lives in hebron said jewish settlers took 
to the streets of the old city saturday morning to sing and dance 
possibly in celebration of the weeklong feast of tabernacles the 
holiday which ends monday commemorates the biblical exodus of the 
jews from egypt 
the jewish community in hebron is home to 60 jews who live among 
70000 palestinian residents 
the nearly 10month uprising in the occupied lands has cost 280 
palestinian lives six israelis also have died in the violence 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war

a black activist who escaped 
to the us consulate after police allegedly tortured him left his 
refuge saturday to get medical treatment his lawyers said 
activist clifford ngcobo holed up in the consulate on sept 21 
after spending five months in detention without being charged he 
filed a civil court action alleging that police assaulted him and 
tortured him with electric shocks while he was in custody 
the government said ngcobo will not be redetained under 
emergency regulations but he faces possible prosecution on a 
charge of illegal weapons possession 
ngcobo had joined three prominent antiapartheid leaders who 
took refuge at the consulate after escaping on sept 13 the three 
all held without charge for more than a year say they will not 
come out until all political detainees are released 
the law firm cheadle thompson and haysom said doctors who 
examined the activist at the consulate determined that he required 
longterm therapy for anorexia and anxiety 
the law firm said the decision for ngcobo to leave the consulate 
was based partly on the law and order ministrys assertion that he 
would not be redetained 
the immediate and most pressing reason for his departure from 
the consulate however was to ensure that he received proper 
medical care and to interact with people in a normal environment to 
facilitate his recovery the lawyers statement said 
he is very fearful of redetention after his experience at the 
hands of the security police

the 3yearold embargo on trade with 
nicaragua was weakened by a judges ruling that the reagan 
administration has been improperly enforcing the law say opponents 
of us policy in central america who sued the government 
us district judge george p kazen said in a ruling released 
friday that the president has no authority to regulate or prohibit 
us citizens donations to foreign countries which the donor 
intends to be used to relieve human suffering 
the ruling limits the scope of the international emergency 
economic powers act the basis for the administrations economic 
embargo on nicaragua plaintiffs in the suit said 
i think it the ruling weakens the embargo said margaret 
ratner an attorney with the new yorkbased center for 
constitutional rights which helped file the suit in laredo on 
behalf of the veterans peace convoy inc 
the convoy group has had difficulty taking aid for nicaraguan 
civilian groups especially vehicles across the border 
theres no question it puts it the embargo on a level of 
disrepute ms ratner added here we have a federal judge 
explaining that the administration is using trade regulations in an 
illegal political manner 
justice and state department spokesmen had no immediate comment 
on the ruling because they had not seen it but justice spokesman 
brad marman said the department always abides by court rulings 
although the economic powers act containing the nicaragua trade 
control regulations contains an exemption for humanitarian aid the 
reagan administration had been interpreting it on a casebycase 
basis and refusing to allow export of certain items including cars 
and trucks the court said 
the foreign assets control office part of the treasury 
department cited the act in june and july when it stopped the 
peace convoy at the border and prevented its members from 
continuing with a donation of vehicles to nicaraguan schools 
hospitals and churches 
the judge ruled that foreign assets control which wanted convoy 
members to sign agreements that they would return the vehicles to 
the united states within 30 days may not regulate or prohibit 
directly or indirectly such donations by requiring the donor to 
seek and obtain a license prior to exportation 
convoy spokesman gerry condon also welcomed the judges ruling 
it makes arbitrary regulation of aid impossible and it does in 
a sense poke a hole in the embargo condon said ultimately we 
want to see the embargo lifted because it causes more suffering for 
the people of nicaragua than the contra war 
the us government has supported the contra rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government of nicaragua 
the veterans peace convoy collected donations in 100 cities in 
42 states last spring before converging in laredo on june 7 
after being repeatedly turned back by us customs at the mexico 
border the convoy eventually was able to quietly take 32 of the 
groups 38 vehicles across the border at laredo in july and august 
most of the vehicles now in nicaragua according to the court

soviet space officials have promised john denver 
a chance to fly in their space program in december 1989 making a 
sevenday visit to their space station mir the popular singer says 
there is still a 10 million fee standing between denver and the 
trip but that fee could be waived through the intercession of 
politically powerful friends in the soviet union denver told the 
houston chronicle in a telephone interview friday 
they told me i would have to make up my mind by november 1 
yea or nay on whether i would pay them 10 million for my training 
and housing and other needs for the trip into space denver said 
from his home in aspen colo 
denver said he wanted to conduct a television show from the mir 
that i would host and would be broadcast all over the world 
i want to talk to children all over the world denver said 
i think the next step is to have some experience of us as a 
human family and a global community and maybe my flight could be a 
sign of that kind of experience 
denver said the soviets told him he could begin training for the 
1989 mission in april or may of that year 
the singer recently took a preflight physical at johnson space 
center and had a closed meeting with astronauts to explain why he 
wants to fly in space 
im not out for publicity he said but i think i have a 
big enough voice to communicate things that should be done in 
space 
in the past he has not entirely ruled out paying the 10 
million himself if that is the only way to go into space but he 
has said it would be a major obstacle to the trip 
denver said friday that he thinks he has enough highranking 
friends in the soviet government to help him get around the 10 
million payment that glavkosmos the civilian and commercial arm of 
the soviet space program has asked him to pay 
i met soviet leader mikhail gorbachev on his visit to the 
united states denver said adding that his soviet space venture 
also had the approval of a leading soviet space planetary scientist 
who is a friend of gorbachevs 
denver said us industrialist armand hammer who has close ties 
to the soviet government also approved of his space venture

machismo and a curriculum that aims to 
harden police officers to the stresses of their jobs may have been 
behind last months outbreak of illness among recruits at an 
academy for local police forces 
sixteen recruits out of a class of 50 were hospitalized for 
exhaustion and dehydration some needed kidney dialysis and two 
remained hospitalized saturday including one who had to have a 
liver transplant and remained in a coma in critical condition 
the state attorney generals office is investigating two state 
troopers who were running physical and stress training for the 
class deny mistreating the recruits but have been temporarily 
reassigned at their own request 
we categorically deny that we did anything that was not part 
of the regular training regimen and believe that we will be 
vindicated by any objective investigation the troopers blake 
gilmore and john richardson said in a statement 
doctors said the recruits suffered kidney failure and other 
problems because of too much exercise and too little water 
one recruit who dropped out of the program said they were given 
only a small amount of water some officials theorized that 
machismo may have kept cadets from asking for more 
when you want to be a police officer youve got a lot of 
pride said pittsfield chief william m dermody i wouldnt go 
to the bubbler first either 
gary egan executive director of the group that runs the states 
police academies said last week we have no one to date who was 
denied permission to have water on request 
according to reports pieced together from recruits and police 
chiefs on the first day of class sept 19 there were two breaks 
for water in the morning at which the cadets were required to stand 
in line and fill paper cups from a fountain 
some chiefs said they spoke about the academy off the record 
saying they feared state trooper instructors would take revenge on 
their cadets there has traditionally been tension between state 
and local police in massachusetts 
its a conspiracy of silence said one of the nearly dozen 
chiefs interviewed ive got to send cadets down there and the 
troopers will get em 
we dont buy that kind of excuse egan said about chiefs who 
would talk only off the record he is executive director of the 
criminal justice training council a group of 23 law enforcement 
officials that runs the police academies 
the ailments that struck the cadets might still be secret if not 
for an anonymous caller who told the associated press on sept 22 
to check on cadets in local hospitals and then hung up 
pittsfield mayor anne wojtkowsi said she is seeking national 
attention to the case so that there is no way the state can cover 
up this thing 
the academy one of five in the state opened in 1984 to provide 
training for officers in the 74 towns and cities of western 
massachusetts 
the outbreak of illness was not the first time trouble has been 
alleged at the academy in previous years one cadet claimed he was 
hit with a club another said she was taunted while her head was 
shaved and another said he was forced to do pushups with a bucket 
on his head 
a member of the massachusetts commission against discrimination 
looked into the academy four years ago following discrimination 
claims by two minority women 
commissioner frederick hurst said the women told the truth about 
head shaving humiliation and overexertion but he denied they were 
singled out for punishment 
michael purcell dropped out of the academy and quit the 
northampton police force after watching timothy shepard collapse 
from heat stroke sept 19 
purcell claimed troopers pushed cadets to the limits of their 
endurance with pushups and laps and allowed them only a few small 
cups of water until shepard collapsed 
shepard 25 of pittsfield underwent a liver transplant tuesday 
at a pittsburgh hospital and remained in a coma saturday 
according to the chiefs and recruits the cadets got an extended 
water break after shepard collapsed and was taken to a hospital 
but others who faltered were required to do more exercises they 
said 
the criminal justice councils manual on stress training 
recommends that troopers verbally abuse cadets for performance 
failures and shout confusing orders 
the cadets have to learn to control themselves and their 
emotions so they can handle the street said judy crossen 
director of training for the states five regional police academies 
barbara kopans assistant secretary of public safety said the 
aim of the program was to condition recruits against overreacting 
if they are eventually assigned to a riot situation we dont 
want them to overreact if someone is throwing rocks at them she 
said we want them to learn not to let their anger carry them 
away 
we are not doing it just to be mean there is a reason for 
it she said 
she said the physical training of the agawam class has been put 
on hold during the investigation but the recruits are still 
subject to verbal punishment and induced stress 
some military trainers say abuse is counterproductive there 
was a time when army training was abusive said lt col gregory 
rixon a pentagon spokesman thats gone by the wayside theres 
no use in calling somebody maggot or meathead 
some of the western massachusetts police chiefs who voted 
unanimously in 1984 to support the academys tough training say 
they now wonder about the wisdom of the program 
we dont need marine corps recruits said one chief we 
need compassionate human beings trained to handle situations and 
you dont get that with a lot of gestapo storm troopers humiliating 
people

democrat michael dukakis kept up his attack against george bush 
on the evironment saturday saying the democrats would win the 
white house and put an end to years of desecrating our heritage 
republican bush was taking the weekend off from campaigning 
before flying to california on monday to welcome back the space 
shuttle and its astronauts 
the vice presidential candidates sens lloyd bentsen and dan 
quayle spent much of saturday preparing for their only 
facetoface debate of the campaign wednesday nights nationally 
televised confrontation in omaha neb 
a quayle spokesman said the indiana senator met with president 
reagan at the white house and later had a mock debate with sen bob 
packwood rore standing in for bentsen spokesman david prosperi 
said of the meeting with reagan the senator was looking for 
advice and counsel from the president who has participated in quite 
a few presidential debates in his lifetime 
bentsen spoke briefly to reporters in washington after a 
strategy session with four fellow democrats in congress he said 
simply their advice is to be myself in the debate 
former democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson urged a 
crowd at a voterregistration rally in chicago to support dukakis 
over bush whom he called meanspirited 
jackson said bushs attacks on dukakis for being a member of the 
american civil liberties union amounted to a backhanded swipe at 
the entire civil rights community not just the aclu 
you see mr bush you call people who fight for liberty 
subversive jackson said accusing bush of being on an ugly and 
mean side of history 
dukakis was the only candidate on the campaign trail saturday 
pledging at a rally near the golden gate bridge to declare more 
than half californias coastline marine sanctuaries to protect 
it from offshore oil drilling 
our environment cant take four more years of damage and 
neglect dukakis said starting on jan 20 1989 were going 
to stop desecrating our heritage and start preserving and 
protecting our environment once again 
dukakis spoke while standing before fogshrouded san francisco 
bay and golden gate bridge addressing a crowd of 2000 people or 
more at a sandy stretch of us park serviceprotected land 
he has previously opposed offshore oil drilling in areas along 
californias coast and in the spring bush changed his position to 
back a temporary halt in the sale of drilling leases in sections of 
the state aides said dukakis does not oppose drilling in all areas 
but in those deemed environmentally sensitive 
dukakis renewed his blasts at bushs environmental record 
saying the vice president had supported controversial interior 
secretary james watt had supported vetoes of the clean water act 
had fought to keep harmful lead in gasoline and still supports 
drilling for offshore oil in the most environmentally sensitive 
areas 
george bush is trying to throw his environmental record 
overboard in this campaign dukakis said thats a case of 
ocean dumping were going to stop right now 
dukakis said he would designate sanctuary along the coast from 
big sur south of monterey north to the oregon border an area 
covering more than half the 1200mile shoreline that california 
environmentalists have sought to have protected from drilling he 
also promised to consider portions of other coastal states 
he has been focusing on the environment in his bid to become the 
first democrat since 1964 to carry california on his last trip to 
the state dukakis pledged to make the environmental protection 
agency a cabinet department 
the massachusetts governor also has been critiized by bush on 
the environmental issue in television ads blaming dukakis for 
pollution in boston harbor 
dukakis answered back in his speech ill tell you one kind of 
garbage the people of boston wont harbor and thats george 
bushs claim to be an environmentalist 
earlier dukakis stopped at a childrens soccer field in 
sacramento where he talked with the kids and kicked a soccer ball 
kicking two balls into the goal and sailing one over it 
elsewhere in california at edwards air force base a bush 
campaign spokesman said the vice president wanted to be the first 
person to greet the returning astronauts when they get out of the 
space shuttle discovery after landing there monday 
bush figures to gain favorable publicity by his appearance at 
the end of a space mission widely hailed by americans however his 
spokesman said bush would be there by virtue of his office not as 
a candidate for the presidency 
bush himself said last week that inviting dukakis to the event 
would turn it into a political event 
dukakis declined to comment directly when asked about former cia 
director stansfield turners contention that turner took panamanian 
gen manuel noriega off the agencys payroll when he took over from 
bush but that bush reinstated noriega after becoming vice president 
in 1981 
the democrat did say maybe at the next debate well get a few 
straight answers out of mr bush about his relationship with 
noriega 
bush spokesman steve hart said friday that turners allegation 
that bush had reinstated noriega was absolutely untrue

the information section in a new yellow 
pages directory mislabels a couple of interstates describes a 
thousandfoot tower visible from miles away that in fact was 
never built and in general contains so many goofs that the 
redfaced publishers are just going to start all over 
were not sure just what form it will take but we will 
reprint it in some way shape or form said charles o yokum a 
spokesman for the ameritech publishing co 
were in the community to stay so we have to make it right 
and fix it so these kinds of errors dont happen again yokum 
said 
the 56page infopages section is in the front of the 900000 
newly printed indianapolis yellow pages directories yokum figures 
the cost of reprinting the section will be at least 100000 
the things to see and do section of the infopages 
contains the biggest error or at least the tallest it directs 
visitors to indiana tower and describes it in great detail 
rising to a height of 1000 feet it is the centerpiece of 
white river state park a landmark attraction the description 
reads the only problem is the tower was deleted from the original 
plans for the park 
the section also has mislabeled interstate highways and an 
alphabetized directory of city and county streets with 
corresponding maps that dont have grid letters and numbers 
it defines the indiana university natatorium the indoor 
swimming and diving complex as a track and field stadium with 
numerous tennis courts and a bicycle racing track 
there are too many mistakes for us to live with yokum said 
so we will do it no matter how much it costs

jesse jackson urged his supporters to vote for 
fellow democrat michael dukakis on saturday calling republican 
george bush dangerous and meanspirited and condemning bushs 
remarks about the american civil liberties union 
you see mr bush you call people who fight for liberty 
subversive jackson said in remarks to about 1000 people at a 
voter registration rally at operation push headquarters he said 
the republican presidential nominee was on an ugly and mean side 
of history 
he said bushs attacks on the organization are a backhanded 
swipe at the entire civil rights community not just the aclu 
he was taking a backhanded swipe at the entire civil liberties 
community 
there is something dangerous and meanspirited about bush 
jackson said 
he also took bush to task for the vice presidents comments 
during last sundays debate that many of the nations homeless 
people are mentally sick 
bush assumes the homeless are homeless because something is 
wrong with them emotionally jackson said calling that a 
contemptuous way the rich look down at the poor 
i would remind mr bush that christmas which we celebrate not 
far from now is not about big gifts for rich friends it is not 
about santa claus and reindeer christmas mr bush is about a 
homeless couple jackson said 
homeless people are simply poor and unemployed and need help 
the former democratic candidate said 
mr bush turns his back on the homeless following a tradition 
of abandoning the homeless jackson said the homeless are not 
helpless and they must not be hopeless because they can hope hope 
is on the way 
he said he supports dukakis because there is a need to choose 
a new direction in next months presidential election 
jackson praised dukakis call for a national health insurance 
program and criticized bush for opposing it 
when the president or vice president or the supreme court 
justices or members of congress get sick the government takes them 
to walter reed army hospital and takes care of their medical 
bills he said 
if its good enough for the president its good enough for

portauprince haiti ap haitians and western diplomats 
saturday praised the military governments unexpected ouster of a 
powerful colonel who faces drug charges in the united states 
the removal of col jeanclaude paul as commander of the feared 
dessalines barracks could prompt washington to resume 60 million 
in annual aid the funds were cut off after last years 
electionday massacre in which thugs believed to be supported by 
pauls soldiers killed 34 people at the polls 
us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde said she was told paul was 
replaced by his secondincommand lt col guy francois 
in washington state department spokeswoman sondra mccarty said 
recent developments including the retirement of col paul are 
steps in the right direction the departure of col paul in 
particular will improve prospects for cooperation in antinarcotics 
efforts 
our objectives in haiti remain the same transition to a 
freely elected government respect for human rights economic 
justice and cooperation in antinarcotics activities reinstatement 
of aid continues to depend on concrete progress in all of these 
areas she said 
paul has been linked to the tonton macoutes the hated personal 
forces of the duvalier dictatorship 
in march he was indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on 
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the united states 
bursts of gunfire were heard late friday night when the 
government television announced pauls forced retirement but 
portauprince was calm saturday and it was quiet at the 700man 
dessalines barracks 
a fine maneuver a masterstroke a western diplomat said of 
pauls ouster the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
said he was told paul was no longer in the barracks but his 
whereabouts were not known 
also saturday members of the presidential guard appeared on 
state television with four handcuffed men accused by the soldiers 
of being tonton macoutes 
the soldiers said the men participated in the nov 29 election 
massacre with weapons personally supplied by paul all denied 
participation in the massacre 
paul very popular among his troops was the only major unit 
commander to remain in power following the sept 17 enlisted mens 
coup that overthrew haitian ruler lt gen henri namphy and placed 
lt gen prosper avril in power 
last week the rankandfile soldiers removed nearly 60 
unpopular officers with ties to the duvalier family regime 
the television announcement said pauls dismissal was signed by 
avril and col carl dorsainvil minister of defense and interior 
perhaps his retirement is in response to the demands of the 
americans but at the same time there is a general cleanup in the 
army communist party leader rene theodore said saturday 
as head of the most brutal unit in haitis 7000member army 
paul had been considered one of the most powerful figures in the 
military soldiers who staged the coup against namphy said they 
wanted to name paul armed forces chief but decided not to because 
of the drug charges 
haitian and diplomatic sources said pauls ouster would likely 
lead to renewed us aid to haiti but the state department has 
conditioned a resumption of aid on democratic reforms and has said 
paul should answer the drug charges in court 
namphy reassigned paul to an administrative position in june 
but paul refused and was backed by president leslie manigat namphy 
ousted manigat accusing him of meddling in army affairs and paul 
remained head of his battalion paul did not intervene when 
soldiers ousted namphy on sept 17 
haitian politicians hailed the forced retirement after it was 
announced friday they said it showed the 2weekold government was 
moving in the right direction 
francois papa doc duvalier ruled from 1957 until his death 
in 1971 when his son jeanclaude baby doc duvalier assumed 
the presidency on feb 7 1986 after months of civil disorder 
jeanclaude fled to exile in france

volume was published by church founder joseph smith in 1830 smith 
said he translated the work from gold plates given him by an angel 
named moroni 
the churchs 65 million members believe the book is a history 
of ancient peoples who came to the americas from the middle east 
and were visited by a resurrected jesus christ shortly after his 
crucifixion 
i do not know fully why god has preserved my life to this age 
but i do know this that for the present hour he has revealed to me 
the absolute need for us to move the book of mormon forward now in 
a marvelous manner said benson who was us secretary of 
agriculture in the cabinet of president dwight d eisenhower 
we have the book of mormon we have the members we have the 
missionaries we have the resources and the world has the need

fledgling tropical storm isaac lost its punch 
saturday and was downgraded to a depression then a tropical wave 
prompting cancellations of storm warnings for six caribbean islands 
isaac which formed friday in the tropical atlantic just as 
hurricane helene was reclassified as a bad storm in the far north 
atlantic was clipped by strong winds in the upper atmosphere 
those winds scattered isaacs strength 
at 6 pm edt isaac was classified a tropical wave after losing 
its surface circulation at noon it was located about 770 miles 
southeast of portauprince haiti the wave was moving toward the 
west away from the windward islands said forecasters at the 
national hurricane center 
but forecaster bob case said showers and thunderstorms could 
dump heavy rains on parts of the windward islands through saturday 
night he advised small craft in the lesser antilles to remain in 
port until winds and seas subside 
when isaac weakened tropical storm warnings were canceled for 
the islands of barbados the grenadines st vincent st lucia 
dominica and martinique trinidad and tobago discontinued tropical 
storm watches earlier saturday 
also saturday forecasters were watching a westwardmoving 
tropical wave in the atlantic midway between northwestern africa 
and the lesser antilles 
tropical waves become depressions if winds start moving in a 
circular pattern around cores of low pressure they become named 
storms if winds hit 39 mph and hurricanes if winds reach 74 mph

an 18yearold student pilot took a small 
airplane from an airport landed it on a turnpike then stole a car 
in his attempts to flee police early saturday morning authorities 
said 
he didnt even solo yet said scott buchanan of the novice 
who took the twoseat cessna from the flight school where buchanan

after hours he said 
morgan said he spotted the plane flying erratically during a 
nighttime check at skyhaven airport in southeastern new hampshire 
he said ellison landed at the airport but apparently noticed 
the police cruiser and started to take off again 
morgan said he chased the plane down the runway driving 
parallel to the plane and flashing his blue lights but didnt 
manage to prevent the escape

discoverys astronauts rehearsed a 
new emergency escape system saturday after helping president reagan 
keep a promise and reassuring a worried 14yearold that 
americas space program is back on track 
the crew of the first shuttle flight in 32 months also tested an 
infrared communications system designed to keep space snoops from 
eavesdropping mission specialist george pinky nelson conducted 
radio checks with the device throughout one orbit and his voice was 
clearly heard in mission control 
earlier nelson and commander frederick h hauck wormed their 
way into bulky orange pressure suits designed to protect shuttle 
astronauts who are forced to bail out of a disabled spacecraft 
its a struggle to get into these things said nelson after 
he had donned his suit it doesnt take very long and they are 
warm no doubt about that 
on a televised view of the rehearsal nelsons face was streaked 
with perspiration 
nelson also helped hauck into his suit while their crewmates 
pilot richard covey and mission specialists david hilmers and john 
m lounge watched and timed their progress 
in the television view hauck was seen to put on the bottom of 
the suit both legs at a time causing covey to note oh the 
wonders of zero g gravity 
although the astronauts spent hours on earth practicing with the 
equipment the suits had never been donned in the weightlessness of 
space 
nelson also practiced installing a long bulky pole that would 
be used as a kind of firemans slide to speed the crews exit from 
a disabled shuttle 
the equipment was designed in the aftermath of the challenger 
explosion although it would not have helped the seven crew members 
who died when that shuttle blew up on jan 28 1986 the system 
which includes explosives to blow open a hatch gives astronauts an 
escape if the craft is in stable gliding flight but unable to make 
a runway landing 
mission control reported that discovery continued to function 
smoothly as it flashed past the halfway mark of a fourday flight 
the first shuttle mission since challenger is to end on monday at 
1233 pm edt when discovery touches down at edwards air force 
base calif 
flight controller milton heflin said experts were studying a 
balky cabin cooling system that iced up shortly after launch 
mission control turned on heaters to thaw the ice away but heflin 
said even if the problem persisted there was another system that 
could keep the cabin cool during its return to earth 
cabin temperatures have hovered in the 80s while the ice has 
been thawing but heflin said the crew appeared to be comfortable 
earlier hauck took television time to read what he called a 
particularly meaningful letter from phillip j pj morgan 
a brooklyn ny high school student 
in the letter the student described himself as a worried 
14yearold that is worried about the future 
i feel some of americas future is riding on you and your 
crews shoulders the letter said 
hauck said he called morgan before discoverys launch on 
thursday and said the youth was concerned whether we were still 
capable of doing the things that make us a great country 
the astronaut said he hopes youngsters everywhere can see we 
are back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that 
will come in the future 
discoverys astronauts were awakened at 437 am edt when 
mission control radioed a beach boys tune that included lyrics 
adapted for the space travelers 
round round we orbit round and were going to town 
well were racking up the miles with a whole lot of power 
were going seventeen thousand five hundred an hour 
the wireless intercom system that nelson tested operates through 
the use of invisible infrared lights that are pulsed by the spoken 
voice receivers detect the light pulses and convert them back to 
sound providing wireless invisible communications 
engineers developed the system to avoid the possibility that 
radio intercom talk inside the shuttle could escape to space and be 
picked up by spy satellites secure communications are a concern of 
the department of defense since the shuttle is increasingly to be 
used for secret air force missions 
the astronauts also helped reagan keep a promise by operating 
new versions of two student experiments that were destroyed on 
challenger 
one was designed by richard s cavoli a student mentioned by 
reagan during his 1986 state of the union address in the speech 
reagan promised cavoli that the experiment destroyed on challenger 
would fly on a later shuttle mission 
cavolis experiment consisted of tubes that contained two 
chambers separated by a membrane in one end of the tubes was lead 
acetate and in the other a solution of potassium iodide when the 
fluids were allowed to meet at the membrane they were expected to 
form crystals of lead iodide 
nelson operated the experiment and after just five minutes 
reported the crystals are going at a good rate 
a closeup television view showed a grouping of yellow crystals 
clustered on the membrane 
cavoli created the experiment while a student at central high 
school in marlboro ny he now is a medical student at the state 
university of new york in buffalo 
lounge operated an experiment that had been devised for 
challenger by lloyd c bruce a st louis student 
bruce designed a small furnace to test the effects of 
weightlessness on melted titanium a metal used in airplanes and 
atomic power plants 
a close television view beamed from discovery showed wires of 
titanium glowing brightly one by one as lounge turned on the 
power as planned two of the wires melted then broke 
bruce now a senior at the university of missouri watched the 
performance of the experiment from mission control and said it went 
as planned bruce devised the experiment while a student at sumner 
high school in st louis 
engineers and scientists are interested in the effects of 
weightlessness on melted metals because of the theory that the 
absence of gravity may cause the molten metal to cool with larger 
crystals this would give more strength to the material

prime minister brian mulroney on saturday 
dissolved parliament and announced elections nov 21 in a bid to 
keep alive his freetrade agreement with the united states 
mulroney is gambling that his majority progressive conservative 
government will be the first to return with a majority since the 
liberals did it in 1953 
i invite canadians to judge our record he said outside 
government house after consulting with governor general jeanne 
sauve 
flanked by three maple leaf flags he promised the progressive 
conservatives will offer an agenda of confidence for canada 
with the freetrade pact very much a centerpiece of the 
campaign 
the main opposition liberals and the socialist new democratic 
party oppose the trade agreement and say it would destroy canadas 
sovereignty 
liberal leader john turner welcomed mulroneys announcement he 
accused mulroney of trying to make canada a colony of the united 
states with the plan 
were going to be saying to canadians this is more than an 
election this is your future turner said 
turners liberals control the unelected senate and have been 
blocking the freetrade deal there the agreement has been passed 
by the house of commons but must get senate approval before taking 
effect 
turner has promised the senate blockade will be lifted if 
mulroney wins a majority in the election for the 295 seats in the 
commons 
mulroney had been waiting for an encouraging sign before calling 
the election the sign came thursday with the release of a poll 
indicating the conservatives with 40 percent support compared with 
31 percent for the democrats and 26 percent for the liberals 
mulroney began his fourth year in office on sept 17 and under 
the constitution could have served five yearshe became leader of 
his party in 1983 and scored a landslide victory in 1984 
in the last election the conservatives won 204 seats in the 
commons the liberals had 38 the democrats 32 independents 3 
independent liberals 1 and four seats were vacant because of 
redistribution 13 seats will be added for the november election 
if mulroney wins in november the worlds two largest trading 
partners will proceed with plans to create a north american free 
trade zone on jan 1 the pact will eliminate tariffs and a number 
of other trade curbs over 10 years 
if mulroney loses the liberals and the democrats led by ed 
broadbent say they will tear up the deal 
the trade agreement was approved by the us senate on sept 19 
and signed by president reagan but remains frozen until canadas 
senate also passes it 
mulroney said the agreement would create more jobs in canada 
during his speech saturday he also called for an agreement with 
the united states to cut emissions that cause acid rain and he 
urged a nationwide effort to curb pollution in canada 
in addition to he freetrade deal other issues expected to 
dominate the election include integrity in government mulroney 
faced a number of scandals involving cabinet ministers and party 
members 
jobs will likely be a major issue since mulroney came to power 
the conservatives say 13 million jobs have been created the 
opposition says the figures were doctored to make it look as if job 
creation worked 
all candidates are likely to be hounded by the issue of 
abortion made legal in january when the nations supreme court 
struck down the existing law restricting access to abortion as 
unconstitutional 
neither mulroney nor turner has a clearcut position on the 
matter broadbent believes abortion is a womans right 
senate members are appointed by the governor general who by 
constitutional convention acts on the advice of the prime 
minister senate seats are apportioned on a regional basis

hundreds of thousands of people jammed a 
broad avenue saturday to call for the rejection of president 
augusto pinochet in a nationwide referendum this week 
organizers said 12 million people packed a working class 
neighborhood about five miles south of the center of santiago for 
the demonstration marking the official close of the oppositions 
campaign 
after the rally ended small groups marched downtown and clashed 
with police who dispersed them with water cannons police said 
more than 20 people were arrested 
police did not give an estimate of the size of the crowd at the 
rally but reporters on the scene said it was in excess of 350000 
chileans are to vote wednesday to approve or reject pinochet 
the 72yearold president and army commander who seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup elected president salvador allende a marxist 
was ousted and died in the coup 
pro and antigovernment forces have been waging ardent but

the government sunday denied a 
report that president pw botha had promised the unconditional 
release of jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
roland darroll a spokesman for the foreign affairs department 
disputed a french news report that quoted president mobutu sese 
seko of zaire as saying botha made the promise during the two 
leaders summit meeting saturday in northern zaire 
darroll said mobutu if quoted properly was overstating the 
gist of the summit discussion and may not have appreciated the 
qualifications set out by botha regarding mandela 
botha has frequently said he would release mandela in exchange 
for a renunciation of violence mandela currently in a clinic in 
cape town recuperating from tuberculosis has refused to repudiate 
the violent tactics of the outlawed antiapartheid movement he led 
before his imprisonment in 1962 
darroll speaking by telephone from pretoria noted that mobutu 
and botha has issued a joint communique which said that mobutu 
was encouraged by the flexible approach taken by president 
botha regarding mandelas release 
mandela 70 is widely considered the most popular leader among 
south africas disenfranchised black majority 
since his hospitalization for tuberculosis in august there has 
been speculation that the government might free him even without an 
explicit renunciation of violence 
the joint communique issued by botha and mobutu also touched on 
another major political controversy in south africa the fate of a 
group of black prisoners on death row known as the sharpeville six 
according to the communique botha reiterated that would 
consider granting clemency to the six but only after completion on 
an ongoing appeal process 
the six five men and a woman were sentenced to hang for 
complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black township official 
the case has stirred controversy because a key state witness now 
claims he was coerced by police into giving false testimony and 
because there was no evidence the six contributed physically to the 
death they were convicted under the doctrine of common 
purpose which held them responsible because they allegedly were 
active participants in the mob 
botha on his return flight from zaire told reporters he 
planned more diplomatic initiatives in africa this year but 
declined to give specifics 
africa is talking to south africa he said

successful morning 
on his return flight to south africa botha told reporters he 
planned more diplomatic initiatives in africa this year 
africa is talking to south africa said botha 
a joint statement released after the meeting said the two also 
discussed jailed black south african activist nelson mandela and 
the fate of six black south africans facing the death penalty in 
the 1984 mob killing of a black township official 
roland darroll a south african foreign affairs department 
spokesman denied a report that mandela was about to be released 
the report from the french news agency agence francepresse 
quoted mobutu saturday as saying he had obtained mandelas 
liberation soon and without conditions 
mandela 70 leader of the antiapartheid african national 
congress was sentenced to life in prison in june 1964 botha has 
said he would release mandela if he renounces violence and mandela 
has refused 
the statement also said botha reiterated to mobutu that he would 
consider granting clemency to the six jailed south africans who 
critics say have been wrongly implicated in the slaying but only 
after the appeals process is completed 
the south african broadcasting corp meanwhile reported mobutu 
and the leaders of gabon congo angola and zambia planned to meet 
in the zambian capital of lusaka on thursday apparently to discuss 
developments in the angolan war 
in kinshasa the zairean capital700 miles to the southwest 
where bothas plane stopped to refuel troops opened fire on about 
200 students demonstrating at the university of kinshasa against 
his visit 
witnesses said at least two students were injured one struck in 
the neck by a bullet and another hit in the leg both were taken to 
the university clinic for treatment but their conditions were not 
known 
the meeting was bothas first with mobutu and his third summit 
in black africa during his 10 years in power all of them the past 
three weeks 
on sept 13 botha met with president joaquim chissano of 
mozambique a longtime adversary of south africa the next day he 
visited president kamuzu banda of malawi the only african country 
to maintain full diplomatic relations with pretoria 
one of bothas foreign policy goals has been to broaden ties 
with black africa without having to make substantive political 
concessions to the disenfranchised black majority in his own 
country 
botha told reporters he and mobutu spoke about the latest round 
of usmediated talks in the congolese capital of brazzaville 
aimed at a peace agreement between south africa and angola 
we discussed peace in africa and in southern africa 
especially we discussed the angolan question which is of vital 
importance to all of us and we discussed the southwest africa 
namibia problem which is being dealt with in the near future 
botha said 
despite the lack of formal relations zaire and many other 
african countries trade with south africa and rely on its ports and 
railroad lines for handling imports and exports 
south african products are sold in zaire and more than a third 
of zaires main export copper is routed through south africa 
the brazzaville talks between south africa and an angolancuban 
delegation adjourned thursday without agreement on a timetable for 
withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban troops in angola 
supporting the government 
south africa has offered to begin implementation on nov 1 of a 
united nations plan for independence for southwest africa or 
namibia if a cuban withdrawal from angola can be negotiated

kidnappers holding three american 
educators and an indian instructor said saturday they will release 
one hostage to increase us support for palestinians in the 
israeliocupied territories 
the announcement came in a handwritten statement in arabic from 
a group calling itself islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
the statement did not identify the hostage to be freed nor set a 
specific deadline for his release 
we shall free one of the hostages its a difficult decision 
for us but we shall ascertain our good intentions and our 
seriousness in this matter the statement said 
this should be a clear signal for washington to carry out what 
it should do in the area to support the 10month palestinian 
uprising against the israeli military occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip the statement added 
it said the groups decision to free one hostage was designed to 
win more public sympathy for the uprising of our people to wrest 
their rights 
the four hostages being held by the group are alann steen 49 a 
journalism teacher jesse turner 41 a professor of mathematics 
and computer science robert polhill 55 a lecturer in accounting 
and indian mithileshwar singh 60 a professor of finance and a 
legal resident alien of the united states 
they were kidnapped jan 24 1987 from the campus of the 
usaffiliated beirut university college by gunmen posing as 
police 
the 22line statement from islamic jihad was accompanied by a 
photograph showing steen and turner with their arms around each 
other and holding cigarettes 
it was the fourth statement on the four hostages since sept 15 
from the group which is believed made up of shiite moslem zealots 
loyal to iran and sympathetic to yasser arafats palestine 
liberation organization 
the first statement said the kidnappers were willing to free the 
four if the united states undertook an initiative in support of the 
palestinian uprising 
the following two expressed dismay at the us failure to 
declare outright support for the palestinian right to 
selfdetermination 
there are 17 foreigners believed held in lebanon including nine 
americans longest held is american terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
the statement on saturday also said the american 
administation is still denying the simplest human values toward our 
people we have repeatedly stated our demand in this regard and we 
want public opinion and the international community to record this 
american precedent 
but in spite of everything we are determined and shall go 
ahead with our initiative and plan to resolve this problem 
however the continuation of progress is linked to the emergence of 
new and positive elements in the middle east 
finally we call on the families of the hostages to come to 
lebanon to participate in the festivity of the release of the 
hostage 
three of the hostages wives currently are living at the beirut 
university college and mrs steen now in the united states said 
she was planning to leave wednesday for beirut to return to her 
teaching job there 
steens wife called the report the most wonderful thing in the 
world 
im sitting on pins and needles right now mrs steen 32 
said in a telephone interview with the associated press in new york 
from her hometown of clark lake mich 
turners lebanese wife badr said we hope all of them are 
going to be released i hope theyre going to be released soon

over the republics two autonomous provinces vojvodina and kosovo 
krunic 59 was known to have opposed milosevics centralist 
plans

support of milosevics drive more rallies were reported saturday

emperor hirohito received a blood transfusion after 
suffering more internal bleeding sunday but doctors said the 
87yearold monarchs condition was stable 
the tranfusion was the second since hirohitos condition 
suddenly deteriorated saturday when worsening internal bleeding 
caused his blood pressure to plummet 
relatives rushed to his bedside but his condition stabilized 
after a transfusion on saturday doctors said 
the imperial household agency said that the emperor was given 
another 04pint transfusion sunday after discharging a small 
amount of blood through his bowels 
the palace reported that as of 900 am 8 pm edt the 
worlds oldest monarch was resting and in stable condition with 
his temperature only slightly above normal 
the setback on saturday came hours after doctors fed hirohito 
some porridge his first food in nearly two weeks court officials 
said then his condition was moving in a very good direction 
 
but hirohito suddenly discharged a large volume of blood from 
his bowels and his blood pressure dropped dangerously for about 30 
minutes imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda said 
officials said the discharge was not related to the food 
crown prince akihito crown princess michiko and other court 
officials were summoned to the imperial palace in a sudden flurry 
of activity seen by reporters stationed there since sept 19 when 
hirohito vomited blood from an intestinal hemorrhage 
prince aya akihitos second son arrived in tokyo after being 
called back from his studies at oxford university in england and 
immediately visited his grandfather 
hirohitos blood pressure and pulse returned to previous levels 
after doctors gave him an emergency blood transfusion of 13 pints 
followed by another transfusion of 04 pints maeda said 
something that we hoped wouldnt occur did occur chief 
imperial physician akira takagi said but the emperors body 
responded quickly to the emergency blood transfusion as chief 
physician i can relax a bit now since his condition has 
stabilized 
saturdays transfusions brought the total amount of blood 
hirohito has received since sept 19 to 98 pints more than his 
bodys normal total news reports said 
doctors are worried that the volume of transfusions needed to 
compensate for hirohitos internal bleeding may have side effects 
they say is losing strength because intraveneous feeding alone 
cannot supply enough nutrients 
other than five or six spoonfuls of porridge saturday morning 
and two small ice cubes more than a week ago the emperor has been 
unable to eat or drink since the crisis began 
newspapers reported saturday that palace doctors also were 
worried about hirohitos worsening jaundice and said his hands and 
feet were swollen because of a malfunctioning kidney 
the yomiuri shimbun japans largest newspaper said doctors 
feared his internal bleeding spread from the intestine to other 
organs 
several news reports have said hirohito has cancer of the upper 
intestine palace officials have refused to comment and urged the 
media to refrain from speculation 
maeda said hirohitos temperature saturday evening was 995 
compared with his normal reading of about 959 his pulse was 84 
and his blood pressure 142 over 72 he said both levels were 
similar to those before saturdays bleeding 
under the constitution the emperor is a symbol of the state 
with little real power his duties include receiving foreign 
dignitaries and placing official seals on government documents

iran and iraq resumed peace talks 
saturday and secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar offered new 
proposals to break a stalemate over navigation rights a senior 
european diplomat said 
the talks lasted about four hours and concluded at about 10 pm 
diplomats said the sides remained deadlocked over the crucial 
shattalarab waterway and irans policy of searching ships for 
iraqbound war cargo 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati said the sides would 
meet again on monday he said negotiators were discussing the 
provision in a us ceasefire accord that calls for iran and iraq 
to withdraw all forces to the internationally recognized borders 
without delay 
a spokesman for the iraqi delegation said the talks were still 
on square one 
there was no tangible progress in the iranian position since 
aug 25th when the talks began in geneva he added speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
un spokeswoman nadia younes said perez de cuellar will contact 
both delegations monday about holding separate talks 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz had no comment upon his 
departure and perez de cuellar left by a separate exit avoiding 
reporters 
the iranians and iraqis were in separate rooms and perez de 
cuellar shuttled between them with proposals and counterproposals 
aziz and velyati met separately friday evening with perez de 
cuellar and his special mediator swedish un ambassador jan k 
eliasson 
the major issue separating the two sides is the shattalarab 
waterway which forms the nations southern border 
when talks broke off sept 13 in geneva iraq was insisting that 
the shattalarab be cleared of sunken ships and silt to be made 
navigable again the waterway is iraqs only outlet to the persian 
gulf 
iraq also wanted iran to cease halting neutral ships in the gulf 
to inspect them for iraqbound war cargo 
the geneva talks opened aug 25 five days after a truce in the 
8yearold iraniraq war began

stalemate said greek foreign minister karolos papoulias chairman 
of the council of foreign ministers of the 12 european community 
nations 
efforts have been undertaken on the part of the 
secretarygeneral to resolve the deadlock that has evolved in that 
area and always there is hope that the deadlock will be 
overcome papoulias said friday after meeting aziz and velayati 
after so many years of war the issues cannot be overcome from 
one day to another he said 
aziz said he was hopeful of a breakthrough but offered no 
specific reason for his optimism 
velayati told reporters we do hope that during these talks 
that are taking place in new york we could reach a tangible 
result and we hope that we could reach a concrete conclusion for 
the implementation of the other provisions of resolution 598 
resolution 598 passed last year by the un security council 
calls for a ceasefire the exchange of war prisoners and a return 
to international borders 
iraq has agreed to only one negotiating session in new york and 
wants the talks shifted back to geneva

a federal judge with a tough reputation 
has tentatively agreed to let a man who helped import 11 tons of 
marijuana to run a hospice for aids patients in lieu of a maximum 
15year prison sentence 
us district judge gene carter said he would agree to the 
alternative sentence for harvey prager pending submission of 
additional papers from attorneys he set sentencing for oct 7 
carter has a reputation for imposing severe sentences in drug 
cases and assistant us attorney joseph h groff iii said the 
judge had accepted alternative sentencing only a few times and 
never to this magnitude 
but then no one has ever volunteered to live in an aids 
hospice either said groff who recommended a prison term 
carter tentatively accepted pragers proposal to open an aids 
hospice and act as resident manager with his wife for five years 
after hearing several witnesses who work on aids projects in maine 
the judge said he had thought more about prager than he had 
about any other defendant during his years on the bench he called 
his decision supremely difficult 
prager 41 of yarmouth helped smuggle marijuana into maine at 
little deer isle during the summers of 1979 1980 and 1981 he was 
arrested in london last fall and was returned to maine where he 
pleaded guilty in january to charges of conspiracy possession and 
importation of marijuana 
pragers involvement in smuggling was a very serious offense 
against basic human decency carter said 
no one could answer the question of whether it is an 
acceptable tradeoff to permit someone to do something good for 
society rather than go to prison the judge said 
carter questioned several people who appeared in court on 
pragers behalf 
if i have anything to do with it he will not fail said dr 
michael bach an aids specialist at maine medical center we are 
in desperate need of a hospice and we will have one within six 
months if prager were allowed to proceed 
prager has been working with bach to help terminally ill aids 
patients 
carter said he was concerned about how the public would view 
pragers atonement for such a serious crime but dr owen b 
pickus also an aids specialist in portland said the public 
would not view this is an easyout option 
the judge also asked prager why he should not go to jail 
i have been given enormous gifts prager said although he 
squandered those gifts inexcusably he was confident he could 
make so much more of a contribution by going forward with this 
alternative sentencing proposal 
more than 20 other people connected with the smuggling operation 
have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years groff said 
he talked with several of them and none objected to pragers 
alternative sentence

hope ivy of fort walton beach 
nathan carpenter 4 was killed sept 23 by a large mixedbreed 
at nearby wynnhaven beach a neighbor had adopted the dog named 
chief about two hours earlier 
both dogs were from the panhandle animal welfare society known 
as paws 
im going to have the paws board review our adoption 
policy said the shelters executive director mike zoller at 
this point if someone tells us a dog has any history of any 
aggression were not going to put it in the adoption program 
zoller described chief as a lovable dog and said when chiefs 
owners dropped him off sept 12 they didnt mention any aggressive 
tendencies 
in the first attack chief escaped from his new owners yard and 
was found by the victims mother sharon kay carpenter she noticed 
the paws tag put the animal in her yard where her son was playing

the countrys leading producer of publicservice 
announcements released a national advertising campaign friday 
urging sexually active americans to use condoms to prevent the 
spread of aids 
us surgeon general c everett koop endorsed the campaign at a 
news conference noting that it may be controversial but calling on 
the media to carry it the three major television networks said 
they would 
the public service campaign of the advertising council may 
offend some people im truly sorry about that koop said you 
cannot ignore people who might not have your own morality 
critics of such advertising in the past have said it was 
preferable to stress abstinence and monogamy rather than the use 
of condoms to halt the sexual transmission of the aids virus 
koop however called abstinence not a viable option for most 
people and said many people also are not monogamous 
the ad council a notforprofit organization that has been 
producing public service promotions since 1942 has produced 
several highly successful public service campaigns such as the 
take a bite out of crime promotion 
at least two other national advertising campaigns have urged the 
use of condoms against aids one sponsored by the federal centers 
for disease control and another from the american medical 
association some of those ads were broadcast on network television 
the council sponsored by the advertising and communications 
industries distributes its ads to media outlets for use at their 
discretion 
this is not the first time we will be airing psas that deal 
with that subject directly said dom giofre nbcs spokesman 
what is significant here is that the ad council which is a 
major very thorough group is getting into this thing 
spokesmen for abc and cbs said they too would broadcast the 
announcements abc and nbc ran spots with a similar message last 
year but cbs did not cable news network spokesmen said they had 
not seen the spots yet 
the project includes three spots in english and spanish for 
television radio print and outdoor transit display 
in one tv ad a youth standing in the rain says my brother 
wouldnt listen to me i told him you have sex you use condoms 
so you dont get aids he laughed and said condoms werent macho 
the youth then crumples to a sitting position his back against 
a tombstone my brother he says he was so macho

the pilot of a hijacked brazilian 
jetliner said friday that he took his plane into a dive before 
landing in an effort to dislodge the hijackers gun 
the hijacker who killed a copilot and wounded three others 
before he was shot and captured thursday wanted to crash the vasp 
airlines boeing 737 a government building in the brazilian capital 
officials said he was hospitalized in stable condition friday 
authorities said 
raimundo conceicao 28 wounded three other crew members he 
held 98 passengers and another three crew members hostage for eight 
hours before police shot him as he walked toward a getaway plane 
with the pilot 
the pilot fernando murillo silva told tv globo on friday that 
before landing in the central city of goiania with only five 
minutes worth of fuel left i took the plane into a dive hoping 
the hijacker would fall on his head and release the gun 
conceicao stumbled but held on to the gun and pointed it at the 
pilots head 
as the plane landed at goianias santa genoveva airport 
conceicao shot and killed copilot salvador evangelista and wounded 
a flight engineer and a steward 
using his fingers to simulate the weapon silva described how 
the hijacker put the gun to the copilots head and pulled the 
trigger 
it was horrible he said 
a federal police spokesman paulo marro said the gunman 
probably will stand trial for homicide and for endangering the 
lives of those aboard 
marra said police did not have details on conceicaos 
background air force minister octavio moreira lima earlier called 
the hijacker a psychopath 
the hijacker told negotiators he wanted to settle accounts 
with the president over the countrys economic policies moreira 
lima said 
federal police chief romeu tuma said the hijacker told the 
control tower he wanted to slam the boeing 737 into a ministry 
building in brasilia 
inflation for this year is forecast at 800 percent under 
president jose sarney 
alcir pereira spokesman for the santa genoveva hospital in 
goiania said conceicao had been successfully operated on and was 
recovering he is out of danger he said

conceicao hijacked the twinengine jet minutes after it left the 
southeastern city of belo horizonte for rio de janeiro he barged 
into the cockpit and demanded that the pilot fly to brasilia 
after circling brasilia the pilot was told that because of 
security reasons he could not land there and the plane headed for 
goiania 125 miles away 
air force spokesman col eden avolinsque said sarney gave orders 
not to negotiate with the hijacker nor refuel the plane 
as hundreds of heavilyarmed police and army troops sealed off 
the goiania airport conceicao agreed to get off the airliner 
release the passengers and fly to brasilia on a small turboprop 
plane taking only the pilot as a hostage 
as the hijacker was walking toward the smaller plane special 
police agents fired and wounded him conceicao then spun around and 
shot silva wounding him in the leg

fewer than half the journalists who 
requested credentials for the discovery launch actually showed up 
and nasa on friday blamed new restrictions on access for the lower 
turnout 
there were many who told us they were not coming when they 
learned of the creation of a new press site on the causeway said 
a statement from the national aeronautics and space administration 
the new site provided a view more than 6 miles from the shuttle 
whereas the launch complex 39 press site is just over 4 miles away 
nasa said 2318 news people picked up their accreditation 
badges compared to the 5200 who requested credentials 
the final number on hand for the launch the first us manned 
spaceflight since the 1986 challenger disaster fell short of the 
record 2700 journalists who covered the apollo 11 and apollo 17 
moon missions and the first space shuttle flight 
because of air force studies following challenger that warned of 
casualties that could be caused by falling debris from another 
postlaunch accident air force officials responsible for range 
safety at kennedy space center recommended that only essential 
personnel be allowed at the main press complex 
veteran space journalists were angered by the restrictions 
which they feared could lead to future tightening of coverage 
allowed especially for secret military missions 
nasa and the air force finally compromised to allow 1800 news 
media representatives at the near site giving larger allotments to 
the news media with the tightest deadline pressures and need for 
staff the others had to watch from the causeway without telephone 
lines or computers at hand 
however jay barbree who has covered the space program for 
three decades for nbc news radio said he thought the discovery was 
one of the most extensively reported launches he said the amount 
of time its coverage was carried on the national networks was the 
most he could recall 
a lot of the people who get accredited are really coming here 
to watch so the tourists didnt come because of the restrictions 
but the working press covered it comprehensively barbree said 
reporters at the secondary site said their view was excellent 
but that their separation from communications equipment was a 
handicap

an experiment similar to shaking up 
oil and vinegar turned out to be more like mixing an egg white in 
an egg yolk when astronaut david c hilmers and fellow discovery 
crew members performed the test friday 
hilmers and george d pinky nelson spent part of the morning 
working on the experiment known as phase partitioning and some of 
their activities were broadcast on nasas satellite television 
channel 
its a little experiment that tries to look at the fluid 
dynamics of separating two different phases of materials hilmers 
said 
researchers hope the experiment will help them better understand 
the role gravity and other physical forces play in separating 
unmixable liquids during the experiment two polymers are 
dissolved in a saline solution and they then separate 
on earth the heavier material floats on top of the other but 
the outcome is much different in space where there is no gravity 
pinky and i have been shaking up this phase partitioning 
experiment its a lot like shaking up vinegar and oil in 0 g 
gravity it has a somewhat different mixing its more like an egg 
white in an egg yolk hilmers added and laughter followed from 
another astronaut 
in all there are 11 experiments the astronauts will conduct 
during their fourday mission including two student projects 
the first postchallenger flights main purpose to deploy a 
communications satellite was completed early friday when a 
twostage booster rocket pushed the satellite into its final orbit 
nasa grounded shuttles missions after the challenger exploded 
jan 28 1986 and the disaster also halted researchers efforts to 
test their theories in space for more than 2 years 
hilmers said the phase partitioning experiment was a good 
example of the need for manned spaceflights 
i guess one of the things this experiment can show is the 
use of people in space we can look at the experiment see if there 
are any unique changes and observe them we can take pictures as we 
see unique changes and possibly modify the experiment he said 
an experiment completed earlier friday was the aggregation of 
red blood cells which consists of blood samples donated by people 
with various illnesses such as cancer and diabetes 
during the experiment a pump flushes each blood sample through 
a system in an effort to study how red blood cells collect in 0 
gravity two 35mm cameras photograph the experiment and nelson 
said the device seemed to be working 
we could hear it whirling and taking pictures all night 
long he said

the deaths of three children and two teenagers in 
a house fire have been ruled homicides and investigators continuing 
seeking leads friday to the identity of the arsonist who started 
the blaze 
one of the victims of wednesdays blaze had earlier spoken about 
receiving threatening telephone calls his girlfriend said 
keyana thompson 14 a friend of victim bernard jordan said he 
told her that the caller once said im going to burn your house 
up and youre going to be in it 
jordan 16 became so fearful of the caller that he planned to 
leave town and left a note for thompson in case anything happened 
to him jordans friends and relatives said they did not know who 
was threatening him 
were checking out all those leads were trying to verify 
that dallas deputy fire chief tw oney said 
oney declined to say what evidence was gathered to lead to the 
arson ruling were talking to anyone thats got something to 
say weve picked up a lot of information he said 
he declined to say if there was a specific suspect 
the dallas county medical examiners office ruled the deaths 
homicides thursday 
oney said firefighters were hampered in their attempts to battle 
the blaze by antiburglary bars on the windows and a love seat 
pushed against the door 
we had to break in the house this was very tragic its worse 
because it is an arson situation and it was children said oney 
investigators said they werent sure if the love seat was 
purposely pushed against the door or if it was knocked there when 
the victims tried to escape investigators also found a charred 
1gallon gasoline can in the house it was purchased by the family 
recently for use with a lawn mower but was supposed to be on the 
porch officials said 
the father of one of the victims was arrested when he tried to 
run to her side in an ambulance

twentyseven pilots accused of lying about 
drug and drinking convictions on license applications were indicted 
friday in a government crackdown on unreported abuses among the 
nations pilots 
among those charged are 12 current or former commercial pilots 
including a pilot for delta air lines that pilot and a former pan 
american world airways pilot were the only ones identified as 
employees of major passenger airlines 
the indictments issued friday also named two student pilots 10 
private pilots and three others all but three are from florida 
these indictments are the first in a special nationwide 
project to vigorously pursue this abuse in a critical sector of 
the nations transportation system said us attorney robert 
genzman 
genzman said authorities knew of no mishaps involving those 
charged 
in washington transportation secretary jim burnley said 
hundreds of indictments were expected as a result of the nationwide 
investigation he said the charges were indicative of the serious 
problem of drug and alcohol abuse which has permeated all walks of 
life and all professions in our society 
the transportation department has proposed a broad range of drug 
tests including random tests of commercial airline pilots and 
other flight crew personnel 
a spokesman for the federal aviation administration said the 
past convictions would not have necessarily precluded the pilots 
from obtaining a medical certificate and pilots license 
but said spokesman fred farrar the fact that the applicants 
had past convictions for drug or alcoholrelated offenses would 
have caused an faa medical examiner to look long and hard at the 
circumstances 
fridays indictments were the result of a twoyear investigation 
that began with an audit of the national drivers registry to 
uncover alcohol or drugrelated traffic violations said ben lorigo 
of the department of transportation inspector generals office in 
washington 
painstaking computer checks of 711000 pilots around the country 
revealed 10200 had had driving privileges revoked in the previous 
seven years and 750 of them had failed to report it on the required 
faa medical forms he said at a news conference in tampa 
the 27 indicted friday if convicted on all charges could each 
face at least five years in prison and fines ranging from 5000 to 
250000 for making false statements to the faa on medical 
certificates 
the concealed convictions included drunken driving trafficking 
in cocaine and possession of marijuana 
genzman said there was an amnesty program within the last 
several years to allow those who had withheld information on their 
forms to come forward some did but the number was very low 
genzman said indicating to federal authorities the problem was 
widespread 
of the former and current commercial pilots charged lorigo said 
some may be retired or fly as a sideline and not as a career pilot 
the delta pilot fred kopec 27 of orlando was charged with 
failing to reveal a drunken driving arrest in lee county ala in 
january 1984 
delta spokeswoman jackie pate in atlanta confirmed kopec worked 
for the airline but said delta had not yet been formally notified 
of his indictment 
when delta is informed we will take the appropriate action 
which would be to suspend the pilot ms pate said 
another delta spokesman jim lundy said kopec has worked for 
delta for two years and is a second officer for l1011 jetliners 
kopec could not be reached for comment friday a telephone 
number in orlando for kopec could not be located

the safety of department of energy nuclear 
reactors came under heavy criticism at a congressional hearing 
friday with one department official comparing the situation to the 
illfated space shuttle challenger 
there are currently some senior managers within the department 
with an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face 
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program 
prior to the challenger accident said an internal memo released 
at the hearing 
the sept 16 memo was written by richard starostecki a deputy 
assistant secretary to his boss ernest baynard iii the assistant 
energy secretary for environment safety and health 
starostecki said the safety office staff is often challenged to 
prove that the departments reactors which produce nuclear 
materials for the department of defense are unsafe before 
officials will act on the offices concerns 
his memo did not identify the senior managers but it did say 
that secretary john herrington and deputy secretary joseph salgado 
had taken steps to overcome this attitude and lack of technical 
inquisitiveness 
this and other memos critical of the operations of department 
facilities were distributed at a joint hearing by the senate 
governmental affairs committee and the house government operations 
subcommittee on environment energy and natural resources 
the focus of the hearing was an incident in august when there 
was an unexpected power surge during the restarting of one of the 
reactors at the savannah river plant in south carolina 
witnesses said employees of the plants operator the du pont 
co ignored the surge caused by some partially activated tritium 
left in the reactor vessel and continued to power the reactor 
which eventually shut itself down 
the departments safety office and outside consultants later 
concluded that no procedures for such a situation had been 
established during the 30 years the plant has been operating 
dexter peach of the congressional general accounting office said 
there was no danger of the reactor going out of control but 
nobody knew it at the time 
this could have been another chernobyl if they had guessed 
wrong said sen john glenn dohio if i didnt know what was 
going on in a nuclear reactor i would shut it down 
asked to characterize the overall safety ethic at the savannah 
river plant robert keller a senior nuclear engineer with the 
safety office replied i would use the term seatofthepants 
or cavalier 
added robert smith the safety offices representative at the 
plant they do not have the technical understanding of basic 
principles to allow them to make a good decision to put the 
reactor in a safe condition if it was in an unsafe condition these 
operators do not have the knowledge 
the officials said that although westinghouse corp is taking 
over for du pont next year many of the control room people will be 
remaining on the job 
starostecki who said he lacked confidence in the control room 
personnel testified that had the power surge occurred at a 
commercial nuclear power plant federal rules would have required 
an immediate shutdown 
he said that in the last 17 years problems at savannah river 
reactors have forced about 9 to 12 shutdowns a year a commercial 
reactor would have difficulty with three or four a year he said 
he said inspections have turned up several hundred 
deficiencies at the plants p reactor and that portions of the 
plant have been operating in a very poor condition for years

gov buddy roemer said friday he cannot 
accept a pardon boards recommendation of a sixmonth sentence for 
a convicted killer who escaped from prison 18 years ago and built a 
new life in tennessee 
henry staggs who fled from a state prison at dequincy in 
southwestern louisiana in 1970 wound up in columbia tenn where 
he operated an auto repair ship as douglas gillette 
his freedom ended feb 5 when fbi agents arrested him 
when he escaped staggs had been serving a 15year sentence for 
manslaughter in the 1969 shooting death of a nightclub bouncer in 
port allen across the mississippi river from baton rouge 
the pardon board recommended the sixmonth sentence and five 
years of supervised parole for staggs 41 who is free on bond in 
tennessee 
roemer who can either accept or reject the boards 
recommendation said friday that he had returned the case to the 
board 
i was not comfortable with their recommendation just speaking 
very bluntly a human life was taken an escape from prison was 
involved he said that was offset in part from apparent good 
behavior over time i say apparent who knows but i was not happy 
with the decision and have returned it to the board for another 
look 
the governor did not indicate what recommendation he would 
accept saying he would work with the pardon board 
during a pardon board hearing staggs said he remembered almost 
nothing of the killing of george ballas he blamed the shooting on 
alcoholism that developed while he served in the army in the 1960s 
staggs said he decided to escape after learning of his fathers 
declining health in his home state of tennessee 
his wife bridget said she knew nothing of his past until his 
arrest she said he was dedicated to her and their three children 
the pardon board received letters and petitions from about 2000 
tennessee residents asking that staggs be allowed to remain free

the senate approved friday and sent president 
reagan a 466 billion agriculture money bill that limits a 
threeyearold export subsidy that has spurred overseas sales of 
us grain 
the bill approved 904 by the senate in the final congressional 
vote contains 466 billion in budget authority for a wide array 
of programs ranging from farm payments to food stamps 
the budget authority level was down from 562 billion last year 
while outlays under the bill would total only 269 billion 
farm appropriations often reflect a wide gap between budget 
authority and actual outlays for one thing the 88 billion 
earmarked for the governments commodity credit corp is really a 
reimbursement for a revolving fund and not counted as an outlay 
the commodity credit corp operates the agriculture departments 
major crop subsidy programs 
other bigticket items included in the measure 136 billion 
for food stamps 1929 billion for the nutrition program for 
women infants and children 148 billion for humanitarian food 
exports and 1864 billion for the conservation reserve program 
the conservation reserve program pays farmers to take highly 
erodible acreage out of crop production for a decade 
the measure provides for 770 billion under the export 
enhancement program the program makes inkind payments of surplus 
crops to exporters to send american wheat feed grains and other 
commodities overseas 
a substantial increase in sales is attributed to the program 
which was established under wideranging 1985 farm legislation in 
return the government has paid more than 2 billion worth of 
commodities to the worlds largest grain companies and other 
exporters 
the house in quest of budget savings had sought to cap the 
program at 900 million for the fiscal year getting under way 
saturday but housesenate conferees ended up adopting the senate 
level 
the bill also held to 200 million spending under the 1985 
targeted export assistance program it pays for advertising and 
other promotion of american agricultural products in overseas 
markets 
it had been authorized at 325 million in the upcoming fiscal 
year but appropriations committee lawmakers slashed out 125 
million after the program came under criticism within the house for 
using taxpayer funds to advertise specific brands of agricultural 
products 
the measure also attempts to close a loophole under which the 
nations commercial honey producers have been circumventing a limit 
of 250000 a year for any individual on gains through forfeiture 
of pricesupport loans 
under normal farm programs farmers use their crops for 
collateral to obtain the loans and then deliberately forfeit if 
that would yield them greater earnings than selling on the open 
market the commodity credit corp in effect becomes the buyer 
and supports a price set by the government rather than by the 
market 
lawmakers thought they had capped the benefits at 250000 
several years ago but the nations commercial beekeepers were able 
to find a perfectly legal route around the restriction 
the senate also sent the money bill to the president amid 
complaints about the job status of george dunlop the assistant 
secretary of agriculture for natural resources and environment 
dunlop got into a political rumpus with powerful house 
appropriations chairman jamie whitten dmiss and the panel 
erased dunlops job from the bill the senate refused to go along 
and the fate of the former aide to sen jesse helms rnc became 
a painful point between the two chambers 
meanwhile capitol hill wags produced lapel buttons that said 
save george dunlop 
the house was in effect trying to do away with his job and 
in effect to do away with him sen thad cochran rmiss said

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle took time out from staff briefings friday to raise money and 
tour a fire equipment exhibition before a weekend of mock debates 
leading up to his confrontation next week with democratic 
countrpart lloyd bentsen 
the indiana senator boarded his campaign plane clutching some 
briefing notebooks after a day in which he underwent questions and 
answers from his aides in what a spokesman said was a preliminary 
runthrough of the format for debate wednesday in omaha neb 
were ready quayle told reporters at the exhibition of fire 
engines fire boats and hooks and ladders 
in a reference to the media scrutiny he has faced since becoming 
george bushs running mate quayle told the audience of several 
hundred firefighters i want you all to know im very accustomed 
to putting out fires ive learned that in my trade 
we look forward to the competition of ideas in the debate 
ahead of us because were going to debate the future he said 
spokesman david prosperi said that on saturday quayle would 
conduct a formal mock debate with sen bob packwod rore who is 
standing in for bentsen in the debate preparations the sessions 
will be videotaped and quayle will review them over the weekened 
he is getting advice from roger ailes george bushs media guru 
who sat in on fridays sessions the sessions are being held at an 
undisclosed office building in the washington area 
aides say the strategy for the debate will be to concentrate on 
michael dukakis not on his running mate 
i think bentsen has to try and explain the positions of his 
running mate and convince the viewing audience and others that 
dukakis is in the mainstream prosperi said bentsen is not the 
issue the issue is the qualifications of his running mate 
the circle of aides that participated in fridays briefings 
included stuart spencer quayles campaign manager ken khachigian 
his speechwriter jim cicconi his research director mitch 
daniels former white house political director prosperi and ailes

step toward landing people on mars 
the cotton soaked with saliva which will be analyzed later on 
the ground is part of a major new nasa effort to determine how to 
keep people healthy while living in space for many months 
dr michael w bungo a researcher in space medicine said the 
medical community will have to gather a vast body of new knowledge 
before it is clear that humans will be able to sustain the stresses 
and physical changes that a twoyear voyage to mars would require 
we know the human body changes in space but we dont know if 
it could adapt to 24 months of weightlessness that would be require 
for a mars voyage he said right now we are only confident 
that people can stay in space safely for about 180 days

two companies are trying to add some glitter to the drab copper 
and ironore mining scene of far northern michigan 
it started as a glint in a dow chemical co metallurgists eye 
first dow and now a colorado company crystal exploration inc 
entered the search for diamonds in the states upper peninsula 
seven kimberlite pipes volcanic rock shafts that can yield the 
earths hardest mineral have been discovered 
core drilling has unearthed a scattering of sandgrain sized 
diamonds too few and too small for commercial production but the 
explorers say the search is young 
the pipe formations are in a 40mile area around iron mountain 
and crystal falls at the western end of the upper peninsula along 
the wisconsin border 
in the few places on earth they are found kimberlite pipes 
occur in clusters of up to several dozen said james huml a dow 
research associate 
huml a metallurgist by trade and geologist by avocation said 
he thinks there are more than a dozen kimberlite pipes in the upper 
peninsula 
dow has searched for six years now more exploration and mining 
expertise is needed huml said dow is not a hardrock mining 
company 
dow recently sold its mineral leases and geological data for an 
undisclosed amount to crystal exploration inc a colorado 
subsidiary of sydney australias restech international ltd 
restech has mineral exploration and gold mining operations in 
western australia 
it will carry on the search while dow holds onto an option to 
take part in the exploration and development and to share in any 
profits 
occasional diamond finds in ohio farm fields in the late 1800s 
and early 1900s long had geologists looking to te north said 
crystal explorations president sigfried muessig 
muessig said a kimberlite pipe named for kimberly in the 
diamondmining region of south africa is the only formation known 
to produce the gems 
it is a cylindrical formation where volcanic rock has come up 
120 miles from the bowels of the earth and the heat and pressure 
have formed the diamonds he said 
its a very rare occurrence huml said other kimberlite 
pipes have been found in arkansas kansas wyoming and colorado 
none commercially produce diamonds 
there were no volcanic remnants in ohio so geologists thought 
glaciers carried the diamonds there from canada muessig said 
but he said the focus shifted in 1981 when the us geological 
survey found a kimberlite formation the lake ellen pipe about 
10 miles northeast of crystal falls 
it was evidence that volcanoes smoked and spewed nearly 200 
million years ago in the upper peninsula and possibly generated 
the heat and compression forces to leave a diamond treasure behind 
the glaciers flattened the volcanoes but since 1981 dow has 
found six more kimberlite pipes several hundred feet across at 
the surface and covered by volcanic debris huml said 
in dows explorations he said we have found microdiamonds 
generally small less than a millimeter in diameter they are 
grainsized 
but the explorers still think the western upper peninsula was 
the source of the gems found in farm fields to the south we 
think there is good potential because of the historical finds 
muessig said 
crystal exploration will do more sampling in the already 
discovered pipes in the next year muessig said and will continue 
exploring for more kimberlite formations in hopes the next pipe 
we discover will have gemquality stones

singersongwriter toni childs leafs through 
a stack of press clippings comparing her favorably to joan 
armatrading phoebe snow janis ian tracy chapman suzanne vega 
miriam makeba and laura nyro 
shes been seeing a lot of stories like that since her first 
album union was released by aampm records in the spring 
i can give you more she says with a sublime smile and a 
hint of frustration grace slick bette midler annie lennox 
janis joplin every female that anybodys ever liked i think 
the smile reflects her unswaying confidence that new singers 
will one day be compared with toni childs the frustration suggests 
the comparisons are flattering but imprecise 
using images that flow sometimes subconsciously from her own 
extraordinary experiences and a songwriting style that relies more 
on intuition than technique childs has set herself apart from the 
current crowd of women singers 
for one thing she says she often writes and performs in a 
trance 
half a lifetime ago the 30yearold singer left an unhappy home 
for a journey that took her through a northern california commune 
federal prison europe and the arms of musician david ricketts she 
moved in with ricketts in 1985 on the day she signed her contract 
with aampm and shortly before ricketts and david baerwald hit it big 
with david amp davids highly successful boomtown album 
the love affair failed but the painful breakup inspired several 
of the songs of selfdiscovery on union and she and ricketts 
remain close friends they worked together on childs first album 
and she said he will play a big role in her second 
childs is planning to travel with ricketts to africa bali and 
india in search of tones that will shape her second lp they 
have already begun work on some new songs but she said the themes 
and most melodies will be a product of her upcoming trek 
all i know is that there are certain places i want to go 
because of the tones that im being drawn there because of the 
tones the tones always dictate to me whats really going on so 
im going to be true to that for whereever its going to take me 
she said in an interview 
maybe thats a really cosmic way of doing it but the tones 
hit parts of me that make me release things or make me see things 
or maybe make me ask the questions that i wouldnt ordinarily ask 
and then i get answers that i find out for me 
she not only instinctively selects her destinations but relies 
on instinct when writing her songs a process which has as much to 
do with solving private mysteries as with making music 
your subconcious speaks to you really strongly and when 
youre doing something like music its like dream time and 
its good to kind of pay attention to it she said 
although her songs often sound like poems set to music only one 
song from the first album zimbabwe actually started out 
that way the others extended from improvising with ricketts on a 
combination of groove and melody and mood 
you just kind of get in this trance with it and then these 
words start coming out and for me the challenge is to find out 
what im telling myself she said it unlocks some sort of 
side of you that sometimes you might not have the courage to take a 
look at 
that sort of spontaneity doesnt always translate well to a 
stage performance but childs drew ovations at san franciscos 
famed fillmore auditorium as she rocked through powerful versions 
of songs that sounded more gentle on the album no wonder the 
comparisons to joplin slick and lennox 
my sort of thing is to get in my trance she said of her 
live shows to go back to the same place that the song 
actually originally came from thats my goal 
although her introspective lyrics often haunt her childs 
said her music has been most important to her as a way of looking 
at her life 
you know on a pressure cooker it has that little place where 
the steam escapes she said well thats been my out a way 
to take a look at my life and the mistakes ive made the choices 
ive made or what choices i want to make 
thats really what the musics about

host david mccullough promises there will be no 
quiz after the new american history series american experience 
there are no lessons its never pedantic its never preachy 
no dates to memorize none of the sort of horror sense that many 
people have about history he said 
its my experience that if you simply tell what happened it 
is so fascinating it is so human that you dont have to sugarcoat 
the pill you dont have to devise means to bring people into the 
subject theyll come in because theres nothing more interesting 
than what happened to people and thats all history is 
the first installment in the anthology series premiering on the 
public broadcasting service on tuesday is the great san 
francisco earthquake a fascinating film produced by tom 
weidlinger and narrated by f murray abraham it incorporates rare 
footage taken just after the 1906 disaster as well as presentday 
interviews with people who were there and compelling still 
photographs 
the film captures the vastness of the biggest natural disaster 
to ever befall a north american city but also the essence of good 
ol american pluck 
in one of the stills a chalked message is scrawled on a lone 
standing wall amid the rubble bill mcclure will find family at 
west berkeley another hastily constructed sign in front of a 
toppled building says a little disfigured but still in the ring 
men wanted 
these films which is why im so excited about the series 
these films are often extremely moving said mccullough you 
can look up any past event in the encyclopedia or the almanac or a 
history textbook but theres no feeling these films have feeling 
and you vicariously become part of the experience 
the series underwritten by aetna has been funded for two 
years though the producers are hoping it will catch on and last a 
long time as soon as viewers realize its a hodgepodge of tales 
about individual events and people not chapters from a textbook 
we want to say certain things to the viewer very much the 
first year said executive producer judy crichton we want to 
say we are eclectic we are going to tell you stories about the 
past like geronimo and were going to tell you stories about the 
near present were going to tell you stories that resonate in 
terms of contemporary life and were going to do it in a number of 
different forms 
the second film on oct 11 is radio bikini an academy 
awardnominated documentary about the atom bomb tests on bikini 
atoll in the south pacific 
the story of angie debo a historian who revealed injustices 
against oklahoma indians will be told in the oct 18 installment 
indians outlaws and angie debo 
on oct 25 theres a nice essay by cbs commentator eric 
sevareid who describes his physical and intellectual journey from 
the isolated heartland of america to involvement in a war against 
fascism in europe an individual metamorphosis that also mirrored a 
societal change of heart 
mccullough author of such bestselling and awardwinning 
histories as the path between the seas about the panama canal 
and mornings on horseback a biography of young theodore 
roosevelt finds the link between film and history a natural one 
i got involved in writing history because of photography he 
said because of visual images i saw some photographs one time 
which got me interested in the subject which led to my writing a 
book on the subject so i know when these imaginative and talented 
people start nosing around in archives of old films and old still 
photography theyre going to tell us things reveal aspects of our 
nature as a people that we havent even thought about before 
the reason most people arent interested in history he 
said is theyve either had teachers or read books by people who 
arent interested in people and theres nothing more interesting 
in the world than our fellow human beings and the fact that these 
human beings lived in a different time from us doesnt mean that we 
should be cut off from them

his poetry reflected the anguish of life and his 
pessimism was viewed archly by some still ts eliot was embraced 
by the world as one of the major 20th century poets in the english 
language 
this year his centenary year has witnessed an outpouring of 
celebrations for the late nobelist who himself considered william 
butler yeats the greatest poet of our time 
thomas stearns eliot was born in st louis on sept 26 1888 he 
lived in london from 1914 and became a british citizen in 1927 he 
won the nobel prize in literature in 1948 and died in london on 
jan 4 1965 his poetic gift was extraordinary from the 
despairing early works the love song of j alfred prufrock 
the waste land to his later more hopeful visions such as 
ash wednesday and four quartets 
he also was a critic and dramatist and his plays include 
murder in the cathedral the family reunion and the 
cocktail party

irish poet seamus heaney considered one of the outstanding living 
englishlanguage poets is giving the major festival lecture called 
on learning from eliot 
quotations from eliot like the skull beneath the skin and 
in my end is my beginning are found everywhere in literature and 
the arts you dont realize how much other poets and playwrights 
have used him said festival director tim sargeant 
eliot in his centenary year was the obvious choice for the 
festival and he appeals to such a wide range of people 
he wrote poems for children as well as the deep and involved 
poetry of the waste land his old possums book of practical 
cats is the basis of andrew lloyd webbers musical cats eliot 
was affected by music and composers in their turn have been 
affected by him sargeant said

however centenary celebrations were marred by a protest over 
three distinguished jews including oxford philosopher sir isaiah 
berlin lending their names to a trust fund appeal in eliots name 
by the london library of which he was president 
critics recalled the antisemitic expressions in some of eliots 
poetry and letters 
in the 1927 poem burbank with a baedeker bleistein with a 
cigar eliot wrote the rats are underneath the piles the jew 
is underneath the lot 
the poet also said in a lecture in january 1933 as adolf hitler 
was about to take power in germany reasons of race or religion 
combine to make any large number of freethinking jews undesirable 
and a spirit of excessive tolerance is to be deprecated 
 
some critics say eliot in time put aside antisemitism and that 
it had no role in his later life 
eliot is much in favor these days because his ideas are now 
fashionable said poet harry gilonis he was a classicist a 
monarchist an anglocatholic and very conservative while in his 
poetry he was a modernist attacked in his day for pessimism and 
formlessness 
eliot wasnt appreciated by the public then but he is admired 
now and with paperbacks for a mass market more and more people 
are reading his work

the bbc stressed that while eliots pessimism has been much 
criticized when he was at the height of his powers europe was in 
political torment and doubt was cast on the very survival of the 
continents civilization 
newspapers have run a steady stream of articles about eliots 
poetry and what the times of london called his messy bewildering 
and unpredictable life eliots first wife vivien haighwood 
constantly complained of being ill and was eventually committed to 
a mental institution 
but the times said in an editorial that eliot was still an 
inspiration for justifying and reinforcing european culture 
which was for him a congregation of ideas and values 
the centenary eve saw a memorial service in st michaels 
church east coker the somerset village home of eliots ancestors 
who went to america and where his ashes are interred he 
immortalized east coker in four quartets eliot joined the

its first catalog included his poems from 190925 
his books have sold in millions around the world and the 
numbers are incalculable said joan mackle a publicist at faber

actress helen mirren like thousands of 
britons before her traveled to the seaside spa of bournemouth to 
inspect the little cottage where the murder took place 53 years ago 
mirrens visit to the house beside the english channel was 
different from those of the merely curious she was researching her 
role as accused murderess alma rattenbury in cause celebre 
which can be seen on pbs mystery in two parts thursday and 
oct 20 
rattenbury 38 was accused along with her teenage lover 
george bowman of bludgeoning her elderly husband to death in 1935 
their trial in londons old bailey caused a sensation and 
rattenbury was widely reviled in england 
i went to the house and i could feel the terrible trauma the 
people felt said mirren the house hasnt changed its 
character since the tragedy took place bournemouth is a very 
middle class bourgeois narrowminded smug town 
ever since the little house in bournemouth has drawn the 
curious who still seek out the house and visit the cemetery in 
search of the unmarked graves 
francis rattenbury is buried apart from his wife she was 
acquitted of the charge of murder but within days stabbed herself 
four times in the heart bowman was sentenced to death but the 
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment he served seven years 
bowman now 72 still lives in bournemouth 
i think i feel more strongly about cause celebre than any 
other piece of work ive done said mirren she has starred in 
such movies as white nights excalibur age of consent 
the mosquito coast 2010 the fiendish plot of dr fu 
manchu and the new release pascalis island she recently 
completed an asyet untitled movie with paul scofield 
she has also acted extensively on the stage in her native 
england where one critic called her the sex bomb of the royal 
shakespeare company 
when you do shakespeare as ive done often she said you 
work on an epic scale of emotions but to do all that and know it 
actually happened is quite something crimes of passion involving 
ordinary people are fascinating you cant identify with 
psychopaths but you get caught up in stories about real people 
you feel a sense of responsibility bringing back to life someone 
whose life i feel close to 
i loved alma the woman who now lives in her house loves her 
in the same way the only people who reviled her were the people 
who didnt know her people hated alma because she had an affair 
with a man 20 years younger women especially were afraid of that 
element in her and felt she should be punished 
mirren says her research has convinced her that alma rattenbury 
did not participate in the murder 
she instigated it because of what she was she said alma 
and george were tried together but each confessed to the crime and 
said the other was innocent she was tried only because she

michael caine in period costume of long sideburns 
and tweed coat settles into a victorian chair in the quiet drawing 
room of the 18thcentury mansion 
its an appropriately chilly rainy london day but the next 
room is blazing bright under the quite 20thcentury lights of the 
movie company filming cbs jack the ripper 
the twopart miniseries airing friday and sunday oct 21 and 
23 marks the centennial of the grisly unsolved serial killings 
writerdirector david wickes used scotland yard files that had been 
sealed for a century to develop a theory of the killers identity 
that will be revealed at the end of the film 
the miniseries is caines first television role in more than 20 
years his first on american tv 
the last time he did television at all caine recalls he 
costarred with christopher plummer in a british production of 
hamlet 
of course i didnt play hamlet in that this time i do he 
says with mock smugness 
he plays the central character in the drama scotland yard 
inspector frederick abberline the miniseries costars armand 
assante and jane seymour 
caine said he was completely disinterested in returning to tv 
until the miniseries genre came along 
over a period of time the miniseries had become a very valid 
way of filming things that wouldnt fit into an hour and 50 minutes 
or two hours and 10 in the movies he said and so therefore 
it gained a lot of prestige as far as i was concerned where you 
could do good stuff rather than just television slop 
i wouldnt have done it if it had been done with five tv 
cameras and everybody rushing around trying to change velcro suits 
because i did all that thats what i remembered television as 
because i did about a hundred shows different plays live on 
television and all i remember is a very inefficient nightmare and 
if you remembered all the dialogue you were a genius never mind if 
you got the performance that didnt make any difference 
then this script came along which i liked particularly and 
it was a kind of definitive jack the ripper because we do catch 
the guy theres been a lot of jack the ripper movies but theres 
never been an ending now weve got the real ending 
jack the ripper was the nickname for the unknown killer who 
stalked and eviscerated five east london prostitutes the killings 
came to an abrupt end on nov 9 1888 the identity of the ripper 
according to wickes theory will be revealed when the 
americanbritish coproduction airs in england oct 18 until then 
even caine wont know the ending because wickes filmed four 
different ones 
abberline diligently investigated the ripper case but never made 
an arrest wickes maintains he was thwarted by a coverup that 
extended to the highest offices of the land 
caine found abberline to be a very tenacious bulldog copper 
kind of rough he wasnt adverse to smacking someone around in the 
cells or anything like that to get what he wanted if he figured 
they were villains 
caine had recently finished playing another detective a comical 
version of sherlock holmes in the movie without a clue due out 
this month ben kingsley plays watson who in this premise has 
invented sherlock holmes as a front when forced to produce him he 
hires a neerdowell actor caine to play the part 
working on without a clue and jack the ripper in england 
allowed caine to help his family adjust to their recent move back 
to his homeland after nine years in los angeles caine 55 was 
born maurice micklewhite in a cockney district of london he 
decided to leave los angeles after wearying of the monotonous 
weather that prevented him from fully indulging his passion for 
gardening 
later caine was off to the south of france to costar with 
steve martin in dirty rotten scoundrels which he described as 
a comedy about two not very efficient con men trying to live off 
old ladies 
in 1987 he starred in two british spy thrillers the fourth 
protocol for which he was executive producer and the whistle 
blower he also starred in the critically acclaimed 1983 british 
film educating rita and had a supporting role in mona lisa 
in 1986 but much of caines success had been in american movies 
among them too late the hero the man who would be king 
sleuth and jaws iv the revenge 
his supporting role in woody allens 1986 best picture hannah 
and her sisters won him his first oscar after three previous 
nominations caine said he would like to work with allen again but 
has no idea if the reclusive director liked him enough to write him 
into another film even after winning an academy award for the 
picture 
that doesnt matter to him at all he doesnt believe in 
them caine said adding over his shoulder as he headed back to 
the set probably because i won the oscar he wont give me 
another part

an associated press correspondent based in 
london gathered material for this story on a bicycle getting about 
the way many people do on the aran islands in irelands galway bay 
it is one of a series of periodic dispatches by associated press 
correspondents on life and customs in the byways of the world 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the people out here in galway bay 
are often thought of as the most irish of the irish thats because 
they havent changed much from the past even though telephones 
television tourists and airplanes leave them less isolated 
an outsider touring on a bicycle soon finds that out 
the ride across inishmore the largest of the aran islands 
began brightly at noon but fittingly irish the lowering mist 
brought a soft rain that fell ceaselessly until nightfall 
the sprightly pony traps twowheeled carriages lined up near 
the harbor at kilronan inishmores main village would have been 
more comfortable so would one of the tour buses that hurtle along 
the narrow roads 
but to get the real flavor of life in the gray labyrinth of 
centuriesold limestone walls the bicycle works best for a 
closeup view of the remnants of an ancient gaelic culture that has 
largely vanished on the irish mainland 
the incursion of modern appliances has left the 1300 islanders 
largely unchanged and the government keeps the irish language alive 
here by paying families to speak it 
the playwright jm synge who made his reputation with his rich 
dialogue sketches of aran peasant life wrote in 1907 that here 
one is forced to believe in a sympathy between man and nature 
the aran archipelago inishmore inishmaan and inisheer 
stretches across the mouth of galway bay in western ireland it 
attracts a steady flow of visitors strainseiri strangers to 
the islanders 
when christianity was dawning in ireland the islands were a 
retreat for ascetics and scholars and even today schoolchildren 
academics and civil servants arrive every summer to immerse 
themselves among the islanders 
the treeless landscape of rainpolished limestone is strewn with 
granite boulders scored with deep fissures adorned with 437 known 
species of wild flowers the walls separating patches of green 
pasture are stippled with orange lichen 
the land bounded by wavepounded craggy cliffs is littered 
with prehistoric forts crosses stone huts and ecclesiastical 
ruins inishmore has one main road 
theres nothing on inishmore but scenery and people said 
doreen meagher a dublin drama teacher who has owned a house here 
since 1967 theres nothing laid on for you no hurdygurdy no 
concerts or theater just fresh air unpolluted water lovely 
scenery 
theyre a race apart and will never integrate she said of 
the islanders theyre frightfully clannish they must have got a 
talkingto by the tourist board theyre more friendly this year 
than they have been 
indeed the islanders seem to have plenty to say often 
switching from irish to english in midsentence the government 
pays child and housing allowances to families whose children are 
fluent in irish 
while aran traditions might be under assault the strong 
community spirit remains intact fishermen still use currachs 
canvascovered boats or fish from the high cliffs with twine on a 
stick 
but no longer do they clamber down cliffs at night to snatch 
sleeping puffins for their feathers aran sweaters are still 
handknitted and snapped up by tourists but the brownsailed 
hookers that carried turf from connemara are gone as are the 
rope makers basket weavers and coopers 
most people still live off fishing and farming but tourism is 
slowly filling kilronan with bedandbreakfast guesthouses 
restaurants gift shops and pubs named lucky star or american bar 
where budweiser beer is available alongside irish stout 
a civic hall offers the tourists daily screenings of man of 
aran the vivid 1934 portrait of inishmore by robert flaherty an 
american pioneer of film documentary 
on the smaller island of inishmaan stands synges chair 
slabs of rock arranged on the cliffside spot where the playwright 
had written of perpendicular cliffs under my ankles and over me 
innumerable gulls that chase each other in a white cirrus of 
wings 
once on the eightmile uphill road out of kilronan the 
windswept barrenness becomes complete visitors walk the last mile 
of rocky land to dun aenghus a prehistoric fort with three 
concentric enclosures on the edge of a 300foot cliff where the 
relentless rain seeps through every layer of clothing 
the forts keeper had retreated to dirianes pub where between 
sips of guinness stout he taught two soaked german tourists to say 
its a wet day in irish is la fliuch e pronounced iss law 
floouck ay 
in the american bar 85yearold antoine obriain welcomed a 
newcomer with a knucklebumpy handshake 
in my youth we always used to be out on the ocean he said 
speaking irish through an interpreter he recalled how in world war 
ii german uboats would surface inside rings of currachs to evade 
radar detection by british warships and uboat crews would be fed 
tea and sandwiches 
there isnt anybody here who hasnt had someone who drowned 
said lobsterman michael joyce 35 
four of his 13 classmates have died at sea but joyce said he 
would live nowhere else because only here can he raise his four 
children his own way 
here its a whole village he said if you have a 
problem you tell it to the first person you meet in the morning 
breandan o heithir 58 welcomes the modern conveniences 
electricity tv telephones motorcycles in place of donkeys 
what i see vanishing is picturesque stuff that appeals to 
tourists but really the people are surprisingly unchanged in their 
attitudes said o heithir an inishmore native and columnist for 
the irish times a dublinbased national newspaper 
in his youth the highlight was the arrival of the galway ferry 
on wednesdays and saturdays now ferryboats make the 10mile 
crossing from connemara every hour or two and aer arann flies 
daily to all the islands 
it can be black enough the whole business of isolation o 
heithir said but the isolation is gone now and thats a good 
thing

with little advertising and less fanfare the 
ford probe is speeding through dealer showrooms keeping most 
buyers waiting at least six weeks for delivery of a car that may be 
carving its own market niche 
since its formal introduction last may the probe built beside 
the mazda mx6 at mazda motor manufacturing usa corps flat rock 
plant south of detroit is being sold three months in advance of 
assembly line runs ford motor co analyst ray windecker said 
delivery time can vary depending on what kind and color 
automobile a customer wants 
the american carbuying public got a dose of what ford had in 
mind months before its formal introduction the news media 
specifically the automotive magazines sang the cars praises 
by the time the cars were introduced more than onethird of 
the carbuying age populous was aware of the car windecker said 
i dont think theres been that much excitement about a 
domestic car since a taurus another ford that was introduced in 
december 1985 said beth fusco an auto analyst with moodys 
investor services in new york city 
they did a lot of advance promotion for the car in 
magazines she said i thought that was a pretty sophisticated 
sendoff i think they did a good job promoting it and i think the 
car is selling itself 
probes base price is 11490 with a 22 liter fourcylinder 
engine the car with hidden headlamps and a sweptback rear deck 
can be upgraded with a turbocharged engine and option packages to 
17292 
earlier this summer scores of probes reached the end of the 
assembly line at flat rock needing repairs 
mazda quality control manager james g bouck said the quality 
problems were created when a second shift was added at the plant 
a jointventure between ford and mazda and some workers were 
retrained and moved from one shift to another 
bouck who moved to mazda from general motors corp said mazda 
has more stringent quality demands that some other automakers that 
can result in more cars landing in repair lots before being shipped 
to dealers 
our repair inventory is about 300 now he said calling it 
an expected number 
probe sales have grown at a steady clip about 600 cars more 
are sold each month than in the preceding one no one at ford would 
reveal projected sales figures but windecker said demand has 
outstripped those projections 
its too early to tell exactly where probe will fit into the 
american car market 
they are creating a different niche for themselves fusco 
said but she cautioned i think you have to be really careful 
when youre creating a niche 
look what gm did with fiero she said referring to the 
pontiac twoseater that sold well in its first few years on the 
market before falling off dramatically gm stopped making the car 
earlier this year 
analysts said the probe has capitalized on the no 2 and most 
profitable automakers strengths solid design careful marketing 
and reliability 
they have done many things right said richard henderson an 
analyst with the pershing division of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette in new york city its a combination of many many 
little factors some borrowed from europe some from north america 
and some borrowed from mazda 
combine that with a nice fit in its product mix and youve 
got a very successful car henderson said 
like other newly introduced cars probes engineering initially 
may take a back seat to its looks 
what is there out there in that price range that looks that 
neat asked fusco i think people buy cars because they look 
good and secondarily because the quality is good and the warranty 
is good 
like other fords probe carries a oneyear bumpertobumper 
warranty and a sixyear 60000mile powertrain warranty

the nations automakers and suppliers are 
offering a growing array of antitheft devices in an effort to stem 
the growing number of stolen vehicles 
most of the devices marketed by the big three honda mazda 
nissan and toyota involve alarms that honk the horn and flash the 
headlights to scare off a wouldbe car thief others systems 
disengage starter motors 
most of the devices supplied by automakers as standard equipment 
come on the makers more expensive cars the systems are optional 
on many lessexpensive models 
then there are devices that an owner can pick up at a local auto 
parts store things that fit around the steering column like a big 
doughnut menacinglooking hooks that lock the steering wheel to 
the brake pedal and still other systems that detect motion and 
sound such as breaking glass 
despite all the technology put into antitheft systems by 
automakers and parts suppliers there was a 53 percent rise in the 
number of car thefts in the nation from 1986 to 1987 the latest 
annual figures available from the fbi 
and the national auto theft bureau in chicago says while those 
devices may stymie thieves most of the cars stolen nowadays fall 
into two categories cars in which keys were left in the ignition 
and cars that were simply towed away 
approximately 13 percent of the recovered stolen vehicles 
still had the owners keys in the vehicles said tim kett of 
the organization about 10 percent of the vehicles were towed 
this is a common technique used by thieves in urban areas 
when tow trucks arent used by thieves there are a variety of 
products offered outside dealerships designed to keep a drivers 
car where the driver left it 
collars that cover ignition switches and joints in steering 
columns can prevent the plastic covering from being easily removed 
exposing wiring for the column controls including the ignition 
alarms that sound when a door is pried open when windows are 
smashed or when the car moves also are available 
motion detectors have caused some headaches especially in 
heavily urban areas when they can be activated by a nudge from a 
passerby or another vehicle for instance 
aaron lowe director of government affairs for the vehicle 
security association a trade organization for makers and marketers 
of alarm and vehicle protection systems said the security industry 
is beginning to make more sophisticated and lesssensitive motion 
detectors 
there are some systems available in the aftermarket which can 
alert a driver through a pager that someone may be trying to get 
into a car there are systems which interrupt the electrical or 
fuel systems when a door hood or trunk is opened 
there are a wide range of things a consumer can get depending 
on where they are and what they want to protect lowe said

the likelihood of injury from a car accident 
ranges widely among different car models but for the most part 
safety increases with automobile size according to an insurance 
industry report 
the report on injury claims involving 207 popular models shows 
that small cars have by far the highest injury loss records while 
station wagons and large cars often afford the greatest protection 
according to the insurance group the mercedesbenz sdlsel 
sedan which is equipped with a driverside airbag had the best 
safety record with injury losses that were 58 percent lower than 
the average for all cars close behind was the pontiac safari 
station wagon 
the least safe car was the 4door chevrolet spectrum which had 
injury losses that were 78 percent above average followed by the 
4door chevrolet sprint and 4door hyundai excel both of which had 
losses 67 percent above average the report said 
of the 10 cars with the best injury loss record nine were 
categorized as large cars including five station wagons and 
vans the saab 9000 was the only midsize car in the top 10 
vehicles ranking fifth best with injury losses 51 percent lower 
than average 
the 10 vehicles with the worst injury loss record were all in 
the small sedan or small sports car category 
exceptions to the general trend that small cars afford the least 
protection include another saab model the saab 900 as well as the 
volkswagen vanagon the toyota van porsche 944 coupe and mercedes 
benz 380560 sl convertible all are in the small category but 
had better than average injury loss records 
but except for the saab 900 all 60 of the small sedan 
models had higher injury losses than average 
the report by the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group covered 198587 model cars but spokesmen 
said the findings can be used as a guide for later model vehicles 
as well 
the loss experience of most cars is consistent from one model 
year to another said brian oneill the institutes president 
the report said the results were adjusted to take into account 
various nonvehicle factors such as types and ages of drivers 
that might be associated with particular vehicles 
the 2door chevrolet cavalier was the only midsize car to have 
substantially worse than average injury losses 36 percent 
worse than average for all vehicles 
all but two of the 35 large cars station wagons vans and 
speciality cars had lower than average injury losses the 4door 
oldsmobile delta 88 and cadillac fleetwooddeville were the 
exceptions ranked as average 
of the 207 cars and vans included in the study 40 had safety 
records that were characterized as substantially better than 
average while 32 were substantially worse

here are the cars ranked as having 
substantially better and substantially worse injury loss 
records according to the highway loss data institute an insurance 
industry research group 
these vehicles have injury loss records of at least 30 percent 
greater or 30 percent less than the average for the 207 vehicles 
examined 
the number in parenthesis after each vehicle represents the 
relative injury loss rate the lower the number the better the loss 
rate 100 is the average for all vehicles for example a 40 would 
mean a loss rate of 60 percent below average a 140 would be a loss 
rate of 40 percent greater than average

driving speed will not have much effect on tire performance or 
wear according to test engineers at goodyear tire amp rubber co 
in terms of getting from point a to point b the increase in 
speed will compress the time needed to make the trip but it wont 
have any appreciable effect on either tire wear or performance 
unless you engage in sharp cornering braking or similar maneuvers 
at high speed says walt devinney director of tire testing 
goodyear also had this advice 
cold air pressure readings on your tires should not exceed 
the maximum air pressure specified on the tire sidewall 35 pounds 
per square inch on most cars tire inflation checks should be made 
often 
tires on automobiles and light trucks should be rotated at 
6000 to 8000 miles and again at 18000 to 24000 miles except 
when the manufacturer advises otherwise rotation usually will mean 
more even treadwear says goodyear 
all four tires should be of the same type of construction 
except winter tires on drive wheels or temporary spares supplied 
with the wheels 
if replacing tires and you need only two mount the newest and 
besttreaded on the drive wheels

with winter and its rain snow sleet and subfreezing 
temperatures in the offing car care becomes especially important 
motorists are advised to have a professional technician check 
for signs of wear on the car 
walt alley director of training at the midas insitute of 
technology in palatine ill suggests checking these car service 
areas 
brakes checks brake pads and shoes for wear 
exhaust system look for holes in the muffler exhaust or 
tailpipe 
oil and lube use the proper winter weight motor oil and give 
your car a lube job to help protect suspension and steering parts 
shocks wornout shock absorbers can hinder braking 
especially during sudden stops and allow excessive body rolls on 
curves 
alley also suggests assembling a winter survival kit to keep 
in the trunk to include booster cables shovel tow chain rock 
salt or sand emergency flares flashlight and firstaid kit 
racing driver alan kulwicki advises car owners also check tires 
the gas tank running out of gas and flat tires and the two 
leading nonmechanical causes of highway breakdowns he says and 
antifreeze 
check your antifreeze to make sure both that you have enough 
and that the system is clean says kulwicki who drives his own 
racing cars for the zerex racing team a good habit to get into 
is to check the antifreeze every time you check the oil especially 
if youve been driving hard 
always be sure the ignition is off and the engine cold when 
opening the radiator he says 
if the coolant looks dirty he says have the cooling system 
flushed and replace the antifreeze if the level is low add some 
a 5050 mix of antifreeze and water usually provides the best 
protection against overheating kulwicki says

many motorists who wear seat belts are still 
exposing themselves to serious injury by wearing them improperly 
according to a federal study that says women children and 
motorists over 50 are most likely to put themselves at risk 
the national transportation safety board study raised questions 
bout the way some belt users wear the safety devices after 
examining 167 accidents in which at least one occupant was belted 
twentyone percent of the motorists wearing belts had too much 
slack in the shoulder harnesses and 7 percent of the occupants 
often children wore belts that were improperly routed behind the 
back or under an arm 
thirtyone states have laws requiring use of safety belts but 
ntsb chairman jim burnett said we have a lot of misuse and that 
problem has to be tackled 
overall the safety board said lapshoulder belts provide 
excellent protection with 80 percent of the belted occupants 
suffering minor or no injuries but the study suggested the results 
could have been even better were it not for improper wearing of 
belts 
the ntsb study was not a random sample and therefore does not 
necessarily translate into similar percentages for all motorists 
said lynne smith who was involved in writing of the report but 
she added the data are consistent with previous findings of 
widespread misuse 
the fourmember safety board urged the national highway traffic 
safety administration to require that safety belts meet standards 
for the maximum amount of slack allowed or require that the belt 
systems be equipped with a pretension device that 
automatically pulls a belt tight a split second before a crash 
the safety board questioned the widespread use among us 
carmakers of a belt design that allows a person to pull the belt 
out to its full length without it automatically retracting most 
foreign manufacturers use another design which automatically keeps 
the belt snug against the occupant but which has been criticized 
as being less comfortable and therefore less likely to be used 
the safety board said there is evidence indicating drivers aged 
50 years or older and female occupants are the most likely to 
misuse belts especially wearing them too loosely ms smith said 
that generally slack equal to no more than the width of a fist 
should be allowed in the shoulder belt 
a particularly high misuse of belts was found among children 
onethird had part of the belts behind the back or under an arm 
such misuse seriously degrades the protective capabilities 
of the lapshoulder belt reducing it to a laponly belt with 
inferior crash protection the safety board said 
nhtsa which issues auto safety regulations was reviewing the 
ntsb report said spokeswoman betsy tyson

texans seem to be driven by stronger passions 
than the rest of the nation when it comes to cars and trucks 
according to a new survey they like pickups custom paint jobs 
car telephones and big hood ornaments 
the survey throughout the whole country shows that cars are 
important in other areas but texans really seem to be turned on 
about their cars said rick williams a marketing specialist for 
chevron usa inc which commissioned the survey 
the freewheeling tradition that people like sam houston and 
davy crockett carved out years ago continues to this day 
williams said 
the telephone survey taken in late may questioned more than 
1000 americans roughly half men and half women 
participants were asked to pick the vehicle they wanted from 
several choices given and to rate how well their choice fit their 
lifestyle 
another question listed several areas such as performance fuel 
economy appearance and maintenance asked people to rate how 
important it was 
a third listed several things such as the hood ornament and 
asked how much each appealed 
among texans 50 percent found a luxury car like a cadillac fit 
their lifestyle at least moderately well thats nearly 10 
percentage points more than americans overall 
texans also favored utility vehicles 723 percent vs 506 
percent pickup trucks 712 vs 532 sports cars 40 vs 336 
and basic american sedans 676 vs 637 
on the other hand 396 percent of americans found european 
luxury sedans like a mercedes very wellsuited to their lifestyle 
while 378 percent of texans surveyed agreed 
some 372 percent of texas drivers love their car phones the 
survey found while the devices found favor with 206 percent of 
americans overall custom paint work was favored by 202 percent of 
the texans while only 127 percent of americans found the paint 
mattered a lot 
overall 92 percent of respondents said they liked ornate hood 
ornaments while 145 percent of texans replied in the affirmative 
the margin of error for the overall survey was plus or minus 3 
percent a higher margin of error would apply to subgroups like 
texans

it is too early to say whether higher speed limits on rural 
interstate highways are unsafe but preliminary figures show only a 
1 percentage point difference in traffic fatality rates the 
transportation department reported the department said that during 
the first nine months of 1987 traffic fatalities on highways with 
the 65 mph limit rose 18 percent from a year earlier in the 37 
states that had adopted the higher speed compared with a 17 
percent increase in 11 states that had not 
however the 65 mph speed limit has not been in effect long 
enough to determine its longterm impact on safety said the 
report to congress required by a law allowing states to exempt 
some rural highways from the 55 mph national speed limit 
most of the states raised their speed limits in april and may of 
last year arizona california louisiana and new mexico accounted 
for 70 percent of the fatality increase in states that raised the 
rural speed limit the study said 
from jan 1 1987 to the time of the speed limit change 
fatalities had increased 10 percent from the corresponding period a 
year earlier after the speed limit was raised through sept 30 
1987 fatalities were 23 percent higher than a year earlier the 
study said 
the increase was statistically meaningful but the study 
cautioned against applying it to broad conclusions about the 
longterm effects of the higher speed limit 
while americans debate the pros and cons of a 55mph speed 
limit most west europeans legally drive much faster than that and 
theyve been doing so with a lower fatality rate than the united 
states 
west germans can go as fast as they want on their highway system 
known as the autobahn so long as they obey other traffic rules 
such as the proper use of directional signals when changing lanes 
elsewhere in western europe speed limits range from 866 mph in 
italy to 55 mph in ireland which does not have an extensive 
superhighway system 
the latest statistics of the 12nation european economic 
community for 1986 when a uniform 55mph limit was still in 
effect in the united states indicate a highway fatality rate of 
144 per 100000 population in contrast to 199 in the united 
states that year 
the 1986 highway death toll for eec nations with a total 
population of 320 million was 46046 in the united states with a 
popultion fo 242 million the motor vehicle fatalities numbered 
47900 
this past march however the us department of transportation 
said traffic fatalities in the united states for 1987 were the 
lowest in history as measured by 100 million miles of travel it 
put the rate by that measurement at 24 deaths compared to 25 in 
1986 33 in 1980 and 2408 in 1921 the first year the calculation 
was made 
the department attributed the 1987 decline to the increasing use 
of seat belts and a reduction in drunken driving 
seat belts are required in most west european countries as they 
are in 32 us states and the district of columbia italy plans to 
require seat belts by september 1989 
many european countries also have stiff penalties for drunken 
driving

safety will be among the choices new car buyers will have this 
year according to the national coalition to reduce car crash 
injuries 
air bags and antilock brakes are two of the major safety 
devices that many manufacturers are offering threepoint rear seat 
belts will also be more commonplace this model year the coalition 
points out 
eleven of the worlds 17 largest automobile manufacturers will 
offer inflatable air restraint systems as either standard or 
optional equipment according to a study conducted by ralph nader 
consumer advocate 
four other manufacturers have committed to air bags beginning in 
1990 and general motors which offers them as options on the delta 
88 says it will offer 3 million cars with air bags by 1992 
antilock brakes were offered as standard or optional equipment 
by 17 of 23 auto manufacturers recently surveyed by the insurance 
institute for highway safety 
cary corbin coalition coordinator says most auto manufacturers 
are phasing in standard rear seat shoulder harnesses in the 1989 
model year and by model year 1990 virtually all cars sold in the 
united states will have shoulder belts for the back seat

comparison shopping for an auto insurer can result in 
sharply reduced insurance costs 
while all auto insurance policies may appear similar quite 
the opposite is true says charles f wright assistant vice 
president aetna life amp casualty and a smart consumer can often 
save hundreds of dollars 
some of the moneysaving discounts offered by various companies 
he says include 
a total account credit to those who insure both car and 
home with the same company the credit differs from state to state 
wright says but is usually 10 percent off the auto premium or 5 
percent off both auto and homeowner premiums 
some companies offer a first accident forgiveness which 
after five continous accidentfree years guarantees that rates 
will not go up after a first atfault accident 
car pool commuters often qualify for discounts 
installing antitheft devices in your car may qualify you for 
a discount a 5 percent credit is typical for an alarmonly 
device or an active disabling mechanism which prevents the car from 
starting says wright some companies offer a 10 percent credit 
for a passive disabling device that automatically prevents the car 
from starting 
you can save money by insuring children who drive infrequently 
because they are away at school on the parents policy rather than 
separately 
check the companies that make discounts available to females 
between 30 and 64 years old who are the only drivers in the 
household 
good driver discounts are offered by some companies to drivers 
with accidentandviolation free records and to motorists driving 
fewer than a certain number of miles a year 
some states require discounts be given to drivers who take 
driver training or defensive driving courses 
drivers still at school may be entitled to a good student 
discount program by maintaining a high scholastic average

frustrated by the pokey performance of the stock 
and bond markets lately you wont get much sympathy from fans of 
another staple investment gold 
the price of gold which was hovering in the range of 450 to 
460 per troy ounce heading into the summer made news recently 
when it slipped below 400 for the first time in more than a year 
and a half 
the timing of this weak showing made it especially hard for 
golds admirers to swallow 
first of all it came against a background of widespread 
inflation worries which were given voice by no less an authority 
than alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board gold is 
supposed to thrive on inflation fears 
secondly gold has not benefited from all the shakeup investor 
confidence has suffered through in the nearly 12 months since the 
stock market crash last october gold is supposed to serve as a 
haven from shocks in other investment markets 
a combination of forces has recently ganged up on the price of 
gold observed charles eaton an analyst at nikko securities 
international inc in a recent report on the subject 
among them he cites rising interest rates around the world an 
upswing for the dollar in foreign exchange falling oil prices and 
softness in prices of some other commodities which suggest that 
inflationary pressures are not intensifying the way many people 
thought they would 
gold is international money as defined by the free markets 
eaton said when gold is strong the dollar is weak and when 
gold is weak the dollar is usually strong 
at the same time high real interest rates that is 
nominal interest rates compared to the rate of inflation have 
been a drag on the gold market 
when real interest rates stand at generous levels they offer 
investors an attractive alternative to owning gold which pays no 
interest and in fact may carry a negative yield in the form of 
carrying charges storage fees insurance and other costs 
many wall street analysts have watched the recent drop in gold 
prices with undisguised delight 
after all it suggests that muchballyhooed fears of an 
overheating economy are not warranted and that the federal reserve 
is apparently succeeding in its campaign to keep inflation at bay 
john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc sees a major change 
from the recent consensus holding that an inflationary surge is 
inevitable 
that line of thinking would point to good things for both the 
stock and bond markets 
but there is a darker version of the same picture that the 
weakness in gold may well be forecasting a period of deflation and 
debt liquidation in the months ahead as eaton says 
that possibility rather than an immediate revival of inflation 
now seems to be emerging as the bullish case most often advanced by 
gold advocates these days 
given the size of the worldwide debt problem and the potential 
for a credit contraction we would expect the federal reserve to 
flood the system with liquidity ie loanable funds eaton 
argues 
in such circumstances he says the dollar will naturally be 
cheapened and gold will soar 
that fits with golds image as a kind of financial insurance 
policy like most other insurance policies it is a bet that many 
people even as they make it hope they are not going to win

the biggest action in the stock market these 
days isnt the buying and selling of shares in companies but the 
buying and selling of the companies themselves 
this is takeover fever and rather than diminishing as forecast 
it seems to be intensifying involved in the action are corporate 
raiders corporations seeking new assets leveraged buyout funds 
and big financial institutions 
the reheating of leveraged buyout fever was measured again last 
week when manufacturers hanover corp once a staid old banking 
operation announced formation of a buyout fund that could amount 
to as much as 2 billion 
large as that figure is it belies the true buying power when 
used to buy out shareholders of a target company it can be 
leveraged at a ratio of from 5to1 to even 10to1 or 10 billion 
to 20 billion 
such an amount is sufficient to frighten the management of all 
but the biggest companies in the united states but it is only a 
small part of the pot an estimated 25 billion to 30 billion is 
controlled by buyout specialists 
the activity itself and the potential for more is generating 
concern not just from business and investment people but from 
other interested parties who fear that the longterm soundness of 
the economy is endangered 
high on the list of concerns is that sound companies slowly 
built over many decades are falling into the hands of manipulators 
rather than managers and are prone not only to immediate 
dissection but also to eventual destruction 
enhancing the power and perhaps the danger of leveraged 
buyout money are junk bonds which are highrisk debt 
securities paying high rates of interest a major role of such 
bonds is to substitute longterm debt for equity 
debt does wonderful things for those seeking to buy existing 
companies but it is generally thought to be more dangerous than 
equity to deal with and the critics say those dangers may be 
worsened by other activities of the buyers 
one of these activities is to think short term to sacrifice 
distant strength for immediate financial results and that say 
critics can get any company into trouble such buyers also seek to 
lessen debt by selling off parts of the company perhaps weakening 
it in the process 
the debt itself can become the biggest problem of all 
especially in a downturn costly to begin with it can become 
destructively so in a recession or period of high interest rates 
when even strong companies may teeter 
there is another more positive view of the scene leveraged 
buyouts sometimes get rid of poor management and they provide a 
premium over market prices for shareholders of the company taken 
over 
during 1986 for example 31 percent of all deals were completed 
at a 50 percent or better premium in 1987 38 percent of all deals 
were at prices at least 50 percent higher than those that prevailed 
a month earlier 
such shortterm benefits cannot be denied the question only 
time can answer is whether these immediate benefits provoke distant 
problems 
the transformation of billions of dollars of equuity into debt 
is eroding the financial footing of us industry says wright 
investors service it worries about the economic consequences in a 
downturn 
concern also is expressed by many critics about the market 
volatility and instability that have increased as a result of 
takeover fever with some stocks rising or falling 10 percent in a 
day on takeover speculation 
it was wright says one of the underlying causes of the stock 
market collapse of last october and it also seems to be high on 
the list of reasons why many individual investors have abandoned 
the market perhaps for good

the end of the 1988 model year is producing 
surprisingly strong sales results for the nations biggest 
automakers but raising tough questions for the future 
sales results due out tuesday are expected to show around 155 
million vehicles roughly twothirds cars and the rest light 
trucks were sold during the model year that would be up slightly 
from last year and down from the industry record of 161 million 
vehicles sold in 1986 
up ahead in 1989 and beyond looms a softer market analysts 
said this past week 
high on the minds of analysts and consumers are how much cars 
and trucks will cost and what kind of incentives automakers will 
create in the coming months to lure people into dealerships 
nobody buys cars without incentives said analyst kathleen 
heaney of nikko securities co international inc 
its another way of life sort of like frequentflier 
programs in the airlines said mike kobayashi of painewebber inc 
he added that incentives would be part of marketing all kinds of 
cars and trucks 
analysts agreed consumers are expecting to be offered cash 
incentives and theres a chance that cutrate financing which 
dropped as low as 19 percent just over a year ago may return if 
fears of higher interest rates and modest inflation in 1989 later 
prove true 
but douglas laughlin of bear stearns amp co inc said consumers 
may be offered enticements earlier we could come into the 
calendar year with some kind of incentive he said 
beyond that there is some question about how domestic and 
foreign car makers can convince consumers that their vehicles are 
the best and the most affordable warranties may come into play 
leasing may be more attractive and safety could be a big concern 
estimates of 1989 sales by more than a dozen analysts ranged 
from a high of about 15 million vehicles to a low of about 13 
million 
i think 1989 sales will be flat but a relatively good year 
for the big three said joshuah harari of standard amp poors corp 
for the past several years general motors corp has seen its 
share of the american vehicle market slip as buyers turned to ford 
motor co chrysler corp and the imports the analysts expect to 
see gm arrest that slide in the next model year as among other 
things the worlds largest corporation gives each of its divisions 
more distinctive personalities 
theyve lost the equivalent of a chryslersize company in 
sales in the last three to four years said david healy of 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
gm stopped the hemorrhaging in terms of market share but 
theres still some blood on the bandaid said joseph phillippi 
of shearson lehman hutton inc 
generally the no 1 automaker is aiming chevrolet at the 
economy and modestly priced end of the market pontiac is being 
tagged as the performance car division oldsmobile is getting the 
lions share of gms hightech work and buick and cadillac are 
offering the companys topoftheline cars 
some experts doubt whether ford can continue its phenomenal 
earnings pace of the first half of the year the nations no 2 
automaker has set industry earnings records during the last two 
quarters each well over 1 billion 
they are awash in liquidity said beth fusco of moodys 
investor services 
ford continues to roll on but their quality seems to be 
slipping a little phillippi said ive seen dirt in the paint 
of cars on showroom floors 
healy agreed one of the things i worry about at ford is 
theyve been running full capacity for so long you wonder if 
theyre vulnerable to some quality problems he said 
quality and customer satisfaction are major concerns at 
chrysler where gerald greenwald chairman of the corporations 
carmaking arm chrysler motors corp conceded the company would 
have to struggle to hold on to its 1988 car sales levels in 1989 
big benefits for the no 3 automaker have been its jeeps and 
trendsetting minivans 
god bless minivans and jeeps ben bidwell chrysler motors 
marketing president said late last month during the corporations 
1989 model introduction 
chrysler was the most involved in last years incentive fire 
sales and it lost money in the process but some analysts suggest 
that offering incentives was the only thing chrysler could do at 
the time and since then the companys market share has crept up a 
bit 
they bought market share whose cost is pretty high said 
don descenza of nomura securities inc 
but consumers are mainly concerned about one thing price and 
it appears that prices are going up this coming year generally 
averaging 3 percent to 4 percent above 1988 sticker prices 
however said dick henderson of the pershing division of 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette inci cant see how prices on new 
vehicles are going to be higher than inflation 
its going to be interesting to see how the customer reacts to 
the pricing phillippi said 
beyond 1989 though auto analysts see some dark days 
the big cloud on the horizon is arent we due for a 
recession wondered charles brady of oppenheimer amp co 
its going to be bad in 90 and 91 harari predicted

every six months the magazine polls about 100 international 
commercial banks to rank the creditworthiness of 112 nations on a 
scale of 0 to 100 
its september survey found japan again garnered the most 
confidence with a rating of 948 switzerland was second at 939 
west germany third at 931 and the united states fourth at 897 
at the bottom of the heap were nicaragua with a 52 rating and 
north korea with 45 
the average rating of all 112 nations institutional investor 
said hit an alltime low of 387 
the new global low is the culmination of a longterm downward 
trend in the 10 years that this magazine has been compiling country 
credit ratings it said the decline of two tenths of a point 
since march 1988 seems to reflect an instinctive pessimism 
even a worldweariness rather than any specific developments 
average country credit ratings have been sinking at a 
particularly fast clip since august 1982 when mexicos 
announcement that it could not meet its foreign debt payments 
signaled the beginning of a third world debt crisis that continues

chief executive officers at service companies 
are the highest paid executives in the country according to a 
survey released sunday 
the survey found that the median compensation salary plus 
bonuses for chief executives in 24 service companies was 649000 
from 1986 to 1987 that means half earned more than 649000 and 
half got less 
the conference board a businessfinanced research organization 
listed computer services and software health care and 
entertainmentoriented and real estate firms among the service 
companies in its survey 
the position of diversified services at the top of the 
compensation ladder reflects the significant growth of this 
countrys service economy said charles peck who studies 
compensation for the conference board 
ceos at 254 manufacturing firms ranked second in compensation 
with a median of 642000 and executives in 31 energy and natural 
resource firms were third with a median of 525000 
ranking fourth were 33 retail and wholesale trade company chief 
executives with a median of 413000 fifth were 93 commercial 
bankers at 412000 and sixth were 91 insurance ceos at 398000 
in seventh place at the bottom of the list were 111 utility 
executives whose median salary was 355000 the conference board 
said 
the low compensation standing of utilities clearly reflects 
the heavy degree of regulation in this industry peck said 
compensation in banks and insurance firms has been rising as 
these industries become more deregulated and the scope and 
responsibilities of the top jobs increases he said

olympic athletes arent the only ones going for the gold lately 
preciousmetals dealers say sales of gold coins soared as much 
as 60 percent in the past week after the yellow metals price fell 
below 400 a troy ounce 
the jump in demand hasnt been strong enough to push golds 
price back above 400 a key psychological barrier it cracked on 
sept 21 for the first time in more than 19 months but many 
investors from individuals to managers of large corporate 
portfolios believe gold below 400 represents a buying opportunity 
too good to ignore 
thank goodness considering there was virtually no demand for 
gold coins before gold dipped below 400 said bruce kaplan 
senior vice president of amark precious metals inc a large 
dealer based in santa monica calif 
weve seen a tremendous surge in demand for the us eagle 
the canadian maple leaf and the australian nugget coins he said 
kaplan said amarks sales of gold silver and platinum were up 
40 percent during the seven business days ending thursday compared 
with the previous seven business days most of that business was in 
gold he said 
kaplan said buying activity didnt really take off until gold 
dropped to 395 an ounce on sept 23 prices inched higher for most 
of the past week then fell again on friday 
gold for october delivery on new yorks commodity exchange 
settled friday at 39440 a troy ounce 
gold was valued at around 440 an ounce in early july and at 
about 490 in late december 
james blanchard chairman of new orleansbased preciousmetals 
dealer blanchard amp co reported a 60 percent increase in sales 
during the period sept 2328 compared with the previous four 
business days 
a lot of people who invest in precious metals are people who 
look for bargains and they figure this is the time to go 
blanchard said 
new yorkbased deak international inc reported an estimated 
sales gain of 30 percent to 50 percent in september compared with 
august spokeswoman jerri eskow said most of the orders were from 
new customers many of them firsttime buyers 
golds plunge from around 430 an ounce just one month ago was 
precipitated by government reports that indicated the us 
economys growth had slowed substantially after the brisk expansion 
of the first half 
gold is seen as a investment hedge against inflation which 
typically rises in a rapidly expanding economy the recent signs of 
slower economic growth stifled demand for gold so its price 
dropped 
most analysts expect gold prices to bottom out somewhere between 
360 and 390 an ounce so speculators have been buying on price 
dips 
but analysts recommended caution richard levine vice president 
of the precious metals and foreign exchange group of elders futures 
inc said that at current price levels small investors interested 
in gold should spend no more than 50 percent of what they are 
prepared to commit to gold or gold products 
i would not commit more than 50 percent because i think the 
market is going to have one more major selloff he said 
i think id begin to buy on a scaleddown basis said bette 
raptopoulos preciousmetals analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
realistically speaking its not that clear that its going to 
gallop up again but id begin buying from here on into the 
presidential election she said then i think that toward the 
end of the year youll begin to see a shift toward higher prices 
oneounce coins are the most popular form of gold ownership and 
the us eagle enjoys the greatest favor among buyers in this 
country other coins include the maple leaf the nugget the 
british brittania and the chinese panda 
buying and selling is as easy as picking up a telephone and 
giving the dealer your credit card nubmer many banks and coin 
dealers also sell gold coins 
dealers generally charge a 5 percent or 6 percent premium over 
the spot gold price plus an additional fee of 3 or 4 for 
customers who want to take physical possession of their gold the 
other option is to have the dealer store the gold for you 
a lot of people want something they can touch said diane 
meagher manager of deak internationals chicago office we want 
our customers to feel comfortable with what theyre holding

if a stockbroker friend of yours isnt in 
especially good spirits right now please understand october has 
arrived 
for the average citizen october has a lot going for it the 
world series colorful foliage in much of the country halloween 
but as even the most casual follower of finance knows october 
has been witness to a disproportionate amount of disasters in the 
stock market 
for starters there was the great crash in 1929 backtoback 
selloffs in the late 1970s came to be known as the october 
massacres 
and then of course there was october 1987 when stocks endured 
a collapse that culminated in a record 226 percent drop in the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials on black monday oct 19 
this year the market begins the month still bearing a lot of 
scars from that rout trading volume and morale have both been 
running at low levels lately on wall street 
and with all the attention the first anniversary of black monday 
is certain to get it is almost a foregone conclusion that stocks 
are going to be tough merchandise to move for the next several 
weeks 
just why october should hold so many pitfalls for the market is 
not known statistical studies in the past also have focused on 
may june and september as trouble spots for investors 
to many an observer most calendar tendencies of this type 
are no more than random phenomena lacking any predictive value for 
the future 
some marketwatchers who describe themselves as contrarians 
suggest that the crash memories haunting wall street this month may 
actually produce a chance to buy stocks at bargain prices 
if you want to pick up stocks cheap the old argument goes you 
need to buy them when nobody else wants them 
the market is suffering from buying failure not liquidation 
of stocks contends gene jay seagle an analyst at gruntal amp 
co it is thoroughly liquidated already 
given the current degree of pessimism says the investment 
advisory service market logic the possibility of a buying panic 
that could follow an abrupt easing of the federal reserves current 
tightmoney policy exceeds the likelihood of a replay of last 
falls plunge 
the bargainhunters made their presence felt in the past 
week as the dow jones industrial average climbed 2223 to 
211291 moving within hailing distance of the postcrash high of 
215861 it reached on july 5 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 119 to 15357 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
272 to 38771 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 252 at 30163 
volume on the big board remained sluggish averaging 13494 
million shares a day against 14023 million the week before 
most market optimists views right now are based on the 
assumption that the economy is losing some of the momentum it 
developed in the first half of 1988 but still growing enough to 
steer clear of recession 
one problem with that view say the skeptics is that slower 
growth may mean disappointments in corporate earnings over the next 
several quarters 
the flattening profit trend will be a negative influence on 
equity markets say economists david a levy and s jay levy in 
the current edition of their newsletter industry forecast 
wall street however is deeply concerned with interest rates 
and inflation the growing realization that inflation will not 
become virulent and the consequent expectation that interest rates 
will come down will become positive influences on the stock 
market

a new rule that could phase out municipal bearer 
bonds spells good news for the industry but not necessarily for 
people who have been using them to conceal income from the internal 
revenue service or who like their privacy 
under an industry rule that took effect sept 18 all 
interchangeable securities will be registered in a persons name 
when traded rather than the traditional blank check form under 
the old method 
a bearer bond carries no owners name on the issuers books and 
no name on the certificate since no record of ownership exists 
bearer bonds have been favored by investors wishing to illegally 
avoid gift estate or other taxes 
the holder of a bearer bond can redeem it by taking the bond 
coupon to a bank or brokerage for payment and remain anonymous in 
the process 
the latest rule change was prompted by wall street brokers who 
wanted to cut costs and make processing of the bonds more 
efficient said angela desmond general counsel for the municipal 
securities rulemaking board the industry regulatory group that 
passed the new regulation 
it stemmed from the 1983 tax reform act that banned the issuance 
of new bearer bonds 
since all taxfree municipal bonds sold since 1983 have been 
registered with ownership recorded in computerized form dealers 
reason that it would be easier and more costeffective to deliver 
all bonds in registered form 
in addition registered bonds carry lower risk for all parties 
involved said bill rybak senior vice president of operations with 
van kampen merritt inc 
its easier to track them down if theyre lost or stolen 
rybak said if you misplace a bearer bond the next person who 
has it has a negotiable instrument its like picking up a 5 bill 
on the ground 
indeed bearer bonds figured in a big securities heist in may 
1987 when three men were arrested trying to rob a billiondollar 
shipment of noname bonds outside the depository trust co 
the new rule gives depository trust keeper of most of the 
municipals held in depositories sole discretion to decide whether 
to convert some 75 billion of bearer bonds to registered form 
said barry zucker president of jb hanauer amp co 
depository trust likes the idea of being able to clear out its 
cluttered vaults so the rule is likely to lead to a phasing out of 
bearer bonds 
the change gives people who desire the anonymity of bearer bonds 
little choice except to hold the bonds themselves some analysts 
say 
most bond buyers turn their securities over to their brokers 
who in turn hold them in the depository trust or some other 
depository 
because of the anonymity factor as well as supply and demand 
bearer bonds at one time commanded a premium price analysts said 
but the 1983 reforms changed all that 
were in a registered environment now desmond said if 
people are paying more for bearer bonds that will change soon 
because there really isnt any intrinsic value to holding a bearer 
bond 
however many people prefer keeping their investments 
confidential whether to conceal income from the irs or for other 
reasons so the new rule can be disquieting analysts say 
people feel its a privacy factor a matter of anonymity 
zucker said adding that concealing income is not the main reason 
people are opposed to the rule since banks are required to make 
redemption reports 
bearer bonds account for about one third of the muni market now 
but that is expected to shrink by 1992 when many existing issues 
will pass their 10year call dates

the latest batch of government figures suggest the economy is 
growing modestly and will avoid recession through 1989 but 
investors were more concerned with falling oil prices 
the commerce department said friday its chief forecasting gauge 
of future economic activity rose a moderate 04 percent in august 
indicating to analysts that growth will continue through next year 
but at a slower pace 
the gain in the index of leading economic indicators follows a 
06 percent drop in july and a 15 percent jump in june the index 
is intended to predict economic activity six to nine months in 
advance 
in another report the commerce department said new 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
713000 units in august up 01 percent from july and unchanged 
from june 
it was the best threemonth performance since februaryapril 
1987 when longterm mortgage rates dipped below 9 percent and 
spurred a housing sales boom 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reports were 
good news for the economy and suggest continued economic 
growth 
but those reports were largely bypassed in the financial 
markets where strategists were trading on news that oil prices had 
skidded to nearly 13 a barrel in panicky trading the lowest level 
in more than two years 
the oil decline was caused partly by speculation that saudi 
arabia the worlds largest exporter might flood the world with 
crude and wrench prices down drastically 
reverberations from the oil selloff spilled into the currency 
market where the dollar fell sharply on trader fears that 
declining energy prices would ease inflation pressure and thereby 
depress interest rates in the united states gold also fell on the 
prospect of lower inflation 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of inflation and
