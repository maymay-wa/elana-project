marxist rebels of the western sahara said 
sunday they shot down a us locustspraying plane in the belief it 
was a moroccan military aircraft and they expressed their regrets 
all five american crewmen aboard the plane were killed on 
thursday when a groundtoair missile hit the dc7 and it crashed 
into the western sahara a disputed territory south of morocco a 
second dc7 chartered by the us agency for international 
development also was hit but it managed to land safely about 400 
miles away 
rebel fighters of the polisario front who are fighting morocco 
for independence of the western sahara thought the dc7s were 
moroccan c130 military planes polisario said in a telex from 
algiers to the associated press in new york 
the destruction of one of the two crafts was in no way 
premeditated it was an error caused by a pure coincidence stemming 
from the war conditions existing in the area and the moment that the 
planes arrived the statement said 
polisario said it found the wreckage of the plane and was 
beginning to retrieve the bodies of the victims it said the bodies 
would be returned to their families 
the rebel groups headquarters in algiers earlier denied that its 
units were involved in the attack 
sundays statement called the incident tragic and expressed 
polisarios deepest regrets to the world and deepest sorrow 
to the united states it said the rebels were convinced the incident 
would not hurt their friendly and trusting relations with the 
united states 
in washington state department spokesman rudy boone said there 
would be no immediate comment he said us officials would study 
the statement 
the rebel group said the unit that shot the missiles was carrying 
no equipment that would have enabled it to identify the planes 
it said the plane was attacked about 15 miles from a wall that 
morocco built in the western sahara to keep rebels from penetrating 
farther north into morocco 
it should be noted that the reconnaissance patrols along the 
wall come under daily attack from moroccan aircraft the statement 
said 
it said the planes were flying at the extremely low altitude of 
6000 feet the us embassy in rabat said shortly after the 
accident that the planes were attacked at about 10000 feet 
in rabat morocco a us embassy spokesman said saturday that 
the moroccan government pledged military protection to help a us 
team cross the rebelheld land to find the wreckage in the remote 
region of the sahara desert 
the planes which took off from senegal and were bound for 
morocco were on locustspraying missions none of the five 
crewmembers in the second plane was injured 
the pilot of the second plane joseph francis le gros told a 
news conference in agadir morocco that he saw a missile hit the 
first plane in an engine which caught fire the wing then fell off 
and the plane exploded before touching the ground he said 
officials have said the plane crashed about 35 miles southeast of 
the town of smara in the western sahara the spot lies halfway 
between the mauritanian border and the moroccan defense wall 
the rebels said in their statement sunday that the patrol that 
shot down the plane was also in the smara region of the western 
sahara at the time the moroccan government has maintained the 
planes were shot at from neighboring mauritania 
the us plane was the fifth aircraft shot down over the disputed 
territory since the sahara war broke out in 1975 previous incidents 
involved small french private aircraft 
the polisario movement seeks independence of the former spanish 
sahara territory annexed by morocco in 1976 after spain withdrew 
the united nations is holding talks in an effort to organize an 
independence referendum of the estimated 100000 inhabitants but 
the polisario says morocco should first withdraw 
the fbi in washington launched a criminal investigation friday 
into the missile attack it is looking for possible violations of 
us law such as one that deals with destruction of us aircraft 
overseas

a group of minnesotans offered 11 million 
saturday for their state fair carousel just in time to save the 
74yearold handcarved wooden horses from being separated on the 
auction block officials said 
the offer by our fair carousel inc of st paul was a record sale 
price for a carousel said guernseys auction house spokeswoman 
barbara mintz 
the carousels owners the blinstrup family of eden prairie 
minn set a 1089 million floor price meaning that if bids 
totaled less than that the carousel would not have been sold 
arlan ettinger the president of the auction house said the deal 
that apparently will keep the carousel at the minnesota state fair 
was made just minutes before it was to go on the auction block 
if the groups bid had been turned down and if no one else had 
bought the carousel whole it would have been sold piece by piece 
probably fetching a higher price ettinger said 
the family truly wanted it to stay there ettinger said 
they urged us to consider selling it before the auction which is 
what we did 
obviously were very excited were very happy said brian 
walton a spokesman for our fair carousel we have saved the 
carousel from the auction block but we have a year to save the 
carousel itself 
the nonprofit group formed just last month has a year to raise 
money to pay back the loan it took out to buy the carousel 
the intricately carved carousel created in 1914 by the 
philadelphia toboggan co contains 68 wooden beasts it was ridden 
just 12 days a year at the fair for 74 years said mintz 
the carousels owners mary blinstrup and her two children 
recently decided to sell the ride because they lost money on it in 
recent years and could not make a longterm commitment to keep it at 
the state fair 
the previous record sale price was 678000 paid for the fall 
river mass carousel at a guernseys auction she said 
in addition to the preauction deal involving the minnesota 
carousel about 200 horses and other carousel carvings were put on 
the block and fetched a total of about 5 million saturday ettinger 
said 
theres an increasing awareness of this as a real american art

the fourth man indicted in a cross burning in 
front of a black familys home has pleaded guilty to federal charges 
in the case 
clifford j gilmer 23 of rural st clair county could be 
sentenced to up to 11 years in prison and fined as much as 350000 
for his role in the incident but prosecutors have agreed to seek 
less than the maximum sentence for all the men

a charge of using fire in a conspiracy against the rights of 
citizens 
willie and elsie carter who moved into a house around the corner

the european ariane 4 rocket lifted 
off on its first commercial mission saturday night after a 24hour 
delay and placed two satellites in orbit 
the rocket blasted off at 934 pm 734 pm est from the 
kourou space center on the atlantic coast of french guiana on the 
northern coast of south america 
about 30 minutes later it deployed a satellite to broadcast tv 
directly into european homes and another to be used for british 
military communications according to arianespace president frederic 
dallest 
in a lastminute hitch before liftoff an instrument indicated a 
malfunction of a valve on the third stage of the rocket the 
countdown stopped with 26 seconds left 
but technicians checked the valve and found it in working order 
the countdown resumed after a 30minute delay and the launch went 
on with no apparent problems 
the countdown was halted friday night minutes before liftoff when 
a menacing storm cloud passed it was later postponed because of a 
faulty sensor on the rockets third stage 
the ariane 4 model of the rocket took off just once before in a 
demonstration launch last june when it placed three satellites in 
orbit saturdays launch represents the first commercial mission for 
the latest more powerful and versatile version of the ariane 
rockets 
arianespace is a private frenchbased consortium entrusted with 
commercial launches of the ariane rockets developed by the 
13national european space agency the manufacture and assembly of 
rocket components are divided among dozens of european companies to 
give each country benefits proportional to its investment in 
research and development 
the european program has benefited from the troubles of the us 
space shuttle related to the explosion of the challenger in 1986 
the ariane program now has 40 satellites on its order book for 
future launches 
the astra 1a satellite owned by a luxembourgbased consortium 
is designed to broadcast 16 channels of television programs that can 
be received by home dishes as small as twofeet wide 
eleven of the channels are already sold and plans are to begin 
broadcasts in late january offering allnews allsports

international group is the chief client 
another ariane rocket last month launched a french competitor 
tdf1 but it has not yet lined up programming for its six channels

footloose students at purdy high school broke a 
100yearold tradition saturday night when they held the first dance 
in the schools history in a gymnasium decorated with stars and 
streamers 
the students began filing into the gymnasium about 1015 pm for 
the dance after the purdy basketball team lost to billings high 
school 6156 most of the students were casually dressed wearing 
jeans and sweaters but they seemed excited about being the first 
students to dance in the schools gymnasium 
i expect to have a really good time said sophomore ryan 
deayre who moved to purdy five years ago i thought it was going 
to be a dull town really its not a dull town anymore i just wish 
last years seniors had had a chance to go to this dance 
the dance was limited to the 161 students in grades nine through 
12 because school officials did not want anyone to disrupt it 
journalists were allowed into the decorated gymnasium before the 
dance 
the schools ban on dancing which brought national attention in 
the wake of the hit movie footloose about a similar ban in a 
fictional town was ruled unconstitutional this summer by a federal 
judge 
its great said senior rhonda robberson who was crowned 
homecoming queen saturday night its a wonderful feeling its 
going to be something ill always remember 
the gymnasium at purdy high school was transformed into a tent 
from the arabian nights with stars hanging overhead 
students worked throughout the day stringing blue and white 
streamers and hanging the stars which recalled the theme of the 
evening waiting for a star to fall a popular ballad by the rock 
group boy meets girl starcovered balloons were scattered over the 
gymnasium floor 
the lead plaintiff in the suit jonathan clayton could not 
attend the dance because he is now attending business school in 
kansas city 
he said he was disappointed but its still worth it the idea 
was to allow purdy students to have a dance and we did that 
superintendent sheldon buxton said alumni and other nonstudents 
were kept out of the dance because he feared outsiders bent on 
disruption would be attracted by publicity 
this is our homecoming he said the kids are excited about 
the dance 
us district judge russell clark ruled that the ban promoted the 
values of those who oppose dancing for religious reasons the board 
appealed but a federal appeals court allowed the dance to go on 
while it considers the issue 
although barred from dancing at school purdy students have held 
dances at the community center or in neighboring towns but they 
said that was inconvenient and unfair 
i already live way outside of purdy said junior anna 
svetlecic my freshman year i couldnt go to the homecoming dance 
because it was too far if we have them at school everybody can 
go 
miss svetlecic decided to go to the dance even though her 
boyfriend no longer a student was not allowed to attend she said 
she didnt want to miss history in the making 
miss svetlecic said she had been to only two dances one held at 
the community center her freshman year another staged in kansas 
city as a benefit for the lawsuit that challenged the dance ban 
a lot of people have never even been to a dance she said 
they know how to dance they just never got a chance 
purdy residents say feelings ran high over the dance issue in the 
farming community of about 900 in the ozarks of southern missouri 
supporters of the ban were known to cross the street to avoid 
meeting someone in favor of the dance about 250 people turned out 
at a school board meeting in 1986 most favoring the dance ban 
students circulated petitions and held rallies in support of 
dancing they invited the stars of footloose a movie about a 
fictional town with a dance ban to a rally in 1986 but actors 
kevin bacon and christopher penn did not attend 
three teachers volunteered as chaperones for the dance 
school officials wouldnt even have the parents as 
chaperones said walter welch whose daughter sherry is a 
student at purdy high we would have helped we always do but i 
guess they wanted to do it themselves this time

damaging public and private property 
the clashes between student groups started at the university in 
assiut about 240 miles south of cairo the campus has been a center 
of moslem extremist activity for years 
followers of the two groups have been feuding for months over 
religious differences such as which side should be allowed to 
deliver sermons in the mosques 
both moderates and extremists support implementation of sharia 
the islamic legal and ethical code that was introduced about 14 
centuries ago in the moslem holy book the koran 
extremists advocate using violence if necessary in support of 
the moslem laws while the brotherhood says it is in favor of 
peaceful action the government contends more than 90 percent of 
egyptian laws already conform to the laws of islam

homeowners who apparently were 
alarmed by recent earthquakes in the soviet union and eastern canada 
are clamoring for quake insurance industry officials say 
seismologists say the area has the potential for a damaging quake 
sixty percent of our customers are now asking for it said 
barry forbes regional vice president of wellington insurance co 
forbes said many callers in western canada cited the temblor that 
devastated soviet armenia last week and an earlier one that did less 
damage in quebec 
insurance brokers expect this interest will dry up as the 
impact of the recent quake in the soviet union dies down he said 
even before the recent quakes however concern about a temblor 
strong enough to damage homes had been growing for about three 
years said brian stanhope regional vice president of the insurance 
bureau of canada 
earthquake insurance costs less than 100 canadian for a home 
valued at 100000 said jack adams of adams greer insurance 
seismologist garry rogers of the pacific geoscience center at 
sidney on vancouver island said a quake serious enough to cause 
significant damage about 6 on the richter scale could hit canadas 
west coast at any time 
in fact insurance companies view earthquake damage as the 
greatest disaster potential for that part of canada and fear the 
claims they could face if one occurred stanhope said 
he said he took out quake insurance on his own home last month 
sooner or later we are going to have an earthquake stanhope 
said theres no doubt about that

kenya celebrates 25 years of independence 
monday its famed game parks full of tourists its economy growing 
and towering new buildings rising along the capitals broad 
treelined avenues 
but while the east african nation often is singled out as an 
economic example for the rest of impoverished africa some western 
observers have become increasingly concerned about its human rights 
record under the authoritarian rule of president daniel arap moi 
moi has ruled kenya for 10 years under the slogan of nyayo a 
swahili word meaning footsteps banners and signs praising the 
president and carrying the slogan adorn buildings and roads 
throughout the country 
the footsteps to be followed were originally those of jomo 
kenyatta a leader of the struggle against british rule who became 
the countrys first president in 1964 a year after independence he 
held the post until his death in 1978 
today however the footsteps to be followed are clearly mois 
moi is firmly anticommunist has no apparent affinity for 
africas military rulers and follows generally conservative economic 
policies all of which has won him favor in washington but his 
style of governing is ironfisted and his word is law 
disssent is little tolerated opposition political parties are 
banned by law and the parliament routinely endorses government 
initiatives with little or no debate 
the government owns the countrys only radio and television 
stations and one of the three leading newspapers in nairobi there 
is no official censorship but even independent newspapers dare not 
attack mois policies 
virtually the only internal criticism of the government these 
days comes from some clergymen and attorneys even this is generally 
couched in terms gentle enough not to anger the president 
parliament this year adopted a constitutional amendment that 
gives moi the right to dismiss judges a move some lawyers 
criticized as eroding the courts independence another amendment 
empowering police to hold suspects in capital crimes for up to 14 
days without charge also drew criticism 
about 100 people are serving prison terms after being convicted 
of having links with three clandestine organizations purportedly 
plotting to overthrow mois government many of those convictions 
were based on what critics called tainted confessions 
it is the continuing crackdown against dissidents which began 
about three years ago that has brought the strongest condemnation 
from civil rights groups and individuals outside kenya 
the londonbased amnesty international human rights group has 
accused mois government of subjecting dissidents to torture phony 
trials and disappearances for prolonged periods in unacknowledged 
and unlawful custody 
sen edward f kennedy last month urged the kenyan government to 
pull back from darkness of torture and represession and return to 
the bright sunlight of freedom tolerance and the rule of law 
will kenya go forward with its campaign of intimidation and 
fear asked the democrat from massachusets 
the words were perhaps the harshest criticism of mois policies 
yet voiced in the united states they came at a washington ceremony 
in which the 1988 robert f kennedy human rights award was bestowed 
in absentia on a kenyan lawyer barred from leaving his country 
moi has called amnesty international an agent of imperialists

consistently denied torture allegations and several prison guards

with dissent stifled kenya enjoys a political stability little 
known in many parts of a continent torn by civil wars and tribal 
conflicts and while massive poverty still exists in large parts of 
the country its economy is nevertheless the envy of many of its 
neighbors 
tourists lured by kenyas indian ocean beaches and the 
elephants lions rhinos and other exotic animals that roam its 
national parks pumped nearly 350 million into the economy last 
year that ranked second only to agriculture which not only fed the 
nations burgeoning population but exported nearly half a billion 
dollars worth of coffee tea and other commodities 
but warning flags are flying for the economy 
slightly smaller than the state of texas kenya has a population 
of 22 million that is growing at a rate of 38 percent a year one 
of the highest in the world 
by the turn of the century the population is forecast to be 35 
million possibly outstripping the countrys ability to feed itself 
only 20 percent of kenyas mostly arid land is tillable and that 
portion already is severely overcrowded

despite some sharply conservative campaign 
rhetoric presidentelect bush so far has proposed filling his 
cabinet with moderate republicans known more for their pragmatism 
than their ideology 
political analysts debated during the fall campaign whether the 
vice president was a reagan republican as many of his speeches 
seemed to suggest or was more easily identified with the 
progressive wing of the party once led by the late nelson a 
rockefeller 
as the next cabinet takes shape and the real george bush stands 
up the analysts are suggesting that he falls somewhere between 
reagan and rockefeller more in line with the mainstream 
republicanism practiced by former presidents nixon and ford 
up to now his administration looks like a carbon copy of 
himself he has picked other people who up to a point are white 
middleaged welltodo moderate conservatives comfortable in 
government said stephen hess a political analyst at the 
brookings institution a politically liberal research organization 
he has some of the pragmatism of nixon he basically thinks of 
himself as a problemsolver hess said 
bushs appointments so far are giving some conservatives pause 
other observers are waiting for bush to make good on his pledge to 
appoint new faces including more minorities to his 
administration 
thus far the most conservative member of bushs team may be new 
hampshire gov john sununu whom the vice president has designated 
as his white house chief of staff 
expect more conservative appointments in the days to come sununu 
said in a recent interview 
george bush is trying to reach out to a lot of groups but his 
base is really the conservative base and youre going to see the 
conservative base in there sununu said 
asked about the prospects of more conservatives joining bushs 
cabinet sununu replied that i think therell be a lot more than 
former texas sen john tower if john tower gets appointed as 
defense secretary 
transition sources who spoke only on condition they not be 
identified said discussions are under way with conservative rep 
jack kemp rny for a cabinet post most likely the department of 
housing and urban development although no firm deal had yet been 
struck 
paul weyrich leader of the conservative free congress 
foundation suggested that bushs choices so far have given short 
shrift to the conservatives who played a key part in his election 
last month 
you cant separate a campaign from government they are part of 
a continuum and the coaltion that was put together to elect him is 
the coaltion that needs to be kept together to help him govern 
weyrich said 
the one part of the bush team that is complete is the economic 
unit and none of its members is a rigid adherent of one economic 
theory or another 
they are former new york investment banker nicholas brady as 
treasury secretary texas oilman robert mosbacher as commerce 
secretary lawyer carla hills as trade representative and stanford 
university economist michael boskin as chief economic adviser 
i think he got rid of all the supplysiders said private 
economist michael evans he was referring to the school of economic 
thought embraced by reagan and initially ridiculed by bush that 
contended the budget deficit could be ended by a surge in economic 
growth with deep tax cuts and a big increase in military spending 
i think the people who have been picked based on what theyve 
said in the past are real good levelheaded people i just hope 
they dont go off the deep end trying to please the president 
said evans an early critic of reagans supplyside economics 
analysts of both parties are suggesting that bush has not yet 
named any ideological hardliners of the type that filled the ranks 
of the reagan administration 
other pragmatic gop moderates named so far by bush include his 
longtime friend and former treasury secretary james a baker iii as 
secretary of state and retired air force gen brent scowcroft as 
national security adviser 
brady whom reagan appointed last summer when baker left the 
treasury to become bushs campaign chairman is an old friend of the 
vice presidents 
a wealthy new york investment banker who served briefly as a us 
senator from new jersey brady was chairman of the government 
commission that investigated the october 1987 stock market plunge 
he is viewed as being in the same pragmatic mold as baker so is 
richard darman bushs choice for budget director and a former 
deputy treasury secretary under baker 
attorney general dick thornburgh was opposed by conservative 
republicans at first but most of them ended up supporting 
thornburgh over some of the other contenders under discussion 
education secretary lauro cavazos who fulfills bushs pledge to 
name a hispanic to the cabinet is far more moderate than his 
predecessor william bennett and already has won over some of the 
teacher groups alienated by bennett

the nations local jail population rose 32 
percent in four years the government reported sunday as police 
made more arrests and facilities housed increasing numbers of 
inmates from overcrowded state and federal prisons 
the population of city township and county jails was 296873 on 
june 30 1987 compared to 223551 for the same day four years 
earlier said the bureau of justice statistics the mid1987 level 
was up 8 percent from the previous year when it was 274444 
jails nationwide operated at 98 percent of their capacities in 
1987 compared to 85 percent of capacity in 1983 according to the 
annual survey 
the increases in jail population were fed by larger numbers of 
arrests during the fouryear period and by the transfer of federal 
and state prisoners into jail systems said susan kline of the 
bureaus staff who compiled a report based on the jail data 
arrests of men rose 8 percent from 1983 to 1987 while arrests of 
women rose 17 percent in that time according to information 
compiled by the fbi from police departments around the country 
correspondingly the number of women in jails rose 53 percent in the 
fouryear period to 23920 while the number of men rose 31 percent 
to 295873 
the number of federal and state prisoners being held in local 
jails was 26800 in mid1987 up by more than 3600 in 12 months as 
of mid1987 about 87 percent of large jail systems with at least 
100 inmates were holding inmates for federal or state authorities 
the government surveyed jails administered by city township or 
county officials holding inmates usually for more than 48 hours 
following their arraignment 
the study excluded temporary lockups federal and state prisons 
private correctional facilities and the combined jailandprison 
systems in halfadozen states

carla hills nominated to be the new us trade 
representative may pose conflictofinterest problems for the bush 
administration because her husband is a private trade consultant 
mrs hills former secretary of the department of housing and 
urban development and the only woman tapped by presidentelect bush 
for a senior administration post has promised to do everything 
necessary to avoid any conflicts of interest 
her husband roderick hills is a former chairman of the 
securities and exchange commission and is chairman of the manchester 
group ltd an international trade consulting firm that specializes 
in investment banking 
if a situation presents a conflict he said i just wont do it 
any more 
but hills acknowledged in an interview that his wifes 
prospective new job could put a damper on his business he isnt 
worried though 
ive even run a coal mine once so there are plenty of things 
to do he said 
hills a lawyer said he does very little trade work these 
days although a primary interest is international finance he said 
much of his time is spent helping ailing companies 
if the senate confirms his wifes nomination and she takes her 
cabinetlevel post as trade representative hills said i dont 
see offhand any problem with the trade finance area so far as we 
dont get into anything that requires the discretionary 
activities of the federal government 
the hills were spending part of the weekend with bush transition 
aides reviewing the couples financial dealings hills said they 
might be required to transfer some of their investments into other 
funds 
the situation facing the hills is becoming increasingly common in 
an era when both spouses are employed federal conflictofinterest 
statutes prohibit government employees from taking any action that 
would affect their financial interest or the interest of a spouse 
dependent child or business partner 
david martin former head of the office of government ethics 
said mrs hills will have to be very very careful about her 
husbands business 
as the trade representative mrs hills will negotiate trade 
agreements with foreign countries and formulate administration trade 
policy 
sheila tate a spokeswoman for the bush transition team said the 
staff was confident mrs hills and her husband would satisfy any 
questions about potential conflicts 
conservatives have raised questions about mrs hills ability to 
remain neutral in light of her husbands work 
its shocking to learn that the next head of the key post of 
us trade representative may be someone so vulnerable to potential 
conflictofinterest charges in traderelated matters said 
anthony harrigan president of the us business and industrial 
council a group of conservative business leaders 
until august hills was registered as a foreign agent for c 
itoh a japanese company he monitored legislative and regulatory 
activities for them according to forms filed with the justice 
department 
hills also has been a consultant to manchester associates a 
group that has had dealings with the trade representative on behalf 
of clients such as nissan motor co and the korean traders 
association in 1986 hills did work for korean air lines 
mrs hills a lawyer in the washington office of the new 
yorkbased law firm of weil gotshal and manges also has worked for 
foreign companies according to a jan 19 1987 article in legal 
times she represented crown forest industries ltd and british 
columbia forest products in a lumber trade fight between the united 
states and canada the report said 
mrs hills did not return a telephone call to discuss what she 
did for the firms 
mrs hills nomination is expected to be approved by the senate 
finance committee despite the opposition of some conservatives who 
regard her as too liberal 
paul weyrich a conservative organizer said he told bush at a 
meeting friday that i cant rally the conservative movement for 
carla hills 
mrs hills politics have been an issue since 1973 when she was 
nominated as assistant attorney general according to a document 
released friday by the national archives at the time she was a 
lawyer in los angeles and president reagan was governor of 
california 
governor reagan has cleared her for this position but has not 
endorsed her the white house memo said she is considered a 
liberal by reagans standards mrs hills subsequently went to 
the justice department where she received high marks for her 
performance 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
predicted mrs hills would be confirmed by the senate but he 
questioned her knowledge of trade issues 
i had hoped frankly that wed have someone from the business 
world who had extensive international experience in trade bentsen

the nations public school teachers say they 
are not getting enough support from parents and most report 
problems such as child abuse poor health and bad nutrition among 
the children in their classrooms according to a survey released 
sunday 
ernest l boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said the survey of 22000 teachers found a 
sense of frustration in the classroom both at the lack of support 
they receive from parents and from a feeling of powerlessness in 
teaching 
large majorities of teachers find poverty poor health 
undernourishment and neglect to be problems at their schools said 
boyer in his foreword to the report the condition of teaching 
teachers from every state were canvassed in twin surveys 
conducted by mail in the spring and fall of 1987 
among the findings 
90 percent said lack of parental support was a problem at their 
schools 
89 percent said there were abused or neglected children at their 
schools 
69 percent said poor health was a problem for their students 
68 percent said some children were undernourished 
teachers repeatedly made the point that in the push for better 
schools they cannot do the job alone and yet there is a growing 
trend to expect schools to do what families communities and 
churches have been unable to accomplish said boyer 
teachers in the survey described their students as emotionally 
needy and starved for attention and affection boyer said 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association said the reports disturbing statistics underscores 
the need for parental involvement 
i wish i could sit down with every parent in america and 
emphasize how important they are to their childrens education 
ms futrell said in a statement parents are a childs first and 
potentially the most influential teachers 
the nea president said even the best teachers cannot go it 
alone teachers need allies and the allies they need most are 
parents 
the average public school teacher earned 28031 in 198788 
according to figures from the nea 
fortynine percent of the teachers in the carnegie survey said 
their pay was worse than they expected 41 percent said it was about 
what they expected and 10 percent said it was better the average 
teacher surveyed had 16 years experience 
the average teacher faced 79 students on a typical day with 
elementary teachers working with 60 different pupils and secondary 
teachers 114 
the typical class size was 23 sixtytwo percent of the teachers 
said their most typical class was about the right size 36 percent 
felt it was too large and 1 percent said it was too small the 
figures do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding 
most teachers said the school reform movement had led to greater 
state regulation of local schools fiftynine percent said the 
reform movement has increased political interference in education 
37 percent said it had not changed the amount of interference and 4 
percent said it decreased interference 
only 7 percent of the teachers surveyed said they planned to quit 
the profession as soon as they could fiftysix percent planned to 
teach until they retire 21 percent said they probably would 
continue teaching 10 percent were undecided about their career 
plans and 6 percent said they may take time off from teaching 
the carnegie foundation based in princeton nj published 
earlier condition of teaching reports in 1983 and 1985 it said 
the overall margin of error on the unusually large survey was only 
plus or minus 1 percent

the chairman of the house agriculture committee 
says hearings are planned next year into how the us forest service 
handled last summers stubborn wildfires that scorched the west 
including onethird of yellowstone national park 
the major problem is that in speaking to people from the area 
you speak to two and you get three opinions says rep kika de la 
garza a texas democrat the best thing to do is to sit down and 
have them all put it on the record and then sift through what 
happened and see if anything needs to be done 
de la garza said the hearings would focus on forest fire 
practices and can a catastrophe of that nature be avoided or was 
it a catastrophe 
i was in montana and i visited with some people and i have some 
concern over some of the practices of the forest service de la 
garza said in an interview last week 
the hearings will focus on fire fighting policies rehabilitation 
of charred areas and on scientific research being done on the summer 
fires said a subcommittee staff member 
de la garza says the committee also plans dozens of hearings 
nationwide in preparation for the 1990 farm bill and will look at 
the us department of agricultures response to this years 
droughtrelief legislation 
the committee will consider a uniform pesticide labeling law and 
legislation to protect ground water from agricultural pesticides and 
fertilizers de la garza said 
de la garza said he hopes the house interior committee which has 
jurisdiction over the national park service and the agriculture 
subcommittee on forests with jurisdiction over the us forest 
service will hold joint hearings on last summers wildfires the 
worst in a century 
the us forest service said 5 million acres were charred in the 
raging blazes including 706000 acres in yellowstone 
the forest and national park service spent a combined 300 
million fighting the summer fires the forest service said the most 
severe were in and around yellowstone and alaska although there 
were fires in the south california and the pacific northwest 
drought conditions high winds and a tremendous buildup of 
tinder in yellowstone in particular helped make the 1988 fires the 
worst in a hundred years officials said

some residents of woolsey population 186 
more or less have just discovered they have a mayor and a city 
council and they dont like them one bit 
suddenly civicminded residents have also learned that election 
notices are posted on an old coke machine in a car repair garage 
theres a city charter too tucked in a drawer in a city 
councilmans home 
the charter provides for elections every september but there 
havent been any in some time because no one has run against the 
incumbents albert berg sr says he lost the mayors job 12 years 
ago to lawrence zeller but zeller said he thinks he has been mayor 
now for only five or six years 
the government meets at the fire station to discuss city business 
when something comes up according to zeller 
we got a peaceful little town here councilman james carden 
said were not trying to hide anything the people that are 
complaining have been here five months a year if that long he 
told the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution 
people from nearby atlanta have been moving into the area 
bringing along citified ideas of how government should operate 
but the newcomers arent the only ones looking surprised says 
cynthia carpenter who has lived on the towns main street for seven 
years until a few months ago we didnt know who the mayor was 
which was probably negligence on our part 
the town government started becoming an issue when construction 
began on a convenience store on the towns main street 
neighbors were outraged they got madder when they discovered 
carden had sold the land apparently zoned residential to a 
developer and then they claim he voted with the rest of the 
government to rezone the land commercial 
some people want an injunction to halt construction and a recall 
move is afoot 
i want it stopped said earline lockhart who moved to town 
five months ago even if the same men are reelected i want them 
to know that they arent going to govern without the rest of us 
being informed 
the mayor insists the land was rezoned in 1964 but residents 
found a letter from the council to fayette county building 
officials dated dec 8 1987 that says the council has approved 
the zoning of land lot 203 to be commercial the residents take 
that to mean the rezoning was done at about that time 
there are no signs announcing council meeting times 
the only sign announcing the september elections is posted on the 
1961 coke machine in cardens car repair shop every august 
thats the only place its been posted the people in woolsey 
that do not know when its time for an election have not talked to 
people in woolsey or those on the council zeller said 
since 1984 the state has required towns to post election 
results woolsey has not sent the state any results since then 
woolseys fire police water and building inspectors are 
provided by fayette county woolseys officials are not paid and 
there is no city budget city taxes or business license fees 
homeowners complained about the zoning flap to the fayette county 
commission last week but the commissioners said there was nothing 
they could do 
the commissioners invited zeller and the councilmen but they 
declined to attend zeller said they didnt want to answer questions 
from the floor 
its a very hostile thing answering questions from the 
floor the mayor said

museums are less secretive about thefts now 
as they hope publicity will help recover stolen items and theyre 
paying more attention to security because one theft could mean a 
loss worth millions officials say 
although the annual number of thefts may not be increasing the 
value of the items stolen is according to constance lowenthal 
executive director of the new yorkbased international foundation 
for art research 
security is something that museums have to think about more and 
more she said 
the foundation promotes the recovery of stolen items through a 
directory published 10 times a year of items that have been taken 
the publication is distributed internationally to art dealers 
museums collectors and insurance companies 
only 12 percent of the art objects stolen are recovered she said 
in just the past month four items have been taken from two 
philadelphia museums and an edouard manet painting valued at more 
than 1 million was taken from the heckscher museum in huntington 
ny but later recovered 
museums once shied away from publicizing thefts for fear of 
scaring off wouldbe donors now they are beginning to see that 
publicity can help recover items making them too hot to handle 
lowenthal said 
she pointed to the heckscher robbery in which the remorseful 
thief called police and told them where the painting could be 
recovered 
the foundation directory will publish descriptions of the items 
taken from the two philadelphie institutions the university museum 
and the rodin museum 
during the early morning of nov 11 the university museum lost 
the worlds secondlargest crystal ball a clear quartz sphere 10 
inches in diameter and weighing 55 pounds and a 2000yearold 
egyptian statuette of osiris the god of the underworld the quartz 
orb carved in the late 19th century for the empress dowager of 
china is valued at up to 300000 and the statuette is worth up to 
45000 
a week later the museum discovered the theft of a sri lankan 
mask from a handson exhibit for the blind which has since been 
closed said museum spokeswoman molly stockdale 
new security measures were installed and armed campus officers 
now patrol the museum at night she said 
lowenthal said a very disturbing trend also has been for more 
violent robberies 
on nov 23 an armed man took a 12inch bronze head from the 
rodin museum after handcuffing the unarmed guards the piece mask 
of the man with the broken nose is valued at more than 75000 
leon j perelman 77 operated the perelman toy museum in 
philadelphia until a robbery in august in which a caretaker was 
bound and held at gunpoint by two men the only items taken in the 
robbery were marbles 
i think in my own particular case i had very valuable items 
that were worth 10 times the items stolen he said whoever was 
behind this was a collector of marbles this was the kind of 
thing the robbers were getting for somebody 
perelman closed the museum after the robbery and has sold the 
remaining pieces 
he said unscrupulous art collectors may hire someone to take 
selected pieces which then are hidden for the collectors private 
enjoyment 
there are individual collectors who are so obsessed with the 
fact they have to own certain things perelman said 
despite the increase in prices for art a painting by pablo 
picasso recently sold in london for 385 million profit isnt 
considered by many to be what prompts thefts 
its very difficult to market an item once its been 
stolen said ed able executive director of the american museum 
association in washington 
after an item is reported stolen the publicity usually prevents 
the robber from selling it openly and receiving a large sum of money

the outgoing health and human services 
secretary says the bush administration will have to walk a very 
tight line to avoid cutting the quality of health care in trying 
to curb soaring medicare expenses 
dr otis r bowen said that with a federal budget out of balance 
medicare cannot escape close scrutiny simply because it is one of 
the nations largest budget items and one of the fastest growing 
particularly the 15 percent annual inflation rate in physician 
payments 
at the same time we have to walk a very tight line and make 
sure we are not reducing the quality of care and access to care 
he said in an interview last week it is my judgment that were 
getting close to that level now and we have to be very cautious 
about going too deep 
bowen declined to discuss specifics of the final budget the 
reagan administration will submit next month 
however department officials have acknowledged previously that 
they have agreed to about 6 billion in net reductions in projected 
medicare outlays mostly by holding down payments to doctors and 
hospitals 
no reductions are proposed in benefits for the 32 million elderly 
and disabled americans served by medicare nor does the budget 
envision increased charges to beneficiaries 
looking beyond the restraints he has agreed to for the next 
budget bowen said we are getting close to the time where further 
ratcheting down could cause some deterioration in the quality of 
care and perhaps even access to care 
the next secretary and the next administration are going to 
have some difficult battles with the health care providers and also 
maybe even with the senior citizens who are being impacted by it 
he said 
one of the reasons its going to be tougher is because of the 
massive new numbers of old people that we have coming along said 
bowen who will be 71 in february 
he cited statistics projecting that the number of people over 100 
years of age will grow from 25000 to 100000 in just over a decade 
not only will they require more medical attention because of such 
an advanced age bowen said those living longer will have used up 
their savings and might become a bigger burden on public 
assistance 
bowen a former twoterm governor of indiana who long ago 
expressed his desire to return to his home state for a quiet 
retirement said in a wideranging interview that his greatest sense 
of accomplishment was passage of the catastrophic protection 
addition to medicare that takes effect in january 
getting the presidents approval over the objections of so many 
in the cabinet that was the tough part said bowen once the 
president gave his approval then it became a lot easier to try to 
contain the number of additions congress wanted to add to it 
his greatest disappointment he said was that the states have 
moved too slowly to address medical malpractice insurance problems 
that bowen said could be threatening access to health care in some 
regions 
he said he is not certain the bush administration should propose 
federal legislation to supplant the states traditional control of 
insurance during its first year but i think its certainly time 
to begin talking about it and decide what the parameters of such 
legislation should be 
on aids he said there still needs to be special emphasis on the 
epidemic by federal health officers because of the emotional 
response of the people people are scared to death 
i hesitate to single it out as a disease to be treated 
differently from others but i think as yet it does need to have a 
little extra special treatment he said 
bowen said he has not been consulted by bush transition officials 
for a recommendation on who should succeed him but he said he hopes 
the incoming president will not view the appointment as a minor one 
when youre talking about a kinder and gentler america youre 
talking about hhs he said of the huge agency that has a larger 
budget than the pentagon and embraces such programs as social 
security medicare and welfare 
the department also includes the sprawling public health service 
umbrella that covers such wellknown agencies as the food and drug 
administration the national institutes of health and the centers 
for disease control

nude angels coaxing lonely men to donate 
money to the church of love and promising a retirement paradise 
called chondaza are the heart of a sensational fraud case being 
tried in federal court 
prosecutors say the church was the front for a mailorder 
sexfantasy scam that exchanged pictures of nude women and phony 
letters for contributions to a nonexistent church paradise 
the government says 31000 men in nearly every state were bilked 
out of 45 million in the alleged scheme based in moline 
the case revolves around a former english teacher donald s 
lowry 59 who founded the church of love in 1965 and his 
assistant pamala st charles 25 
both face multiple charges of mail fraud conspiracy and unlawful 
use of fraud proceeds if convicted of fraud lowry could face 130 
years in prison and fines of 65 million ms st charles faces a 
possible sentence of 65 years in prison and 25 million in fines 
former church members have testified for both sides 
raymond wisman 76 of montpelier ohio said he believed lowrys 
stories and planned to retire to chondaza and live with the angels 
i was lonesome and i had figured that this was real instead of 
phony wisman said 
carl cornell 83 of de queen ark said he learned the angels 
were fiction a year after joining the church in 1981 
as long as ive lived ive been like a fish who bit the hook 
and got caught cornell said i didnt care if they were real 
the letters were entertaining theyre nice letters and they make a 
man feel good 
lowry testifying last week compared himself to santa claus 
fulfilling mens dreams 
assistant us attorney k tate chambers describes lowry as the 
mastermind who created the paradise idea wrote all the letters from 
the love angels to church members solicited models he passed 
off as angels to pose nude for photographs members paid for and 
then lined his pockets with the contributions 
this isnt a case about dirty pictures sex or obscenity 
chambers said its about fraud 
at issue is the elaborate myth lowry says he spun to provide a 
healthy fantasy for his church members he says it was an innocent 
fantasy which church members participated in willingly and knew was 
not real 
it was a very pure wholesome and decent fantasy testified 
lowry of bettendorf iowa this is based on the principle that 
the illusion of romance is better than no romance at all 
the phony letters from love angels boosted the confidence of 
the lonely men who responded with their own letters and 
contributions lowry said 
the government says the contributions were used to pay lowry and 
his wife esther salaries exceeding 100000 a year for four years 
and that the church corporation also bought a fleet of expensive 
cars 
lowry admitted in court last week he paid 100 to 150 for sexual 
favors from the women who modeled as love angels he said he even 
gave one woman clothing a car and furniture and paid her rent but 
contended that was not related to sexual acts 
the church of love folded in 1987 and lowry organized a new 
group called the international order of knights consisting mainly 
of former church members 
lowry even put 5000 down earlier this year on 84 acres near new 
philadelphia ohio where he planned to build a retreat for his 
knights 
the trial was to resume monday with testimony from ms st 
charles

south florida residents willing to pay extra for a 
feeling of security have taken crime and traffic problems into their 
own hands blocking off public streets with barricades and posting 
guardhouses 
a guardhouse is going up in the andover area in dade county 
barricades are in place in suburban miami shores roving patrols 
operate in the hammock oaks subdivision and a dozen road barriers 
have been placed in fort lauderdales riverside section residents 
often voluntarily raise taxes for such measures 
the barricades a response to muggings purse snatchings and 
breakins have been adopted primarily by older welltodo 
neighborhoods bordered by less affluent areas or commercial strips 
the disturbing fact of this i suppose in the worstcase 
scenario theres the medieval idea of a walled city said william 
tilson an associate professor of architecture who specializes in 
urban design at the university of florida its kind of ironic in 
a society that seems to be so concerned about information and 
networks that were often myopic in other actions 
street barriers have been adopted by communities across the 
nation as buffers against crime in st louis for example and to 
encourage bicycle and pedestrian traffic such as those in davis 
calif 
barricades are a response to a crime condition thats gotten 
out of hand tilson said theyre seen as perhaps the most 
economical or the most expedient ways of dealing with a problem that 
presents itself immediately 
the prestigious palm hibiscus and star islands in biscayne bay 
have opted for guardhouses where the license plate numbers of 
visitors are copied down 
miami shores blocked 18 intersections with barrels and stop signs 
in june and has seen a 17 percent reduction in crime for the village 
as a whole and 20 percent in the barricaded zones said mayor spero 
canton 
the village of 9600 people north of downtown miami ranges from 
lower middleclass homes to affluent country club homes and bayside 
villas 
we live about a halfmile from some pretty tough areas of dade 
county so it seems that when these crack addicts or drug users look 
for money they look to a neighborhood with money canton said 
attorney peter kircher a miami shores resident on a committee 
opposed to barricades considers them ludicrous and the expense 
utter stupidity 
it started out as a partial solution to a problem and then it 
became a solution to everything he said increasing property 
values decreasing traffic crime name the problem we will solve 
it with barricades 
kircher has urged his village council to remove the barricades 
but council members have refused saying residents have a right to 
block off their streets to discourage criminals from cruising their 
neighborhoods 
in unincorported dade county five special taxing districts have 
been formed and four applications are pending from residents willing 
to pay extra property taxes for street closings guard gates and 
extra patrols 
the andover area where streets are lined by royal palms and 
property values range from 125000 to 300000 will open its 
guardhouse jan 1 about 475 residents will pay 380 each next year 
and 150175 a year afterward for their new district 
were not foolish enough to believe its going to be a panacea 
of all our ills said don grate a retired schoolteacher and 
president of the andover civic association we think the value of 
property will go up knowing you have more security people like to 
feel they have some semblance of security 
fort lauderdale mayor robert cox said the perception of safety 
is almost as important as the safety itself 
what do you have when youve barricaded off all the good 
areas asked hubert williams president of the washingtonbased 
police foundation think tank if the sense of community is 
predicated on class discrimination that kind of thing would be 
diametrically opposed to our highest democratic principles 
he also mentioned concern for the right to use public 
thoroughfares 
william wilbanks a criminal justice professor at miamis florida 
international university said that such security measure will 
displace crime in areas that are not too well protected that will 
probably mean poorer communities

nine members of the german jewish councils 
executive board resigned sunday in the wake of an embezzlement 
scandal earlier this year involving funds for holocaust victims 
said the leader of the council 
heinz galinski said the nine resigned because they no longer 
enjoyed the confidence of their colleagues and local jewish 
councils 
he said the resignations were linked to the discovery earlier 
this year of irregularities in funds earmarked to assist victims of 
nazi persecution 
the councils former president the late werner nachmann was 
suspected of illegally channeling nearly 172 million in interest 
from the funds to prop up his financially struggling businesses over 
a sevenyear period 
members of the executive board who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the nine had been blamed for not properly overseeing 
nachmanns handling of the councils financial affairs 
galinski said the council is continuing to investigate the 
affair which he said remains a heavy weight on all of us

students in this centuryold community gave the 
first dance ever allowed in their public schools the highest mark of 
teenage approval awesome 
but the weekend success was no guarantee of future school dances 
in the ozarks town of 900 where a federal judge had to step in to 
open the way for saturdays homecoming gala 
student council president nancy fox appearing tired but happy 
after a day that included a college entrance exam and the historic 
dance said early sunday that she wasnt ready to plan another dance 
im still thinking about cleanup for this one she said 
students were shy about taking the floor when the dance began but 
miss fox said she reminded them of the attention the dance 
controversy had received around the country 
they say we cant dance miss fox told her schoolmates 
after that the floor was crowded for the rest of the evening 
she said 
sheldon buxton superintendent of the purdy school system said 
about 85 students attended the dance he said it went smoothly but 
refused to comment on whether other dances could be expected 
longtime residents say purdy has never been without a ban on 
social dancing in the schools but us district judge russell clark 
ruled this summer that the school boards written policy against 
dancing unconstitutionally promoted the values of those who oppose 
dancing for religious reasons 
the fourmember school board appealed clarks order that they 
stop enforcing the ban but a federal appeals court allowed the 
dance to go on while it considers the issue the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals is not expected to rule in the case before next 
year 
school board members have been saying all around town that they 
students might have this one but they wont have another one 
said joan fox who has been a spokeswoman for the 21 purdy students 
and parents who sued the school board over the dance ban mrs fox 
is nancy foxs mother 
school board members refused to comment on the case 
nancy fox said board members attended the dance which was barred 
to all but the 161 students currently attending purdy high school 
but the board members who sat on the sidelines during the dance 
talking among themselves apparently did not cramp students style 
it was a blast we had a great time miss fox said 
it was really fun everybodys dancing said shannon 
francisco a purdy senior who left the dance ahead of the main crowd 
but miss francisco 17 added that the dance had caused 
controversy and bitterness in the small town 
i dont think it was worth all that she said 
crowds of students leaving the dance which began about 1015 
pm saturday and ended at midnight answered with choruses of 
awesome when asked about their evening 
reporters and photographers were not allowed into the small 
gymnasium during the dance but loud rock music shouts and claps 
could be heard throughout the dance 
students most dressed casually in jeans and sweaters went to 
the dance in the elementary school gymnasium immediately after 
watching their varsity basketball team lose a 6156 game to billings 
high school in the larger high school gymnasium purdys elementary 
and high schools are within the same complex

authorities imposed tight security in the tibetan 
capital and searched foreigners hotel rooms sunday a day after 
police fired on independence activists in a central square western 
travelers said 
china said sunday that a buddhist monk was killed and 13 people 
were wounded when police fired into a crowd during the demonstration 
in lhasa western travelers said they believed two people were 
killed and another foreign traveler said a tibetan reported seeing 
four bodies at a hospital 
it was not immediately possible to reconcile the casualty figures 
the clash on saturday was the third bloody confrontation in the 
remote region between authorities and antichinese protesters since 
october 1987 
tourists said chinese police were looking for foreigners caught 
in the protest near the jokhang temple one of the holiest sites of 
tibetan buddhism 
a dutch woman wounded in the left shoulder reported complete 
panic after the shooting began 
everybody started running i heard the bullets skimming past my 
head shoo shoo said christa meindersma of amsterdam in a 
telephone interview from her hotel room in lhasa 
i felt a sting in my arm but i didnt realize it was a 
bullet said ms meindersma the soldiers were running after us 
i ran into a tibetan courtyard and i said im wounded and i 
fainted 
ms meindersma who said she had been in lhasa since september 
studying tibetan said she refused to stay in a hospital where she 
was treated because police wanted to question her and take her 
picture she said police also searched her hotel room 
she said police searched the rooms of other foreign tourists 
a large group of tibetans prayed on sunday near scattered pools 
of blood left from saturdays clash in the citys central 
markeplace said a frenchman reached by telephone in lhasa 
they placed candles and little white tissues on the blood in 
the same way they do for the buddhas in their temples said the 
26yearold frenchman who identified himself only as thierry 
he said there was no new violence by midday sunday when about 
1000 police drove through the city and others patrolled the market 
on foot he said soldiers with guns also stood guard from rooftops 
overlooking the market 
a traveler speaking on condition of anonymity said by telephone 
from lhasa that a tibetan who went to the hospital to give blood for 
the wounded saw four bodies 
on sunday activists were distributing leaflets in tibetan and 
english calling for an end to chinese rule over tibet the frenchman 
said 
two witnesses to saturdays events said buddhist monks told them 
there would be another demonstration sunday but later efforts to 
reach the remote region by phone and telex were unsuccessful 
the clash saturday began when 30 tibetans identified by the 
xinhua news agency as monks and nuns marched into the market 
carrying the banned tibetan flag to commemorate the 40th anniversary 
of the un declaration on human rights the protesters dressed in 
street clothes and face masks demanded an end to 38 years of 
chinese communist rule over the himalayan region 
the nationally televised evening news said police were forced 
to fire during saturdays unrest when some troublemakers refused 
to heed a warning and threw stones and bottles at police 
the official xinhua news agency said that of the 13 injured two 
were seriously hurt it gave no details and did not say if they were 
demonstrators 
another dutch woman who witnessed the clash lucia dezries said 
a crowd of tibetans surged toward the demonstrators and began 
stoning the security forces who opened fire she said it was not 
clear whether the stonethrowing or shooting began first 
ms dezries said she saw two people lying in pools of blood and 
was told they were dead 
the chinese government claims tibet has been part of china since 
the 13th century many tibetans however say they were independent 
during most of that time and were ruled by a buddhist theocracy 
headed by the dalai lama who had both civil and religious authority 
chinese communist troops moved into tibet in 1950 and put down an 
uprising nine years later during which the dalai lama fled to india

president mikhail s gorbachev standing in the 
rubble in the earthquakeruined city of spitak told rescue workers 
sunday they must race to bury the dead before an epidemic strikes 
and takes more lives 
in 20 minutes of remarks shown to the nation on the television 
evening news gorbachev also promised armenians an investigation 
into why new buildings collapsed in wednesdays quake while older 
structures remained standing 
he said that once the rescue and cleanup are completed a 
government commission will look into that question 
why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those 
built with three or five stories under former soviet premier nikita 
s khrushchev are still standing he said in an angry tone 
soviet buildings are notoriously poorly constructed but the 
public admission of this by a top soviet official is rare 
in an emotional exchange a man in the crowd that surrounded 
gorbachev on a spitak street demanded to know why scientists did not 
predicted the earthquake which has killed at least 40000 people 
according to official estimates 
we also are making such demands the soviet leader told the 
man but he added so far nowhere in the world do they have 
methods to predict earthquakes 
he said health minister yevgeny i chazov had advised him that 
the weather conditions in the disaster area would create a threat of 
an epidemic seven days after the earthquake bodies buried under the 
rubble must be removed to avoid an outbreak he said 
gorbachev told the rescuers that doctors and health officials 
have devised emergency measures in case an epidemic strikes he did 
not elaborate 
the kremlin chief did not specify what kind of epidemic might 
break out but destruction of urban water supplies and pollution 
from decaying corpses can spread deadly diseases such as typhoid and 
dysentery 
later on the broadcast gorbachev spoke in the armenian capital 
of yerevan with a soviet television correspondent who asked about 
the dispute between armenians and azerbaijanis over the 
nagornokarabakh district of azerbaijan armenians have been 
pressing for the annexation of the region most of whose people are 
ethnic armenians 
gorbachev raising his hands for emphasis and speaking in an 
angry tone accused provocateurs pushing for control of 
nagornokarabakh of using the tragic consequences of the earthquake 
to create instability 
he said some activists accused authorities of planning to take 
children orphaned in the earthquake out of armenia gorbachev 
angrily denied this was planned and said what kind of morals do 
those people have 
they dont need karabakh they are waging a battle for power 
and they must be stopped he said 
gorbachev and the rest of the leadership have rejected the 
annexation demand the dispute between armenians and azerbaijanis 
over the issue has led to violence that has killed about 60 people 
in the interview gorbachev praised the outpouring of assistance 
from throughout the soviet union for earthquake victims 
we are proud of all our people he said what immense moral 
strength they have 
the priority in the rescue now he said is to save people still 
trapped under the piles of crumbled concrete 
first and foremost we must help to clear these piles of rubble 
where there are still many people alive because people are being 
freed there every day i have met some of them so the first task 
the first thing being done is to save those who are still alive 
those who have perished must also be got out as befits human 
beings given a funeral gorbachev said

wilmington college is beginning the 
second year of an offbeat student recruiting campaign that features 
a small arctic animal called a lemming 
the college reports the campaign is highly successful either 
despite or because of its use of humor in a matter young people take 
very seriously 
college spokesman ray wojda noted that the traditional student 
recruiting features five nerdy kids standing in front of a 
stately old campus building 
by contrast the small quakerrelated schools campaign features 
a cartoon rodent who carries a lemming state pennant wears official 
lemming state sneakers perfect for following the crowd and 
jumping to conclusions the ad says and has eyes that are 
bloodshot from straining to see the blackboard from the back of a 
lecture auditorium 
lemmings which look like gophers have a destructive herd 
instinct that causes them occasionally to migrate toward the sea 
where they often drown 
the wilmington campaign promises the college is for those who 
would rather be an active participant in your education than a 
bystander 
results of the campaign have far exceeded our expectations 
wojda said enrollment rose to a capacity 825 from 759 last fall 
applications increased 15 percent and entering students scores on 
the american college test were the highest in 12 years wojda said 
the ads which were designed by the cincinnati advertising firm 
of sullivan amp findsen were so successful that wilmington is trying 
the humorous approach again in its annual fundraising campaign 
featuring a parody newspaper

ptl founder jim bakker railed against the 
news media but urged followers of his new covenant church to forgive 
his accusers sunday in his first public remarks since being indicted 
on fraud and conspiracy charges 
if the news media wasnt the biggest moneymaker today would 
they still pay people 1 million to lie and tell stories he said 
during a 20minute message to about 400 followers the love of 
money is the root of all evil 
they ask us why dont you attack your enemies bakker 
said his voice rising the devil wants me to renounce my 
salvation and attack attack attack the bible says love your 
enemies 
im not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies im not 
going to lift a finger to vindicate me bakker said that will 
put cold chills down your enemys spine 
bakker also talked about his reaction to being fingerprinted and 
having his mugshot taken at the federal courthouse in charlotte 
i looked up at all those wanted posters and i thought no one 
is smiling so i smiled bakker said if im going to be on 
the walls of post offices im going to smile 
bakker did not allow reporters inside the converted skating rink 
where his new covenant church holds sunday services however some 
of his remarks could be heard through the door 
bakker has declined interviews since his indictment last monday 
on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy he and three of his former 
associates were indicted after a 16month federal grand jury 
investigation of the ptl television ministry 
bakker 48 and richard dortch 57 his former top deputy at ptl 
were accused of diverting more than 4 million of their followers 
money to support their own lavish and extravagant lifestyles 
they and the others are expected to appear thursday before us 
magistrate paul taylor 
bakker resigned from ptl in march 1987 after admitting money was 
paid to buy the silence of a woman with whom he had sex 
meanwhile ptl which filed for reorganization under federal 
bankruptcy law in june 1987 goes on the auction block with its 
heritage usa theme park monday at the order of a bankruptcy judge 
analysts say its unlikely creditors will get more than a 
fraction of the 130 million theyre owed 
it will be the second time in a month that courtappointed 
trustee mc red benton will try to auction the 2200acre 
property which includes a 500room hotel a water park a 
television studio and a 2000seat church 
the only certain bidder toronto businessman stephen mernick has 
let it be known he intends to offer a total of less than 70 million 
cash a month ago he said he would pay 115 million 50 million of 
it cash 
if the top bid doesnt satisfy us bankruptcy judge rufus 
reynolds the judge might shut down ptl and sell it piece by piece 
as bakker and his wife tammy faye entered the building sunday 
he briefly talked about reports that more than 30 television 
ministries were under investigation by the internal revenue service 
they fear evangelism he said 
bakker in introducing a fellow preacher at the service made an 
apparent reference to former associate john wesley fletcher who was 
quoted by penthouse magazine as saying he had a homosexual 
relationship with bakker 
ive learned people i gave 100000 to werent my friends he 
said its wonderful to know you have friends im talking about 
people who stick with you through thick and thin

people on standby patrols are out looking for brush fires 
a brush fire that did an estimated 43 million damage in the 
fashionable hillside suburb of porter ranch friday morning was 
finally put out saturday millan said firefighters combed the 
burnedover area for hot spots sunday he said 
fourteen houses and a mobile home were leveled 25 other houses 
were damaged and 3200 acres of brush was charred but there were no 
injuries 
residents described fleeing through a rain of fire as wind 
estimated at 60 mph or more drove flames and embers into their 
neighborhood of 300000plus homes on the edge of the san fernando 
valley suburbs 
investigators trying to determine the cause of the fire sought 
two men seen in a park near the point of origin before dawn friday 
millan said the men were being sought as witnesses not suspects 
millan said 
the santa ana winds as they are known here pick up speed as 
they funnel through canyons in the mountains around southern 
california heat by compression dry the brush further and can 
spread the smallest fire into an inferno 
the winds which sweep southern california sporadically every 
fall and winter were blamed for the disastrous spread of two other 
los angeles area fires last week 
a total of 22 homes in la verne and baldwin park both to the 
east of downtown were destroyed thursday in la verne a brush fire 
spread into a bedroom community in baldwin park a blaze at a paper 
recycling plant raged through a neighborhood of modest houses

from the declaration of a national day of mourning 
to nationwide calls for relief the soviet government is using the 
disastrous earthquake in armenia to unify this country of disparate 
peoples languages and cultures 
for nearly 50 years world war ii has served that purpose and 
the government propaganda machine still pours out stories 
documentaries and films recalling the great patriotic war in which 
20 million soviets died and the soviet union suffered and triumphed 
as a nation 
the space program too is portrayed as a national endeavor 
today the rallying cry is the earthquake which has killed about 
50000 people by official estimate the government has moved with 
extraordinary speed to mobilize its vast media resources to inform 
and to draw its people together 
official reports say the disaster has united armenians and 
azerbaijanis whose ancient ethnic feud was rekindled recently when 
a territorial dispute resulted in violence in several cities 
leaving about 60 people dead in the months before the earthquake 
interethnic cooperation in disaster relief may subdue the strife 
but some armenian activists already have complained that authorities 
are shipping children orphaned by the quake out of the republic to 
be cared for 
they have charged this would constitute russification a 
derogatory term for the russian majoritys blurring of ethnic lines 
on sunday president mikhail s gorbachev angrily denied that 
orphans were being sent out of armenia and said the activists were 
trying to create instability 
the soviet union is a huge country bound more by central rule 
than common purpose its people spread over a sixth of the earths 
land represent more than 100 nationalities speak dozens of 
languages and in some cases feel more kinship with people from other 
countries than with their own 
unlike in the united states where a nation of immigrants prides 
itself on having formed a great if imperfect melting pot 
centuriesold ethnic groups in the soviet union are struggling to 
maintain their separate identities 
the nations 15 republics are held together by kremlin power and 
a national armed force but a citizen is more likely to refer to his 
or her nationality than call himself or herself a soviet 
gorbachev who returned abruptly from the united states to rush 
to the stricken region has made the earthquake a national cause 
his personal leadership in a time of crisis has contributed to a 
sense of unity 
the staterun media which once ignored natural disasters have 
poured out information telling and showing people throughout the 
country the extent of the damage and the need newspapers and 
television have been just as quick to report the response 
the official tass news agency has noted for instance that 
russia the ukraine and kazakhstan sent cranes to help raise the 
rubble that a planeload of medical supplies was dispatched from a 
factory in western siberia and that tents and food were dispatched 
from tadzhikistan 
there have been similar reports in the media daily 
the country long isolated by suspicion and fear of foreigners 
also has opened its borders to accept aid it once would have been 
too proud or perhaps too selfconscious to accept from outsiders 
not only has assistance come from moscows socialist allies but 
from great and tiny nations around the world the united states 
denmark algeria iran are among those mentioned in a single report 
even assistance from nations such as israel with whom the soviet 
union has no diplomatic relations and intense political disputes 
has been welcomed 
gorbachev who describes himself as a realist has been pragmatic 
enough to break down barriers that his predecessors hid behind 
today the preservation of any kind of closed societies is 
hardly possible he told the united nations the day the quake 
struck the world economy is becoming a single organism and no 
state whatever its social system or economic status can develop 
normally outside it

solidarity leader lech walesa visited the 
headquarters of four french national unions sunday but snubbed the 
largest labor federation the communistled general confederation of 
labor 
walesa making his first foreign visit in seven years thanked 
the four unions for their support and urged east and west europe to 
come together in peace 
something is moving in poland something is moving in eastern 
europe walesa said our europe should rejoin yours we want to 
rejoin peacefully intelligently but with respect for the identity 
and culture of each party 
the powerful general confederation of labor currently leading a 
strike that has snarled public transit in paris for weeks backed 
the 1981 martiallaw crackdown on solidarity by polish leader 
wojciech jaruzelski over the years it has usually followed 
moscows lead on international policy 
walesa made a round of visits to the smaller french democratic 
confederation of labor the french confederation of christian labor 
the workers force and the general confederation of cadres thanking 
them for their support over the years 
although union membership figures in france are unreliable 
independent experts estimate about onefourth of union members in 
the country belong to the communist confederation including many 
noncommunists 
walesa made only one public reference to the communistled 
confederation saying its secretarygeneral henri krasucki had not 
contacted him when visiting poland he joked that he might have lost 
his address while cleaning out his pockets in anticipation of being 
searched by polish authorities perhaps i would also lose the 
address in a similar situation walesa added 
krasucki said saturday he found the polish union leaders 
threeday itinerary very significant and said walesa was meeting 
only leaders of unions who are refusing to take action and signing 
accords on the backs of french workers which destroy the social 
achievements of a halfcentury 
the other four unions recently signed an agreement with the paris 
transit authority that the confederation denounced as a sellout of 
workers interests 
walesa was in paris at the invitation of president francois 
mitterrand for saturdays celebrations marking the 40th anniversary 
of the un declaration of human rights he and soviet human rights 
activist andrei sakharov met for the first time saturday the two 
men are both nobel peace prize winners walesa in 1983 and sakharov 
in 1975 
bronislaw geremek a top solidarity aide and walesas personal 
adviser said both men agreed the soviet union and poland must make 
more progress on human rights before walesa would be willing to 
participate in a proposed human rights conference in moscow 
geremek said the first signs of hope for dialogue with polish 
authorities came only recently when walesa appeared on 
governmentcontrolled television for a threehour debate media 
exposure which he has long been denied 
maybe we can finish this year with progress geremek said 
walesa has started each day at a mass sung in polish at the 
polish roman catholic communitys 17th century domed church off the 
place de la concorde 
on sunday he met cardinal jeanmarie lustiger the polishborn 
roman catholic archbishop of paris who described walesa as living 
proof that freedom is the most precious of all the qualities in 
the world because nothing can bind a man who is free to think love 
and forgive 
sakharov and his wife yelena bonner spent a quiet and private 
sunday shopping and lunching at an italian restaurant 
neither sakharov nor walesa have conducted highprofile visits 
nor have they publicly criticized the polish or soviet governments 
they have limited brief statements to general human rights issues 
and appeals for help for earthquake victims in armenia

rescuers in this earthquakeravaged 
city struggled sunday with poor equipment and organization to free a 
dwindling number of trapped survivors after saving at least 1500 
adding to the tragedy of this stricken city a soviet military 
transport plane carrying soldiers to help in rescue efforts crashed 
as it approached a city airport killing 78 people tass said 
president mikhail s gorbachev wound up a twoday visit to the 
disaster area and called wednesdays earthquake in armenia a grave 
disaster simply a tragedy 
it is simply difficult to bear this in human terms it is 
unbearable gorbachev told soviet television 
he exhorted rescuers to speed their efforts warning an epidemic 
of disease could break out within a few days 
gorbachev and his wife raisa were shown consoling survivors and 
speaking with rescuers in spitak a city of 16000 that was 
virtually destroyed by the quake and in kirovakan 10 miles to the 
east 
he said 3900 soldiers from the region who are performing 
military service throughout the country were being granted leave to 
return home 
the estimated death toll increased doctors without borders an 
international relief organization said in amsterdam that health 
minister yevgeny i chazov told workers the quake had claimed 
5000060000 lives the previous government estimate was 
4000045000 an estimate the the soviet embassy in washington was 
still using sunday 
the embassy also said about 500000 were left homeless and 6000 
people were hospitalized it said 1500 people have been rescued so 
far 
soviet officials including gorbachev denied charges sunday that 
children orphaned by the quake were being sent from armenia to other 
parts of the soviet union 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said on 
the british tvam program that 22 people were arrested in yerevan on 
saturday when about 600 protested over the orphan issue 
he denied the children were being shipped away but he added 
suppose we had too many armenian children to be adopted in 
armenia why should you object to russians or people of any other 
nationality helping here 
the earthquake has aggravated an already severe refugee problem 
in the southern republic of armenia where thousands of ethnic 
armenians fled because of antiarmenian rioting in neighboring 
azerbaijan 
the kremlin has rebuffed efforts by armenian nationalists to 
annex an armeniandominated region of azerbaijan and a dissident 
source told a london newspaper that soviet authorities saturday 
arrested about half of the 11 leaders of a nationalist group 
in his television comments sunday gorbachev accused supporters 
of annexation of trying to take advantage of instability created by 
the earthquake to push for control of the armenian enclave 
they are waging a battle for power and they must be stopped 
he said 
he also promised armenians an investigation into why new 
buildings collapsed in the quake while older structures generally 
remained standing 
many survivors took shelter in tents on sunday when temperatures 
were in the low 40s 
in leninakan armenias secondlargest city near the turkish 
border stacks of red black or unfinished wood coffins were piled 
on street corners 
mayor emil kirokofyan told the first group of foreign 
correspondents to visit the area after wednesdays quake that 
recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand 
such a severe temblor even though leninakan is located in an area 
of frequent earthquakes 
choking back tears the mayor told reporters he lost 15 relatives 
hundreds of bonfires fueled by cardboard trash or debris 
provided the only heat for people who had spent the last four nights 
on the streets and sent a pall of smoke over the city of 250000 
people 
i dont have anywhere to live i am homeless cried an old 
woman walking out of rescue headquarters where officials had put 
her on a list for new housing 
everywhere officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and 
heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off 
trapped people 
at one site rescuers worked feverishly with saws torches 
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the 
top of what was a ninestory apartment building 
survivors who spoke about the tragedy described a series of three 
or four quakes separated by brief pauses 
there was a hum and then everything started to shake to the 
left and to the right it was like a ship said anna asatyan who 
sat at a bonfire in the street in front of her home 
a un disaster relief agency official said the local rescue 
effort was poorly organized and that it might be too late to catch 
up 
relief from abroad continued to flow in 
a belgian relief team of experts carrying 40 tons of equipment 
including fourwheeldrive vehicles left for yerevan on sunday as 
did an israeli plane with a 42person team headed by an army general 
although the soviet union does not officially recognize israel 
the israelis offered to help soon after the quake two more planes 
are scheduled to take off monday 
one dutch medical relief crew was refused visas soviet diplomats 
claimed no more foreign relief was needed according to a red cross 
spokesman said in amsterdam on condition of anonymity 
foreign relief workers said they ran into snags upon reaching the 
disaster areas 
the relief effort until you reach the spot here has been very 
good said sverre kilde a norwegian un officer but here on 
the spot there is no control 
kilde said a french rescue team estimated survivors could hold 
out only for another three to four days and that any new equipment 
sent from abroad probably would not arrive in time 
mayor kirokofyan told reporters the newer apartment buildings had 
been constructed to withstand a shock of 7 to 8 on the 12point 
soviet scale of damage but he said the quake registered 10 in 
leninakan and the buildings crumbled

a high soviet official will meet soon 
with pakistanbased afghan rebels for more peace talks and moscow 
has proposed direct talks with the guerrillas iranbased allies 
rebel leaders said 
a spokesman for the rebels in pakistan burhannudin rabbani said 
their meeting with soviet deputy foreign minister yuri vorontsov 
would take place in the next two weeks rabbani spoke in a telephone 
interview from riyadh saudi arabia 
a pakistan government official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity confirmed the meeting would take place in islamabad he 
did not say when 
rabbani denied news reports that the rebels would accept an 
international peace conference proposed by the soviet and afghan 
governments we reject this conference it is between us and the 
russians he said 
the sevenparty guerrilla alliance supported by the united 
states and pakistan negotiated with the soviets from dec 3 to 5 in 
taif saudi arabia the private meeting was the first between the 
soviets and representatives of the anticommunist rebels since 
soviet troops marched into afghanistan in 1979 
the soviet union has also offered to hold direct talks with 
leaders of the afghan resistance based in iran the official islamic 
republic news agency of iran reported sunday 
the agency monitored in nicosia cyprus quoted a spokesman for 
the iranbased fundamentalist rebel alliance as saying after 10 
years of occupation the soviets were finally forced to accept that 
the afghan people and the mujahedeen rebels have a major role and 
have agreed to talks 
the spokesman said that the iranbased alliance was studying the 
soviet offer and had not yet made a decision whether to accept the 
television broadcast said 
most of the fighting against the soviet troops in afghanistan has 
been conducted by the pakistanbased rebels but the iranbased 
rebels have conducted separate operations 
the news agency said a delegation from the pakistanbased 
alliance was due in tehran for consultations but it did not say 
when 
during his recent trip to new york soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev called for an international peace conference on 
afghanistan and a ceasefire 
the soviet union which has withdrawn half its 100000 troops 
under a un accord recently suspended the withdrawal after 
complaining that pakistan and the united states were still arming 
the rebels who have continued fighting 
there is no room for a ceasefire said rabbani the 
russians must move from afghanistan 
he said vorontsov assured the afghan resistance leaders that the 
soviets were ready to go from afghanistan 
the rebels repeatedly have called for the removal of afghan 
president najib and the disbanding of his marxist peoples 
democratic party 
at the talks in saudi arabia vorontsov reportedly refused to 
make any commitments about najibs future but rabbani said the 
soviet official did not close the doors to possible changes in the 
kabul government 
he said everything can be discussed said rabbani 
the resistance leader said the most significant outcome of the 
direct talks was moscows tacit recognition of the moslem insurgents 
before the russians did not recognize the rebels said 
rabbani whose jamiateislami rebel group largely controls the 
strategic salang highway leading from the afghan capital to the 
soviet union

little children have come in and given us their christmas 
donations said hazel barsamian who is working with the armenian 
relief societys chicago chapter 
this little girl came with her grandfather and she apparently 
had a piggy bank that she was saving for christmas she said 
grandpa instead of me getting something why dont i give this 
for the earthquake victims ms barsamian said 
in new york city the rev yeznig balian and others noted that 
the very fact that the soviet union agreed to accept help from the 
outside including the united states was one encouraging outgrowth 
of the tragedy 
if there is any silver lining to a tragedy like this it would 
be the openness of the system right now balian said 
while many kept busy gathering donations of money and supplies 
others had more personal concerns 
for gerry nazarian in new york the quest for information was 
sadly fruitful he spoke to relatives in california who called 
family in moscow who reached relatives in yerevan who got hold of 
family members in leninakan one of the hardesthit cities 
the last word we had last night was that two of our cousins 
are dead nazarian said they were in an office and the entire 
office building collapsed its terrible terrible i couldnt 
sleep all night i mean the whole family is so upset 
its that pain you just cant describe it 
armenians have a way of surviving we have a history of this 
kind of tragedy said ms barsamian in chicago we are fighters 
we are survivors we stand together and we will survive and we will 
help

prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of the 
rightwing likud bloc renewed talks sunday with the rival labor 
party in hopes of forming a national unity government by weeks end 
israel radio said 
shamir and foreign minister shimon peres leader of leftleaning 
labor agreed each party would set up a threemember negotiating 
team to hammer out the coalition agreement the radio said 
in elections last month likud won 40 seats and labor won 39 but 
likud was able to forge a tentative coalition with small orthodox 
and extreme rightwing parties giving it control over more than 
half of the 120member parliament and the upper hand in coalition 
talks 
we should not stretch out these negotiations said moshe 
shahal a member of labors negotiating team it should take two 
or three days 
a likud spokesman told the radio the new government would be 
similar to the joint government formed after the 1984 elections 
ended in a stalemate peres was prime minister for two years and 
handed power to shamir in 1986 
but it is unlikely that likud will agree this time to share the 
prime ministry with labor 
for the last four years the policy of the coalition government 
has been paralyzed by disagreements on the future of the occupied 
territories and peace negotiations 
likud and labor still are split over the proposal to hold an 
international middle east conference which peres favors and over 
the establishment of new jewish settlements in the occupied areas 
likud and its allies want new settlements 
likud has offered labor the foreign ministry on condition that 
labor pursue no new diplomatic initiatives without likuds approval 
the demand was seen as a way of stifling peres call for the 
international peace conference

police said sunday they believe a man 
whose body was left in a wooden box on a riverbank three years ago 
was a tenant of the woman who ran a boardinghouse where seven bodies 
have been unearthed 
authorities said the latest body linked to dorothea montalvo 
puente was dumped on the sacramento rivers east bank in adjacent 
sutter county more than two years before the bodies were buried in 
the yard of puentes downtown boardinghouse those seven bodies were 
discovered last month 
puente 59 has been charged with one count of murder in the 
boardinghouse case and additional counts are expected to be filed 
in january coroners officials have said the boardinghouse victims 
all died in 1988 police believe they were tenants killed by puente 
for their social security checks 
on saturday police arrested ismael carrasco florez 46 a 
sacramento handyman authorities accused of building the coffinlike 
box for puente and helping her truck it to the river in late 1985 
florez was booked in sacramento county jail on suspicion of being 
an accessory to murder he was released later the same day on 3000 
bail 
florez has been identified as the subject who built the wooden 
box in which a victim was placed and then transported to sutter 
county by he and dorothea puente police capt michael okane said 
the name of the victim was withheld until his identity could be 
confirmed he was described as a 55yearold white man with a 
mustache and false teeth okane said earlier reports that the 
victim was a woman were incorrect 
asked if police believe puente might be linked to any deaths 
beyond the eight okane said thats a possibility but we have 
to deal with how many people we can trace to her and where they 
are 
he said investigators are still trying to locate two former 
tenants of the boardinghouse which catered largely to poor people 
and alcoholics there may be a couple we may never find he 
said that doesnt mean they have been are slain it could mean 
they just disappeared 
the body found in sutter county was discovered by a fisherman on 
new years day 1986 about two miles south of verona and about 20 
miles north of sacramento okane said the man had been dead two to 
four weeks when his body was discovered in wellmade 6foot plywood 
coffin 
okane said sutter county authorities contacted police about a 
possible link between the body and puente because it had been 
wrapped in plastic like many of the bodies unearthed in the yard of 
her rooming house 
police traced florez through the registration of a pickup truck 
he once owned okane said florez did a variety of carpentry jobs 
for puente at the boardinghouse but hasnt been linked to any of the 
other deaths 
the handyman told police that he didnt know what was in the box 
the sacramento bee reported sunday police spoke to him at his home 
friday and took him saturday to the river bank where the body was 
found

archbishop desmond tutu on 
sunday challenged the government to charge him with treason saying 
he is as guilty as four black activists sentenced to prison last 
week 
also sunday a human rights group released the text of an open 
letter to president pw botha from blacks detained without charge 
at johannesburg prison demanding that they be tried or freed 
in an article in the sunday star newspaper tutu protested the 
sentences imposed thursday at the end of a threeyear treason trial 
four activists including three senior leaders of the united 
democratic front received prison terms ranging from six to 12 years 
for treason 
tutu leader of the anglican church in southern africa was a 
sponsor of the united democratic front when the nationwide 
antiapartheid coalition was formed in 1983 and has supported it 
steadfastly since then 
the group was banned in february and the judge in the treason 
trial declared it a revolutionary organization which sought the 
violent overthrow of the government 
if these four men have committed treason then i have committed 
treason and should face charges as well tutu wrote he urged that 
the four be granted bail during an appeal process 
whatever happens i will campaign as i have never campaigned 
before until they are released he said whether or not the law 
was properly applied the effect of this judgment will be to 
discourage people from peaceful opposition 
convicted were patrick lekota a spokesman for the front its 
national secretary popo molefe and moses chikane the transvaal 
province branch secretary 
the fourth activist convicted of treason along with front 
leaders was tom manthata a south african council of churches field 
worker manthata was dispatched by tutu in 1984 to monitor the 
township rioting which prompted the treason charges 
the johannesburg detainees in a letter released by south 
africas recently established human rights commission said they 
would observe a oneday fast monday to protest the 30monthold 
state of emergency 
emergency regulations allow indefinite detention without charge 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained for varying periods 
during the emergency and about 1000 are believed held at present 
in their letter to botha the detainees said we have in our 
midst people who have been kept more than 24 months in detention 
we have children whose lives are being wasted here and who may not 
recuperate from the effects of detention some held with us have 
been tortured 
if you are convinced that we committed some sort of crime you 
have the courts of law to try us the letter said it is against 
this background that we categorically demand our immediate release 
the human rights commission in an accompanying statement said 
there were about 180 detainees at johannesburg prison it described 
them as prisoners of war in a country that is in a state of civil 
war with its own citizens 
in a separate development the main association of afrikaner 
business executives said a factfinding team sent to western europe 
had concluded that tougher sanctions against south africa were 
inevitable unless major political changes took place 
the team said europes attitude would soften only if south africa 
adopted a political system acceptable to a majority of blacks who 
at present have no vote in national affairs gradual reforms such as 
those advocated by the government would not be sufficient to avert 
tougher embargos the group said 
south africas mainly dutchdescended afrikaners make up about 60 
percent of the white population of 5 million and dominate the 
governing national party

heidi holland knows about art and artists 
especially littleknown female painters of the last several hundred 
years she can talk at length about their work and how they were 
ignored or denigrated by other painters the public or both in 
these respects shes a knowledgable woman 
what heidi doesnt know about is life particularly the problem 
of sorting out what kind of person she would like to be if she ever 
becomes an adult thats a lot harder to deal with she says 
but the woman makes an attempt to find out about herself in the 
heidi chronicles wendy wassersteins perceptive and very funny 
new play about what its like growing up female in the 1960s 70s 
and 80s 
the play which opened sunday at offbroadways playwrights 
horizons traces one womans confusion from the tentative 
beginnings of the womans movement in the 1960s to the postfeminism 
of today when traditional values that favorite buzz word of 
current politicians have reasserted themselves with a vengeance 
in between heidi takes a candidelike journey that carries her 
through various stages of social sexual and political awareness 
she travels pretty much as an outsider looking in on the problems 
and foibles of her friends and lovers but unlike candide she 
questions everything and everybody she comes across 
the people she meets and they keep popping up with some 
regularity include scoop rosenbaum a cocky journalist who starts 
out working for something called the liberation earth news in the 
late 1960s and ends up as the owner of boomer a big magazine 
success of 20 years later the two start out as lovers and end up as 
friends 
her other constant male friend is a caustic young man who becomes 
the most successful pediatrician in manhattan he also happens to be 
gay a fact he reveals to heidi during a demonstration at the art 
institute of chicago against its sexist exhibition policies 
heidi also watches the evolution of her best friend susan who 
goes from clerking for a supreme court justice to tending sheep on a 
womans collective in montana to producing a successful television 
series that certainly is some resume but not an unlikely 
combination for miss wasserstein to concoct the playwright who 
also wrote the equally hilarious isnt it romantic is a witty 
social commentator with a deadly accuracy for skewering the trendy 
conventions of our time 
despite its many laughs the play has serious intentions too 
the evening culminates dramatically in an impassionated speech by 
heidi to her high school alumnae society in it the woman explains 
that she is still unhappy despite some success in life 
i thought the whole point was that we wouldnt feel stranded 
heidi proclaims i thought the point was we were all in this 
together 
the play ends on a surprising note perhaps too surprising for 
what has gone before but its a hopeful note too suggesting that 
miss wasserstein has not lost her belief that things really have 
gotten better for women 
joan allen portrays heidi as an intellectual idealist trying to 
rationalize her way into doing the right thing her indecision is 
fascinating to watch its an incisive performance 
peter friedman is oily but charming as the aggressive scoop he 
keeps the mans obnoxiousness at bay as he climbs the ladder of 
yuppie success boyd gaines gay doctor masks a compassion behind an 
acidtongued exterior and his conflict adds an undertone of 
darkness to what could be just a comic part among the other members 
of the large cast joanne camp makes a strong impression in several 
roles particularly a strident feminist and a tough but shallow 
television talk show host 
director daniel sullivan has marshaled the plays many scenes as 
if they were revue sketches the pace is as fast as the quick 
movement of thomas lynchs mobile settings that glide and fly across 
the tiny stage the costumes by jennifer von mayrhauser accurately 
mirror the nearly 25year span the play covers 
the heidi chronicles is a modernday feminist odyssey told 
with wit style and a great deal of compassion

if christmas always seems to bring out 
that feeling of oh what fun it isnt to pick out the tree take 
heart things are looking up 
cultivating christmas trees once a disorganized endeavor is 
fast becoming a sophisticated industry and there are more and better 
trees to choose from 
the business of christmas trees has become a mature type of 
enterprise said david baumann associate director of the 
33yearold national christmas tree association in milwaukee 
people are getting very knowledgeable on what they need to grow 
market and care for trees 
anyone who has gone to the local lot and agonized over what 
always seems like the most important decision of the holiday season 
knows that hasnt always been the case 
in the 1950s nearly 90 percent of the trees sold in the united 
states came from natural stands where people went in the woods and 
cut them down what you saw was what you got consequently most 
markets suffered shortages and most of what did arrive on the lot 
was of inferior quality 
twenty years ago they were cutting a lot of trees out of the 
wild said hal schudel who operates holiday tree farms in 
corvallis ore with his three sons and oftentimes they were cut 
way back in early october those trees then laid around and they 
might be pretty good but theyd dry out 
the big breakthrough for farmers was the realization that to 
control quality and improve harvesting techniques they had to 
operate on a plantation basis the ncta estimates that 90 percent of 
the trees sold now are grown on plantations 
we gradually saw the light says schudel who has been in the 
business for over 30 years and sells between 400000 and 500000 
trees a year from his farm on the fringe of the cascade mountains 
we decided to plant trees in rows to see if we could grow them 
that way as a farmer would his corn we were able to control weeds 
better and spray our crop to protect it from the weeds and brush 
and we were able to grow more trees per acre and manage it as a 
crop 
shortages which aided the dramatic rise in popularity of the 
artificial tree no longer are a problem not even the severe 
drought that hampered farmers throughout the summer has put a dent 
in this years harvest the ncta expects a record 341 million trees 
will be cut for the holidays an increase of 800000 over last year 
the growers in this country have come a long way in producing a 
good quality product said schudel who brings much of his harvest 
down from the mountains by helicopter to ensure its freshness 
theres plenty of trees of good quality available now if 
distribution is good theres no need to settle for anything but a 
good tree 
today farmers have set their sights on growing the ultimate tree 
the whole effort is toward the perfect tree baumann said 
people dont want a charlie brown christmas tree 
for the most part the consumer isnt getting that anymore using 
the latest horticultural technology trees are nurtured fertilized 
and pruned for the eight to 15 years it takes them to grow from 
eight to 10inch seedlings into full symmetrical trees six to 
seven feet tall 
some still do it the oldfashioned way 
we used to pick our own seeds from about 40 bushels of cones 
said florence belle whos worked in the business for more than 40 
years and has a stand of 1000 saplings on her property near saranac 
lake in the adirondack mountains then wed put them on racks and 
dry them out 
growers in michigan which along with oregon produces upward of 6 
million trees the most in the nation have begun tagging many of 
their trees in an effort to demonstrate that their product is a 
notch above the competition and farmers in illinois indiana 
oregon washington california and new york are following suit 
growers want trees grown in their state to be known in the same 
way that idaho potatoes or florida oranges are known baumann said 
according to figures compiled by the ncta demand for real trees 
has grown an average of 22 percent a year over the past decade in 
a recent study conducted by pennsylvania state university 39 
percent of the households surveyed used real trees and 35 percent 
had artificial ones while 26 percent did not have a tree 
the ncta is helping out with a milliondollar television ad 
campaign its first ever the spots which started airing right 
after thanksgiving feature weatherman willard scott urging watchers 
to have a real tree merry christmas 
growers maintain a real tree is still a bargain too 
we can measure retail prices baumann said and what weve 
discovered is that over the last 20 years theyve gone up about half 
the rate of the consumer price index 
the association said 1988 retail prices should range from 300 
to 525 a foot varying with the quality of the tree and local 
market conditions

in just six years si spiegel and larry 
squarci have soared to the top of one of the christmas seasons most 
profitable industries the artificial tree 
hudson valley tree inc located in this city 60 miles north of 
new york city is one of the nations largest manufacturers of 
artificial christmas trees 
in the six years since the company first opened with a mere four 
employees hudson valley tree has grown into a 25 million business 
employing 800 workers yearround with factories in newburgh and 
indiana 
the softspoken spiegel says he never dreamed of such success 
when he started in 1982 
i expected a good business but i didnt think it would be this 
good he said during a recent interview in his office located t 
one end of the newburgh plant 
we originally thought wed take the higher end of the market 
and sell locally to department stores and nurseries he said 
but sales are many times higher than originally anticipated and 
more than half of the companys merchandise is sold outside new york 
state to department store chains across the country including 
hawaii puerto rico and alaska 
spiegel attributes his companys success to emphasis on customer 
service and acceptance of the product 
when i first began manufacturing trees in the early 1960s 95 
percent of the people said theyd never have an artificial tree 
he said 
spiegel has been in the artificial christmas tree business about 
30 years he was president of american tree and wreath 
headquartered in mt vernon vt until he squarci and two others 
opened their first factory in newburgh 
the company outgrew that plant within three years and opened a 
larger one which now employs 600 
in march operations began at hudson valley trees plant in 
evansville ind spiegel says that plant which employs 200 is near 
most of the companys midwest customers 
spiegel and squarci designed and constructed the machinery used 
in the two plants 
the flow is designed for storage raw materials manufacturing 
warehousing and shipping he said raw materials go in at one 
end and finished goods come out at the other end 
hudson valley tree manufactures and sells mostly softneedle 
trees and is test marketing some hardneedle trees the companys 
hottest seller is the artificial douglas fir 
the company sells a variety of trees ranging in size from two to 
25 feet high and from 40 to 300 in price the most popular size is 
six feet which sells for about 75 spiegel says 
lately theres been a strong demand for tall trees people who 
have big homes and big ceilings want that nice big tree spiegel 
said 
artificial trees were first introduced in the 1950s roughly 3 
million are sold each year spiegel says 
he says most of his competition comes from asian suppliers of 
artificial trees and producers of live trees 
the live tree business is surging again after a period of 
shortages in the 1960s and 70s according to david e baumann 
associate executive director of the national christmas tree 
association 
baumann says live trees were in short supply until the 1980s 
because they were taken from the woods and not grown on large farms 
as they are today now theres an adequate supply of live trees and 
the competition between live and artificial suppliers is heating up 
this year for the first time ever the national christmas tree 
association plans to spend 1 million on an advertising campaign to 
promote the natural tree 
artificial trees are made by running rolls of green polyvinal 
chloride through a slitter a knifelike machine to form the 
branches 
a number of the branches are then handwrapped to a metal rod to 
create a panel a larger branch an artificial christmas tree 
is simply a series of panels hooked on the trees rod 
the advantage of the artificial version theyre perfectly 
shaped shed no needles and can be stored in a closet to rise again 
year after year 
spiegel thinks thats why artificial trees will continue to be in 
demand he says hes got much of the east coast and midwest covered 
and has his eyes turned to the west 
we never built a sales organization on the west coast so its 
a growth area for us he said

the environmental mess that has plagued 
eastman kodak co for nearly a year may be more a result of emotions 
and coincidences than pollution and poisons 
no one can say for sure 
but the company once considered the benevolent corporate father 
who could do no wrong has certainly suffered a major blow to its 
status in its hometown 
clearly our reputation at least as an environmentally 
responsible company has been brought into question and we dont 
like that said ron roberts a company spokesman 
the whole mess started last march when a newspaper article 
disclosed that some testing by kodak indicated that chemicals had 
probably leaked from kodak park the companys sprawling 
manufacturing complex into the groundwater of a neighboring 
residential area 
wall street analysts and others took notice but quickly lost 
interest 
i think the view down here was is this going to be 
catastrophic are we talking billions or hundreds of millions of 
dollars said eugene glazer an analyst for dean witter reynolds 
inc we looked at it and the answer was no 
that left the issue to be hashed out in the community 
since the first report rhetoric and charges have been furiously 
flying in numerous public hearings and blanket media coverage a 
200 million lawsuit has been filed against the company a major 
expansion project to produce more color film has been stalled 
residents of rand street have appeared on television news 
broadcasts to detail their dizziness headaches and unexplained nose 
bleeds theyve also held news conferences and protests 
one woman even put her pet rabbit who died during the uproar in 
the freezer to save as possible proof that chemicals were moving out 
of the ground and into her home 
the way this thing was presented it sounded like kodak was 
poisoning the neighborhood said dr joel nitzkin director of the 
monore county health department its all been taken out of 
context there just isnt any evidence of any health hazard 
his department conducted studies immediately after the newspaper 
report and found nothing unusual in the rand street neighborhood 
many of the complaints were exaggerated or had common explanations 
like having a home that was too dry in the winter 
months later the health department conducted more tests in two 
schools near the manufacturing center and pronounced them safe 
yes we found contamination from the cleaning agents used in 
the schools nothing from kodak said nitzkin 
despite these preliminary findings the mess at kodak has become 
messier and messier 
after months of delays more definitive testing which will 
involve taking soil samples from several feet underground in 
backyards in the neighborhood was started this past week 
were still on the road to finding out whats going on its 
been a long and frustrating road so far said allen hall 
cochairman of concerned neighbors of kodak park a neighborhood 
group formed last march 
hall moved out of the neighborhood three weeks ago because i 
didnt feel safe there any more 
his new neighborhood in the rochester suburb of greece is 
quiet odorfree and theres no fly ash on the window sill 
the hall family is one of about 50 who have taken advantage of a 
kodak plan that helps people sell their homes or if they want to 
stay refinances their mortgage at an attractive rate and gives them 
up to 5000 for home improvements 
there are about 200 homes in the neighborhood 
meanwhile two other former residents of the neighborhood hired 
some expert environmental attorneys and filed a lawsuit claiming 
residents of the area are in grave danger they hope to persuade 
state supreme court justice raymond cornelius to grant the suit 
class action status 
on the heels of the rand street situation a new federal law 
required kodak and every other company in the country that uses 
chemicals to disclose how many and how much of them were being 
discharged into the environment 
when the company in july revealed that 9 million pounds of 
methylene chloride were being released into the air albeit in very 
diffuse amounts people were shocked 
any time you talk about millions of pounds of anything it 
blows peoples minds said robert wilson an assistant professor 
of environmental health sciences at the university of rochester 
but he said that number is nearly as frightening as it sounds 
because studies on the dangers of methylene chloride are very 
equivocal 
methylene chloride a powerful solvent thats used in paint 
strippers spray paint and as an industrial solvent is at the 
center of this environmental controversy 
kodak the largest user of the solvent in new york uses it 
around the clock as a key ingredient in the manufacture of miles and 
miles of photographic film 
within the last 10 years the safety of exposure to the chemical 
has come under scrutiny and in 1985 the chemical was listed as a b2 
probable carcinogen by the environmental protection agency 
that means that theres sufficient evidence from research in 
animals to indicate that a chemical could cause cancer but no 
evidence in humans 
in fact the epa used a comprehensive kodak study of its own 
workers exposed to the chemical to determine that there were no 
significant increases in the incidence of cancer 
in october the company gathered a panel of 16 experts to review 
the current information on methylene chloride and offer an opinion 
on the danger of exposure to the chemical 
the bottom line is that when the panel members were asked if 
they would be content to live in an atmosphere that contained what 
rochesters contained the answer was absolutely said dr 
marvin kuschner chairman of the panel and a professor of pathology 
at the state university of new york at stony brook 
the final piece of the pollution puzzle occurred last month when 
with concerns of pollution at their height kodak requested a permit 
to release additional methylene chloride into the air because of its 
planned expansion 
the company is challenging the states recently revised limits on 
emissions and the state has promised a ruling later this month 
i dont know why all these things have happened at the same 
time i dont have the luxury to think about that said al butkas 
chief supervisor of kodak affairs for the state department of 
environmental conservation it would have been a lot nicer if each 
one of these things had come in separate fiveyear blocks i can 
tell you that

more than 26000 hotel rooms in dade and broward 
counties are already booked for the super bowl and people who 
havent taken steps to find lodging may soon be out of luck 
many fans are on waiting lists and many of the top hotels are 
asking a minimum fourday stay 
no room in la casa said lisa cole spokeswoman for the 
1200room fontainebleau hilton weve been booked a solid year 
the story was the same at the biscayne bay marriott it has been 
booked for three months with 100 people on a waiting list and its 
still getting 20 calls a day the sister marriott at miami 
international airport is booked so is the marriott harbor beach 
resort in fort lauderdale 
other hotels that are booked include the hyatt regency the eden 
roc the intercontinental the shelborne and just about every other 
major miami area hotel as well as the diplomat in hollywood pier 
66 in fort lauderdale and the embassy suites in broward county 
just to name a few 
the national football league alone has reserved more than 10000 
rooms for teams and their families sponsors and the media fans 
have taken about 16000 more 
analysts estimate the need by game day jan 22 at about 35000 
rooms 
this isnt the type that drives up and down the strip looking 
for a vacancy said jim steeg nfl director of special events and 
1year veteran super bowl organizer 
one reason for the early booking may have been previous super 
bowl experiences 
at the last miami super bowl in 1979 when the steelers slid by 
the cowboys 3531 travel agents had booked many hotels solid 
leaving nfl teams and affiliates fumbling for rooms 
that was sort of upsetting steeg said 
there is hope for those still looking for rooms however 
ron kent executive director of the super bowl host committee 
said between 6000 and 7000 rooms are still available in dade and 
another 4000 to 5000 are available in broward 
kent said even more rooms will become available as fans see their 
teams shot as the playoffs dwindle and opt to cancel reservations 
and some people have gone as far as fort myers across the 
florida peninsula to secure their super bowl rooms

food giant pillsbury co announced late sunday 
that suitor grand metropolitan plc of britain is willing to raise 
its offer for pillsbury to as much as 66 a share from the current 
60 bid 
a 66ashare bid would raise the offer for pillsbury to 56 
billion grand met had been trying to take over pillsbury for 523 
billion pillsbury has around 854 million shares outstanding 
pillsbury said in a statement that its chairman philip l smith 
had met over the weekend with grand met chief executive officer 
allen sheppard the meetings did not result in any agreement between 
pillsbury and grand met a major hotel and beverage conglomerate 
pillsbury noted 
the announcement came a day before the takeover battle is to come 
to a head monday when a delaware court holds hearings on 
pillsburys antitakeover poison pill the cornerstone of its 
defense against grand met 
last month minneapolisbased pillsbury announced it would make 
its burger king corp a separate company complete with its own 
board of directors and newly issued stock the spinoff would occur 
dec 19 
the move has been widely viewed as a lastditch effort by 
pillsbury to fend off grand met 
then on dec 2 pillsbury announced it has agreed to sell its 
grain merchandising division a chain of restaurants and a food 
division 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg denied that the sales terms of 
which were not disclosed were made in reaction to the takeover 
attempt he added that plans to sell the grain merchandising 
division were announced july 25 
pillsbury sold the grain division to conagra inc a diversified 
food company based in omaha neb with annual sales of 95 
billion haeg said it was not known how much the division was worth 
but said it was part of the companys industrial foods division 
which had sales of 416 million last year 
pillsbury also said it was selling bay street a chain of 12 
seafood restaurants based in dallas the chain was sold to bay 
street restaurant inc a management group led by bay street general 
manager alan r palmieri and bill bouffard president of restaurant 
capital corp an investment group 
also sold was ashford creameries a division of fiesta foods ltd 
of britain a marketer of frozen desserts and ice cream it was sold 
to londonbased hillsdown holdings plc 
at an initial meeting on friday evening pillsbury said sheppard 
indicated he was prepared to increase grand mets offer to 63 a 
share smith responded that he was not willing to discuss at this 
time a price which was not in the range of 68 to 73 a share 
on saturday morning grand met indicated it was making a formal 
offer of 65 a share 
pillsbury said its board of directors met sunday to consider the 
65ashare proposal but there was no enthusiasm for it 
at a meeting on sunday afternoon sheppard indicated that 
although 65 was his official final offer 66 a share could be 
available according to the statement 
pillsbury said its board has authorized smith to be available for 
any discussions with grand met officials which are designed to 
maximize values to pillsbury shareholders 
attorneys for grand met have said the company would have to lower 
its offer should the burger king spinoff occur because it would 
present a huge tax liability for grand met 
mondays hearing in delaware chancery court is on grand mets 
renewed motion directing pillsbury to invalidate its poison pill 
defense the pill would make a takeover prohibitively expensive the 
tender offer is conditioned on the removal of the pill 
dissident shareholders also have sued to have the pill 
invalidated but courts in delaware and minnesota have left it 
intact
