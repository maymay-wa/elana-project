space shuttle columbias astronauts 
photographed north africa for a film documenting damage to the 
planet monday as they whirled around the world on their seventh day 
in space 
clear skies gave the astronauts the chance to shoot pictures of 
lake chad the nile valley and fires in kenya for a giantscreen 
imax film called planet earth on the damage man and nature are 
doing to earth 
after a full days work and an eighthour rest mission control 
awoke the crew about 1115 pm to begin their eighth day in space 
as has become the practice they were awakened to the strains of 
a college fight song in honor of the astronauts alma maters for 
tuesday it was the university of colorado from which crew member 
marsha ivins graduated in 1973 the song is based on the tune 
battle hymn of the republic 
good morning buffaloes ms ivins responded referring to 
the schools mascot 
earlier monday the five crew members also worked on several 
medical and scientific experiments that have been the focus of 
their 10day flight since the two main objectives releasing a 
satellite and capturing another were completed last week 
columbia is scheduled to land friday at 259 am pst 
the astronauts work day began a little early when their sleep 
was interrupted sunday by a buzzing alarm that indicated a brief 
problem with a navigation system five unexplained signals from a 
sensor on the system tripped the alarm but posed no threat to the 
mission officials said and the astronauts returned to bed 
when they woke up as scheduled two hours after the alarm 
sounded mission control told them scientists had monitored the 
suspect unit but detected no further problems columbia commander 
dan brandenstein then successfully tested the system and put it 
back into operation 
everything is going well flight director al pennington said 
monday morning theyve had a very good day in fact theyre 
having a very busy day today 
during the day mission specialist bonnie dunbar had difficulty 
with one experiment in which she must seal the lower half of her 
body inside a container resembling a collapsible vacuum bag 
in the experiment an astronaut drinks a saline solution and 
spends time in the container which gently pulls the bodys fluids 
toward lower body parts in space fluids tend to move toward the 
upper body researchers hope the two techniques will prevent 
astronauts from having trouble standing when they return to earth 
dunbar had trouble with the devices waist seal which 
apparently doesnt work quite the same in weightlessness as it does 
on earth and needed some assistance from ms ivins and mission 
specialist david low 
mission control awoke the astronauts with the university of 
washington fight song dunbar is a washington graduate 
good morning for your second wakeup of the morning the 
control center said referring to the earlier alarm 
ground controllers also apologized to the crew for having to 
work on a holiday 
sorry you have to work through the martin luther king jr 
holiday but youre doing so well that no one wants to give you a 
break mission control said in morning messages sent to the crew 
via the shuttles fax machine 
columbia pilot jim wetherbee received a special message a 
certificate from sundays houston tenneco marathon wetherbee ran 
on a treadmill at about the same time his mother althea 
participated in the 262mile marathon mrs wetherbee had asked 
him to be her pace partner in space 
wetherbees certificate said he ran the marathon in 54 
seconds the time it took him to travel 262 miles in orbit his 
70yearold mother the oldest female to participate finished in 
four hours 59 minutes and seven seconds 
you were awarded an honorary completion certificate for the 
marathon many of us were surprised you werent disqualified for

leaders of andean nations 
under the reported antidrug effort the navy was to operate an 
aircraft carrier battle group off the caribbean coast of colombia

dinh hong qui is finding it no 
easy task to begin life anew in impoverished northern vietnam after 
voluntarily returning home from the squalid camps of hong kong 
at present i am doing nothing i havent any job and i have to 
rely on my parents the 28yearold man said in a recent 
interview in coastal quang ninh province for the time being it 
is very difficult 
qui and his wife are among nearly 1000 people who have 
voluntarily returned from the british colony after finding their 
dreams for a new life abroad dashed by the hong kong policy of 
considering vietnamese asylumseekers who arrive by boat illegal 
immigrants 
about 44000 boat people who have sailed into hong kong since 
june 1988 face repatriation against their will unless they can 
prove they fled political persecution or return voluntarily under a 
program sponsored by the united nations high commissioner for 
refugees 
charleshenry bazoche head of the un agencys mission in 
hanoi acknowledged the economic difficulties faced by the 
returnees but believes that marketoriented economic reforms under 
way in communist vietnam will lead to rapid improvement 
they have made a reasoned mature decision bazoche said of 
the voluntary returnees they know that hong kong is a dead end 
the economic situation in vietnam is evolving very fast i 
do believe the next four years will see many more changes he 
said i am deeply convinced that life in vietnam is better than 
in a camp anywhere 
bazoche noted the number of boat people seeking voluntary 
repatriation from hong kong has been on the rise with about 2000 
applications pending 
more than 230 of the boat people who have voluntarily returned 
are from quang ninh a northern province of hauntingly beautiful 
coastline where sampans sail between islands of dramatic rock 
formations 
qui and his wife last spring left behind jobs as a factory 
welder and tourist official with a total monthly salary of about 
16 and sold their house to help pay for seats on a boat to hong 
kong which cost 500 in gold 
soon after they arrived in the british colony however they 
became fed up with the strange food and cramped conditions in the 
detention centers and decided to apply for repatriation 
the couple boarded a chartered flight to vietnam on nov 30 and 
have been living at the austere brick home of quis parents which 
is simply decorated with ornamental chili plants flanking the 
doorway and a poster of miss hanoi inside 
qui whose wife is six months pregnant hopes he can borrow 
enough money from friends to start his own mechanical repair 
business if im lucky in doing my business life will be much 
better but if im not lucky maybe not he said 
cao van lam a voluntary returnee who lives with his parents 
down the road from qui wants to start his own carpentry business 
but also lacks capital 
lam 25 said he has had difficulty finding work ever since 
leaving the army last year i just want to have a normal life to 
do business he said i think my hope will be fulfilled 
the un agency provides 50 in cash to each returning adult to 
help with initial resettlement costs but the money often is 
squandered 
lam for example said he spent the money on cigarettes while 
qui spent part of his grant on beer and wine for a farewell party 
in hong kong 
the united nations also provides vietnamese who return 
voluntarily with a monthly allowance of 30 for one year but 
bazoche said what is really needed are development programs in the 
northern provinces where most of the boat people set sail 
while un officials believe the voluntary return program can 
play a big role in reducing the number of vietnamese languishing in 
hong kong camps another massive influx of boat people this year 
would trigger demands in the colony for quicker action 
officials in quang ninh and the nearby port city of haiphong say 
they have launched a media campaign to dissuade vietnamese from 
sailing to hong kong about 500 miles to the northeast 
newspapers and radio have stories quoting returning vietnamese 
describing how hard and painful life is in the hong kong camps 
said tran xuan nguyen a provincial official in quang ninh 
the province also has cracked down on people organizing the boat 
journeys to hong kong with more than 135 defendants accused of 
such crimes last year he said 
haiphong officials believe that since august nobody has left 
for hong kong from the port a popular staging ground for boat 
people they express optimism that the number of departures in the 
spring sailing season will fall below the massive waves of the past 
two years 
i think that the number of people that are going to leave 
vietnam will be limited to the minimum said hoang ngoc tri a 
haiphong government official who deals with the returning boat 
people 
its very difficult to predict the actual figure but we want 
to stop it immediately absolutely he said all we can do is 
try our best

hilda the hippo en route to a reunion 
with her mate harvey escaped from her truck on a busy highway but 
her brief taste of freedom ended in death 
the truck hilda was traveling in jackknifed on a busy highway at 
thruxton in hampshire 65 miles west of london and the threeton 
hippopotamus escaped 
she ambled along the highway nibbling at the grass and even 
managed a quick nap as passing motorists blinked in disbelief 
several swerved to miss hitting her 
but experts said the stress of the accident and the trauma of 
being hauled into another trailer after being knocked out with a 
sedative proved too much for the 10yearold hippo who died 
shortly after her recapture 
local veterinarian geraint griffiths said the problem was that 
it was impossible to get hilda into the new trailer quickly and 
give her an early antidote to the sedative because of her sheer 
weight 
hilda was being transferred from longleat safari park in 
wiltshire to windsor safari park where she was to join harvey 
i think she jumped up and tried to turn round and that turned 
the trailer over said her driver mike vandy 
griffiths was called in to sedate hilda with a tranquilizing 
dart so she could be caught and put in a replacement truck 
but it took an hour of heaving and pushing to lift hilda into 
the truck and the difficult operation was only completed after a 
vehicle normally used for lifting heavy commercial vehicles was 
called in to help 
a hampshire police spokesman speaking anonymously said she 
was extremely wellbehaved and docile its a great shame to hear 
that she has died

bulgarias former communist ruler could 
soon face criminal charges his east german counterpart elderly 
and ill is under investigation for corruption and high treason 
and the former czech party chief is in limbo with charges against 
him still possible 
such is the fate of east europes leaders whose stalinist 
systems held 111 million people in the kremlins satellite 
countries in an iron grip for more than 40 years before being swept 
out by prodemocracy movements 
romanias nicolae ceausescu met a violent end he was executed 
dec 25 in part for ordering his security troops to fire on 
civilians who eventually overthrew his government 
only polands gen wojciech jaruzelski has managed to keep a 
government post 
the most dramatic changes came in east germany bulgaria 
czechoslovakia and romania in revolutions over a 10week period 
from october through december 
erich honecker the longtime communist leader of east germany 
was the first to go ousted by his own politburo on oct 18 as 
massive street demonstrations swept the country and thousands of 
citizens emigrated to the west 
prosecutors have been investigating honecker for corruption and 
abuse of power the nations top prosecutor hansjuergen joseph 
said monday the investigation had been expanded to include high 
treason and anticonstitutional associations 
honecker 77 underwent what was said to be successful surgery 
jan 10 to remove a malignant kidney tumor 
he had been placed under house arrest when the investigations 
first started but sources said a security cordon around honeckers 
opulent residential compound near east berlin was removed several 
weeks ago because no legal grounds were established to detain 
him 
at least 30 former top officials are under investigation in east 
germany and most are under arrest they include ousted trade union 
boss harry tisch and guenther mittag who oversaw the centrally 
planned economy 
bulgarias todor zhivkov was dumped by party comrades nov 10 
after 34 years in power for resisting reforms championed by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev he too could face prosecution 
he has been accused of ruining the economy and leading bulgaria 
into international isolation largely because of his brutal 
suppression of the countrys 15 million ethnic turks 
we think the charges will be abuse of power fraud 
crimes against the consititution depriving the whole people of 
their rights said petar beron a member of a parliamentary 
investigatory commission 
the panel also is looking into the zhivkovs alleged diversion 
of bulgarian government funds into swiss bank accounts and misuse 
of state money to build more than 30 villas around the country 
zhivkov is being protected from the wrath of the people at 
his boyana residence near sofia beron said his trial date will be 
set after the investigation is completed probably in late january 
only one top communist functionary is known to be under arrest 
in czechoslovakia 
miroslav stepan the former prague party boss was charged with 
abuse of power allegedly for ordering the bloody crackdown on 
demonstrating students nov 17 that triggered the nations peaceful 
revolution 
national communist party chief milos jakes was ousted on nov 24 
and his fate is still unclear a parliamentary commission 
investigated the crackdown and apparently found that jakes was not 
involved 
however a separate communist party commission investigating 
abuse of political power ordered jakes stepan and vasil bilak the 
partys hardline ideologist to resign from the party 
gustav husak who came to power after the prague spring 
reform movement was crushed by the sovietled invasion in 1968 
resigned as head of state dec 10 
husak and 30 other senior officials were suspended from the 
party by a party congress earlier this month pending results of 
the party investigation 
ceausescu was toppled in a bloody revolution that began on dec 
15 
at least half a dozen members of the ceausescu clan including 
son nicu and daughter zoiaelena are under arrest and awaiting 
trial 
state television reported monday that another son valentin and 
ousted officials including former communist party secretary emil 
bobu will go on trial this week on charges of bringing economic 
ruin on romania and aiding genocide in the killing of thousands by 
during the december uprising 
in hungary where reforms came earlier janos kadar was removed 
as party leader in 1988 he died in july 
kadars reformist successor karoly grosz was overtaken by the 
pace of change and relieved last year by a new group of reformers 
they dissolved the communist party in october and established a new 
westernoriented socialist party 
in november hungarians voted overwhelmingly in a referendum for 
the party to make all its assets public 
the east bloc leader who seems to have best survived the 
revolutionary turbulence in eastern europe is polands jaruzelski 
the armed forces chief 
the polish national assembly elected him president july 19 and 
he has worked closely since then with the solidarityled government 
it was jaruzelski who decreed martial law in december 1981 to 
crush the independent labor union and it was jaruzelski who 
accepted the powersharing arrangement last summer when it became 
obvious that poland could not be governed without solidaritys 
participation

its been a year since the charismatic 
director of oregons prison system was stabbed to death outside his 
office authorities discount his familys claim that he was killed 
by corrupt elements within the prison system but concede they have 
no suspects 
the slaying of michael francke one of state governments rising 
stars last jan 17 distressed this capital city the fact that a 
massive investigation has yielded no suspects has kept interest in 
the case high 
it was about 1230 am and night watchman stephen rubino was 
told to be especially observant as he made his rounds of the dome 
building 
as he came to a dimly lit porch at the side of the building 
rubino spotted a large man sprawled on the porch he was surrounded 
by bloodstains and a panel of glass at the porch doorway was 
smashed 
the night watchman had discovered franckes body an autopsy 
would later show that francke died from a stab wound to the heart 
today the killing haunts those familiar with the case 
its been frustrating says marion county district attorney 
dale penn who has orchestrated one of most extensive criminal 
investigations in the states history 
despite interviews with thousands of people including several 
convicts and a reward fund exceeding 20000 the 20 or so 
fulltime investigators assigned to the case havent reported any 
big breaks 
penn said hes convinced the killer is a darkhaired man with a 
lightcolored coat who was seen running from the scene but that 
mans identity is unknown he said 
im not willing to predict when or if an arrest will be 
made penn said in an interview 
francke 42 was recruited from new mexico where he was 
director of prisons in may 1987 he was known for his dynamic 
speaking style and his trademark cowboy boots 
he apparently was attacked at about 7 pm as he was leaving 
work for the day and walking to his car parked outside the dome 
building headquarters of the corrections department 
despite his mortal wound francke managed to make it back to the 
building where he broke a panel of glass in a doorway before 
collapsing on the porch 
coworkers found franckes car with a door ajar in the parking 
lot but his body wasnt found until five hours later when rubino 
made his rounds under orders to be especially alert because francke 
couldnt be contacted 
though no arrests have been made the story has stayed in the 
news over the past year due in large part to the efforts of 
franckes family 
theyve publicly prodded investigators to pursue the possibility 
that francke was killed to prevent him from exposing highlevel 
corruption in the state corrections department 
penn and state officials say no one has produced any firm 
evidence to back that claim a recent investigation by a retired 
judge appointed by gov neil goldschmidt to look into the 
possibility turned up no link between franckes death and alleged 
corruption in the department 
in a report issued last month retired court of appeals judge 
john warden did find evidence of wrongdoing by about 15 corrections 
employees most of them guards but said there was no link between 
it and franckes death 
but franckes younger brother kevin francke said the family 
doesnt buy the revenge or robbery motives advanced by penn and 
others connected with the investigation 
kevin francke said he finds it especially unlikely that his 
brother who went to college on a football scholarship was killed 
when he interrupted someone trying to break into his car 
he pointed out franckes money wallet and rolex watch werent 
taken and that there was no sign of forced entry into the car 
he wasnt stupid enough to confront an individual with an 
8inch knife kevin francke said by telephone from port 
charlotte fla 
more likely he said francke was silenced before he had a 
chance to lower the boom on corrections officials guards and 
inmates who were involved in an alleged drug ring in the prisons 
he said michael francke had told him hed uncovered an organized 
criminal element in the department 
drugs and drug money i think thats the main thing kevin 
francke said i believe it involved corrections officials 
corrections employees and inmates 
for his part penn said his office has given lie detector tests 
to top corrections officials and found nothing to substantiate 
kevin franckes allegations 
i do not believe that corruption within the corrections 
department is a viable motive in this case the district attorney 
said 
it is unreasonable to believe that a whole group of 
corrections officials could pass polygraph exams and continue to 
conceal a conspiracy he said

business leaders say their young 
democracy will be threatened unless panama receives financial aid 
to compensate for the looting unemployment and destruction caused 
by the us invasion 
if the united states truly expects democracy to flourish you 
need a flourishing economy said laurence berger vice president 
of the american chamber of commerce in panama all the goodwill 
in the world wont mean much when you have growling stomachs 
business leaders say the bush administration has not yet offered 
any aid to make up for the millions lost due to us economic 
sanctions imposed to try to oust gen manuel antonio noriega and 
the widespread looting after the invasion 
weve been told we gave you your freedom and now its up to 
you to do what you will said alfredo l maduro president of 
the panamanian chamber of commerce 
the looting started after us troops invaded dec 20 to oust 
noriega and lasted for four days hundreds of stores were left 
without any merchandise including food clothes cars furniture 
and electronic goods 
the looting is estimated to have cost companies between 1 
billion and 2 billion and left some 30000 people without work 
bringing the unemployment rate to about 30 percent in the country 
of 22 million people 
the word democracy is going to ring hollow unless the country 
gets help and social unrest is something this new government 
doesnt need said berger whose organization is made up mostly 
of us business executives 
nearly a month after the american attack most businesses in the 
capital of panama city remain closed and many people fear this will 
spell dire economic straits for the small nation already reeling 
from two years of us sanctions imposed in 1988 to put pressure on 
the noriega military regime 
last week president guillermo endara wrote president bush 
asking for financial aid the contents of the letter were not 
released 
a us embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
endara thanked bush for the military intervention and listed six 
areas of priority panama needs help in to rebuild the economy 
one area endara said needs rebuilding is the poor neighborhood 
of el chorrillo which was mostly destroyed in the fighting 
noriegas headquarters a target of the invasion was located in 
the district 
engineers have estimated rebuilding the area to minimum 
standards will cost 40 million to 60 million 
the bush administration has not indicated any aid will be 
coming although the us military has said it will rebuild houses 
and apartments detroyed in the fighting 
its a problem that needs attention said ambassador deane 
hinton i am personally convinced that we will make a significant 
contribution 
but he added the looting was first and foremost a problem of 
panama 
hinton was in washington on monday and was to bring up the issue 
with administration officials 
although the united states has released 70 million in assets 
frozen as part of the sanctions 250 million remains unreleased 
business leaders say sanctions coupled with political unrest 
have depressed the construction banking industrial and tourism 
sectors and caused skilled panamanians to leave the country and 
seek work elsewhere 
the chambers of commerce say the standard of living has dropped 
to what it was 10 years ago mostly because of the sanctions they 
also claim the invasion jeopardized the commercial and insurance 
sectors 
the chambers estimate about 300 to 500 million in aid would be 
sufficient to stave off further economic woes and say the united 
states should help panama as it did the dominican republic after 
us troops moved in in 1965 
we are a country of 22 million people so a relatively small 
of amount of help will go a long way said berger 
government officials say the plundering occurred only because 
there was an absence of security forces panamanian or american on 
the streets the police part of noriegas panamanian defense 
forces were involved in the fighting 
there was anarchy in the streets martial law should have been 
declared said berger he said the troops should have helped 
prevent looting by barricades and patrols 
a key issue of the debate is that many insurance companies do 
not cover acts of war 
maduro and berger say both the panamanian and us governments 
should come out with a statement clarifying whether the invasion 
was indeed war 
neither government wants to take a position on whether this 
was a war or not said maduro it may be semantics but it has 
legal implications a formula has got to be worked out or we have 
to work through a back door 
they are also asking for 
pressure by the us government to persuade insurance 
companies to recognize legitimate claims 
low interest loans in construction and commercial financing 
export guarantees to us suppliers that would allow more 
expanded credit

members of massachusetts armenian community 
stayed in touch with friends and relatives in azerbaijan on monday 
and urged moscow to prevent the bloody ethnic conflict from 
escalating into civil war 
there are thousands of armenians who live in azerbaijan and 
their lives are very insecure at this point said the rev dajad 
davidian of st james armenian church in suburban watertown what 
we want to see is some kind of public security take place 
dikran kaligian executive director of the armenian national 
committee of the eastern united states said the boston areas 
50000member armenian community is the second largest in the 
nation outside of los angeles 
in new york city armenianamericans demonstrated monday outside 
the soviet mission appealing for an end to the bloodshed 
its one of the saddest moments in contemporary history 
said archbishop megrob ashjian prelate of the armenian church of 
america and a protest leader in the eyes of the civilized world 
genocide is perpetrated 
about 100 protesters waved american and armenian flags chanted 
gorbachev stop the killing in reference to the soviet leader 
and sang a nationalistic anthem that translated as the enemy 
wants to kill us but we are here to stay 
ashjian said there are about 1 million armenianamericans 
150000 of them in the new york city area 
in los angeles garen yegparian executive director of the 
western office of the armenian national committee blamed the 
azerbaijanis most of whom are shiite moslems for the clashes with 
the armenians who mostly are christians 
what theyve started is not unexpected for us said 
yegparian its in line with their previous behavior 
kaligians watertownbased organization has been in constant 
contact with soviet armenians in azerbaijan everyone is involved 
because its a matter of life and death he said 
the violence broke out this weekend between predominantly moslem 
azerbaijanis and mostly christian armenians who are battling over 
nagornokarabakh a mainly armenian region of 160000 people 
controlled by azerbaijan since 1923 
official reports monday said hundreds of azerbaijanis and 
armenians fought with submachine guns helicopters and armored 
vehicles taken from military bases and that at least 37 had been 
killed 
kaligian said the death toll was probably a great deal higher 
those are obviously the initial figures he said the 
actual numbers are difficult to get because foreign newsmen are 
barred from the region 
manoog s young chairman of the board of the national 
association for armenian studies and research in suburban belmont 
predicted the hostilities could be quelled before a fullscale 
civil war broke out 
i dont think its a classic civil war situation he said 
i think before it will be allowed to get to that point im sure 
the soviet troops will intervene and put a lid on it 
somehow moscow has got to exert more influence they have to 
bring a stop to the bloodshed thats going on he said its 
come to the point that unless they get some control this will blow 
completely out of proportion 
kaligian said the reasons behind the fighting were not simple 
this situation is often being portrayed as a religious 
struggle or an ageold struggle kaligian said this is a 
political issue and an issue of survival 
davidian said the armenian community believes the azerbaijanis 
have more troops and more arms than the armenians making the 
battle difficult to win 
one of our big fears right now in the past week is now that 
theyve torn down the barriers we have a real fear that heavy 
military equipment is being taken into azerbaijan 
davidian said the civil strife in azerbaijan has taken a toll on 
the victims of armenias devastating december 1988 earthquake 
most of the supplies that come in from land come in through 
azerbaijan these supplies are effectively being blockaded he 
said

a couple found themselves stuck with just 
half a house after a legal dispute divided their twosection 
modular home 
its really something wouldbe homeowner michael cady said 
monday our living room is there and two bedrooms over at the 
supply company they have the kitchen the bathrooms and the other 
living room 
the problem began jan 5 when pennlyon homes of selinsgrove 
pa delivered the modular house in two sections one section was 
put on the foundation at the cadys lot then a deputy sheriff 
showed up with a court order the section still on the truck was 
seized and taken to lp adams the building material company 
adams claims it is owed 14000 by the cadys contractor 
pegasus construction services which distributes pennlyon homes 
but the cadys attorney mitchell boraski said the house 
belonged to the couple because they had given a 36000 check to 
the pennlyon driver 
on monday thomas j hamel an attorney for lp adams said the 
company never intended for the cadys to become caught in the 
dispute he said an agreement has been reached that will allow the 
cadys to move into their western massachusetts home this week 
instead of having the cadys out in the cold with only half a 
house ive agreed to suspend my levy if pennlyon will escrow the 
funds theyve received hamel said 
andrew hochberg attorney for pegasus owner vincent carchedi 
said his client had tried to work out terms to pay the lp adams 
debt to no avail 
hes a building contractor hes trying to make a living in a 
soft market hochberg said 
cady said he and his wife laurie have been saving for seven 
years to buy the home and they had videotaped the arrival of the 
first section 
mrs cady said she had returned to work when her sister who was 
working the video camera called her to say the house was being 
seized 
it was just horrendous mrs cady said 
cady who recently was certified as a teacher said his wife and 
their two daughters are eager to move into the 74000 house 
the only thing weve paid for right now is the foundation and 
obviously they cant take that he said

us sen bob dole says the united states should 
cut foreign aid to israel egypt the philippines turkey and 
pakistan by 5 percent and give the money to new democracies in 
poland hungary panama and other countries 
dole a kansas republican who is the senate minority leader 
made the suggestion in an opinion piece published in tuesdays 
editions of the new york times 
the five countries he named as targets for reductions receive 
more than twothirds of us foreign assistance 
does it make sense at this historic moment to provide these 
countries practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing 
dramatically promising new aid initiatives in eastern europe or 
other important countries dole wrote what about for example 
those latin american nations in the front lines in the war against 
drugs 
a 5 percent cut in aid to israel egypt the philippines turkey 
and pakistan would free about 330 million dole said 
the united states plans to spend 145 billion on foreign aid 
this year of that israel is allocated 3 billion and egypt is to 
receive 2 billion

the us government gives threequarters of 
the contraceptives donated to third world countries including 
nearly 7 billion condoms over the last two decades according to 
the agency for international development 
since 1968 the agency has purchased 5677 million worth of 
contraceptives for distribution to 75 countries 69 billion 
condoms 16 billion cycles of oral contraceptives 497 million 
intrauterine devices and 165 million vaginal foaming tablets 
the agency reported 
duff gillespie the agencys director for population said 
overseas orders for condoms rose from 535 million in the 1988 
fiscal year to 735 million in the year ending on sept 30 he said 
the increase was due in part to the fight against aids but also to 
the growth of the agencys population activities 
details of the population program appeared in the fall 1989 
edition of usaid highlights an agency publication distributed 
to reporters last week 
gillespie said the agency has overcome some of the hostility to 
family planning of many third world leaders who have suspected a 
hidden western policy of countries to keep down their influence by 
reducing their population 
these countries have had growth thats historically 
unprecedented he said in an interview 
he said in africa the population is expected to double in 24 
years at the present rate of increase and leaders are trying to 
cope with increasing demand for schools housing and social 
services 
in places like kenya the government is enthusiastic for family 
planning said spokesman jerry lipscomb 
kenya in east africa has one of the worlds highest birth 
rates the central intelligence agency estimates its population of 
more than 23 million people is growing by 44 percent a year 
eight times as fast as the population of japan for example 
the agency cited one program in kenya that serves an area of 
350000 people it said 43 percent of the married women there now 
practice birth control compared with only 17 percent in the 
country as a whole and women there average 52 children compared 
with 77 
the publication noted the us government does not support 
abortion or what it called coercive family planning 
president reagans antiabortion policy led to a tense 
controversy with congress over the united nations fund for 
population activities because the fund helped china where 
abortion was reportedly forced on some women us contributions 
were opposed by reagan and many of his supporters last november 
president bush refused to sign a bill on foreign aid until congress 
cut out a provision of 15 million for the fund 
since 1981 the agency has spent 29 billion on population 
control activities ranging from research to financing popular 
songs about the dangers of pregnancy 
the agency publication said in 20 countries where it spent the 
most money the average number of children per family has dropped 
from 61 in the 1960s to 45 in the late 1980s

throughout much of eastern europe there is a 
sense of exhilaration as the new decade dawns with the demise of 
authoritarian rule giving hope for a freer more prosperous future 
latin america was imbued with somewhat the same spirit 10 years 
ago when one by one discredited military dictatorships were 
surrendering power to elected civilians 
the democratic transformation of that region is now almost 
complete but in one sense latin americas evolution has brought 
more pain than progress over the past decade the average citizen 
is poorer now than in 1980 
east europeans may face a similar plight poles got a taste on 
new years day of how difficult the transition is from communism to 
a free market system the prices of gasoline and bus fares were 
doubled on jan 1 while the cost of heating oil and electricity 
rose fourfold it will be a while before poles live like parisians 
the experience in latin america must make some nostalgic for the 
era of corrupt dictators the 1980s are known in the region as the 
lost decade a time when up to half of its export earnings were 
consumed by foreign debt repayment when the average annual 
inflation reached 470 percent and when all the main indicators of 
economic performance production investment and consumption 
were below the levels of 10 years ago 
there were riots last year in two of the betteroff countries 
argentina and venezuela ironically the country with the best 
economic performance was chile where the generals are for the 
time being still in charge 
the decade of democracy has also been a decade of 
disillusion writes douglas payne of freedom house a 
prodemocracy research group in new york 
he blames powerful traditions of monopoly regulation and 
protectionism inherited from the colonial era and the huge 
moneyguzzling state corporations and corrupt nowork 
bureaucracies that were created during the 1960s and 70s 
indeed cuban president fidel castro thinks his country is doing 
quite well next to the latin american democracies the united states 
has assiduously promoted over the past decade many of his 
countrymen of course disagree 
castro has said cuba is the only country in latin america which 
has not closed factories schools or hospitals 
were the only country which is developing modestly but 
strategically castro said in an appearance before the national 
assembly that body approved a resolution pledging the island 
will first sink into the sea before we agree to pull down the 
banners of the revolution and socialism 
the resolution was approved on dec 27 just a few days after 
the people of romania ousted a system much like cubas in one of 
the most remarkable mass uprisings in modern history 
it was a regime which except for secret police hirelings 
seemed to have no defenders and the pattern was much the same last 
year elsewhere in eastern europe 
the question now is whether that region will suffer the same 
economic fate as the new democracies in latin america 
robert d hormats a former top state department economic 
affairs expert warns the transition and the new leadership in 
eastern europe could be jeopardized if living standards do not 
quickly improve 
economic transformation will take years hormats says in 
the near term cutting subsidies for food and rent closing 
obsolete plants and laying off redundant workers could lower living 
standards 
he says the west would make one of the great mistakes in 
history if it refuses to spend the several billions needed to help 
countries through this hard period 
it is more difficult hormats says to create successful 
market economies than tear down failing socialist economies it 
will be harder still if eastern europeans do not work together and 
if the west fails to help them do so

atampts phone system had major problems 
connecting longdistance calls throughout the country monday due to 
trouble in new electronic callswitching centers the company said 
half the calls in the nation on the atampt system were not going 
through after 230 pm est about the time the problem was first 
noticed said daisy ottmann a spokeswoman for american telephone amp 
telegraph co 
the company reported that the problem was fixed by 1130 pm 
but spokeswoman sally sherwood said she could not provide any more 
details immediately on how the network was returned to normal 
obviously through a very long laborious process they were 
able to detect the problem and fix it ms sherwood said early 
tuesday 
for much of the day callers received recordings saying all 
circuits were busy and calls could not be put through atampt 
spokesmen said the problem seriously affected telemarketers 
airline reservation centers and other heavy phone users 
in my 20 years i have not seen a situation that affected as 
many cities as this spokesman burke stinson said at the 
companys basking ridge nj offices 
mci communications corp and us sprint the no 2 and no 3 
longdistance carriers after atampt said they had no problems with 
their networks 
the difficulties were traced to software that runs computerized 
callswitching gear that atampt began installing in 1987 ms 
sherwood said 
the problem was found in what is called the call signaling 
system which routes telephone calls the signaling system is 
composed of computerized data that is electronically overlaid on 
the data that carries the voice portion of a telephone call she 
said 
the signaling data includes the phone number of the party making 
the call and the number of the intended recipient of the call 
ms ottmann said it was believed that the trouble began in one 
of the approximately 100 switching centers operating and then 
spread to other centers 
its like striking the church bell in a steeple and all the 
other bells resonate this is a vibrating or resonating problem 
she said that seems to be in the software or at least its 
being transferred in the software weve never seen anything 
like this before she added its everywhere and the effects 
are random 
she said the company is in the process of installing a new 
version of the software it was not known whether this was part of 
the problem she said 
ms ottmann said the had company all but eliminated sabotage or 
a computer virus as the cause thats the only thing weve pretty 
thoroughly ruled out 
ms sherwood said the company has installed 110 of the new 
switching centers but not all of them are on line stinson said 
the trouble appeared to be affecting a substantial number of the 
operating centers 
but he added said some of the calls that didnt go through 
were due to the deliberate blocking of lines by atampt to enable it 
to diagnose the problem 
we have hundreds of people around the country trying to 
diagnose and correct this he said 
stinson said the problem was affecting all atampts lines 
including tollfree 800 numbers except for private lines that 
companies lease between their offices or plants 
he could not say how a software problem could crop up at so many 
switching centers at once 
a number of heavy users of tollfree lines reported difficulties 
cindy sheffield phone systems manager for the marriott hotels 
reservation office in omaha neb said the problem was 
devastating for her office because it wasnt receiving calls 
from prospective customers the office was receiving only 10 
percent of its normal call volume after the problem began she said 
fidelity investments a bostonbased mutual fund operator said 
callers were having trouble getting through it did have quite 
extensive impact said spokeswoman tracy gordon 
american airlines received about twothirds fewer calls than 
normal on its reservation lines after 230 pm est airline 
spokeswoman mary oneill said in fort worth texas 
trans midamerica a marketing company in omaha neb 
specializing in temporary motor vehicle license sales couldnt 
make any longdistance or 800number calls said company vice 
president florence waymire 
were dead in the water here today she said 
david haller branch manager for omahas dial america marketing 
said that if the phone problem wasnt repaired soon his 
magazinesubscription company would lose a minimum of 20000 
and thats conservative 
united airlines reported minor problems with its reservation 
system but susan brushaber a chicagobased reservation agent for 
the airline said uniteds phone system is designed so that callers 
are patched into a local phone number

debate over social security is heating up even 
before congress gets back to business with the trillions of 
dollars in baby boomers future retirement benefits casting a huge 
shadow over the political argument 
customary political rhetoric has been turned upside down with a 
leading democrat calling for a payroll tax cut and the white house 
responding no way 
the outcome may determine whether the massive social security 
trust fund bolstered by longrange payroll tax increases enacted 
in 1983 will continue to be used to mask the size of the federal 
budget deficit in an era of perennial budget shortfalls the 
social security trust fund helps pay the governments daytoday 
operations instead of building up a nest egg 
lawmakers are faced with whether to take painful action now 
such as tax increases and spending slashes or do nothing until 
the next century 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny added urgency to the 
debate with his proposal to immediately cut the social security 
payroll tax the white house said thursday it opposes the idea 
but in todays antitax climate which president bush has played 
to in calling for a cut in the capital gains tax moynihans plan 
could suddenly sprout wings and fly very high said senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
the 1983 increase in the payroll tax was enacted partly to help 
brace the government for the retirement of the 75 million members 
of the baby boom generation which will begin around the year 2010 
the latest increase to 765 percent on jan 1 from 751 
percent will bring in nearly 280 billion this year the total 
reserves should peak at 12 trillion in the year 2030 but dwindle 
rapidly thereafter 
by law the money is not stashed away but invested in treasury 
securities where it collects interest the treasury department 
uses the money the same way it uses other funds it pockets from 
securities sales to pay the governments bills 
the money pouring into the social security trust fund also helps 
make the overall federal deficit appear smaller 52 billion 
smaller last year 
that will turn around in the next century people who are 
working now will be drawing retirement funds and the government 
will have to redeem all the maturing securities the social security 
system will cash in to pay retirement benefits the shapes up as a 
major problem with no end to the governments red ink in sight 
moynihan who was a member of the 1982 social security 
commission would cut the payroll tax by 014 percent now and by 
another 096 percent next january he would begin boosting rates 
again in the year 2015 giving the country 25 years of lower taxes 
he says will help the economy grow and allow it to better afford 
the higher levies later 
his plan would also shrink the social security surplus and thus 
pump up the overall federal deficit turning up the political heat 
to address the budget shortfall 
it has now become clear that the administration intends to use 
the social security payroll tax as an ongoing permanent source of 
revenue for the general purposes of government moynihan 
chairman of the senate finance social security subcommittee said 
when he announced his plan last month 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater derided the plan last 
thursday the social security system is sound let the democrats 
fool with it not us he said 
moynihans cut would cost 62 billion over the next two years 
and critics say it would shift the burden of financing baby 
boomers retirements to later generations 
this smacks a little bit of the reagan philosophy which can 
be summed up as dont visit your grandchildren just send them the 
bill says rep andrew jacobs dind chairman of the house 
ways and means social security subcommittee 
but the proposal could be irresistible to lawmakers who love a 
chance to cut taxes 
weve been called by offices from both sides of the aisle 
says lobbyist judy schub of the american association of retired 
persons which so far has shied away from moynihans plan its 
got a lot of appeal 
moynihans proposal is one of several social security bills 
congress will face when it returns from its winter recess on jan 
23 since last january about 20 bills have been spawned excluding 
the social security trust fund from deficit calculations 
many concede the political appeal of the offbudget proposals is 
probably unstoppable in a measure of the ideas appeal the white 
house says president bush will include a version of the plan in the 
fiscal 1991 budget he presents congress on jan 29

the army plans to start burning about 
30000 tons of chemical weapons in a project designed to make the 
world safer that is arousing concern in some of the eight states 
where the destruction will occur 
we feel it is a risky scenario said linda kaplovitz an 
environmentalist who lives near the aberdeen proving ground where 
tons of mustard blistering agent are stored and will be burned 
we dont want another bhopal or chernobyl god forbid she 
said 
such fears are overdrawn said col walter l busbee commander 
of the armys chemical demilitarization program he was 
interviewed at his headquarters a low cinder block building 
overlooking the chesapeake bay 25 miles northeast of baltimore 
the nineyear 31 billion project has undergone rigorous 
scientific scrutiny he said adding the burning will not begin 
until he is satisfied with a test program due to begin in march on 
a remote pacific island congress has ordered the army to destroy 
almost all of its aging chemical arsenal by 1997 
after the 16month test destruction will begin at eight other 
sites in maryland kentucky alabama utah indiana oregon 
arkansas and colorado 
under pressure from congress the army scheduled destruction 
last at the two most populous sites aberdeen and at the 
lexingtonbluegrass army depot in kentucky busbee said 
environmental concerns are twofold that a destruction facility 
could explode or leak and that the exhaust cannot be scrubbed 
clean 
each part of the facility will be sealed against leaks and 
reinforced against explosions busbee said 
im not telling you that there will never be an accident or an 
incident he said but added the probability we think is 
very low 
mrs kaplovitz cited a long list of possible pollutants from the 
facility including dioxins which researchers blame for ailments 
ranging from headaches to birth defects cancer and toxic poisoning 
the environmental organization greenpeace international has 
warned that gases given off at the test site on johnston atoll 800 
miles southwest of hawaii could harm marine life 
we feel that the army has ignored quite a few major 
environmental concerns said sebia hawkins a greenpeace activist 
in washington 
the armys approach was recommended by the national academy of 
sciences and the plans were reviewed by the environmental 
protection agency and the department of health and human services 
harvard university chemist matthew meselson said the facilities 
are likely to cause less pollution than many urban refuse 
incinerators because the chemical reactions are more predictable 
and more easily monitored 
there is something that has to be recognized here and that is 
that we are going to do this once we are not building something 
for mankind for its indefinite future it doesnt have to be the 
last word in technology said meselson who previously has 
challenged the government on other issues 
busbees organization is to begin the test run of its first 
fullscale destruction facility on johnston atoll in march burning 
chemical agents that were stored on okinawa until 1971 and others 
that are scheduled to be moved from west germany sometime in the 
next two years 
if it operates as it is designed and i will not operate it 
any other way nothing will come down but a plume of nearly pure 
exhaust said busbee 
the weapons to be destroyed are decades old and consist of the 
nerve agents sarin and vx and the mustard blistering agents h hd 
and ht contained in mines artillery shells rockets and storage 
tanks 
although the bush administration is negotiating a global 
convention to ban chemical arms it also is producing a new 
generation of socalled binary weapons chemical components in the 
binary weapons are kept separate until use which army officials 
say makes them safer to store or destroy 
destruction at each site will vary according to the chemicals 
there each will include two incinerators to burn the agent at 
2700 degrees fahrenheit said busbee 
the first incineration should destroy the poisons instantly and 
the second the afterburner is insurance he said the fumes 
will be scrubbed and will be monitored for toxic substances he 
said 
incineration in the continental united states will not start 
until it has been proven that is a safe way to do it said rep 
larry hopkins rky 
the kentucky legislature passed a law requiring that the 
incinerator exhaust be 999999 percent pure which busbee says is 
the armys target

members of congress get much more attention 
from television network news when they run for president than for 
their nutsandbolts work in washington says a new study 
democrat richard gephardt barely rated a mention on the evening 
news for his congressional work on the federal tax code but a bid 
for the presidency in 1988 propelled him into prime time 
the same was true for albert gore jr lloyd bentsen paul simon 
and dan quayle who found that mention on cbs nbc and abc was the 
result of their political aspirations rather than their jobs in 
congress 
as an everyday member of congress they might not ever be 
mentioned said joe s foote a former congressional staffer and 
chairman of the radiotelevision department at southern illinois 
university in carbondale 
in fact 44 percent of the house members were never mentioned on 
the nightly news programs during 198788 footes study said 
as the 1980s passed by congressional backbenchers found it 
was harder and harder to break into the national spotlight as 
defined by abc cbs and nbc foote said 
the result is that some of the newer and younger members of 
congress have fewer and fewer opportunities to influence public 
opinion he said we rarely hear their ideas 
foote who has conducted the annual analysis of lawmakers tv 
visibility for nearly a decade said the study released this week 
shows that gephardt who made an unsuccessful bid for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1988 was mentioned just 25 
times on the nightly news in 198586 during the 99th congress 
during the 100th congress shortly after gephardt announced his 
candidacy in february 1987 he totaled 253 mentions that included 
use of his name in a report a film clip or an interview 
foote based the study on the television news index and abstracts 
at the vanderbilt university news archive in nashville tenn 
which tracked mentions on the evening news programs of the three 
networks cable news network was not included 
for other lawmakers the jump from obscurity to oftenmentioned 
was a major leap after they sought the presidency or vice 
presidency sen joseph biden ddel a 1988 presidential 
candidate was mentioned 35 times in 198586 104 in 198788 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee another 1988 democratic 
hopeful rose from 27 mentions in 198586 to 209 in 198788 sen 
paul simon dill rated 15 mentions in 198586 but 200 in 
198788 
dan quayle the republican senator from indiana received six 
mentions in 198586 but skyrocketed to 172 in 198788 which 
included his election as vice president 
heading the list of mentions among the lawmakers who sought 
higher office was senate minority leader bob dole rkan with 276 
in 198586 and 486 in 198788 by virtue of those totals dole also 
led all 100 senators in tv exposure in 198788 
gore was second with 209 simon was third with 200 and sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas the 1988 democratic vice presidential 
candidate was fourth with 199 during 198586 bentsen managed 
just 14 mentions on the nightly news 
bentsen edged out quayle who was fifth among senators with 172 
mentions in 198788 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the armed services 
committee was sixth with 155 mentions and sen robert byrd 
dwva former senate majority leader was seventh with 144 
mentions in 198788 
at the bottom of the list with no mentions from 1987 to 1988 
were sens quentin burdick dnd wendell ford dky and harry 
reid dnev 
in 198788 the study found 10 percent of the members of the 
senate accounted for nearly 50 percent of all network senate 
coverage less than 3 percent of the membership in the house made 
up about 90 percent of the network house coverage during the same 
twoyear period 
gephardt led the list of house members with 253 mentions former 
house speaker jim wright dtexas was second with 196 and jack 
kemp the former new york congressman who was thwarted in his bid 
for the gop nomination was third with 193 mentions 
rep lee hamilton dind a cochairman of the congressional 
irancontra committees received 89 mentions in 198788 rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the armed services committee was fifth 
with 59 mentions

buyers of failed savings institutions in 1988 
are protesting a new regulation that revokes some of the financial 
breaks they received from the government as part of the deal 
the office of thrift supervision says savings and loans must 
meet new and tougher capital requirements regardless of whether 
they earlier received an exemption known as a forbearance 
from meeting capital standards 
institutions that fail the requirement must come up with an 
acceptable plan to raise the money or face restrictions on their 
ability to make new loans and investments 
attorneys representing buyers in the 1988 deals regard the new 
rule as a doublecross and predict the legal battle over the issue 
will reach the supreme court 
if this is upheld nobody will ever feel secure doing business 
with the government washington attorney and sampl lobbyist douglas 
p faucette said monday 
industry analysts predict some of the 86 rescue deals in 1988 
covering 205 institutions could unravel as a result of the ruling 
forcing either a second bailout or a payoff of depositors 
some would basically be targets for government takeover 
said james barth of auburn university formerly chief economist of 
the thrift office 
he added the second rescues could be even more expensive than 
the first round because of changes in the law making it less 
attractive to own thrifts 
thrift institution owners under president bushs bailout plan 
enacted in august must put up at least 150 in tangible capital 
for every 100 in loans or other investment the institution makes 
owners of some sampls acquired from the government in 1988 had 
thought the forbearances they negotiated would exempt them from 
fully meeting the standard they now learn they will have to risk 
just as much of their own money as the owners of any other 
institution 
the thrift office in a statement announcing the new rules after 
business hours on friday said the changes were required by last 
years bailout bill but attorneys representing the 1988 buyers 
dispute that and complain the government by reneging on the deals 
is in effect illegally seizing private property 
faucette predicted the owners of sampls purchased in the 1988 
deals will sue the government joining other sampl buyers from the 
early 1980s who lost a different kind of accounting break known as 
regulatory goodwill 
to me these cases have a profound impact on anyone who 
does business with the government he said i fear because of 
the dimensions of this sampl scandal congress and the public 
believe the ends justify the means 
however barth said the regulators decision on forbearances 
will probably be upheld because it is in the public interest 
requiring sampl owners to risk more of their own capital provides a 
buffer between losses and government deposit insurance it also 
gives sampl owners an incentive to operate their institutions more 
safely 
one has to question any sort of capital forbearance barth 
said still once they were granted i can understand why the 
acquirers are extremely unhappy with the rules being changed in the 
middle of the game

cutbacks in sales of hardwood timber products 
by some southeast asian countries are putting pressure on the 
united states to export more logs and rough lumber according to an 
agriculture department report 
indonesia recently announced large increases in export taxes 
that make the export of hardwood logs and lumber nearly 
prohibitive the report said 
the action puts indonesia among a growing number of asian 
countries that are curbing exports of logs and rough lumber in 
favor of sending furniture and other valueadded products made 
from wood abroad 
malaysia and the philippines have previously taken action to 
curb such exports while taiwan and thailand have officially banned 
commercial logging the report said these actions are 
increasing the pressure on the us industry to fill this growing 
gap in international supply 
the report by the departments foreign agricultural service said 
the value of us exports of solid wood products were up 15 percent 
from a year earlier in the first nine months of 1989 while imports 
were up only 7 percent 
overall exports were valued at nearly 459 billion in the 
first three quarters of last year japan accounted for 22 
billion or 48 percent of the us wood exports mostly as softwood 
logs 
canada was the secondlargest market during the 
januaryseptember period with 5015 million or 11 percent of the 
total south korea was another big overseas buyer at 2676 million 
analyst margie bauer of the usda agency said the furniture 
industry is undergoing major changes and there are opportunities 
for us exporters 
currently taiwan and to a smaller degree korea are the 
major furniture exporters in asia she said in the report the 
export furniture industries in taiwan and korea are facing severe 
problems such as workers demanding higher wages a shortage of 
labor and high production costs 
bauer added thus the industries are relocating to southeast 
asia primarily thailand malaysia singapore and indonesia 
manufacturers in taiwan and korea rely heavily on hardwood logs 
from southeast asia and hardwood products from north america 
the recent restrictions on exports by some of the southeast 
asian countries however have reduced the supply of relatively 
inexpensive hardwood logs she said as a result us hardwood 
logs lumber veneers and panel products have an enormous 
potential market in the new furniture producing countries 
while the industry in these countries is young and 
inexperienced there is little doubt that it will grow 
tremendously bauer said now is the time for the us industry 
to work together in educating these countries on the advantages of 
using us hardwoods in the manufacturing of furniture

farmers begin signing up today in the major 
1990 crop acreage programs at local agriculture department offices 
the signup runs through april 13 
participating farmers agree to setaside from production part of 
their base acreage for individual crops wheat farmers for 
example will have a basic acreage reduction program of 5 
percent while feed grains producers will have to idle 10 percent 
of their base acres 
when farmers enroll at local offices of the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service they also may ask for 
advance cash payments of 40 percent of the expected deficiency 
payments that will be due in the 1990 program 
final settlement minus the advances will be made at the end of 
the crop season when the full deficiency payments are computed the 
payments are designed to make up the difference between market 
prices and a higher target level 
the department said recently that the advance payments for 1990 
will be reduced by 14 percent as required by the omnibus budget 
reconciliation act of 1989

la gioconda heard at the metropolitan opera 
during its first season back in 1883 was presented for the first 
time this season with a sterling cast most of them relative 
newcomers to the met conductor nello santi got the sounds he 
wanted from the met orchestra 
mondays was the first performance of the opera at the met in 
seven years 
la gioconda by amilcare ponchielli is as melodic as a 
puccini opera its grand opera needing lavish sets and costumes 
which it has from beni montresors designs for the mets opening 
week in lincoln center in 1966 it also calls for a huge chorus a 
big ballet and big emotional voices 
ghena dimitrova had a rough edge on her voice in the first two 
acts in the title role but its a passionate role so not 
inappropriate and her voice was more attractive in the last two 
acts the bulgarian soprano made her met debut as turandot in 1987 
the met announced in september that luciano pavarotti wouldnt 
be singing enzo as planned and nicola martinucci would sing 
however bruno beccaria who has a fresh opentoned 
youngsounding voice sang with vigor and made a triumph 
alain fondary from paris who made his met debut in 1988 is 
just the kind of baritone the met needs as a spy he put a menacing 
edge on his large voice but his vocal beauty flowed through 
showing that he neednt always sound evil his low notes were firm 
a couple of very high notes less so 
alexandrina milcheva also of bulgaria and also debuting in 
1987 is a mezzo but sounded like a wonderful contralto as 
giocondas mother 
stefania toczyska of poland who bowed at the met in 1988 was 
very effective as laura 
her husband was sung by a worthy met veteran paul plishka 
laura and gioconda love the same man enzo he loves laura 
which causes stress attempted murder and suicide in several 
directions 
the dance of the hours newly staged this season by rodney 
griffin doesnt amount to much not even getting peppy when the 
famous music speeds up

thirteen other industrial nations spend 
relatively more on elementary and secondary education than the 
united states says a report that challenges president bushs 
assertion that results not resources are the problem 
the united states leads only ireland and australia among 
industrial nations the laborbacked economic policy institute said 
monday in a briefing paper shortchanging education 
if the us were to increase spending for primary and 
secondary school up to the average level found in the other 15 
countries we would need to raise spending by over 20 billion 
annually said the report 
m edith rasell author of the report said the results were 
based on data published by the united nations educational 
scientific and cultural organization and by the federal government 
it focused on elementary and secondary education spending for 1985 
comparing expenditures as a percentage of national income 
the education department disputed the studys findings deputy 
undersecretary charles kolb in charge of the agencys budget said 
the institute used seriously flawed methodology to reach dubious 
conclusions 
kolb said the institute has mixed apples oranges and 
moonbeams to produce an indigestible concoction he said the 
united states ranks among the top five countries by the 
departments calculations 
its fun to play with numbers but it can be a dangerous 
delusion if used as a basis for public policy he said if 
nothing else this report points out the need for better math 
education 
the institutes statistics show the united states spent 41 
percent of its national income on k12 education in 1985 while the 
average abroad was 46 percent sweden spent 7 percent followed by 
austria at 59 percent switzerland at 58 percent norway at 53 
percent belgium at 49 percent and denmark and japan at 48 
percent 
canada spent 47 percent west germany and france 46 percent 
the netherlands and united kingdom 45 percent and italy 42 
percent 
behind the united states in spending australia spent 39 
percent and ireland spent 38 percent 
ms rasell said this is the first time that economists have 
examined the factual underpinnings of the bush administrations 
claims about education spending 
the report pointed to president bushs statement at last falls 
education summit that the us lavishes unsurpassed resources on 
schooling and our focus must no longer be on resources it 
must be on results 
according to the report we recognize that money does not 
guarantee excellence and we suspect that other changes in 
curriculum in the status of teachers and in expectations about 
students to name just a few will also be fundamental to any 
improvement in education quality and student achievement 
but to begin a process of education reform by denying the need 
to increase spending especially when us schools are underfunded 
compared to those in other industrialized countries places a 
severely limiting constraint on any plans for educational 
improvement 
to show problems with comparing relative expenditures kolb said 
that in 1986 mississippi spent per pupil 39 percent of its state 
domestic product while minnesota spent 37 percent however in 
dollars mississippi spent only 2350 per pupil compared with 
minnesotas 4180 
the report acknowledged that the us spends comparatively 
more than other countries on higher education ms rasell said 
that when expenditures on all levels of education preprimary 
primary secondary and postsecondary are calculated the united 
states is in a threeway tie for second place among the countries 
studied 
but when spending on higher education is removed from 
comparative data the report said the relative position of us 
spending falls from a threeway tie for second highest in spending 
to close to the bottom of the group of 16 industrial nations

sen bob dole is proposing that the united 
states reduce aid to israel egypt the philippines turkey and 
pakistan by 5 percent and give the money to fledgling democracies 
such as poland hungary and panama 
to me it boils down to this are big gains for freedom worth 
a small cut in a few huge foreign aid programs i say yes the 
kansas republican and senate minority leader wrote in an opinion 
piece in the new york times today 
the five countries he named as targets for reductions are the 
largest recipients of us foreign assistance they receive more 
than twothirds of us foreign aid 
does it make sense at this historic moment to provide these 
countries practically all of our aid at the cost of foreclosing 
dramatically promising new aid initiatives in eastern europe or 
other important countries dole wrote what about for example 
those latin american nations in the front lines in the war against 
drugs 
a 5 percent cut in aid to the five countries would free about 
330 million dole said 
the united states plans to spend 145 billion on foreign aid 
this year of that israel is allocated 3 billion and egypt is to 
receive 2 billion

victims of stalinist murders and 
repression in bulgaria saw their cause vindicated at last when 
parliament voted to rehabilitate dozens who suffered in dark years 
of jails and political trials 
two prominent victims nikola petkov executed in 1947 and ivan 
todorov dead of alleged suicide after his arrest in 1965 were 
among dozens of people whose honor was officially restored by 
parliamentary vote on monday 
petkov leader of the once powerful bulgarian agrarian union 
party died as communists moved throughout eastern europe to 
establish the monopoly on political power that was voted out of 
bulgarias constitution on monday 
many of petkovs associates also died in bulgarias purges 
which have never been fully examined todor zhivkov the hardline 
communist leader ousted nov 10 discouraged close examination of a 
past during his 35 years in power 
the less powerful social democratic party was also a victim of 
the communist repression in those years although it was not banned 
outright recalled a witnesss ruen krumov former editor of the 
socialist newspaper 
at least 29 prominent members of his party went to jail krumov 
told reporters he spent five years in labor camp 
im very happy he said as justice was done after decades 
they asked us what we wanted and we got what we wanted 
earlier mikhail genovsky an elderly deputy from the bulgarian 
agrarian party the rump of petkovs party allowed by the 
communists under strict control expressed more bitterness about 
the longsilenced history that now haunts the soviet union and 
eastern europe 
the blood that has been shed we cannot forget he urged 
parliament recalling how they even sent a murderer all the way 
to prague to kill another agrarian leader 
as in czechoslovakia east germany and poland where parties 
long subservient to the communists have now found an independent 
voice the agrarians in bulgaria had been pushing for petkovs 
rehabilitation even before zhivkovs ouster 
the suppression of the agrarians in the 1940s enhanced not only 
the political monopoly of the communists but also paved the way for 
collectivization of bulgarias traditionally strong peasantbased 
agriculture 
the totalitarian intolerance also doomed todorov who was 
arrested for his alleged part in plotting against zhivkov in 1965 
said to have committed suicide he is believed to have been 
murdered 
others rehabilitated monday included lyudmila slavova the 
28yearold leader of the socialist youth when she was murdered in 
jail in 1948 
as the country embarks on a journey into its past bulgarian 
newspapers have recently carried several articles about the victims 
of repression and their rehabilitation 
genovsky called for more frankness the history of his party he 
stressed was swallowed by the communists who under zhivkov kept 
the party strictly limited to 120000 members 
this was no history genovsky told deputies history is a 
science we have yet to undertake a scientific history of the 
bulgarian communist party and the agrarian party

chain saws arent just for massacres 
anymore now theyre for art too 
in vermont as in some other rural areas of the country the 
power tool best known for felling trees or as a prop in horror 
movies is being used to sculpt figures out of wood 
along route 100 between waterbury and stowe roadside 
menageries have sprouted featuring lifesize bears buffaloes 
eagles moose skunks and giraffes carved with a chain saw 
at one shop hidden behind layers of sawdust ear plugs and a 
pair of welding goggles max osorio bobs and jabs like a boxer 
except hes armed with a chain saw and his opponent is a block of 
wood 
wood chips fly curious tourists stop and watch but osorio does 
not stop it takes him eight hours to make a 6foot bear or indian 
the two pieces that sell the most 
osorio starts with a tree trunk and envisions the figure then 
he hacks at it with unwavering attention and recognizable parts 
begin to appear first the coarse head the beak then a wing the 
talons and slowly an eagle is born 
it is still very rough but when you consider i am working 
with a chain saw its remarkable boasted osorio 
i try to make the most detailed realistic sculptures as 
possible with the tool said osorio who placed second last 
summer in the fourthannual world championship chainsaw contest in 
hill city minn 
it just takes practice 
osorio a naturalized us citizen who was born in mexico began 
carving after working as a dishwasher in stowe 
one day i drove by a place and saw the wooden bears they 
were selling them for 800 and i thought to myself i could do 
that osorio said 
carving wasnt as easy as it looked but he started with a 
12inch seated bear and has worked his way up to lifesize animal 
and human figures 
once i learned how i wanted to do more than just the static 
bear sitting doing nothing i try to get detail and action he 
said 
there is plenty of action in osorios latest creation an old 
man on skis chasing a buxom skier in a bikini even the locals turn 
their heads 
osorio like other vermont carvers learned the craft at the 
spinning wheel a route 100 gift shop 
owner milo marshall said he learned the skill six years ago from 
an arizona man who was traveling through vermont 
marshalls wife emma said half of the shops 400000 gross 
annual income comes from chainsaw sculpture sales 
after two years at the spinning wheel osorio moved to the 
mousetrap a gift shop down the road some of osorios sculptures 
sell for 2000 and most between 250 and 500 with a 10 percent 
commission to the shop but osorio is reluctant to disclose how 
much he makes 
all ill say is for somebody without a degree who doesnt 
speak good english its a good living 
one statue of an indian that osorio made was so perfect he 
said he wanted to keep it for himself so he put a high price on it 
but a man from long island came and his girlfriend liked it 
he was not scared of the price osorio said the man also paid 
osorio to drive it to long island where the man wanted to stand 
the 10foot indian behind his desk 
with three shops on route 100 in waterbury selling chainsaw 
sculptures the competition is fierce but friendly 
if the place down the road specializes in pigs i wont do a 
pig osorio said but bears everybody does the bears 
pine tree creations the smallest of the three feels the 
competition owner doug joslyn said he said he recently put up a 
sign that now brings more tourists to his shop 
but if i had a quarter for every person who took a picture 
id be better off than selling them said joslyn 
mrs marshall said tour buses often stop in her shop 
some buses stop just because the people on the bus start 
screaming stop she said the lifesized buffalo stopped 
traffic for a long time

they show up on television as often as six times a 
day the advertisements with pastoral scenes of waves fields and 
forest the soothing voiceovers that ask existential questions 
about eternity and values 
a new vision more idealistic the voice promises 
despite the lack of automobile in the ad many recognize the 
spot as a commercial for infiniti the japanese luxury car but to 
some new england viewers not all is as it appears 
a series of advertisements parodying the infiniti approach has 
had new england talking laughing and watching 
questions what are we for why am i here asks a voice 
narrating one of the parodic spots as the camera shows a forest 
scene the voice continues especially when oldsmobile is having 
a great sale right now 
the camera cuts to a plug from an oldsmobile spokesman a few 
shots of cars and a running track of the theme song this is not 
your fathers oldsmobile 
when the scene returns to the forest the voice asks what is 
a factorytodealer incentive anyway it trails off wondering 
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could 
chuck 
to the makers of the infiniti ad imitation is the best form of 
flattery 
i think its a terrific parody they did a terrific job of 
playing around with our ad said chuck kushell executive vice 
president general manager at hill holliday connors cosmopulos 
inc advertising of los angeles where the infiniti ads were made 
in a november gallup poll for advertising age magazine the 
infiniti series had the best recall of all of the ads that month 
among 1000 viewers surveyed over coke over mcdonalds 
kushell said 
sidney zussman president of the new england oldsmobile dealers 
and the owner of west street motors in methuen said his group 
loved the ads and that sales at oldsmobile went up 25 percent 
during the holiday markdowns that were publicized by the ads

young men who smoke or have high cholesterol 
levels are more likely than others to show signs of heart disease 
before they reach age 35 a study shows 
the study is the first to link blood cholesterol levels and 
smoking directly to hardening of the arteries a precursor or heart 
attacks and strokes one of the studys directors said 
dr henry mcgill said monday that smoking in young men was a 
stronger risk for artery damage than he had anticipated 
in this age group smoking and cholesterol are about equally 
bad said mcgill what surprised me was the effect of 
smoking 
the findings which mcgill presented at the american heart 
associations annual science writers forum are based on autopsies 
of about 300 15 to 34yearold white men who died violent deaths 
or in accidents 
the results support the contention of many cardiologists 
including mcgill who favor early steps to prevent heart disease 
i really believe that the future of prevention of heart 
disease in middleage people has got to start in childhood he 
said 
by age 34 onefourth of the subjects already had what doctors 
call raised lesions in their arteries representing the 
beginning of hardening of the arteries 
hardening of the arteries can lead to blockage of those blood 
vessels which in turn can cause a heart attack or a stroke 
some doctors disagree with the suggestion that prevention of 
heart disease should begin in childhood 
the heart association recommends that healthy children should 
consume less than 300 milligrams of cholesterol per day and 
moderate their intake of fats but some doctors believe the 
evidence is not yet strong enough to make such recommendations 
mcgill said 
only one previous study had looked at hardening of the arteries 
in young people mcgill said 
that was a study described last year by dr gerald berenson of 
new orleans who found that artery damage in 40 children and young 
adults was worse in those who had high levels of the socalled bad 
cholesterol known scientifically as lowdensity lipoprotein or 
ldl 
mcgills study led by dr robert wissler of the university of 
chicago is the first to link the artery damage in young people to 
smoking and good cholesterol highdensity lipoprotein or hdl 
to illustrate how important the effects were mcgill said that a 
25yearold man who smoked and had high levels of good cholesterol 
would have twice the artery damage of a 25yearold nonsmoker who 
had low levels of ldl 
the findings were the first report from the study which is 
continuing and eventually will include 1800 subjects 
the study will explore how atherosclerosis is linked to high 
blood pressure diabetes inherited factors and many other 
processes inside arteries mcgill said

the newly appointed president of 
cbs entertainment says the network must overhaul its antiquated 
primetime lineup to rise out of last place in the ratings 
jeff sagansky who joined cbs two weeks ago from his position as 
president of tristar pictures said the current schedule appeals 
to viewers well over 45 years old and that the network is 
programming too narrowly in that direction 
i dont think the network can be just a narrowcasting 
vehicle sagansky said monday night 
we do need more comedies he said the question is which 
night do you open a comedy night on 
sagansky confessed that cbs is in worse shape than nbc was 10 
years ago when that network was in distant third sagansky said 
one of the obstacles to cbs comeback was that the current 
television marketplace is more competitive 
he said that one of the networks top priorities is 
reestablishing contacts with some of hollywoods more dynamic 
producers 
he said he would offer fresh talent the chance to do the show 
that theyve always wanted to do 
sagansky whose record at tristar included such flops as 
lockup and hits like steel magnolias said that the 
networks struggling pat sajak show would undergo several 
changes beginning in february but was in no immediate peril of 
cancellation 
he defended his recent cancellation of the cult favorite drama 
beauty and the beast saying its ratings came to have no 
future 
wolf which he also canceled was done in by very bad 
ratings 
he said he hoped that in five years the length of his contract 
with cbs he would have returned the network to first place 
part of his plan he said rested with the reintroduction of 
onehour dramas which have given way to situation comedies in 
recent years

communist authorities warned that efforts to 
build democracy were in jeopardy after east germans gripped by new 
revolutionary fervor stormed the headquarters of the despised 
secret police and ransacked it hundreds of thousands of other 
protesters took to the streets monday night across the country 
expressing anger at communist leaders for not moving faster to 
dismantle the secret police and implement reforms 
they demanded the ouster of the communists three months after a 
peaceful popular revolt toppled old hardline communist leaders 
the party still essentially controls the government media economy 
and bureaucracy 
in the southern city of cottbus several dozen protesters pelted 
the local secret police building with rocks and clashed with guards 
in an unsuccessful attempt to storm it news reports said 
the communistled caretaker government feeling the greatest 
pressure in weeks said the storming of the secret police 
headquarters in east berlin posed the gravest danger to efforts 
to establish true democracy 
communist premier hans modrow rushed to the building and 
through a loudspeaker pleaded with the protesters to stop 
he appealed for the demonstrators to stay in a dialogue with 
his shaky governing coalition alternately facing angry 
interruptions and applause modrow also professed full 
understanding of the rage stemming from decades of repression at 
the hands of the secret police 
the protesters shouted we are the people we are the people 
as they rushed into the secret police building monday afternoon 
they scattered documents and looted wine food and clothing from 
storerooms and closets 
they filled stairways with papers ripped out drawers from 
offices and broke windows several ripped down a picture of 
communist leader erich honecker who was ousted in october and 
trampled it 
about 60 police on hand at the time did not try to stop them 
according to news reports no injuries were reported and many in 
the crowd appeared calm and goodnatured as they milled through the 
headquarters 
reports of the size of the crowd of protesters ranged from tens 
of thousands to 100000 
the protesters dispersed by late evening east german television 
said a citizens committee and regular police officers sealed off 
the building after the protest 
the police agency is being dismantled and it was not clear how 
many people were working at the headquarters monday 
earlier monday modrow offered opposition groups a far greater 
say in running the caretaker government before free elections set 
for may 6 
however the protests appear to be reaching further into 
virtually all parts of society and age groups increasingly 
children and elderly people are taking to the streets with other 
protesters 
the new forum opposition group had called mondays protests to 
challenge how the caretaker government is running the country 
after the storming of secret police headquarters staterun 
television interrupted its programs several times to broadcast a 
warning against further violence 
the democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest 
danger said the warning the statement called for calm and 
reason saying the protest had gotten out of control 
the rev rainer eppelmann an opposition leader said he 
regretted the violence but said the government should take the 
attack as an alarm signal and fulfill its pledge to abolish the 
secret police 
government officials at talks with the opposition monday morning 
described the strength of the secret police and the weaponry 
controlled by the agency including rifles rocketpropelled 
grenades and machine guns 
televised reports on the meeting including the announcement 
that the security apparatus had accounted for more than 1 percent 
of the national budget may have set off the attack in east berlin 
negotiators at the talks voted to force egon krenz who was 
ousted as communist party chief on dec 3 after six weeks in 
office to appear and answer questions about the party ties to the 
secret police 
also monday tens of thousands of workers walked off their jobs 
in several cities including east berlin to demand an end to 
communist power and complete abolition of the secret police 
official news media also reported that a total of about 500000 
people demonstrated against the communists and secret police in at 
least a dozen other cities on monday evening 
about 150000 people mounted a noisy protest against the 
communists in the opposition hotbed of leipzig they also chanted 
slogans in favor of german unification and waved dozens of west 
german flags 
in cottbus about 50 people broke away from the main group of 
several thousand and clashed with police guarding the secret police 
headquarters there the official adn news agency said 
the protesters threw stones and broke windows in an effort to 
storm the building but police forced them back the agency said 
earlier monday chief national prosecutor hansjuergen joseph 
announced that he plans indictments for high treason against 
honecker and the ousted leaders former secret police chief erich 
mielke 
the charge could result in a death sentence

one of every 80 east germans worked or 
informed for the secret police and 3200 employees did nothing but 
tap telephones and open mail according to the official assigned to 
dismantle the dreaded agency 
manfred sauer said the huge state security apparatus cost 36 
billion marks last year the equivalent of 2 billion at the 
official rate of the time 
that was 13 percent of the entire national budget sauer told 
the seventh weekly negotiating session between the communists and 
opposition on monday he spoke just hours before tens of thousands 
of people ransacked security police headquarters in east berlin 
sauer said erich honecker the hardline leader ousted in 
october expanded the agency dramatically after gaining power in 
1971 
by the end of the 1980s there were 85000 agents and 109000 
regular informants in a nation of 163 million people sauer said 
he added that besides the 3200 agents assigned to telephones and 
mail 5000 were engaged in other forms of direct spying on 
citizens 
his disclosures were the most comprehensive yet about the 
workings of the secret police 
all information was stored in computers he said and the aim of 
the honecker regime was total comprehensive surveillance to 
frustrate dissent 
honecker built a disproportionately large surveillance 
system and tried to solve political problems with methods of 
penal law sauer said 
domestic spying has ceased and all directives against 
dissidents were stopped by the government on nov 29 sauer 
told the meeting he said 30000 agents had been fired new jobs 
were being sought for 22500 more and the rapid dismissal of 
another 20000 within the shortest time possible was being 
arranged 
those remaining would be needed to supervise the dissolution of 
the agency sauer said 
the interior ministry has set jan 25 as the deadline for 
retrieving all weapons from former secret police agents including 
124000 pistols 76000 submachine guns about 3500 
grenadelaunchers and and 342 antiaircraft guns 
east german officials say the country faces an increasing threat 
from neonazis which many in the opposition see as an attempt to 
justify keeping the secret police or replacing them with a similar 
organization 
interior minister lothar ahrendt read a report at mondays 
meeting that said neofascist antisemitic and antiforeigner 
dangers exist throughout the country

transplants are proving to be a successful 
treatment for babies born with a deadly heart defect according to 
the first detailed study of such operations 
the report being published next month shows that 23 of 28 
heart recipients continued to do well several years after receiving 
the transplants as infants said dr welton gersony of columbia 
university in new york 
the operations were performed by dr leonard bailey of loma 
linda university medical center in california who gained fame by 
transplanting a baboon heart into the tiny patient known as baby 
fae 
gersony predicted monday that baileys report would convince 
many surgeons of the value of infant heart transplants and that 
the use of the transplants would spread rapidly across the country 
the infants who underwent the transplants were born without the 
left side of the heart the condition known as hypoplastic left 
heart syndrome occurs in one of 3000 to 5000 american babies 
gersony said 
the only alternative to a transplant is a procedure called the 
norwood operation which offers only about a 30 to 40percent 
chance of survival past two years gersony said 
without an operation death usually occurs within weeks 
gersony said baileys report also demonstrates that it is 
possible to simplify the process of obtaining donor infant hearts 
for transplant 
bailey had thought it was necessary to bring the donor babies to 
loma linda and remove their hearts there he has now shown it is 
possible to remove the heart and ship it separately as is done 
with adult donor hearts 
donor hearts often come from infants born with fatal nervous 
system defects gersony said 
increased attention to infant heart transplants has enlarged the 
supply of donor hearts according to a report at an american heart 
association meeting in november 
in two years we havent lost a child on the waiting list for 
a donor heart said one of baileys loma linda colleagues dr 
steven gundry 
at that meeting gundry reported on 17 infants given heart 
transplants because of other severe heart defects only one of them 
died of pneumonia the others had normal heart functions up to 
four years after surgery gundry reported 
gersony said baileys forthcoming report suggests that the 
immaturity of infants immune systems makes them less likely than 
adults to reject transplanted hearts

the chairman of the democratic national 
committee says blacks and jews must take care to keep their 
political bonds intact despite differences over various issues 
differences that can anger and even enrage cannot be allowed 
to divide us ron brown told an observance monday at the israeli 
embassy of martin luther kings birthday we must realize that 
the differences between our communities are not recognized by david 
duke and the ku klux klan that race hatred and religious 
persecution walk handinhand he said 
duke is a former klan leader serving in the louisiana 
legislature he has ties to neonazi groups and is president of the 
national association for the advancement of white people 
brown the first black to be elected to the democratic partys 
chairmanship was the featured speaker at the fifth commemorative 
observance held at the embassy 
he said that just as king took his message outside his church 
and into the streets we must leave behind this gathering of 
elites and carry a message to those in our communities who are not 
here the poor and disaffected the uneducated the prejudiced and 
the angry people who search for targets and scapegoats 
that message is this it is not jews that have bombed and 
threatened civil rights leaders and it is not blacks who are 
painting swastikas on synagogues brown said we do not 
threaten one another

the tokyo stock exchanges key index followed up 
its worst singleday drop in more than two years with a slightly 
larger plunge today while the dollar edged up against the japanese 
yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average fell 66641 points or 18 
percent closing at 3685036 its lowest level since the 3688153 
closing nov 27 
the market was closed monday for a national holiday on friday 
the nikkei lost 65636 points then its worst oneday plunge since 
73191 on nov 19 1987 following a crash on wall street 
so far this year the nikkei has lost nearly 2000 points or 
68 percent 
the market was marred with sell orders all day long said 
ichitaro watanabe a dealer at nikko scurities co it was the 
result of a combination of unfavorable factors hitting the market 
all at once 
with investors dumping issues the index began its dive as soon 
as the market opened today and quickly fell below the 37000point 
level dealers said 
nobody was buying said yoshio shimoyama of nikko 
securities everybody was watching and waiting 
dealers and analysts have said the nikkeis recent fall has 
resulted largely from falling government bond prices caused by the 
weakening yen the yens weakness also has intensified existing 
pessimism in the stock market they said 
but over the weekend the regional conflict worsened in the 
soviet union and the new york market fared poorly overnight 
aggravating the markets pessimism said keiichi nishida a 
dealer at kidder peabody 
dealers said the fall in bond prices is likely to stop soon 
because yields are approaching an appropriate level around 7 
percent but a recovery in stock prices is unlikely before japans 
general elections in february 
right now market players see no encouraging sign to buy 
issues said yoshiro inoue an analyst at nomura securities 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 14575 yen up 040 
yen from fridays close of 14535 yen it opened at 14585 yen and 
ranged between 14565 yen and 14607 yen 
traders attributed the us currencys strength in tokyo to its 
rise against most major foreign currencies monday while the new 
york and tokyo markets were closed for holidays 
the central banks dollarselling intervention kept the dollar 
from rising more steeply said a trader with the bank of tokyo 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
kyodo news service said the bank sold more than 400 million 
the bank does not comment on its exchange market activities 
the bank of tokyo trader said the lower stock and bond prices 
prompted market players to sell yen 
chizuko satsukawa a trader with chemical bank in tokyo said 
the yen will remain weak for the time being 
concerns over the election are prompting market players to get 
rid of the yen which helps the dollar become stronger she said 
but a sharp plunge by the yen is also unlikely while the bank of 
japan is actively selling dollars ms satsukawa said

despite the intense scrutiny given the charles 
stuart case investigators still are not entirely sure of the 
answer to the major remaining question in the twisted drama who 
shot stuart and his wife and how 
police are leaning toward the scenario that stuart who died 
jan 4 in what is believed to be suicide set off when a brother 
implicated him shot his wife and himself last oct 23 but they 
cannot rule out a different gunman 
in a hospital interview several days after the shootings stuart 
told police an assailant entered the back seat of their car at a 
red light forced him to drive to a remote area of the city robbed 
the couple and then shot them 
in a short time police came up with a suspect with a long 
criminal record stuarts deception legal experts say got the 
investigation off on the wrong track by shifting the focus away 
from him and the physical evidence 
its very common that once the police have a suspect who 
satisfies them they will stop looking at other people said 
lawyer alan dershowitz a harvard law school professor they 
dont want the defense later saying that they were looking at other 
people because they had doubts about your case 
it has been determined that three bullets were fired that night 
one hit the roof of stuarts car one hit stuart in the stomach 
and one struck his wife 
an affidavit indicates carol stuart was struck on the left side 
of the head which would seem to rule out a gunman shooting from 
the outside right of the car the possibilities remain that stuart 
could have shot his wife and then himself that another person 
could have shot both of them from the rear or the outside left of 
the car or a combination of the two 
an investigator who would not be identified by name said 
stuarts car was examined by the city crime lab and that the angles 
of the shots appeared consistent with stuarts account 
when asked where the results of that examination might be 
obtained the investigator said i dont know that anything was 
ever put into writing i never saw any paper on it dershowitz 
said investigators have a tendency to avoid producing documents 
that defense attorneys might later poke holes into 
police would not comment when asked if fingerprint and fiber 
checks were made on the car which stuart traded in on a new car 
after he left the hospital in december 
authorities have said stuart was a suspect as are all husbands 
and wives when a spouse is slain but only a remote one because 
they had no reason to doubt him until he was implicated by his 
youngest brother 
in hindsight a question about the shootings might have been 
stirred by a comment stuart made in the very early moments after 
the crime 
in his car phone plea for help stuart was asked if his wife was 
shot he told the police dispatcher yes in the head the 
dispatcher asked in the head stuart responded yes i 
ducked down 
was stuart saying that he avoided being shot because he ducked 
or that his wife was hit because he ducked an almost impossible 
result of a shot fired toward stuart from the back seat 
the investigator indicated stuart was not pressed on the point 
stuart might also have been pressed when according to an 
affidavit he was interviewed in the hospital several days after 
the shootings although stuart could not tell the dispatcher where 
he was the night of the crime until he drove to a major 
thoroughfare in the hospital he was able to steer investigators to 
a street where he said the shots were fired so obscure that it 
cannot be found on at least two detailed city maps 
of witnesses who said the arrested suspect william bennett 
admitted the shooting one has since said he was coerced into 
making those statements and another has said he was coached by 
investigators bennett has been cleared but remained in jail on 
other charges 
john julian a spokesman for the suffolk county district 
attorney who is in charge of the investigation said the office 
stands by its procedures 
meanwhile investigators have turned to charles stuarts 
youngest brother matthew 
matthew has said through his lawyer that charles arranged for 
him to follow charles to a meeting place where charles tossed him 
his wifes bag and a gun and that matthew then left having no 
indication that a shooting had occurred he said the bag and gun 
were thrown in a river in revere 
had charles or someone else already done the shooting that 
would mean stuart had driven to the meeting place and tossed the 
bag while he was suffering from a lifethreatening injury 
the gun believed used in the crime was pulled from the river 
last week and is being analyzed by the fbi crime lab 
a grand jury has taken a recess in the case one prosecutor has 
said the panel might not indict anyone and that no one may ever 
know what happened 
just about anythings still possible he said

tourists who ignore warnings not to feed 
the wildlife are doing so at increasing risk at yellowstone 
national park where some animals have begun to bite the hand that 
feeds them 
while rangers do not have specific figures showing an increase 
in animal attacks they have noticed that in recent years more and 
more coyotes bighorn sheep and other animals have learned to 
associate man with food because of the handouts tourists offer 
i was riding a snow machine two winters ago i guess toward 
old faithful and there was a coyote in the road and we stopped and 
the guy with me wanted a photograph of it recalled ranger norm 
bishop he pulled his camera out and i started to pull mine out 
the instant i touched that bag the coyote was almost in my lap 
he instantly associated the sound of that plastic bag with 
potato chips fritos hamburger whatever he was ready for it 
said bishop it was really unsettling to me i didnt like an 
animal that close to me eager to have what i had 
skirmishes between humans and animals can be fatal in recent 
years a french tourist was fatally gored by a bison and a montana 
photographer was killed by a grizzly bear he was hoping to 
photograph last year a black bear who repeatedly forced hikers up 
trees and ravaged their backpacks for food was killed by rangers 
a recent coyote attack on a crosscountry skier likely was 
simply a case of the skier surprising the animal park officials 
believe 
we know that grizzly bears occasionally black bears and 
mountain lions and coyotes are all dangerous to people bishop 
said 
but in most cases not all but in most what we see is that 
the animals particularly the bears that actually killed someone 
were bears that were habituated by people feeding them 
part of the problem according to park spokeswoman marsha karle 
is the growing number visitors to yellowstone which reported a 
record 29 million last summer 
we cant have rangers behind every tree she said 
and the animals have grown somewhat lenient to man bishop said 
most of the time the animals are so darn cooperative theyre 
just doing their own thing he said we have elk here in 
mammoth that you can walk within 10 feet of them some of them 
dont get up some dont even look up 
the animals are basically saying hey all we want to do is 
stand here and eat you guys as long as you dont approach us and 
show signs of harming us youre ok with us he said the 
laissez faire arrangement works great as long as people dont get 
within the personal space of the animal but you get within 
that space of that animal theyre like us if you crowd me 
aggressively im going to push 
when the bison has the pushing equipment that hes got i 
dont want to be pushed said bishop 
visitors are inundated with literature about yellowstones 
wildlife when they enter the park officials said 
we have just tried really hard to educate people gently and 
in a forthright manner to say look the animals are big theyre 
strong theyre fast theyre capable of doing you fatal harm 
bishop said 
so respect them keep your distance act predictably except 
in really rare circumstances youll stay out of trouble

sixteen men mostly boat captains and 
truck drivers have been acquitted in what authorities said was a 
marijuana smuggling ring with links to deposed panamanian dictator 
manuel antonio noriega 
four of the 20 codefendants were convicted monday on the fifth 
day of deliberations in the 2month trial 
i think the entire trial was a defeat for the prosecution 
said rick michot a defense attorney 
the defendants had been charged with conspiracy importation and 
distribution federal prosecutors said the defendants smuggled 
48000 pounds of marijuana into north carolina in 1982 and 280000 
pounds into louisiana in 1983 
they planned to smuggle 1 million pounds into missouri in 1984 
prosecutors said but were foiled by the arrest of ringleader 
stephen michael kalish kalish testified as the star prosecution 
witness that what he called the master blaster load was to 
arrive a few days before he was arrested 
assistant us attorney judith lombardino the chief prosecutor 
refused to comment after the verdicts saying a related trial of 25 
people is coming up 
the cases resulted from the same investigation that led to 
noriegas 1988 indictment in tampa fla on drug charges 
kalish testified that he once gave noriega a 300000 
present for helping arrange a panamanian banking network to 
launder drug profits he said the network he set up with noriega 
laundered 50 million to 100 million a month for the medellin 
cocaine cartel of colombia 
one juror rowdy lege 30 said some members of the panel 
voiced concern over noriegas involvement and the possibility 
of retaliation by drug lords 
convicted on 16 counts were jerry hughey of austin texas jim 
swope also of texas and max wade no hometown available they 
could be sentenced to 170 years in prison steve ellender of houma 
la was found guilty on six conspiracy counts and innocent on 
seven others he could be sentenced to 30 years 
us district judge john shaw postponed sentencing until after a 
background check of the four 
patricia thomas ellenders attorney said she will appeal on 
grounds of an inconsistent verdict 
some of the defendants who were acquitted said it was a 
bittersweet victory 
i feel kind of used said phillip watkins win or lose 
weve already lost 
clark nash of missouri said hes broke and doesnt know what to 
do 
everything ive worked for for 30 years went to my lawyer 
he said 
kalish who said his drugsmuggling organization operated from 
the late 1970s through 1984 is currently in prison he pleaded 
guilty in tampa in 1987 to a charge of continuing criminal 
enterprise 
in november jay foreman a pilot who said he flew a private 
airplane for kalish testified that noriega was a passenger aboard 
the plane several times 
originally 187 people were accused in the case but many 
pleabargained or were culled for separate trials the judge 
acquitted three before the defense opened 
officials say about 90 of those indicted remain fugitives 
the conspiracy centered on the smuggled marijuana the other 
charges dealt with aiding and abetting the importation and 
distribution 
hughey swope and wade were convicted on all those counts plus 
three each of wire fraud interstate commerce and the illegal 
distribution of funds from the conspiracy 
in the next trial for feb 12 19 of the defendants are accused 
of higherlevel involvement in the ring among them is harold 
doc mcghee manager of the rock groups bon jovi skid row and 
the scorpions 
kalish identified mcghee as the link between the smuggler and a 
colombian drug supplier mcghee was given a suspended sentence 
after pleading guilty to importing marijuana in north carolina

groundwater pumping by the antelope 
valleys growing population is cracking and sinking the dry lakebed 
runways famed as landing strips for space shuttles and test pilots 
during a california water commission hearing here last week air 
force officials said the floor of rogers dry lake has subsided 3 
feet in some places and is broken by fissures up to 3 feet wide 2 
feet deep and hundreds of feet long 
the air force has been able to keep using the clay runways only 
by filling in the cracks 
were seeing severe cracks throughout the whole lakebed 
said col peter walsh civil engineer for the mojave desert 
military base 
many space shuttles have landed on dry lakebed runways although 
columbia was scheduled to touch down on a concrete landing strip on 
friday 
the us geological survey is conducting a 6 million fiveyear 
study of the problem and other wateruse issues for the air force 
its very obvious groundwater pumpage is having an impact on 
the subsidence at edwards air force base said john klein 
district chief of the surveys water resources division 
klein said the sinking and related drinkingwater shortages at 
edwards will continue unless major steps are taken to limit 
further withdrawals of ground water 
water use has climbed during the past decade as the population 
of the antelope valley which includes lancaster and palmdale 
doubled to almost 200000 air force officials are urging local 
water agencies to use less ground water and use more water brought 
from the north via the california aqueduct 
the water table at edwards dropped from about 10 feet below the 
surface in 1948 to a recent level of 100 feet underground klein 
said adding it is difficult to determine how much of the drop is 
caused by population growth 
edwards is 300000 acres the secondlargest air force base in 
the continental united states it is home to the famed flight test 
center whose pilots were glorified in tom wolfes book the right 
stuff

a batch of spring water that smelled 
like kerosene was recalled from stores in six states after a woman 
who drank some of it was hospitalized 
pocono pure mountain spring water recalled 7000 onegallon 
bottles from pathmark and shoprite supermarkets in delaware 
pennsylvania new jersey connecticut new york and massachusetts

numbers 2658200050 and expiration dates of dec 26 1991 and jan 
4 1992 
carl j petro president of pocono artesian waters co of mount 
pocono pa said he suspected the problems were with the 
containers and not with the water he said water bottled the same 
day as the recalled bottles but put in different containers was 
not tainted 
the company has sent samples of the water and containers to an 
independent laboratory for tests petro said 
petro said the tainted water has a petroleum odor to it it 
smells more like kerosene 
the bottles were recalled after delaware state police learned 
that jettie quigley 38 of chadds ford pa became ill sunday 
after drinking water she purchased at a pathmark store in 
wilmington 
quigley who complained of chest pains was in satisfactory 
condition monday at riddle memorial hosptial in lima pa 
petro said that about 10 months ago the company had a problem 
with 4000 bottles of water in similar containers the water 
however was sampled before it was delivered to grocery stores a 
company investigation did not reveal the source of the smell petro 
said 
he refused to identify the manufacturer of the container 
in both cases employee tampering has been ruled out he said

the antagonism between armenians and azerbaijanis 
that has led to deadly clashes in the soviet caucasus has deep 
historical roots and religious and ethnic overtones 
armenians claim that after the soviet takeover in azerbaijan 
the republic was given large chunks of territory like 
nagornokarabakh and nakhichevan that was historically part of 
armenia with majority armenian populations 
they blame josef stalin a native of the caucasus who was the 
top soviet official for nationality problems before becoming 
communist party leader and dictator 
under azerbaijani rule armenians assert nakhichevan has been 
virtually rid of its armenian population in nagornokarabakh 
which is still predominantly armenian the local population was 
long deprived of basic services and cultural activities like 
armenianlanguage television and radio broadcasts armenians say 
for their part azerbaijanis note the 1977 soviet constitution 
gives them control over nagornokarabakh and that the socalled 
autonomous region cannot join armenia without azerbaijani consent 
without shusha azerbaijan has no soul an azerbaijani 
saying goes referring to a town in nagornokarabakh that 
historically has been populated by azerbaijanis 
most azerbaijanis a turkic people are shiite moslems most 
armenians christian 
in 1915 an estimated 15 million armenians perished at the 
hands of ottoman turks many armenians today refer to azerbaijanis 
simply as turks showing they do not distinguish between their 
soviet neighbors and the authors of the genocide against their 
people threequarters of a century ago

all 16 people aboard a commuter plane survived 
after it struck a mountaintop during a snowstorm and plunged down a 
hillside in a crash landing some passengers called a miracle 
we started bumping up and down and i didnt know where we were 
or what was happening said nicole blohm a 20yearold 
passenger apparently we were sliding down the mountain at that 
time i knew we had crashed i was thinking this is it 
mondays crash of the skywest turboprop in northeast nevada was 
one of three airline mishaps in two days 
a boeing 747 jetliner carrying 257 people lost power for five 
minutes over the pacific ocean on sunday but the philippine 
airlines pilots restarted the engines and landed safely in 
honolulu the company said 
in colorado on monday a fire broke out in an engine of an aspen 
airways plane shortly after takeoff but the plane returned safely 
to the grand junction airport for an emergency landing officials 
said none of the 26 passengers was injured 
in nevada most of the passengers walked away from the crash 
after the plane flight 5855 went down four miles west of the 
airport in elko the plane was bound for reno from salt lake city 
via elko a town of 8800 
four people were admitted to elko general hospital in fair 
condition and 12 others were treated and released according to a 
nursing supervisor 
the captain who suffered a broken leg and at least two broken 
ribs was the most seriously injured the hospital said 
i think it is a miracle none of us died said 18yearold 
kristina blohm nicoles sister 
the yearold metro iii twinengine plane carrying 14 passengers 
and two crewmembers crashed when the pilot was attempting an 
instrument landing during the snowstorm 
helicopter pilot ted mcbride who spotted the wreckage said the 
plane apparently clipped the top of a 6463foot mountain 
the plane then became airborne briefly before skidding about a 
quarter of a mile down the steep slope mcbride said the crash 
probably would have been more serious had the plane slammed into 
level terrain instead of losing velocity as it skittered down the 
snowy treeless slope 
no one aboard was thrown from the plane and its fuselage was 
intact on the mountain rescuer pete schory said 
right now im feeling that the outcome is wonderful said 
skywest president jerry atkin the thing you hope for in these 
situations is for all survivors its certainly unpleasant to have 
such a thing happen but im very pleased with the outcome 
there was no immediate indication of what caused the crash 
atkin said from st george utah where the airline is based but 
he said the plane was 500 feet lower than the pilot believed 
skywest serves 44 cities in eight western states nevada 
wyoming montana idaho colorado utah arizona and california it 
has 500 flights a day and serves more than a million passengers a 
year 
in colorado an engine on a convair 580 propjet caught fire 
about five minutes after takeoff from grand junction for denver 
authorities said 
officials said the pilot cut the engine and the plane landed 
under power from the remaining engine the fire was out when the 
plane landed witnesses said 
the folks who were getting off the plane had smiles on their 
faces and i was surprised said jeff wendland a spokesman for 
walker field airport i expected to see a lot of white faces 
there was no immediate comment from the denverbased airline 
in hawaii the jumbo jet was 135 miles from honolulu and about 
to start its descent from 37000 feet when its four engines went 
dead according to enrique santos airline vice president for 
communications 
the pilot capt eduardo reyes jr proceeded with the descent 
and power was restored in all engines at 25500 feet santos said 
he added that the flight proceeded normally and landed in honolulu 
without further incident 
the aircraft has been grounded at honolulu pending examination 
by the federal aviation administration and the airline

a lawyer for manuel noriega said the defense team 
will push for the deposed dictators release on bond since the 
government has opened a pandoras box by requesting a detention 
hearing 
i dont think the government will be able to establish the 
facts necessary for the court to pretrial detain our client without 
any bond attorney steven kollin said monday hes presumed to 
be innocent hes entitled to a bond 
that is our system of jurisprudence and we feel that under 
these circumstances that should be the ruling 
noriegas lawyers initially did not ask for a bond hearing in 
his drug trafficking trial in part because they questioned the 
jurisdiction of the court kollin said 
kollin and his cocounsel have said they probably will file 
pretrial motions claiming noriega is a head of state and immune 
from prosecution 
but kollin says the governments action which led to the 
scheduling of a detention hearing jan 26 has put us in a 
posture that we would have to deal with that issue of detention 
and we feel we will be successful 
noriega reportedly has been held in a basement apartment in the 
miami federal courthouse since arriving in the united states jan 4 
a february 1988 us indictment accuses the ousted general of 
taking 46 million in bribes from colombias medellin cartel to 
turn his nation into a way station for cocaine traffic 
he could be imprisoned up to 145 years in prison and fined as 
much as 11 million if convicted 
on friday a federal magistrate set a 1 million bail for one of 
noriegas codefendants daniel miranda but that ruling was 
immediately appealed by prosecutors blocking mirandas release 
miranda charged in the same 1988 indictment is accused of 
flying 800000 in laundered drug money from fort lauderdale to 
panama

carbon monoxide fumes from a 
furnace killed a woman and four youngsters including three of her 
children who were found dead in their new house authorities said 
city inspectors had deemed the furnace unsafe in september and 
ordered it shut off after fumes from it felled at least one person 
then living in the house but a city official said it was unclear 
whether the problem ever was fixed 
the victims moved into the onestory twobedroom home a week 
ago today unpacked moving boxes were scattered throughout the 
house when the bodies were found police lt rich resling said 
monday 
the victims died wednesday evening from carbon monoxide 
poisoning said el paso countys deputy coroner michael stewart 
they were identified as sophia gerardo 34 her sons daniel 
gerardo 9 nash gerardo 11 and mario ortiz 13 and her nephew 
mark mcpeak 15 
carbon monoxide instead of carbon dioxide can be produced when a 
heater fails to burn fuel adequately stewart said 
stewart said the woman may have been aware that something was 
wrong because she apparently tried to pull herself upright by 
grabbing a plant stand which was found toppled next to her 
it looked like she was trying to get out stewart said 
the body of mcpeak was found in the bathroom where he probably 
went after feeling nauseated stewart said the other children were 
found in bed and probably died in their sleep he said 
resling said a neighbor alerted police sunday after peering into 
a window and seeing a body an officer became ill from fumes while 
examining the house resling said 
in about two minutes he would have passed out resling 
said he was lucky to get out of there 
city utilities department inspectors measured the carbon 
monoxide level in the house sunday at 800 parts per million twice 
the lethal level 
city spokesman john henry said that on sept 9 a previous 
occupant of the house was overcome by carbon monoxide and taken to 
a hospital and that inspectors that day redtagged the furnace 
as unsafe 
henry could not say whether the furnace had since been repaired 
because the city does not perform followup inspections 
former tenant brenda hogsett said in an interview published in 
todays colorado springs gazette telegraph two people were sickened 
in the september incident and the buildings 75yearold owner 
darrell atkinson was aware of it she did not know if the furnace 
had been fixed 
atkinson who was distraught over the deaths declined to 
comment the newspaper said 
dallas lopez a friend of the dead woman said he also was aware 
of the past problems with the furnace they had all kinds of city 
workers and the fire department looking around he said adding 
that they later said they fixed the problem 
resling said police were continuing an investigation

the chief prosecutor says leading 
figures from the deposed ceausescu regime are going on trial this 
week on charges ranging from complicity to commit genocide to 
undermining the national economy 
the comments monday from prosecutorgeneral gheorghe robu 
represented the first time the revolutionary government has 
outlined the charges against people who were once among romanias 
most powerful officials 
he was quoted by the official rompres news agency as saying 
pretrial investigations and the taking of depositions had been 
hindered because many of the exofficials can hardly write even 
though a good part of them held a doctorate in science 
critics have complained that the new government is not moving 
fast enough against highranking officials of the ousted regime of 
executed communist dictator nicolae ceaucescu 
robu said that nicu ceausescu the most notorious of ceausescus 
children would be among those tried this week 
as local communist party chief in the transylvanian city of 
sibiu nicu reportedly ordered members of the securitate special 
police to open fire on demonstrators during the revolution that 
toppled ceausescu last month 
nicus sister zoiaelena and brother valentin have also been 
arrested valentin who was a member of the communist partys 
policysetting central committee is also to go on trial this week 
with other ceaucescu associates and members of the special police 
among other defendants to be tried this week according to 
romanian television are former interior minister tudor postlenicu 
and former communist party secretary emil bobu 
the countrys new leaders the national salvation front council 
have not said exactly when or where the trials would take place 
but rompres told the associated press that trials for special 
police members would be held friday in the western city of 
timisoara where the revolt began dec 17 when security forces 
massacred antigovernment protesters 
officials had earlier said the trials would begin monday and 
there was no explanation for the change 
the genocide charge refers to victims of ceausescus 24year 
reign of terror as well as the thousands of romanians killed by the 
special securitate police during the revolution 
the charge of undermining the economy stems from the havoc 
wreaked by ceausescus policy of exporting food and fuel to pay off 
romanias foreign debt of more than 10 billion between 1982 and 
last year 
also monday the government announced an amnesty for crimes 
committed before the revolution however it excluded former 
ceausescu functionaries murderers rapists and terrorists the 
term now applied to securitate members 
the issues of whether to ban the party and capital punishment 
will be submitted to a popular referendum on jan 28 capital 
punishment was outlawed after the ceaucescu executions 
at a news conference monday government spokesman dragos 
munteanu also defended dimitri mazilu vice president of the 
provisional government against charges that he had once been 
connected with the securitate and should therefore be ousted 
rompres said 
even if mazilu was a securitate officer at the beginning of the 
ceausescu regime munteanu said for the last five years he has 
been an outstanding spokesman against ceausescus regime

thousands of mongolians rallied for reform in the 
third street demonstration in their communist countrys capital in 
the past month a foreign source said today 
the source said the demonstrators led by the newly formed 
mongolian democratic union criticized former leader yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal and mongolias communist party politiburo 
the protesters who numbered up to 5000 were peaceful and 
goodhumored and police made no attempt to interfere the 
source said the temperature was about 4 degrees below zero during 
the gathering sunday on the steps of a movie theater in ulan bator 
the democratic union a group thought to be made up of 
reformminded intellectuals and artists also led openair rallies 
on two sundays in december those demonstrations drew far fewer 
people with crowds estimated at several hundred to 1000 
the group reportedly has adopted a draft charter and petitioned 
the nations parliament for official status 
the source said demonstrators at todays protest carried banners 
calling for tsedenbal to be put on trial and urging a faster pace 
of perestroika or reforms like those championed by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
tsedenbal purged in 1984 after more than three decades in 
power has been criticized by the current government for his forced 
collectivization policies and his bureaucratic centralism 
mongolia a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast 
deserts and grasslands of eastern asia has cautiously followed the 
reform policies taken by its protector state the soviet union 
however the government has said the pace of reform has been too 
slow and members of parliament have called for fundamental changes 
in price and wage systems in the statecontrolled economy 
the source said it was not clear whether political upheaval in 
east europe was influencing events in distant mongolia and it was 
probably wrong to rush toward expectations of dramatic changes 
in the country 
other sources agreed that while the momentum for reform was 
picking up advocates of change appeared willing to work within the 
system and not directly confront the ruling party 
the government had no official reaction to the protest

the leader of albania accused the western 
news media of concocting false reports of unrest in his country and 
rejected the democratic reform gripping the rest of eastern europe 
communist party chief ramiz alia said in a speech monday to 
factory workers in tirana the albanian capital that the reports 
of upheaval were lies and falsity his remarks were distributed 
by the official news agency ata 
recently in continuation of the events that occurred in the 
countries of the east the fantasy regarding albania has been 
diversified such a fantasy is reflected in some organs of the 
western press alia said 
the tide of reform elsewhere in eastern europe has left albania 
as europes last bastion of stalinism 
referring to a report by the yugoslav news agency tanjug that 
special measures in albania resembled a state of emergency alia 
told the workers 
with such filthy things does the yugoslav news agency nourish 
world public opinion 
we say that a state of emergency demonstrations unrest 
and killings are found nowhere in albania 
accounts in the western media have told of gunfire and possibly 
deaths in some albanian cities 
foto cami a member of the ruling party politburo said on state 
radio and television friday the reports of unrest were slanders 
and antialbanian inventions 
on saturday ata quoted a man it identified as paolo de nicola 
an italian diplomat as calling the reports groundless 
alia said monday we are sure the antialbanian campaign 
will end like a soap bubble because it is based completely on 
lies and falsity 
our people have chosen their own way of development and only 
they and no one else know and decide on what should be done and 
what steps should be taken what changes are demanded by time and 
the process of socialist development and how they should be 
achieved 
albania is an isolated country of 3 million million people

an environmental group today criticized the 
continued reliance by industry on three widely used 
ozonedestroying chemicals saying that while some companies are 
cutting back on their use others are relying on them even more 
the natural resources defense council produced industry figures 
showing more than 200 million pounds of the chemicals were released 
into the atmosphere by more than 3000 companies in 1987 the last 
year for which complete figures were available 
partial figures for 1988 show continued heavy use of the 
chemicals with the vast majority of companies yet to take any 
concrete steps to phase them out said david doniger a lawyer 
for the nrdc their delays threaten the health and safety of all 
americans 
the subject of the nrdc study are two chemicals widely used as 
metalcleaning solvents methyl chloroform and cfc113 in the 
aerospace computer and electronics industries the third chemical 
is carbon tetrachloride which is primarily used in the united 
states for manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
the three chemicals are among those that when released can drift 
high into the atmosphere where the chlorine component reacts with 
the earths protective ozone layer causing destruction of the 
ozone the three chemicals currently account for 37 percent of the 
chlorine attacking the atmospheric ozone layer the nrdc said 
the government and industry have acknowleged that the cfcs 
including cfc113 used as a solvent and carbon tetrachloride should 
be phased out international treaty calls for a phaseout of cfcs 
and as that occurs the use of carbon tetrachloride also will 
decline 
but methyl chloroform whose potency for ozone destruction is 
less than 15 percent that of cfcs remains unregulated and is 
viewed by much of industry as a potential bridge chemical as 
companies stop using cfcs as a cleaning solvent 
its needed for the orderly phaseout of cfcs maintained 
carol niemi an environmental specialist at dow chemical co which 
makes about half of the methyl chloroform produced today 
nevertheless she said in a telephone interview industry 
studies indicate that use of methyl chloroform although likely to 
increase in the next few years is expected to decline over the 
next decade 
environmentalists argue that industry reliance on any of the 
three ozonedamaging chemicals should be reduced more quickly 
decisions made in the boardrooms of these companies using the 
chemicals will determine whether we succeed or fail in preventing 
the first truly global environmental catastrophe said the nrdcs 
doniger 
using 1987 industry figures provided to the environmental 
protection agency and 1988 information gathered from a scattering 
of companies through an nrdc questionnaire the environmental group 
sought to determine to what extent companies are continuing to use 
the chemicals 
comparisons could be made based only on a relatively small 
number of companies because many of the 3014 plans that reported 
1987 releases to the epa did not respond to the nrdc questionaire 
according to the comparison however 194 companies increased 
their use of the chemicals between 1987 and 1988 although in some 
cases companies appeared to be substituting methyl chloroform for 
the more environmentally damaging cfc113s 
however according to the nrdc figures 223 companies reported a 
declining use of the chemicals including some cases in which the 
cut in emissions was substantial 
in the case of methyl chloride pratt amp whitney the connecticut 
aircraft engine manufacturer that was the biggest user of the 
chemical in 1987 with 19 million pounds reported emissions of 
only 421000 pounds in 1988 
the nrdc said 112 companies reported methyl chloroform emission 
increases of 2000 pounds or more in 1988 while 144 companies 
reported emission reductions 15 companies reported having stopped 
using methyl chloroform and two other sources said they were 
committed to specific phaseout dates 
although cfc113 is one of the chemicals whose use is expected to 
be discontinued 75 companies reported emission increases from 1987 
to 1988 while 76 reported emissions decreases and five companies 
reported having stopped using the chemical 
seven companies reported increaes in carbon tetrachloride 
emissions between 1987 and 1988 while 12 companies reported 
emission decreases hercules inc the no 1 user of the chemical 
in 1987 reported it had stopped using it last august the nrdc 
said

there was something revealing the other day in 
president bushs display of ire on television about television 
he complained that television misleadingly had caused him to 
appear callously indifferent to the fate of the us servicemen he 
had sent to panama 
he had held a news conference on dec 21 the day after the 
invasion all was going well congress and public opinion were 
rallying behind him and a day after dispatching troops he felt 
able to announce this operation is not over but its pretty 
well wrapped up 
he was upbeat laughing engaging in banter with reporters 
please sarah lighten up he told one reporter and to 
another who asked why the government had put a 1 million bounty 
on the head of gen manuel antonio noriega his picture will be 
in every post office in town 
what bush did not know was that while he was making my 
frivolous remarks his words for it some of the networks had 
gone to a splitscreen technique to report simultaneously on the 
arrival at dover air force base in delaware of the bodies of the 
first four us servicemen killed in panama 
so while bush joshed the viewers saw conflicting images a 
happygolucky president in one corner of the screen and 
flagdraped coffins in another 
i could understand why the viewers were concerned about 
this bush said at his next news conference they thought their 
president at a solemn moment like that didnt give a damn 
bush said if the networks would tell him the next time he was 
competing against a compelling news story he would gladly step 
aside and let the other story have the entire screen 
the networks which had carried the splitscreen stories 
disagreed over whether they had mistreated the president 
cbs and cnn said they were doing no more than covering the news 
as the news occurred nbc chose not to go with the splitscreen 
picture abc carried it but anchorman peter jennings apologized 
saying the president could not have known of the simultaneous 
broadcast and the pictures from delaware could have waited 
but the networks rejected bushs request that they inform him in 
advance of what they will do in a similar situation to do 
otherwise would have surrendered their editorial freedom and made 
them part of the white houses press apparatus 
this sort of thing wouldnt have happened on michael deavers 
watch oldtimers murmured deaver was the presidential aide who 
devoted much of his adult lifetime to protecting ronald reagans 
image no detail was too small when it came to policing what kind 
of impression reagan would make 
deaver would have known that the bodies were arriving perhaps 
there would have been a quick trip to dover a presidential salute 
a solemn sentence or two in any event no joking president on 
television 
the bush white house is imageconscious witness the 
presidents anguished cry but not as dedicated to image control 
television people who know when they are being manipulated even 
if they cant do much about it like to believe that television if 
it watches long enough ultimately and invariably captures 
someones true character you cant fool the cameras long enough 
thats their fervid belief 
television made joe mccarthy and television destroyed him 
says sig mickelson former president of cbs news now teaching at 
san diego state university in california 
if a person is on tv long enough the truth about him will 
out says lawrence lichty a longtime student of television and 
chairman of northwestern universitys department of radio 
television and film 
the bush who america has come to know on television in the first 
year of his presidency is closer to the genuine article than roger 
ailes madefortv bush who got elected that twofisted 
tabascospiced pork rindeating flagsaluter who ran for the 
office 
if occasional giddiness is part of the picture thats bush too 
and according to the lichty theory hes bound to show it

1976 and possibly come to new york next fall powers said 
critics in washington lambasted annie 2 after its jan 4 
opening at the kennedy centers opera house 
annie was a musical to take to your heart wrote david 
richards in the washington post but youll want to take a paddle 
to annie 2 he called the book preposterous and the score 
dull 
revisions were started immediately by charnin he cut the book 
and musical numbers for the show which ran three hours and 20 
minutes during its first preview many theatergoers complained that 
there werent enough orphans in the show and five little girls 
were added to the cast 
mike nichols larry gelbart and tommy tune all of them 
experienced show doctors reportedly were asked to come to 
washington to look at the troubled show 
the plot for annie 2 which takes place six weeks after the 
ending of the first show revolves around daddy warbucks search 
for a wife miss hannigan wants the job to get revenge on annie

as annie and loudon added as miss hannigan the production went on 
to open in new york in april 1977 winning the tony as best musical 
and running for 2377 performances

space shuttle columbias five crew 
members labored quietly today on their experiments growing protein 
crystals in zero gravity melting and resolidifying a metal and 
photographing the earth 
all systems aboard columbia are clean mission control 
reported as the astronauts worked through the seventh full day of 
their marathon 10day mission 
there was little radio traffic between ground and space to 
allow the crew to stay on the timeline and get all their various 
chores accomplished without a lot of interference from the folks 
here the control center said 
we just let them go at it and theyve been doing very well 
television from the shuttle showed the astronauts busily 
pursuing the several experiments 
there were no further problems with a navigation system that 
sounded an alarm and wakened the crew sunday night and commander 
dan brandenstein stopped a dehumidifier leak that had been a bother 
almost from the beginning of the flight 
engineers did not have an explanation for the five sensor 
signals that triggered the alarm but some theorized they may have 
been associated with electronics that feed a speedmeasuring 
accelerometer and not with the navigation unit itself 
brandenstein plugged the leak by stuffing a towel in a plastic 
bag and wrapping it around the pipe that was its source 
the astronauts were so busy with their experiments monday that 
they went to bed more than two hours late so mission control let 
them sleep an extra half hour today 
but it told them in the package of messages and instructions 
faxed up this morning your request for overtime has been 
disapproved 
one of the crews first chores was to dump excess water 
overboard through a valve a tv picture showed the expelled water 
turning to ice crystals as it hit the cold atmosphere of space as 
columbia passed into daylight the sun brilliantly illuminated the 
crystal shower 
quite a show isnt it brandenstein remarked 
you bet replied mission control communicator tammy jernigan 
mission specialists bonnie dunbar marsha ivins and david low 
were busy monitoring an experiment in which the metal indium was 
being melted and resolidified to determine if spaceprocessed 
materials can have industrial applications 
they also were growing protein crystals in a continuing series 
of shuttle experiments that could lead to the weightless processing 
of new purer drugs to be used to fight cancer aids high blood 
pressure arthritis and other diseases 
medical experiments were aimed at learning how well the human 
body adapts to weightlessness 
brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee when not minding the ship 
were busy photographing earth features for a documentary film on 
how man and nature are damaging the planet 
among the targets were large fires in kenya and madagascar and 
deforestation in brazil and haiti 
the astronauts accomplished their main goals during the first 
four days of the mission they deployed a navy communications 
satellite and retrieved an 11ton science laboratory that they will 
bring back to earth so scientists can learn how scores of different 
materials and systems survived six years in orbit 
columbia is to land in the darkness at 259 am pst on friday 
at edwards air force base calif

gen colin powell the top us military 
leader today welcomed initial steps by the sovietled warsaw pact 
to reshape its armed forces and said the level of us forces in 
western europe could be changed 
powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff made his 
comments before top brass from the soviet union and 33 other 
countries in an unusual exchange of views on their governments 
military policies 
there is nothing sacrosanct about the number of american 
troops stationed in europe he said there is nothing carved in 
stone that says that military power in a divided europe should 
remain as it has over the last four decades 
we are hopeful that the process in which we are all engaged 
will lead to the day when the military demands on both european 
alliances are greatly diminished he said 
foreign minister alois mock of austria opened the unprecedented 
meeting which is designed to further reduce military tensions in 
europe 
the military doctrine seminar scheduled in october attracted 
greater attention following the wave of democratic reform that 
swept eastern europe 
gen mikhail moiseyev the soviet military chief of staff also 
was scheduled to speak 
the threeweek session marks the first time top military 
officers of the nato and the warsaw pact plus the neutral and 
nonaligned states of europe are sitting down to discuss their 
intentions plans and arsenals us officials say 
the discussions are being held under the auspices of the 
negotiations on confidence and securitybuilding measures 
western military experts are anxious to hear just what the 
emerging democracies in the sovietled warsaw pact have in mind for 
their defense policies 
john maresca who leads the us delegation to the 
confidencebuilding talks said officials want to understand 
better what these eastern european countries are thinking at this 
time how their policies are going to evolve 
czechoslovakia and hungary already have said they want soviet 
troops off their soil this year in east germany communist party 
leader gregor gysi has proposed that all foreign troops leave both 
germanys by 1999 
there is a greater willingness of countries in eastern europe 
to take positions on the basis of what they see as their national 
interest rather than just following a position which is dictated 
to them by the soviet union maresca told a news conference 
monday 
western analysts also are eager to hear what moiseyev has to say 
about the soviet unions military stance 
in december 1988 soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced 
plans to pare his governments defense spending and military 
forces including the pullout of 50000 of the estimated 550000 
troops from eastern europe 
moscow has said it is adopting a more defensive military 
doctrine we would like to understand better what that means 
said maresca 
western analysts seek hard evidence of lower spending fewer 
troops and reduced arms production 
the north atlantic treaty organization the 16nation western 
alliance maintains its forces are the minimum needed to defend 
against an attack 
during the seminar the military officers were expected to 
present their views then respond to questions the giveandtake 
is designed to fill in any gaps or clear up any confusion 
in addition the officers will have a chance to meet privately 
for further questioning 
the idea behind the meeting is to lessen the secrecy that 
surrounds military policies the overall confidencebuilding 
negotiations are aimed at finding ways to increase trust among the 
countries and therefore reduce tensions in europe 
maresca emphasized that the seminar is an experiment no report 
will be made at the end 
john cross deputy director of the international institute for 
strategic studies in london said it cannot but be for the good 
for the senior military officers and thinkers of both sides to be 
talking to one another

threeday rampage and tore down frontier posts watchtowers and 
communication lines they demanded reunification of the soviet and 
iranian azerbaijans 
impatient with official statements that travel restrictions 
between the countries will be eased many soviet moslems have 
jumped into the cold waters of the araks and swum to the iranian 
side for short visits 
tehran radio earlier reported that 30 people swam across on 
sunday 
this weeks peaceful border protests contrasted sharply with 
scenes inside soviet azerbaijan where militant azerbaijanis 
clashed with ethnic armenians over who should govern the disputed 
territory of nagornokarabakh the enclave is a part of azerbaijan 
but its residents mainly are armenian 
moscow on monday sent in army units and kgb officers to protect 
residents from widespread fighting soviet media reports said 
hundreds of azerbaijanis and armenians have been battling with 
submachine guns helicopters and armored vehicles 
the violence in azerbaijan has heightened soviet fears of moslem 
unrest along its southern border with iran 
tehran has said it welcomes free travel for soviet moslems to 
iran as well as more trade and cultural ties across the border 
azerbaijan once wholly under iranian control was ceded to 
russia in 1828 
in 1946 the red army entered northern iran and set up a puppet 
republic with the aim of controlling all of azerbaijan but the 
soviets withdrew in 1946 following an international outcry

a human rights group is accusing the 
interior ministry of using torture against moslem fundamentalists 
under the leadership of a man who has just been fired by president 
hosni mubarak 
the egyptian organization for human rights on mondayyy alleged a 
rapid rise in torture last year mainly of the fundamentalists it 
said trend has been evident since mid1987 
that was little more than a year after dismissed interior 
minister zaki badr took control of domestic security 
it also was when a court acquitted 41 security men of torturing 
suspects while investigating a coup attempt that closelyy followed 
the assassination of mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat his death 
was blamed on fundamentalists 
while denying the torture charges monday new interior minister 
abdelhalim moussa continued making appearances to mend fences 
shattered by badrs quick tongue 
it was badrs rhetoric rather than his raids on moslem 
fundamentalists that appeared to prompt the announcement of his 
dismissal friday 
in a recent speech badr said all moslem fundamentalists who 
make up about 1 percent of egypts population of 55 million should 
be killed 
he also savaged a variety of politicians journalists and other 
public figures even his cabinet colleagues 
in its report monday the egyptian organization for human rights 
said at least one prisoner died last year under police torture 
many others suffered temporary or permanent physical damage the 
report said 
torture was practiced on a large scale following almost all 
the waves of mass and individual arrests and detentions with 
severe beating slaps punches kicks rifle butts leather belts 
hosepipe bamboo sticks and electric batons in some cases the 
whip was brought back into use to beat and torture detainees the 
report said 
it said that in addition to religious activists victims of 
torture included labor leaders and prominent leftists 
in comments quoted by the middle east news agency the new 
interior minister responded these claims are absolutely 
baseless because prisons in egypt have their regulations and the 
prosecutors and the judiciary have the right to inspect them 
however moussa who has a reputation for concilation has tried 
to assure egyptians that hes different from badr 
in a speech sunday he said religious militancy is a social 
problem rather than one of law enforcement provided extremists do 
not break the law 
police are at the service of the people and not to insult 
them he said

massachusetts attorney general is investigating 
allegations that police intimidated two teenagers into falsely 
linking a black man to the shooting of charles and carol stuart 
attorney general james m shannon also said monday his office 
will take a second look at allegations that boston police were 
stopping and searching young blacks and hispanics without 
sufficient cause 
they are separate issues i think its a mistake to let these 
issues run into one another shannon said i dont think anyone 
should be prejudged here that was the big mistake in the stuart 
story 
the stuarts were shot oct 23 charles stuart who directed 
police over his car phone to his dying wife said a black man 
robbed and shot them after they left a birthing clinic mrs 
stuart seven months pregnant died hours later their son 
delivered by caesarean section died 17 days later stuart was 
seriously wounded 
william bennett a black man with a police record was 
identified in the news media as the prime suspect he was cleared 
after stuart was implicated in the shooting by a younger brother 
and then apparently jumped to his death from a bridge 
two teenagers have said since that they were intimidated by 
police into incriminating bennett 
dereck jackson 17 told reporters friday he was forced to tell 
police that bennett confessed to the stuart shooting in his 
presense 
eric whitney 18 said in a newspaper report that police 
supplied him with undisclosed details of the shooting and pressured 
him to recount them to another detective 
both said they testified falsely to a grand jury but returned 
later and recanted 
on the allegations about intimidation of witnesses im going 
to ask my civil rights division to contact the lawyers in that case 
and see whether they have something they want to tell us shannon 
said 
they havent come to us yet but were not going to let it lie 
there 
in september a superior court judge ruled that police had 
instituted an unconstitutional policy and asked shannon to do 
whatever was necessary to restrain further unreasonable searches 
and seizures by police 
one month later shannon said that after talking with boston 
police he was convinced there was no searchonsight policy

business inventories rose rose 05 percent in 
november but business sales rebounded by a brisker 07 percent the 
government said today 
faster growth of sales than accumulation of goods on shelves and 
backlots is good news for the economy if inventories were to pile 
up excessively it could mean cutbacks in production and a loss of 
jobs 
however some industries such as automobiles already are feeling 
the effects of excessive inventories 
chrysler corp ford motor co and general motors corp all have 
announced temporary layoffs to reduce the number of vehicles stuck 
on backlots mazda motor corp of japan is trimming production at 
its us plant later this month 
the commerce department said inventories climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7968 billion in november after rising 03 percent a 
month earlier that was a bit better than the 04 percent increase 
originally reported 
business sales also rose to a seasonally adjusted 5236 
billion after falling a revised 05 percent in october that 
revision showed a slight improvement over the 07 percent drop 
originally reported 
the result in november business activity produced a slight 
decline to 152 in the ratio of inventories to sales that means 
it would take 152 months to exhaust inventories at the november 
pace the ratio was 153 in october 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as 
output exceeds demand the economy has been experiencing 
sluggishness over the past year as the federal reserve keeps a 
tight rein on credit to slow inflation 
but many economists do not feel the ratio is at a dangerous 
level yet 
retail backlogs rose 06 percent in november while retail sales 
climbed 05 percent but the commerce department reported last week 
that sales gained only 02 percent in december reflecting a modest 
holiday buying season 
inventories at the manufacturing level which represent about 45 
percent of the total rose 03 percent manufacturing sales on the 
other hand increased 05 percent 
wholesalers inventories advanced 05 percent while their sales 
jumped 12 percent 
overall inventories were 68 percent above those of a year ago 
while sales increased 44 percent

the still powerful communist party began 
talks today with an opposition coalition demanding more democracy 
but the two sides immediately stalled over opposition demands for 
offices and its own newspaper 
the disarray played out for an hour in front of reporters 
illustrated the difficulties of trying to move from totalitarian 
rule to more democracy without basic tools for the transition 
the talks come a day after parliament voted unanimously to 
repeal the communist partys guaranteed leading role making 
bulgaria the last warsaw pact country to formally overturn the 
status that shored up stalinist structures in eastern europe for 
more than 40 years 
the union of democratic forces the coalition of bulgarias 
still weak and divided democratic opposition has been pushing 
since november for its own daily newspapers and for offices it 
angrily accused the communists of stalling on both demands 
for many years we know what it means when we dont get an 
answer said petko simeonov a coalition leader our slogans 
and our ideas do not reach everybody we want what we have to say 
to be heard by everybody 
without an office simeonov said the coalition has no venue to 
coordinate positions in broad talks on the countrys future the 
conditions are unfavorable as if on purpose he said 
andrey lukanov the no 2 communist party official said the 
ruling party had done all it could to get authorities to provide 
offices and newsprint but matters were no longer in their hands 
i dont think you should be so suspicious he smiled to the 
opposition seated across from the communists and their allies the 
agrarian party in a brightly lit hall of bulgarias national 
assembly or parliament building 
eventually the two sides agreed to discuss the issue behind 
closed doors with the opposition threatening to withdraw from the 
talks if the quarrel was not settled 
the broad talks are supposed to discuss the transition to 
democracy and the free elections promised by may 
hindered by ethnic conflict and the remaining power of orthodox 
communists in the provinces change is coming slowly to bulgaria 
where hardline communist todor zhivkov was ousted nov 10 after 
more than 35 years in power 
the opposition won another victory monday a promise that 
communist cells will be removed from bulgarias police making it 
politically neutral said petar beron an opposition spokesman 
the opposition backed its demands with a rally of more than 
50000 people on sunday the biggest to date in sofia 
loudly applauded demands there included the calls for the 
resignation of communist premier georgi atanassov a holdover from 
the zhivkov era and adoption of twotiered legislative elections 
in may and november to give the opposition a chance to organize 
against the still powerful communists 
opposition forces see the promised elections as a tactic by the 
communists to preserve much of their power while the opposition is 
still untested and weak 
in other business monday parliament approved a compromise 
reached last week to smooth the friction between the countrys 15 
million moslems mostly ethnic turks and the slavic majority over 
last months decision by the new leadership to restore their 
turkish names and customs 
five years ago zhivkov had forced the ethnic turks to take 
slavic names 
the compromise enforced the dec 29 decision which sparked 
fierce protests across bulgaria but insisted that bulgarian is 
the official language and affirmed bulgarias territorial 
integrity 
criticism of zhivkov peaked during the debate on the sensitive 
ethnic issue with deputies condemning the former leaders hasty 
move last year to allow an estimated 320000 turks to flee 
laborstarved bulgaria 
some 90000 have now returned unable to find work in turkey and 
promised a new more equal life and the restoration of property 
they abandoned by bulgarias new rulers

the supreme court said today it will consider 
limiting the power of environmentalists to prevent the opening up 
of federal lands to commercial development 
the court voted to review a proenviromentalist ruling 
challenged by the bush administration 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last june that the 
national wildlife federation may sue the interior department over 
its plans to change the status of some 180 million acres of public 
land in western states and alaska more than onefourth of the 
nations public lands 
the federation said it is suing to protect federal lands 
against unwise or premature disposition and development 
including millions of acres to be opened up to mining and mineral 
leasing 
the move to reclassify the land for development and other uses 
was made by the reagan administration in 1985 following a policy 
instituted by thensecretary james g watt in 1981 
the wildlife federation said the reagan administration violated 
federal law by opening the land to development without following 
procedures in the 1976 federal land policy and management act 
the appeals court said the federation has legal standing to sue 
because affidavits show some of its 45 million members use some of 
the land for recreation the appeals court overruled a federal 
judge who had thrown out the suit 
the appeals court relied for example on a statement by 
federation member peggy k peterson who said she uses land in the 
south passgreen mountain area of wyoming 
the bush administration said the appeals court permitted a 
wholesale challenge to the interior departments reclassification 
based on a vague allegation it will jeopardize use of a tiny 
portion of the land by wildlife federation members 
the appeals court in effect has ordered a federal judge to 
assume the role of a nationwide landuse czar and determine how 
millions of acres may be used justice department lawyers argued in 
the appeal acted on today 
groups supporting the administration position are the mountain 
states legal foundation the american farm bureau federation the 
national cattlemens association and the american mining congress 
the case is lujan vs national wildlife federation 89640

the supreme court today refused to let a 
machinists union strike against eastern airlines spread to commuter 
railroads 
the court without comment left intact rulings barring sympathy 
strikes against railroads in new york city philadelphia and their 
suburbs 
the machinists who walked off the job last march 4 after 
refusing to give more than 150 million in concessions sought by 
eastern remain on strike pilots and flight attendants supported 
the strike for eight months before ending their walkout in 
november 
the machinists and unions sympathetic to the eastern strike 
sought to extend its impact by setting up picket lines at 
facilities run by the southeastern pennsylvania transportation 
authority septa in the philadelphia area and by amtrak the long 
island railroad metronorth commuter railroad and nj transit rail 
in the new york city metropolitan area 
the new york cityarea railroads carry some 350000 commuters 
daily between new york city and its suburbs the septa trains 
transport more than 90000 commuters each day 
federal judges barred the secondary strikes and the restraining 
orders were upheld by the new yorkbased 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals and the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals 
the appeals courts said collective bargaining agreements between 
the railroads and their unions may be interpreted to prohibit such 
sympathy strikes at least until the labor dispute is submitted to 
arbitration 
underlying the issue is a clash between two federal laws the 
railway labor act and the norrisla guardia act 
the norrisla guardia act limits the power of federal courts to 
enjoin strikes while the railway labor act sets up procedures such 
as arbitration designed to forestall strikes against railroads 
the justices in 1987 ruled that courts generally may not bar 
railroad workers from extending a labor dispute to other railroads 
not directly involved in the dispute 
but the 2nd circuit court said the 1987 ruling applies only in 
cases in which other procedures to end a railway strike are 
exhausted 
the appeals court said the opposite was true in the eastern case 
because there had been no attempt through arbitration to end the 
secondary strikes against the railroads 
since there was a risk of immediate and irreparable injury to 
the railroads and the public the 2nd circuit court said the 
judge acted within his authority in halting the sympathy strikes 
the 3rd circuit court said septa workers do not have the right 
to violate nostrike provisions in their own collective bargaining 
agreements by honoring picket lines set up by eastern employees at 
septa facilities 
lawyers for the machinists union said the power of unions to 
fight for fair treatment is weakened by a ban on sympathy strikes 
they also said the 2nd and 3rd circuit court rulings conflict with 
decisions by other federal appeals courts 
there have been reports that the machinists want to use sympathy 
strikes against the railroads to prompt president bush or congress 
to take action in their walkout against the airline 
the cases are international association of machinists vs long 
island railroad 89427 and 89674 and brotherhood of railroad 
signalmen vs septa 89756

the supreme court today agreed to decide what 
authority police have to stop and question someone on the basis of 
an anonymous tip that the person is involved in a crime 
the justices said they will review an alabama court ruling that 
limited such police tactics 
a state appeals court threw out vanessa whites 1987 conviction 
for possession of marijuana and cocaine ruling that montgomery 
police had seized the drugs after unlawfully stopping her car 
the appeals court said an anonymous tip police received about 
ms white was not enough to justify an investigatory stop by police 
and they therefore had violated her constitutional rights 
the constitutions fourth amendment bans unreasonable police 
seizures and searches 
ms whites twoyear probationary sentence was thrown out along 
with her conviction 
the nations highest court previously has ruled that police can 
make arrests only when they have probable cause to believe 
someone is involved in a crime 
but the court has allowed police to make brief investigatory 
stops to stop question and even frisk someone if they have a 
reasonable suspicion a more lenient standard than probable 
cause 
federal appeals courts and state courts have been divided in 
recent years when ruling whether an anonymous tip to police can 
give rise to such a reasonable suspicion 
in ms whites case the alabama appeals court based its 
decision on an individualized evaluation of the particular tip in 
light of the totality of the circumstances 
on april 22 1987 police cpl bh davis received an anonymous 
telephone call telling him that ms white would be leaving a 
certain apartment at a particular time in a brown station wagon to 
go to a motel the caller said ms white would have with her about 
an ounce of cocaine in a brown attache case 
police went to the apartment and kept it under surveillance 
they saw ms white leave in a brown station wagon and drive to a 
motel they then approached ms white and told her about the call 
they had received 
an officer asked for permission to search the station wagon and 
ms white said he could a brown attache case was found inside and 
after ms white told officers the combination to its lock 
marijuana was found inside it 
after ms white was arrested police found three milligrams of 
cocaine inside her purse 
in throwing out ms whites conviction the state appeals court 
said because she was illegally detained when she gave her 
consent to the search the marijuana from the briefcase and the 
cocaine from her purse are fruits of an unconstitutional 
detention 
such evidence should have been barred from her prosecution the 
appeals court said 
it added here the stop cannot be supported by specific and 
articulable reliable facts raising a reasonable suspicion that ms 
white was engaged in wrongdoing 
after the alabama supreme court refused to review the case 
state attorney general don siegelman filed the appeal acted on 
today 
the justices in 1980 and 1981 turned down requests to decide 
whether an anonymous tip can justify an investigatory stop each 
time several justices voted to resolve the issue 
the case is alabama vs white 89789

trans world airlines flight attendants who 
accused twa owner carl icahn of sex bias in seeking wage cuts and 
other concessions that triggered a strike lost a supreme court 
appeal today 
the court without comment refused to revive a lawsuit against 
the airline the flight attendants sought back pay and other 
benefits 
the independent federation of flight attendants called a strike 
against twa on march 7 1986 two months later the union offered 
to return to work and accept twas demands 
about 200 strikers were rehired immediately but more than three 
years passed before the last of the 5000 striking attendants were 
offered jobs with twa 
the strike was called when icahn insisted on wage and other 
concessions for attendants 85 percent of them women that were 
greater than cuts he sought to impose against the airlines pilots 
machinists and other workers 
during the negotiations with the attendants union icahn said it 
would be easy for him to find young untrained women to be 
stewardesses for less than he was paying the attendants 
when union negotiators said janitors who belonged to the 
machinists union were offered a better deal than the attendants 
icahn remarked 
a janitor is a breadwinner who probably has got a family at 
home to support while you girls are second incomes and you dont 
need the money 
the union said the statement demonstrated bias against women and 
violated fair bargaining procedures mandated by the federal railway 
labor act which governs labor negotiations for airlines and 
railroads 
the strike against twa should be viewed by the courts as one 
based on unfair labor practices and not only on demands for more 
money the unions lawyers said 
unlike workers who walk off the job over pay and benefits 
strikers who prove unfair labor practices by an employer are 
entitled to their old jobs when they unconditionally return to work 
us district judge howard f sachs in missouri rejected the 
unions claims that icahn was guilty of sexual stereotyping 
icahns breadwinner remarks were foolish and offensive 
sachs said but he said icahn apparently was trying to rationalize 
his negotiating strategy of demanding more cuts from the attendants 
the judge said the real reason icahn made a more generous offer 
to the machinists was because that union could do greater damage 
to twa in a strike and because icahn believed it would be easier 
to replace the attendants with untrained workers 
there has been no persuasive showing that sex stereotyping 
governed or influenced icahns economic demands only his 
rationalizations sachs said 
greedy employers like greedy unions have a legal right to 
try their strength and to enforce demands through the collective 
bargaining process the judge said 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
last june 
the justices last year made it easier for workers to win suits 
against employers accused of sexual stereotyping but that decision 
was based on a federal civil rights law banning workplace 
discrimination not the railway labor act at issue in the case 
acted on today 
the case is independent federation of flight attendants vs twa

the supreme court today blocked indefinitely 
the effect of a lowercourt ruling that could have provided natural 
gas consumers with tens of millions of dollars in refunds 
the justices granting an emergency request by 21 energy 
companies held in abeyance a decision by the 5th us circuit 
court of appeals that could have led to the refunds 
justice byron r white last week granted a temporary stay of the 
appeals court ruling and the courts order today extended that 
stay until it acts on a formal appeal to be filed by the energy 
companies 
the new orleansbased appeals court last sept 16 invalidated a 
4yearold federal regulation that allowed gas producers to raise 
some prices 
the appeals court ruled that the federal energy regulatory 
commission exceeded its authority in 1986 when permitting producers 
of old gas to raise their prices and to stop selling to 
pipeline companies not willing to pay the higher prices 
old gas is from wells that were producing before nov 9 1978 
congress that year approved a partial decontrol of the natural 
gas industry oldgas prices remained controlled but no caps were 
imposed on the price of gas from new wells 
the commissions 1986 regulation known as order 451 allowed 
the ceiling price of old gas to rise from 52 cents per thousand 
cubic feet to 275 
consumers distributors and pipeline companies challenged order 
451 leading to the 5th circuit court ruling 
in seeking emergency help lawyers for the energy companies said 
they would soon file a formal appeal seeking to overturn the 
appeals court decision which they said casts into doubt hundreds 
of gassupply contracts signed since 1986 
the justices were told that if the september ruling takes effect 
it will generate numerous contract disputes and introduce a 
period of great uncertainty in the entire natural gas market all 
during the winter heating season

the supreme court today refused to kill 
lawsuits against two pennsylvania school officials by two former 
students who say they were sexually assaulted by their high school 
band instructor 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
officials are not entitled to qualified legal immunity from being 
sued by kathleen stoneking and judy grove sowers former students 
at bradford area high school 
both women allege they were were sexually assaulted by edward 
wright the high schools former band instructor both women were 
band members 
wright was suspended in 1986 and later resigned he pleaded 
guilty to criminal charges including indecent assault that same 
year and received a probationary sentence 
both cases were before the justices last year and were sent 
back to a federal appeals court for additional study 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last aug 16 and 
sept 8 that the lawsuits against frederick smith the high 
schools principal and richard miller its assistant principal 
should go to trial 
the appeals court dismissed frederick shuey the nowretired 
school district superintendent as a defendant in both suits 
ms stoneking was graduated from high school in 1983 her 1987 
suit contends that the school officials failed to protect her 
the suit alleges that beginning in her sophomore year wright 
sexually harassed and abused her and forced her to engage in 
various sexual acts with him the suit alleges that school 
officials knew of complaints against wright involving other female 
students 
mrs sowers suit alleges she was sexually assaulted by wright 
at his home in june 1979 
in separate orders last march and april the justices told the 
3rd circuit court to restudy the two cases in light of their 
february 1989 decision that government officials have no 
constitutional duty to protect citizens from private violence or 
abuse 
that decision shielded child welfare officials from being sued 
for returning a young wisconsin boy jason deshaney to the custody 
of his father who subsequently beat him so severely the boy is now 
permanently braindamaged 
ruling in ms stonekings case last august the 3rd circuit 
court cited a major difference between it and the wisconsin case 
deshaneys injuries resulted at the hands of a private actor his 
father whereas stonekings resulted from the actions of a state 
employee wright was a school district employee subject to 
defendants immediate control 
the appeals court cited its august ruling in ms stonekings 
case when reinstating mrs sowers suit in september 
the cases are smith vs stoneking 89780 and smith vs sowers

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
broadening the power of states to sue in behalf of gas consumers 
allegedly overcharged by utility companies 
the court said it will hear an appeal by kansas and missouri 
officials who have accused utilities of illegal pricefixing 
the appeal was supported by 32 other states seeking to protect 
their consumers and vigorously enforce antitrust laws 
asked for its views the bush administration urged the court to 
review the issue saying lower courts have reached conflicting 
conclusions 
kansas and missouri officials sued the kansas power amp light co 
and utilicorp united inc over natural gas transported by pipeline 
from wyoming and used to generate electricity sold to customers in 
the two states 
some of the natural gas delivered from wyoming was sold to the 
utilities customers 
the states alleged that gasproducing companies conspired to 
inflate the price of the gas and that the utilities passed on the 
higher rates to consumers 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled in january 1989 
that the states do not have the authority to sue in behalf of 
residential customers 
the appeals court said that only direct purchasers of fixed 
amounts of gas may sue in such cases 
any allocation of illegal overcharges to the residential 
consumers may require tracing the sale from the wellhead through 
each level of distribution to establish the amount of illegal gas 
costs actually paid adding new dimensions of complexity to 
antitrust suits the appeals court said 
residential indirect purchaseers of natural gas are not 
entitled to sue the alleged violators the appeals court said

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that a state may ban pharmacists from selling prescription drugs at 
a discount 
the court without comment rejected a challenge to a new jersey 
law banning drug discounts and rebates except for medications sold 
to people over 62 
the new jersey supreme court ruled last august that the law 
attacked as a form of economic protectionism has rational purposes 
and therefore is constitutional 
restricting prescription discounts prevents potentially 
destructive price wars that could erode the integrity of 
pharmaceutical services the state court said 
the state court also ruled that it is reasonable to discourage 
people from shopping around at different drug stores for the best 
buy saying that could undermine the use of socalled drug profiles 
the profiles are kept on file by some pharmacists to check for 
possible allergic reactions or use of incompatible prescription 
drugs by customers 
even if a court cannot ascertain the actual purpose of the 
statute it should sustain the statute if it has any conceivable 
rational purpose the state court said 
the law was challenged by consumer value stores cvs a chain 
that in 1985 advertised a special oneweek 3 price for most 
prescription drugs at its stores in wayne nj 
timothy brophy a pharmacist at a cvs store in wayne was fined 
500 by the new jersey pharmaceutical board 
the drug store chain said the ban on discounts discriminates 
against cutrate pharmacies and hurts economic competition the 
chain said the law is designed for the economic protection of a 
limited group in a profession whose lobby in a state legislature is 
more effective or more powerful than the lobby of others in the 
profession 
the law is irrational because customers 62 and older who are 
more likely to need medication are not afforded the presumed 
protection of banning discounts cvs said 
consumers are entitled to purchase prescription drugs at a 
pharmacy of their choice without undue influence from the state 
lawyers for the store said 
the new jersey supreme court said exempting senior citizens from 
the ban on discounts is a reasonable legislative response to 
economic pressure on the elderly 
the case is consumer value stores vs board of pharmacy 89801

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether nonprofit social clubs that are generally exempt from 
federal income taxes can use losses incurred from selling food and 
drink to nonmembers to offset investment profits 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the portland golf club 
in oregon in which at least 4 million in tax revenue nationwide is 
at stake 
the bush administration urged the justices to use the golf 
clubs appeal to settle a conflict between two federal appeals 
courts 
the golf club is exempt from paying federal income tax on dues 
and other fees paid by its members it qualifies for the exemption 
as a social club organized for pleasure recreation and other 
nonprofitable purposes 
but the club also receives income from selling food and drink to 
nonmembers and in interest from its investments that income is 
not exempt from federal taxation 
the internal revenue service said the golf club owed 5298 in 
taxes for 1980 and 1981 
the club said it lost 98041 those two years from selling food 
and drink to nonmembers because its expenses and overhead for that 
activity exceeded income from the sales 
the club sought to use the losses to offset profits from its 
investments 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in june that the 
losses are not deductible because the club had not intended the 
sale of food and drink to nonmembers to be a profitmaking 
activity 
that ruling conflicted with a decision in another case by the 
6th us circuit court of appeals 
the justice department said the supreme court should resolve the 
conflict it said there have been several hundred irs audits over 
the issue involving about 4 million 
the case is portland golf club vs commissioner of internal 
revenue 89530

the supreme court today curtailed an illinois 
public nuisance law that has been used to shut down adult 
bookstores and theaters for up to a year 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the state 
law sometimes violates the freespeech rights of bookstore and 
theater owners 
the high court ruled in a new york case in 1986 that states may 
close down for long periods adult bookstores found to be public 
nuisances because of the onpremises conduct of their patrons 
but the illinois law in the case acted on today was more 
sweeping it permitted closing such stores and theaters if the 
operators were convicted of selling obscene material 
the illinois law said the establishment could either be closed 
or could be allowed to remain open if the owners posted a bond that 
would be forfeited if obscene material was sold on the premises 
the case stemmed from an attempted crackdown against the denmark 
ii bookstore in kendall county ill the building was leased by 
bruce and cathy riemenschneider to sequoia books inc 
there were numerous obscenity prosecutions against the bookstore 
from 1982 to 1985 resulting in eight guilty verdicts but the 
store remained open for business 
then in 1986 the state sought to declare the bookstore a public 
nuisance and a judge ordered it shut down for one year unless 
sequoia books posted a 5000 bond the bond was posted but the 
judge ruled that obscene magazines then were sold at the store and 
the bond was revoked 
the illinois supreme court ruled last march that the 
antinuisance law was unconstitutional 
the state argues that the sale of obscene material is the 
equivalent of the sexual conduct involved in the 1986 case 
decided by the supreme court the state court said we do not 
agree that the sale of obscene material and actual sexual conduct 
can be so easily equated 
the illinois court said states may not shut down establishments 
that sell nonobscene material merely because some obscene works 
have been sold 
this blunderbuss approach is inconsistent with our 
traditional insistence that the regulation of any form of 
expression even of obscenity be carefully drawn so as not to 
impact unduly upon protected speech the state court said 
the justices had a similar question under study in a dallas case 
decided last week 
in that case the court left unanswered whether anyone convicted 
of certain crimes may be barred from operating a sexually oriented 
business 
instead the high court struck down that part of the dallas 
ordinance requiring all sexually oriented businesses to acquire 
special licenses because of inadequate safeguards against licensing 
delays 
the case acted on today is illinois vs sequoia books 881844

boris yeltsin the maverick soviet communist party 
member and parliamentarian said today that force should not be 
used to quell ethnic unrest in its southern republics 
speaking of ethnic unrest and economic problems yeltsin told 
japanese journalists this year is very critical we are at a 
turning point whether a very ill patient will be able to recover 
or not 
recent ethnic strife has killed more than 56 people in fighting 
between ethnic armenians and azerbaijanis official reports say 
soviet troops have been deployed to try to stop the fighting one 
of the bloodiest conflicts facing the country 
yeltsin said the use of force to suppress local movements for 
autonomy would only increase the number of republics that wish to 
secede he did not say whether he meant force by the army or by the 
warring ethnic groups 
these issues should not be resolved through force we have had 
enough bloodshed already yeltsin told reporters at japans 
national press club 
patience and endurance is necessary this is the sole 
possibility i see there is no other drastic means to settle the 
situation he told reporters at japans national press club 
yeltsin also said the communist party must be fundamentally 
reformed its monopoly on power abolished and autonomy granted to 
the nations republics 
yeltsin repeated his support for president mikhail gorbachevs 
policy of perestroika or restructuring but he said 
gorbachevs failure to deal with reform in a fundamental way 
had caused a worsening of the situation in the soviet union and a 
drop in gorbachevs popularity 
the economy is facing a crisis and the situation of ethnic 
groups is at a crucial stage he said the society in general 
is facing a crisis 
he said perestroika following decades of repression had 
reawakened ethnic consciousness and allowed citizens to express 
their opinions freely 
but yeltsin said attempts by gorbachev to limit the extent of 
the reforms were like trying to extinguish a fire after it 
starts 
yeltsins remarks in russian were translated into japanese and 
then into english 
yeltsin is in japan on a 10day speaking tour which will 
include a meeting with prime minister toshiki kaifu

the plea came as the financial institution was about to go on 
trial in the first federal prosecution of a major bank on charges 
of conspiring to aid drug trafficking through secret accounts 
one of the defendants amjad awan of coral gables has said he 
was once manuel antonio noriegas banker but the luxembourg bank 
had filed a motion to keep the fallen panamanian dictators name 
out of the case 
the banking company which operates in 73 countries was allowed 
to continue operations in the united states after putting 14 
million in escrow to cover the amount the government contended the 
bank had laundered in addition to the indictments the government 
sued for forfeiture of property and other assets 
a defense motion had sought to prohibit prosecutors from 
mentioning noriega which the defense expected because stephen 
michael kalish is among the drug dealers on the government witness 
list 
kalish testified for the prosecution in a federal marijuana 
smuggling trial that ended monday with acquittals of 16 defendants 
and convictions of four in lafayette la 
kalish arrested in tampa in 1984 and serving 15 years without 
parole has testified that he secured panama banking for his 
marijuana smuggling ring in 1983 by giving noriega an attache case 
stuffed with 300000 in bills 
according to the government kalish also met with awan and 
deposited an initial 2 million from marijuana smuggling into an 
account with the bank in panama city 
during us senate testimony before his arrest awan said such a 
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it 
awan 41 who was assistant division director of the bank for 
latin america in miami told senate investigators he personally 
managed a secret account noriega opened at the banks panamanian 
branch in 1982 awan said noriega was the only one who could 
authorize withdrawals from the account which contained up to 25 
million 
awan told the investigators noriega closed his bank account 
after the indictments were announced awan denied knowledge of any 
drug dealing by noriega or the bank 
according to the indictment undercover customs agents contacted 
representatives of the bank in 1987 and opened accounts at 
different branches bank officials were to receive drug money and 
put it in certificates of deposit in one of the branches agents 
said 
investigators said bank officials would create a loan at another 
branch permit drug traffickers to withdraw the funds then repay 
the loan with money in the certificates 
the branches used reportedly included locations in france 
panama uruguay the bahamas luxembourg and britain

prosecutors are considering criminal charges 
against protesters who ransacked the capitals secret police 
headquarters national police chief dieter winderlich said today 
the announcement came hours after east germanys ruling 
communists said the storming of the building monday showed the 
countrys street revolution could get out of hand 
winderlich told a news conference that protesters also had 
broken into the buildings section for counterespionage activities 
but did not discover the identity of the sections workers 
he said the protesters caused hundreds of thousands of dollars 
in damage to the eightstory building 
the building today remained under control of an oppositionled 
citizens committee regular police officers and government 
representatives 
also today workers at a stateowned factory in the city of gera 
staged a politically motivated warning strike to show their 
dissatisfaction with the communists according to west berlins 
rias radio station 
in bonn the conservative daily newspaper die welt said soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev was expected to visit east berlin in 
the next two or three weeks 
die welt quoting wellinformed sources in east berlin said 
gorbachev plans a massive show of support for his longtime 
friend east german communist premier hans modrow 
dirk bachmann east berlins police chief said opposition 
groups calls for restraint had prevented injuries during the 
storming of the secret police building 
the protesters demanded the ouster of the communists and 
expressed anger at the government for not moving faster to 
dismantle the secret police and carry out reforms 
three months after a peaceful popular revolt toppled old 
hardline communist leaders the party still essentially controls 
the government media economy and bureaucracy 
the communist party daily newspaper neues deutschland said in a 
commentary that the organizers of protests like that at the secret 
police headquarters must accept responsibility for the consequences 
responsibility also means means having a clear idea about 
consequences before calling for a demonstration so that things 
dont get out of hand the newspaper said in a frontpage 
editorial 
it added the call for no violence which has marked the 
street revolution from the start becomes a farce when emotions 
break through the bounds of reason 
opposition leaders called for calm and an end to the destruction 
a day earlier new forum opposition group called for the 
protests to oppose what it called the restoration policy of 
communists seeking to gain an advantage before the may elections 
according to the official news agency adn 
the call was answered by hundreds of thousands of people 
including those who stormed the secret police headquarters 
dozens of protesters in the southern city of cottbus had pelted 
the local secret police building with rocks and unsuccessfully 
tried to enter it 
official news media also reported that about 500000 people 
demonstrated against the communists and secret police in at least a 
dozen cities on monday evening 
addressing the crowd at the berlin secret police headquarters 
through a loudspeaker system modrow asked the protesters to stay 
in a dialogue with his shaky coalition government and expressed 
full understanding for the rage caused by decades of repression 
at the hands of the secret police 
hours earlier modrow had offered opposition groups a far 
greater say in running the caretaker government before democratic 
elections on may 6 
the protest actions are reaching further into virtually all 
parts of society and even all age groups increasingly children 
and older adults in their 50s and 60s are joining in 
east germanys staterun television interrupted its programs 
several times to broadcast a warning against further actions like 
that in east berlin 
the democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest 
danger it warned 
government officials at talks with the opposition monday morning 
had outlined a chilling array of rifles rocketpropelled grenades 
and machine guns controlled by the secret police 
the disclosures which were broadcast live included news that 
the secret police consumed more than 1 percent of the national 
budget

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether people accused of child abuse have the right to at least 
one facetoface confrontation with their young accusers 
the justices in two cases of enormous importance for 
childabuse prosecutions nationwide said they will consider 
reinstating the childmolesting conviction of a maryland daycare 
center owner and an idaho womans childabuse conviction 
decisions in the two cases are expected by july they mark the 
courts second venture into this area of criminal law in the past 
two years 
stating that the constitutions sixth amendment requires a 
facetoface confrontation the justices in 1988 struck down an 
iowa mans sexualassault conviction because two 13yearold girls 
were allowed to testify while protected by a large screen placed in 
the courtroom between them and the defendant 
the sixth amendment in part says in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to be 
confronted with the witnesses against him 
the 1988 decision appeared to leave unanswered whether there may 
be exceptions to the facetoface requirement 
in other action the court 
said it will consider limiting the power of environmentalists 
to prevent the opening up of federal lands to commerical 
development 
the court voted to review a proenvironmentalist ruling 
challenged by the bush administration the case involves a us 
circuit court of appeals ruling last june that the national 
wildlife federation may sue the interior department over plans to 
change the status of some 180 million acres of public land in 
western states and alaska 
agreed to decide what authority police have to stop and 
question someone on the basis of an anonymous tip that the person 
is involved in a crime 
the justices said they will review an alabama court ruling that 
limited such police tactics 
refused to kill lawsuits against two pennsylvania school 
officials by two former students who say they were sexually 
assaulted by their high school band instructor 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
officials are not entitled to qualified legal immunity from being 
sued by the two former students 
refused to let a machinists union strike against eastern 
airlines spread to commuter railroads 
the court without comment left intact rulings barring sympathy 
strikes against railroads in new york city philadelphia and their 
suburbs 
blocked indefinitely the effect of a lower court ruling that 
could have provided natural gas consumers with tens of millions of 
dollars in refunds 
the justices granting an emergency request by 21 energy 
companies held in abeyance a 5th us circuit court of appeals 
decision that could have led to the refunds 
agreed to consider broadening the power of states to sue in 
behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility companies 
the court said it will hear an appeal by kansas and missouri 
officials who have accused utilities of illegal pricefixing 
in one of the child abuse cases marylands highest court threw 
out sandra a craigs conviction saying her 7yearold accuser and 
three other young witnesses wrongly were allowed to testify against 
her over closedcircuit television 
but the state court stopped short of invalidating the maryland 
law that allows young children to testify by closedcircuit 
television outside the presence of the defendant in such cases 
about half the states have similar laws 
the trial judge was constitutionally required to question the 
children however briefly in mrs craigs presence the state 
court said 
that was the only way the state court concluded that the judge 
could determine whether the children would suffer serious 
emotional distress if forced to testify in court with mrs craig 
present 
the judge instead relied on the pretrial testimony of experts in 
deciding that such courtroom testimony would be traumatic for the 
children 
that violated mrs craigs sixth amendment right to confront all 
adverse witnesses the states highest court said its ruling cited 
a 1988 supreme court decision 
stating that the sixth amendment requires a facetoface 
confrontation the justices last year struck down an iowa mans 
sexualassault conviction because two 13yearold girls were 
allowed to testify while protected by a large screen placed in the 
courtroom between them and the defendant 
the 1988 decision appeared to leave unanswered whether there may 
be exceptions to the facetoface requirement 
in the appeal acted on today maryland attorney general j 
joseph curran jr said the state court ruling in mrs craigs case 
struck an untrue balance between a defendants constitutional 
right and the compelling governmental interest of safeguarding 
the physical and psychological wellbeing of a child 
the appeal was supported in friendofthecourt briefs 
submitted by 28 states and various childrens rights groups 
in its ruling last july the maryland court of appeals said mrs 
craig is entitled to a new trial on charges that she sexually 
molested a girl who attended her howard county daycare center for 
two years before it was closed in 1986 
mrs craig had been sentenced to 10 years in prison for her 1987 
conviction on those charges 
she also faces trial on charges stemming from the alleged 
molestation of 12 other children who attended the daycare center 
in clarksville md 
at the 1987 trial four children were allowed to testify outside 
the courtroom with only a prosecutor and one of mrs craigs 
lawyers present mrs craig and her other lawyer remained in the 
courtroom where they could watch the testimony over a 
closedcircuit television 
mrs craig and her lawyer in the courtroom could talk privately 
with her lawyer in the other room by telephone during the 
testimony the four young witnesses were crossexamined by mrs 
craigs lawyer in the room 
in the idaho case the issue is whether a defendants right to 
confrontation was violated by the testimony of a pediatrician who 
had examined a 2yearold girl allegedly abused by her father 
laura lee wright and robert giles were convicted in idaho of 
lewd conduct committed on mrs wrights two daughters who were 
then 5 and 2 
mrs wright was sentenced to 20 years in prison but the state 
supreme court threw out her conviction last june 13 and ordered a 
new trial 
the state court ruled that the trial judge wrongly had allowed a 
pediatrician who had examined the 2yearold girl to testify about 
what she told him the girl did not testify at the trial and 
therefore could not be crossexamined by mrs wrights lawyer 
the state court said the pediatricians testimony lacks 
particularized guarantees of trustworthiness and in fact is 
fraught with the dangers of unreliability which the sixth 
amendment is designed to highlight and obviate 
the cases are maryland vs craig 89478 and idaho vs wright

the united states expressed concern today 
over civilian casualties in three weeks of fighting between 
liberian soldiers and opponents of president samuel k doe 
we deplore actions whether by government troops or 
insurgents which lead to such casualties said a statement 
issued by the us embassy in monrovia the liberian capital 
sporadic fighting was reported today as government troops 
continued a search for rebels who said they have launched another 
offensive 
as far as we know there is still some fighting going on a 
western diplomat said in a telephone interview from monrovia 
the us embassy statement said officials had discussed the 
fighting with governments in the region but did not elaborate 
it also said officials were encouraging humanitarian groups 
including the international committee of the red cross and the un 
high commissioner for refugees to help an estimated 20000 people 
who have fled the fighting 
the government says the rebels who allegedly came from ivory 
coast on dec 24 killed 200 civilians before government troops 
brought the situation under control 
liberian authorities say 16 government officials were also 
killed after the rebels attacked the villages of butuo and karnplay 
near the border 
but two major human rights groups africa watch of new york and 
amnesty international of london have accused the military of also 
killing unarmed civilians 
jenkins scott liberias justice minister said last week that 
soldiers killed some civilians but insisted they acted in 
selfdefense 
amnesty international quoted refugees and other sources as 
saying hundreds of civilian were killed by the rebels and the 
military 
amnesty international said the fighting has forced 20000 
liberians to flee to ivory coast and guinea 
president houphouetboigny of ivory coast said earlier this 
month that between 8000 and 10000 people had entered his country 
charles taylor the selfproclaimed leader of the liberian

the supreme court today left intact a 156 
million award against a montana religious group sued by a former 
member 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the award 
violates the organizations religious freedom 
church universal amp triumphant was sued by gregory mull a 
53yearold san francisco architect when in 1974 he started taking 
part in the churchs activities 
mull who died in 1986 moved in 1979 to calabasas calif site 
of the churchs headquarters at the time known as camelot the 
church moved its headquarters to montana in 1986 
he said elizabeth clare prophet the churchs spiritual leader 
with the title messenger of the ascended masters promised mull 
would help design buildings for the groups proposed 33 million 
new jerusalem in calabasas 
according to court documents the church secretly had abandoned 
the project without telling mull the suit alleged that the church 
was using his architectural plans to help raise millions of dollars 
in donations 
mull also accused the church of violating his privacy rights by 
disclosing details of his sex life given in a confession to 
mrs prophet 
he also sued the church for inflicting emotional distress 
alleging he was pressured into giving up his last 5500 in savings 
at a time when he was out of work and supporting his daughter in 
college 
a california appeals court in upholding the 156 million jury 
award last april said mull was subject to constant and shameful 
pressures to part with his money and that he became so destitute 
he and his daughter took food from grocery store garbage bins 
the daughter linda witt is mulls heir 
the church said the damage award should be overturned because 
in part it was based on prejudicial evidence and ridicule of the 
churchs religious practices by mulls lawyer 
for example the church said mrs prophets husband edward 
francis testifed under questioning by mulls lawyer that he 
believed he was the reincarnation of captain cook 
the lawyer then prefaced the next question by saying let me 
ask you this one as mr francis instead of captain cook 
the church said the jury also was prejudiced by the testimony of 
a witness for mull who said he once had an adulterous affair with 
mrs prophet 
the church said mulls suit was based on the claim he had been 
reduced to a slave of the church the resulting damage award 
constitutes an unprecedented threat to the free exercise of 
religion of minority religious organizations and their members 
the church said 
the justices have rejected two similar appeals recently 
in october they left intact a ruling that an evangelical 
christian group must return 55 million donated by a department 
store heiress when she was a member 
the court last may refused to shield the rev sun myung moons 
unification church from being sued by two former california members 
who said they were brainwashed into joining it 
the case acted on today is church universal amp triumphant vs 
witt 89672

chinas communist party today called for fiscal 
austerity until at least 1991 outlined tough measures to lower the 
boom on nonessential industries and acknowledged that more 
workers will lose their jobs 
the plan reflects the current conservative leaderships drive to 
revive state controls over the economy which were loosened during 
the previous 10 years of reform and decentralization 
it also underscores the desire to give priority to the 
development of large staterun industries the party said some 
factories in particular smaller private enterprises will be 
closed during the austerity drive 
the plan which also urges controls on consumer demand was put 
foward in a lengthy party document on economic readjustment 
the policy paper carried by the official xinhua news agency does 
not mention any plans to introduce new marketoriented reforms 
reforms have effectively been put on hold since austerity 
policies were first adopted in fall 1988 and particularly after the 
ouster of proreform party leader zhao ziyang when prodemocracy 
protests were crushed in june 
the 39point document made public today was prepared for a 
plenary session of the party central committee in november it has 
apparently been circulated to party offices 
it says the task of restoring order to the economy that began in 
fall 1988 would take three years or more the paper also said the 
nations spending habits must be sharply curtailed during that time 
the party which under zhao was moving toward a policy of 
noninterference in economic affairs must enhance its leading role 
in guiding the economy the document said 
it said the nations economic goals are to bring the inflation 
rate under 10 percent a year keep annual growth of the gross 
national product to 56 percent keep new currency issues down and 
balance the budget the gross national product is the total worth 
of all goods and services 
china achieved some of those goals in 1989 bringing inflation 
down from a high of more than 30 percent in 1988 to less than 10 
percent in the final months of 1989 
however the governments tight credit and suspension of 
thousands of building projects have led to widespread bankruptcies 
plant shutdowns and a growing unemployment problem 
in the plan the party acknowledged that some workers will 
become unemployed 
china says the urban unemployment rate is approaching 4 percent 
up from 2 percent before the austerity drive the figures do not 
include millions of rural residents without work because of the 
slowdown 
the government has also fallen further into debt because of 
decreased revenues and huge subsidies provided faltering staterun

a luxembourg bank pleaded guilty today in a 
32 million global moneylaundering case with links to cocaine 
traffickers and fallen dictator manuel noriega and agreed to 
forfeit a record 14 million 
under the plea bargain the two divisions of the bank of credit 
and commerce international will also receive five years probation 
the plea did not affect charges against six bank officers one 
of whom said he was noriegas personal banker and two colombians 
prosecutors say were part of the medellin cocaine cartel their 
case opened today with pretrial motions 
but under the plea bargain bcci agreed to cooperate in 
prosecuting the remaining defendants 
the cash forfeiture of 14 million frozen by the government was 
the largest ever by a financial institution in the united states 
said dave runkel us justice department spokesman 
bcci entered the plea as it was about to go on trial in the 
first federal prosecution of a major bank on charges of conspiring 
to aid drug trafficking through secret accounts 
the more than 30 charges against the two bank entities included 
tax fraud failure to report currency transactions over 10000 and 
laundering cocaine profits 
us district judge w terrell hodges did not immediately set a 
sentencing date he imposed a gag order to prevent parties in the 
case from talking to the news media and bank officials and 
attorneys refused comment on the agreement 
during a twoyear sting called operation cchase customs agents 
posed as money launderers and penetrated powerful colombian 
syndicates authorities said 
according to the indictment agents contacted bcci 
representatives in 1987 and opened accounts at different branches 
bcci officials were to receive drug money and put it in 
certificates of deposit in the branches agents said 
the branches used reportedly included locations in france 
panama uruguay the bahamas luxembourg and england 
customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for 
colombian drug traffickers investigators said bank officials would 
create a loan at a branch permit the agents to withdraw the funds 
then repay the loan with the cds 
the bank divisions and nine of its officers were indicted in 
1988 noriega is not mentioned in the indictment 
altogether more than 80 people were accused of participating in 
drugrelated moneylaundering in eight us cities detroit 
philadelphia chicago los angeles houston miami new york and 
tampa and london and paris 
bcci with operations in 73 countries was allowed to continue 
doing business after putting 14 million in escrow to cover the 
amount the government contended the bank had laundered 
among those still facing trial is amjad awan of coral gables 
who claims he was noriegas banker managing an account that held 
up to 25 million 
also charged are gonzalo mora jr who prosecutors claim 
operated a moneylaundering network based in medellin colombia to 
help traffickers and rudolph armbrect described as moras partner 
the defense has filed a motion to prohibit prosecutors from 
bringing noriega into the case a move the defense expects because 
stephen michael kalish is among the drug kingpins on the government 
witness list 
kalish arrested in 1984 and serving 15 years has testified 
that he secured safe panama banking for his marijuana smuggling 
ring in 1983 by giving noriega an attache case stuffed with 
300000 in bills 
according to the government kalish also met with awan and 
deposited an initial 2 million in marijuana cash into a bcci 
account in panama city 
during us senate testimony before his arrest awan said such a 
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it 
awan 41 who was assistant division director of bbci for latin 
america in miami told senate investigators he managed a secret 
account noriega opened at the banks panamanian branch in 1982 
awan said noriega was the only one who could authorize withdrawals 
from the account 
awan told investigators noriega closed his account when the 
indictments were announced awan denied knowledge of any drug 
dealing by noriega or the bank 
the other defendants in the case are syed aftab hussain 
operations officer of the panamanian branch akbar a bilgrami of 
miami director of the latin american division sibte hassan an 
officer with the paris branch ian howard a french manager based 
in paris and iqbal ashraf of lawndale calif manager of the los 
angeles branch of bcci

authorities intercepted two letter bombs at an 
army office today and scotland yard warned the public to be on the 
alert for suspicious packages 
police said the bombs in brown padded envelopes were found and 
defused at the army south east district headquarters in aldershot 
40 miles southwest of london the offices were evacuated police 
said 
the british domestic news agency press association quoted army 
sources as saying the bombs were sent to individual officers who 
were not identified 
the public must be vigilant when opening mail said cmdr 
george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist 
branch if at all suspicious they must be urged to contact police 
immediately and leave the parcel alone 
churchillcoleman said military personnel and public officials 
connected with northern ireland affairs should be particularly 
alert 
two months ago police defused a bomb under a car in west london 
that was apparently intended for a british army general 
churchillcoleman at the time would not specifically say the car 
bomb was the work of the irish republican army but that the group 
had been carrying out a bombing campaign on the british mainland 
and this appears to be that kind of device 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing said at the time it 
knew nothing about the car bomb 
the ira is fighting british rule in northern ireland it wants 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 
overwhelmingly catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule

the publication of the koran in comicbook form 
drew more fire from islamic groups as the leading religious body of 
tunisia called for it to be banned as an impious work 
in a statement made public in tunis on monday the higher 
islamic council said the comic book if the koran were told to 
me which has been published in france has brought prejudice 
against the sanctity of the koran and moslems 
the illustration of the teachings of the holy koran by profane 
images constitutes sacrilege and heresy the statement said 
the koran is the sacred book of islam according to moslems it 
contains the words of god as revealed to the prophet mohammed 
the comic books are the work of youssef seddik a tunisianborn 
academic who has lived in paris since 1983 he was in tunis and not 
immediately available for comment according to his wife saida 
seddik 46 said in an interview earlier this month that his 
goal was simply to make the koran more accessible to young people 
and not to violate the sacredness of islam 
the tunisian religious body condemned seddik for not having 
consulted experts in islamic jurisprudence before publishing the 
comic books and appealed to islamic groups and the publishing world 
to act efficiently so as to prevent the repetition of such acts 
and thus preserve the inviolability of the sacredness of islam 
the series of comic books was criticized last week by mohammed 
faidallah head of islamic jurisprudence at kuwait university as 
ridiculing the sanctity of the holy koran 
he was quoted as calling seddik a new salman rushdie the 
indianborn british novelist condemned to death last year by the 
late ayotollah ruhollah khomeini for the satanic verses 
rushdie has been in hiding ever since 
my husband was completely astounded by the fact that people 
are comparing him to rushdie mrs seddik said tuesday he 
expected some people not to like it but he never dreamed he would 
be accused of blasphemy 
the comic book illustrations are accompanied by exact quotations 
from the koran complete with chapter and verse references

secretary of state james a baker iii 
renewing his attempt to open mideast peace talks was meeting today 
with egyptian foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid to try to settle 
a dispute over the palestine liberation organization 
the squabble is delaying the start of negotiations and could 
block implementation of an israeli plan for elections on the west 
bank and in gaza 
baker also plans to meet on thursday with israeli defense 
minister yitzhak rabin 
abdelmeguid accompanied by osama elbaz a key adviser to 
president hosni mubarak arrived in washington this morning and was 
expected to remain in the capital for several days 
rabin was due here after midnight from los angeles and will see 
defense secretary dick cheney on wednesday and baker and brent 
scowcroft the national security assistant to president bush on 
thursday 
whether the plo should play a role in negotiations if they 
ever get started is the main stumbling block as baker tries to 
launch stepbystep negotiations leading up to elections on the 
israeliheld west bank and in gaza 
baker has conducted most of his diplomacy by telephone to cairo 
and jerusalem it has left him frustrated and warning the parties 
that problems in other parts of the world were demanding his 
attention 
egypt the only arab nation to sign a peace treaty with israel 
is serving as a channel to yasser arafats plo in that mode egypt 
accepted with reservations last month an invitation from baker to a 
threeway meeting here with israel 
the reservations sought some plo control over palestinian 
participation further down the road israel meanwhile accepted 
the invitation with the condition that the plo which is sworn to 
israels dismantling as a jewish state be excluded from even an 
offstage role 
the clash over the plo has delayed setting a date for bakers 
threeway meeting with abdelmeguid and israeli foreign minister 
moshe arens 
there are many other areas in the world clamoring for his 
attention areas where the circumstances are producing change 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said last week 
we hope to see the same kind of impulse that will produce change 
in the middle east and were prepared to do all we can to promote 
it 
she added we have continued to try to make progress and lay 
the basis for a trilateral meeting if this effort does fail it 
certainly wont be due to a lack of effort or will on the part of 
this president bush or this secretary of state 
there is no indication however that the administration will 
try to exert pressure on israel by threatening to reduce us aid 
still senate republican leader bob dole today suggested 
reducing aid to israel egypt the philippines turkey and pakistan 
by 5 percent and diverting the money to countries such as poland 
hungary and panama 
to me it boils down to this are big gains for freedom worth 
a small cut in a few huge foreign aid programs i say yes dole 
wrote in a column in the new york times 
the unexpected trip by abdelmeguid and elbaz follows two 
visits to cairo in a week by arafat 
an egyptian foreign ministry spokesman said monday that the two 
officials are going to try and push forward middle east peace 
efforts with baker 
abdelmeguid also will hold talks with officials of the 
international monetary fund seeking easier terms for egypt a poor 
country with a booming population 
the plo insists that it must name and be seen to name the 
palestinian delegation to future talks with israel and that the 
agenda be open 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir is trying to confine the 
negotiations to the elections he has proposed for the 14 million 
palestinian arabs who live on the west bank and in gaza 
the elections are designed to produce a fiveyear experiment in 
limited selfrule which would be followed by broader negotiations 
the plo which seeks to take over the west bank and gaza and to 
establish a state carved out of israeli territory has denounced 
shamirs plan which has bakers backing as a ploy

more than 100 romanians demonstrated 
outside the us embassy to demand immigration visas 
our families have been ruined our future ruined because of 
our politics said cristin popescu a spokesman for the group 
which staged the protest monday 
popescu a 31yearold father of five said the demonstrators 
were still demanding to go to the united states as political 
refugees despite the overthrow of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
because it was their desire to leave romania that often brought on 
their troubles 
virginia young the embassys consulgeneral agreed the 
protestors had been caught in the middle since they suffered 
for trying to leave romania before the revolution but for one 
reason or another were not eligible under us immigration rules 
they lost jobs or schooling for their children because they 
asked for passports from the romanian government or had relatives 
in the united states mrs young said 
under ceausescus regime few romanians were allowed to leave 
even temporarily and it was illegal to talk to foreigners without 
permission 
mrs young said the embassy has been in contact with about 200 
families for up to two years who wanted to move to the united 
states but were not eligible 
the marchers whose backs bore signs saying american visa 
marched around the embassy in silence 
popescu the spokesman for the protesters said that despite 
ceausescus overthrow and the promise of free elections they still 
feared for their future 
we dont have trust a reevaluation needs a long time the 
communists have deep roots here said popescu 
he added that protesters also remained worried about the secret 
police we know security people whove not yet been dismissed 
he said 
popescu said the protesters were delighted that ambassador alan 
green jr agreed to meet with them but they still planned to 
demonstrate outside the embassy each week 
mrs young said green had agreed to pass along the groups 
concerns to washington but could make no promises they are a 
group that we have concerns about she said

and work blocked roads and clashed with mounted police in 
northern israel on tuesday after a pipe factory owned by the ailing 
koor conglomerate was closed 
burning tires and a bulldozer blocked the road outside hatzor 
haglilit a town of 7000 people eight miles north of the sea of 
galilee 
the protest followed the firing of 150 workers from the habonim 
pipe factory which is jointly owned by kibbutz kfar hanassi and 
koor 
koor an industrial conglomerate which employs 22000 workers 
and is owned by the histadrut trade union federation is threatened 
with liquidation and is selling off assets including some of its 
100 subsidiary companies

two buyout bids one by the usbased shamrock corp and the other 
from canadian financier mark belzberg 
the conglomerates chairman arnon gafny resigned monday in a 
dispute over how to save koor from liquidation and the board 
decided to stop all debt payments to israeli banks until next week 
koor spokesman amnon barnoy said the board acted as it did 
because of a shortage of cash and the hope that a comprehensive 
bailout agreement with the government and the banks would be 
reached by next week 
he said koor which at its height had 31000 workers and 150 
companies planned to either sell the pipe factory or close it for 
good 
the demonstrators clashed with a column of police reinforced 
with mounted officers and a special antiriot unit police moved in 
when protesters blocked the highway and arrested four 
criminal charges also were filed against a junior high school 
principle for allowing pupils to attend the demonstraiton said 
police assistant inspector yaacov ganot 
the head of the town council yossi elul told israel radio the 
demonstrations would continue until the jobs are returned 
we burned tires we closed the main road we traded punches 
but after all we are closing our own home he said 
hatzor is a development town a community created around small 
industry in the 1950s and settled by jews from arab countries many 
such towns are suffering high unemployment as the industries fail 
shlomo buchbut deputy chairman of the development town forum 
was quoted on israel radio as saying the government must help koor 
industries recover because its collapse would mean social unrest 
every week in a different development town

an illegitimate child is at the center of 
a legal tangle preventing the state from auctioning more than 
500000 in logging equipment confiscated from a drug trafficker 
robert slim hamilton 52 head of a narcotics ring broken up 
last year signed a court agreement a year ago before he was 
sentenced to 50 years in prison to provide 420000 for support of 
the child he says is his 
but prosecutors say hamilton signed the agreement to avoid 
having his property seized under a 1983 law that allows authorities 
to confiscate assets used in drug operations or bought with drug 
profits 
the district attorneys office is challenging the agreement in 
court 
the assets include bulldozers flatbed trailers pickup trucks 
a tool truck three other large trucks and logloading equipment 
between hamiltons indictment and conviction a woman claimed in 
court that he was the father of her child and asked for child 
support hamilton agreed he was the father and consented to provide 
420000 in past present and future support 
the districts attorney office is asking that a judge declare 
the agreement invalid because it was done to protect his assets 
no hearing date is set on that motion

an activist group asked a court tuesday to 
implement a 1988 judgment ordering union carbide corp to pay 147 
million as interim compensation to victims of the 1984 bhopal gas 
disaster 
a petition filed in bhopal district court by the poisonous gas 
episode struggle front demanded implementation of an april 4 1988 
order issued by the madhya pradesh state high court at jabalpur 
that case had originated in the district court at bhopal the 
capital of madhya pradesh and the site of a massive gas leak on 
dec 3 1984 from a pesticide plant run by union carbides indian 
subsidiary 
at least 3598 people were fatally injured and 20000 others 
suffered ill effects from the methyl isocynate gas that spewed from 
the factory yards away from shantytowns housing tens of thousands 
of people 
vibhuti jha the fronts lawyer said the petition sought the 
implementation of the high court order for 147 million in interim 
relief jha said the relief order was now worth about 198 million 
because of accrued interest 
the bhopal district court took no immediate action on the 
petition 
it was not clear if the petition was vaild because all previous 
and prospective damages suits were anulled by a settlement approved 
by the indian supreme court on feb 14 1989 
union carbide had deposited the settlement amount with the 
supreme court in compensation for the disaster but the money has 
not been distributed because of various challenges 
the settlement had been concluded by union carbide and the 
former government of rajiv gandhi last week the new government of 
prime minister vp singh said it backed victims claims that the 
compensation amount was too small 
gas victims and activists charged that gandhi government had no 
right to declare itself the sole representative of all claims and 
that the settlement itself was unfair 
on dec 22 the supreme court ruled that the government did have 
the right to be the claimants sole representative the claim that 
the settlement was unfair is still pending before the supreme court 
in new delhi 
union carbide said monday the settlement remains binding even 
though the new indian government has disavowed it there is 
simply no basis for overturning it joseph e geoghan union 
carbide vice president and general counsel said at the companys 
headquarters in danbury conn 
at least 500000 people have asked for compensation according 
to madhya pradesh state officials processing the claims

too much cruising along the modesto strip 
that inspired george lucas to film american graffiti has led 
city officials to propose banning it 
city officials have drafted ordinances that would prevent anyone 
from driving by certain checkpoints along mchenry avenue more than 
once in four hours another ordinance would make it illegal to 
loiter at night along streets in this city 90 miles southeast of 
san francisco 
the ordinances which have not yet come before the city council 
were spurred by police chief gerald mckenzie saying up to 5000 
cars cruise mchenry some evenings 
the threat of civil unrest is very real and demands our 
attention and best efforts to avert a disaster mckenzie wrote 
the city manager 
lucas who grew up in modesto based american graffiti on a 
fictional night in 1962 of cruising 10th street and mchenry avenue 
lucas is famous for the star wars trilogy

sen rudy boschwitz clambered up the creaking 
stairs he last walked down as a toddler when his family fled the 
nazis 56 years ago 
revisiting the berlin house in which his parents lived until he 
was nearly 3 boschwitz recalled the day of jan 30 1933 
the same day my father came home and told my mother we would 
leave the minnesota republican said tuesday and we went 
within six months 
boschwitz said the trigger for returning to his birthplace was 
the opening of the berlin wall 
ive never been back he said with the reunification for 
many practical purposes of the city and maybe because im getting 
a little older i had a yen to take a look at my roots 
he and his parents both polishborn jews fled berlin for 
czechoslovakia in the summer of 1933 and ended up in new york 
where boschwitz spent the first three decades of his life 
while boschwitz 59 tried to piece together memories from his 
berlin days the past was vivid for frank schiff a childhood 
friend who lived in the same house and whom boschwitz met again by 
chance years later 
it looks very familiar schiff said once inside the 
1915vintage art deco apartment building 
the house on busy hohenzollerndamm avenue is in what is now a 
west berlin residential area that emerged relatively unscathed from 
fierce fighting at the end of world war ii 
it was very pleasant here before the hitler period said 
schiff a 68yearold retired economist from alexandria va a 
german jew he too was uprooted and fled with his family to the 
united states in 1936 
boschwitz returned on a rainy day to a city that was extensively 
rebuilt after the war its a nice place was his first 
impression 
west german businessman eberhard naundorf and his wife 
christine said they were glad to welcome boschwitz back into the 
apartment they now rent 
the war has created so many people who try to find their 
roots said mrs naundorf herself of polishgerman descent 
on a fourday trip to germany boschwitz visited the berlin wall 
after arriving monday he chipped out a few pieces 
east germany opened the wall along with its other western 
borders on nov 9 under massive pressure from street demonstrators 
and an exodus of tens of thousands of its citizens 
in a sign of the changing times boschwitz was due to meet east 
german foreign minister oskar fischer and opposition groups and 
tour east berlin he also will meet with minnesota soldiers 
stationed in west berlin

a judge in a landmark housing discrimination case 
approved a settlement today that will allow construction of a group 
home for retarded people in suburban chicago heights 
us district judge william t hart approved a consent agreement 
requiring the suburb to issue a previously denied permit for 
construction of the home by residential facilities management 
services inc of galesburg 
the city while not admitting to any discrimination also agreed 
to pay 45000 in damages 30000 to rfms for construction delays 
and 1000 to each of the 15 people who will eventually live in the 
home 
the agreement settles lawsuits filed last summer by rfms and the 
us justice department under a fair housing act amendment passed 
in march barring discrimination against the handicapped 
at issue was a may 1 vote by chicago heights city council 
denying the permit for the home the lawsuits contended the city 
council was motivated by opposition from residents fearful of and 
prejudiced against the retarded 
the justice department lawsuit was the first case brought by the 
government under the fair housing amendment 
our hope is that this agreement will be noted by other 
communities not only in the chicago metropolitan area of illinois 
but nationwide that its impermissible for them to deny access to 
living accomodations on behalf of developmentally disabled 
persons said richard e friedman attorney for rfms the company 
operates 55 group homes in 35 other illinois communities 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the 
settlement may make it easier for the government to obtain court 
orders in future cases involving the refusal of local governments 
to grant permits for group homes 
department lawyers were considering legal action elsewhere as 
well but chose to await the results of the chicago heights case 
she said the settlement should also encourage cities to comply 
with federal law she said 
chicago heights maintained the permit was denied because rfms 
had not supplied necessary documents with its application 
the fact that the inhabitants happened to be developmentally 
disabled was not a factor said the suburbs attorney nick j di 
giovanni 
under the agreement the company pledged that the home will not 
be used to care for mentally ill or emotionally disturbed patients 
we hope other communities will get the message that the 
handicapped have rights under the fair housing act said james p 
turner acting head of the justice departments civil rights 
division if local officials dont pay attention to those rights 
they will pay damages for violating them 
turner credited chicago heights officials with seeing that it 
was not in the citys best interests to continue fighting this 
lawsuit

barbara bush said today she thinks women 
should be allowed to serve in combat if they are physically strong 
enough because certainly emotionally and mentally they are more 
than able to compete with a man 
mrs bush answered with a qualified yes when asked in an 
interview whether women should serve in combat 
if i thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was 
wounded and carry them to safety if i thought they could throw a 
hand grenade as far as a man then i would say fine because i 
think certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to 
compete with a man 
they can shoot as well they can fly as well the only problem 
i would have is if it risks somebody elses life because they 
couldnt throw a hand grenade as far or carry someone that would 
be the only thing 
president bush has said he would be willing to listen to 
recommendations from the pentagon about the possibility of women 
serving in combat but that the women who fought in panama were not 
in combat roles 
in the us panama invasion women were not assigned to combat 
units but some found themselves under fire in performing support 
duties 
the first lady also said she helped bush keep the invasion of 
panama secret she said she was told about it the day of the 
invasion before it happened but i knew something was going on 
a few days ahead because of all the presidential advisers who were 
coming and going from the white house 
when deposed gen manuel antonio noriega finally surrendeered to 
us forces after several tense days in the vatican embassy in 
panama city mrs bush said the president came racing through and 
said we got him 
id say he was pleased pleased that it was over without more 
bloodshed she said 
she said she has been a little testy about all the letters 
she receives from people who dont think its safe for the 
president to attend the upcoming drug summit in violencetorn 
colombia 
she said she would prefer that the summit be elsewhere i 
wish it would be right here but i cant change his mind or 
make those decisions i have no input on that 
asked about her health mrs bush said she was cautiously 
optimistic that her recent series of radiation treatments would 
cure the irritated eyes and double vision she suffers as a result 
of graves disease an immune system disorder 
she said she still is having trouble but that im so eager to 
be better that i think im better

three parents who let their daughters 
skip school for a rock concert have volunteered to serve detention 
time in the principals office in place of their children 
im 33 years old and im taking my first detention ever 
chris thompson said everyone ive told this to thinks its the 
funniest thing they ever heard 
mrs thompson her husband paul and a neighbor colleen 
lupiezowiec said they will serve their daughters detention time 
wednesday when the students are off from school because of an 
administrative day 
they said they allowed their daughters junior high school 
students to take a day off so they could attend a concert in 
milwaukee by new kids on the block 
the concert was not scheduled to begin until 7 pm but ms 
lupiezowiec said she and the children left in the early afternoon 
because she had business to conduct in milwaukee about 70 east 
mrs thompson says her daughter melissa was home sick in the 
morning but went to the concert anyway i think she would have 
left if she had the plague she was that excited about it she 
said 
michael buehler superintendent of cambridge schools said the 
pupils would have been excused if they and their parents had told 
the school the truth instead the daughters were given detentions 
but school officials agreed to let the parents serve the time 
the parents came up with a novel idea that shows 
accountability and being a good role model means owning up when you 
do something wrong or dont use the best of judgment buehler 
said 
ms lupiezowiec said she will sit in principal lowell holtzs 
office for 7 hours 3 hours for each for her two daughters

carroll witten has gotten a memento of 
his days as a world war ii prisoner of war from an east german 
family thanks to the historic opening of the berlin wall 
in 1945 a year after his b17 bomber was shot down over 
germany witten and about 40 other pows were being marched from 
poland to a pow camp at bad muskau near the germanpolish border 
during an overnight stop at a barn witten lost his brass pow 
identification tag 
he had all but forgotten the tag until he got a call from berlin 
last month 
on the sunday after the berlin wall was opened on nov 9 an 
east german family visiting west berlin for the first time 
approached us army capt james allen and gave him a tarnished 
brass tag 
the tag bore only a fourdigit pow number and the words oflag 
luft 3 a designation for a prison camp for air officers 
allen said the family told him they had found the tag in the 
rubble of their old barn which had burned in 1988 
using red cross archives allen traced the number to witten now 
65 
witten said allen telephoned him in early december from berlin 
and that when asked he could clearly remember his prisoner number 
i said sure i couldnt forget it 4854 witten said 
he said youre the guy 
just before christmas allen routed himself through louisville 
on a flight from west germany and gave witten the longlost tag 
it was a funny feeling when i held this tag in my hand 
again witten reflected unbelievable 
witten said allen has promised to get the exact address of the 
family who found the tag so he can get in touch with them 
i want to write them and id like to go back to germany 
maybe in a year and see them he said

two plainclothes british soldiers who foiled a 
weekend robbery in belfast left behind three bodies and a tangle of 
questions did they give a warning why were they there to what 
unit did they belong 
most crucially witnesses claimed the soldiers kept firing after 
the masked robbers lay wounded on the sidewalk and once again the 
british government was denying that its forces in northern ireland 
have orders to shoot to kill 
i find it hard to believe that reasonable force was used 
the rev paddy mcwilliams said tuesday at the funeral one of the 
victims 
there is no shoottokill policy for the security forces in 
northern ireland said brian mawhinney a highranking british 
official in the province the only people who are conducting a 
shoottokill policy in the province are terrorists 
such allegations go back to 1982 when six people were killed in 
three separate police operations over a threeweek period all were 
unarmed although five were acknowledged to be guerrillas 
in 1987 three irish republican army members were gunned down in 
gibraltar while plotting a car bombing 
both incidents were followed by charges of coverups the human 
rights group amnesty international told the british government last 
year that official secrecy and lack of prosecutions would 
contribute to allegations of official involvement in deliberate 
planned killings 
in the incident saturday witnesses and police agreed that two 
of the slain robbers appeared to be armed and wore black ski masks 
also used by ira gunmen 
their guns proved to be nonworking replicas of a mauser 
submachinegun and a bruni handgun the third victim who was shot 
as he sat in a stolen getaway car was not masked or armed 
authorities have not identified the two soldiers nor have they 
said whether any warning was given there has been no official 
response to claims that two of the victims were shot as they lay on 
the sidewalk 
the government wont even identify the soldiers unit which is 
believed to be an elite surveillance group 
the royal ulster constabulary the provinces police force said 
the soldiers came across the incident by chance 
what precisely happened next and why is properly the subject 
of the investigation now being rigorously pursued by the ruc 
peter brooke the top british official in northern ireland told 
the house of commons on monday 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing claimed saturday 
there had been intensive security force operations in the area the 
day before the shootings press association britains domestic 
news agency said tuesday that government sources had confirmed 
reports by witnesses that two more soldiers were at the scene 
the ruc said tuesday it had arrested a fourth robbery suspect 
who reportedly hid in the betting shop and slipped away before 
police arrived 
the dead men all had criminal records edward paul hale 21 who 
was buried tuesday had two convictions he had also been shot in 
the elbows knees and ankles by the ira in 1987 for antisocial 
actions 
peter james thompson 21 the other masked man had a record of 
six convictions and the man in the car joseph mcneil 42 had 28 
convictions police said 
within hours of the incident sinn fein president gerry adams 
issued a statement accusing the security forces of coldblooded 
murder 
spokesmen for the social democratic and labor party the largest 
mainly roman catholic party in northern ireland also called the 
shootings unjustified the irish government is demanding an 
explanation 
defenders of the security forces said the incident had to be 
seen in the context of northern irelands intractable strife 
security officers do not get a second chance from the ira and 
it must be considered a reasonable action on the part of security 
forces when confronting those who present themselves as armed to 
safeguard lives by shooting them said peter robinson deputy 
leader of the rev ian paisleys democratic unionist party 
in two decades 870 members of the army the ruc and the ulster 
defense regiment have been killed in northern ireland 
john stalker an english police official assigned to investigate 
the 1982 killings recommended prosecuting 11 ruc officials and 
instead was removed from the case 
he said he reached no conclusion about the existence of a 
shoottokill policy but said in 1988 that the circumstances 
pointed to a police inclination if not a policy to shoot 
suspects dead without warning rather than to arrest them

pamphlets claiming whites will 
be wiped out by aids unless they isolate themselves from blacks 
have been condemned by medical experts as a rightwing plot to 
create public hysteria 
hundreds of the facts on aids pamphlets have been 
distributed in areas around johannesburg recently by a group urging 
whites to save the white race from extinction aids experts say 
the pamphlets are completely misleading and are intended to create 
fear and racial tension 
police said tuesday the pamphlets had not caused any problems 
and they could not take action against the unknown authors because 
no public complaints had been received 
we could not do anything until there was evidence it was 
subvertng public morals a police spokesman said 
the pamphlets claim that aids can be spread by casual contact 
including via toilet seats swimming pools multiracial churches 
multiracial hotels and distribution of communion wafers during 
church services 
the pamphlets appeared at a time when the south african 
government is moving to desegregate some public facilities as part 
of its stated aim of ending apartheid many whites strongly oppose 
the attempts to end desegregation in public facilities 
dr dennnis sifris a senior aids specialist at johannesburg 
hospital said the pamphlet was ridiculous and completely 
misleading 
its obviously put out by an extreme lunatic fringe group who 
are trying to scare everyone he said 
the threepage pamphlets produced by a previously unknown group 
called the aids information distributing society claim many south 
african blacks have acquired immune deficiency syndrome and whites 
must protect themselves from infection 
whites are urged to avoid areas where the races mingle such as 
integrated hotels and churches and to have black servants tested 
each month to ensure they do not have aids 
the south african government used to claim that the african 
national congress the main black political movement was bringing 
aids into the country when its infected guerrillas infiltrated 
across the border the claims have been dropped as the government 
has taken a more moderate position on dealing with the anc 
professor ruben sher head of the south african medical research 
councils aids center said the pamphlets make erroneous claims 
including assertions that aids is spread by casual contact and 
through mosquito bites 
sher also criticized the pamphlets suggestion that whites make 
their black servants take regular monthly tests to ensure they do 
not have aids this is a blatant racial slur sher said 
johannesburg newspapers said nothing was known about the group 
behind the pamphlets 
south africa has reported about 300 aids cases among whites 
with an unknown number of people afflicted by the human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
although no firm statistics are available aids is thought to be 
more widespread among blacks reflecting the major spread of the 
disease among heterosexuals in some other african nations 
scientists say aids is spread by sexual intercourse through 
contaminated blood or syringe needles and through infected mothers 
to unborn children

more than 100000 ethnic germans plan 
to emigrate from romania to west germany despite the fall of 
dictator nicolae ceausescu west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher said tuesday 
genscher met monday and tuesday with leaders of the ethnic 
german community and he said they told him that between 60 percent 
and 80 percent of romanias 220000 ethnic germans would take 
advantage of the lifting of emigration restrictions enforced by the 
ceausescu regime 
the ethnic germans as well as other minority groups like the 
hungarians and serbs were persecuted under ceausescus forced 
assimilation policy 
since 1978 bonn has paid an average of about 5900 to the 
romanian government for each of about 130000 ethnic germans 
allowed to emigrate to west germany 
most of the germans in romania are descendants of immigrants 
from the german provinces of swabia and saxony who settled in the 
rich farming lands of what is now romania starting in the 13th 
century 
genscher said monday that about 80 percent of romanias germans 
had applied for exit visas during the ceausescu years 
during his trip to romania genscher has stressed the importance 
of the governing national salvation front council quickly creating 
trust among minority groups in democratic developments and ending 
discrimination against the german ethnic minority 
genscher said that although the west german government wants the 
living conditions of the germans improved germany would welcome 
any who wanted to emigrate

gov mario cuomo unveiling a 513 billion 
state budget today called for about 700 million in higher taxes 
and fees and proposed that new yorkers forgo a promised income tax 
cut in 199091 
cuomo a secondterm democrat considered a potential 1992 
presidential contender said new york needs the extra money to deal 
with budget deficits and combat drug abuse and aids 
new yorks tax revenue has been hurt by earlier tax cuts and an 
economic slowdown in the northeast he said 
under his spending plan the overall budget would grow 93 
percent included in his proposal for additional revenue was a call 
for an increase in the cigarette tax of 5 cents a pack to 38 cents 
in october the states maximum income tax rate is scheduled to 
drop from 75 percent to 7 percent unless cuomo gets his way with 
or without the drop new yorks rates would still be the highest in 
the northeast 
republicans and business leaders have argued that the final 
phase of the fouryear tax cut approved by cuomo and the 
legislature in 1987 must be preserved liberal democrats and social 
service advocates have said the state needs the money 
the final phase of the tax cut would translate into a savings of 
134 this year for a family of four with two wage earners and an 
annual taxable income of 50000 according to state officials 
freezing the tax cut could provide the state treasury with an 
extra 400 million for the fiscal year that begins april 1

the kremlin today sent thousands of reinforcements 
to enforce a state of emergency in parts of the southern caucasus 
where fierce battles raged between hundreds of wellarmed 
azerbaijanis and armenians 
at least 56 people have been killed and 156 injured in ethnic 
strife in the republic of azerbaijan since thursday interior 
ministry spokesman vladimir a yanchenkov said today 
yanchenkov told a briefing that authorities had recorded 167 
pogroms and cases of arson civilians mostly armenians are 
said to have been murdered at random in ethnically motivated 
attacks that provoked the gun battles 
soviet tv reported tonight that more than 5000 soviet army 
soldiers and 6000 internal security troops had been dispatched as 
reinforcements to the disputed region of nagornokarabakh in 
azerbaijan and in the neighboring republic of armenia 
president mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet presidium 
proclaimed a state of emergency monday night empowering the 
government to use units of the soviet army navy and kgb to put 
down the ethnic unrest it was not known how many troops were sent 
to the region since ethnic clashes began saturday 
the official news agency tass said 2000 people armed with 
antiaircraft guns and other artillery today were massed on hills 
around the disputed region 
we cant bring ourselves to pronounce it aloud but what is 
happening now in karabakh in northern azerbaijan can be termed 
unambiguously a civil war correspondent o shapovalov wrote in 
the youth daily komsomolskaya pravda 
others likened the bloodletting to the combat of world war ii 
the soviet interior ministry reported that armed bands had 
seized grenades and machine guns from military posts and had 
commandeered armored vehicles and helicopters 
news reports described open armed clashes in the region 
with 300 gunmen fighting in one battle and trenches being dug and 
other fortifications built to defend villages from attack 
foreign reporters were not allowed into the region 
soviet media reported anarchy in many areas with combatants 
taking hostages and said government troops trying to get to areas 
of combat were being delayed by crowds of people who were blocking 
roads 
the state of emergency empowers local officials to ban 
demonstrations and strikes impose curfews censor the media 
confiscate weapons and disband unofficial organizations 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters 
the measures were aimed only at protecting people and had no 
political overtones 
i would not interpret this step as being at odds with glasnost 
and democracy he told a briefing on the contrary the step 
opposes anarchy 
in washington white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the declaration was necessary we understand the need to 
establish order in a situation where order has broken down he 
said 
the flareup is the most violent between mainly moslem 
azerbaijanis and mostly christian armenians since their decadesold 
feud over the nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan erupted in 
bloody clashes two years ago 
the predominantly armenian region has been ruled by azerbaijan 
since 1923 
turkey said today that its armed forces had tightened security 
along the countrys border with the soviet union it did not 
elaborate the soviet azerbaijanis are a turkishspeaking ethnic 
group with close cultural and historical ties to turkey 
azerbaijanis were said today to be continuing a virtual rail 
blockade of armenias 35 million people cutting short fuel and 
other supplies 
the official tass news agency said the state of emergency means 
regular red army units and kgb troops now will be used to protect 
residents of the strifetorn area and vital installations like 
railroads 
detachments of security troops today patrolled baku the 
azerbaijani capital where the violence exploded saturday night with 
an antiarmenian riot and armored personnel carriers moved through 
the suburbs activist alesker siyabov said by telephone 
about 400000 armenians rallied monday in yerevan the capital 
of their republic and groups of young men were volunteering to go 
off and fight the azerbaijanis an one editor at the armenian news 
agency armenpress said today 
gorbachev on sunday sent highlevel troubleshooters and 
additional troops to the mountainous region 1240 miles southeast 
of moscow to try to end the fighting in azerbaijan a republic of 
69 million people 
moscowbased foreign correspondents were told monday by foreign 
ministry officials they would not be permitted to travel to 
azerbaijan or armenia 
tass said armenians and azerbaijanis with submachine guns were 
waging open armed clashes in azerbaijans khanlar region near 
nagornokarabakh in the nearby shaumyan region 300 gunmen fought 
in one battle tv news said 
the government newspaper izvestia said the belligerents were 
using helicopters without markings and armored vehicles captured 
from military bases 
izvestia said at least 33 people had died in antiarmenian 
rampages in baku a caspian sea port of 17 million and 
oilproducing center but that the figure could rise tass said 
2000 armenians were evacuated by ferry and plane from the city and 
that of the capitals 220000 residents only a few thousand 
remained 
gorbachevs greater tolerance for dissent has encouraged many 
soviet ethnic groups to make demands they long suppressed but that 
has often led to violent conflict in the nation of more than 100 
nationalities many of whom harbor ageold grudges 
the last major rioting sparked by the nagornokarabakh feud was 
in february 1988 when azerbaijanis attacked armenians in sumgait 
near baku thirtytwo people died most of them armenians 
more than 200 have since been reported killed

the grandson of mohandas gandhi says the 
us civil rights movement lost direction after the assassination 
of martin luther king jr as its leaders settled for equal legal 
status for minorities 
arun manilal gandhi said monday that king dreamed of a society 
in which people were judged by character rather than skin color and 
everyone lived together in harmony 
but equality under the law is vastly different because people 
can be considered equal but remain separate he said 
thats the great tragedy of the movement here gandhi said 
in comments at a conference called erasing racism at lakeland 
college it got waylaid and settled for equality under the law 
he said king understood and practiced the nonviolent philosophy 
that his grandfather who helped free india from british control 
through nonviolent resistance was trying to teach the world 
he said there is not a single place in the world where racism 
prejudice and hatred did not exist 
its very sad gandhi said but it doesnt mean we cant 
do something about it 
gandhi 56 is working with the university of mississippis 
center for the study of southern culture in oxford miss

the revolution reached chilly 
university classrooms tuesday with students demanding the firing of 
professors regarded more for their knowledge of communism than of 
physics or chemistry 
notices pasted on doorways at bucharests polytechnic university 
called for required military courses for women to be dropped and 
for student votes on the competency of teachers students also 
demanded an end to required courses on marxism 
in dormitories students sought to get rid of residents 
suspected of having informed for the deposed government 
the fervent debates on student rights were reminiscent of the 
united states in the 1960s when college students demonstrated for 
more control over what they were taught and by whom 
but the romanian students meetings and petitions also mirrored 
the string of public denunciations that have arisen since dictator 
nicolae ceaucescu was overthrown dec 22 
newspapers have denounced everyone in turn from ceausescu to 
the interim leaders and in one case even the head of a small farm 
cooperative accused of buying a university diploma with 200 pigs 
in the polytechnics physics department students were signing 
petitions tuesday to demand the ouster of a professor named ilie 
cucurezeanu 
in his lectures he started by explaining communist ideology 
but he couldnt explain physics said daniel florescu a 
secondyear student from bucharest 
roxana mitroi 20 from romanian moldavia said cucurezeanu 
often asked students who gave incorrect answers what kind of 
communist are you 
florescu 22 said the secondyear physics students had met with 
the department dean who promised to cooperate with them 
dean juliet floria said she told students she would submit their 
request for cucurezeanu dissmisal to the faculty along with a 
suggestion that his upcoming exam for secondyear students be 
reviewed by a professorial committee 
it will be up to the faculty to decide she said but added 
the students demands have to be addressed 
cucurezeanu took another view we dont have to bend our ears 
to students talk he said 
wrapped in a coat and scarf in his sparsely heated office 
cucurezeanu denied he infused his courses with talk of communism 
and offered to produce documents from the ministry of education 
issued under the ousted regime testifying to his credentials 
he maintained only secondyear students wanted him fired because 
theyd become caught up in last months revolution and had not 
studied enough for his exam 
until now i never had problems with students he said 
however hundreds of signatures on the petitions were from 
thirdand fourthyear students not facing cucurezeanus exam 
students said that in other departments of polytechnic a 
sprawling campus with nearly 30000 students efforts also were 
under way to dismiss professors viewed as incompetent or communist 
party apparatchiks 
at bucharest university students were making similar moves 
there are factions in the language department for and against the 
firing of michaela ceausescu a niece of the late dictator as a 
professor of russian the issue has been submitted to the central 
administration for a decision 
at polytechnic student sorin popao said dormitories were 
organizing to get rid of suspected informers often nonstudents 
who lived in the dorms as administrators or staff 
in my dorm we confronted two of them in the hall last 
night said popao 22 of the town of baia mare 
it started with a couple of us and one of them said no not 
me you people are the informers popao said 
but he said when a crowd gathered the same person said 
the police called me and asked for information what could i do 
florescu said one major demand was getting rid of the political 
content of such courses as history politics and economics and 
dropping the required course on marxist philosophy 
this marxist philosophy should be replaced by optional courses 
on politics that havent been taught here for 40 or 45 years he 
said we dont know anything about practical politics about 
democracy its a national problem 
asked if there was anything else the students wanted florescu 
thought for a moment and said with a chuckle a mcdonalds

the supreme court was urged tuesday to help 
consumers and to foster business competition by allowing states and 
private citizens to use federal antitrust law to break up corporate 
mergers 
the california attorney generals office argued that the clayton 
act passed in 1914 when congress was preoccupied with trust 
busting on a national scale empowers the state to challenge a 25 
billion merger of the lucky and alpha beta supermarket chains 
less competition in the industry leading to higher grocery 
bills for consumers will result from the merger said deputy 
california attorney general h chester horn jr 
the injury threatened by this merger is precisely the one the 
clayton act was designed to prevent he said 
but rex e lee representing the supermarket chains said only 
the federal government is empowered by the 1914 law to force 
divestiture in a completed merger 
justice sandra day oconnor said most of these mergers are 
handled before a state or private person knows the acquisition is 
taking place 
she asked lee whether he believed therefore that states and 
individuals would be powerless under federal law to break up such 
mergers 
that is exactly what congress intended lee replied it is 
is the change in status we are talking about from two independent 
companies to a unified structure he said 
breaking up the structure is something the federal 
government can do and no one else lee said 
lucky californias largest supermarket chain and alpha beta 
the fourth largest operate 550 stores between them 
alpha betas parent company american stores acquired lucky in 
june 1988 to merge the two chains under the lucky name 
american stores said california customers would save more than 
40 million a year because of increased efficiency but the 
california attorney generals office said the merger will mean less 
competition and will lead to 440 million in higher prices each 
year 
us district judge david kenyon in los angeles temporarily 
blocked the merger in 1988 and ordered continued separate operation 
of the two chains pending further court action 
but the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
ruling 
the appeals court said the state had it moved quickly enough 
could have prevented the merger but the appeals court said only 
the federal government has the power to break up completed mergers 
the federal trade commission temporarily blocked the acquisition 
in 1988 but later reached an agreement with the corporations 
allowing the deal as long as certain conditions were met 
much of the hourlong arguments before the high court tuesday 
focused on the intentions of the clayton acts drafters 76 years 
ago 
lee referred to testimony before a congressional committee by 
louis d brandeis a lawyer who represented president wilsons 
administration two years before brandeis was appointed to the 
supreme court 
brandeis made it clear the administration was proposing 
legislation that would give the federal government and no one else 
power to dissolve a merger lee said 
but horn argued that brandeis and the congressmen were 
discussing a much different bill than the one that was introduced 
and became the clayton act 
brandeis was saying only that the power to attack the 
nationwide trusts belonged in the hands of the federal 
government not other corporate mergers horn said 
the case is california vs american stores 89258

it will be difficult to restrain congress from 
making deep unilateral troop cuts that outpace progress on a 
european conventional arms treaty a senior member of the house 
armed services committee said tuesday 
im convinced that a farreaching conventional armscontrol 
agreement is within reach this year rep ike skelton dmo 
said after returning from 10 days of talks with allied arms 
negotiators and others in europe 
the worst thing we can do is to have a unilateral force cut 
this year he said if we give the store away why will the 
soviets want to destroy 40000 tanks they wont want to 
skelton said there will be an attempt in congress to declare 
that the cold war is over this year 
but uncertainty is just as much an enemy as the warsaw pact 
is skelton said adding that the united states must undertake 
a deliberate builddown of its forces that rests on verifiable 
arms control agreements with the soviet union not a unilateral 
force reduction 
skelton and a group of committee members met in brussels with 
nato commander gen john galvin and in vienna with ambassador r

the ruling communist party in a 
concession to the countrys fledgling opposition agreed tuesday to 
allow democratic groups to publish their own newspaper and said 
they would be granted offices in sofia 
but it rejected a demand for opposition access to radio and 
television which would take democratic ideas across this largely 
rural nation 
the compromise was fashioned after the opposition threatened to 
withdraw from talks with the communists that many hope will hasten 
bulgarias faltering transition to democracy 
more than 50000 people attended one of the biggest 
anticommunist demonstrations in bulgarian history on sunday to 
back the oppositions demands for more democracy the 
demonstration organized at two days notice testified to slowly 
growing popular support for opposition groups still banned just 
three months ago 
petko simeonov a leader of the union of democratic forces an 
umbrella organization of 12 opposition parties and groups angrily 
accused the communists of stalling on demands first raised in 
november for an independent daily newspaper and for sofia 
headquarters to enable the growing but still weak opposition to 
organize 
for many years we know what it means when we dont get an 
answer simeonov told the communists seated across the table in 
the west hall of the national parliament 
our slogans and our ideas do not reach everybody we want what 
we have to say to be heard by everyone simeonov said 
access to the media is important in bulgaria which is isolated 
from western and all east bloc broadcasts but soviet ones and 
whose staterun media continue to run vitriolic attacks on 
opposition figures in an attempt to discredit them with the public 
the opposition won agreement on the daily newspaper which it 
hopes will have a print run of some 50000 copies 
opposition spokesman georgi spassov declined to say who would 
write for it or exactly when it would start to appear as the 
countrys first independent daily since the communists repressed 
all opposition in 1947 
the disarray that marked the talks was played out for an hour in 
front of bulgarian and foreign journalists and illustrated the 
difficulties of east europeans trying to move from totalitarian 
rule to more democracy without tools basic for the transition 
spassov noted that almost all buildings in bulgaria are 
controlled by the state thus putting the opposition in the 
position of begging the authorities for office space and a 
telephone 
plainly speaking we cannot exist simeonov told the 
communists 
he asked how the opposition could be members of the negotiations 
when we have no way of meeting to discuss things beforehand the 
conditions are unfavorable as if on purpose 
andrei lukanov the powerful and politically skilled no 2 to 
communist party chief and president petar mladenov argued the 
ruling party had done all it could to provide offices and 
newsprint he said matters were no longer in the communists hands 
i dont think you should be so suspicious he said with a 
smile to the opposition many of whom were jailed for months or 
years by the communists 
the two sides eventually reached agreement during a closeddoor 
session 
although the oppositions demand for live radio and television 
broadcast of the talks and direct access to the electronic media 
was rejected long excerpts of the session were shown on the 
evening tv news 
according to a tentative schedule the talks are supposed to 
discuss the transition to democracy and the free elections mladenov 
has promised by may the talks are scheduled to resume thursday 
the opposition seeks twostage legislative elections in may and 
november arguing they wont have enough time or resources to 
organize an adequate campaign against the communists by may 
the communists meanwhile seem to be trying to preserve as much 
power as possible hoping they can avoid the massive loss in 
authority suffered by their comrades everywhere else in eastern 
europe 
at least three recognizable factions have formed inside the 
communist party which on jan 30 holds a national congress that 
reformers hope will see the final purge of orthodox loyalists 
supporting todor zhivkov the hardline communist leader ousted 
nov 10 after 35 years in power 
some analysts believe the communists are encouraging the 
formation of reformist factions in order to attract more votes 
diplomats who asked not to be identified say the opposition is 
growing fast as well with the social democratic party among the 
fastest growing groups 
most of the social democrats leaders were jailed and some even 
killed by the communists in the late 1940s but in a never 
explained oversight the party was not banned and is said to be 
attracting tens of thousands of new members

some major corporations are making significant 
cuts in their use of three ozonedestroying chemicals but the 
vast majority of companies have yet to take any concrete steps to 
phase them out a private environmental group said tuesday 
the natural resources defense council produced industry figures 
showing that more than 200 million pounds of the three chemicals 
which are primarily used as metalcleaning solvents had been 
released into the atmosphere by more than 3000 companies in 1987 
the figures were the latest comprehensive ones available 
responses to questionnaires sent by the group by more than 300 
companies indicate that while some large polluters have reduced 
their use of the chemicals and emissions others have not 
their delays threaten the health and safety of all 
americans maintained david doniger an attorney for the 
washingtonbased environmental group 
the chemicals examined by the group are methyl chloroform and 
cfc113 both of which are widely used by electronics computer and 
aerospace industries as metalcleaning solvents and carbon 
tetrachloride used in the united states primarily in the 
manufacture of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs 
the three chemicals are among those that when released can drift 
high into the atmosphere where the chlorine component reacts with 
the earths protective ozone layer destroying the ozone past 
emissions of the three chemicals currently account for more than a 
third of the chlorine attacking the ozone layer which protects the 
earth from ultraviolet rays 
government and industry have acknowleged that the cfcs 
including cfc113 used as a solvent and carbon tetrachloride should 
be phased out and expect their elimination by the middle or latter 
part of the decade 
but methyl chloroform whose potency for ozone destruction is 
less than 15 percent that of cfcs remains unregulated and is 
viewed by much of industry as a potential bridge chemical as 
companies stop using cfcs as cleaning solvents 
methyl chloroform is part of the solution to the depletion of 
stratospheric ozone not part of the problem argued keith 
mckennon president of dow chemical usa in a letter to the 
environmental group 
dow manufactures about half of the methyl chloroform produced in 
the united states two other leading manufacturers ppg industries 
inc and vulcan chemical corp made similar arguments saying 
the chemical should not be banned from use 
but environmentalists contend that while the poundforpound 
destructiveness of methyl chloroform may be far less than cfcs the 
chemicals widespread use causes it to be of equal concern 
it is part of the problem doniger said at a news 
conference arguing that without curbs on methyl chloroform use 
you cant get the chlorine reductions needed after the year 
2000 to reverse the destruction of the ozone layer 
decisions made in the boardrooms of these companies using the 
chemicals will determine whether we succeed or fail in preventing 
the first truly global environmental catastrophe doniger 
continued 
some major users of the ozonedepleting chemicals have begun to 
make sizeable cuts in the use of the three chemicals however 
according to figures provided by the group 
for example pratt amp whitney the aircraft engine manufacturer 
in east hartford conn was reported to release 19 million pounds 
of methyl chloroform more than any other facility in 1987 but 
reported cutting emissions to 420000 pounds in 1988 
ibm corp one of the biggest users of cfc113 three years ago 
cut its emissions of the chemical at three plants in california 
new york and minnesota by nearly onethird from 33 billion pounds 
in 1987 to 23 billion pounds in 1988 its emissions of methyl 
chloroform also declined from 16 million pounds to 12 million 
pounds according to the figures from the environmental group 
hercules inc was the leading source of carbon tetrachloride 
emissions 1987 and again in 1988 when it spewed nearly 900000 
pounds of the chemical into the air from a parlin nj facility 
but the company said it stopped using the chemical altogether in 
august 1989 
but scores of smaller companies reported increases in emissions 
as did atampt technologies inc at lees summit mo where combined 
cfc113 and methyl chloride emissions increased by about 40000 
pounds to 744000 pounds in 1988 one of the highest amounts for 
any facility that year 
atampt has announced a corporatewide goal of eliminting its 
reliance on cfcs as a cleaning solvent by the mid1990s

thousands rallied tuesday in 
memory of jan palach the student who killed himself to protest the 
1968 sovietled invasion and the new president said palachs hopes 
for a free country are coming true 
also on tuesday the new noncommunist interior minister 
announced the dismantling of the secret police the latest step in 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution that ended four decades of 
communist rule 
the rally in palachs memory drew president vaclav havel who 
was arrested last year when he tried to lay flowers in wenceslas 
square to honor palach 
havel was sentenced to eight months in prison released in may 
and became czechoslovakias first noncommunist president in 41 
years in december after large antigovernment protests 
everything that palach dreamt of and longed for is opening in 
front of us havel said 
when they arrested me in january i had a feeling that 20 
years after palachs sacrifice his absolute sacrifice was 
beginning to gain its value it was my feeling then it is my 
certainty now 
palach burned himself to death on jan 16 1969 to protest the 
invasion by five warsaw pact countries of czechoslovakia that 
crushed the liberal prague spring reforms under alexander 
dubcek 
havels arrest in january 1989 sparked a weeklong wave of street 
protests in prague with batonwielding police using water cannon 
and tear gas to disperse thousands 
the protests led to 50000 czechoslovak artists and workers 
signing a petition demanding havels release and immediate start of 
genuine reform 
another police crackdown on student demonstrators nov 17 marked 
the beginning of the countrys peaceful revolution 
on behalf of the parisbased jan palach foundation leading 
members of the czechoslovak student movement received the annual 
jan palach award presented at the rally by french actor yves 
montand 
already today we see that the defeated structure has not 
surrendered yet and keeps dreaming its crazy dream hoping to 
regain power said student martin klima by receiving the award 
we pledge to continue his struggle to be vigilant and issue a 
warning 
the rally took place on palach square formerly known as red 
army soldiers square in front of charles university where palach 
studied history after the rally havel returned to lay flowers for 
palach at wenceslas square where he was arrested last year 
interior minister richard sacher announced the officers in 
charge of the central and local branches of the secret police were 
suspended their written documents sealed and their weapons 
confiscated 
their further fate will be determined during the ongoing 
interviews by the police force sacher said without 
elaborating 
sacher said that departments dealing with the socalled 
struggle against the internal enemy were also abolished 
the work of the state secret security bureau known as the stb 
included information gathering on church activists dissidents 
young people scientists cultural figures emigres and anyone 
else considered likely to be a threat to the communist state 
i want to inform the public about measures that were gradually 
taken by the new leadership of the interior ministry because there 
are doubts about this among the public and the media as well 
sachers statement said 
the government in december said the abolition of the stb was one 
of its goals 
the government also wants the estimated 75000 soviet troops to 
pull out of czechoslovakia by the end of the year talks on the 
soviet withdrawal continued for a second day tuesday in prague and 
officials reported no progress

a un official suggested tuesday the army was 
stalling in its investigation of a complaint that israeli soldiers 
stripped a 9yearold palestinian boy hung him by his heels and 
beat him for three hours 
a military spokesman said the armys southern command which is 
responsible for the occupied gaza strip where the palestinian boy 
was beaten had begun an investigation he gave no further details 
claire grimes spokeswoman for the un relief and works agency 
said mahmoud alhissy suffered broken wrists a dislocated left 
elbow and welts all over his body as a result of the beating in 
gazas shati refugee camp 
she said her agency filed a complaint immediately after the 
incident on feb 25 1989 but we have received no reply 
amnon rubinstein a lawmaker of the liberal shinui party raised

englishlanguage text of a statement issued tuesday 
on cambodia by the five permanent members of the un security 
council the united states the soviet union china britain and 
france 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the five permanent members of the un security council meeting 
in paris on jan 1516 1990 agreed that they would be guided by 
the following principles in working for a resolution of the 
cambodian problem 
no acceptable solution can be achieved by force of arms 
an enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive 
political settlement including the verified withdrawal of foreign 
forces a ceasefire and the cessation of outside military 
assistance 
the goal should be selfdetermination for the cambodian people 
through free fair and democratic elections 
all accept an enhanced un role in the resolution of the 
cambodian problem 
there is an urgent need to speed up diplomatic efforts to 
achieve a settlement 
the complete withdrawal of foreign forces must be verified by 
the un 
the five would welcome an early resumption of a constructive 
dialogue among the cambodian factions which is essential to 
facilitating the transition process which should not be dominated 
by any one of them 
an effective un presence will be required during the 
transition period in order to assure internal security 
a special representative of the un secretarygeneral is 
needed in cambodia to supervise un activities during a transition 
period culminating in the inauguration of a democratically elected 
government 
the scale of the un operation should be consistent with the 
successful implementation of a cambodian settlement and its 
planning and execution should take account of the heavy financial 
burden that may be placed on member states 
free and fair elections must be conducted under direct un 
administration 
the elections must be conducted in a neutral political 
environment in which no party would be advantaged 
the five permanent members commit themselves to honoring the 
results of free and fair elections 
all cambodians should enjoy the same rights freedoms and 
opportunities to participate in the election process 
a supreme national council might be the repository of 
cambodian sovereignty during the transition process 
questions involving cambodian sovereignty should be resolved 
with the agreement of the cambodian parties 
the five support all responsible efforts by regional parties to 
achieve a comprehensive political settlement and will remain in 
close touch with them with the view to reconvening the paris 
conference at an appropriate time

two young children have been sexually 
assaulted abused and killed in the past two weeks and in both 
cases family friends who had visited the youngsters homes were 
arrested 
one of the victims may have been tortured over the period of a 
week and the other was smothered and strangled 
i think there is a myth generally believed by many people that 
children are sexually assaulted by a stranger in a trench coat who 
lurks in an alley and offers them candy said milwaukee county 
assistant district attorney john dimotto who is prosecuting both 
cases 
the two cases have left parents yearning for knowlege of how 
to keep their children safe said mary ann grochowski a 
psychotherapist in this city of 600000 
both of the victims parents did not know their children were 
being abused and even social workers who visited the families did 
not detect the abuse and other parents are now worried they too 
may be missing signs of abuse ms grochowski said 
i know its affecting the general population of milwaukee 
ms grochowski said its provoking a great deal of panic 
fouryearold mistydawn faust was found dead in the bedroom of 
her mothers apartment early dec 31 she was bleeding heavily from 
the groin area and suffered cuts on her chin throat and eyelid 
authorities said an autopsy determined she had been strangled and 
smothered probably with a pillow 
gary d crubaugh 18 was arrested the same day and charged with 
murder and firstdegree sexual assault of a child 
the criminal complaint said crubaugh spent the evening of dec 
30 playing cards with mistydawns mother 28yearold peggy messer 
and her fiance after the couple went to bed crubaugh slept on the 
couch 
he is accused of raping and killing the child during the night 
its affected a lot of the officers who investigated this 
one police lt michael krzewinski said detectives who werent 
even involved in the investigation came to work in a real jovial 
mood with food to contribute to our new years eve dinner and when 
they heard about this case a pall just fell over the room most of 
the guys on the later shift have young children this really hit 
home 
last friday michelle lagoo reported her 18monthold son kurt 
was missing 
after a daylong search by police fbi agents and about 100 
volunteers ms lagoos 25yearold boyfriend shane h king who 
had been babysitting kurt told police the boy was dead and led 
them to the body left in a garbage bag at a desolate farm 
king was charged monday with murder and firstdegree sexual 
assault of a child he later tried to kill himself in his cell and 
was ordered to undergo a psychiatric exam 
the criminal complaint alleges king abused kurt for about a week 
and tortured and killed the boy friday while his mother was at work 
an autopsy determined the boy had suffered a blunt force trauma 
to the abdomen and also was choked raped bitten and burned with 
a cigarette lighter 
the milwaukee county department of social services had contact 
with both of the victims families before the killings but in 
neither case was there any sign of abuse said department spokesman 
jefferson aikin 
caseworkers saw no danger aikin said because the source of 
danger was outside the home 
we frequently find that the boyfriend is the one that 
committed the assault he said often theyre not in the home 
they live outside the home theyre not suspected

the un security councils five permanent members 
agreed tuesday to seek a cambodian peace plan that would include 
free elections administered and supervised by the united nations 
after two days of meetings the five countries issued a 16point 
summary of principles including an effective un presence to 
assure peace prior to elections the statment indicated 
international peacekeepers would be used 
an enduring peace can only be achieved through a comprehensive 
political settlement including the verified withdrawal of foreign 
forces a ceasefire and the cessation of outside military 
assistance the statement said the goal should be 
selfdetermination for the cambodian people through free fair and 
democratic elections 
french and us officials said representaives of the security 
council members the united states soviet union china france 
and britain will meet again in about two weeks in new york to 
advance the peace plan a third meeting is expected in paris in 
february 
were at least going to make a strong try at it said a 
senior us official speaking on condition of anonymity were 
not talking about a process that would take several years but its 
clear it will take several months 
the official said there were many details to be worked out and 
that the government and the three guerrilla factions would have to 
lay down their arms 
clearly the cambodians themselves have to be a major part of 
the process the us official said it cant just be plunked 
down on their heads 
the vietnamesebacked government of premier hun sen and the 
three guerrilla factions allied in an uneasy coalition have given 
at least cautious support for a major un role 
the statement suggested that a supreme national council 
might be set up during the transition process there was no 
agreement on the councils membership or what powers it would have 
the us official said 
the statement by the general assembly members did not 
specifically mention hun sens government or the guerrilla 
coalition led by prince norodom sihanouk 
it said the security council members would welcome an early 
resumption of a constructive dialogue among the cambodian 
factions and that the transition process should not be 
dominated by any one of them 
the security council delegations were headed by soviet deputy 
foreign minister igor rogachev us assistant secretary of state 
richard solomon chinese vice minister xu dunxin british deputy 
foreign minister david gillmore and claude martin the director 
for asia in frances foreign ministry 
french foreign minister roland dumas opened the discussions 
monday saying the countries had a special responsibility to make 
sure that one guerrilla faction the khmer rouge never returns to 
power in cambodia 
the khmer rouge were responsible for hundreds of thousands of 
deaths when their leader pol pot ruled cambodia from 197578 they 
were chased out by a vietnamese invasion in 1978 
son sann a former prime minister who heads the noncommunist 
khmer peoples national liberation front wrote in tuesdays 
editions of the conservative daily le figaro that he would approve 
a un interim administration and a peacekeeping force to enforce a 
ceasefire 
son sann said the guerrilla coalition should retain cambodias 
seat in the united nations during the transition period but should 
not participate in debates or votes 
other proposals have called for declaring the cambodian seat 
vacant until free elections are held the coalition has held 
cambodias un seat since 1982 
china is the chief supplier of the communist khmer rouge 
gurrilla group the united states backs the two noncommunist 
guerrilla groups in the coalition and the soviet union supports hun 
sens government 
in beijing tuesday sihanouk rejected the reported proposal of 
premier hun sen to allow the guerrilla groups to administer the 
territories they control until elections are held 
sihanouk said the proposal would mean partitioning cambodia 
with vietnam gaining complete control of one portion hun sen 
knows that in the weeks and months to come he will lose more and 
more territory to the resistance sihanouk said 
the resistance has claimed significant victories over hun sens 
forces since vietnam ended its 11year military occupation of the 
country last fall

the widow of investorpublisher john hay whitney 
will offer a renoir from the couples collection for sale for an 
estimated 40 million to 50 million sothebys auction house said 
tuesday 
pierreauguste renoirs 1876 artwork acclaimed for its light 
shadow and movement depicts the moulin de la galette a french 
outdoor dance hall in montmartre frequented by avantgarde writers 
painters and actors 
it shows a model named estelle siting at a table with three of 
renoirs friends including biographer georges rivere who later 
described the painting as a page of history a precious moment of 
paris life depicted with rigorous examination 
the painting was owned for 60 years by whitney and his wife 
betsey cushing whitney 
whitney who died in 1982 founded jh whitney amp co a 
venturecapitalist firm and was an ambassador to great britain and 
publisher of the new york herald tribune 
he became a trustee of the museum of modern art in 1930 was 
named president in 1941 and was chairman from 1946 to 1956 he was 
a trustee of the national gallery of art in washington from 1961 to 
1979 
a larger version of au moulin de la galette is in the musee 
dorsay in paris it is believed one was painted at the scene and 
the other at renoirs studio but no one knows which is which 
sothebys will take the whitney version to paris for a 
comparison in february then after exhibits in tokyo zurich 
paris and london the renoir will return to new york for an auction 
on may 16 
after whitneys death his wife gave five institutions 20 works 
by edgar degas paul gauguin pablo picasso henri rousseau 
georges seurat james abbott mcneill whistler and other artists 
several other whitneys also are wellknown in the art world

lapin agile a paris tavern scene on nov 17 for 407 million 
mrs de roulets brother john whitney payson sold vincent van 
goghs irises in 1987 for 539 million the highest price ever 
obtained at an art auction 
payson got his money but other parts of the deal went sour it 
turned out sothebys had lent australian tycoon alan bond 27 
million to help buy irises using the painting itself as 
collateral bond didnt pay off the loan the van gogh is now in a 
vault its ownership cloudy last week sothebys announced it was 
abandoning its loan policy which triggered the quandary and 
which critics charged inflated art prices in general 
both the van gogh and the picasso came from the collection of 
former new york mets owner joan whitney payson whitneys sister 
and the mother of mrs de roulet and john whitney payson

teachers union leaders expressed alarm 
tuesday over a new report that says the united states lags behind 
most other industrial nations in spending on elementary and 
secondary schools administration officials were concerned but 
skeptical about the studys methods 
this new report is shocking said keith geiger president of 
the national education association the nations largest teachers 
union well never be able to compete effectively in the global 
marketplace if we dont match the commitment to education that our 
competitors make 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said the report by the laborbacked economic policy 
institute should button the lips of those who claim education is 
adequately funded 
the report shortchanging education said that among 
industrial nations only ireland and australia spend less than the 
united states in investing in elementary and secondary education 
sweden austria switzerland norway belgium denmark japan 
canada west germany france the netherlands britain and italy 
all invest more said the report which was based on education 
expenditures as a percentage of national income in 1985 
the education department balked at the methodology used by 
authors m edith rasell and lawrence mishel 
when elementary and secondary school spending is accurately 
compared to other nations as average per pupil expenditures and 
not as share of national income the us ranks second only to 
switzerland the department said in a statement 
asked about the report white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said i dont have an analysis of that but added we have to 
be concerned 
education secretary lauro cavazos is looking at various 
solutions and we have convened the governors summit and we want 
to look at new goals and objectives but clearly this lays out 
some problems that need to be dealt with especially at the primary 
and secondary level 
geiger said that over the 1980s previous nea reports have found 
that federal financial aid to elementary and secondary schools fell 
by onethird from 92 percent to 62 percent 
this report demonstrates that the criticism of socalled 
excessive spending on education is at the very least 
overstated said shanker we are not making an effort 
comparable to most industrialized countries and we should stop 
implying that we are 
sen edward kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor and 
human resources committee agreed we get what we pay for its 
no coincidence that the united states ranks near the bottom of 
industrialized nations in educational performance 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee said it is embarrassing to see the united 
states in the bargain basement of international educational 
support

barbara bush said tuesday that women should be 
able to serve in combat as long as they have the physical strength 
to match their ability to shoot and fly as well as men 
certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than able to 
compete with a man she said in a wideranging interview with 
three reporters she also said 
her eyes havent improved from the justcompleted radiation 
treatment to combat symptoms of graves disease but she is 
cautiously optimistic im so eager to be better that i think im 
better she said acknowledging she still has double vision 
especially in the morning 
she doesnt know why her soaring popularity consistently 
surpasses president bushs own high ratings i dont threaten 
anyone im just a nice fat grandmother she offered as an 
explanation 
her son neil bush hasnt done anything wrong in his 
onetime role as a board member of silverado savings and loan neil 
bush has been questioned by federal regulators about the failed sampl 
asked whether women should serve in combat as they did in 
panama mrs bush gave a qualified yes 
if i thought a woman physically could pick up someone who was 
wounded and carry them to safety if i thought they could throw a 
hand grenade as far as a man then i would say fine 
they can shoot as well they can fly as well the only problem 
i would have is if it risks somebody elses life because they 
couldnt throw a hand grenade as far or carry someone 
bush has said he would be willing to hear recommendations from 
the pentagon about women in combat the pentagons official policy 
is that women do not serve in combat roles women unexpectedly 
became involved in combat in panama 
mrs bush said george doesnt hide secrets from her 
including the panama invasion and that he discusses ideas with her 
about world affairs but mrs bush said she knew something was 
afoot even before the president told her the specifics of the 
invasion 
it was very clear to me that we were having an awful lot of 
people in the house she said i knew pretty clearly that 
something was happening 
mrs bush said she was surprised at how much she enjoys being 
first lady 
i thought id like it but i never dreamed that i would love 
it she said 
she said her most difficult duty was to attend a memorial 
service for the 47 seamen killed in the april 19 explosion aboard 
the uss iowa 
mrs bush met tuesday with the reporters in the airy west hall 
room of the white house second floor her eyes though tearing 
slightly looked less puffy than they have on some recent days 
she said she can always tell which of my friends have been to 
the grocery store when they call to ask about her health after 
eading dire reports in supermarket tabloids 
they are so fake she said of the tabloids 
told that it was a first visit to the second floor for one of 
the reporters she insisted on an impromptu tour 
look at the tourists arent they cute she said waving to 
a woman from the window of the room where she keeps her clothes 
on other subjects mrs bush said 
she had been a little testy about an avalanche of letters 
saying its unsafe for the president to attend the feb 15 drug 
summit in violencetorn colombia she said she would prefer the 
summit be elsewhere but i cant change his mind or make those 
decisions 
she plans to write a book after leaving the white house based 
on 30 years of diaries but says it wont be a kiss and tell 
a lot of progress is being made in her war against 
illiteracy but its a drop in the bucket were trying to 
change the whole system

the food and drug administration on tuesday 
cut in half the recommended dose of the antiaids drug azt 
reducing the cost and likely side effects of azt therapy 
some physician experts in treating aids already are prescribing 
lower doses the agencys action will send the message to other 
doctors that the low dose is just as effective as the high dose and 
causes fewer side effects 
the fda ordered changes in the labels on azt also known as 
zidovudine to recommend 600 milligrams a day after one month at 
1200 milligrams a day the previous recommendation for a daily 
dose 
the change means that fewer patients may have to discontinue 
azt therapy because of serious side effects health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan said in a statement 
dr james mason assistant secretary for health said the lower 
dose also would reduce treatment costs for aids patients receiving 
azt 
a years treatment with azt at the current recommended dose 
costs about 8000 or more tuesdays recommendation would mean 
annual costs of about 4300 or more 
mark harrington representing the aids activist group act up 
said the fdas action was great news and important because it 
will get the word to conservative doctors who prescribe 
strictly according to a drugs label 
the decision also is important because high doses of azt have 
been keeping aids patients out of clinical drug trials in which 
the drug is compared with other therapies in these trials azt is 
administered at the previously recommended high dose he said 
partly because of cost and partly because of toxicity we need 
to find out what the lowest possible dose is he said 
harrington said the fda recommendation was long overdue he 
noted that preliminary findings of the study on which the action is 
based were released last july 
on the basis of those initial findings by the governments 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases many 
physicians began prescribing the lower dose dose recommendations 
on the label do not prevent doctors from prescribing higher or 
lower doses of the drug if they believe it is warranted 
the fda said clinical data from the study became sufficiently 
collected and analyzed in november and were submitted to the fda 
by the manufacturer burroughs wellcome co on dec 18 
while producing fewer adverse reactions the halfdose regimen 
was as effective as a higher test does in prolonging survival and 
reducing the frequency of opportunistic infections that often kill 
aids patients according to the agencys analysis 
the study however did not determine whether the lower dose is 
as effective in aiding neurological problems in aids patients 
officials said 
azt is the only antiaids drug approved by the fda that directly 
combats the virus that causes the fatal disease which destroys the 
bodys ability to resist infections and other diseases 
however the highly toxic drug can inhibit the production of red 
blood cells causing severe anemia it can also reduce the number 
of infectionfighting white blood cells to dangerously low levels 
requiring the patient to discontinue use of the drug 
in the clinical study 262 patients were given 1500 milligrams 
of azt a day for two years to see if higherthanrecommended doses 
produce any benefit another group of the same size was given 1200 
milligrams a day for a month and then 600 milligrams a day for the 
rest of the period said kathy bartlett a spokeswoman for 
burroughs wellcome 
patients in the lowdose group were found to have fewer side 
effects than those in the highdose group without any apparent 
difference in benefit among those receiving the high dose nearly 
half had serious adverse reactions that required them to 
discontinue azt treatment while only a quarter of the lowdose 
patients had to stop treatment

antipollution equipment 
was rushed tuesday to porto santo after patches of oil washed 
ashore killing wildlife and fouling this madeira islands white 
sand beaches portuguese authorities said 
the cause of the spill which began monday was not immediately 
known 
porto santo mayor jose jorge de gois mendonca said the north and 
east coasts of this small atlantic island 425 miles off morocco had 
been hardest hit by the oil smaller spills were reported off the 
south coast where most tourists stay 
oil slicks stretching over 12 miles were reported off the 
island posing further threat to porto santo its drinking water 
and to a nature reserve on the uninhabited desertas islands where 
colonies of the rare mediterranean monk seal reside 
officials warned of ecological disaster if the oil washes up on 
the desertas 37 miles south the rocky islands house several rare 
maritime animals including one of the worlds last breeding 
colonies of the mediterranean monk seal an endangered species 
locals told authorities that the blackened bodies of seagulls 
and turtles killed by the oil already had washed onto porto santos 
5milelong main beach 
the portuguese government in lisbon 625 miles northeast on 
tuesday sent an air force transport plane carrying an 
antipollution team floating barriers pumps and other equipment 
to help combat the mysterious slick 
portuguese navy officers said it was unlikely the crude came 
from the iranian oil tanker khark 5 which leaked more than 19 
million gallons in the region last month the lusa news agency 
reported 
authorities told lusa the oil that washed up this week was dense 
and black suggesting a more recent leak oil that has been in the 
sea longer turns yellowish and foamy the report said

the soviet military chief urged the 
united states tuesday to match sharp cuts in troops weapons and 
spending moscow is making as part of its plan to reshape the soviet 
unions defense policy 
the call by gen mikhail moiseyev followed comments by gen 
colin powell chairman of the us joint chiefs of staff 
cautioning that soviet forces remain predominant in europe but 
praising moscows policy change powell also held out the 
possiblity of us troop cuts saying there was nothing 
sacrosanct about the number of american troops stationed in 
europe 
the military chiefs statements came on the opening day of a 
threeweek bargaining session designed to ease eastwest tensions 
in europe 
the talks known as the military doctrine seminar have 
coincided with removal of hardline leaders in every warsaw pact 
country western experts are eager to learn how the political 
reforms that have occurred in easter europe since last year might 
affect those countrys defense policies 
the session marks the first time the top brass of 35 nations 
have sat down to try to lift some of the secrecy surrounding 
military affairs 
moiseyev explained moscows change from offensive to defensive 
strategy and urged the united states and its allies to make 
similar military cuts 
we need reciprocity and would like to see it in the nearest 
future moiseyev said 
earlier powell said the western allies were still concerned 
about the specter of confronting greatly superior forces armed 
trained and suited for offensive ground operations 
but powell welcomed the change in soviet strategy and added 
there is nothing carved in stone that says that military power in 
a divided europe should remain as it has over the last four 
decades 
the us has about 300000 troops stationed in europe compared 
with about 575000 soviet troops according to us figures 
the north atlantic treaty organization maintains its forces are 
the minimum needed to defend against not launch an attack 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev about a year ago announced 
plans to cut unilaterally all soviet military forces by 500000 
troops and reduce conventional or nonnuclear arms substantially 
moiseyev said half the reductions have occurred and the rest 
will be carried out this year 
as of jan 1 he said total soviet armed forces were pared by 
265000 he said 9320 tanks more than 5050 artillery systems and 
835 warplanes have been pulled out of europe 
the soviet military budget was cut by 82 percent last year and 
will be slashed by more than 14 percent over the next two years he 
said 
we also intend if the situation permits to drastically by 
15 to 2 times reduce the share of the national incomes spending 
on defense by 1995 he said 
arms production will go down nearly 20 percent he said 
sir david craig chief of the british defense staff described 
moiseyevs talk as very interesting but said he didnt find 
much new in it 
craig said the west wanted to believe the soviet intention to 
change its military policy 
but there is a long way to go between intentions and 
execution he said we must wait and see how that execution is 
carried out 
later tuesday the bulgarian military chief gen christo 
dobrev whose country last november removed its longtime ruler 
todor zhivkov said bulgaria has trimmed defense spending and 
reduced the number of troops and weapons 
he said bulgaria has always followed a defensive posture and the 
cuts will strengthen that policy 
dobrev was the only east european officer to speak on the 
opening day poland czechoslovakia and east germany were on 
wednesdays agenda 
gen lee butler of the us joint chiefs of staff said dobrevs 
remarks were an early indication of where force structure might 
be going within the nonsoviet warsaw pact countries 
he predicted the warsaw pact countries would talk a great deal 
about how theyre going to restructure and reduce and change the 
character of their armed forces in the direction of defensive 
policies

rescuers chopped and cut through the 
wreckage of a twinengine propeller plane high up a rugged mountain 
and retrieved all 23 bodies aboard tuesday including those of five 
americans authorities said 
the plane crashed about 4500 feet up 7450foot pico blanco 
mountain 10 miles southwest of san jose five minutes after taking 
off in driving rain monday morning from the capitals juan 
santamaria airport the public security ministry reported 
red cross and costan rican officials said victims included three 
costa rican crew members and up to 14 foreigners 
the state department in washington identified three of the 
american victims as david ulland of austin minn lester ross of 
lancaster pa and norman baltimore of east smithfield pa 
it said families of two other americans were being notified 
the newspaper la nacion said seven canadians were aboard 
canadian consul peter boehm told the associated press he had no 
immediate information on canadian deaths but it is very possible 
that what was said on the number of canadians could be true 
the 9yearold spanishmade aerocar aircraft belonged to 
servicios aereos nacionales a subsidiary of lineas aereas 
costaricenses sa the national airline and was on a regular 
flight to the small southern town of palmar norte 
a red cross spokesman said in a telephone interview that efforts 
were under way to bring the bodies down the mountain 
the work has become very difficult because pico blanco is 
covered with dense shrub and the surface is very irregular he 
said 
he refused to give his name 
about 100 rescue workers from the red cross the civil guard and 
the fire department reached the wreckage late monday and used axes 
and chainsaws to cut through the wreckage they retrieved the last 
bodies early tuesday after it stopped raining the red cross

about 130 workers at a southern coal mine 
have started a sitin strike for higher pay and small groups of 
employees at four other mines also are refusing to work polish 
television reported tuesday 
the work stoppage over pay demands which began monday night 
was the biggest since a radical economic austerity program backed 
by the noncommunist government took effect jan 1 
also tuesday the pap news agency reported that the solidarity 
government has set up fund to assist up to 400000 workers who 
could lose their jobs as a result of economic reform 
the television report said the miners were demanding an increase 
in wages preservation of their privileges a decrease in 
administrative personnel and no repercussions for strikers 
the government has adopted a tight wage policy in an effort to 
bring down inflation that soared to about 900 percent last year 
after a partial lifting of price controls last august 
most of the remaining price controls were lifted on jan 1 and 
prices have soared again ahead of wages 
the television report said the reasons for work stoppages at two 
other mines in walbrzych and two more near the industrial city of 
katowice were similar to those given by workers at the thorez mine 
miners in walbrzych had warned last week they would strike if 
their demands for a reduction in administrative personnel were not 
met 
it was difficult to determine how many people were likely to 
become unemployed as a result of the reform program but from 
400000 to 5 million could lose their jobs pap said 
among the components of the plan enacted by the government are 
tight credit a tough wage policy and a drastic reduction of state 
subsidies and steep price increases for energy transportation and 
communications 
the fund can cover about 200000 jobless with unemployment 
benefits for several months the news agency said 
there are also plans to create 25000 new jobs for those 
dismissed and another 10000 for invalids pap said about 10000 
will be offered small loans to start private businesses 
the fund also will provide equalizing payments for 50000 
workers who lose their jobs due to group dismissals or are forced 
to accept lower paying jobs 
the fund relies on mandatory contributions from workplaces but 
the state will step in with contributions from the budget if more 
funds are needed the agency said

community center bush said he had dropped by to say thank you 
to those in the community who are standing shoulder to shoulder 
with those who are fighting this drug menace we simply have got to 
win this fight 
bush was accompanied by jack kemp the secretary of housing and 
urban development on the earlyafternoon tour 
kemp said the visit should be seen as a signal to drug dealers 
that public housing no longer is going to be a free haven for 
their activities 
bush and kemp discussed the adminstrations 21 billion 
package introduced in november to provide matching federal grants 
to make it easier for public housing residents to buy their 
dwellings 
the president called on congress to act on the measure when it 
reconvenes jan 23 and to pass a longlanguishing proposal for 
urban enterprise zones that would give businesses tax breaks for 
establishing in inner cities 
security was tight for bushs foray into the highcrime 
neighborhood reporters travelling in his motorcade were not told 
of his destination until he arrived helicopters hovered overhead 
and the area was cordoned off by police 
in mild springlike weather a steadily building crowd gathered 
outside hastily assembled police barricades to watch bush kemp and 
other members of their entourage visit an a unit in the development 
and then the community center about a block away 
we were just driving by kemp joked 
their first stop was the home of community activists pete and 
corina jones in one of many of the twostory brick buildings that 
make up the housing project i was a little shocked to see the 
president come into my house jones said later it shows we do 
have a president who cares 
the president praised ramona younger leader of the alexandria 
public housing residents council and an organizer of the allnight 
vigils 
ive been inspired by the stories ive heard of her 
leadership her toughness her willingness to take these people

the oncedominant cbs evening news now 
trailing abcs world news tonight in ratings was third last 
week national audience estimates showed tuesday 
abcs newscast anchored by peter jennings easily won the week 
ending jan 14 with a ratings average of 119 it was the 12th time 
this season the program has triumphed over cbss newscast 
according to an abc spokesman 
tom brokaws nbc nightly news which usually is in third 
place was second in ratings last week with a 109 average edging 
out rathers newscast which was third by a narrow margin of 
onetenth of a ratings point 
acording to the ac nielsen co each ratings point represents 
921000 homes 
cbs officials had no immediate explanation for rathers 
thirdplace finish which last happened in the final week of 
december according to cbs 
last week one major cbs affiliate kpixtv in san francisco 
shifted rathers program to an earlier 530 pm pst start time 
but it isnt known yet if that was a factor in the weeks 
nielsen returns for the program said michael eisenberg cbs vice 
president for audience measurement 
we couldnt point to that as the only reason right now he 
said in an interview tuesday were studying the matter and 
trying to find out what the reasons are 
in a news conference in los angeles over the weekend rather 
said i intend to keep right on keeping on its true the cbs 
evening news is a work in progress were constantly trying to 
improve 
asked about his delivery of the news from a standing position 
the anchorman said ive always wanted to stand and do the 
broadcast i dont think thats cosmetic 
rather and cbs news president david burke said they were unable 
to explain the ratings tumble 
but each discounted speculation that some of it was due to 
rathers muchpublicized onair confrontation with then gop 
presidential candidate george bush during a cbs evening news 
interview in early 1988 
burke blamed part of the programs ratings slide on what he 
called statistical errors in the nielsen ratings system and on the 
programs of other broadcast outlets such as the 24hour cable news 
network 
there is increasing competition from cnn which means you 
dont have to make an appointment to watch the news anymore you 
have it on all the time and i think they do a fine job burke 
said

a chicago suburb agreed tuesday to allow 
contruction of a group home for the retarded in a federal court 
settlement that may ease efforts to build housing for the 
handicapped across the nation 
chicago heights also agreed to pay 45000 in damages and report 
for five years all actions affecting housing for the handicapped 
we hope other communities will get the message that the 
handicapped have rights under the fair housing act said james p 
turner acting head of the justice departments civil rights 
division 
if local officials dont pay attention to those rights they 
will pay damages for violating them turner said 
under the consent decree approved by us district judge william 
t hart chicago heights agreed to issue a zoning permit before 
weeks end to residential facilities management services inc of 
galesburg ill the permit will allow construction of a group home 
for 15 retarded adults 
the agreement settles lawsuits filed june 20 by the justice 
department and the next day by the corporation charging the city 
council violated the fair housing act when it voted may 1 to turn 
down a request for the zoning permit 
the lawsuits were the first brought by the government under the 
fair housing amendment enacted last year to protect the handicapped 
the lawsuits contended the city council vote was motivated by 
opposition from residents prejudiced against the retarded 
chicago heights while not admitting to any discrimination 
agreed to pay 30000 to rfms for construction delays and 1000 to 
each of the 15 people who eventually will live in the home 
the city contends the permit was denied because rfms had not 
supplied necessary documents with its application 
the fact that the inhabitants happened to be developmentally 
disabled was not a factor said chicago heights lawyer nick j 
digiovanni 
he said the city agreed to the settlement in recognition of 
the cost saving of not having to go to trial to be vindicated 
under the agreement chicago heights officials also must report 
to the federal government for the next five years any other 
applications they receive from anyone wanting to operate a facility 
for the handicapped 
they must report within five days any changes made in local laws 
governing such facilities 
rfms must submit site plans and other documents to the city and 
pledge that the home will not be used to care for mentally ill or 
emotionally disturbed patients it also must limit the number of 
residents to 15 
justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade said the 
settlement may make it easier for the government to obtain court 
orders in future cases involving the refusal of local governments 
to grant permits for group homes 
our hope is that this agreement will be noted by other 
communities not only in the chicago metropolitan area of illinois 
but nationwide that its impermissible for them to deny access to 
living accommodations on behalf of developmentally disabled 
persons said richard e friedman attorney for rfms which 
operates 55 group homes in 35 other illinois communities 
group homes for the handicapped usually established in 
residential neighborhoods are designed to encourage independence 
residents live under supervision but are given greater 
responsibility for everyday decisions than in other facilities

mexican authorities are looking into claims 
that a murdered us drug enforcement administration agent was 
actually in league with drug traffickers mexicos attorney general 
said tuesday 
at a memorial service for 44 mexican narcotics agents killed in 
the line of duty attorney general enrique alvarez del castillo 
said mexican officials had no independent corroboration of press 
reports that the dea agent enrique camarena was corrupt 
we are checking the basis of those reports said alvarez 
who refused to give further details in a brief encounter with 
reporters 
the reports which involved marijuana busts in northwestern 
mexico surfaced last week after the broadcast of the nbctv 
miniseries drug wars based on camarenas murder in 1985 by top 
mexican drug traffickers 
us officials have denied camarena was corrupt in any way 
noting the charges were old and never backed by any evidence 
the miniseries which showed corrupt mexican officials aiding 
narcotics traffickers and thwarting the investigation of camarenas 
murder caused controversy in mexico comments on nbc news programs 
that followed the miniseries angered mexicans by suggesting the 
corruption that killed camarena still exists 
alvarezs remarks overshadowed a speech by president carlos 
salinas de gortari to 400 law enforcement officials and relatives 
of the dead officers in which salinas vowed to press the fight 
against official corruption 
the first condition for attacking narcotics trafficking is to 
dismantle and destroy the networks of corruption that protect it 
salinas said 
salinas has made an effort to remove drug trafficking as an 
irritant in usmexico relations winning praise from us 
officials for vigorously pursuing drug traffickers 
such pursuit has resulted in the seizure of 36 tons of cocaine 
in the 13 months salinas has been in office more than was seized 
the previous 10 years 
nevertheless the government newspaper el nacional published a 
frontpage story friday that quoted anonymous sources as saying 
camarena had been murdered because he had betrayed the drug 
traffickers he worked for 
dea spokesman frank shultz in washington said there was not a 
scintilla of evidence whatsoever that enrique camarena was involved 
with the traffickers in any way other than an adversarial role 
elaine shannon author of the book desperados on which the 
miniseries was based said mexican authorities began attacking 
camarenas integrity in 1985 in order to divert attention from 
themselves and even tried to set up a fake bank account to prove 
camarena took dirty money 
its rather sad that the mexican government is reduced to this 
transparent attempt at slander rather than to try to improve their 
governments own ability to enforce their laws protect their 
citizens and bring drug traffickers and the people who killed 
camarena to justice shannon said 
kingpins rafael caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrillo were 
sentenced in december to 40 years in prison without parole for the 
camarena murder but many us officials believe the full story has 
not been told 
the memorial ceremony at mexico citys airport was hastily 
arranged to demonstrate mexicos commitment to the fight against 
drug trafficking following the jan 7 8 and 9 drug wars 
broadcasts 
meanwhile a mexican advertising group bought fullpage ads in 
the washington post the new york times and the los angeles times 
to outline mexicos antidrug efforts the ads cost a total of 
124340 
drug wars itself appeared in english on mexico citys cable 
tv system and a mexican network broadcast a program sunday that 
purported to expose the programs errors and included mention of 
the accusations against camarena 
nbc has defended the program and its reporting since then 
mexican officials say the controversy will not affect working 
relations between the two governments especially in narcotics 
we do not deny our problems nor do we look for excuses for 
our errors salinas said 
although the great majority of our agents have demonstrated 
great valor in fighting drug trafficking i repeat we will 
energetically punish those who involve themselves in drug 
trafficking he said 
salinas promises to fight corruption were given an added edge 
by the arrest of four mexico city police officers on rape charges 
the attorney generals office refused to comment on published 
reports at least three of the accused had been bodyguards for 
javier coello trejo the assistant attorney general in charge of 
the fight against drug traffickers

gun control advocates tuesady marked the first 
anniversary of the massacre of five california schoolchildren by 
announcing they want a government ban on imports of semiautomatic 
assaultstyle pistols 
these are killing machines said susan whitmore of handgun 
control inc adding that the organization will petition the 
government wednesday to eliminate imports of such pistols as the 
uzi and the hk94 shorter versions of assaultstyle rifles banned 
last summer 
among the 43 types of assaultstyle rifle imports banned last 
july was the popular ak47 model used by 24yearold drifter 
patrick purdy to kill five children and wound 29 others and a 
teacher on jan 17 1989 at a school playground in stockton calif 
but the treasury departments bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms as well as the national rifle association say banning the 
imports of the pistols will be a lot more difficult than the 
banning of the rifles 
the handgun regulations in place for the past two decades were 
intended to rule out cheap saturday night specials not 
wellmade sophisticated assaultstyle weapons said atf spokesman 
jack killorin 
those handguns that met the criteria atf established after 
congress approved the gun control act of 1968 including such 
things as barrel length round size overall length and weight 
have been considered to have met the sporting use requirement 
imposed on all imports he said 
the atf had more leeway to ban imports of the semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifles because in essence a new form of weapon had 
appeared that had been relatively unexamined under the law now 
you look at the issue of handguns and the degree to which that has 
been examined this is an area that doesnt lack examination 
it has been established and in practice for over 20 years 
because of the extensive legislative history and longstanding 
regulations for handgun imports it would be much more difficult 
for us to ban certain handgun imports he said 
i dont know how one would design criteria that would exclude 
the firearms theyre talking about and not exclude all the other 
firearms said jim baker the nras director of governmental 
affairs i think that handgun control would like to ban anything 
that theres a political or emotional opportunity to ban and this 
is consistent with that policy 
but david g mengebier handgun controls legislative counsel 
who wrote the petition said that like the assaultstyle rifles 
banned last july the assaultstyle pistols also reflect new 
technology and a new situation that calls for new regulations not 
accounted for in the legislative history 
all of the factors which atf considered persuasive in banning 
the importation of semiautomatic assault rifles are present and 
applicable to semiautomatic assault pistols the petition says 
with the exception of their length semiautomatic assault 
pistols are identitical to semiautomatic assault rifles in terms 
of their evolutionary development design physical components and 
intended use the petition says 
killorin said the atf could look at how the pistols are being 
used in real life one of the things that drove the issue of the 
semiautomatic assault rifles were the astonishing numbers that 
were beginning to appear for importation we may take a look at how 
many of these are coming in these may not be a significant import 
item 
mengebier said in an interview that his organization has not 
been given access to import figures for 1989 because they are 
considered proprietary information but he said its safe to say 
that thousands have been authorized for importation or are being 
imported

president bush urged americans to learn how to 
prevent childhood poisonings as he signed a proclamation tuesday 
designating march 1824 as national poison prevention week 
the united states by congressional decree has observed poison 
prevention week during the third week of march since 1961 in that 
time there has been a 93 percent drop in the number of deaths in 
children who accidentally swallow medicines or household chemicals 
accidental poisonings claimed the lives of 450 children under 
age 5 in 1961 according to an estimate by the consumer product 
safety commission in 1987 the latest year statistics were 
available 31 children died from accidental poisoning 
while many tragic deaths have been prevented in recent years 
we still have much work to do bush said 
accidental poisonings can be prevented if parents 
grandparents and other guardians keep medicines and household 
chemicals out of the reach of children adults should also be sure 
to store all potentially harmful substances in packages with 
childresistant closures

the survival of us television networks in 
the 1990s will depend on how they compete in a rapidly changing 
marketplace nbc president robert c wright told tv programmers 
tuesday 
the major broadcast networks are still locked into essentially 
one business and one traditional source revenue from 
advertisers wright said in the keynote address to the 27th 
annual gathering of the national association of television 
programming executives 
the cost of network programs is outpacing the growth of that 
revenue and 3 broadcast networks and 27 cable networks are 
bobbing around today in a modestly growing advertising 
marketplace 
networks will see more new competitors a diminished audience 
share and their very modest profit margins continue to shrink 
he said 
the boundaries are disappearing wright said but 
governmental regulations are forcing the networks to live behind 
televisions equivalent of the berlin wall 
he cited fox televisions emergence as a competing network and 
japanese electronics giant sony corps purchase of cbs records and 
columbia pictures 
movie studios buy tv stations and cable tv subsidiary turner 
communications has one of the largest tv and film libraries in the 
world 
against this backdrop the networks scream for freedom from 
the shackles of obsolete anticompetitive government 
regulations wright said 
specifically wright cited the federal communications 
commissions financialinterest syndication regulations known in 
the industry as finsyn or fisr 
the regulations bar nbc abc and cbs from having a financial 
interest in programs they dont produce themselves and also 
prohibits the networks from being in program syndication or sharing 
revenues from syndicated programs 
natpes annual meeting is the largest marketplace for syndicated 
programming in the world but the network presence is minimal 
the financial rules are an outgrowth of positions taken in the 
1960s they were intended to make the 1970s more competitive 
wright said 
in 1983 after four years of hearings the fcc federal trade 
commission and the commerce and justice departments concluded that 
the rules should be abolished he said political lobbying by the 
movie industry kept the rules alive he said 
letting the networks have a stake in entertainment programs 
would help networks pay the bill on news and sports and support 
network services to affiliates anything that restricts our 
ability to compete for quality entertainment programming also 
restricts the opportunity and profitability of more than 600 
networkaffiliated stations wright said 
financial interest doesnt guarantee us anything it only 
gives us an opportunity to produce and derive some ancillary 
benefit from our success on the air wright said 
wright in offering a series of predictions for the 1990s said 
the berlin wall of finsyn rules will collapse and fall under 
its own weight 
he also predicted that the creative financing techniques of 
movie making will move into tv production distributors 
producers exhibitors and syndicators will all have crossover 
interests and investments he said 
program standards will continue to stretch he said some 
services will do very nicely with programming that would be totally 
unacceptable on other networks he said the major networks will 
continue to meet the standards of most americans while others 
flirt with niche audiences who march to a different drummer 
wright said the 1990s will be an exciting decade for television 
with more programs needed to fit the growing array of services to 
the viewer 
less bureaucracy more entrepreneurship less history more 
future wright said the creative the patient the focused 
will survive the slow the encumbered and the backwardlooking 
will fail

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
announced tuesday a 14 percent increase in the amount of foreign 
sugar that can be imported by us processors from 39 countries 
yeutter said the increase boosts the sugar import quota to 
2584865 metric tons for the period jan 1 1989 through sept 
30 1990 an increase of 325000 tons 
this change in the level of the quota is necessary to counter 
the tightness in domestic sugar supplies caused by the unexpectedly 
low production of beet sugar and damage to the florida and texas 
sugar cane crops resulting from the december freeze yeutter said 
new countrybycountry allocations announced by us trade 
representative carla hills showed increases for nations approved to 
ship sugar to the united states however panama continued to have 
its quota suspended and will not be allowed to ship to the us 
market at this time she said 
quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can 
enter the united states thus protecting domestic producers from 
lowerpriced foreign sugar being dumped on the us market

a promoter of executive war games said tuesday 
he is having second thoughts about a contest whose objective is the 
mock assassination of novelist salman rushdie 
perhaps with hindsight it was an unfortunate idea said 
ian lawson director of skirmish a country lodge where executives 
work off stress by fighting mock battles 
bob gregory a spokesman for rushdies publisher viking 
penguin denounced the game as disgraceful and in bad taste 
heres a human being in hiding for fear of his life and theyre 
making a game out of it its beyond belief 
rushdie has been in hiding for 11 months following the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis appeal to moslems to kill him for 
writing the satanic verses a novel some moslems find 
blasphemous 
contacted by telephone at the lodge near guisborough in northern 
england lawson said the game entailed one team chasing a man in a 
luminous dinner jacket who carries a shield called the book 
while the opposing team defends him 
the players try to shoot him with paint guns while he tries 
to escape to a safe spot called the publishers and then to 
another place called the safe house lawson said 
he said he had not meant to offend anyone and was trying to 
contact viking penguin to apologize he said that in view of the 
criticism after the story surfaced in the local press he might 
drop the rushdie angle from the game 
those who come to play are not coming to shoot salman rushdie 
they come to have a fun day out and enjoy a variety of games 
including this one he said 
lawson said another game being developed for the lodge is the 
noriega game in which one team defends a player representing the 
ousted panamanian dictator while the other side tries to kidnap 
him

the free speech rights of three illinois 
residents were violated when they were rejected for state jobs or 
promotions because they failed to support republicans an attorney 
told the supreme court on tuesday 
in a case that will determine whether partisanship must be put 
aside when public employers hire promote or transfer attorney 
mary lee leahy asked the justices to apply past rulings that ban 
firings 
jobs are important to people promotions are important to 
people mrs leahy said 
the state has an obligation to be neutral when granting the 
benefits that are stake in this case she said 
mrs leahy represents two men and a woman who say their job 
status suffered because they did not vote in republican primaries 
or give money to the party 
their lawsuit which had been thrown out by two lower courts 
targets gov james r thompson the republican party of illinois 
and leaders of several state agencies 
mrs leahy said the governors office has controlled all new 
hires since 1980 in her written brief to the court she included a 
form that is used to screen state employees who seek a promotion 
and live in sangamon county 
the form asks employees to declare how they or in some cases 
their parents voted in primary elections it also asks whether the 
person would be willing to work for republicans during an election 
the attorney for thompson and illinois republicans said 
officials followed the state personnel code which require tests 
when people apply for a job 
all the people who were hired or promoted qualified under the 
code attorney thomas p sullivan said 
but he also acknowledged that when officials examine the field 
of qualified candidates they might favor someone who has the same 
political stripe 
sullivan said that hiring political supporters stimulates good 
government because the employee is likely to appreciate the job 
and in turn serve the public well 
both attorneys were interrupted several times by the justices 
justice antonin scalia said many political scientists believe 
patronage simply is part of the spoils system and helps 
preserve the countrys twoparty system 
mrs leahy replied this is not a way to preserve a twoparty 
system but a oneparty system 
the supreme court in a 1980 ruling that significantly weakened 
patronage said government workers may not be fired solely because 
of their political affiliation unless that affiliation was an 
appropriate requirement of carrying out their jobs 
the court however did not address the issues raised in the 
illinois case hiring promotion and transfer 
the lead petitioner is cynthia rutan who has worked for the 
illinois department of rehabilitative services since 1974 she has 
applied for promotions but has not received one she also has not 
supported republicans unlike people who were promoted over her 
franklin taylor has worked for the illinois department of 
transportation as an equipment operator for 21 years he sought a 
promotion in 1983 and said he was rejected because he did not have 
an endorsement from fulton county republicans 
the third petitioner is james moore he said he has tried to get 
a state job particularly with the corrections department since 
1978 but has failed because he could not obtain the signatures of 
the pope county republican chairman and a local gop lawmaker

the state department said tuesday it asked 
israel to explain reported comments by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir that the occupied west bank and gaza strip should be used to 
settle jews from the soviet union 
the department warned that money given to israel by the us 
government cannot be used to settle immigrants in the occupied 
territories where about 70000 israelis live among 17 million 
palestinians the us embassy in tel aviv has contacted the 
israeli government about the remarks shamir made sunday night to a 
meeting of his rightwing likud bloc a us official said 
israel expacts as many as 300000 soviet jews will arrive in 
coming years under the liberalized policies of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev and shamir aides want to direct the flow of 
immigrants to the territories 
for a large immigration we need the land of israel a great 
and strong israel shamir told the likud we will need a lot of 
place to absorb everybody he added the statement was broadcast 
monday on israeli radio 
the term land of israel is used by likud members and other 
hardliners in references to israel and the occupied territories 
which were captured from jordan and egypt by israel in the 1967 
middle east war 
we are seeking to clarify what he actually said said state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler we do not provide us 
government resources or funds for settlement of new immigrants in 
the occupied territories our current program is explicitly limited 
to israel and not the occupied territories 
shamir has also come under attack from the leftleaning labor 
party his partner in the coalition government which advocates 
trading some of the occupied land for peace 
israeli officials say they need 3 billion to absorb 100000 
immigrants over the next three to five years they are seeking at 
least 350 million in donations from american jews and have asked 
for the us government to guarantee 500 million in housing loans

work this week heading an agency with limited funding and whose 
former chief resigned amid allegations of misuse of funds 
its no joke to lead an organization that is supposed to help 
15 million people in such a difficult time and with an extremely 
tight budget still my old dream has been fulfilled thorvald 
stoltenberg was quoted tuesday as saying 
stoltenberg 58 a former norwegian foreign minister and 
ambassador to the united nations was elected for a fouryear term

hocke

cannot ignore those who fled poverty rather than persecution 
hall said tuesday the worldwide refugee population rose by 
700000 last year swelled by an influx into ethiopia of people

million in pakistan and iran

washington state officials have tentatively 
concluded that chemicals put in tanks of radioactive waste at the 
hanford nuclear reservation do not pose a serious risk of 
explosion the states top health official said tuesday 
kristine gebbie secretary of the state department of health 
said preliminary results of a study by state health and ecology 
officials found no special hazard existed from the chemicals she 
said a conclusion had not been reached 
the existence of the chemical ferrocyanide in the waste tanks 
and the possibility that the mixture could trigger a massive 
explosion was detailed in a 1984 study for the energy department 
that was kept secret until last fall 
the chemical was added to the tanks in the mid1950s to help 
separate the radioactive metals from the liquid waste the wastes 
were generated by the hanford nuclear reactors which produced 
plutonium for the nations atomic weapons 
ms gebbie disclosed the states preliminary assessment of the 
potential hazard in response to questions from reporters after a 
meeting with energy secretary james d watkins ms gebbie is 
chairman of a panel of experts advising watkins on ways to 
restructure and improve the departments health research activities 
she provided no details of the preliminary study of the tank

a soviet lawmaker said tuesday that sending the 
army into the caucasus to deal with feuding armenians and 
azerbaijanis puts mikhail gorbachevs perestroika policy to its 
toughest test 
we think that perestroika is now experiencing its most serious 
and most dangerous period said sergei stankievich a member of 
the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
i think it is one of the most serious setbacks he said in 
an interview from moscow with britains commercial television 
channel 4 news 
stankievich added however that he considered the move 
necessary to stabilize a volatile situation and eventually would 
bring both sides to the negotiating table 
speaking in english he said there was danger in using the army 
in azerbaijan because it might then have to be used elsewhere to 
put down uprisings in other soviet republics contending with ethnic 
disputes or proindependence movements 
it is a real danger for us since we have unrest in many 
regions of the country we should avoid the possibility of making 
the army the universal tool of perestroika in other regions he 
said 
stankievich said the unrest in azerbaijan and the baltic 
republics presented a real danger of perestroika being derailed 
but we think as soon as we have a real breakthrough in our 
economy as soon as we show we are very serious in our devotion to 
radical political reform then ethnic tension can be eased he 
said 
stankievich was described in the program as a radical lawmaker 
for moscow and a critic of gorbachev he explained that he and 
those who think like him are critical in general of gorbachevs 
inconsistency and devotion to halfmeasures 
we hope gorbachev will survive in this very intensive conflict 
and that he will make his choice in favor of further changes we 
shall support him in his reform efforts and we shall defend him 
against any conservative attack stankievich said 
he was asked by interviewer david smith if politicians like 
him who enjoy great popular support would now rally behind 
gorbachev 
we have no other way out but to use the army to stabilize the 
situation in order to stop bloody violence in our caucasus 
stankievich said of the unrest which has left at least 56 people 
dead 
we cannot stand aside from all this we cannot be only 
eyewitnesses because the lives of thousands of people are at stake 
so we should react and use state force but we should try to find 
some form of interethnic reconciliation 
the legislator said he favored creation of a new autonomous 
republic with its own government for armenians inside azerbaijan in 
the disputed region of nagornokarabakh with new opportunities 
for the development of armenian culture there 
stankievich said gorbachev missed the best time for such a 
solution which was at least two years ago when violence first 
developed between the two communities

the military airlift command has removed 
restrictions barring women from being crew members on cargo airdrop 
missions an air force spokesman said tuesday 
women now may serve as pilots copilots loadmasters flight 
engineers or crew chiefs on c130 or c141 transport planes said 
air force capt george sillia women earlier had been barred from 
serving as crew members on airdrop missions 
the decision will affect about 100 women among its 4800 pilots 
and a like number of women among enlisted crew members sillia said 
previously women crew members were allowed to fly on c141 
aircraft to a specific location unload the cargo and return 
however women had not been allowed to be crew members on the 
c130 except the wc130 a weather reconnaissance plane 
the decision was made dec 14 six days before the us invasion 
of panama during which army women were reported to have taken part 
in combat sillia said the intervention delayed the formal 
announcement 
the command determined that airdrop missions dont fall under 
the defense departments february 1988 risk rule which says a 
noncombat mission or unit can be closed to women if officials deem 
that the risks are equal to or greater than those of the combat 
mission they support 
during the panama fighting army capt linda bray directed a 
successful raid by her military police company on a dog kennel 
defended by panamanian defense forces in a widely reported incident 
that renewed the debate over the role of women in the military 
federal law prohibits women from serving in combat units in the 
air force and navy while army regulations ban such activity in 
that service however some members of congress have called for a 
change in policy 
on tuesday barbara bush said it would be fine with her for 
women to serve in combat if they were physically strong enough 
because certainly emotionally and mentally they are more than 
able to compete with a man 
the crew change is a result of the commands review of 
recommendations in the defense departments february 1988 report 
task force on women in the military 
all positions are continually being reviewed sillia said 
were trying to open as many as possible

iranian president hashemi rafsanjani 
survived an assassination attempt by a bodyguard this month 
reportedly the second such incident since october an informed 
source said tuesday 
the source a tehran resident speaking from a european capital 
by telephone said he learned of the attempt about two weeks ago 
from a presidential bodyguard 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said another of 
rafsanjanis bodyguards tried to shoot the president but was 
overpowered by two men before he could pull the trigger the two 
men were injured when the gun went off he added but rafsanjani 
escaped unharmed 
the source had no other details 
there has been no mention of the attempt in the news media of 
the islamic republic or by iranian dissident groups usually quick 
to report any sign of instability within the leadership 
powerful radicals within the iranian government who believe 
rafsanjanis pragmatic policies pollute the pure islamic ideals 
preached by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini have been openly 
attacking his policies 
former interior minister ali akbar montashemi leader of the 
radical camp and rafsanjanis most formidable foe was dumped by 
rafsanjani when he formed his new cabinet in august 
sources say rivalry between the two has exacerbated since 
mohtashemi secured the tehran seat in last months parliamentary 
elections 
the reported attack was followed by a crackdown on ayatollah ali 
montazeri once khomeinis designated successor and now one of the 
governments staunchest critics 
the source said shopkeepers in the holy city of qom montazeris 
home town went on strike after the senior cleric was arrested for 
a few hours 
the iranian opposition group mujahedeen khalq had reported 
montazeris arrest jan 6 but said he was released after several 
hours when tension mounted in the city 
rafsanjani 55 reportedly survived an earlier similar 
assassination attempt by another bodyguard last october at a press 
conference with foreign reporters in tehran rafsanjani denied 
there had been an attempt to assassinate him for several years 
the attack was reported to have followed a secret meeting by 
rafsanjani and his cabinet during which a plan was suggested to 
pull the country out of the economic doldrums 
last week irans supreme spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei who supports rafsanjani delivered a stern warning to the 
radicals to stop undermining the governments efforts to improve 
political and economic conditions in the country 
khamenei whose commandments as spiritual leader are considered 
religioulsy binding threatened to act in all instances when 
his orders were not obeyed 
he called those who did not abide by his commandment 
traitors and said efforts to undermine rafsanjanis government 
amounted to national treachery

twenty masked and armed attackers on tuesday 
night rushed into a hut in a vietnamese boat people detention 
center and attacked those inside killing one and injuring seven 
police said wednesday 
police quickly brought the situation under control but no 
arrests were reported a police investigation was launched 
one of those injured was hospitalized 
a police source speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
because the detention center is a closed camp authorities believe 
the attackers are also boat people living in other huts 
in the past months many fights erupted in the camps with boat 
people using iron bars swords and lances as weapons 
about 56000 vietnamese boat people now are housed in squalid 
camps in hong kong about 12000 of them arrived before june 1988 
and are considered refugees eligible for resettlement but the rest 
arrived later and are being screened if they are classified as 
illegal immigrants they must either go home voluntarily or be 
repatriated by force to vietnam 
on dec 12 hong kong repatriated 51 boat people against their 
wishes 
in london on tuesday british lawmakers lord ennals and timothy 
raison said they found no evidence of force in that repatriation 
and no evidence that those sent back were persecuted on their 
return 
ennals and raison both former cabinet ministers said in a 
report that the involuntary return involved an element of 
overkill in the police presence and equipment used before departure 
and on board the aircraft 
however they said they reported finding no evidence of force 
being used and said it was the method of return to which the boat 
people objected 
the two visited vietnam last week at the british governments 
request 
they said they found in every case that the motives of the 51 
repatriates for going to hong kong were economic 
ennals told a news conference he was unhappy about further 
forcible repatriation raison said it was important to show 
vietnamese they could not go to hong kong a british colony in 
hopes of moving on elsewhere 
britain has decided that many boat people went to hong kong to 
seek a higher standard of living and not to escape political 
persecution 
on monday amnesty international criticized the hong kong 
governments treatment of boat people accusing police and security 
forces of beating them the human rights organization said 
investigations of official brutality were quashed by the agencies 
involved 
britain and hong kong called the report unfounded and denied any 
brutality

a teenage mother who was jailed 
with her infant daughter after pleading guilty to 10 theft charges 
celebrated her release tuesday at a champagne reception 
i only hope the future holds happiness for me said tracey 
scott 19 who had admitted she let friends walk out without paying 
for their goods at the huddersfield supermarket where she worked as 
a cashier 
court of appeal judges on monday suspended a sixmonth sentence 
given to ms scott by northern circuit court judge james pickles 
who said he wanted to deter women from getting pregnant to avoid 
jail 
ms scott who was not in court monday appeared at a brief 
hearing before the appeal judges in london on tuesday and agreed to 
serve two years probation 
lord lane the lord chief justice told her pickles should have 
put her on probation rather than send her to jail 
he said monday pickles had been told before he sentenced ms 
scott that two women he had jailed for stealing from the store had 
been freed on appeal yet he said pickles insisted that for 
helping them to loot the store ms scott deserved a custodial 
sentence 
at a party given by neighbors in huddersfield 160 miles north 
of london ms scott said she wanted to see her lawyer before 
commenting on pickles or the two weeks she spent in jail with her 
3monthold daughter alesha 
its just great to be home she said the first thing i 
did was have a bath it was wonderful 
ms scott said she did not know that she had won her appeal 
until she was in court tuesday her attorney ken green said it 
was disgusting that no one told her she had won her appeal 
green said she was very bitter toward pickles she hopes the 
highlighting of her case will direct attention to other mothers and 
babies who are in prison he said 
ms scott claimed tuesday night that mothers were denied proper 
medical help for their sick babies at styal womens prison in 
cheshire in northwest england where she was jailed 
when she arrived at styal she said some of the babies there had 
been suffering from diarrhea for up to two weeks she said a prison 
doctor had examined them and declared they were all right 
some of the mothers were hysterical she said every feed 
for the sick babies was coming up they couldnt keep it down the 
women were desperate for some outside medical help they needed 
proper medical advice it was worrying 
a home office spokesman who by custom was not identified said 
it was not the departments policy to discuss individual cases 
pickles 64 said he didnt want the mother and child to be 
separated he said that while he didnt accuse ms scott of getting 
pregant to avoid going to prison he was afraid other women might 
get that idea 
lord lane said when he quashed the sentence that pickles seems 
to us to have been concerned more with the public import of what he 
was doing and saying rather than the justice of it 
pickles is one of britains most outspoken judges and frequently 
draws controversy for his sentencing 
last year he jailed a woman who was too frightened to testify 
against a man accused of beating her up in january he opted for 
probation for a child molester saying the man would have been 
picked on by bullies in prison and that the arrest and court 
appearance would likely have a chastening effect 
pickles a judge since 1976 insists he is humane he twice 
delayed sentencing ms scott until he was sure a place was 
available for her and the baby in youth custody where conditions 
are less strict 
pickles reportedly was out of the country on vacation and has 
declined to comment on the case

east germany opened criminal investigations 
tuesday into protesters who stormed secret police headquarters and 
the nations police chief said demand for reform must not turn into 
something resembling civil war 
warning strikes for higher pay and faster reform hit several 
cities twinned with a condemnation of the government decision to 
raise prices 
in bonn the west german capital chancellor helmut kohl bowed 
to pressure and scrapped plans to sign an agreement on closer ties 
with communist premier hans modrows caretaker government before 
east germanys may 6 elections 
even members of kohls own coalition said signing of such an 
agreement must wait until a democratically elected government takes 
over after free elections 
kohl told a news conference immediate on tuesday that help is 
needed for east germanys ailing economy adding that the 
situation in the german democratic republic had gotten more 
difficult 
the east germany communist party daily neues deutschland called 
it a street revolution and national police chief dieter 
winderlich said of mondays storming of secret police headquarters 
we have to do everything so that the reform process can go 
forward with the peaceful means that have characterized it to date 
to keep it from resulting in occurrences resembling civil war 
hundreds of thousands of east germans took to the streets monday 
to step up pressure against the communists with protesters at the 
secret police building also breaking into the counterespionage area 
the conservative die welt daily newspaper said in bonn that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was expected in east berlin 
in two or three weeks it said gorbachev himself the target of 
domestic unrest plans a massive show of support for his 
longtime friend modrow 
east germanys sprawling secret police headquarters in east 
berlin on tuesday remained under control of a citizens 
committee regular police and government representatives after 
monday nights rampage 
east berlin prosecutor gerhard krueger said he was assigned by 
the nations top law enforcement official to investigate the most 
serious incidents during the storming 
krueger said possible charges included hooliganism theft 
trespass and serious damage to property he said the government was 
trying to enlist opposition groups in close cooperation to 
track down suspects 
the government has pledged to dismantle the secret police but 
opposition leaders still express doubt it will follow through 
many protesters monday night looted the building carrying away 
clothing wine and equipment 
some also broke into the section for counterespionage 
activities but did not succeed in discovering the identities of 
the sections workers winderlich said 
he put the number of people who stormed the complex at 50000 
and estimated damage in the hundreds of thousands of dollars 
the morning after the rampage east germans staged spontaneous 
work stoppages in several east german cities west germanys 
zdftv network reported east germanys state television also 
reported warning strikes 
zdf showed film of a public transport walkout in gera a city 
about 110 miles south of east berlin workers at a stateowned 
factory in the southern city also reportedly staged a sixhour 
strike 
the people were using the warning strikes to protest against 
the policies of the communist party and its stilllasting influence 
in the factories zdf said the strikers especially criticized 
the dismantling of the state subsidies at the current time 
the new government has started abolishing price subsidies by 
raising prices for childrens clothes and related articles the 
government says apartment rents and costs of other essentials also 
will rise 
the sacred cow has been slaughtered the government declared 
in ending price subsidies which have held down prices of goods 
services and housing for decades 
modrow himself has condemned warning strikes saying the economy 
must run without disturbances to pull out of an increasingly 
serious slump 
neues deutschland said organizers of protests like that at the 
secret police headquarters must accept responsibility for the 
consequences 
responsibility also means means having a clear idea about 
consequences before calling for a demonstration so that things 
dont get out of hand the newspaper said in a frontpage 
editorial 
the call for no violence which has marked the street 
revolution from the start becomes a farce when emotions break 
through the bounds of reason 
opposition leaders issued appeals for calm and urged 
demonstrators to avoid further violence

federal troops on tuesday set fire 
to hundreds of thousands of confiscated amazon animal skins valued 
at 100 million to conclude a yearlong government crackdown 
against smugglers officials said 
nearly a halfmillion furs and leather products including 
purses belts and womens shoes were destroyed in 15 states in 
brazils largest burning of valuable skins in 20 years said 
fernando cesar mesquita president of the brazilian institute of 
the environment and renewable resources 
in rio de janeiro troops with flame throwers torched about 
100000 jaguar crocodile monkee deer cobra and wolf skins 
valued at 4 million as journalists ecologists and federal 
authorities watched 
this is to show people we mean business and to teach them to 
respect the environment mesquita said in a telephone interview 
from brasilia the capital 
most of the skins were confiscated from brazilian and foreign 
ships and planes destined for united states canada asia and 
europe he said 
in one raid 70000 skins were seized as they were unloaded at 
the narita international airport in japan mesquita said 
he said federal police are searching for a japanese man believed 
to have arranged the shipment of 40000 rare amazonian animal skins 
to tokyo 
one of the problems is that its sometimes difficult to know 
the difference between a lion skin and jaguars said mesquita 
you dont know if what shows up in stores is contraband or not 
he said the burning symbolized a renewed government effort to 
stop poachers and preserve brazils tropical forests and the 
variety of plant and animal species unique to the jungle 
since the late 1970s at least 5 percent of the 
2millionsquaremile amazonian rain forest has been cut and burned 
by locals trying to make a living farming in the region the 
government says 
in that time the number of animal reptile and insect species 
threatened by extinction has risen from 83 to 250 according to the 
latest figures from last year he said 
people need to know what is happening to our fauna said 
mesquita law enforcement is far below what is needed

a convict who abducted and killed two 
teenagers and then ate their lunch was pushed closer toward the 
gas chamber tuesday when the us supreme court refused to hear the 
death row inmates appeal 
todays action by the united states supreme court makes it 
almost certain that robert alton harris will be the first murderer 
executed in california in some 23 years state attorney general 
john van de kamp said at a news conference 
harris 37 was convicted in march 1979 in san diego of shooting 
john mayeski 15 and his friend michael baker 16 nine months 
earlier so he could use the boys car for a bank robbery 
the supreme court rejected arguments that among other things a 
sentencing jury wrongly was urged to consider harris age and 
mental condition as factors pointing to death as the proper 
punishment 
tuesdays action marked the fourth time the nations highest 
court has acted in the harris case since 1981 during more than a 
decade of appeals in state and federal courts 
a hearing is expected within two weeks in san diego superior 
court to set an execution date for harris who could be the first 
inmate put to death in california since 1967 when aaron mitchell 
was led screaming to san quentins gas chamber and executed for the 
killing of a sacramento policeman 
if no more stays are granted in the meantime harris could be 
executed toward the end of march or early april van de kamp said 
however defense lawyers charles sevilla and michael mccabe have 
a new habeas corpus petition before the california supreme court 
among other things it contains praise for harris from fellow 
prisoners and two prison guards and argues that his progress in 
prison shows the falsity of a psychologists testimony at his trial 
that harris could never be rehabilitated 
i urge the courts grant no further stays of execution the 
attorney general said hes trying to stay alive literally by 
pingponging back and forth between the various court systems 
there has to be some kind of end to that 
these endless appeals and delays make a mockery of justice 
van de kamp said 
the defense attorneys issued a statement saying they were 
disappointed by the supreme courts action they said their appeal 
filed last november raised serious issues we believed undermined 
the constitutionality of the conviction and punishment 
deputy attorney general louis hanoian who is handling the 
appellate phase for the state said there was nothing really new in 
the latest defense petition in state court 
i dont believe for a minute he has reformed hanoian said 
he hasnt changed 
according to court records harris and his brother daniel 
decided to steal a car to use as their getaway vehicle in a 1978 
bank robbery they abducted mayeski and baker while the boys sat in 
a car at a san diego drivein taking them and their car to a 
remote area near miramar lake 
daniel harris who testified for the prosecution said his 
brother shot mayeski then baker he said they then used the boys 
car in a bank robbery he said robert harris later laughed about 
shooting the boys while eating the meals they never finished

panama said tuesday it is expelling 
perus senior diplomat because of scornful remarks made by peruvian 
leaders following the us invasion and perus delay in recognizing 
the new government here 
in lima the peruvian government said it had protested panamas 
decision but would maintain its diplomatic mission in panama city 
deputy foreign minister juan m castulovich of panama said its 
decision did not signify a break in diplomatic relations 
the diplomatic missions are being maintained they are not 
closing he said 
he said peruvian charge daffaires luis sandiga cabrera was 
given 72 hours to leave the country and panama is recalling its 
charge daffaires in lima 
recent statements by peruvian authorities make normal 
relations between the two countries difficult castulovich said 
peruvian foreign minister guillermo larco cox said in a 
communique in lima that peru will reduce diplomatic personnel in 
pamana city but will keep its embassy open with a first secretary 
to insure the safety of 12 panamanians who sought refuge in the 
peruvian ambassadors residence last week 
two of those panamanians are sought by us authorities 
president alan garcia of peru has been one of the strongest 
latin american critics of the dec 20 us invasion of panama that 
led to the overthrow and arrest of gen manuel antonio noriega and 
his transfer to miami where he is awaiting trial on drug 
trafficking charges in federal court 
larco cox has called president guillermo endara an opposition 
leader sworn in as panamas president hours after the invasion 
began the judas of central america 
peru earlier had recalled its ambassador to panama to protest 
noriegas refusal to respect endaras election victory last may 7 
us troops have ringed the peruvian nicaraguan and cuban 
missions in panama city in which noriega relatives aides and 
associates sought refuge 
noriega opponents have been holding demonstrations outside 
demanding surrender of the refugees noriega himself spent 10 days 
in temporary refuge at the vatican embassy before the popes 
diplomats persuaded him to give himself up jan 3 to american 
troops 
panamanians granted peruvian asylum include gonzalo gonzales a 
close associate of noriega and his former chief of security and 
maj heraclides sucre accused of executing maj moises giroldi a 
leader of an oct 3 abortive coup attempt against noriega both men 
are wanted by us authorities 
perus action in granting asylum to all 12 panamanians inside 
the residence drew sharp objections from panamanian officials 
castulovich said perus request for safe conduct for those in 
the residence depended on whether the government had charges to 
file 
earlier tuesday larco cox told an impromptu news conference 
peru would give all panamanian diplomats in peru 72 hours to leave 
after which they will lose all their diplomatic rights and 
immunity 
the communique did not explain the change in perus position 
but the aim appeared to be to insure the diplomatic protection of 
of the panamanians inside the residence 
in another development tuesday leaders of the democratic 
revolutionary party that supported noriegas regime surfaced to 
announce they will organize as a democratic opposition to 
endaras government and publicly asked for the immediate withdrawal 
of the us military from panama

a 5yearold centreville boy who fell 
through ice and was submerged for 40 minutes has only a slim chance 
for a full recovery one of the doctors treating him said tuesday 
police said george sader was playing with other children on the 
ice of a drainage pond in the washington suburb of centreville when 
it broke monday 
most of his major organs suffered from the insult of being 
without any oxygen and blood flow for a prolonged period of time 
said dr craig futterman a pediatric internist at fairfax hospital 
the boy requires quite a bit of effort to keep him stable 
futterman added 
among the organs damaged were the brain liver and lungs the 
doctor said were going to have problems with brain swelling 
his heart has done surprisingly well considering the 
circumstances futterman said 
he said the boy had a 1 to 2 percent chance of a full 
recovery 
another pediatrician gary kavit said it would be days or weeks 
before doctors could determine the extent of brain damage 
in recent years doctors have learned that young children often 
can survive prolonged periods submerged in cold water because their 
heartbeat and brain activity are drastically slowed the colder the 
water and the younger the child the better the chances of 
survival adults have lost the reflex that makes the bodily 
processes slow down 
though paramedics performed cpr cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
doctors were unable to start the boys heart once he arrived at the 
hospitals emergency room his body temperature was 90 degrees 
fahrenheit 
he was hooked up to a heartlung machine so his blood could be 
warmed outside the body 
two girls with young sader vivian daniel 12 and carol zakkak 
14 his cousin fell in trying to rescue him but were not seriously 
injured authorities said

an army colonel three 
lieutenants and four soldiers implicated in the massacre of six 
jesuit priests were brought before a civilian judge tuesday to make 
statements about the slayings 
col guillermo benavides arrived at the downtown office of 4th 
penal court judge ricardo zamora in dress uniform and surrounded by 
police he made no comment to reporters who were kept several 
yards away 
the lieutenants two sergeants a corporal and a soldier also 
implicated in the nov 16 massacre arrived moments later a ninth 
soldier who allegedly took part in the slayings deserted last month 
and is a fugitive 
zamora has 72 hours to decide if there is enough evidence to 
charge the men and hold them for trial 
president alfredo cristiani on saturday said the men were the 
prime suspects in the massacre which also took the life of a cook 
and her 15yearold daughter 
the suspects have been under arrest at several unidentified 
military and police garrisons in the capital 
cristiani told abctvs good morning america on tuesday that 
benavides denies ordering the slayings 
but the junior officers involved expressly have testified that 
they received a direct order from him cristiani said 
all the suspects except the colonel are members of the elite 
atlacatl infantry battalion the atlacatl unit was attached the 
military college at the time of the massacre benavides is director 
of the college 
benavides is the highest ranking military officer to be accused 
of a crime of human rights abuse in the 10yearold civil war 
no military officer has been convicted of rights abuse in the 
civil war even though rightist death squads sponsored or tolerated 
by the armed forces killed thousands of suspected leftists in the 
early 1980s 
the killings of the jesuit priests shocked el salvador and the 
world and prompted calls in the us congress for reappraisal of 
the more than 1 million washington supplies daily in aid to this 
central american nation 
the slain jesuits were also professors the leadership of the 
central american university or uca one of the regions top 
colleges they were murdered five days after rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front launched their biggest 
offensive of the war 
the farright had long considered the uca jesuits subversive 
ideologues because of their position that the civil war was the 
result of gross social injustice rather than international 
communist expansion

christian radio and television stations 
suspended their newscasts tuesday to protest a threat by christian 
gen michel aoun to close them down if they continue to refer to 
president elias hrawi as head of state 
voice of lebanon of the rightist phalange party and voice of 
free lebanon of the lebanese forces militia broadcast a directive 
from aoun saying the media should not refer to hrawi as president 
or to prime minister salim hoss as head of government 
the directive said hrawi was merely a former member of 
parliament and noted that the general declared the legislature 
dissolved nov 4 to prevent the election of a head of state 
after the broadcast the radio stations said they were 
suspending their hourly newscasts and abstaining from reporting 
the news until a way is found to cope with the new directive 
announcers at the stations indicated they viewed the directive 
as an attempt to gag the press and introduce censorship 
they were later joined by the lebanese broadcasting corp the 
nations widest viewed television station operated by the lebanese 
forces which said it was suspending its two evening newscasts 
until further notice 
the media in lebanon reflect a broad spectrum of political 
thought and take pride in being among the freest in the arab world 
despite the 14yearold moslemchristian civil war 
aoun issued the directive in his capacity as information 
minister of an interim military cabinet he has headed since sept 
22 1988 when president amin gemayels term expired with 
parliament unable to elect a successor 
he later summoned newspaper editors to the bunker of the 
presidential palace and said he would expel from the christian 
enclave anyone failing to abide by his directive broadcast editors 
were not called 
i am going to apply the law against anyone who doesnt abide 
by this directive if you want to refer to hrawi as the president 
you better pack and leave to the other side if you want to stay on 
here then you have to abide by my legitimacy aoun told the 
editors 
excerpts of the meeting in which he frequently interrupted the 
editors when they protested his measures were broadcast by aouns 
channel5 tv station 
the army command of gen emile lahoud who owes allegiance to 
hrawis government responded by warning the media against obeying 
aouns directive or reporting any of his activity calling him an 
imposter 
the aoun command has no legal power newspapers and other 
news organizations are hereby warned against publishing its

vice premier and finance minister shimon peres 
will meet with egypts president hosni mubarak in cairo on jan 24 
to try to break the stalemate in the middle east peace process 
israel television said wednesday 
next sunday peres will leave for czechoslovakia to meet 
officials there the state television said 
it would be the first toplevel israelegypt encounter since 
defense minister yitzhak rabins talks with mubarak in cairo in 
september 1989 
peres aides could not be reached for comment despite repeated 
phone calls 
earlier israeli media reports said us secretary of state 
james a baker iii may act as host at trilateral talks later this 
week with rabin and foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt 
abdelmeguid met unexpectedly with baker in washington on 
tuesday 
abdelmeguid said later a date still cannot be set for the first 
stage of negotiations on the future of the west bank and the gaza 
strip occupied by israel since 1967 but said some progress has 
been achieved 
baker plans to meet rabin of peres leftleaning labor party 
on thursday 
peres clashed this month with his coalition partner and 
political rival prime minister yitzhak shamir of the hardline 
likud bloc peres threatened to break up the governing coalition if 
the impasse continues in the peace process 
in a policy statement broadcast by israel radio tuesday peres 
listed four conditions israel should meet to start preliminary 
negotiations with the palestinians who have waged a revolt against 
israeli rule in the occupied lands for 25 months 
peres said israel should agree to participation of two deported 
palestinians in the palestinian delegation to such talks and 
should not limit the agenda to a proposal to hold elections in the 
occupied territories the palestinians should consult any party 
they see fit he said 
finally we should be content with the us assurances we 
got since additional assurances would not give us anything 
peres said 
shamir opposes the first three suggestions seeing in them an 
attempt to bring in the plo through the back door israel views the 
palestine liberation organization as a terrorist group and 
officially refuses to negotiate with it 
shamir wants firm us assurances the plo would be excluded from 
participation in the peace talks and is not content with a draft 
document with such guarantees provided by baker this month 
in addition shamir wants the talks limited to his offer of 
holding elections in the occupied territories this idea envisages 
talks with elected representatives over a fiveyear trial period of 
autonomy for the 17 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza 
baker is trying to arrange a threeway meeting with abdelmeguid 
and israels foreign minister moshe arens in washington to set 
israelipalestinian talks in motion the question of plo 
participation remains the main stumbling block 
egyptian officials including abdelmeguid denied they had any 
plans for a tripartite meeting with rabin at present israeli 
foreign ministry officials refused to comment 
but some likud officials said it was possible and israel 
army radio quoted peres as saying tuesday he strongly supports 
the idea 
some israeli reports suggested bakers hastened pace was an 
attempt to pressure shamir the conservative maariv daily the 
prolabor davar newspaper and the state radio tuesday quoted 
unidentified state department officials as telling american jewish 
leaders israel was holding up peace efforts with petty 
bargaining 
us senate minority leader bob dole rkansas on tuesday 
proposed cutting us foreign aid to israel egypt and other 
largest recipients by 5 percent and switching the money to eastern 
europe and panama 
israel gets 3 billion a year and is the top recipient of us 
foreign aid 
no immediate comment came from israel but the tv quoted 
concerned officials as saying it was the first time a proposed cut 
in us aid seemed to enjoy white house support 
in washington the israeli embassy issued a statement noting 
that the winds of change that blew across eastern europe 
failed to reach the middle east and the dangers israel faces have 
even increased 
cutting military assistance to israel at this delicate stage 
of the peace process will send a negative message cutting economic 
assistance at a time israel gears itself toward the absorption of 
hundreds of thousands of jewish immigrants would make it almost 
impossible to meet this challenge

syria on tuesday said all reports about 
withdrawal of soviet military advisers from syria are untrue 
an informed syrian source said monday on condition of 
anonymity that the withdrawal of a number of soviet military 
advisers was agreed on during a visit by syrian defense minister 
mustafa tlass to moscow last month 
responding information minister mohammed salman said 
some news agencies have circulated information concerned with 
the soviet experts in syria all the talk about this subject is 
absolutely untrue 
the source said tlass negotiated the issue with members of the 
soviet unions supreme military council but the source denied 
press reports in israel that withdrawal of soviet personnel was in 
the thousands 
the source declined to comment on a report in the kuwaiti 
newspaper alrai alaam that the number of soviet military advisers 
had already dropped from 2000 to just over 1000 
the 198990 military balance a annual survey of global military 
strengths published by the londonbased international institute for 
strategic studies put the number of soviet military personnel in 
syria last year at 2000

military equality with israel so that it can negotiate from a 
position of strength 
the soviets have supplied syria with combat jets tanks and a 
missile capability which includes a powerful air defense network 
and 18 surfacetosurface ss21 missiles capable of reaching any

gov michael s dukakis in his final state of the 
state speech said tuesday that he hadnt anticipated the damage 
his presidential campaign would have on massachusetts and his 
family 
dukakis said he was swept up by the excitement and euphoria 
of what he called the massachusetts miracle when he ran for the 
democratic presidential nomination 
but a funny thing happened on the road to the white house i 
ran a great campaign for the nomination and a lousy one for the 
final dukakis said i lost and in the process massachusetts 
took an unfair beating and i feel terrible about it 
dukakis said he underestimated the demands of running for the 
presidency and managing state affairs 
its clear to me now that i underestimated the amount of time 
and energy it takes to seek the modern presidency trying to do two 
jobs at the same time was more difficuilt and more grueling than i 
expected he said 
and i underestimated the toll it would take on my family 
too 
his wife kitty entered an alcoholism treatment program shortly 
after his defeat 
dukakis 56 announced a year ago he would not seek reelection 
his third fouryear term expires at the end of 1990 
he also said he was wrong in trying to expand government in his 
fiscal year 1990 budget instead of consolidating it and trying to 
make it work better the state legislature still has not balanced 
the states 12 billion budget which remains about 500 million in 
the red 
i wish tonight instead of delivering a state of the state 
address i could sit down and talk with each and every one of you 
and restore the bond that was broken during the campaign a bond 
that over a quartercentury of public service i treasure more than 
you know dukakis said 
i know that many of you are angry with me feel betrayed feel 
that i put myself before you and the commonwealth dukakis said 
but there comes a time and i believe it has arrived that 
nobodys interest and certainly not the publics is served by 
laying on more blame dukakis said in a speech that was 
conciliatory in tone and upbeat about the states future 
dukakis repeated his call for new taxes to solve the states 
nagging fiscal problems but said he was optimistic about the 
longterm future of both massachusetts and of new england both 
suffering economic declines 
i think we have a great future ahead of us if we stop singing 
the blues and go to work together to make things happen in the 
1990s dukakis said 
dukakis also made a oneparagraph reference to the nationally 
publicized case of charles stuart who allegedly plotted the 
slaying of his pregnant wife and tried to pin the crime on a black 
man before committing suicide 
dukakis said one of the goals for the coming years would be to 
help heal the wounds that have been reopened by the violence and 
deception of one man wounds that have caused us to look deeply 
once again into our feelings about each other and our community

despite claims of progress egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid said tuesday that a date still cannot 
be set for the first stage of negotiations on the future of the 
israeliheld west bank and gaza 
we are still discussing it abdelmeguid said after an 
hourlong meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii 
the main stumbling block to such negotiations is a dispute over 
whether the palestine liberation organization will have any role in 
the discussions intended to lead to elections to chose palestinian 
leaders 
as the first step baker hopes to hold a threeway session here 
with meguid and israeli foreign minister moshe arens 
there is no doubt that egypt is very much in favor of keeping 
on with the peace process abdelmeguid said and we see that 
already a lot has been achieved during what i call the first 
phase 
egypt and israel last month agreed in principle to meet in 
washington but both governments expressed reservations israel 
wants to shut out the plo while egypt is trying to secure its 
influence in the proceedings 
i had a very interesting and useful discussion with secretary 
baker and we are going to see each other again and then maybe at 
the end of the visit probably on friday ill have something more 
to say the foreign minister said 
abdelmeguid met with baker without any public announcement the 
foreign minister was accompanied by osama albaz a foreign policy 
adviser to egyptian president hosni mubarak 
the egyptian delegation is in washington to discuss with 
officials of the international monetary fund that nations massive 
foreign debt which the world bank put at 4997 billion at the end 
of 1988 egypt has been negotiating for more than a year on a loan 
from the fund 
baker plans to meet thursday with israeli defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
asked if that session might develop into a threeway meeting 
abdelmeguid replied i dont have that plan 
the staterun israel television said tuesday that shimon peres 
vicepremier and finance minister would meet mubarak in cairo next 
week peres has been threatening to break up israels governing 
political coalition if the stalemate in peaceseeking continues 
baker has conducted most of his diplomacy with cairo and 
jerusalem by telephone the dealings have left him frustrated and 
he has warned the parties that problems in other parts of the world 
were demanding his attention 
egypt the only arab nation to sign a peace treaty with israel 
is serving as a channel to the plo

solvenias party leadership demanded 
tuesday that yugoslavias ruling league of communists transform 
itself into a loose coalition of regional communist parties 
the proposal will be discussed at a national party congress 
scheduled for saturday the state tanjug news agency reported 
if adopted the proposal would radically alter the traditonal 
centralized federal party structure it would significantly reduce 
the power of the national communist party known as the league of 
communists and would grant virtual independence to regional party 
organizations 
it is certain to encounter fierce resistance from hardliners in 
the communist leadership of serbia the largest of yugoslavias six 
constituent republics who still favor strong central control in 
party and state affairs 
the liberal slovenian leadership also reportedly demanded urgent 
changes in electoral laws to fully legalize opposition political 
parties the first democratic multiparty elections in the 
45yearold history of this communist country are tentatively 
planned in slovenia for april 
the proposals came from the slovenian communist partys 
policysetting central committee 
yugoslavia has not formally adopted a law allowing independent 
political parties to form but numerous opposition political groups 
have sprung up throughout the country in the past few months 
yugoslavias communists were the first to break with monolithic 
sovietled communist bloc in 1948 but yugoslavia faced with its 
worst economic and political crises has been slower in adopting 
the westernstyle reforms that have gripped other east european 
countries 
yugoslav media said an expected clash between conservatives and 
reformers at the congress could be crucial in determining the 
countrys future 
some media reports said that if the hardliners prevail several 
liberalminded yugoslav republics might opt for secession from the 
federation 
slovenia is only for a democratic yugoslavia based on the 
achievements of a developed world said peter bekes a member of 
slovenias leadership according to tanjug 
slovenian proposals include release of all political prisoners 
in yugoslavia an immediate end to all political trials and 
changes in the yugoslav legal system which would guarantee full 
respect of human rights 
they also call for immediate talks between communists and 
leaders of the newly formed opposition parties

albanian foreign undersecretary sokrat 
plaka will visit greece this month in an apparent effort to smooth 
strained relations between the two balkan neighbors it was 
officially announced tuesday 
his visit beginning jan 26 comes after charges by the greek 
government and orthodox church of greece that the 400000member 
greek minority in the hardline communist state is deprived of 
human rights 
in albania ethnic greeks are not allowed to practice their 
religion or speak greek in public 
plaka will be the first senior albanian official to travel to 
greece since foreign minister reiz malile paid a goodwill visit in 
april 1988 
greek foreign minister antonis samaras told reporters he will 
hold talks with plaka who requested the visit to athens 
samaras did not disclose what their talks will focus on but it 
was certain the problems faced by ethnic greeks in albania will top 
the agenda 
the greek church in december accused the albanian authorities of 
killing four brothers of greek origin after they were caught trying 
to flee the country albanian officials denied the charge saying 
the brothers are alive and well in their village 
plakas visit also comes amid reports of unrest and that special 
security measures had been imposed in tiny isolated albania 
europes last bastion of stalinism 
but communist leader ramiz alia said persistent foreign reports 
that antigovernment demonstrations were sweeping through the 
country was an attempt to slander albania in a speech to workers 
on tuesday he reiterated that albania will not deviate from its 
communist course

a judges moneysaving move to delay jury 
trials in civil cases has been challenged by two attorneys who said 
their client may die while awaiting his day in court 
judge james okeefe said tuesday his decision to postpone such 
trials came as the north dakota district court system tried to trim 
15 million from its budget after voters rejected tax increases in 
a special election last month 
were trying to slow down the civil trials okeefe said 
we just wont have the money to pay for them 
the move by okeefe who is responsible for an 11county 
judicial district drew a challenge to the north dakota supreme 
court from attorneys for an 80yearold man with cancer 
the man bernhard odden filed a civil lawsuit in 1988 over a 
twovehicle automobile accident that severely injured him and 
killed his wife in november 1986 court documents said 
the lawsuit names as defendants the driver of the other auto 
david paulseth and deutzallis corp which owned the car paulseth 
was driving odden from mchenry county about 100 miles north of 
bismarck was willing to accept a trial without a jury but the 
defendants attorney donald peterson has declined to waive his 
clients right to a jury trial 
the trial was scheduled for jan 29 but oddens lawyers 
michael geiermann and casey chapman were notified recently it was 
being delayed at least 18 months under okeefes policy 
geiermann and chapman want the state supreme court to order a 
trial for odden contending their client who has prostate cancer 
may die before his lawsuit is heard 
the judge in the lawsuit case william neumann said the cost of 
a jury trial could force the firing of the districts only juvenile 
probation officer 
the districts budget has required that the court choose 
betweenserving mr odden or serving onethird of the children and 
youth in the northeast district neumann said the court has 
chosen the young people 
peterson described the delay as a temporary inconvenience 
nothing in the record indicates that he odden is on his 
death bed peterson said in no way is he being denied a jury 
trial nor can it be said that he will suffer irreparable harm 
state government overall has been struggling to cut 94 million 
from its twoyear budget since voters rejected increases in state 
income sales and motor fuels taxes in the special election dec 5 
criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a speedy 
trial and are not affected by okeefes policy

the missouri supreme court on tuesday 
scheduled a thursday morning execution for convicted killer gerald 
smith who says he wants to be put to death 
the state court acted hours after the us supreme court lifted 
a stay of execution tuesday morning for smith 31 after rejecting 
motions by his courtappointed lawyer 
the attorney c john pleban of st louis said he might ask the 
nations highest court to reconsider its 63 decision and will 
review the courts decision to see if anything was overlooked 
however pleban said we are close to being at the end of the 
road here with the appeals process i have pretty much raised all 
the issues i can 
in a telephone conversation later tuesday smith told his 
attorney he didnt want him to try to stop the execution pleban 
said 
the new execution date 1201 am thursday is one week after 
the previous date set by the state court to administer a lethal 
injection to smith for the 1980 murder of former girlfriend karen 
roberts smith is also under a death sentence for murdering a 
fellow deathrow prisoner in 1985 
last weeks execution date was stayed by associate justice harry 
blackmun until the full us supreme court could consider plebans 
motions 
told of the stay being lifted tuesday smith reacted very 
calmly and requested a couple of snickers candy bars and a pepsi 
said prison spokesman dale riley smith has been in an isolation 
cell at the maximumsecurity potosi correctional center since last 
week 
he showed no emotion one way or the other said pleban who 
called smith he didnt say anything really he only inquired as 
to what else i am going to do 
smith has had several stays of execution as he changed his mind 
about whether he wanted to die pleban contends smith is mentally 
incompetent to waive appeals smith said in a jan 6 interview that 
he still wanted to be executed 
the attorney general will fight any request to further delay 
smiths execution said spokeswoman mary jenkins nine years of 
litigation following the trial is sufficient she said 
bob ferguson spokesman for gov john ashcroft said his boss 
would not stop an execution 
smith would be the 121st person executed since the us supreme 
court allowed states to restore the death penalty in 1976 
missouri resumed executions a year ago when george tiny 
mercer was received a lethal injection for murder there are 70 men 
and two women under death sentence in the state

a foreign ministry official said tuesday the first 
official visit to the soviet union by a delegation from japans 
governing party showed a greater willingness by the kremlin to 
resolve a territorial dispute with japan 
but ministry spokesman taizo watanabe discounted published 
reports that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev reversed his 
position on a group of islands claimed by both moscow and tokyo 
i dont think any legalistic talks on who has the right to 
the territories took place he said 
shintaro abe a former foreign minister and exsecretary general 
of the governing liberal democratic party met gorbachev in moscow 
on monday his delegation was the first from the party to visit the 
soviet union at the invitation of the soviet communist party 
in the final days of world war ii soviet troops occupied 
several tiny islands off northeastern japan the socalled northern 
territories which lie across the soviet navys route to the pacific 
ocean from vladivostok the soviets now station troops and jet 
fighters there 
for 45 years the islands have been the major barrier to 
improving relations and the reason the two countries never signed a 
peace treaty 
the asahi shimbun newspaper said tuesday that gorbachev 
reversing his countrys position on the territorial dispute with 
japan said monday that japan has an inherent right to claim 
the islands 
watanabe called that a bold interpretation not backed up by 
gorbachevs statements 
chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama told a news conference 
tuesday there has been a gradual subtle change from the stage 
when the soviet union refused to recognize the problem 
soviet interest in the islands is largely strategic japanese 
considerations include many japanese graves there and the abundance 
in nearby waters of fish seaweed and crab staples of the 
japanese diet 
neither side presented concrete proposals but maverick boris 
yeltsin now visiting japan offered some ideas at a news 
conference tuesday 
he suggested the islands be declared a free enterprise zone in 
three to four years giving japan most favored nation status and 
then demilitarized in seven to eight years 
in 15 to 20 years the islands could be declared an area of 
joint management or free territories not under any countrys 
jurisdiction he said

an international bank pleaded guilty tuesday 
to cocainerelated moneylaundering charges agreed to forfeit a 
record 14 million and to help prosecutors who say the case has 
ties to manuel noriega 
us district judge w terrell hodges accepted pleas from two 
divisions of the luxembourgbased bank of credit and commerce 
international and found them guilty but has not set a date for 
formally imposing the sentence 
the plea did not affect codefendants in the 32 million 
moneylaundering case including top bcci banking officers and two 
colombians the government claims were part of the medellin cocaine 
cartel 
later in the day however one of the six banking officials was 
dropped from the case when conspiracy charges were dismissed the 
other cases continued with pretrial motions in a proceeding 
expected to last five months 
under the agreement signed tuesday bcci sa and bcci overseas 
ltd are to forfeit 14 million in assets frozen earlier by the 
government prosecutors claim that represents profits made from the 
sale of cocaine in american cities and laundered in a series of 
complicated worldwide banking transactions 
the banks also are to receive suspended fines and five years 
probation supervised by the federal reserve 
the cash forfeiture was the largest ever by a financial 
institution in the united states said dave runkel spokesman for 
the us justice department in washington 
i think its a good deal said bonnie tischler head of the 
us customs service in tampa 
but one expert on money laundering said he was surprised and 
disappointed by the sentences against the bank which he 
characterized as lenient 
its pretty outrageous its just a slap on the wrist said 
scott malone washington bureau chief of the newsletter money 
laundering alert all they have to do is return the proceeds of 
their crime and pay no penalty it sends the wrong signal to 
bankers all over the world 
sen john kerry dmass said the penalty was legally morally 
and politically wrong 
my impression is when banks engage knowingly in the laundering 
of money they should be shut down its that simple it really 
is said kerry who chairs the senate subcommittee on terrorism 
and narcotics 
we send drug people to jail for the rest of their life and 
these guys who are bankers in the corporate world seem to just walk 
away and its business as usual kerry told cbs news in an 
interview tuesday 
a twoyear sting operation called operation cchase began in 
tampa in 1986 after an undercover agent conned his way into an 
international money laundering network after that agents helped 
direct profits from cocaine sales in american cities to colombia 
through panama eventually building a global laundering operation 
worth an estimated 32 million investigators said 
some 30 charges against the two bank entities included tax 
fraud laundering activities and failing to report currency 
transactions over 10000 
in return for the plea the government agreed to waive any 
future charges against the bank that its investigation might 
uncover 
hodges approved a gag order to prevent parties in the case from 
talking to the media and bank officials and attorneys refused to 
comment after the agreement was announced 
im going to let the documents speak for themselves us 
attorney robert genzman said after leaving the courtroom 
in december 1987 some officials at bcci in panama which was 
the bank used to pass funds to colombia contacted undercover 
agents and arranged a meeting to suggest alternate banking methods 
such as certificates of deposit rather than checks to avoid being 
caught prosecutors said 
agents said they told high level bank officials the money was 
from cocaine sales 
the agents said bcci bankers taught them how to use cash to buy 
cds then use the cds as collateral for loans the loan proceeds 
then would be wired into accounts controlled by an agent or 
smugglers prosecutors said 
customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for 
colombian drug traffickers including the medellin cartel 
altogether more than 80 people were accused of taking part in 
drugrelated moneylaundering schemes in detroit philadelphia 
chicago los angeles houston miami new york and tampa and in 
london and paris 
the luxembourg bank is one of the largest privately held 
institutions in the world with operations in 73 countries 
facing trial is amjad awan assistant division director of bcci 
for latin america in miami who claimed he used to be deposed 
panamanian dictator noriegas banker and managed a secret account 
that held up to 25 million 
also charged are gonzalo mora jr who federal prosecutors claim 
was the main drug moneylaunderer in medellin colombia and 
rudolph armbrect moras partner 
late tuesday prosecutors agreed to drop charges of conspiracy 
against iqbal ashraf 39 a manager of bccis los angeles office 
after his attorneys moved successfully to suppress statements he 
gave without counsel present 
when we lost that we just didnt have enough evidence left 
said assistant us attorney michael rubenstein 
im relieved a tearful ashraf said as he left court im 
just glad to get this behind me 
the defense asked the court to prohibit prosecutors from 
bringing noriega into the case a move the defense expects because 
stephen michael kalish is among the drug kingpins on the government 
witness list 
kalish arrested in 1984 and serving 15 years has testified 
that he secured safe panama banking for his marijuana smuggling 
ring in 1983 by giving noriega 300000 according to the 
government kalish also met with awan and deposited an initial 2 
million into a bcci account in panama city 
during us senate testimony before his arrest awan said such a 
deposit was possible but he had no recollection of it 
awan told senate investigators he managed a secret account 
noriega opened at the banks panamanian branch in 1982 awan said 
noriega was the only one who could authorize withdrawals from the 
account and he denied knowledge of any drug dealing by noriega or 
the bank

a juror fell ill tuesday while deliberating 
the last 13 counts in the marathon mcmartin preschool molestation 
trial and the panels talks bogged down on questions about a 
conspiracy charge 
it was uncertain whether the juror would be well enough to 
return wednesday to deliberations in the nations longest 
costliest criminal trial 
the jury in its ninth week of deliberations in the 2yearold 
trial attempted tuesday to resolve the question they had raised 
with the court as to whether they could split their verdict on one 
count against both defendants 
the jurors who have been considering a total of 65 molestation 
charges against raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin 
buckey 63 were puzzled about whether they could convict one 
defendant of a conspiracy charge while acquitting the other 
earlier in the day superior court judge william pounders sent 
attorneys to consult their law books while jurors deliberated on 
other counts in the case 
they have agreed on 52 verdicts which have been sealed by 
pounders none of the verdicts is official until it is announced in 
court and affirmed by each juror 
no alternates remain in the case and the judge has expressed 
concern that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a 
mistrial 
pounders responding to a written question submitted friday 
told jurors tuesday they could indeed split their verdict 
the jurors then wanted to know how that could be since the 
conspiracy law calls for conviction if an agreement is entered 
into by two or more persons with a specific intent to commit a 
public offense 
the jurors asked whom one defendant would if conspired with if 
not the other defendant 
pounders suggested telling them that one defendant could have 
conspired with a person or persons whose names are not known 
but defense attorneys objected strenuously 
dean gits who represents mrs buckey said the jurors should be 
instructed that they must agree on the identity of a coconspirator 
even if the person is unidentified in the charges 
danny davis who represents buckey said jurors should not be 
allowed to convict a defendant on the basis of conspiracy with a 
ghost conspirator 
now were saying go for a ghost dont deliberate the 
identity of a conspirator said davis this is not ok for 
raymond buckey 
davis moved for dismissal of the conspiracy charge because of 
insufficient evidence but the judge denied the motion jurors need 
not identify the unidentified coconspirator to agree on a verdict 
the judge said

the five astronauts aboard columbia 
worked quietly in space tuesday only occasionally talking to 
ground controllers as they tended to several scientific and medical 
experiments aboard the shuttle 
radio traffic between ground and the space shuttle was kept to a 
minimum to allow the crew to stay on the timeline and get all 
their various chores accomplished without a lot of interference 
from the folks here mission control said 
their workday began late monday night and ended tuesday shortly 
after noon as the astronauts gradually adjust their workdays 
forward in preparation for fridays 255 am pst landing at 
edwards air force base calif 
on monday the astronauts were so busy with their experiments 
that they went to bed more than two hours late so mission control 
let them sleep an extra half hour but told them in a morning 
package of messages and instructions said your request for 
overtime has been disapproved 
clouds prevented filming parts of earth with the powerful imax 
camera but the astronauts otherwise kept to their schedule tuesday 
well get to bed on time for a change commander dan 
brandenstein told mission control 
the astronauts were awakened at 935 pm est tuesday with an 
instrumental rendition of the irish ballad danny boy in honor 
of bradenstein whose 47th birthday is wednesday 
the music was followed by a salute from the boston celtics 
basketball star larry bird he said congratulations to you and 
the crew on the slam dunk with ldef happy birthday and have a safe 
landing 
the astronaut corps which brandenstein heads then sang happy 
birthday to the boss 
i was hoping that flying mach 25 you didnt age and that this 
wasnt going to happen this year said brandenstein the shuttle 
is traveling at mach 25 or 25 times the speed of sound 
when mission control asked him how old he is brandenstein 
replied didnt you know this is a classified mission 
meanwhile flight controllers reported that the shuttle 
continued to perform well 
columbia launched into orbit a week ago carrying a navy 
communications satellite that was released by the crew last 
wednesday on friday the astronauts executed a dramatic rescue of 
the ldef an 11ton floating scientific satellite that is now 
nestled in the cargo bay for return to earth 
the 10day mission is the second longest in 33 shuttle missions 
and is intended as a stepping stone toward longer missions and 
monthslong stays aboard the planned space station freedom medical 
tests performed during the mission should help scientists learn 
more about how astronauts adapt to space 
one experiment that melts and resolidifies a metal was 
interrupted tuesday when a computer showed it had overheated 
although mission specialist bonnie dunbar said the experiment 
was not hot to touch ground controllers decided to let it have 
some time to cool as a precaution the metal sample will be 
replaced and the experiment will be turned on again wednesday 
earlier in the mission the experiment was shut down temporarily 
when a crack developed in a sealed glass container of the metal 
that sample also was replaced

debate over social security is heating up even 
before congress gets back to business with the trillions of 
dollars in baby boomers future retirement benefits casting a huge 
shadow over the political argument 
customary political rhetoric has been turned upside down with a 
leading democrat calling for a payroll tax cut and the white house 
responding no way 
the outcome may determine whether the massive social security 
trust fund bolstered by longrange payroll tax increases enacted 
in 1983 will continue to be used to mask the size of the federal 
budget deficit in an era of perennial budget shortfalls the 
social security trust fund helps pay the governments daytoday 
operations instead of building up a nest egg 
lawmakers are faced with whether to take painful action now 
such as tax increases and spending slashes or do nothing until 
the next century

its midseason replacement show time folks 
stop grumbling anything is better than televised basketball 
besides theres at least one new sitcom coming up that resembles a 
good one 
its nbcs grand by the makers of the cosby show its 
light years away from that shows severe case of nice the newcomer 
premieres thursday in the time slot opened by the shift of dear 
john to wednesdays 
grand wont bowl you over but it has a nice realistic edge 
to it even better it doesnt depend on a string of oneliners 
posing as a plot it gently exaggerates and deftly both the 
silly and sad for comic effect 
its set in mythical grand pa a small town that we are 
advised prospered and declined around one industry the weldon 
piano works its what you might call a triad comedy 
it tells in what promises to be a serial style the stories of 
three families all of whom know each other theyre in the top 
middle and bottom rungs respectively of the social and economic 
life in this pleasant treefilled fading metropolis 
at the top is the patriarch weldon john randolph with a dim 
son joel murray who having decided to stop thinking goes into 
tv of course there also is a dryhumored old british butler john 
neville whom nothing fazes 
the inbetweens weldons niece bonnie hunt who is hot to 
have a baby and her late thirtysomething husband michael mckean 
who aspires to be an executive in the weldon piano factory 
at the bottom living in a grubby trailer is pamela reed as a 
chainsmoking single mother abandoned three years ago by her 
husband she has an overweight teenage daughter sara rue and a 
young wouldbe beau a motorcycle cop that andrew lauer plays with 
sort of a tommy smothers goofiness 
thursdays debut by grand creator michael leeson is your 
basic meetthecast premiere it tries to get plots going and 
characters outlined but at times all this falls flat usually in 
the dialogue department 
no matter the uncommonly good cast keeps the show afloat 
particularly reed a brilliant stagetrained actress as the tough 
but vulnerable janice pasetti her comedy work has the daring and 
timing of a firstrate burglar 
yet shes equally good with the sad quiet moments as when she 
eagerly awaits the arrival of her wayward husband only to be told 
he wants a divorce no matter what moment is afoot reeds 
character always rings true 
another big plus for grand is its sense of place and heart 
thats wellillustrated in one scene that makes clear that 
pianomaker weldon is a rare bird a man who still takes pride in 
his product 
his newly hired nephewinlaw notes that japanesemade 
electronic keyboards have just about killed the business of making 
what are called acoustic pianos he urges his boss to stop making 
pianos and turn out golf clubs instead 
hundreds of thousands of people play golf the new executive 
says who do you know who plays a piano 
i do roars the old man and he fires him 
you have to like a show that offers such hope 
while this grand premiere has its problems it and two later 
episodes that were made available for screening indicates that this 
is a different superior kind of sitcom give it a try youll like 
it

cheryl ladd doesnt think an actor could ask 
for anything more than the conditions for filming abcs jekyll amp 
hyde on location in london and oxford 
she plays sara the woman dr henry jekyll loves and the woman 
john hyde craves michael caine plays the dual role of good and 
evil 
its one of those wonderful roles that as soon as you go to 
work you become that character said ladd you have authentic 
locales hair styles and costumes the clothes by the way are 
excruciatingly uncomfortable 
although set in victorian england the movie has a theme as 
contemporary as todays headlines jekyll was a man who believed 
that drugs could alter the way men think and act for the 
betterment of mankind and ease the pains of mind and body the 
drugs however create his evil alter ego mr hyde 
the twohour movie which abc telecasts on sunday is based 
loosely on robert louis stevensons classic story the strange 
case of dr jekyll and mr hyde the storys been portrayed many 
times on the screen including fredric marchs oscarwinning 
version in 1932 its also inspired such spinoffs as jerry lewis 
the nutty professor and televisions the incredible hulk 
most recently anthony andrews was in a onehour drama on showtime 
david wickes is the writer and director of the current version 
caine also starred in the recent jack the ripper which wickes 
produced directed and cowrote 
there was no woman to speak of in stevensons story so the 
love interest was created said ladd saras sister had been 
married to jekyll but died five years earlier her father the 
most preeminent medical mind of the day blames jekyll for her 
death because of his experimentation with drugs 
so im sort of caught between that rivalry i try to maintain 
my loyalties to my father and keep my relationship with jekyll 
although shes married she has a very public affair with jekyll my 
husband is a military officer in the south pacific and im packing 
to join him when all hell breaks loose 
ladd said caines transformation from jekyll to hyde is shown on 
the screen by means of stunning special effects 
you watch him change and when he becomes hyde youd never 
know it was michael she said 
ladd probably best known for charlies angels is the only 
american in the cast she plays the role with a british accent 
we were filming one day in a building being used as a 
restaurant she said there were 50 or 60 people in the crew 
people were in and out and security wasnt very tight all day long 
between scenes michael and i posed for press photographers and 
talked to reporters 
at one point a girl rushes in and says the photographers 
waiting we go down the hall and pose for pictures for about 10 
minutes finally we learned he was a tourist who had wandered in 
off the street 
ladd said it was sometimes difficult to keep a straight face 
during the filming 
michael is probably one of the most innately funny people ive 
ever known she said he doesnt tell jokes he just has funny 
ways of speaking but i got him sometimes once when he was in 
complete makeup as hyde and about to rape sara i said how about 
a little foreplay he got the giggles so bad he nearly ruined his 
makeup 
ladd will also be seen in the spring in the feature motion 
picture lisa staci keanan of my two dads stars as lisa and 
ladds daughter in this thriller 
she was due to begin work on an nbc movie called the face of 
love she plays a mother who learns her husband has a daughter 
from the vietnam war when she comes to live with them 
she and john ritter are also developing a remake of our man 
godfrey as a tv movie 
well play against type ladd said ill be flamboyant and 
john will be restrained i get to play this wacko character that 
ive never played before

people make the biggest and in retrospect the most foolish 
mistakes mistakes of such magnitude that simpler folks find them 
incomprehensible 
robert campeau a successful canadian developer whose ambition 
for bigger things brought about the bankruptcy court filing of 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp is the 
latest on a list destined to grow larger 
campeau had what many people would consider everything he 
was highly successful controlling millions of dollars with which 
to indulge himself but he bet it all on something unfamiliar 
retailing and in a foreign country no less 
the explanation for his behavior and the many similarly bright 
people who seem to court disaster might best be explained someday 
by psychological rather than financial analysis but right now it 
is a major mystery 
on the long list are bankers the people you might think should 
know better bankers repeatedly lend money to builders at the wrong 
time in the economic cycle that is when overbuilding is about to 
take place 
bankers also are the decisionmakers who at a time 15 years ago 
when customers couldnt beg a home mortgage lent billions to third 
world nations explaining to simple folks that these loans are 
guaranteed by governments 
it happens often in real estate when successful developers 
eventually come to love and believe the praise they receive at 
groundbreaking ceremonies it lures them into what they believe 
will be their crowning achievement 
so common is the successfailure syndrome in that field that it 
is all but inevitable that sometime somewhere some major 
developer will be caught bringing a commercial building to 
completion just as the market is collapsing 
in stocks and commodities successful speculators let their egos 
talk them into believing they really can see the future a future 
that often involves their biggest deal ever one so sure they cut 
friends in on it 
in business successful small operators get tired of slow 
growth convince themselves that bigger is better borrow madly and 
buy up everything in sight they develop what they call a 
conglomerate each part feeding the other 
financial advisers to corporate raiders dissatisfied with 
earning only commissions see the potential for profit enhancement 
not simply by giving advice but by investing their own money 
too often the result is the same they overstep their abilities 
somehow shielding from consciousness their own failsafe 
mechanisms their instincts and the years of experience that 
brought them their success 
william zeckendorf sr was a flamboyant and successful 
developer famous and feted reputed to be the man to get things 
don when nobody else could he helped put together the land package 
on which the united nations stands 
for years he was honored then he overstepped and failed 
reflecting on his collapsed career he asked a reporter sadly 
did you know they named a park for me in denver the reporter 
checked yes he was told its about the size of a postage 
stamp 
speculators and investment advisers bite the dust all the time 
right after they feel on top of the world the hunt brothers 
garnered a fortune in silver but lost it all when they sought it 
all and joseph granville the investment adviser was so certain 
he knew the future that he missed the crash of 1987 
and there is campeau and his backers all knew that campeau had 
little or no experience in retailing or in the united states 
market and that the risk was so great the deal might collapse if 
sales and profits werent sustained 
they knew also that after one of the longest us economic 
expansions on record a slowdown was inevitable or that at the 
other extreme any reheating of the economy might force up interest 
rates making debt repayment impossible 
those investors included people and institutions who gobbled up 
campeau junk bonds because of the high interest rates even when 
warned again and again that repayment was uncertain 
it included even the investment bankers who issued the warnings

ever since humans began theyve looked for something to blame 
for their problems adam and eve blamed the serpent 
psychiatrists blame childhood traumas astrologists lay it to the 
planets anything but self 
now comes an emerging new culprit the genome 
the genome is the full set of genes or inherited bodily 
regulators that determine much of a persons makeup but just how 
much is a question that casts a shadow on the essence of humanity 
itself 
the mystery of the gene is stimulating a new era of 
philosophical and theological thinking about the nature of human 
life said the rev j robert nelson a noted theologian ecumenist 
and specialist in scientific ethics 
the issue impinges directly on concepts of faith god human 
origins behavior sin and morality he said 
to the extent that it is established that genes not only control 
physical characteristics but also fix certain behavioral traits 
would to that degree contradict free will and 
selfdetermination he said 
that freedom to decide on ones own conduct and course of action 
is the basis of individual responsibility and a central biblical 
view of humanitys special dignity and distinction from other 
creatures 
nelson director of the institute of religion at the texas 
medical center in houston said in a telephone interview if it 
is conceded that genetics determines almost the total person then 
theres nothing left for morality 
but i dont think it will go that far we do have free will 
its the old question of how much nature or nurture has to do with 
a person 
nevertheless he said the power of the genome to govern human 
characteristics and dispositions is turning up increasingly and 
religious institutions should come to grips with that reality 
i wonder why moral theologians are not pursuing it he said 
he has initiated a threeyear project on genetics religion and 
ethics to spur inquiry into the area 
a first conference of molecular biologists doctors theologians 
and public policy makers has been scheduled for march 30 it is 
cosponsored by the american medical association the national 
council of churches and the world council of churches plus about 
10 denominations 
the whole threat of sociobiology is that we have no free will 
at all that we simply do what our genes tell us to do nelson 
said 
if they are the rule of life he added were going to 
have a lot of questions for traditional norms how much flexibility 
should there be in moral standards if some behavior is 
uncontrollable 
he said evidence is mounting of genetic causes not only of 
physical makeup and a growing list of diseases and susceptibility 
to others but also of predermined patterns of personal 
behavior 
some of these are psychopathic such as schizophrenia and manic 
depression he said but people also may be genetically 
disposed or even genetically determined to alcoholism or 
sexual deviation 
kleptomania compulsive stealing also may be genetically 
caused and perhaps even gambling he said while compulsive 
inclination toward violent and criminal activity is argued among 
geneticists 
all this raises the question of the extent to which good or 
objectional behavior is due to free choice or due to our 
genomes 
some hardline dogmatism in the field maintains that our 
traditional concepts of human free will voluntary choice decision 
making and ethical rectitude are merely illusions he said 
to reject this extreme ideology must not make us blind to 
the range of genetic effects on human behavior he said and 
the search to understand them is as mandatory as it is awesome 
that search goes on in a longtime tension between two opposing 
notions of human life the materialistics viewing it as only 
physical matter and the spiritual seeing its essence as the 
eternal soul or mind 
biblical insights see humanity as combined body and soul a 
psychosomatic whole 
while in the present environment the materialistic theory of 
life seems to prevail it is contradicted by emerging data of 
genetic science itself nelson said adding 
research in molecular biology and biochemistry is rapidly 
discovering heretofore unknown characteristics of the dna molecule 
as the quintessential unit of life and the new knowledge gives 
support and comfort to both the materialists and the idealists 
he said that underlying the chemical interaction making up the 
genetic unit is the source of energy itself and an emerging theory 
in physics that energy and matter are themselves the products of 
an immaterial force 
thus basically genetic science may give signals both to the 
consistent materialists and the idealists that they are right he 
said however there is a plausible truth in the intuition that 
human life is an inseparable admixture of material and spiritual 
dimensions

george bush has reason to smile as he enters 
the second year of his presidency his standing in the polls is at 
phenomenal heights manuel antonio noriega is in us custody and 
communist governments in eastern europe are toppling 
im finishing with a bit of a glow bush acknowledged at 
years end 
but as bush well knows presidents before him have enjoyed the 
glow of favorable circumstances only to suffer the sudden chill of 
events gone sour 
as he celebrated the anniversary of his inauguration bush 
sought to benefit from the political capital gained in recent 
months as he campaigned to win congressional support for a domestic 
agenda topped by his longstanding call for a cut in capital gains 
taxes 
with democrats firmly in control of congress and in a mood to 
challenge the president domestic policy may prove far more 
troublesome for the president than foreign policy 
prospects are considered excellent for conclusion of agreements 
this year on longrange nuclear weapons and on reducing 
conventional military forces in europe 
assessments of bushs first year in office were predictably 
glowing from such partisans as white house chief of staff john 
sununu who said it wasnt an easy year george bush just made it 
seem easy 
but he also earned less partisan praise 
stuart eizenstat the carter administrations domestic policy 
adviser said bush got off to a very rocky start with 
surprising difficulties in filling key positions including a 
losing battle to get john tower confirmed as defense secretary but 
bush wound up having a successful first year and left himself in a 
strong position with congress for 1990 eizenstat said 
democrats in congress were too distracted to make much of any 
early bush missteps as both house speaker jim wright and majority 
leader tony coelho resigned last spring under ethical clouds 
if they hadnt been consuming each other the democrats might 
have treated bush even worse said mitchell daniels president of 
the hudson institute and onetime political strategist for ronald 
reagans white house 
bush after vetoing a 120 increase in the 335 hourly minimum 
wage forced congress instead to swallow the 90cent increase he 
favored 
bush in this age of the extended hand also found 
compromises with congress on the deficit and aid to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua he lost a fight for a lower capital gains tax 
despite passage in the house and majority support in the senate 
but vowed to win that battle this year 
congress hewed closely to the bush administration plan in 
fashioning a multibilliondollar bailout for the savings and loan 
industry they also stuck largely with his blueprint for the war on 
drugs although the lawmakers raised the ante by 1 billion 
bushs crime package got mired in the legislative obstacle 
course and he has yet to earn his stripes as the selfproclaimed 
education president despite an agreement with governors to 
develop performance goals for the nations schools 
democrats who thought bush would be forced to raise taxes have 
been disappointed as he held fast to his readmylips campaign 
pledge 
later this month bush will send congress a fiscal 1991 budget 
certain to meet the grammrudman deficit target of 64 billion and 
unlikely to contain the draconian cuts that earned many reagan 
budgets a dead on arrival stamp on capitol hill 
despite doomsayers predictions that a recession was just around 
the corner the economic expansion has rolled into its eighth year 
with inflation in check and unemployment near a 15year low 
bush had his share of slipups lost battles and controversies 
from the slowfooted response to the oil spill in alaska to the 
tower nomination to the continuing furor over his diplomatic 
overtures to china after the bloody crackdown in june on student 
demonstrators 
three times bush vetoed legislation over abortion financing 
even as some republicans worried that a hardline stance against 
abortion hurt gop gubernatorial candidates in virginia and new 
jersey 
bush accused by senate majority leader george mitchell of 
timidity in the face of major changes sweeping the soviet union 
and east bloc nations went to the nato summit in may with a bold 
proposal for a troop pullout and convention arms reductions across 
europe later he met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at 
the stormtossed malta summit 
he visited poland and hungary in july and by years end had 
signed an aid package of 938 million over three years for the new 
east bloc democracies and draped a medal of freedom around the 
neck of solidaritys lech walesa 
his administration displayed a capacity to learn from mistakes 
or missed opportunities 
if the administration was slow to fathom the gravity of the 
damage from the exxon oil spill in alaskas gulf of valdez it 
moved with dispatch when hurricane hugo devastated charleston 
sc and when an earthquake shattered the san francisco area 
in panama the united states missed an opportunity by not coming 
to the aid of mutineers who sought to overthrow noriega in early 
october but the pentagons dec 20 invasion the largest us 
military operation since the vietnam war was a textbook operation 
bush provided a show of airpower to help philippines president 
corazon aquino put down a mutiny and sent special forces to san 
salvador when rebels took over a hotel with americans trapped 
inside 
he visited 14 countries and the caribbean island of st martin 
in 1989 and is bound for cartagena colombia next month in a 
dramatic gesture of support for colombian president virgilio barco 
and his battle against drug lords 
bush proved himself in sununus phrase the master of the 
small gesture a telephone addict who reached out to world 
leaders on a regular basis that knack came in handy in august when 
a flurry of bush calls helped persuade terrorists in lebanon to 
lift a death threat against american hostage joseph cicippio 
stephen hess a brookings institution scholar said bush had the 
luck to become president in a year when the berlin wall fell and 
old communist regimes were shaken to their roots 
but it was also americas luck that it had a president so 
steeped in foreign affairs he said 
his skills do fit the time hess said what weve got is a 
very cautious man thats exactly what we needed when you cant 
predict whats going to happen in the world with any sense of 
confidence one week ahead the wise course is the prudent course 
the panama invasion also reminded the rest of the world that 
they cant take him for granted said hess 
bushs public approval ratings exceed 70 percent in some polls 
higher than reagan ever achieved his wife barbara proved a big 
hit with the american public and bush attributes some of his own 
popularity to hers 
with the economy still expanding and a feast of miracles 
unfolding in east europe its hard to be unpopular said 
daniels 
but the public can be fickle in its love affair with presidents 
while bush stands high in the ratings now polling experts say 
he does not command the intense loyalty from a sizable cadre of 
supporters that reagan could always count on 
he hasnt built intensive support that may come back to haunt 
him said larry j sabato a political scientist at the 
university of virginia

doru tigau a philosophy professor sat in 
a chair occupied until a few weeks ago by a niece of nicolae 
ceausescu he smoked an endless chain of cigarettes and talked 
about trying to run romanias revolution in an outofthe way place 
like iasi 
for the time being this is a nightmare he said there is 
a leadership in bucharest that isnt giving us instructions but 
giving us a general line 
but he has ideas 
everyone should take as much land as he and his family can 
work without hiring someone else to work for him he said a 
hardworking man can have everything but a lazy man has nothing or 
changes his job 
tigau 43 is the president of the 24member local branch of the 
national salvation front which has taken over communist party 
headquarters in iasi a city of 300000 people on the soviet border 
in his hands and in the hands of other local leaders like him 
may rest romanias future as a democracy 
after the euphoria of victory nutsandbolts administrative 
problems face inexperienced local leaders like tigau who are trying 
to turn an uprising against the leadership into a revolution in 
every aspect of society 
the revolution has no money but bills still must be paid 
there is no personal security but bands of ceausescus secret 
police have disappeared nervous soldiers keeping the peace 
mistakenly have threatened leaders of the revolution as well 
more than 200 ceausescu loyalists must be replaced in top 
government jobs in the region 
the revolt that led to nicolae ceausescus execution on 
christmas day went off quietly in iasi no bullet holes pock the 
walls of buildings and no memorials mark the places as they do in 
the capital bucharest where people fell to the gunfire of 
ceausescus personal guard 
now tigau is the leader of iasi presiding from the long 
paneled office where the local communist party leader ceausescus 
niece maria ghitulica once ran things 
up from his desk and pacing the floor to stay awake and still 
smoking tigau consulted with subordinates on selecting a new 
official to take responsibility for cultural affairs and he 
expounded on the need to put land back in the hands of peasants 
tigau said he never actively opposed the ceausescu leadership 
but expressed his opposition in trying to show his students the 
difference between reality and what the dictator preached 
across the border in soviet moldavia deputy premier mikhail s 
platon said in an interview that contacts with the new local 
leaders of iasi showed them to be enthusiastic but inexperienced 
they are young people he said 
one of the problems in iasi is that the revolution is without 
money the hundreds of volunteers racing busily around in the 
threestory party headquarters are not getting paid for it nor 
does the local national salvation front have any way of getting 
money 
while willing to help foreign visitors make longdistance 
telephone calls tigaus team insisted that the calls be paid for 
directly to the telephone exchange in local currency the lei so 
while an operator traveled from the telephone office to collect the 
money and then put through the call travelers dollars were taken 
to the local bank 
there as under the repressive ceausescu regime the serial 
numbers of the bills were registered before the bank handed over 
the official exchange of romanian currency 
but lodging in the main tourist hotel usually the equivalent in 
leis of about 30 a night was free 
you must not pay said a desk clerk named irina 
why not 
thats just the new rule 
after the revolution the supply of food improved in iasi 
georgetta agape a young sales clerk at a meat counter in an 
iasi food store said she no longer had to experience the shame of 
asking to see peoples identifications before she could sell them 
rationed meat 
for the first time in many years we had such delicacies as 
salami ham and pork she said but the store was sold out of 
them by nightfall 
even the unofficial price of kent cigarettes for years 
romanias unofficial black currency for the procurement of 
goods in great demand dropped dramatically from about 200 lei a 
pack 2270 at the stillprevailing official rate of exchange 
as kents went on sale in regular stores several people said 
the old communist party central committee headquarters is now 
guarded by soldiers with automatic weapons 
tigau recalled that he and the army captain in charge of 
security at the revolutionary headquarters were detained as they 
walked nearby at 430 one morning by anxious young soldiers manning 
an armored personnel carrier 
guns were taken away from the two and tigau recalled the young 
soldier asking the officer in charge what do we do now shoot 
them instead they were taken to the nearby palace of culture 
where cooler heads checked their identities and let them go 
another time a woman seeking a meeting with tigau in his office 
was found to be carrying a knife 
civilians unaccustomed to weapons that had been strictly 
controlled carried guns in the first days of the uprising adding 
to the uncertainty and tension 
mihai avadanei a teacher of english and a translator said in 
amazement im 48 years old and i was carrying a gun and i was 
ready to use it 
but in contrast to the heavy cordons of soldiers and 
paratroopers around leaders in the capital no security is provided 
for the new local leaders of the revolution or their families in 
iasi 
that compounds worries about the 200 members of ceausescus 
securitate secret police who were stationed in iasi and who local 
officials say disappeared after the revolt the army confiscated 
their weapons but many people believe that securitate had secret 
stocks hidden elsewhere 
the central committees stack of books by and about ceausescu 
are being gathered for disposal 
when tigau opened cabinets and the safe of mrs ghitulica 
ceausescus niece he said he found packages of foreignmade hose 
and womens underwear her communist party card 62000 lei in 
checks and a telegram from an unknown source appealing to iasi to 
join the revolt against ceausescu 
beyond the daytoday problems that take so much of his time 
tigau reserves his revolutionary passion for changing the countrys 
agricultural system and bringing better qualified people into the 
leadership 
the only criterion will be the value of the man his 
competence he said it doesnt matter if he agrees with us or 
not 
we dont want to install their terror the terror of the 
socalled proletarian revolution he said this is the 
revolution of intellectual peaceful people

campeau corps decision to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection from creditors for its two us retailing subsidiaries 
on monday means the debtswamped businesses can operate and many 
consumers may never notice a change 
none of the 258 stores operated by federated department stores 
inc and allied stores corp is expected to close although some may 
be sold as part of any future restructuring which will have to be 
approved by a bankruptcy judge under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act companies are shielded from creditors while they 
remain in business and attempt to reorganize their finances so all 
debts eventually can be repaid many companies emerge from chapter 
11 as smaller but financially sound businesses 
in campeaus case the chapter 11 filings immediate result 
would be to keep stores open and supplied many businesses had been 
reluctant to continue shipping merchandise to campeau stores 
because they werent sure theyd be paid but the filing will 
establish a timetable for payment that could help reassure these 
suppliers 
it was unclear how the filing may affect campeaus 110000 
employees in the united states some of whom presumably could be 
laid off in any bankruptcy restructuring 
immediately however the companys stores have indicated that 
employees would continue to receive pay and benefits and business 
would continue as usual 
uncertainty over whether campeau would be able to repay the 8 
billion in debts it has acquired through takeovers of federated and 
allied was the main reason the parent company sought bankruptcy 
court refuge for its us units

here is a list of events chronicling campeau corps 
debtfinanced expansion into a us retailing giant and its rapid 
descent into a financial crisis which forced the canadian company 
to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for its american 
department store chains on monday 
dec 31 1986 campeau buys allied stores corp for 34 
billion marking the real estate development companys first major 
foray into the american retailing industry 
jan 5 1987 documents filed with the securities and exchange 
commission show campeau plans to sell 16 allied divisions and cut 
its holdings of nearly 700 stores by more than half in order to pay 
11 billion in bank loans used to finance the takeover

joskes chain and fourstore cainsloan chain to dillard department 
stores inc for 255 million

teller chain for 101 million to hooker corp ltd one of 
australias largest and oldest conglomerates that would later

jan 25 1988 campeau still digesting its takeover of allied 
makes a 42 billion bid for federated department stores inc but 
the nations fifthlargest retailing company vows to resist

countersteps campeau and macy maneuver to win control of federated 
in a bidding war that raises the price by nearly 25 billion above 
campeaus original offer 
april 1 1988 campeau wins federated in a 66 billion 
compromise deal arranged in a threehour meeting between chairman 
robert campeau and macy chairman edward finkelstein under the

nov 1 1988 uncertainty over the outlook for junkbond

analysts as a sign that campeau may have taken excessive risks in 
relying heavily on debt to expand 
nov 29 1988 campeau sells allieds 91store ann taylor 
specialty clothing chain for 430 million to an investor group that 
includes the chains management and merrill lynch capital markets

financial executive quit over differences with the chairman over 
how to approach the companys growing financial problems it is the 
latest of many departures that undermine the companys senior

campeau corp voting stock after another company controlled by

the chapter 11 petition monday by campeau corps department 
store operations in the united states marked the biggest bankruptcy 
court filing ever for a retailer 
here is a brief look at campeau corp what happened and who is 
immediately affected 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
once a construction and real estate development company 
torontobased campeau corp became primarily known for acquiring 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp in the 
united states where founder robert campeau gambled he could make 
an immense fortune the chains operate 258 stores throughout the 
country ranging from bloomingdales in the east to lazarus in the 
midwest and south to the bon marche in the west the immense debt 
the companies incurred in the buyout by campeau combined with 
disappointing retail sales crimped their ability to meet interest 
payments and merchandise bills 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
bank creditors led by citibank pressured campeau last month to 
show it could pay 234 billion in loans a fraction of its total 
obligations suppliers of credit and merchandise to campeau stores 
began to withhold delivery fearing they wouldnt get paid some 
employees and campeau stores reported local banks wouldnt cash 
their paychecks many observers speculated that bankruptcy court 
was the most logical strategy for allowing the retailing operations 
to remain open while the parent companies worked out a way to pay 
their debts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law campeaus 
retailing units will get an immediate reprieve from creditor bills 
while a reorganization plan is devised to satisfy debts suppliers 
likely will resume or continue shipments confident they will be 
paid federated and allied said the stores will continue to operate 
as normal employees will still get pay and benefits and customer 
services credit card sales merchandise returns gift 
certificates for example would continue as normal a 
reorganization plan which might include the sale of some stores 
and all other major business moves must be approved by a bankruptcy 
judge

merrill lynch amp co plans to slash about 3000 
jobs in 1990 including about 1000 layoffs in another sign of 
hard times on wall street 
the cuts should reduce the total work force at the nations 
largest brokerage to about 36800 compared with 40500 at the end 
of 1989 and a peak of 47000 shortly before the october 1987 stock 
market crash 
what weve seen is just a continuation of the staff reductions 
all over wall street said john keefe a securities industry 
analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc merrill is a big place 
in terms of numbers they have the biggest potential for cuts 
merrill spokesman fred yager said monday that the reductions 
would be spread throughout the year and occur through layoffs 
attrition and selling off businesses the firm announced plans for 
acrosstheboard trimming in november 
yager said the firm had no target for the size reductions but a 
merrill official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
reductions would total about 3000 including as many as 1000 
layoffs 
we are going through a selective process and there will be 
selective layoffs as we go along yager said 
merrill reduced about 700 positions earlier this month by 
selling its canadian retail brokerage operation and eliminated 300 
more jobs through cuts in its broadcort capital corp 
accountclearing business 
since november merrill also has abandoned the european 
commercial paper business eliminated one equity division at its 
new york headquarters and reduced trading of british stocks 
merrill has slashed about 40 out of 600 jobs in its equities 
trading area and 10 of 130 in equities research this month 
brokerage firms across wall street have suffered because of 
overcapacity stemming from precrash days and too little business 
more than 23000 jobs have been cut on wall street in a 
retrenchment since the crash 
despite strong stock and bond markets last year the industry 
has been in a downturn in part because of an exodus by individual 
investors and a decline in businesses such as investment banking 
merrill is one of the powerhouses on the street keefe said 
they have just about every business there and business is in a 
slowdown generally 
for the first nine months of 1989 merrill earnings fell 208 
percent to 148 million compared with 187 million in the same 
1988 period the firm has not yet released its fourthquarter 
results 
shearson lehman hutton inc the no 2 brokerage said monday it 
expects to report a fourthquarter profit of 1 million to 5 
million compared with a 13 million loss in 1988 
before taxes though the firm said it would lose 7 million to 
13 million down from 17 million a year ago shearson said 
fourthquarter expenses also would include about 7 million in 
severance payments from previously announced staff reductions 
for the full year shearson said it expects net income of 107 
million to 111 million up from 96 million in 1988 
shearson in december announced a 900 million recapitalization 
plan to preserve its credit rating and reduce american express 
cos ownership to below 50 percent the firm also began laying off 
800 workers reshuffled its senior management and slashed 
stockbroker commissions

specialty chains will have an edge over mass 
merchandisers as the american retail industry adapts to changing 
consumer needs in the 1990s executives and economists say 
the days are numbered for giant retailers trying to be all 
things to all people stores without a sharp focus will lose 
customers while competitors making clear pitches to niches will 
gobble up market share according to views presented monday at the 
national retail merchants associations 79th annual convention 
and on a day when debtchoked campeau corp announced it was 
sheltering its us retailers in bankruptcy court industry 
executives predicted a bleak future for heavily leveraged store 
groups 
allied stores corp and federated department stores inc 
operators of many prominent us department stores were placed 
under court protection from creditors it was the largest filing 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code ever made by a us 
retailer 
chains run by allied and federated accounting for nearly 260 
department stores will stay in business while a reorganization 
plan is plotted campeau took on a crushing debt burden when it 
bought federated for 66 billion in 1988 and allied for 34 
billion in 1986 
william r howell chairman and chief executive officer of jc 
penney co inc said it will become increasingly difficult for 
debtladen retailers with weak balance sheets to remain independent 
or even survive 
well continue to see a shakeout process in the years 
ahead he said at the convention held in a new york hotel the 
retail business has been hurt by overpriced mergers and by the 
resultant overleveraging of companies 
thomas e swanstrom chief economist of sears roebuck and co 
said some of the problems caused by the campeau crisis should 
subside in a few months 
campeaus desperation for cash late last year forced its stores 
to slash prices to attract customers and boost sales competing 
stores had to follow suit which pinched profits 
retailers face other challenges to profitability partly due to 
weak consumer spending forecasters agreed the economy will remain 
sluggish but stay out of a recession 
robert t parry president and chief executive officer of the 
federal reserve bank of san francisco predicted the gross national 
product after adjustment for inflation will rise only about 2 
percent in 1990 
norman robertson chief economist for mellon bank in pittsburgh 
said american consumers will channel more of their income into 
savings for retailers its going to be a tough year requiring 
an adjustment after the prolonged economic strength during the 
1980s 
one bright spot is that general merchandise inflation has been 
receding according to swanstrom of chicagobased sears the 
nations biggest retailer 
he said sales of general merchandise apparel furniture and 
appliances should grow by about 6 percent this year the same as in 
1989 but inflation will be lower so real sales growth will be 
greater this year he predicted 
convention speakers said retailers who want to thrive in the 
90s when customers will prefer to devote less time to shopping 
must take steps to set themselves apart 
in a timeshort environment consumers will be more attracted 
to stores that have a clear identity said rosalind wells chief 
economist of the retail association 
she said retailers can use a range of characteristics to achieve 
the goal including price service quality convenience fashion 
assortment and inventory depth 
sprawling general merchandise chains that dont tailor their 
strategy to appeal to particular population segments could suffer 
today it is accepted that the general merchandiser is a 
dinosaur said howell of dallasbased penney the 90s will 
confirm that the future belongs to retailers who choose a niche 
and then focus on demographic and lifestyle trends within that 
niche to keep up with the consumer

campeau corps department stores placed under bankruptcy court 
protection are trying to carry on as if nothing happened and 
customers are not likely to notice any immediate disruption in 
business 
we are open we are open normal hours we have a lot of 
merchandise to sell chairman mark cohen of cincinnatibased 
lazarus said after the bankruptcy filing monday 
executives at the other eight chains owned by heavily indebted 
campeau also sought to reassure customers that they were open for 
business as usual and employees were told their jobs werent in 
jeopardy 
vendors said they would continue to ship merchandise to the 258 
department stores operated by allied stores corp and federated 
department stores inc campeaus biggest us retail subsidiaries 
campeau saddled with heavy debts from trying to build a 
coasttocoast retail empire filed for protection from creditors 
on behalf of allied and federated under chapter 11 of the us 
bankruptcy code the filing allows the retailers to remain in 
business while they reorganize 
store officials tried to put the filing in as positive a light 
as possible by placing the chains financial fate in the hands of 
a bankruptcy court judge in cincinnati where allied and federated 
are based the stores could operate free from debt worries the 
officials said 
in addition to lazarus campeaus chains include abraham amp 
straus bloomingdales the bon marche burdines maas brothers 
jordan marsh and richsgoldsmiths 
the bloomingdales flagship store in new york city opened 10 
minutes late because employees were still listening over intercoms 
to a statement from chairman marvin s traub and president jeffrey 
sherman 
chapter 11 signifies a new beginning and is certainly the best 
alternative for us at bloomingdales the statement said in part 
it provides us with a fresh start and enables us to go forward 
similar statements were issued elsewhere 
at jordan marsh in boston richard van pelt chairman and chief 
executive officer and sam simmons president and chief operating 
officer said all stores would remain open merchandise shipments 
would continue and all employees would continue to be paid and 
receive benefits 
store policies such as credit gift certificates billing 
adjustments merchandise returns and service contracts also would 
continue the executives said 
normalcy also was the operative word at the bon marche based in 
seattle john buller vice president of sales and marketing said 
the chain has been doing well and sales were unaffected monday by 
the filing in fact business has been very good were having a 
heck of a january 
cohen of lazarus said he is confident the store group has a 
bright future he said all customer services will be continued 
employees will be paid on schedule and suppliers will be paid under 
the bankruptcy courts supervision 
meanwhile ralphs grocery co a separate subsidiary of campeau 
called a news conference to say the southern california supermarket 
chain was in fine financial shape and was not included in the 
alliedfederated filing 
clothing and other manufacturers who supply allied and federated 
stores seemed comforted by the filing several who had previously 
suspended merchandise shipments said they would start supplying the 
stores again 
we intend to commence shipments of our products as soon as the 
bankruptcy courts allow us to do so thereby averting any 
disruption in delivery of our merchandise to these stores said 
howard cooley president of jockey international an underwear 
maker 
shoppers expressed surprise and sadness that some of their 
favorite stores were having to cope with severe financial problems 
its a sad move said maria perez a customer at miamibased 
burdines she said that with the stores in bankruptcy proceedings 
she wasnt sure whether she would continue shopping there 
ive been seeing it coming she said the clothes now are 
not as good quality as a couple of years ago 
other shoppers at miamis international mall said they would 
remain loyal to burdines its a good store with good 
merchandise and the workers are always helpful i hope they stay 
open and have business the same way said sixto hernandez of 
miami 
for the most part customers took a practical approach on the 
main floor of richs flagship store in downtown atlanta evelyn 
oglesby of stone mountain ga said she hoped the store would 
survive the financial problems of its parent company 
but if it didnt mrs oglesby said im hoping they have a 
big sale and i hope i wont have to pay off my credit card

the leaders of us memories said the 
planned computer chipmaking consortium failed because the 
electronics industry lacks a longterm strategy to compete with 
japan 
we had an opportunity as a nation and an industry to send a 
message and we missed it said sanford l kane president of the 
nowdefunct joint venture 
us memories formed six months ago with the hope of expanding 
americas small output of dynamic random access memory chips or 
drams announced monday it was dissolving because of inadequate 
financial support from computer companies 
japanese companies now supply about 75 percent of the market 
while us manufacturers have less than 10 percent us memories 
hoped to take 25 percent of the us market 
the consortium was born at a time when short supplies had driven 
up the price of drams which store data in a wide range of 
electronic products and are often compared to crude oil in their 
importance to industry 
since then chip supplies have increased and prices have 
dropped in part because several companies including samsung of 
south korea have started production analysts say 
at a meeting in dallas on wednesday most of us memories 
original seven investors and four potential backers were unwilling 
to put up enough money to enable the consortium to build a 1 
billion plant kane told a news conference the companies also 
would not promise to buy enough of its 4megabit drams he said 
us companies apparently no longer think they have a problem 
with chip supplies kane said 
what happens today does not bode well for an industry that has 
made a technical decision rather than a tactical one kane said 
wilfred corrigan us memories chairman said the issue for 
american companies wasnt simply one of adequate supply but more a 
matter of control over it he gave grudging praise to japans 
coaching and quarterbacking 
you look at a us laptop computer today and the display 
comes from japan the memory comes from japan he said the 
computer has simply become the gift box in which japanese products 
get mailed to the user 
one analyst predicted the collapse of the consortium would have 
no immediate effect 
the bottom line is today theres a good supply of drams and 
the prices are low and going lower said fred jones of dataquest 
in san jose 
officials in states that vied for the planned us memories 
plant and industry representatives were disappointed by the 
announcement 
it is truly a shame that the facility plans could not go 
forward said arizona gov rose mofford in a statement phoenix 
colorado springs colo austin texas and middletown ny were 
the four sites us memories was considering for its plant 
the consortiums original investors were international business 
machines corp digital equipment corp hewlettpackard co intel 
corp advanced micro devices inc national semiconductor corp 
and lsi logic 
although us companies in several industries have cooperated in 
recent years on joint research projects us memories was planned 
as the first consortium to manufacture products 
us memories originally planned to pay for the plant with 500 
million in equity financing from chip makers and users and 500 
million in debt with fundraising expected to be completed last 
year 
the consortium later decided it would need only 400 million in

bankruptcy court filings released today show 
campeau corps two department store divisions owe billions of 
dollars to a range of unsecured creditors mostly banks and wall 
street firms that helped finance the retailing giants expansion 
the filings in the largest bankruptcy proceeding in retailing 
history showed total assets of 91 billion and liabilities of 77 
billion for the units of the canadian company 
campeau placed them under federal bankruptcy court supervision 
monday so they could reorganize to pay their debts under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy act 
in another development campeaus us subsidiary appointed g 
william miller former federal reserve board chairman and treasury 
secretary as its chairman and chief executive officer 
the company also announced that it would change its name from 
campeau corp us inc to federated stores inc 
the us subsidiary of torontobased campeau operates such 
wellknown department stores as bloomingdales richs and lazarus 
the filing allows the stores to continue operating while the 
company reorganizes 
in papers filed in us bankruptcy court in cincinnati 
federated department stores inc listed assets of 62 billion and 
liabilities of 53 billion allied stores corp listed assets of 
29 billion and liabilities of 24 billion 
federated said its largest unsecured creditor is first boston 
corp which holds 428 million in bonds allied listed campeau 
corp as its largest unsecured creditor with 100 million in bonds 
outstanding 
the filing monday was the largest under chapter 11 by an 
american retailer affecting about 100000 employees and 258 stores 
in the united states and the second largest ever by a 
nonfinancial company after texaco inc which sought court 
protection in april 1987 
miller currently chairman of g william miller amp co inc a 
washingtonbased merchant banking firm has served on the boards of 
campeau federated and allied since 1987 
he originally joined federateds board in 1976 but resigned two 
years later when he became the fed chairman from 1979 to 1981 
miller served as treasury secretary under president carter 
miller was reelected to the federated board in 1981 and after 
campeau bought the retailing company he joined the boards of 
campeau and allied 
campeau also announced other changes regarding senior management 
at its us operations including the resignation of the chairman 
of its retailers ronald w tysoe currently president of both 
campeau corp and campeau us will continue as president of the 
newly renamed federated holding company but he will phase out his 
responsibilities at the canadian parent 
john w burden iii chairman and chief executive officer of 
federated and allied has quit effective jan 31 to pursue other 
interests campeau said the company said it expects to name a 
successor soon to run the retailing operations 
james m zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating 
officer of federated and allied the management teams at all 
department store chains will continue in place 
the management at ralphs grocery co a southern california 
supermarket chain owned by campeau that was not part of the 
bankruptcy court filing will not be changed campeau said 
miller 64 steps into a job created when campeau last week 
split its us operations from the parent company giving them 
operating independence 
the company is now positioned with a strong and experienced 
management team at all levels to manage what has always been a 
highly successful group of american retail businesses with a new 
name that reflects our retailing orientation he said in a news 
release 
tysoe said he has been asked by miller to focus full time on 
restructuring the retailers 
the decision to seek court protection was made late sunday by 
the boards of campeau and the two divisions and reflected campeaus 
inability to pay off 8 billion in debt much of it resulting from 
the 34 billion acquisition of allied in 1986 and the 66 billion 
purchase of federated in 1988 
the decision to seek chapter 11 relief was based on a 
conclusion that action was required at this time in order to 
preserve the operations strength and assets of the two department 
store companies while the corporate debt is restructured campeau 
said in a statement monday 
under chapter 11 the companies get a reprieve from creditors 
and can continue operating while reorganizing their finances but 
all decisions regarding the companies must be approved by a 
bankruptcy judge 
federateds stores include abraham and straus and bloomingdales 
of new york burdines of miami lazarus of cincinnati and richs 
of atlanta allieds stores include the bon marche of seattle 
jordan marsh of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of 
paramus nj

junk bond prices fell further today in reaction 
to the bankruptcy court filing by two campeau corp divisions and 
early declines in the stock and government bond markets 
prices of highyield debt securities were quoted down about rsqb 
point to point on average or about 375 to 5 per 1000 in 
face value 
junk bonds fell slightly monday after the allied stores corp 
and federated department stores inc sought bankruptcy court 
protection but traders said reaction was muted because of slow 
trading on the martin luther king jr holiday and because the 
filing was expected 
when the stock market and government bond markets opened sharply 
lower today junk bonds followed suit traders said 
a lot of the betterquality names have been quoted down 
said joan greenberg manager of the highyield group at dean witter 
reynolds inc it wasnt very surprising considering the 
government securities market and the stock market opened down 
she said todays early declines were not entirely a reaction to 
campeau but added whats scary now is not that campeau filed but 
the publicizing of how much unsecured debt is outstanding the 
campeau story is definitely right up front in everybodys minds 
traders said most highyield issues fell about point to 
point monday or 250 to 5 for every 1000 in face value of the 
bond 
widely held 1371 percent rjr holdings capital corp convertible 
bonds due in 2009 were down about point at 90 after falling 
about point on monday rjr 1371 percent debentures of 2007 were 
at 78 down point 
the two units of torontobased campeau operate 258 stores in the 
united states including bloomingdales jordan marsh abraham amp 
straus lazarus and sterns 
allieds 105 percent bonds were quoted steady with monday at 
about 42 while its 115 percent bonds were quoted in a wide range 
on average near mondays close at 11 federateds 16 percent bonds 
due 2000 were down about point to 11 
bonds of ralphs grocery co a campeauowned southern california 
chain held steady this morning at 95 after falling about 3 points 
monday ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy filing but 
traders said there is concern bondholders may seek to claim they 
were defrauded because of campeaus troubles 
among other notable issues rh macy amp co 14 percent bonds 
due 1998 were quoted at 94 down point 
highyield bonds called junk because they are rated below 
investment grade also fell sharply on friday in tandem with a 
sharp drop in the stock market mondays decline was the junk 
markets fourth straight 
the 210 billion highyield bond market has slumped since 
campeaus surprise disclosure of liquidity problems last september 
prices have not recovered entirely and new issues of junk bonds 
have been squelched because of the selloff 
for the 1989 fourth quarter analysts said highyield bonds 
showed a total return of negative 4 percent 
moodys investors service inc said it lowered the ratings on 
all allied and federated subordinated debt because of the filing 
moodys said about 22 billion in federated and 16 billion in 
allied debt securities were affected it said the companies were in 
default on a 234 billion bank loan 
due to the bankruptcy filing the allied and federated bonds 
were trading flat that is without accrued interest junk 
bonds normally pay interest twice a year in flat trading sellers 
do not receive interest accrued from the last payment and buyers do 
not have to pay it

business sales and inventories both rose in 
november the government said tuesday but economists noted that 
slower sales the following month could worsen the december 
situation 
the commerce department said inventories rose 05 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted 7968 billion in november after rising 03 
percent a month earlier the november figure was slightly higher 
than the 04 percent increase originally reported 
business sales were up 07 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
5236 billion after falling a revised 05 percent in october 
that revision compared with the initially reported 07 percent drop 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth 
and could result in production cutbacks and loss of jobs as 
businesses try to reduce the accumulation of goods on shelves and 
backlots such activity is taking place in the auto industry for 
example as carmakers try to shrink bloated inventories with 
production cuts and layoffs 
retail sales were relatively modest in december said 
evelina tainer senior domestic economist for the first national 
bank of chicago autos were still weak so theres a potential 
for the inventoriestosales ratio number to worsen 
the november business activity caused the ratio of inventories 
to sales to decline slightly to 152 meaning it would take 152 
months to exhaust inventories at the november pace the ratio was 
153 in october 
ms tainer did not consider the ratio to be alarming saying it 
was relatively low compared to 10 years ago 
producers used to keep more inventories and i think they have 
become leaner she said so were not in the same problem area 
that we would have been several years ago 
ms tainer said the inventory problems that do exist are 
concentrated in certain areas such as automobiles 
chrysler co ford motor co and general motors corp all have 
announced temporary layoffs to reduce their vehicle inventories 
mazda motor corp of japan also is trimming production at its us 
plant this month 
retail inventories rose 06 percent in november while sales 
increased 05 percent the commerce department reported last week 
that retail sales gained only 02 percent in december 
inventories at the manufacturing level which represent about 45 
percent of the total rose 03 percent manufacturing sales 
increased 05 percent 
wholesalers inventories advanced 05 percent while their sales 
jumped 12 percent 
overall inventories were 68 percent above those of a year ago 
while sales were up 44 percent

east germanys economics minister on 
tuesday conceded two more exceptions to jointventure regulations 
that will allow numerous west german firms to hold majority shares 
economics minister christa luft told reporters after her talks 
with west german counterpart helmut haussmann that small and 
mediumsized companies as well as those large firms with superb 
knowhow will be allowed to become majority owners 
the east german parliament approved draft regulations on friday 
that established 49 percent as the upper limit for foreign 
ownership of enterprises in east germany 
east germans fear that allowing foreign companies especially 
wealthy and influential west german industrial giants to hold 
majority ownership could lead to a buyout of the economically 
troubled state struggling toward democracy 
but west german firms have rejected the 49 percent limit as too 
restrictive and insufficient to attract the major infusions of 
capital east germany needs to turn around its stagnant economy 
ms luft said east germany plans to retain the 49 percent 
ceiling in principle but that exceptions will be made 
east german openness to exceptions for firms with special 
technical knowhow appears to open a wide door for west germanys 
numerous aerospace computer chemical and engineering firms that 
are seeking to establish themselves in the reformminded nation 
next door 
hundreds of small familyrun companies have expressed interest 
in setting up intergerman ventures but only on condition that 
they own controlling interest in the companies 
an influential delegation of west german industrialists traveled 
to east berlin over the weekend for talks with ms luft communist 
premier hans modrow and other officials and political leaders for 
talks on how to boost business ties 
edzard reuter chairman of the daimlerbenz conglomerate that is 
west germanys largest company and one of the biggest defense and 
technology firms in the world told reporters after the visit that 
the 49 percent limit was businesswise and psychologically wrong 
ms luft and haussmann said they made good progress in closing 
gaps between east german and west german economic cooperation 
during their talks in bonn 
they announced that a joint committee had been established to 
work out the details of an investment protection agreement

american telephone amp telegraph co has 
traced a computer software failure that blocked millions of 
longdistance calls on monday to a backup system in new york a top 
company official said today 
chairman robert e allen also said atampt plans to offer a 
discount day for businesses who may have lost money because 
customers were unable to do business by telephone 
allen made the comments at a latemorning news conference at the 
companys network operations center in bedminster nj 
the company said mondays outage which blocked longdistance 
calls nationwide for about nine hours was its most widespread 
ever but the martin luther king day holiday prevented the impact 
from being worse 
atampt said it discovered the problem in midafternoon and 
corrected it shortly before midnight well before the start of the 
regular business schedule today 
the company said the system was operating normally today as 
business hours began although atampt did not know exactly what went 
wrong monday 
were seeing traffic starting to build up and the network is 
operating flawlessly spokeswoman daisy ottmann said at 
midmorning 
at the news conference allen said the company did not believe 
the problem was rooted in a computer virus but workers were still 
investigating that possibility 
it does not act like a computer bug allen said 
he said the proposed special discount calling day required 
approval from the federal communications commission 
he said atampt had no liability insurance for regular 
longdistance phone lines but would be covered for any damages 
resulting from loss of business on its tollfree 800 system 
ms ottmann said the company had recently installed new software 
in its system and that the trouble was somewhere within the 
software atampt removed the new software late monday and with it 
the problems that plagued the longdistance network 
the removal of the new software didnt take away any 
processing power of the network ms ottmann said 
about half the longdistance callers on the atampt network got a 
busy signal or a recording saying all circuits were busy the 
company said 
arizona telemarketing inc of phoenix which places 4000 to 
9000 calls a day gave its 40 employees an unexpected holiday in 
the afternoon 
we had to close the place down said miriam benson company 
president 
janice falwin a montclair nj graphics designer who relies 
on her fax machine to present projects to clients in los angeles 
new york and boston said the outage caused her to miss a deadline 
and that could cost her 1000 
deadlines are my life if i miss a deadline i dont eat the 
telephone is like a lifeline to me said falwin who works out of 
her house 
on an average business day 80 million calls go through the atampt 
system said sally sherwood another atampt spokeswoman she said she 
did not know how many calls were attempted monday or how many 
actually went through 
the problem apparently began in one of the companys electronic 
switching centers which transfer calls from one line of the 
longdistance network to another ms ottmann said it then spread 
to the other 100 or so switching centers she said 
its like striking the church bell in a steeple and all the 
other bells resonate this is a vibrating or resonating problem 
she said 
atampt controls about 70 percent of the longdistance market its 
major competitors mci communications corp and us sprint reported 
no problems 
atampt customers are able to use the mci and sprint systems by 
dialing special access codes however atampt operators were 
forbidden even when asked to give out this information for 
competitive reasons ms sherwood said 
ms sherwood said experts from bell laboratories atampts 
research arm assisted in fixing the problem at the companys 
network operations center in bedminster nj the hub of its phone 
system 
certainly intense would an accurate description of the 
activity she said 
a technician at the operations center who spoke on condition of 
anonymity described the scene to the new york times as chaotic 
and almost out of control as engineers worked on the problem 
past problems have been limited to a certain region 
atampt began installing the electronic callswitching gear in 
1987 ms sherwood said 
nothing like this has happened before she said 
the company said the problem affected all its phone lines 
including tollfree 800 numbers and overseas calls except for 
private lines that companies lease between their offices or plants 
some calls were deliberately blocked by atampt to enable it to 
isolate the problem it said 
hotel and airline reservations offices were among hard hit 
businesses 
cindy sheffield phone systems manager for the marriott hotels 
reservation office in omaha neb said the problem was 
devastating because her office wasnt receiving calls from 
customers the office received only 10 percent of its normal call 
volume she said 
american airlines spokeswoman mary oneill in fort worth texas 
said the carrier was experiencing about twothirds fewer calls than 
normal on its reservation lines 
trans midamerica an omahabased marketing company that sells 
temporary motor vehicle licenses couldnt make any long distance 
or 800number calls said florence waymire a company vice

general electric co said tuesday a 
partnership it is organizing will spend about 2 billion during the 
next five years to develop a cleaner more fuelefficient and 
quieter longrange engine for commercial jetliners 
the company says the ge90 designed for longrange widebody 
jets would cost 10 million per unit according to brian h rowe 
senior vice president of ges aircraft engines division based in 
this cincinnati suburb 
the company envisions a potential 50 billion worldwide market 
for the engine 
rowe said the engine could reduce fuel consumption by about 10 
percent he estimated a widebody jetliner using two of the engines 
could save about 400000 gallons of fuel a year 
general electric hopes the ge90 would reduce emissions by 30 
percent from longrange engines now used rowe said 
he also said the engine would be designed to meet more stringent 
federal aviation administration noisereduction standards 
rowe acknowledged that ges major competitors the pratt amp 
whitney division of united technologies corp and britains rolls 
royce are developing rival engines rowe said he hopes ge can 
land at least 30 percent of the global market with the ge90 
the ge90 is to be designed for boeings planned 767x twinengine 
widebody jet being marketed but not yet in commercial service ge 
also is looking for other markets and is talking with jet makers 
mcdonnell douglas and the french producer airbus industrie rowe 
said at a news conference 
our main emphasis at this time is to get the engine launched 
on the 767x rowe said but if somebody else comes along with a 
new application well be very happy 
the french manufacturer snecma a 5050 partner with general 
electric during the past decade in the cfm international joint 
enginemaking venture is expected to be a 25 percent partner in 
the ge90 project rowe said 
the engines would be produced in france and the united states 
parisbased snecma under its current cfm international operation 
with ge produces some cfm engines at a plant in villaroche 
france other cfm engines are made at ges evendale plant 
general electric also hopes mtu a manufacturer based in munich 
will be a partner that is subject to approval by mtus board of 
directors rowe said 
rowe said ge expects that swedish automaker volvo and the 
italian automaker fiat will produce parts for the ge90 both 
companies have produced parts for other ge engines 
other partners may enter the project as well ge officials said 
some of the ge90 parts are likely to be produced at ges plant 
in lynn mass rowe said 
he said the company will spend the next six months lining up its 
partners and getting the research program established developing 
and testing the engine could take five years 
ge hopes to obtain commercial certification of the engine in may 
1994 and enter it in commercial service in 1995 
the engine will provide 75000 to 95000 pounds of thrust ges 
current cf6 engine used in longrange flight develops power of 
52500 to 75000 pounds of thrust ge spokesman dwight weber said

the big three automakers got off to an upbeat 
start for 1990 selling 264 percent more usbuilt cars and light 
trucks in early january than in the same period last year the 
companies said tuesday 
truck sales rose 255 percent for general motors corp chrysler 
corp and ford motor co and car sales increased by 271 percent 
the big three said they sold cars and light trucks at a daily 
rate of 30844 during the jan 110 period this year compared with 
a rate of 24393 during the same time last year 
chryslers car sales rose 144 percent in early january from the 
same period last year while truck sales jumped 437 percent from 
last years early january figures 
automotive industry analysts said chryslers gain in the truck 
market this period shows the automakers incentive program on 
minivans has boosted consumer interest in the vehicles 
one reason for the higher sales overall was unusually low sales 
in january 1989 which followed a december 1988 buying rush 
consumers hoping to take advantage of incentive packages that 
expired at the end of 1988 boosted december sales and that 
contributed to the january 1989 slump 
gms car sales increased 404 percent in early january and truck 
sales rose 284 percent over 1989s first reporting period 
ford said its sales rose 154 percent for cars and 109 percent 
for trucks in early january compared with same period last year

intel corp silicon valleys leading 
vendor of microcomputer chips on tuesday reported a 43 percent 
jump in fourthquarter earnings but said its profit for all of 1989 
fell 137 percent partly due to the cost of closing two of its 
oldest plants 
last years profit deterioration was caused in part by writeoffs 
connected to the closure of a santa clara fabrication plant and 
another decadeold facility in livermore said company spokeswoman 
pamela pollace intel will focus fabrication operations on its 
newer facilities in arizona new mexico and arizona she said 
another factor contributing to the decline was the dissolution 
of intels joint computer venture with siemens called biin after 
intel decided the company would take too long to turn a profit 
pollace said 
net income for the fourth quarter of 1989 increased to 123 
million or 64 cents per share from 86 million or 46 cents per 
share during the same period in 1988 
for the year ended dec 30 1989 net income totaled 391 
million or 207 per share a drop from the 453 million or 251 
per share reported in 1988 
fourthquarter revenue increased 16 percent from the previous 
quarter to 895 million the surge was a 23 percent increase from 
727 million recorded during the same period in 1988 the previous 
company record pollace said 
revenue for 1989 set a record increasing 9 percent to 31 
billion from 29 billion for 1988 
she attributed the increased revenue to higher demand for 
intels high performance chips including the ultrafast i960c 
chip the fastest 32bit processor to date when it was announced 
with much fanfare last august 
she said the decrease in profits overall was not affected by 
intels decision to halt production of a brand new supercharged 
computer chip the i486 which the company found had trouble 
carrying out certain mathematical calculations 
intel last year introduced three new microprocessors including 
the i960c and the i860 64bit microprocessor for supercomputing 
applications the worlds first onemillion transistor 
microprocessor 
intel which has been shifting production to newer plants in 
other states is building a new 400 million facility in dublin 
ireland 
the company said the high cost of housing in the san francisco 
bay area is one reason it decided to close its two plants in the 
region

unrest in the soviet union japans weakening yen 
and a decline in the new york market have combined to help send 
prices on the tokyo stock exchange plunging from recent record 
highs analysts said tuesday 
renewed buying interest is not likely before national elections 
in february clear up political uncertainties they said 
the nikkei stock average on 225 selected issues fell 66641 
points or 18 percent on tuesday after a fall of 65336 points 
last friday markets were closed monday for a national holiday 
these were the worst oneday plunges since 73191 points on oct 
19 1987 when the black monday crash on wall street sent stock 
prices around the world plummeting 
tuesdays close of 3685036 was the lowest since 3688153 last 
nov 27 
the nikkei average had ended 1989 trading with four consecutive 
days of record high closes so far this year it has lost nearly 
2000 points or 68 percent 
share prices were lifted artificially at the end of last year 
as institutional investors especially foreign securities firms 
bought up nikkei indexrelated shares in exchange for nikkei 
futures in program trading said keiichi nishida a dealer at 
kidder peabody securities 
as a result the nikkei index soared regardless of the market 
environment and since the beginning of the year those 
indexrelated shares are being sold off depressing the index he 
said 
dealers blamed the dive of the last two days partly on falling 
government bond prices caused by the weakening yen 
but on tuesday there was a combination of unfavorable factors 
hitting the market all at once said ichitaro watanabe a dealer 
at nikko securities co 
on top of the bond and yen worries and the indexs decline 
during the years first two weeks over the weekend the regional 
conflict worsened in the soviet union and the new york market fared 
poorly overnight aggravating the markets pessimism nishida 
said 
dealers said the fall in bond prices is likely to stop soon 
because yields are approaching the appropriate level around 7 
percent but a recovery in stock prices is unlikely before the 
february elections 
right now market players see no encouraging sign to buy 
issues said yoshiro inoue an analyst at nomura securities 
dealers said most private and institutional investors are 
waiting to see whether the elections leave the probusiness liberal 
democratic party still in control of the government 
the party in power since its formation in 1955 lost its 
majority in parliaments upper house for the first time in 
elections last july as voters showed displeasure over a new sales 
tax and sex and money scandals 
the february elections are for the more powerful lower house 
which chooses the prime minister and decides the budget the ldps 
standing in opinion polls has improved since last summer but 
uncertainties remain 
the unrest in the soviet union was also a severe blow to the 
stock market said watanabe 
he said the wave of democratic movements in eastern europe last 
year pushed up prices of shares in trading companies expected to 
benefit from expanded japaneast european trade 
hardly any new money is coming into the market watanabe 
added it it clear by looking at the volume traded on the 
exchange 
volume traded tuesday on the first section of the exchange 
where most major shares are listed was estimated at 450 million 
shares 
the dollar closed tuesday at 14575 yen up 235 yen from its 
1989 yearend close of 14340 yen despite recent japanese central 
bank intervention in support of the yen the soviet unrest and 
japans political uncertainty also have been seen as factors 
boosting the dollar

five big banks reported sharply mixed results for the 1989 
fourth quarter and year tuesday reflecting strength in their 
corporate and consumer finance businesses and weakness caused by 
shaky real estate loans and third world debt 
severe quarterly declines were reported by citicorp 
manufacturers hanover corp and mellon bank corp while security 
pacific corp and wells fargo amp co reported big earnings increases 
new yorkbased citicorp the nations biggest banking company 
said it lost 784 million or 252 a share in the quarter ended 
dec 31 vs earnings of 747 million or 219 a share a year 
earlier 
the bank attributed the drop largely to a 1 billion increase in 
its provision for possibly bad loans to developing countries as 
well as a 68 million cost to restructure unprofitable operations 
in britain citicorp said strong earnings from its gloabal consumer 
business offset weakness elsewhere 
for the year citicorp earned 498 million or 116 a share 
down 73 percent from 186 billion or 536 a share earned in 1988 
new yorkbased manufacturers hanover the sixthlargest us 
banking company earned 62 million or 82 cents a share in the 
fourth quarter down 705 percent from 210 million or 4 a share a 
year earlier part of the decline reflected costs from a previously 
reported fraud at its geneva branch 
for 1989 manufacturers hanover lost 518 million or 1021 a 
share reflecting an increase of 11 billion to loanloss reserves 
for third world debt in 1988 the bank earned 952 million or 
1827 a share 
pittsburghbased mellon said fourthquarter earnings plunged 
nearly 88 percent in the fourth quarter to 6 million which after 
payment of preferred dividends meant a loss of 20 cents a share a 
year earlier the bank earned 48 million or 102 a share mellon 
attribued the decline to the addition of 100 million to its 
reserves to cover possibly bad third world loans 
for the year the 17th largest us banking company earned 181 
million or 333 a share rebounding from a loss of 65 million or 
365 a share in 1988 when the bank had fewer shares outstanding 
the bank said the improvement resulted from significantly lower 
operating expenses as well as increases in service fee revenue and 
other revenue 
security pacific of los angeles the fifth largest us banking 
company earned 1917 million or 159 a share in the fourth 
quarter up 13 percent from the 1695 million or 146 a share 
reported a year earlier the bank said strong growth in its 
california and washington businesses and financial service 
operations offset big losses in arizona real estate 
for the year security pacific earned a record 7406 million or 
626 a share up 16 percent from the 6389 million or 559 a 
share earned in 1988 
san franciscobased wells fargo the 11th largest banking 
company said fourth quarter earnings rose 17 percent to 1585 
million or 295 a share vs 136 million or 245 a share a year 
earlier the bank said the improvement stemmed largely from 
increases in domestic loans 
for the year wells fargo earned 6011 million or 1102 a 
share up 173 percent from 5125 million or 920 a share in 1988

trans world airlines inc has sold 11 
jumbo jets for 210 million to two leasing companies in an effort 
to raise cash and reduce its large debt company officials said 
tuesday 
its the second time in less than a month that the airline has 
announced the sale of assets on dec 18 twa said it planned to 
sell its chicagolondon route and related assets to american 
airlines for 195 million that deal must be approved by the 
federal government 
the news has angered many employees who believe twa owner carl 
icahn is slowly dismantling the airline which is 27 billion in 
debt and lags behind other major carriers in capital investment 
but industry analysts say selling airplanes and leasing them 
back from the leasing companies is quite common 
most airlines are doing it to raise cash and take advantage of 
high values for aircraft right now said paul turk an analyst 
with avmark inc an aviation consulting firm in arlington va 
but with only 74 of its 213 aircraft owned outright twa has one 
of the lowest ownership percentages in the industry turk said 
twa spokesman don morrison said the airline will use half of the 
210 million from the sale of eight lockheed l1011s and three 
boeing 747s to boost its cash reserves to nearly 1 billion 
the airline will use the other half of the proceeds to trim its 
27 billion in longterm debt morrison said 
twa sold the eight lockheed jets to potomac leasing inc it sold 
the boeing jets to a unit of american express co 
icahn has assured employees in a letter last month that he 
does not intend to dismantle twa

frozen concentrate to the united states this year an amount that 
might not meet us demand

christmastime freeze that destroyed an estimated 30 percent of 
floridas orange crop and the market is on a collision course 
with the alltime high spot price of 205 said analyst judy ganes 
of shearson lehman hutton inc 
us processors have been counting on brazilian imports to make 
up any supply shortfall caused by the freeze brazilian citrus 
officials reportedly said tuesday that they were prepared to meet 
americas needs 
but the amount of prospective exports to the united states 
reportedly mentioned by umberto marconi administrative director of 
the brazilian association of citrus juice industries would still 
leave us consumers thirsting for orange juice ms ganes said 
the prospective brazilian exports of 450000 metric tons of 
concentrate would translate into 155 million gallons of juice 
based on my calculations we need to import about 200 million 
gallons overall this year to overcome the shortfall from the 
freeze ms ganes said that puts us about 45 million gallons 
short 
she said that between its 198990 harvest and its 199091 crop 
brazil should be able to meet americas needs but were at their 
mercy

mandatory random testing for drugs and alcohol 
went into effect tuesday for the 90000 men and women who operate 
the nations railroads 
testing began one year after drug abuse was singled out as a 
factor in a 1987 amtrakconrail crash near baltimore that killed 16 
people and injured 175 
the testing program delayed because a lengthy series of court 
battles between the government and railroad unions requires that 
at least 25 percent of railroad engineers brakemen dispatchers 
signalmen conductors and all other railroad employees directly 
involved in the movement of trains be subjected to random testing 
this year 
a full 50 percent of the operations personnel of the nations 
largest railroads must be tested by the end of 1991 for the 
presence of alcohol and such drugs as marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and phencyclidine also known as pcp 
but claire austin a public affairs officer for the federal 
railroad administration said federal officials expect as many as 
40 percent of those affected by the new requirement to be tested by 
the end of this year alone 
she said railroad administrators expect results will show that 
drugs are a far more serious problem among rail workers than is 
alcohol 
it is very evident to us that drugs are the problem rather 
than alcohol she said pointing to the results of postaccident 
drug and alcohol testing a requirement since 1986 
in that year 738 people were tested with 27 testing positive 
for drugs and seven for alcohol in 1987 770 persons were tested 
with 39 testing positive for drugs and just three testing positive 
for alcohol in 1988 682 people were tested with three testing 
positive for alcohol and 39 testing positive for drugs 
of 21 railroad accidents linked to drugs or alcohol last year 
14 were drugrelated while alcohol was involved in seven of the 
incidents 
the national transportation safety board found in 1988 that 
marijuana use was a factor in the jan 4 1987 accident at chase 
md which left 191 people dead or injured 
the board said drug impairment caused conrail engineer ricky 
gates to speed through several warning systems and into the path of 
an amtrak train 
the presence of marijuana was found in blood and urine samples 
taken from gates he was later convicted of manslaughter and 
sentenced to five years in prison after admitting he smoked 
marijuana and violated several safety procedures 
the board said the effects of the drug caused gates not to 
notice warning signals both inside the engines cab and suspended 
over the tracks until it was too late to make a safe stop 
at the time of the safety boards findings john riley the 
federal railroad administrator said it was clear a random drug 
testing program was needed 
it is not enough to simply talk about the impact marijuana use 
had on this accident riley said at the time if we dont do 
something to prevent it from happening again i mean authorized 
random testing then the lives lost at chase may well have been 
lost in vain

nations from the east and west nations took the 
first step tuesday toward creating an east european development 
bank that one official said could be working by the end of the year 
delegations from 34 countries including the united states and 
soviet union ended their first meeting by appointing experts to 
work out specific plans for the proposed european bank for 
reconstruction and development in eastern europe said jacques 
attali frances presidential adviser on economic affairs 
we need to be generous but also to help these countries learn 
what they need to learn to transform them into market economies 
said attali who had presided at the twoday meeting 
attali said three groups of experts would begin work and report 
their progress at a second session scheduled for paris on jan 30 
he said a drafting session would be held in paris march 1011 after 
which delegations hopefully would be able to sign an agreement 
the plan reasonably might be ratified and the bank established 
and operating some time this year attali said 
some countries particularly the united states have expressed 
concern about the role of the soviet union in the bank both as 
participant in the capital and eventually even a borrower attali 
said the issue would be addressed during negotiations over the 
draft plan 
disagreements among representatives generally were minor and 
would not stop eventual approval of the bank attali said 
describing the meetings atmosphere as constructive 
french president francois mitterrand proposed creation of the 
bank during a european parliament session oct 25 as a way to help 
east european countries which have removed their hardline 
communist leaders in the past year 
the money will be used for loans for projects in bulgaria 
czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and romania 
countries already burdened by foreign debts totaling more than 100 
billion 
the idea was endorsed in december at the summit of the 12 
european community countries which proposed a plan for the bank 
delegations on tuesday proposed several amendments to the ec 
plan using the amendments france will draw up a new proposal to 
be presented at the jan 30 session attali said 
attali listed seven issues the working groups would address 
the mission of the bank and whether it should fund only 
private sector projects or include the public sector this is a 
particular concern of the united states 
the conditions under which the new banks money will be lent 
whether at current market rates or in some other way 
criteria for eligibility to borrow from the bank whether 
those criteria will be based on the state of economic reforms in 
any individual east european country 
the amount of capital with which to found the bank attali 
said the current thinking is about 12 billion but no firm figure 
has been reached 
the breakdown of capital participation by each country attali 
said the question had not been studied but no one had rejected the 
idea of the european community holding a majority stake 
the banks method of operation who will run it who will be 
its directors and officers 
where the headquarters will be located attali indicated there 
was no shortage of candidates but refused to reveal them 
the conference participants were all 12 ec members france west 
germany britain italy ireland spain portugal the netherlands 
belgium luxembourg denmark and greece six members of the 
european free trade association austria switzerland finland 
sweden norway and iceland and the united states canada japan

bankruptcy filings released tuesday provided a 
6000page look at the crushing debts plaguing campeau corps 
department stores listing billions of dollars owed to 50750 
creditors ranging from wall street bankers to underwear makers 
the bankruptcy petition by campeau divisions federated 
department stores inc and allied stores corp listed 91 billion 
in total assets and 77 billion in total liabilities 
torontobased campeau the real estate company that bought 
federated and allied with borrowed money in the 1980s placed them 
under bankruptcy court protection monday because of the debt burden 
the divisions will reorganize under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act which gives them a reprieve from creditors while 
they devise a way to repay them and stay in business campeau made 
the filing in cincinnati where its most important us retailing 
operations are based 
the 6000page filing half of it a list of creditors was made 
available for the first time tuesday by the bankruptcy court where 
lawyers accountants and creditor representatives scrambled to make 
copies on two machines 
the biggest listed creditors were mostly banks and wall street 
investment firms some of which played roles in helping campeau 
expand into a retailing giant however while some listed as 
creditors owned the bonds others were only holding them in trust 
for investors 
the creditor list ranged from first boston corp holder of 
4288 million in federated debt securities to a 96074 bill owed 
to the hanes hosiery maker by lazarus department stores a 
federated subsidiary 
campeaus us holding company also announced g william miller 
64 a former treasury secretary and federal reserve chairman is 
the companys new chairman and chief executive officer miller also 
is a former federated executive 
the us unit also changed its name from campeau corp us 
inc to federated stores inc 
miller said holders of bonds campeau sold to finance its 
takeover of allied in 1986 and purchase of federated in 1988 should 
expect to take losses 
they bought speculative securities and they had high interest 
rates which were compensation miller said on nbcs today 
show i think the marketplace has already reflected in the 
discounts at which they are selling the fact that they probably 
will not be paid in full 
jack cowell a managing director for first boston called 
federateds figure on the debt to the investment bank vastly 
inflated he said first boston bought many of the bonds at lower 
market prices and that first boston had invested 75 million to 
100 million in federated bonds 
cowell said that despite marking down the bonds values at the 
end of 1989 the wall street firm had a profitable year in bond 
trading 
damage to reputations could be more costly in the long run than 
money losses for companies that invested in campeaus debtfinanced 
takeovers said perrin long an analyst for lipper analytical 
securities corp in new york 
you dont want to associate with banks that had a failure in 
that respect in the past long said 
the northern trust company which allied listed as its sixth 
largest creditor said in chicago the company holds allied bonds 
for clients and had none of its own the trust company said outside 
advisers had recommended the purchase of the bonds 
the filing was the largest under chapter 11 by an american 
retailer affecting about 100000 employees and 258 stores in the 
united states it also was the secondlargest ever by a 
nonfinancial company after texaco inc which sought court 
protection in april 1987 
harvey miller a new york bankruptcy lawyer who represented 
texaco indicated that the size of campeaus filing and the large 
part of the companys debt that is in junk bonds will lead 
creditors to create new legal arguments to pursue repayment 
he said creditors who dont qualify for repayment will try to 
come up with some sort of leverage device whether they call it 
fraud or something else 
campeau also announced other changes involving senior management 
at its us operations 
ronald w tysoe currently president of both campeau corp and 
campeau us will continue as president of the newly renamed 
federated holding company but he will phase out his 
responsibilities at the canadian parent 
john w burden iii chairman and chief executive officer of 
federated and allied has quit effective jan 31 to pursue other 
interests campeau said the company said it expects to announce 
a successor soon to run the retailing operations 
james m zimmerman will remain as president and chief operating 
officer of federated and allied the management teams at all 
department store chains will continue in place 
chapter 11 grants the companies a reprieve from creditors 
lawsuits while they formulate a plan to repay their debts all 
financial decisions for the companies must now be approved by us 
bankruptcy judge j vincent aug he declined to comment on the case 
federateds stores include abraham and straus and bloomingdales 
of new york burdines of miami lazarus of cincinnati and richs 
of atlanta 
allieds stores include the bon marche of seattle jordan marsh 
of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of paramus nj

fuji heavy industries ltd which owns 496 
percent of subaru of america incs outstanding shares proposed 
monday to buy the remaining stock for 6 a share or 147 million 
subaru of america has a total of about 485 million outstanding 
shares of common stock and the 6 a share offer would value the 
entire company at about 291 million 
some traders expect the bidding may go higher subaru stock rose 
1 a share to 612 per share tuesday in national overthecounter 
trading 
we believe that our proposed cash price is fair to subaru of 
americas shareholders especially in light of the uncertain 
outlook for the us automobile industry fuji heavy chairman 
toshiro tajima said 
only by controlling 100 percent of subaru of america will we 
be in a position to effectively integrate the manufacturing and 
distribution process which we believe is critical to the growing 
demands of our us dealer network and the interests of our 
customers he said 
subaru of america headquartered in cherry hill nj operates 
an assembly plant jointly with isuzu in lafayette ind which fuji 
heavy officials said would benefit from the merger 
i think the transaction will affect the indiana plant 
positively we hope to increase the manufacturing of cars and that

a young entrepreneur who sought control of 
bond corp holdings inc without explaining how he would finance 
his 197 million bid or deal with the australian conglomerates 
immense debt said tuesday he had abandoned his offer 
the statement from jeff h reynolds came five days after bond 
the brewing and media company controlled by millionaire alan bond 
said reynolds did not appear to have the capacity to undertake the 
deal 
bond had said earlier it was willing to talk to reynolds 
beginning with a news release issued jan 5 reynolds said he 
was negotiating to take over bond through his weatherby investments 
inc and its parent singaporebased california pacific 
international holdings co pte ltd 
newspapers and news agencies worldwide ran stories on his 
friendly offer to save bond which was near collapse under a nearly 
6 billion load of debt and related legal problems 
reynolds a 28yearold texan operating out of his mothers 
house in houston claimed he had lined up the 197 million and was 
negotiating financing to service bonds debt 
but checks by the associated press showed that weatherby once 
run by reynolds father lost its corporate charter in nevada in 
1987 after failing to file its annual list of officers the younger 
reynolds was never listed as an officer or director of weatherby 
the address reynolds gave for investors was a mail drop in 
beverly hills he refused to reveal the location in century city 
from which he said his associates were operating and he never 
revealed his source of funds 
he described the lapsed corporate license as a screw up by 
his staff or attorneys and even said he might undertake a hostile 
bid for bond after the company rejected his offer last week 
on tuesday he issued another news release saying his companies 
were withdrawing from negotiations with bond corp mainly 
because of the australian companys legal and financial problems 
last thursday bond corp released a statement from its 
headquarters in perth western australia saying it had been unable 
to obtain information about the proposed cash offer it said 
reynolds bid was doubtful and causing the company considerable 
embarrassment 
it was made very clear to mr reynolds and his associates 
right from the very beginning that there would be no discussions 
until bond corp was satisfied that mr reynolds andor his 
companies have the financial capacity to undertake a transaction of 
the size and nature he proposes bond corp spokesman peter lucas 
said 
in the absence of any such information having been made 
available so far despite repeated requests we are taking the view 
at this time that he does not have that capacity bonds 
statement read 
reynolds on tuesday maintained his offer had been real 
theres not much to say to detractors reynolds said i 
dont think its worthy of a response

the supreme court in one of two suits arising 
from strikes against airlines refused tuesday to allow a 
machinists union walkout at eastern airlines spread to commuter 
railroads 
the court also refused to revive a suit brought by trans world 
airlines flight attendants who accused twa owner carl icahn of sex 
bias in seeking wage cuts and other concessions that triggered a 
1986 strike 
the courts ruling in the eastern case resolved a question left 
by the walkout by the international association of machinists that 
began more than 10 months ago 
the justices without comment left intact lower court decisions 
barring sympathy strikes against railroads in new york city 
philadelphia and their suburbs 
the machinists who walked off the job last march 4 after 
refusing to give more than 150 million in concessions sought by 
eastern remain on strike pilots and flight attendants supported 
the strike for eight months before ending their walkouts in 
november 
the machinists and unions sympathetic to the eastern strike 
sought to extend its impact by setting up picket lines at 
facilities run by the southeastern pennsylvania transportation 
authority in the philadelphia area and by amtrak the long island 
railroad metronorth commuter railroad and nj transit rail in the 
new york city metropolitan area 
federal judges barred the secondary strikes and the restraining 
orders were upheld by the new yorkbased 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals and the philadelphiabased 3rd us circuit court of 
appeals 
in the twa case the flight attendants had sought back pay and 
other benefits from the airline 
the independent federation of flight attendants called a strike 
against twa on march 7 1986 two months later the union offered 
to return to work and accept twas demands 
the strike was called when icahn insisted on wage and other 
concessions for attendants 85 percent of them women that were 
greater than cuts he sought to impose against the airlines pilots 
machinists and other workers 
during the negotiations with the attendants union icahn said it 
would be easy for him to find young untrained women to be 
stewardesses for less than he was paying the attendants 
when union negotiators said janitors who belonged to the 
machinists union were offered a better deal than the attendants 
icahn remarked 
a janitor is a breadwinner who probably has got a family at 
home to support while you girls are second incomes and you dont 
need the money 
the union said the statement demonstrated bias against women and 
violated fair bargaining procedures mandated by the federal railway 
labor act which governs labor negotiations for airlines and 
railroads 
us district judge howard f sachs in missouri rejected the 
unions claims that icahn was guilty of sexual stereotyping 
icahns breadwinner remarks were foolish and offensive 
sachs said but he said icahn apparently was trying to rationalize 
his negotiating strategy of demanding more cuts from the attendants 
the judge said the real reason icahn made a more generous offer 
to the machinists was because that union could do greater damage 
to twa in a strike and because icahn believed it would be easier 
to replace the attendants with untrained workers 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld the judges ruling 
dismissing the case last june 
in other businessrelated cases tuesday the court 
said it would consider limiting the power of environmentalists 
to prevent the opening up of federal lands to commercial 
development 
agreed to a request by 34 states that it consider broadening 
their power to sue gas producers and pipelines on behalf of 
consumers allegedly overcharged as a result of ilegal pricefixing 
left intact a ruling that cities may fine cable television 
companies for failing to broadcast enough locally originated 
programs 
agreed to decide whether nonprofit social clubs that are 
generally exempt from federal income taxes can use losses incurred 
from selling food and drink to nonmembers to offset investment 
profits 
let stand a ruling that a state may ban pharmacists from 
selling prescription drugs at a discount 
blocked the effect of a lower court ruling that could have 
provided natural gas consumers with tens of millions of dollars in 
refunds the justices are to hear a formal appeal by 21 energy 
companies in the case in which a lower court invalidated a federal 
regulation that allowed gas producers to raise some prices 
the court also heard arguments tuesday in the california 
attorney generals attempt to break up the 25 billion merger of 
lucky stores inc and american stores co 
california officials asked the court to allow states and private 
citizens to use federal antitrust law to stop corporate mergers 
the attorney generals office argued that the clayton act 
passed in 1914 when congress was preoccupied with trust busting on 
a national scale empowers the state to challenge the merger 
less competition in the industry leading to higher grocery 
bills for consumers will result from the merger said deputy 
california attorney general h chester horn jr 
rex e lee representing the supermarket chains said only the 
federal government is empowered by the 1914 law to force 
divestiture in a completed merger 
lucky operated californias largest supermarket chain and 
american the fourth largest 
american acquired lucky in june 1988 to merge the two chainsder

general motors corp has ordered its divisions to 
cut or delay media advertising spending by 25 percent as the 
company continues to cut costs according to a report published 
tuesday 
the detroit news said it obtained an internal memo ordering each 
gm division to cut or defer media spending in the first six months 
of this year 
spokesman terry sullivan confirmed the memo tuesday he said he 
had no details on specific cuts and there was no firm target for 
cuts 
gm does not disclose its advertising budget 
sullivan said gm is scrutinizing all its operating budgets to 
see if they can be cut 
i think the key there is the term cut or defer he said 
defer it just means hold off spending for a time period and then 
see if we really need it and how important it is to us i mean 
everything in general i dont just mean advertising 
some of it is a retiming what it does reflect is increasing 
competition within the industry and the ongoing need to become 
cost competitive 
the memo titled 1990 quick start program also said gm 
would reduce sponsorships in motor sports and related activities by 
20 percent the newspaper said 
were looking at a lot of things said phil guarascio gm 
executive director of advertising i dont think the door is 
closed on cutting anything 
the nations largest automaker launched a 13billion 
costcutting program in 1987 to last several years as part of that 
program the company last week confirmed cuts that published 
reports have put at 1 billion 
car sales were slow in 1989 and the big three automakers have 
shut down or slowed production at 13 us plants this week to 
lighten inventories incentives launched in 1989 to try to get rid 
of slowselling cars have proven costly 
gm on tuesday reported a 404percent increase in car sales and 
284percent increase in truck sales for the first 10 days of 
january

japan will continue to voluntarily restrict exports 
of passenger autos to the united states to 23 million cars a year 
in the coming year trade minister hikaru matsunaga said wednesday 
the export limit for fiscal 1990 which begins april 1 is the 
same as in the current fiscal year although actual exports are 
expected to total only 2 million autos because of increased 
production in the united states by japanese automakers 
auto exports to the united states in fiscal 1989 are expected 
to be down again from the previous years level matsunaga said 
at a news conference although we consider this trend of decline 
constant for fiscal 1990 we will keep the previous years measures 
in place to confirm the tendency of decline 
the export restraint which dates from 1981 when the us 
government put strong pressure on japan in order to bolster us 
automakers has been considered obsolete for several years because 
japans auto shipments have been under the quota 
but it is still regarded as politically important to keep the 
quota in place while japan and the united states are at loggerheads 
over ways to reduce the 50 billion annual surplus japan runs in 
trade between the two countries 
wednesdays announcement was virtually identical to the one last 
year when the government said the export restraint should be kept 
even though exports to america were declining 
when the export restraints started japanese automakers had a 
big price advantage over us manufacturers but the yens rise 
against the dollar since 1985 has reduced japans price advantage 
japanese car companies have turned increasingly to making autos 
in the united states

competing paper company would violate antitrust laws great 
northern also contends georgiapacific would sell great northerns 
valuable land holdings in maine if it acquired the company 
atlantabased georgiapacific denies both allegations and has 
charged that great northerns management has resisted the takeover 
in an attempt to hold onto their own jobs at the expense of the 
shareholders interests

great northern shares have been tendered under the 63ashare 
offer 
the two companies also are haggling over how large a vote would

sessions sharp losses wednesday morning while the us dollar fell 
slightly 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which shed 
66641 points tuesday in the biggest oneday point loss in more 
than two years rebounded 36066 points or 097 percent to close

favorably to a 2325point overnight gain in the dow jones 
industrial average on wall street before slipping back dealers 
said 
a recovery in japanese government bond prices also supported 
stocks dealers said 
the recoveries on wall street and bond prices are major 
contributing factors for the rise said hisato haganuma an 
equity researcher with nomura securities japans largest brokerage

two weeks on sharp falls in the prices of government bonds which 
drives up interest rates and makes stocks less attractive

following four consecutive days of record high closings toward the 
end of last year

lawyers for a business newsletter said tuesday 
they would fight a court order that halted plans to print a 
frontpage story containing confidential information about the big 
six accounting firm ernst amp young 
the attorneys said the court ruling amounted to unconstitutional 
prior restraint and charged that ernst amp young made no attempt to 
notify newsletter editors that it was seeking the court order 
they received no prior notice james grossberg a washington 
attorney who is part of the team representing the newsletter said 
tuesday that in itself makes this decision blatantly 
unconstitutional 
carl liggio general counsel for ernst amp young told the atlanta 
constitution if we had notified him he would have gone to press 
and defeated the purpose 
arthur w bowman editor of bowmans accounting report said he 
was served with a temporary restraining order at his home the night 
of jan 8 while the january edition of the newsletter was at the 
press stopping him from publishing the article 
the issue was published two days later with a black cover and 
the word censored printed in bold white letters 
the order issued by new york supreme court judge beatrice 
shainswit restrains bowmans accounting report from using 
referring to disseminating or in any way disclosing any 
confidential andor proprietary information of ernst amp young that 
has come into its possession 
ive been in the newsletter business a decade and ive never 
seen anything like this bowman said tuesday 
the article was to have analyzed last junes merger of ernst amp 
whinney and arthur young bowman said his newsletter was the first 
to break the news of that deal when it reported it in the may 17 
1989 issue 
neither the accounting firm nor the newsletter would discuss the 
nature of the information in the article bowman said ernst amp young 
learned of the planned article when he called the firm to check 
some facts 
mort myerson a spokesman for ernst amp young said the issue has 
nothing to do with freedom of the press but centers instead on 
privacy 
this is an issue of proprietary confidential information not 
the first amendment myerson said 
a number of news organizations including the associated press 
the new york times the atlanta journalconstitution the wall 
street journal newsday and the newsletter association of america 
tuesday said they would support the newsletter in its attempt to 
lift the restraining order 
a hearing is scheduled jan 25 in the supreme court of new york 
on bowmans bid to have the order reversed
