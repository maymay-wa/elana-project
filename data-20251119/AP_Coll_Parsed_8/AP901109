truth has been critically wounded 
at the very least by partisan journalism that inflames the bitter 
ethnic rivalries of this patchwork nation 
yugoslavias freewheeling press once the most open of eastern 
europe has become increasingly provincial entangled in local 
conflicts 
the trend is evident in all six yugoslav republics but the 
staterun press and television of serbia seem to lead in the way 
headlines scream hellish police hunt on serbs over accounts 
of routine investigations in croatia an article on federal reforms 
aimed at creating a market economy is introduced with serbian 
economy knifed in back 
accusations flying between communistruled serbia the largest 
republic and the freely elected governments of slovenia and 
croatia have created such animosity that yugoslavia may not 
survive 
serbs and croats the largest ethnic groups in this nation of 24 
million have been rivals since 1918 when the country was born as 
the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes it was reconstituted as 
a communist republic in 1945 
political and economic differences accentuate the ethnic 
divisions in a power struggle that began with the death in 1980 of 
josip tito who founded the postwar nation and held it together 
croatia and slovenia want yugoslavia to be a loose confederation 
of sovereign states serbia insists on a modern federation with 
power still centralized in belgrade the serbian and federal 
capital 
slobodan milosevic serbias populist leader says he will 
enlarge the republic to take in serbs from other regions if the 
fedration disintegrates 
when croatian police tried to recover hundreds of guns stolen 
from government armories by local serbs banner headlines in serbia 
said croatian police throw serbian infants around and 
fascist terrorists sent to subjugate serbs 
stories below the headlines in the dailies politika and politika 
ekspres did not support the allegations they quoted 
wellinformed sources unnamed and not described echoing 
serbian claims that croatian police recruited fascist 
terrorists to harass the 500000 serbs in croatia 
poison seeps from the pages of politika in all directions 
said croatian writer slavko mihalic everybody is denounced for 
one thing or another and that includes any serbs who dare oppose 
milosevic 
media in slovenia and croatia have accused milosevic repeatedly 
of fomenting ethnic turmoil 
in the croatian parliamewnt deputy stjepan mesic waved a copy 
of politika and declared milosevic is guilty of stirring up the 
trouble in croatia 
belgrade television reported allout civil war between serbs 
and croats in croatia although no one had been killed or seriously 
injured 
to tighten the grip on serbian media milosevic and his 
communist supporters have fired or demoted hundreds of 
independentminded journalists 
after the latest round of 20 demotions the daily vjesnik in 
zagreb capital of croatia accused serbs of pushing their 
hardline concepts to the brink of intercommunal violence to avoid 
holding free elections serbia has scheduled elections for dec 
9 
civil war may be the last refuge for hardline communists 
vjesnik declared 
calls for fairness by opposition parties and independent 
journalists are ignored by serbian television and the 
oncerespected politika 
in june police with clubs broke up a demonstration against 
biased coverage beating several intellectuals and opposition 
leaders 
television did not show what happened and said protesters 
attacked the police a television newscast in croatia that included 
footage of the violence was not broadcast in belgrade 
twothirds of what the belgrade media say is lies said vuk 
draskovic head of the opposition serbian renewal movement which 
threatens to boycott the december elections unless unbiased 
coverage is guaranteed 
serbian television nicknamed milosevision in belgrade 
agreed to carry brief opposition statements it insisted all 39 
registered groups have equal time however even though only three 
have significant followings 
serbian television nicknamed milosevision by residents of 
belgrade carries short campaign speeches by opposition leaders 
only on its third channel seen in just onesixth of the republic 
ante markovic the federal premier is popular with yugoslavs 
generally but not with milosevic who objects to his 
marketoriented economic reforms and attempts to form a national 
political party 
markovic has described in the press as an enemy of the serbian 
people out to plunder our republic 
in an effort to counter such treatment the premier announced a 
weekly federal television program to present fair coverage of 
national issues tv belgrade refused to cooperate effectively 
keeping the onehour program off the air in serbia 
serbian media make their most abusive attacks on the ethnic 
albanian majority in the republics southern province kosovo 
albanians in kosovo have demonstrated regularly against 
milosevics abolition of selfrule in the province and serbian 
police have killed at least 60 in the past 18 months 
the serbian press portrays the demonstrators as terrorists 
who attack security forces with heavy machine guns and mortars 
no serbs have been killed or seriously hurt 
international human rights groups that condemn the repression 
are sworn enemies of the serbs and members of the us congress 
who visited kosovo were mercenaries in the pay of the albanian 
lobby the belgrade papers say

the bush administration hasnt uttered the 
dreaded r word yet concerning the economy but it is getting 
awfully close 
president bush on thursday talked about tough times and 
michael boskin his chief economic adviser spoke of the 
possibility that the economy could contract in either the final 
three months of this year or early 1991 
bush and boskin both avoided using the term recession but 
boskin opened the door to that possibility by discussing the 
chances that the gross national product the countrys total output 
of goods and services might decline in one or more quarters 
the traditional definition of a recession is two consecutive 
quarters of declining gnp 
the comments were much gloomier than administration forecasts 
before tuesdays elections administration officials had been 
talking in hopeful terms that the oil shock from iraqs invasion of 
kuwait might not be severe enough to push the economy over the 
brink 
were in some tough times right now bush told reporters he 
said he would consult economists in and out of government to 
discuss ways of cushioning the impact on american families 
in a speech to the american council for capital formation 
boskin said the economy at best is in a lull but we do expect 
that lull to be relatively brief and relatively minor 
he said the administration expects the negative impacts on 
economic output to begin showing up in the current octoberdecember 
quarter 
while the gnp grew at a modest annual rate of 18 percent in the 
julyseptember quarter boskin said that rate could turn negative 
in the current quarter he also said it was possible the economic 
contraction could last into early 1991 
the shortterm forecast if anything is even more uncertain 
than normal because we just cant say for sure what the size and 
duration of the oil shock will be the presidential economic 
adviser said 
the country last suffered through a recession from 198182 a 
slump brought on by the federal reserve as the central bank pushed 
interest rates to levels not seen since the civil war in an effort 
to battle doubledigit inflation 
the cure worked and in november 1982 the nation embarked on a 
record peacetime expansion 
boskin said the current oil shock unlike those of 197374 and 
1979 was occurring during a period of relative price stability 
for that reason he said he expected any adverse impact to be 
short in duration 
he said his best guess was that the nation would return to 
healthier growth rates by the middle of next year 
while bush did not elaborate on what programs the administration 
might propose to bolster the sagging economy boskin said the 
administration would review a variety of progrowth measures to 
include in next years budget and the state of the union address 
boskin said a renewed effort to enact a capital gains tax cut 
could be in the package 
in his remarks to reporters bush expressed strong opposition to 
further tax hikes saying the only way that democrats will be able 
to raise income tax rates will be over my dead veto

emperor akihito formally assumes the worlds oldest 
hereditary throne monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an 
important rite of passage for postwar japan 
no other monarch has ascended the chrysanthemum throne under the 
constitution enacted in 1946 
for the first time a japanese emperor is to be enthroned as 
merely a national symbol as stipulated by the constitution imposed 
by the us occupation after japans surrender in world war ii 
most japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial 
role of their new emperor a remarkable break with the past the 
late emperor hirohito akihitos father was enthroned as a living 
god and was the object of fanatical devotion 
even the official name the government has given akihitos reign 
achieving peace reflects a desire to move away from the 
turbulent times of hirohito who died of cancer early last year 
the monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century but the japanese 
public associates it most closely with hirohitos 60year reign in 
that period japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the 
emperor suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation then 
rose to become an economic superpower 
akihito 56 became emperor immediately after his fathers 
death but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and 
the growing of sacred rice for a coronation rite 
during the interval akihito has tried to create a softer more 
open image for the often aloof royal family insisting on fewer 
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people 
with the title san a term of respect similar to mr or mrs in 
english 
reflecting the different times in which they were raised 
akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his 
father and has pledged to protect the constitution along with 
the people 
empress michiko the first commoner to marry a future japanese 
monarch is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal 
household in large part by providing akihito with a family life 
similar to that of common japanese 
she broke tradition for example by making clear that her 
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers 
although the palace remains distant to most japanese opinion 
polls indicate it has wide public support few however still see 
their monarch as a god 
government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the 
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age they also have 
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly monthlong rites 
however creating widespread concern that the new era might 
actually represent a step backward in time 
royalty heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150 
nations will be in tokyo when akihito announces his accession on 
monday 
the main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace an 
oasis of greenery in cetral tokyo built in the late 19th century 
on the site of a former samurai castle 
akihito will ascend a 20foottall throne on a threelayered 
dais of black lacquer beneath an octagonal roof adorned with 
golden mirrors and phoenixes 
prime minister toshiki kaifu will stand before the throne as 
akihito in a reddishbrown kimono with a design of paulownia 
trees bamboo and mythical animals reads an address announcing his 
accession 
kaifu will lead the japanese among the 2500 guests in three 
rounds of banzai a traditional cheer for long life to 
conclude the 30minute ceremony 
officials say akihito will read his announcement in colloquial 
japanese unlike hirohitos use of stilted classical language most 
japanese cannot understand 
to reflect the postwar constitutions emphasis on popular 
sovereignty kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level 
with the throne instead of descending several steps as his 
predecessors did 
an official in the prime ministers office told reporters a 
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced 
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because thats the way foreign 
dignitaries are received 
aside from such cosmetic adjustments akihitos coronation is 
expected to be much like those held since his greatgrandfather 
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century 
in what many critics of the government see as a snub to the 
constitution about 25 billion yen 17 million in public money 
will be spent on a rite steeped in shinto japans state religion 
until 1945 
in that rite to begin 10 days after the main coronation 
ceremony akihito will step back into the world of myth for a 
communion of fresh rice with the sun goddess from whom the 
imperial line is said to have descended and all the gods of heaven 
and earth 
opponents say public funding violates the constitutional 
separation of church and state the kaifu administration argues 
that the money is not being used to promote religion but to 
preserve an important cultural tradition 
critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes 
during its 1200 years of existence it was ignored for more than 
200 years beginning in the late 15th century 
in response to questions about whether holding the daijosai or 
great food offering ritual is intended to restore livinggod 
status to akihito and future emperors nobuo ishihara the deputy 
cabinet secretary replied 
i am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period 
who claimed that through performance of the daijosai the emperor 
assumed a divine nature however the government is not in a 
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does 
not 
police have begun japans largest security operation mainly 
because ultraleftist radical groups have said they will disrupt 
the ceremonies a bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last 
week at a tokyo police dormitory killing one officer and wounding 
six other people 
late last month 26000 tokyo police officers were mobilized for 
security in the capital and at least 6000 more have been brought 
in since nearly 45 percent of the total coronation budget of 123 
billion yen 946 million is being spent on security 
a highranking national police agency official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the extraordinary security was 
justified because leftist radicals are planning to attack the 
palace with explosive rockets 
he said police believe one group has devised mortarlike weapons 
with a range of nearly four miles 
along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries including 
prince charles of britain and vice presidnt dan quayle the police 
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation 
akihito and empress michiko are to ride in a convertible in the 
30minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal 
residence at akasaka palace 
officials say about 10000 officers will line the threemile 
route

clad in white robes reserved for the holiest 
ceremonies emperor akihito will complete his accession to the 
throne by communing with the shinto gods in a room bathed in 
flickering torchlight 
palace officials say the communion part of an enthronement 
ritual more than 1200 years old has become an integral part of 
imperial succession and is an important aspect of japanese culture 
it also has given rise to heated constitutional debate and 
allegations that the government seeks to revive the living god 
status of former monarchs 
members of the leading opposition party the socialists plan to 
boycott the rite the head of the japan federation of bar 
associations has questioned its constitutionality and the national 
christian council of japan has collected nearly 80000 signatures 
on a petition against it 
the ceremony to begin just after dark nov 22 and end before 
dawn is known as the daijosai or great food offering ritual 
about 900 japanese dignitaries will gather for the ceremony at a 
special complex of buildings recently completed on the grounds of 
the imperial palace in central tokyo no foreigners are invited 
among the guests will be prime minister toshiki kaifu speakers 
of both houses of parliament the chief justice of the supreme 
court and the cream of japanese society 
ancient court music will be played as the guests are seated in 
two large tents a procession of chamberlains and palace officials 
clad in traditional kimonos will escort the emperor to one of two 
ceremonial halls 
in a lanternlit inner chamber well away from the sight of the 
guests akihito will be assisted by two female attendants as he 
begins the rite 
sitting on a bamboo floor covered with rush matting he will 
pray and offer newly harvested and polished rice to the sun 
goddess from whom the imperial line is said to have descended 
he then will join all the gods of heaven and earth in a 
communion of rice rice wine and produce from all over japan 
including squid abalone and chestnuts 
just after midnight the ceremony will be repeated in the other 
hall 
relatively few details of the mystical ceremony were known to 
the public until earlier this century 
because each of the inner chambers contains a stylized bed 
scholars have argued that at one time the rite may have involved 
the emperor symbolically having intercourse with the sun goddess 
thus becoming one with the divine 
palace officials say the bed represents the place where the gods 
rest until summoned for the communion 
iwao miyao deputy head of the imperial household agency which 
supervises palace affairs told reporters recently that prayers 
offered by previous emperors indicate the rite is not intended to 
bestow divine status on the monarch 
miyao quoted a prayer by emperor gotsuchimikado in 1466 that was 
an appeal to the sun goddess for peace abundant crops and 
blessings on all the people both high and low 
he said that prayer and two others had for some reason or 
other become known outside the palace miyao refused to divulge 
what akihito will say because such matters are intended 
exclusively for the deities 
akihito is to be the first monarch enthroned under japans 
postwar constitution written while japan was administered by 
allied occupation forces after world war ii 
although the charter redefined the role of the emperor from that 
of sacred sovereign to a largely symbolic one akihitos 
daijosai will be essentially the same as those of his father 
grandfather and greatgrandfather 
critics consider this important since the content of those 
rites was strongly influenced by those who wanted to restore 
imperial rule and build a national cult of emperor worship 
the cult was used later to rally the nation to war 
opponents also point out that the late hirohito the new 
emperors father renounced his divinity in 1946 they claim 
akihitos daijosai amounts to a retraction of that historic 
decision

bulgaria is more democratic a year after 
a politburo coup ousted stalinist leader todor zhivkov but it also 
is a divided nation heading for economic disaster 
many bulgarians were taken by surprise when zhivkov fell nov 
10 1989 after 35 years in power dissidents and ordinary people 
celebrated but there has been little cause for rejoicing since 
exhorting bulgarians into the streets of sofia the fledgling 
opposition forced talks in january with the governing communists 
who hurriedly began implementing reforms after zhivkov was thrown 
out 
in june as a result of the negotiations bulgaria held its 
first free elections in 58 years instead of solving the nations 
problems however the elections seemed to create more 
the communist party now called the socialists became unique 
among former masters in the soviet bloc by winning at the polls 
the stunned opposition union of democratic forces accepted the 
result but has seemed unable to live with it 
little has been accomplished in the 400seat parliament where 
the former communists have 211 members and the opposition alliance 
144 
it required six weeks for the assembly to chose a president 
former udf leader zhelyu zhelev and longer to approve an 
allsocialist government 
endless argument by deputies of the opposition alliance and 
divisions among the former communists have made it impossible to 
pass legislation on foreign investment selling state companies and 
other economc and political reforms udf members refuse to support 
premier andrei lukanov or join a socialistled coalition 
although polls indicate the udf would win if elections were held 
now many bulgarians are critical of the oppositions conduct in 
parliament frustration fear and tension have increased in the 
streets 
a mob burned the governing partys headquarters in september 
after smashing windows and demanding the communist red star be 
removed from the roof 
the charred walls and the empty mausoleum next door that once 
housed the embalmed body of communist founder georgi dmitrov 
removed and reburied in july symbolize the collapse of stalinism 
bulgarias economy seems about to collapse with the old regime 
and sofia is preparing for a bleak winter 
harvests were ruined by the driest summer in 32 years meat 
cheese milk and even bread are rationed and prices of available 
goods rise steadily 
power cuts to factories and homes are routine industrial 
production is down 30 percent from last year 
life is hardest for pensioners and the poor 
these food lines these prices this is death for older 
people said maria ivanova 64 waiting in a chill rain for a 
store to open 
we are eight people at home said stefka savova 61 who had 
waited three hours to find only milk and rationed bread available 
we have a 2monthold baby there and they give us just five 
cartons of milk i dont have sausages meat or cheese 
mrs savova a retired nurse with a monthly pension equivalent 
to 14 said she had thought zhivkovs fall was the beginning of a 
brighter future 
we expected things to get better and they have gotten 
worse she said i can do nothing only walk through the 
streets and cry 
legislators share the sense of helplessness 
parliament is incompetent and rather weak said dragomir 
draganov a reformminded deputy for the newly named socialists 
instead of either uniting to govern or splitting into into 
orthodox and reformist parties he said the socialists have become 
a deadlocked hybrid of stalinists and social democrats 
on the other side the the 17party union of democratic forces 
is united only in wanting the former communists out of power 
political polarization and the coming winter create perfect 
conditions for every populist draganov said and a succesful one 
could liquidate even the small gains we have made on our way to 
democracy 
petyo bluskov editor of a new businessoriented weekly 168 
hours expressed the public impatience 
what kind of moral respect can deputies win if they argue 
for a week over what their salaries should be he said 
opposition refusal to support the governments muchneeded 
economic reform program or accept anything less than the 
leadership of a coalition government threatens to dash hopes of 
economic recovery 
until the stalemate is resolved foreigners have little reason 
to invest in bulgaria a nation of 9 million with an obsolete 
industrial plant that relied on now vanishing supplies from old 
east european trading bloc 
you know why you cant find beer in bulgaria now film 
director angel wagenstein asked not because there is no beer 
not because there are no bottles we lack the tiny piece of plastic 
inside the metal caps which came from some other part of eastern 
europe 
the persian gulf crisis has been a serious blow 
iraq used to pay installments of its 13 billion debt to 
bulgaria in oil that has ceased and soviet supplies which must be 
paid for with hard currency starting next year are getting scarce 
bulgaria cannot afford to pay the higher prices on the orld oil 
market and stopped payments on its 11 billion foreign debt in 
may in september international creditors agreed informally that 
debt payment resume only late next year

king fahd is preparing to create a 
royally appointed consultative assembly edging the kingdom toward 
greater democracy in a move clearly speeded by iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the king told newspaper editors in jiddah on thursday that he is 
finalizing plans to set up the body to be known as the shura 
council 
plans to set up the council first were discussed in the early 
1960s successive saudi monarchs repeatedly have delayed its 
consideration partly because of opposition by religious 
conservatives 
the ruling family even built an ornate building for the shura 
council in the heart of riyadh a decade ago it has not been used 
it pleases me that the final touches are being put on the 
shura council and an announcement launching it will be made as soon 
as the final formula is completed fahd said excerpts of his 
statement were distributed by the official saudi press agency 
although fahd did not say so the move to increase consultation 
with the people was at least in part a response to the crisis 
sparked off by the invasion of kuwait 
crises provide the opportunity to do things you havent been 
able to do in the past said judith kipper a middle east expert 
at the brookings institution in washington 
ms kipper pointed to other signs of an opening in saudi arabia 
including the saudis allowing exiled kuwaitis to discuss 
democratic forms of government at a recent conference in the resort 
town of taif 
that shows a kind of recognition of the new realities the 
tide of history the changes in eastern europe the elections in 
algeria tunisia and jordan these are things the people have been 
asking for and for a long time she said 
the demand for greater participation comes mainly from members 
of the often westerneducated middle class who are impatient with a 
system of governance that leaves much in the hands of the royal 
family 
the shura council or majlis alshura is an appointed assembly 
prescribed by the holy book of islam to help rulers manage affairs 
of state it comprises mostly loyalist politicians and scholars 
fahd stressed that the kingdom has always been ruled by the 
tenets of islam that underscore the principle of consultations in 
all matters 
he said that the foundation of the shura council was laid down 
by his warriorstatesman father the late king abdelaziz who 
founded saudi arabia in 1927 
a representative body of local elders advised the royal family 
during the 1930s in the hijaz the countrys red sea province this 
local body gradually ceased to function but the idea resurfaced 
during a power tussle between liberal younger princes and king saud 
in the early 1960s 
when sauds powerbehindthethrone prince faisal formed a new 
government in 1962 he issued a 10point program that included the 
future establishment of a consultative council 
but after he became king faisal took no concrete steps toward 
implementing the proposed majlis alshura 
shortly after faisals assassination in 1975 king khaled 
announced that his government felt bound to complete the 
consultative council project 
but the subject was not broached again in public until 1980 
after the siege of the grand mosque in mecca and shiite riots in 
the oilrich eastern province 
fahd did not mention the proposals after khaleds death in 1982 
leading some analysts to observe that democracy was only discussed 
at times of crisis for the ruling family 
kuwait was the only conservative persian gulf state to boast a 
westernstyle elected parliament that parliament was twice 
dissolved in a decade 
a temporary assembly was elected in kuwait last summer but 
crumbled under the impact of the iraqi invasion 
other gulf states such as oman qatar and the united arab 
emirates have their own shura councils

painter rodrigo moynihan hailed by art critics as 
one of the centurys leading portraitists has died he was 80 
moynihan who died tuesday in london painted the future queen 
elizabeth ii in 1946 and prime minister margaret thatcher in 1983 
however art critics say many of his best portraits were of fellow 
painters like francis bacon william coldstream victor pasmore and 
victor willing 
though art critics praised him especially for his portraits his 
work varied widely from abstract expressionism to naturalism 
during his career spanning nearly 60 years 
moynihan was born in santa cruz de tenerife in the spanish 
canary islands off the northwest coast of africa in 1910 
he came to britain in 1918 and was educated at londons 
university college school from 1924 to 1927 he went to high 
school in madison nj he returned to europe in 1928 
early in his career he evolved a form of abstract

bulldozers will be chewing up the berlin wall for 
months to come but if a group of artists has its way sections of 
the old cold war barrier will travel the world to be exhibited as 
murals 
a year after the wall was opened last nov 9 and astounded the 
world one of the most prominent stretches still standing is 
decorated with 90 huge paintings each about 50 feet long and 11 
feet tall 
the east side gallery as the display of wall paintings is 
called sprang into being last january and the final painting was 
finished in october the work of german artist georglutz 
rauschebart it shows soviet president mikhail s gorbachev turning 
the communist hammerandsickle symbol upside down and parting the 
wall 
several russian artists are represented one by dmitri vrubel is 
a pensive portrait of the late andrei sakharov the soviet 
dissident and nobel peace prize winner labeled simply thanks 
an impressionistic turmoil of blue and yellow on a black 
background by japanese artist kikue miyatake is titled paradise 
out of darkness 
some paintings are cartoons some are political satire many are 
on environmental topics or on the theme of division the message 
that the berlin wall stood for in its 28 years separating west 
berlin from its surroundings in communist east germany 
the paintings stretch for 4491 feet along muehlen street in the 
former east berlin the gray back of the wall facing the spree 
river has signs beckoning visitors to come over and see the 
political art and buy posters tshirts and postcards 
we know only that we can stay until the end of march said 
annett tyra who operates the gallery shop everything else is 
quite uncertain 
the artists behind the venture hope to take a few representative 
sections of the wall each weighing several tons to new york 
japan and elsewhere to be exhibited ms tyra said but sponsorship 
money was still to be raised 
an east berliner ms tyra said the wall stood right next to her 
house and she had long accepted it as a terrible normality 
when the beleaguered east german communist government bowed to a 
popular revolution and ended travel restrictions last nov 9 in 
effect dooming the wall ms tyra said i had to pinch myself to 
make sure i wasnt dreaming 
a year later she finds east berliners show little interest in 
the wall gallery and also are not as idealistic about the future as 
she had hoped 
people are forgetting the ideals and thinking only of cars and 
money she said we need to remember the background and the 
reasons for this we see only foreigners and west berliners coming 
to see the paintings 
petra reetz spokeswoman for the office demolishing the wall 
inside berlin said she expected the east side gallery wall 
sections could continue to stand she said 81 percent of the 
downtown wall had been taken down as of the end of october leaving 
only 21 miles standing within the city 
authorities are making slower progress in dismantling the 81 
miles of wall that stood on the rural side of west berlin

forget his lips this time any tax increase 
will come over my dead veto says george bush demonstrating 
anew his knack for antitax phrasemaking 
but is it either good politics or good policy 
bush felt a need to back away from his hardline opposition to 
taxes last spring when he entered budget negotiations with 
congress as policy read my lips was not working 
but as politics the hardline opposition to taxes had worked to 
perfection in 1988 understandably republicans who thought it 
would work as well for them in 1990 were angry and frustrated by 
his retreat 
then came his first public comment on the midterm elections in 
which republicans lost one senate seat and nine in the house 
abruptly and to the astonishment of many fellow republicans bush 
rejoined the antitax ranks 
his timing was puzzling congress is not in session and wont be 
until january no one is going to be rushing into the oval office 
with a tax bill and demanding he sign it 
his declaration sounded more like politics than policy more 
like his statement of where he wanted to be in his 1992 reelection 
campaign 
republicans whod never abandoned the tax gospel did not welcome 
bush back 
whos he kidding asked lyn nofziger white house political 
director under ronald reagan hes got a terrible problem hes 
got to reestablish his credibility because at this moment he has 
none 
flip flop flip was the reaction of a republican operative 
who insisted on ridiculing his president anonymously 
never mind the poll numbers that have dropped but still show 
bush looking strong for a president at midterm a better measure 
of bushs political difficulty is the willingness of republicans to 
speak out unafraid of any potential presidential punishment 
two weeks before tuesdays 1990 elections bush got into a flap 
with edward j rollins the cochairman of the house republican 
campaign committee rollins had written a memo advising gop 
candidates who disagreed with the president on taxes to go their 
own way on the issue 
bush was furious he made it clear he wanted rollins fired 
rollins still has his job and the support of house republicans 
undoubtedly if the president is determined to get rid of 
rollins he can do it but the image of the president of the united 
states having to exert himself to dump a political employee of one 
of his partys campaign committees is hardly a sign of strength 
tuesday was a worrisome day for people who have to ask voters to 
pay more taxes that was why governors were among the hardest hit 
pollster mark mellman said if you look at the candidates who 
were defeated in state after state governors who raised taxes or 
whose party raised taxes were defeated 
the president said he got the message i think people feel 
theyre taxed too much he said 
once again he evoked the image of congressional democrats 
demanding that he raise taxes and theyre going to do it over my 
dead veto or live veto or something like that because it aint 
going to happen ill guarantee you said bush 
that guarantee must sound a little hollow to bill schuette of 
michigan lynnmartin of illinois and claudine schneider of rhode 
island all are republican members of the house who made tax 
opposition the centerpiece of their challenges to democratic 
senators 
theyd seen bushs success in 1988 when he was elected president 
after telling the nation read my lips no new taxes 
but this was 1990 and taxes suddenly appeared on the white house 
table in the election schuette martin and schneider were wiped 
out sen paul simon beat martin by 30 percentage points sen 
claiborne pell topped schneider by 24 points sen carl levin 
outpolled schuette by 16

the assassination of rabbi meir kahane has 
brought out the ambivalence many israelis feel toward the man who 
gave political shape to antiarab racism 
it was best reflected by the knesset israels parliament which 
banished kahane for his extremist views but honored his memory 
with a customary minute of silence 
kahane 58 was shot in the neck monday following a speech in 
new york el sayyid a nosair 34 was captured after a shootout 
with a us postal service police officer he was arraigned on 
murder charges at his hospital bed on wednesday 
part of the mixed response to kahane stems from the tradition of 
not speaking ill of the dead thus kahanes eulogists most of whom 
shunned and despised his politics are choosing to dwell on less 
controversial qualities such as his charity work his jewish 
defense leagues efforts to protect american jews and his campaigns 
on behalf of soviet jewry 
but few can ignore his blatant antiarab preachings and their 
strong overtones of violence 
hanan porat a rightwing religious legislator observed during 
a knesset discussion of kahanes murder that it was customary to 
refer to the dead as holy 
all the same i confess that it is not easy for me to talk 
about rabbi meir kahane blessed be his memory as holy porat 
said 
kahane was a provocative figure from the day he immigrated to 
israel in 1971 
most israelis blanched at his calls for the expulsion of arabs 
under israeli rule 
his harsh interpretations of jewish law went as far as to seek 
legislation banning sex between jews and arabs his eyeforaneye 
doctrine of vengeance often against randomly chosen arab targets 
was unpalatable to most 
his american accent marked him as an outsider 
he was a foreign implantation he didnt acclimatize he 
didnt have roots in the political zionist sense he didnt fit 
in said geula cohen a rightwing legislator who knew him 
the israeli media tried to ignore him except when his small band 
of followers attacked and sometimes killed palestinians most 
israelis felts his aggressive jewish defense league tactics had no 
place in a country with an effective army and police force 
his first two runs for parliament were abject failures 
he finally was elected in 1984 but whenever he rose to speak 
most members would leave the chamber in protest and they prevented 
his reelection in 1988 by outlawing racist candidates 
but two cabinet ministers went to his funeral along with the 
chief sephardic rabbi mordechai eliahu 
eliahu appealed to the mourners to leave the vengeance to god 
yet hundreds of kahane disciples rampaged through jerusalem 
attacking arabs journalists and leftists 
columnist yosef goell wrote in the jerusalem post that when he 
heard an israel radio announcer refer to kahane of blessed 
memory a common hebrew appellation for the dead i choked on 
my morning coffee 
he said the knesset members who honored kahanes memory were 
chipping away at the red lines which are so essential in isolating 
the main body of the people from the psychotic margins 
the mixed reactions to kahane may be explained by the fact 
kahane articulated the gut fears of many israelis especially amid 
arabjewish clashes following the killing of 20 palestinians last 
month on jerusalems temple mount 
while most israelis might balk at expelling the arabs they 
certainly worry about how to escape being submerged by the faster 
arab birthrate 
in the daily maariv newspaper columnist dov goldstein suggested 
that its an open secret that in the hearts of many 
ordinary israeli citizens hides a notsolittle kahane 
ron kronish of the americanjewish committee which works for 
better intercommunal relations in the united states and israel 
saw one good thing emerging from kahanes legacy a mushrooming of 
institutes in israel dedicated to countering kahanism by 
fostering civil liberties and pluralism 
kahane was elected with more than 20000 votes in 1984 and 
polls predicted he would have tripled his vote had he been allowed 
to run in 1988 
professor yitzhak galnur of the hebrew university believed 
kahanes kach party would dwindle mainly because it is being 
supplanted by homegrown substitutes one such group is the moledet 
homeland party led by a retired sabra general which advocates 
the expulsion of the arabs 
it is much harder for me to fight racism without kahane 
because he was a clear address galnur says the substitutes 
are more legitimate and local as it were and therefore it is much 
harder to fight them

the big franco zeffirelli production of verdis 
la traviata was new in october of last year so many in the 
audience at the first presentation this season hadnt seen it 
they applauded the second act scenery a sun room in a country 
house near paris and the dance entertainment especially dancers 
kyra nichols and fernando bujones in the party scene that 
followed 
the singing thursday night did not inspire wild applause or make 
one forget great performances in the opera heard previously 
tenor jerry hadley as alfredo came off best sounding sincere 
telling violetta he loves her in act 1 and vigorously denouncing 
her in the party scene 
in act 1 marilyn mims had a grand prima donna tone without 
voice good enough to back that up she was definitely best when 
singing softly in much of act 2 with alfredos father the elder 
germont and in the final act in her deathbed reunion with 
alfredo her final outburst just before violettas death was 
beautifully sung and involved the audience emotionally for the 
first time 
juan pons sang the elder germont his singing seems to be 
produced at the back of his throat maybe he was tired he has sung 
at the met four times previously in the past two weeks in a 
masked ball 
rico saccani conducted knowledgeably except that orchestra 
volume seemed up for the quietest act the last 
suzanna guzman a native of los angeles made her met debut in 
the small role of violettas friend flora she sang with the met in 
city parks last summer has sung opera in washington dc san 
diego los angeles and anchorage 
zeffirelli gives act 1 two parlor and two bedroom scenes that 
seems less objectionable than before on second viewing 
what is just as annoying is his having principal characters 
enter mingling with crowds when the elder germont arrives at the 
party just after his son throws money at violetta to humiliate 
her it should be a shock to see this authority figure appear and 
it would have impact if he had some space around him so we could 
see who it was

amid all the administration buildup and 
bluster about going after saddam hussein militarily a question 
lingers do they really mean it 
the question is relevant because a military strike against iraq 
was not what the american people had bargained for when us forces 
were first sent to the region 
president bush said initially these forces were sent on a 
defensive mission to protect saudi arabia later after the 
united nations embargo was implemented bush raised the stakes by 
saying the us goal in the persian gulf was to force iraq out of 
kuwait through a policy of economic denial 
lately however the rhetoric has changed not much is being 
said about defending saudi arabia or starving iraq out of kuwait a 
lot is being said about using force and bush on thursday approved 
a substantial increase in the us troop commitment to ensure an 
adequate offensive military option is available a defensive 
force has been transformed into an offensive option 
bush says hes had it with saddam secretary of state james 
a baker iii has been rattling sabres almost daily there is talk 
of a un security council resolution authorizing the use of force 
in august people gasped when administration officials said 
50000 american troops might be dispatched to the gulf now the 
numbers are well over 200000 and rising 
the administration with the help of its coalition partners 
wants saddam to believe his only alternative to withdrawal from 
kuwait is annihilation 
i would like to see a peaceful solution to this question 
bush said thursday if this movement of force is what convinces 
him so much the better 
as former secretary of state henry kissinger used to say a 
military presence does no good if the enemy thinks its not going 
to be used well the united states used force in grenada in 1983 
in libya in 1986 and in panama in 1989 
do those precedents impress saddam only he knows maybe the 
addition of three armored divisions from germany and one from the 
united states to the existing force in saudi arabia will help him 
make up his mind 
from bushs perspective there are powerful arguments for giving 
the sanctions more time to work there was never the slightest 
intimation by the administration at the outset that the sanctions 
would force saddams hand within 100 days of his invasion of kuwait 
a milestone which will be reached this weekend so whats the 
hurry 
beyond that bush and baker are fully aware of how military 
adventurism wrecked lyndon johnsons presidency a generation ago 
johnson campaigned on a peace platform in 1964 then escalated us 
involvement in vietnam quickly after his inauguration 
as us casualties mounted johnsons mandate disappeared and 
the democratic party has never recovered from that debacle it has 
lost five of the last six presidential elections after winning 
seven of the preceding nine 
the current tolerant public mood toward bushs gulf policy could 
change dramatically if bush goes to war without satisfying the 
american people that peaceful alternatives had been exhausted 
if an armed conflict produces casualties perceived by the public 
as unacceptably high and also sends oil prices shooting through the 
ceiling some analysts believe bush could turn out to be a oneterm 
president 
while assuming a more pugnacious public posture bush and baker 
continue to say their goal is a peaceful solution they hope that 
saddam faced with the spectre of empty shelves in iraqi markets 
and one of the most awesome concentrations of military power ever 
assembled will conclude that his best bet is to cut his losses by 
calling it quits in kuwait

the navy is considering mothballing its last 
two active battleships vessels whose reputations were tarnished 
two years ago by the uss iowa explosion that killed 47 sailors 
the commander of naval sea systems command told congress of the 
possible action thursday shortly after congressional investigators 
recommended that the navy decommission the uss missouri and the uss 
wisconsin 
i can tell you that it is under discussion said vice adm 
peter m hekman jr 
the wisconsin is in the persian gulf as part of the us 
military buildup there the missouri has been conducting exercises 
off san clemente island in the pacific ocean and also will be sent 
to the persian gulf the pentagon said thursday 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress said defense secretary dick cheney should mothball the 
last two battleships unless middle east operations convincingly 
demonstrate their unique utility 
the gao said the battleships 16inch guns have a maximum range 
of over 23 miles which limits the vessels ability to provide 
effective surface fire support 
in addition the operating cost of one battleship is 58 million 
a year and the vessels require a crew of about 1500 compared with 
about 360 seamen for an aegis guidance missile cruiser 
during the reagan administrations military buildup in the 
1980s the navy at a cost of 2 billion recommissioned four 
battleships that had been in mothballs since the 1950s 
the uss new jersey one of the four had previously been briefly 
reactivated in the late 1960s and served off vietnam 
the pentagon cited budgetary problems in deciding to 
decommission the new jersey and the uss iowa the latter the site 
of one of the nations worst naval disasters the iowa was taken 
out of service last month and the new jersey will return to 
mothballs in february 
on april 19 1989 an explosion in gun turret no 2 of the iowa 
claimed the lives of 47 seaman including gunners mate clayton 
hartwig whom the navy said probably set off the blast 
in september 1989 the service contended in a report that the 
sailor likely inserted a chemical detonator between bags of powder 
in one of the warships 16inch guns to commit suicide 
but last may a new investigation concluded that the explosion 
may well have been an accident caused by unintentionally ramming 
gunpowder bags too hard and too far into the barrel 
the new findings by scientists at the sandia national 
laboratories in albuquerque nm prompted the navy to reopen the 
investigation and halt the firing of the 16inch guns aboard the 
battleships 
the service rescinded its order on the firings when it sent the 
wisconsin to the persian gulf area in august but only after

despite the pentagons efforts to keep us 
troop locations in the persian gulf secret commercial satellite 
companies are selling photographs that could provide military 
details of the area 
pictures made available by soyuzkarta a soviet trade 
organization are among the finest unclassified imagery i have 
ever seen said peter zimmerman a professor of applied sciences 
at george washington university here 
soyuzkarta is one of three commercial firms that sell satellite 
photographs of the gulf the other two are spot image a 
frenchowned company and landsat a us concern 
spot image says it will sell pictures only to people with 
security clearances to prevent the images from falling into iraqi 
hands landsat says its pictures of the gulf region show only sand 
soyuzkarta says it tries to make sure only legitimate customers buy 
the pictures 
soyuzkarta which uses cameras aboard a satellite provides 
photographs with higher resolution than the pictures provided by 
the other companies analysts say 
the soyuzkarta pictures show items roughly 15 feet in size with 
computer enhancement the images are clearer 
zimmerman who has seen some of the soyuzkarta film said one 
could likely see the placement of large vehicles the site of a 
troop deployment and topological details such as trenches if the 
camera were focused on an area individual people would be 
indistinguishable 
the pictures would be very useful for iraqi and us forces 
in the gulf to help determine military information about the other 
side zimmerman said 
but jeffrey richelson author of americas secret eyes in 
space said a skilled photo interpreter is often needed to 
identify objects from satellite pictures 
citing security precautions defense department officials have 
gone to great lengths to conceal the exact location of the 
approximately 230000 us troops stationed in and around saudi 
arabia 
journalists are barred from taking pictures containing 
identifiable features and from using specific datelines in their 
stories 
rick obern a defense department spokesman said he had not seen 
the commercial satellite pictures but they would be a concern if 
they revealed operational information he said he knew of no 
attempts to block the sale of the photos 
velon minshew of fort worth texas a us distributor for 
soyuzkarta said the company has pictures of saudi arabia kuwait 
and iraq for the months of august and september the satellite 
orbits the earth every two weeks 
each frame showing an area 5060 miles sells for 1560 
minshew refused to say who has purchased the pictures but the 
company will sell to legitimate organizations who agree not to 
transfer the information he said sanctions imposed by the united 
nations bar the sale of material to iraq 
we are careful who buys the data minshew said 
clark nelson of spot image said his company sells photographs to 
the defense department we are not selling to the iraqis or 
anybody associated with the iraqis he said and only those with 
proper security procedures are allowed to purchase the 
pictures 
the washington times reported recently that iraq has obtained 
satellite pictures indirectly from spot image nelson said he had 
no knowledge of the story 
nelson said spot images pictures show a resolution of about 30 
feet the pictures sell for anywhere from 500 to 3000 
landsats pictures are available to anyone wanting them 
according to dick mroczynski a company spokesman 
generally the landsat pictures of the gulf region show a lot 
of sand he said the definition of the pictures is much less 
clear than in those sold by soyuzkarta and spot image he said 
landsats pictures were designed as a mapping tool and are 
often used by geologists and others trying to determine land 
formations 
television networks have not made wide use of the satellite 
pictures although cbs 60 minutes program showed a photograph 
purporting to show a uranium mine in iraq an interpreter pointed 
out the images 
spokesmen for cbs abc nbc and cnn said they networks were not 
using other gulf pictures 
john stack the foreign assignment editor at nbc said the 
network has used satellite pictures in the past to show among 
other things the nuclear explosion at chernobyl in the soviet 
union 
electronic images provided by commercial satellites are not 
nearly as sophisticated as the data sent by intelligence 
satellites richelson said

a female platyfish looking for a male in her 
life will always choose a guy with a long sporty tail fin 
according to research published today 
that bias says alexandra l basolo a researcher at the 
university of california santa barbara could have led to the 
evolution of a related fish species called the swordtail 
basolo says she proved female platyfish prefer longfinned 
fellows by sewing fake plastic fins called swords on the 
shortailed platy males 
the females went for the guys with sword fins every time she 
said but just why is still not clear 
it could be as simple as the fact that females have a 
preference for a novel male something new that theyve never seen 
before basolo said in a telephone interview 
whatever the reason such a mating bias by the female can 
dramatically change the appearance of a species over many 
generations said the researcher 
platyfish and swordtails come from an ancestral stock the genus 
known as xiphophorus that is swordless species in the genus all 
live in freshwater streams in central america some are popular 
aquarium pets and are raised commercially 
basolo said some evolutionary process occurred to cause the male 
swordtail to develop the distinctive thornlike projection that 
extends downward from the bottom of the tailfin male platyfish 
though related have no swords 
yet for some reason the female platyfish seems to like guys 
with swords 
no obvious use or advantage has been found for the sword said 
basolo the male swordtails develop the elongated tail only at 
mating age 
basolo said that in earlier research she proved female 
swordtails will usually select the males with the most impressive 
swords 
to test if the female platyfish had the same bias basolo 
selected pairs of male swordless platyfish that were matched in 
size and color then on one male in each pair she surgically 
implanted a plastic sword that resembled the size and color of the 
natural swords on swordtails 
on the other male in the pair she implanted a transparent sword 
matched in size earlier studies had shown that this clear plastic 
sword could not be detected by the female platyfish basolo said 
the transparent sword was used to make certain the test was not 
biased by the surgical procedure or by the effect of the sword on 
the males movements in the water this assured that the only 
obvious difference seen from the female point of view would be the 
prominent colored sword she said 
a threechambered aquarium was used for the test one male was 
placed in each of the two end chambers and a female was placed in 
the center chamber she was able to see both males and could 
choose during the test period the males and females actively 
courted each other even though they were separated by clear 
plastic chamber walls six pairs of males were tested with 9 to 16 
females each and a record was kept of the courting selections the 
females made 
given a choice between one of her own males with a sword and 
one of her own males with no apparent sword the female platyfish 
prefers males with a sword said basolo it supports the 
suggestion that female selection thousands of generations ago 
could have led to development of the swordtail species said the 
researcher 
if females preferentially mated with those males with swords 
then over time the trait would become fixed and all males would 
have it she said 
science which published the study is the journal of the 
american association for the advancement of science

two entrepreneurs hope to make their mark in the 
future with a business from the past 
mark kominkiewicz and paul yeh have left behind their jobs in 
the world of computers to become milkmen 
this week their lincoln park dairy service began making 
deliveries in a squaremile area with about 46000 apartments and 
condos near the affluent lincoln park neighborhood theyve signed 
up more than 50 customers to start 
the decade of the 90s is a serviceoriented era 
kominkiewicz said and we thought that this was a market that 
definitely could be tapped 
people like things delivered to their doors he added you 
got diapers you got pizza you got groceries and now were 
bringing back milk 
kominkiewicz 25 an account manager at a computer firm and 
yeh 26 a financial analyst there quit their jobs and formed the 
company two months ago 
they began deliveries before dawn monday kominkiewicz workday 
now will start at 230 am when he picks up the milk deliveries 
are between 4 am and 7 am the company also carries juice and 
other dairy products 
kominkiewicz said people who responded to their newspaper ads 
and fliers were lured by nostalgia or concern for the environment 
people remember how much better milk tastes from a glass 
bottle he said they dont get that cardboard or plastic 
taste they also dont have to worry about what to do with the 
glass containers because we collect them when theyre empty and 
recycle them 
the era of home milk delivery gradually began to end more than 
two decades ago said bob garfield director of technical services 
for the washingtonbased international dairy foods association 
customers found it cheaper and just as convenient to buy milk at 
grocery stores and now less than 1 percent of milk sales are from 
home deliveries garfield said by telephone 
but there is a small niche of customers who can afford to pay 
more and like the idea of buying milk in glass reusable bottles 
he said 
kominkiewicz expects his business to expand quickly and branch 
out to more chicago neighborhoods its not like youre dealing 
with a small town or suburb that only has 10 houses on the block 
he said 
by the end of 1991 he and yeh hope to have 1600 customers 
these people will come to rely on me as their milkman 
kominkiewicz said theyll see the same face at the door every 
day it wont be like it is at the supermarket where theyre only 
dealing with a name tag

dismissing influenza as an inevitable risk of 
winter could be a fatal mistake say doctors who warn that flu 
kills an average of 20000 americans a year 
the reason people die from the flu is it hits the body so 
hard said dr john d nicolas a clinical medicine instructor at 
northwestern university and head of a seminar thursday on 
prevention of colds and flu 
the most common misconception is its not serious said dr 
walter gunn an epidemiologist at the centers for disease control 
in atlanta 
most who succumb are elderly or people with chronic health 
problems they should be vaccinated now to be ready for the flu 
season usually beginning in december in some years flu claims 
twice or more the annual rate of 20000 
because of people getting together for the thanskgiving 
holiday traveling from other places spending a few days together 
inside the house thats a perfect environment for spreading the 
virus around said mary huck spokeswoman for the illinois 
department of public health 
flu or influenza is spread by virusinfected droplets coughed 
or sneezed into the air victims develop fever headache muscle 
ache and fatigue 
the vaccine is effective in 70 percent to 90 percent of people 
under 65 and about half the people over 65 gunn said it can 
protect 85 percent of the elderly from dying of flu or its 
complications because its symptoms will be milder even if they 
catch it after getting the vaccine he said 
yet only 30 percent to 40 percent of highrisk people get 
immunized he said possibly because they fear becoming infected 
from the vaccine 
you cant get flu from the shot the virus in it has been 
killed gunn said 
the vaccine protects against the three strains of flu that 
health authorities have guessed will be the most prevalent it 
changes every year and is good for one year 
this years strains are a shanghai a taiwan and b yamagata 
said gunn the names are the same as the strains covered by last 
years vaccine but this years a shanghai is a slightly different 
subtype he said 
the shot typically costs 10 to 15 at a doctors office and 
takes two to three weeks to produce immunity said dr jerry park 
a family practitioner 
traditional remedies are usually the only recourse for people 
who catch the flu bed rest warm fluids and overthecounter 
painkillers except aspirin in children which has been associated 
with the rare but often fatal reyes syndrome 
an antiviral prescription drug called amantadine marketed also 
as symmetrel is effective against type a flu if it is treated 
early lessening the diseases severity and duration park said 
when it comes to the common cold however about the only things 
that help are still the things your mother told you nicolas 
said get a lot of rest take a lot of fluids stay out of 
drafts do all the things that help your body fight the infection 
eat the best you can

alan cranstons decision to drop out of the 
senate leadership because of poor health opens the door for a 
moderate shift and avoids a potentially bloody intramural battle 
cranston announced thursday that he was suffering from prostate 
cancer in addition to leaving the senate when his term expires in 
two years he said he would not seek another twoyear term as the 
democrats deputy leader in party caucuses next week 
the 76yearold fourterm senator was facing his second 
straight challenge from sen wendell ford dky for the 
leadership post 
ford ran against him two years ago and lost but cranstons 
political stock has collapsed since then 
cranston is under investigation for his ties to former savings 
and loan executive charles keating whose financial empire 
collapsed at an estimated cost of 2 billion to the taxpayers 
ford has a voting record more moderate than cranstons liberal 
pattern and he is a far less controversial figure 
alan has been a respected colleague for the past 16 years and 
my thoughts and prayers are with him for a complete and speedy 
recovery ford said in a statement thursday 
few other changes are expected in the senate organizational 
meetings before the 102nd congress convenes in january with the 
senate remaining under democratic control george mitchell 
dmaine is unchallenged for majority leader and bob dole rkan 
likewise for minority leader 
cranston has been the deputy democratic leader since 1977 
including the last two years under mitchell 
mitchell called cranstons announcement a sad one for all his 
colleagues but especially for me his help and support in my first 
congress as majority leader meant more to me than i can easily 
express 
in the house which holds its organizational meetings next 
month speaker thomas s foley dwash and his leadership team 
are expected to return on the democratic side rep vic fazio 
dcalif is replacing rep beryl anthony dark as democratic 
campaign chairman 
there is unrest among house republicans however 
after another losing electoral season rep don sundquist 
rtenn is challenging the partys longtime campaign chairman guy 
vander jagt for his job 
sundquist denied in a letter to colleagues that his campaign is 
a slap at house minority whip newt gingrich rga who has been 
closely overseeing vander jagts operation 
gingrich himself barely survived in tuesdays election winning 
by less than 1 percent of the vote and there is talk that rep 
jerry lewis rcalif might mount a challenge for the whips job 
lewis chairman of the house republican conference was upset 
that gingrich was pushing rep carl pursell rmich to run 
against him sources said

nancy and christopher romei are 
wedded to each other and to the us navy like most military 
couples their country comes first when duty calls 
both are part of operation desert shield although they are 
1000 miles apart and havent seen each other in more than three 
months romei didnt find out for sure his wife had been mobilized 
until he had been at sea for a month 
this is our chosen profession being apart is just a fact of 
life we just accept it and live with it said romei 33 a chief 
petty officer aboard the guided missile cruiser uss biddle on duty 
in the red sea 
his wife is a corpsman and xray technician at the navys fleet 
hospital no 5 located on the eastern side of the arabian 
peninsula 
its part of the contract said mrs romei 38 he always 
told me he was married to the navy first besides this 
separation wont last forever its just a little piece of 
life 
the biddle was scheduled to leave norfolk va aug 7 as part 
of its regular tour of the mediterranean sea it was diverted to 
the red sea to enforce un sanctions against iraq for its takeover 
of kuwait and romei a native of leeds ala went with it 
his wife originally from valparaiso ind was stationed at a 
navy hospital in virginia beach va she got a call in the middle 
of the night saying she was being deployed in saudi arabia all she 
could do was send her husband a letter 
when duty called she was ready 
the navy trained me to do this job its time to produce for 
the navy mrs romei said during a break from her duties 
the military has separated them before they saw each other only 
nine days during a recent 18month period 
but this time theyre both away from home mrs romei persuaded 
a friend to take power of attorney and pay the mortgage take care 
of the monthly bills and tend to their two cars they have no 
children or pets but most of their houseplants became casualties 
of war 
it was like pulling my hair out trying to find someone to do 
these things mrs romei said 
unless things change dramatically the couple will be apart for 
their 10th wedding anniversary on jan 22 and she wont be with 
him to celebrate his birthday on jan 7 
but romei is more concerned about his wifes safety than about 
sentimental occasions 
im not comfortable with her being there romei said i 
feel a lot safer because im on a warship im designed to fight 
where she is a leaker on a plane or a scud missile could get 
through if they the iraqis thrust hard south they could break 
through i dont have any doubts about who will win ultimately but 
 
the biggest worriers are their parents however 
they ask why why are we here is it for oil or is it for 
principle and if its for principle why havent we done 
anything romei said 
meanwhile the couple had a common message for each other and 
their parents i love you

mayorelect sharon pratt dixon wants the 
district of columbia city council to restrict mayor marion barrys 
authority to spend money and make personnel changes until he leaves 
office in january 
dixon also called thursday for a 20 percent increase in the 
money the federal government pays the city yearly to offset the 
loss in property tax revenue caused by the presence of so many 
taxexempt federal offices 
at a news conference dixon urged the council to override 
barrys veto of a measure that would prohibit him from signing 
contracts worth more than 1 million for services or office space 
she also asked for legislation prohibiting government raises 
promotions or the conversion of temporary appointments to career 
service both emergency measures which would expire after 30 days 
will be considered by the council next week 
barry who is appealing a sixmonth prison sentence for cocaine 
possession has denied approving anything but routine contracts or 
making any unusual personnel moves but dixon said i wouldnt 
have urged emergency legislation if i didnt think it was at least 
a potential problem 
dixon council chairmanelect john a wilson and eleanor holmes 
norton who will become the districts nonvoting delegate to 
congress said they had agreed to lobby congress to raise the 
federal payment from 430 million to 516 million 
they said the 86 million increase roughly equals the amount the 
district would have received if the federal payment had risen with 
inflation instead of remaining flat for the last five years 
city officials have said an increased payment is essential to 
dealing with the district governments mounting deficit which 
could reach 200 million next year

rules proposed by the federal communications 
commission would require all telephone companies to provide service 
to hearing and speechimpaired callers by mid1993 
the commissions 50 vote thursday set into motion rules to 
fulfill the communications provisions of the americans with 
disabilities act of 1990

facilities and services need to be upgraded to improve the 
travel time on the new yorkboston run and to enhance the commuter 
services that share the right of way with amtrak skinner said 
speedy and reliable rail service would encourage more 
passengers to use the trains and this could help to relieve some of

a man convicted of sexually assaulting a 
woman who testified against him with six of her 46 personalities 
maintains she wasnt mentally ill and that she consented to have 
sex with him 
mark a peterson whom a jury thursday found guilty of 
seconddegree sexual assault denied he knew the 27yearold woman 
had a multiplepersonality disorder and said he will appeal 
i have been the victim for just having a fling with a girl 
peterson said he faces up to 10 years in prison and a 10000 fine 
during sentencing scheduled for dec 10 he remained free on 
10000 bond 
i still dont think she is mentally ill peterson said after 
the verdict whats there to be sorry about why should i be 
sorry for her 
the woman was diagnosed in february as having the disorder the 
diagnosis has only been recognized in the past decade 
she blinked her eyes and bowed her head as she summoned six 
different personalities to the witness stand wednesday four of 
them were sworn in individually 
the woman testified that one personality a 20yearold woman 
had sex with peterson 29 in a municipal park june 11 after a 
coffee date 
under wisconsin law it is a crime to have sex with people known 
to suffer from a mental illness that makes them incapable of 
understanding their conduct 
peterson testified she excited me she was pretty i 
asked her if i could love her she said yes 
district attorney joseph paulus told the circuit court jury of 
six men and six women that peterson who is married and unemployed 
exploited the 20yearold 
peterson treated the victim like a piece of meat at his 
disposal to play games with paulus said the woman is his 
little secret she is the person he can call on to have sex she is 
the mental illness he can manipulate 
the woman testified that peterson manipulated the personality 
that was prevalent at the time to force her to have intercourse 
she said the 20yearold didnt know what sex was her real 
persona she said was unaware of the affair until learning about 
it from another personality a 6yearold girl 
the jury which deliberated about six hours was asked to decide 
three issues whether the woman was mentally ill whether the 
illness made her incapable of appraising her conduct and whether 
peterson knew of the illness 
jury foreman david ward said a statement peterson gave police 
that said he was aware of the womans different personalities was a 
key to the conviction peterson said he signed the statement on 
june 14 only because he was tired of questioning 
defense and prosecution psychiatrists differed over the 
legitimacy of the disorder diagnoses and whether the woman who 
earned an associate degree from college was aware of her conduct 
the woman ackowledged that as a teenager she saw the motion 
picture the three faces of eve concerning a woman with multiple 
personalities 
psychiatrists said about 7000 americans have multiple 
personality disorder many of them having assumed protective 
mentalities to escape child abuse she said her adoptive parents 
abused her as a child 
peterson denied knowing of any mental problem until following 
the affair in his car she switched to a new personality after he 
drove her home 
i was very surprised he said i never seen that before 
he said he telephoned the next day to apologize and she told 
him im going to prosecute you you bastard 
defense lawyer ed salzsieder argued peterson was guilty of 
nothing more than bad judgment and promiscuity petersons no 
rocket scientist he said

sen alan cranstons decision not to 
seek reelection in 1992 because of prostate cancer has focused 
attention on an already crowded field of wouldbe successors 
but some of them may instead challenge the person govelect 
pete wilson picks as his successor for californias other us 
senate seat 
attracted by cranstons political weakness stemming from his 
involvement in the savings and loan scandal at least 10 democrats 
including former gov jerry brown former san francisco mayor 
dianne feinstein and walt disney corp president frank wells had 
floated trial balloons about challenging cranston or running if he 
stepped down 
likely republican candidates include former rep ed zschau a 
moderate who narrowly lost to cranston four years ago zschau might 
be challenged in the republican primary by a conservative such as 
former us treasurer bay buchanan sister of washington 
commentator pat buchanan or television commentator bruce 
herschensohn a former white house aide to richard nixon 
but the political outlook is complicated by the fact that 
californias other senate seat will change hands early next year 
wilson a republican was elected governor tuesday and will appoint 
a senatorial successor in january to serve until a special election 
is held in 1992 on the same ballot with the race to fill cranstons 
seat some potential candidates for cranstons seat probably will 
switch to the race against wilsons successor 
none of the possible contenders to replace cranston made formal 
announcements after cranston issued his written statement thursday 
most declined to comment entirely 
rep barbara boxer of san francisco who has been the most 
outspoken democrat about her intentions to run against the 
76yearold cranston said only that my concern is for alans 
health my hopes and prayers are for a full recovery 
a spokesman for rep bob matsui dsacramento said matsui 
intends to enter the race but there will not be a formal 
announcement for some time rep mel levine of los angeles said 
through spokesman elmy bermejo that he also is interested in 
looking at the race 
a spokeswoman for feinstein who narrowly lost the race for 
governor to wilson left the door open for a senatorial run she 
has said her intention is to remain in public life how that 
happens is unclear she will look at the race feinstein 
spokeswoman dee dee myers said 
brown currently the state democratic party chairman declined 
requests for comment he had hinted that he would run for the seat 
if cranston stepped down 
cranston also said he would not seek reelection by his 
democratic colleagues next tuesday to the post of assistant 
majority leader which he has held since 1977 his chief rival for 
that job sen wendell ford of kentucky also limited his remarks 
to concern about cranstons health 
cranstons written announcement made no reference to the senate 
ethics committee investigation of his relationship with charles 
keating the indicted former president of lincoln savings and loan 
who contributed 850000 to a voter registration drive and other 
political groups associated with cranston 
cranstons popularity has plunged since he was named as one of 
five senators who allegedly intervened with federal regulators on 
behalf of keatings savings and loan empire the thrift later 
collapsed at a cost of 2 billion to the federal government in 
addition to wiping out the uninsured savings of at least 22000 
mostly elderly californians 
in a survey last summer pollster mervin field listed 10 
potential democratic contenders for cranstons seat and found that 
cranston finished third behind brown and lt gov leo mccarthy 
who tied for first 
other prospective democrat candidates in descending order of 
support in fields survey boxer state controller gray davis san 
francisco mayor art agnos matsui and rep tom lantos of 
burlingame the disney corps wells and levine 
another independent pollster steve teichner said cranstons 
announcement would have no impact because i dont think there was 
anyone who thought he was going to run again anyway 
teichner said he didnt expect to get a clear picture of who 
might run in either party for cranstons seat until wilson names 
his successor 
wilson meanwhile refused to give any hint of either his pick 
or when he would announce t 
cranstons statement said his physicians told him his cancer 
is apparently totally curable but immediate treatment is 
necessary he added that he wanted to complete his final two 
years in the senate free of the burdens and the perils of 
campaigning and fundraising 
he was elected to his first of four senate terms in 1968 after 
two terms as state controller in 1984 he waged a brief 
unsuccessful campaign for the democratic nomination for president

most people who seem to do and say whatever they 
want while ignoring others actually care about their social 
maverick image and will change their stated beliefs to protect 
it a new study says 
researchers caught some of them in the act of doing that when 
they were judged too conformist showing such people pay more 
attention to others than they let on 
the study shows the appearance of being indifferent to others 
is an affectation to some degree said roy f baumeister a 
psychology professor at case western reserve university in 
cleveland 
but you also want to keep in mind that being recognized as 
something is a big part of being that way any trait has to be 
socially validated so its important to them that their autonomy 
be recognized 
university of florida psychologists barry schlenker and michael 
weigold decided to test independence using 94 uf students who had 
scored high or low on a test that measures in part 
independentmindedness 
schlenker and weigold reported their results in the october 
issue of the journal of personality and social psychology 
changing stated beliefs may be unconscious and certainly not 
devious schlenker said 
selfpresentation is part and parcel of everyday life 
theres nothing evil about it he said 
other psychologists disagree he said they say that while some 
people tailor their words and deeds to make an impression others 
are more autonomous acting on their inner beliefs and tuning out 
the opinions of others 
in the study the students first completed an opinion 
questionnaire that ranked how strongly they agreed or disagreed 
with particular statements about topics like religion and 
affirmative action they also completed a questionnaire about 
personal interests 
in a later session they were randomly split into two groups and 
told they were about to meet another student one group was told 
that this person considered them conformist because of their 
answers on the personal interest questionnaire the other students 
were told they had been judged independent 
then the students were handed another opinion questionnaire 
which duplicated some items of the first one they were told that 
its asterisk markings indicated which responses were given by most 
other students 
in fact this was bogus for half the students chosen randomly 
the markings made it seem that their own opinions largely followed 
campus norms for the others their opinions were made to look 
quite different 
the students were then asked to fill in this questionaire and 
told that the person they were about to meet would scrutinize it 
as a result some students faced this situation 
you consider yourself independent but youre about to meet 
somebody who thinks youre a conformist now you find out hes 
right if you fill out this new questionnaire honestly youll 
affirm that offensive judgment but you can look autonomous again 
if you shade the truth a little 
as a group people with that dilemma changed their expressed 
opinions away from those they thought were conformist 
if by expressing their real attitudes it made them look 
dependent they misrepresented their attitudes to reestablish an 
image of autonomy schlenker said

polish officials are elated by german 
chancellor helmut kohls unexpected decision to sign within three 
weeks a treaty confirming his countrys longdisputed border with 
poland 
the decision to move up the signing is also a political boost 
for prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
one of the most thorny problems disappears from the 
polishgerman front the promazowiecki daily gazeta wyborcza 
said today of the development 
kohl and mazowiecki met thursday along the oder river and 
decided that the 45year dispute over the polishgerman border 
would finally be laid to rest with a treatysigning ceremony in 
warsaw before the end of the month 
the line on the oder and neisse rivers drawn by the victorious 
allies after world war ii gave poland 40000 square miles of 
former german territory in silesia pomerania and east prussia the 
acquired territory is onethird of todays poland 
the border was originally meant to be provisional pending a 
postwar peace treaty that never took place it created tension 
between poland and germany for decades and rightwing german 
politicians called for restoring some or all of the land to 
germany 
although germany already had promised to accept the border as 
part of the process that led to german unification oct 3 the 
treaty was not expected to be signed until next year 
the kohl government had sought to link it to a larger friendship 
pact that would include guarantees of human rights for up to 1 
million ethnic germans who remain in poland 
a german official traveling with kohl privately described the 
decision to speed up the border treaty as a gift to mazowiecki who 
is locked in an uphill campaign for president against solidarity 
chairman lech walesa 
the treaty is to be signed by foreign minister krzysztof 
skubiszewski and german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher it 
was possible it could be signed even before polish elections on 
nov 25 
briefing reporters after the summit in the polish border town of 
slubice mazowiecki expressed deep satisfaction with the 
important results and the good will showed by kohl 
beside the early signing of the border treaty he pointed to 
progress on a range of polishgerman issues including the kohl 
governments intention to abolish by christmas mandatory visas for 
poles traveling to germany 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said the germans 
accepted polands view on the delicate issue of its ethnic german 
minority that ethnic germans will have rights on a par with other 
ethnic groups in poland and generally accepted european standards 
there had been calls in germany for extending them special 
status or even dual polish and german citizenship 
the two leaders also agreed to upgrade the 372mile road linking 
warsaw and berlin much of which is only two lanes to remove trade 
barriers and to establish additional border crossings

late one spring night toru yuge stood up and 
reached for a book from a shelf above the window in his 
secondfloor study 
immediately after he sat down at a low table beneath the window 
two bullets shot throught the pane sending shards of glass across 
the room 
the gunshots were also sending a message to yuge 
i thought that we would be harassed by ultrarightists but i 
didnt expect that kind of attack so suddenly said the 
softspoken yuge president of tokyos ferris university 
a few days before the shooting he and the presidents of three 
other japanese christian colleges had issued a statement 
criticizing government plans to sponsor enthronement ceremonies for 
emperor akihito 
they and other opponents charge that the rites violate the 
constitutions separation of religion and state and say the 
government is using virtually the same shinto ceremonies that made 
akihitos father and grandfather living gods 
in planning the ceremonies the government has basically 
returned to the prewar laws that were deleted from the postwar 
constitution yuge says they are reinstating the idea that the 
emperor is god and thereby going completely against the current 
constitution 
yuge 66 says he and the other presidents continue to receive 
harassing phone calls and remain under police protection he now 
closes the shutters before working at home and informs the police 
each morning of his plans for the day 
twentyfive other university presidents have since joined in 
supporting their statement although others declined out of fear 
yuge says 
this is an issue that will have a strong impact on japans 
future so its natural that there are strong feelings on both 
sides he says but because of its importance we need to be 
able to discuss it openly without the threat of violence on either 
side 
many japanese between the political extremes see the coronation 
rites that begin monday as quaint mysterious observances far 
removed from their lives in a poll released wednesday by the 
nippon television network nearly half the respondents said they 
had no interest 
but others say the ceremonies have profound implications for 
japans political future 
japans constitution written under us guidance during the 
allied occupation after world war ii changed the emperors status 
from living god to symbol of the state 
but critics say the rites are an attempt to once again redefine 
and strengthen the emperors role by linking it with shinto 
religion and myth 
the cabinet including the prime minister and imperial 
household agency is doing something unforgivable says yuge 
the government and the business circles behind it want to 
strengthen the emperor to extend their own authority so its a 
very important turning point 
yoshiyasu kawane a japanese history professor at osaka city 
university says the government has planned the rites to be as 
similar as possible to the enthronements of the past two emperors 
it was during that period that the government reformed 
shintoism japans highly decentralized indigenous religion into a 
centralized state religion used to glorify the emperor and rally 
support for the government especially during world war ii 
the government is trying to create a unifying nationalistic 
force using the same process as in the past kawane says for 
example the parliament is debating a law that would allow the 
dispatch of japanese troops overseas what purpose would japanese 
soldiers be willing to die for now not very many people want to 
die for the prime minister 
opponents particularly criticize the planned use during 
akihitos enthronement of a 20foothigh royal said to be patterned 
after one used by the sun goddess thus conveying divinity 
in osaka more than 1500 people including buddhists 
catholics protestants lawyers and academics have filed suit in 
an attempt to block the use of government funds for the 
enthronement 
japans largest christian organization the national christian 
council of japan has gathered 130000 signatures on a petition 
condemning state funding of the nov 2223 daijosai or great 
food offering ritual 
more than 1000 people will participate in a 100hour hunger 
strike beginning nov 19 in another protest 
in the daijosai akihito is to hold an overnight communion 
with the sun goddess from whom the imperial line is said to have 
descended rightists believe the emperor is reborn as a living god 
following a union between the two 
the socialist party the largest opposition group plans to 
boycott the rite and leading lawyers have questioned its 
constitutionality 
while ultrarightists support a stronger role for the emperor 
ultraleftists demand the abolition of the imperial system and have 
vowed to disrupt the enthronement 
police count more than 60 violent leftist attacks this year 
more than twice the number in 1989 including bombing nov 1 that 
killed a policeman 
but yuge says the harassment will not keep him from speaking 
out this week he released another statement condemning the use of 
violence by both sides to suppress freedom of speech

the cropdestroying mediterranean fruit 
fly has been wiped out in california after a 52 million campaign 
that lasted 15 months officials said 
were here to celebrate that we have eradicated the medfly in 
california jack parnell deputy secretary of the us department 
of agriculture said during a news conference thursday with state 
agriculture chief henry voss 
they officially lifted a quarantine barring movement of fruit 
and vegetables from infested areas medfly traps will continue to 
be placed statewide to detect any new arrivals 
the arrival of illegal fruit and vegetables usually carried in 
travelers luggage virtually ensures future infestations one 
official said in an interview last weekend 
there is some perverse streak in human nature they seem to 
believe its fun to outsmart authorities and bring in just one 
mango or just one pineapple from hawaii said gera curry 
spokeswoman for the state department of food and agriculture all 
it takes is one person 
quarantines had been imposed because of worries that medflies 
could spread from urban southern california to rural agricultural 
areas and wreck the states 18 billionayear farming economy 
slightly smaller than a common housefly the medfly lays its 
eggs in fruit and vegetables the can afflict hundreds of different 
plant varieties 
florida declared victory over the medfly in august four months 
after finding a single fly near miami international airport 
the medfly has plagued california farmers since the early 1980s 
from 1980 to 1982 state and federal officials spent 100 million to 
battle the pest 
the latest infestation caused a public outcry when the state 
repeatedly sent helicopters to spray the pesticide malathion over 
dozens of communities in a 500squaremile area citizens filed 300 
damage claims and numerous lawsuits 
there is no health hazard related to malathion in the amounts 
we use voss said 
but he added its something we hope we wont have to do 
again we hope science can come up with alternatives 
roy cunningham chairman of the state medfly science advisory

new york city has taken another step to curb 
cigarette smoking the city council voted overwhelmingly to ban the 
sale of cigarette vending machines in most public places to keep 
minors from buying smokes 
mayor david dinkins a former twopackaday smoker is expected 
to sign the bill into law the council passed it 331 on thursday 
the move makes new york the largest city in the country to 
restrict cigarette vending machines councilman sal albanese said 
salt lake city and minneapolis have enacted similar bans 
the city already prohibits the distribution of free cigarettes 
on the street and plans to phase out cigarette advertising on 
cityowned billboards on taxis at baseball stadiums and in the 
subways said councilman joseph lisa 
tobacco industry officials decried the latest ban 
the tobacco industry agrees with the goal of keeping 
cigarettes out of the hands of kids but it is a misguided notion 
to think that by banning cigarette vending machines thats what 
youre going to accomplish said brennan dawson a spokeswoman 
for the washingtonbased tobacco institute 
she said 30 percent of cigarette machines are located in bars 
where children are not supposed to be anyway 
a spokesman for cigarette maker philip morris inc les zuke 
called the legislation unnecessary and an overreaction he 
said vending machines account for only 3 percent of cigarette 
sales 
the bill allows machines in taverns and bars in hotels and 
motels as long as they are within sight of the owner or operator 
who is supposed to stop minors from buying state law bans the sale 
of cigarettes to those under age 18 
the bill would ban machines from such places as restaurants 
bowling alleys and theaters violations could result in fines 
ranging from not more than 300 for the first offense to 1000 for 
the third any subsequent violations could result in suspension of 
cigarette licenses for up to one year 
councilman jerome odonovan the lone dissenter said he doubted 
the law would be enforceable and that youngsters still could get 
cigarettes by buying them acrossthecounter 
the music cigarette amp amusement association inc representing 
over 150 small businesses in the vending machine industry said in 
october the proposed ban would result in the loss of jobs for 2000 
unskilled and semiskilled workers in the city 
also on thursday patrick halpin the executive of suffolk 
county on new yorks long island vetoed legislation meant to 
restrict access to cigarette vending machines because it was not 
strong enough

despite spending billions of dollars 
on air defenses and antitank weapons and plans to double the size 
of its army saudi arabia will still be unable to fend off a 
fullscale iraqi attack alone 
unless saddam husseins formidable military machine is crippled 
in the gulf confrontation that means a sizeable western military 
presence will almost certainly have to remain in the region for 
some time to come 
the saudis have spent an estimated 40 billion on advanced 
weapons systems over the past decade but they were unable to take 
on saddams millionstrong military juggernaut when it crushed 
kuwait in august and appeared to threaten the saudis own desert 
kingdom 
king fahd had little option but to appeal for us and allied 
help to protect a country which contains islams holiest shrines 
despite an outcry by some moslem hardliners 
the crisis has benefited the saudis inasmuch as the threat to 
their oilfields overcame the proisrael lobby in the us congress 
which for years blocked the sale of stateoftheart weaponry to 
riyadh on the grounds it was technically at war with israel 
now the americans have pledged to sell the saudis some 20 
billion worth of sophisticated hardware including f15 cd eagle 
fighters patriot missiles 350 m1a2 abrams tanks and 500 bradley 
fighting vehicles 
but even after delivery of the new arsenal over the next two or 
three years analysts say the saudis will be unable to take on 
saddam alone if hes still around 
the saudi defense plan relied on being able to hold the 
attackers off for long enough to get outside assistance said 
nadav safran a professor of middle east studies at harvard 
university 
when saddams troops marched into kuwait the saudis realized 
that even after two decades of beefing up their defenses they 
still didnt have the capacity to hold him off even for a few 
days said safran who is the author of saudi arabia the 
ceaseless quest for security 
king fahd and his defense minister prince sultan are planning 
to more than double the size of the 65000man regular saudi armed 
forces which is supported by a 56000man national guard 
it is unclear where the recruits will come from saudi arabia 
which is as large as the united states east of the mississippi has 
only about 8 million citizens and has long suffered from a shortage 
of men of military age as in most gulf countries the saudi 
military is a volunteer force and no plans have been announced for 
conscription 
according to the governmentcontrolled press 50000 men have 
volunteered for the kingdoms citizens army since aug 2 the 
volunteers receive one months military training 
in the event of war these hastily trained troops are supposed 
to be integrated into regular army units 
merging the regular armed forces headed by prince sultan with 
the national guard commanded by crown prince abdullah has been 
ruled out for the time being 
fahd reportedly favored such a move a decade ago when he was 
crown prince but he was overruled by other members of the royal 
family wisely according to safran because of the threat to the 
monarchy posed by a large army 
even if they should merge the army and national guard they 
couldnt develop a capacity to defend themselves against challenges 
like that presented by iraq safran said 
so to run the risk of a military coup just for the sake of 
developing an army that couldnt even guard against the main danger 
anyway doesnt make sense 
the saudi air force has 179 combat aircraft to iraqs 500plus 
and 550 battle tanks to saddams 5500 
the new us arms package is a key element in the saudi plan to 
bolster its military but us representative mel levine contends 
that the saudis still couldnt defend themselves no matter how 
goldplated their equipment is 
levine an israel supporter and critic of the proposed arms 
sales argues the administration is using the invasion of kuwait as 
a pretext to overcome the proisrael lobbys influence 
despite the saudi military buildup the kingdom will still have 
to rely on balancing regional powers with money and diplomacy 
rather than on military might 
that is how the saudis have coped with regional threats in the 
past including a rebellion in neighboring yemen backed by the late 
egyptian president gamal abdel nasser in the 1960s and the 
eightyear iraniraq war

minors trying to buy cigarettes have a 2outof3 
chance of succeeding according to an undercover operation that 
tested one states law against selling smokes to people under age 
18 
federal health oficials reported thursday that colorados 1987 
law prohibiting merchants from selling tobacco to minors and 
prohibiting youngsters from buying wasnt working too well 
the national centers for disease control said many vendors may 
not be familiar with this law and some may believe enforcement 
is unlikely or that the profits from cigarette sales to minors 
outweigh possible financial penalties for violating the law 
the fine for violations by merchants or juveniles is only 25 
said walter young director of the prevention programs division of 
the colorado department of health 
the coalition for a tobaccofree colorado a consortium of 
public and private health organizations sent 11 young volunteer 
teams to 121 sites to see if the children could buy tobacco at 77 
sites or 64 percent they were successful 
its disappointing that merchants have not gotten the message 
that theyre not supposed to sell to kids young said 
all 24 times that minor volunteers went to a cigarette machine 
no one stopped them the 97 other attempts involved vendors or 
sales clerks 53 of those were successful 
colorados cigarette snoops ranged from age 9 to 17 the survey 
was done in august 1989 
sales clerks did not appear to discriminate in their sales 
practices between very young adolescents and those closer to legal 
age the cdc said 
among those buying from sales clerks the success rate for 
volunteers ages 1517 was 55 percent virtually identical to the 54 
percent success rate for the other volunteers 
options that could cut down on illegal cigarette sales include 
banning cigarette machines but machines account for less than 10 
percent of sales to minors young noted 
since the survey colorado health officials have distributed 
pamphlets door stickers and display signs to merchants to 
encourage compliance with the law young said 
the cdc said that the minors participating in the project didnt 
actually break the law they approached machines but didnt buy 
and they told any helpful clerks they didnt have enough money for 
the purchase

socialist chandra shekhar facing a 
nation bloodied by religious and ethnic strife was named indias 
new prime minister today 
chandra shekhar the dissident leader who helped topple prime 
minister vp singh and his government on wednesday will be sworn 
in saturday and will seek parliaments endorsement by nov 20 
president ramaswamy venkataraman announced 
the president said he chose chandra shekhar because he has the 
strength to form a viable government with the support of the 
congress party of former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
venkataraman said he offered three other parties the chance to 
form a government but all refused 
it will not be in the national interest to plunge the country 
into a general election at this time and every effort should be 
made to provide the country with a reasonably stable government 
said the statement 
chandra shekhar 63 appearing composed as he spoke to reporters 
outside the presidential palace after a 35minute meeting with the 
president 
the president was satisfied i am able to form the 
government he said but he declined to discuss his cabinet or 
his agenda 
asked what his immediate programs would be he said 
priorities i shall discuss after tomorrows swearingin 
later he told reporters he felt nothing special after being 
named prime ministerdesignate i am as normal as always he 
said 
singh resigned wednesday after losing a parliamentary vote of 
confidence the same day 
chandra shakhars first challenge will be to stem a wave of 
violence between indias hindu majority and moslem minority 
at least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in riots 
sparked by a hindu fundamentalist attempt to replace a mosque with 
a temple in the hindu holy town of ayodhya 
about 150 other people have died in protests by uppercaste 
hindus over singhs affirmative action program to reserve more 
government jobs for lower castes more than half were students and 
teenagers who committed suicide blaming singhs policy for their 
action 
the president said he offered congress the largest party in 
parliament first option to form a government congress declined 
but said it would give unconditional support to chandra 
shekhar the statement said 
he then proposed the task to the hindu rightwing bharataya 
janata party the next largest group and the left front an 
alliance of communist and socialist parties before turning to 
chandra shekhar 
as prime minister chandra shekhar would preside over the 
smallest government india has ever had his dissident faction of 
singhs janata dal party had only 56 votes in parliament when the 
government lost a vote of confidence on wednesday 
chandra shekhars group which broke away from the janata dal 
party earlier in the week has claimed the support of 280 members 
in the 522seat decisionmaking lower house of parliament 
gandhis congress party has 195 seats and its smallparty 
allies have another 15 
critics have argued that the arrangement leaves the new 
government vulnerable to congress which could withdraw its support 
as soon as it feels ready to face elections 
singhs janata dal formed the government after the november 1989 
general elections when it prevented gandhis party from winning a 
majority 
the 11monthold government was reduced to a minority after the 
bharatiya janata party angered by his blocking of the hindu 
campaign over the disputed mosque withdrew support chandra 
shekhars defection dealt the government its death blow

a broadcast union at odds with nbc claims that 
nbc news is trying to get rid of some older staffers by putting 
them in a common labor pool described as professional exile 
the network denied it 
these people all have jobs and theyre not going away don 
browne nbcs executive news director said of about 35 nbc news 
writers and producers who will be taken from specific programs and 
put in the pool for use as needed 
the move was done as a costcutting measure with the executive 
producers of shows like today and nbc nightly news deciding 
which members of their staff would be shifted to the labor pool 
john clark president of the new york local of the national 
association of broadcast employees and technicians said thursday 
that 12 of 21 nabet members affected are age 50 or over and we 
think these are people the company would like to get rid of 
he characterized the pool as professional exile for those 
sent there 
browne denied that and other allegations by clark including his 
claim that nbc is apparently retaliating against nabet members who 
sued the network for overtime pay by also putting them in the labor 
pool 
browne said pool members would be put on duty with programs or 
work in nbc news bureaus as requirements dictated these people 
are going to be very active he said 
clark whose 900member local is nabets largest said the union 
will add a claim of age discrimination to a unfair labor practices 
complaint it has filed against nbc with the national labor 
relations board 
no action has been taken yet on the complaint which was filed 
after nbc in august put into effect a new threeyear contract that 
a majority of the unions 2300 members at nbc previously had 
rejected 
three years ago nabet struck nbc in a bitter walkout that 
lasted 17 weeks no strike vote has been called this time so far 
although no new negotiations are planned clark said

bar patrons couldnt pin him down 
but the long arm of the law finally wrestled ceasar the bear to the 
mat 
caesar a north american black bear that has wrestled patrons of 
midwest bars and nightclubs for the past six years was held 
thursday in his air conditioned trailer behind the gazander 
restaurant amp lounge 
police in this southwest chicago suburb warned bar proprieter 
steve sineni and bear owner sam mazzola they would be arrested if 
caesar wrestled again at the lounge they cited two city ordinances 
that carry 500 fines each and a state health law 
sineni said he would seek a court order today allowing the bear 
back into action 
eight patrons paid 10 apiece on oct 22 and 29 to get on the 
mat with caesar hoping to win 1000 promised to anyone who pinned 
the 7foot 6inch 970 pound bear 
no one did 
animal rights activists also picketed the bar but assistant 
manager dominic roti said caesar was treated well 
roti at 5foot11 and 217 pounds challenged caesar and lost 
for the first couple of minutes you make friends with the 
bear then he knocks you down and puts his paw on top of you 
roti said 
that was enough for police chief george dulzo who said he had 
no intention of taking caesar into custody 
we wont drag the bear off stage dulzo said ive seen 
the bear hes bigger than me probably smarter too

a federal judge barred the cable news network from 
broadcasting manuel noriegas taped conversations with his lawyers 
saying the ousted panama dictators right to a fair trial on drug 
charges is in jeopardy 
defense attorney frank rubino said he would demand that the case 
against noriega be dismissed 
we are absolutely shocked and horrified that the united states 
government would wiretap general noriega and his lawyers engaging 
in the most sensitive of communications rubino said 
but justice department officials said the taping was routine 
and that noriega had known his calls would be monitored a federal 
prison spokesman said it was up to noriega to inform officials that 
he was talking with his attorneys so they would stop the recording 
us district judge william hoeveler on thursday told cnn it 
couldnt broadcast the tapes made by prison officials and 
demanded an investigation into how the network got them he also 
ordered the taping stopped 
attorney general richard thornburgh in tampa on thursday said 
us officials want to find out how the tapes were leaked to cnn 
it concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was 
made of these tapes he said 
cnn accused the judge of exercising unconstitutional prior 
restraint and demanded an immediate hearing on the issue from the 
11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta no hearing was 
immediately scheduled by the appeals court but hoeveler scheduled 
another hearing in his court for late this afternoon 
meantime he told the news station not to broadcast at least 
through today any tapes that would interfere with attorneyclient 
privilege rights 
because of our belief the order is unconstitutional we will 
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the 
courts said cnn president tom johnson 
hoeveler said he had to weigh noriegas right to a fair trial 
against cnns right to freedom of the press 
its becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure 
that both parties get a fair trial he said 
us justice department officials said the taping was routine 
and produced a document in english and spanish that noriega signed 
acknowledging that his phone conversations would be monitored 
rubino complained that the taping of noriegas conversations 
violated his clients right to private meetings with his attorneys 
and jeopardized his case because the us government now knows his 
defense strategy 
us bureau of prisons spokesman gregory l bogdan in washington 
said prisoners are supposed to inform guards when they are talking 
to their attorneys so the monitoring can be stopped 
federal prosecutors told hoeveler they havent heard the tapes 
rubino was skeptical 
and i believe in santa claus the easter bunny and the tooth 
fairy he said 
the taping flap is the latest threatening to delay or derail 
noriegas trial on charges he accepted 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling 
operations through his country 
the us government has earmarked 6 million of 20 million in 
frozen noriega assets for payment of his attorneys but last month 
panama filed a lawsuit accusing noriega of looting its treasury and 
said it would seek to have those assets frozen noriegas defense 
teams says it needs the money to put together his defense before 
the case can go to trial 
the trial is scheduled to begin early next year but both sides 
agree it will probably be delayed 
panamanian president guillermo endara said thursday that if the 
united states does not go through with the trial panama wants 
noriega returned to face charges there 
in the case that the north americans cant do it were going 
to ask for him and he will be judged in accord with panamanian 
law because he committed many many crimes he said

on second viewing six degrees of separation 
reconfirms its status as the most imaginative play of the year 
john guares scathing savagely funny tale of new york chic 
officially reopened thursday after moving from a small theater in 
lincoln center to the much larger vivian beaumont 
the move makes the play eligible for tony award nominations next 
may they could give the prize right now there probably wont be a 
better new play all season 
guares play which originally opened last june resonates on 
many levels social satire rapidfire farce intellectual 
funhouse tragic pop fable and just plain good story to name a 
few 
the plot based on a reallife incident concerns a young black 
man who claims to be the son of actor sidney poitier and how he 
bamboozles all these rich supposedly sophisticated new yorkers 
along the way guare manages to skewer everything from cats 
to overpriced italian restaurants to race relations the author of 
the house of blue leaves has an ear for the way presentday new 
yorkers talk and think 
and jerry zaks directs in slambang style never allowing the 
play to careen out of control 
the bigger theater hasnt lessened the productions impact what 
has oddly enough is the casting of courtney b vance in the 
pivotal role of paul the young black man who disrupts the lives of 
these upper east side trendies vance is a fine actor but he lacks 
the magnetism that james mcdaniel brought to the role last summer 
mcdaniel who left the show to appear in the television series 
cop rock had a sinuous charm a quality that could be 
ingratiating and unnerving at the same time that appeal is missing 
from vances stiff portrayal of the hustler who makes fools out of 
these members of the upper crust 
the rest of the cast was and still is just about perfect 
stockard channing manages to make the plays bewildered heroine 
both funny and poignant she wants to believe pauls tall tale 
celebrating his imagination while forgetting his lie and john 
cunningham acts and looks picture perfect as the wasp art dealer 
not above a little finagling to make some big bucks 
the large supporting cast is just fine and there are several 
standout cameos peter maloney a mournful parent who doesnt want 
to know what his child is doing evan handler as a vindictive rich 
kid and robert duncan mcneil as the country bumpkin destroyed by 
pauls deceptions 
six degrees of separation is one of those rare plays that 
deserves a second look 
frank rich reviewing the play in fridays new york times said 
he found it as funny and moving and provocative as ever still a 
fresh experience not last seasons calcified hit

teacher layoffs and 1000 more jobs lost through attrition other

police believe leftist radicals opposed to emperor 
akihitos coronation set a fire today that razed a building on the 
grounds of one of japans most important buddhist temples 
the hachibuindo hall of enryakuji temple was found ablaze just 
after midnight by a temple guard said a police official in otsu 
230 miles west of tokyo 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said wires 
and eight charred batteries were found at the site of the fire a 
common indication of arson no one was injured 
we believe the fire may have been set by an ultraleftist 
group and are conducting an investigation with that in mind he 
said 
radical groups opposed to emperor akihitos coronation on monday 
have claimed responsibility for setting fires at several shinto 
shrines over the past month and are suspected of arson attacks on 
three this week alone 
the kakurokyo or revolutionary workers association on 
wednesday also claimed responsibility for blasts at a police 
dormitory that killed one officer and injured six other people on 
nov 1 
shinto japans indigenous religion is deeply tied to the 
monarchy and enryakuji is the head temple of the tendai sect of 
buddhism which has been closely associated with japans nobility 
throughout its history 
enryakuji priests began a special prayer service to mark 
akihitos formal enthronement this afternoon a temple employee 
said he said the prayers will continue until next month 
the employee who also requested that he not be named said the 
temple had not received any threatening phone calls from radicals 
enryakuji temple recognized as one of the most venerable of 
japans holy places was originally built in 788 the hall that was 
destroyed in todays fire had just been rebuilt two years ago

saudi arabia egypt and other arab forces would 
fight alongside us troops to liberate kuwait from iraq a senior 
us official said today near the end of a trip by secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
however the official said he was not sure whether france would 
go along baker will meet with french president francois mitterrand 
and foreign minister roland dumas in paris on saturday 
i dont know where the french would be said the official 
who briefed reporters under rules of anonymity baker left today 
for london 
as to the soviets they are not optimistic and indeed after 
having sent two diplomatic missions of their own to baghdad i 
think its fair to say that they are disappointed in the lack of a 
response thats been received baker said today 
theyre disappointed in the adamant attitude of saddam hussein 
in refusing to comply with 10 united nations resolutions i think 
they are as disappointed and as frustrated as most of the rest of 
the world community he said on abcs good morning america 
referring to yevgeny primakov a soviet mideast expert who has 
been dispatched twice to baghdad by president mikhail s gorbachev 
the senior official told reporters they sent an emissary and he 
was stiffed 
until now the soviets had hailed primakovs trips as productive 
and said they had given leaders cause for optimism over the last 
several weeks the soviets have raised hopes that a political 
solution could avert military action in the persian gulf region 
but on thursday for the first time publicly they gave their 
approval of the use of military force to get iraq out of kuwait if 
peaceful pressure tactics fail 
baker has talked about a military option at every stop during 
his travels to bahrain saudi arabia egypt turkey and the soviet 
union soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze during a 
news conference with baker thursday made no mention of military 
action until he was pressed by reporters 
whether or not the use of force could be ruled out probably 
this could not be ruled out and a situation may emerge which 
effectively would require such a move shevardnadze said then 
the official said saudi officials during meetings last week were 
absolutely committed to fighting alongside us troops 
theres no doubt in my mind saudi forces would be committed he 
said 
egyptians ousted kuwaitis and other arab forces in the gulf 
region also would join with the united states the official said 
however syria was a puzzler the official said he was not sure 
what syria would do although they might lead the charge 
against iraq 
the united states had enlisted syria in its makeshift alliance 
despite us allegations that the damascus government has supported 
terrorism 
syrian president hafez assad and saddam lead rival factions of 
the baath party and are bitter enemies saddam already has linked 
syrias military presence in lebanon to iraqs withdrawal from 
kuwait 
baker came to moscow on wednesday seeking at least soviet 
acquiescence if the bush administration presented a resolution to 
the united nations security council to authorize the use of force 
as a last resort to liberate kuwait 
but the official said baker had not asked gorbachev or foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze during their talks to support such a 
resolution 
we havent even authorized the drafting of a resolution the 
official added 
we think that a specific resolution of the security council 
that leaves no doubt about that option of force would be 
preferable from a political standpoint baker said today on nbcs 
today show 
thats not to say its required its not a precondition 
baker said 
foreign minister qian qichen of china one of five security 
council members who could veto the resolution told baker tuesday 
in cairo that beijing would not block such a resolution 
meanwhile today baker acknowledged that a major arms control 
agreement due for signing in 10 days at a paris summit still was 
not finished 
besides some technical issues he said neither side had 
approved methods of verifying weapons reductions or paying the cost 
of inspections 
the treaty is the intended showcase of a 34nation summit 
meeting in paris that president bush is due to attend nov 1921 
it would be the most comprehensive arms control accord in history 
encompassing europe from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
in the soviet union 
near the conclusion of bakers 13 hours of talks on thursday in 
moscow the two sides managed to reach an agreement in principle on 
deployment of tanks antiaircraft artillery and other nonnuclear 
arms in four european zones 
the arrangement needs the approval of turkey and norway baker 
sent ronald lehman director of the us arms control agency to 
oslo norway and stephen hadley of the us national security 
council to ankara turkey to consult with government leaders in 
those capitals 
hanging in the balance also is another accord to cut us and 
soviet longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by 30 
percent shevardnadze said there were some difficult problems 
with that pact which bush had hoped to sign at another summit 
meeting this winter in moscow 
the outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues 
including how much leeway the soviets would have to keep testing 
their ss18 intercontinental ballistic missiles

pawnshops are increasingly becoming home to the 
gold that made the 1980s glitter as layoffs wrack wall street and 
other industries 
but after years of being rudely portrayed by hollywood as a 
usurious business preying on the impoverished the pawnbroking 
industry is loath to be seen as a leading recessionary indicator 
lincoln square pawnbrokers is an example of the boom newly 
hardpressed new yorkers have contributed to a 10 percent jump in 
unreclaimed valuables hocked this year at the tiny pawnshop 
this is the largest increase in 15 years said owner gary 
kalter he said gold jewelry is his most frequently pawned item 
kalter is not alone in reaping a windfall from the weak us 
economy many of the roughly 8000 us pawnbrokers report that 
whitecollar professionals who just a few years ago wouldnt be 
caught dead near their shops are skulking in to hock their rolex 
watches diamond rings and other symbols of the fastcash 80s 
many of these former highfliers including lawyers developers 
and real estate agents need cash to buy christmas gifts or other 
luxury items but have exceeded their credit card limits 
typical of those doing a robust business is the 150store cash 
america investments inc which went public in 1987 and has grown 
25 percent in each of the past five years 
our stores look like little kmarts well lit and 
departmentalized said eugene estep vice president and director 
of investor relations at the fort worth texasbased chain 
nevertheless the pawnbroking industry would rather not 
publicize its boon from hard times and many brokers deny they are 
benefiting from the slump our business is good in good times and 
bad and thats the reason weve been around for 2000 years 
estep said 
our industry has had a pr problem said louise seawright 
president of fort lauderdale flabased national pawnbrokers 
association everyone watches tv and the media does have a way of 
dictating a lot of the publics thinking 
mindful of its image the trade organization in new york state 
recently changed its name from the pawnbrokers association to the 
collateral loan brokers association of new york 
and while business is booming across the nation times are 
decidedly mixed in new york city tough state regulations and high 
rents have helped reduce the number of pawnshops from 120 in 1940 
to 20 in 1980 to just 15 in 1990 
the remaining shops have been left to split up new yorks 
bustling customer base so stores now generally do a highvolume 
but lowrevenue business 
squeezed between a peepshow store and a pizza hut sampg gross 
co in midtown manhattan writes about 100 loans a day or about 
25000 a year about the same as a small bank branch 
a loyal customer base has helped the fourgeneration business 
remain in the hands of robert gross 71 and his son gary 46 
sampgs past is written both inside and out of the shop 
on the sooty store front three golden metal balls the ancient 
symbol for pawnbroking hang below a twosided neon sign 
loans 
inside on the wall of a narrow cluttered office is a 
turnofthecentury photo of a gaslit banquet at the old savoy 
hotel members of the state trade group about 200 tuxedoed 
pawnbrokers at five long tables pose for the camera seated in 
plush leather chairs 
among the men are roberts father sol then 30 and roberts 
grandfather a burly man in his 50s with a teddy rooseveltstyle 
mustache and a confident visage 
these days a less staid bunch a dozen or so pawnbrokers 
representing a dramatically smaller industry meet under more 
modest circumstances at less posh manhattan restaurants 
tapping the shops new 40000 computer system gary notes that 
keeping track of customers loans has cut down on some of the 
haggling 
in another sign of changing times the store several years ago 
limited itself to selling jewelry and it no longer deals in 
household items customers could buy cheaper in department stores 
you could see that advancements in electronics were making 
items obsolete gary said i said to myself myself this is 
10 percent of the business and 90 percent of the aggravation

tainted eye drops specially prepared by a 
pharmacist caused a severe infection that cost one woman an eye and 
similar infections in at least a dozen other people doctors say 
after the woman whose eye had to be removed came in for 
treatment this week surgeons at allegheny general hospital 
discovered the drops were contaminated by a tenacious bacteria 
called pseudomonas dr john kennerdell chairman of the hospitals 
ophthalmology department said thursday 
normally we dont find any bacteria in medication but with 
that specimen we found over 100 colonies said matthew rigg a 
hospital lab technician we couldnt believe how strong it was 
the prescription eye drops prepared at hiebers drug store by 
pharmacist and owner joseph kilkeary were designed to ease 
inflammation after cataract surgery 
ive been selling these drops for years without a problem 
kilkeary said 
he said 20 to 25 customers bought the drops in october they 
have been told to quit using them and return them to the pharmacy 
or their doctors 
thirteen people were hospitalized for treatment in pittsburgh 
doctors said one man who used the drops but shows no sign of 
infection was under observation 
doctors removed the womans right eye last week after 
antibiotics failed the other 12 are receiving large doses of 
antibiotics two have impaired vision and could lose an eye 
kennerdell said 
once this type of bacteria gains access to the inside of the 
eye it causes a very devastating infection he said thats why 
its so dangerous 
the drops contain a liquid solution and indocin an 
antiinflammatory drug normally taken orally for arthritis 
pharmacists commonly mix solutions not offered by drug companies 
when doctors prescribe them said harvey miller a food and drug 
administration spokesman in philadelphia 
the practice is legal but the fda will investigate the tainted 
eye drop case he said 
gary bruell a spokesman for merck sharp amp dohme the maker of 
indocin said we really cant comment on what physicians or 
pharmacists may be doing with the product outside its current 
labeling he said 
kilkeary said he didnt know how the bottles became tainted lab 
tests on bottles in the store found no contamination he said

the second bomb fell within the clearly defined security 
area the red cross said the roofs and windows of four 
hospital buildings were also blown off due to the bomb 
explosions

women candidates proved this week that they 
can raise millions play political hardball and win the big ones 
feminist fundraisers and analysts say 
were no longer the notreadyforprimetime players said 
jane danowitz executive director of the bipartisan womens 
campaign fund 
the good old boys better watch out said sharon rodine 
president of the national womens political caucus also a 
bipartisan group this is the start of something very big 
start is the operative word 
though democrat ann richards weighed in with a breakthrough 
gubernatorial win in highstakes texas the numbers of women at the 
highest levels of government are the same or lower than before 
tuesdays elections three governors two senators and 28 house 
members down from 29 
but rodine said lowerlevel gains put women in position to 
exploit dozens of open congressional seats expected to arise in 
1992 as a result of redistricting and a lastchance opportunity 
that year for retiring members to take their campaign war chests 
with them 
among the statistics compiled by rutgers universitys center for 
the american woman and politics 
a record 85 women ran for statewide elective executive offices 
and 47 won combined with 10 holdovers women now hold 17 percent 
of these offices 
a record 2063 women sought state legislative seats 210 more 
than in 1988 the largest increase in recent elections the 
percentage of women state legislators is expected to rise about one 
percentage point to 18 percent 
the big story is not the numberscrunching or just looking at 
capitol hill rodine said its the new pool of women who 
jumped in at the state and local level 
the feminist analysts cited exit poll findings that in many 
races women candidates attracted most of womens votes they 
attributed the gender gap largely to abortion and to a lesser 
extent kitchen table issues such as education drugs and jobs 
womens votes elected ann richards and probably other women 
said ruth mandel director of the rutgers center 
if women had been the only voters in california and north 
carolina dianne feinstein would be packing up to move to 
sacramento and harvey gantt would be on his way to washington 
mandel added referring to the losing democratic candidates for 
california governor and north carolina senator 
danowitz said the elections shattered a number of myths she 
said the hardfought mudslinging richards race disproved ideas 
that women cant win the big races cant raise big money cant 
take the heat of political battle and cant attract the votes of 
other women 
in addition danowitz said the weeks elections raised the 
number of female state attorneys general from one to four 
dispelling the notion that women are weak on crime 
the election also boosted from 15 to 22 the number of women 
holding state treasurer auditor or comptroller posts according to 
the campaign funds count voters entrusted their pocketbooks to 
women dissolving the myth that women are weak fiscal managers 
danowitz said 
three republican women who quit the house to challenge 
democratic senators won praise from the feminists although they all 
lost badly 
these women took a risk and should be applauded were going 
to have to go after incumbents said rodine 
mandel said their risks were not in vain i dont think there 
are any automatic sacrificial lambs anymore even if they dont 
make it this time they have advanced themselves in some way she 
said 
ellen malcolm founder of the democratic fundraising group 
emilys list noted that despite the static overall number of women 
in congress democrats have made substantial gains 
in 1972 she said there were 14 democratic women in the house 
and in 1986 there were 12 we were losing ground we have turned 
that around we now have 20 thats a twothirds increase 
malcolm said 
in 1992 she predicted with the large number of open seats 
youre going to see that line go straight up

parliament voted today to delay 
considering a churchsupported bill that would outlaw abortions 
which have been legal in poland since 1956 and jail doctors who 
perform them 
the sejm or lower house voted not to take up a draft bill 
banning abortion that was passed by the senate on sept 29 
instead a motion was passed to put off the discussion until 
after presidential elections on nov 25 a possible runoff is 
scheduled for dec 9 
opponents of the abortion ban fear it will pass if it comes to a 
direct vote so they are trying to delay debate during the current 
parliament term which should end early next year 
calling for immediate consideration was marek jurek of the 
citizens parliamentary club the caucus of deputies elected with 
the backing of solidarity he said the abortion bill has nothing to 
do with the presidential elections and that postponing it would be 
perceived as footdragging 
after the motion proposed by 17 deputies to consider the bill 
today was defeated the sejm voted 14093 with 49 abstentions to 
delay debate until after the elections 
the two main presidential candidates solidarity leader lech 
walesa and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki say they accept 
church teachings and so support the legislation the only candidate 
opposing the legislation is leftist wlodzimierz cimoszewicz 
legalized abortion was introduced by the countrys former 
communist rulers in 1956 without a public debate 
although more than 90 percent of polands population is 
catholic 800000 abortions are performed annually terminating an 
estimated one in two pregnancies other forms of birth control are 
not widely available 
the bill would impose no criminal penalties for women who 
undergo abortions but doctors could be sentenced to three years in 
prison 
the bill provides for abortions only when a womans life is 
threatened or the pregnancy is a result of a rape or incest

roman catholic archbishop roger m mahony 
offered qualified support to us actions in the middle east but 
urged the government to consider the moral ramifications before 
resorting to force 
in a letter to secretary of state james a baker iii mahony 
urged the bush administration in continued cooperation with the 
united nations the soviet union arab states and other nations 
to stay the course of persistent peaceful and determined 
pressure against iraq 
the los angeles archbishop wrote baker on wednesday as chairman 
of the international policy committee of the us catholic 
conference the letter was released thursday 
mahony said the nations 390 roman catholic bishops spiritual 
leaders of 55 million catholics support un economic sanctions 
against iraq and condemn iraqi aggression and the taking of 
hostages after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
but ethical considerations should not be ignored or neglected 
in a focus on simple military and geopolitical considerations 
mahony said 
is the damage to be inflicted and the costs incurred by war 
proportionate to the objectives to be achieved by taking up arms 
he wrote will war with iraq leave the people of kuwait the 
middle east and the world better or worse off 
we understand that a strong military presence can give 
credibility to a vigorous pursuit of nonviolent solutions to the 
crisis he said but he added that he was concerned that the 
pressure to use military force may grow as efforts to pursue 
nonviolent options almost inevitably become difficult complex 
and slow 
as catholic bishops we are deeply concerned about the human 
consequences of the crisis the lives already lost or those that 
could be lost in a war the freedom denied to hostages the victims 
of aggression and the many families divided by the demands of 
military service he said 
in september mahony wrote the administration requesting that 
the trade embargo against iraq not include essential food and 
medicine for civilians 
in the letter released thursday the archbishop cited socalled 
just war criteria outlined in the us bishops pastoral letter 
on war and peace released in may 1983 
that letter emphasizes that catholic tradition does not rule out 
the use of force absolutely but it does make a clear presumption 
against war us policymakers should consider whether their goals 
justify the use of force mahony said 
archbishop daniel pilarczyk of cincinnati president of the 
national conference of catholic bishops has said he was praying 
for a peaceful solution so that the soldiers sailors and air men 
of all forces now arrayed in the region may soon be restored to 
their families

in late october president saddam hussein freed french 
nationals saying france was trying in good faith to find a 
solution to the 3monthold gulf crisis some said it was a move to 
divide the world alliance against iraq

leaders including edward heath of britain yasuhiro nakasone of 
japan and willy brandt of germany to free western captives all 
have met with some success 
their governments however have denied that any deals were 
struck in exchange for the release of hostages the former

moslem guerrilla bases north of israels security zone in 
southern lebanon after officials guaranteed the safety of 
christians living nearby 
the army said tanks paratroopers and infantry units moved 
against strongholds near the towns of jaba kfar milki and mazraat 
ayn abu siwar 
the statement said the areas were used by hezbollah militia to 
launch attacks against israeli troops and the south lebanon army 
militia which is trained and financed by israel 
the bases were damaged and there were no israeli casualties 
according to the army it gave no information about possible 
hezbollah casualties 
the attacks occurred five to eight miles west of jezzine a 
largely christian town 12 miles from the northern tip of the 
security zone which was created by israel in 1985 after it 
withdrew most of its troops from lebanon 
although jezzine is patrolled by the israelibacked south 
lebanon army militia fears have arisen recently that the lebanese 
governments plan to rid beirut of moslem militias could push them 
southward and threaten the town 
on a visit to south lebanon on thursday defense minister moshe 
arens promised that the israeli army will do whatever is necessary 
to protect jezzine army radio said 
we will do what is needed in order to ensure that the control 
over these areas is not harmed arens was quoted as saying he 
did not elaborate 
danny neveh an aide to arens said today the defense minister 
was trying to make it clear what israels security concerns are 
given the possible changes in beirut 
israels main interest is the security of its northern 
border neveh said this means we are not going to allow 
anything that may threaten our interest in security zone and in the 
jezzine area 
he declined to say whether this meant israel was willing to 
commit troops if jezzine were threatened 
neveh also said there was no move to expand the security zone to 
include jezzine 
arens who was accompanied lt gen dan shomron the armys 
chief of staff made the promise to the sla commander gen antoine 
lahad the radio said 
lahad was quoted in thursdays yedioth ahronoth newspaper as 
saying he would fight to keep other militias out of jezzine 
in the present situation where there is no state of lebanon 
i will refuse any entry of lebanese forces into jezzine lahad 
said 
the al hamishmar and hadashot newspapers quoted senior israeli 
army officers as saying israel now considers jezzine a red line 
not to be passed by lebanese or syrian forces 
they were quoted as saying israel was changing the map of 
the security zone israel however has announced no official 
extension of its zone 
lahad has long wanted jezzine incorporated into the security 
zone and recently told israeli correspondents that the town was 
an inseparable part of the zone 
hadashot reported that lahad was sending his best troops to 
protect jezzine

a dallas county judge dismissed eight misdemeanor 
obscenity charges againt a music store chain in an agreement with 
prosecutors under which the chain will stop selling an album by rap 
group 2 live crew 
sound warehouse inc will stop selling the album as nasty as 
they wanna be said gerald h goldstein an attorney for the 
chain the album was deemed obscene by a federal judge in florida 
dallas county criminal court judge george shepherd said he 
dropped the charges thursday at the request of prosecutors 
assistant district attorney david pickett got statewide news 
coverage when he announced at a july news conference that his 
office would file charges against sound warehouse for distributing

the dutch reformed church joined 
other christian denominations today in rejecting apartheid as a sin 
and confessed the churchs role in implementing the system of 
legalized segregation 
the dutch reformed church the main church of the 
dutchdescended afrikaners who control the government had argued 
for decades that the bible supported apartheid that position 
isolated it from other denominations 
but at the end of a weeklong conference of 90 christian 
churches leaders of the dutch reformed church joined in supporting 
a statement condemning church participation in apartheid 
we confess our own sin and acknowledge our heretical part in 
the policy of apartheid which has led to such extreme suffering 
the joint statement said we denounce apartheid in its intention 
its implementation and its consequences as an evil policy 
the conference in rustenburg 60 miles northwest of 
johannesburg was the largest ever gathering of christian churches 
in south africa 
the socalled rustenburg document also recommended that the 
government remove all apartheid laws set up a oneperson onevote 
democracy seek equitable wealth distribution restore land to 
blacks and arrange an affirmative action program to advance 
blacks 
rev peter potgieter head of the dutch reformed church said 
his church agreed with the basic message of the document but not 
with some of the details he declined to be more specific but it 
appeared his reservations were with the specific political 
recommendations in the document 
he cautioned that the document was not official church policy 
which must be decided by the churchs synod 
nonetheless the churchs participation in the conference and 
its general support for the final document was its strongest 
repudiation of apartheid to date the church first said apartheid 
was wrong several years ago but had not declared it a sin or 
confessed its role in building the system 
the rev frank chikane leader of the south african council of 
churches praised the document but said he understood the dutch 
reformed churchs hesitation to give it full support 
i feel that we have started a process and im just hoping the 
dutch reformed church will be able to move ahead with us he 
said i understand theyre constrained they have to answer back 
to their own membership 
the rustenburg document did not cite the dutch reformed church 
by name it said all south african churches should have done more 
to resist apartheid 
some of us actively misused the bible to justify apartheid 
leading many to believe that it had the sanction of god it said 
other churches the document said ignored apartheid by 
preaching the sufficiency of individual salvation without social 
transformation 
we adopted an allegedly neutral stance which in fact resulted 
in complicity with apartheid it said 
still other churches condemned apartheid but did little to 
resist the statement said 
virtually all south africas leading clergymen attended the 
conference including anglican archbishop desmond tutu and 
chikane 
tutu who won the nobel peace prize in 1984 for his opposition 
to apartheid said he accepted the repentance the confession is 
not cheaply made and my response is not cheaply made he said 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church has about 1 
million members including president fw de klerk and most of the 
cabinet 
there are separate branches for blacks and people of mixedrace 
which have staunchly opposed apartheid 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church said last month it 
wants to merge with its sister churches but no action has been 
taken 
de klerk has promised to dismantle apartheid and negotiate a new 
constitution that will allow the 5 million whites and 30 million 
blacks to share power

to build the waste dump the protests began peacefully earlier this 
week after publication of a newspaper report about the governments 
plans for the dump

to build more previous protests have involved minor clashes or 
peaceful rallies

the opposition labor partys easy victory in two 
special parliamentary elections is prompting renewed speculation of 
an imminent challenge to prime minister margaret thatchers 
leadership of the conservative party 
in the most humiliating result from thursdays voting the 
conservatives slumped to third place behind the centrist liberal 
democrats in bradford north a district the conservatives had 
controlled in the early 1980s 
laborite terry rooney 39 won by 52 percent of the vote to hold 
bradford north with 9514vote majority up from a slim 1663vote 
margin in britains 1987 general election 
in the northwest england dockland town of bootle a socialist 
stronghold labors joe benton gathered 22052 votes some nine 
times as many as the secondplaced conservatives 2587 
the elections caused by the deaths of the previous legislators 
in the two districts were the first since mrs thatchers deputy 
sir geoffrey howe quit last week 
howe resigned in protest of mrs thatchers resistance to a 
drive for closer union of the european community 
i think out there were not very popular at the moment 
conservative party chairman kenneth baker said of the result of 
thursdays ballot in bradford north 
baker blamed continuing high interest rates as the government 
pursues a long struggle to bring down britains 109 percent 
inflation rate and the upheaval over howes resignation 
he maintained the party did not want or need a leadership 
election 
but conservative legislator tony marlow said pressure would 
increase pressure for a challenge to mrs thatcher at the annual 
leadership election this month 
i think there will be a new prime minister before christmas 
marlow said 
he is the most outspoken among rankandfile conservative 
legislators fearful of losing their seats at the next election 
which must be held by mid1992 
the leadership election in which conservative legislators vote 
is scheduled for nov 20 
apart from a feeble challenge last year mrs thatcher has been 
reelected annually as the sole nominee since she became party 
leader in 1975 
thatcher loyalists joined baker in trying to quench the 
speculation 
we are worried of course that we may not win the next 
election said legislator ivor lawrence but we are not worried 
that we must look for somebody to replace mrs thatcher 
in bradford north the tory vote crumbled in a huge 23 percent 
swing against the government the tories got 6048 votes well 
behind the liberal democrats 9105 
in national opinion polls the conservatives are trailing 
between 12 and 20 points behind labor 
mrs thatcher still has solid control of the 650member house of 
commons the conservatives have 373 seats labor 227 and the 
liberal democrats 20 other seats are held by minority regional 
parties

striking daily news workers are ready to take 
the same pay cuts that their colleagues at the post accepted two 
months ago the newspaper unions leader announced 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades 
council made the announcement thursday after news publisher james 
hoge said that union negotiators had offered only small concessions 
during the 10 months of negotiations that preceded the strike 
mcdonald head of the 10union coalition of workers at both the 
news and the post responded go back and say to hoge that 
mcdonald said at a press conference well match what we gave the 
post 
news spokeswoman lisa robinson said that mcdonald should 
learn that the place for negotiations is at the bargaining table 
not at a news conference 
in september nine of the 10 unions agreed to nearly 20 million 
in wage cuts at the post after publisher peter kalikow said the 
only alternative was to close the paper many employees agreed to a 
20 percent pay cut by switching to a fourday work week 
mcdonald said of the post they came to us very honestly and 
said look weve lost some 29 million this year well show it 
to you we saw their books we believed them 
now the same people who are members of our unions would do the 
same thing at the daily news if they had the opportunity 
mcdonald said do you think they like to be out on strike 
the news strike began oct 25 with a dispute at the papers 
brooklyn plant some deliverers walked off the job the news 
responded by bringing in replacement workers 
the walkout spread to eight of nine other unions at the paper 
the unions representing 2100 workers had been working without 
contracts since march 30 
finding a daily news in the city remained a challenge today as 
the strike against the tabloid entered day 16 with newsstand 
vendors saying the threat of union retribution has convinced them 
to shun the paper 
nobodys selling the daily news the unions they are coming 
every day and checking said shamini khan owner of a newsstand 
at 49th street and broadway i want to sell it but its risky 
im scared

manhattan and downtown brooklyn found dealers almost bereft of the 
paper hoge said wednesday that 600000 papers were being printed 
each day with twothirds of those finding their way to readers

martin luther king jr borrowed words and ideas 
extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and 
other writings without giving proper citations a stanford 
university historian says 
several of kings academic papers as well as his 
dissertation contain numerous appropriated passages that can be 
defined as plagiarism historian clayborne carson said in a story 
the wall street journal published today 
the slain civil rights leaders widow coretta scott king chose 
carson to lead the martin luther king jr papers project which she 
founded in 1984 to gather his papers from locations around the 
country and produce a multivolume collection 
mrs kings spokesman steve klein said today that she was 
aware of the newspaper story but had no immediate comment on it 
kings school papers are his most obscure and insignificant 
writings but the discoveries have prompted debate anguish and 
soulsearching among scholars who have worked on the project 
associate editor ralph luker a follower of king who was jailed 
during a civil rights protest said he suffered deep anxieties 
over the findings and many hours of lost sleep 
david garrow a member of the projects advisory board and 
author of bearing the cross a pulitzer prizewinning biography 
of king said the discovery had a tremendously shaking emotional 
impact on me 
to me 98 percent of what makes it most interesting is why 
did he do it was he so insecure that he thought this was the only 
way to get by its disconcerting because it is fundamentally 
phenomenally out of character with my entire sense of the man 
the questions about his academic work surfaced in late 1987 
nearly 20 years after his death when evidencewas discovered by a 
stanford graduate student who was working for the king papers 
project 
in some parts of the dissertation king wrote as a doctoral 
candidate at boston university he lifted passages nearly verbatim 
from other texts without using any quotation marks or footnotes 
the journal reported 
after that discovery carson told his staff to check the sources 
of nearly of all kings academic work 
it became apparent that throughout his seven years of graduate 
school kings essays especially in his major field of graduate 
study systematic theology often borrowed from other sources 
without citing them as required by academic policy the journal 
reported 
when the problem was found three project editors and a 
halfdozen student researchers worked for nearly two years 
annotating all of kings 150 or so academic papers 
carson said king likely did not intentionally do anything wrong 
by sometimes failing to attribute materials in his writing 
the best evidence for that he said is that he saved his 
papers and donated them to an archive at bu of all places

a toxic chemical has leaked into a river in 
byelorussia and latvia forcing the shutoff of drinking water to at 
least two cities and tainting the river for hundreds of miles 
officials said today 
the leak apparently came from the national governments chemical 
and petrochemical ministry which produces chemicals for military 
weapons said viktor yukhno the controller at latvias government 
water authority 
city and republic leaders said officials never informed them of 
the leak into the daugava river which occurred sometime between 
oct 31 and nov 5 
it is just the same as chernobyl we only learned that 
something went wrong when we saw fish floating belly up down the 
stream said latvian deputy prime minister ilmar bisher 
referring to the 1983 nuclear power plant disaster in the ukraine 
he said two men suffered minor poisoning after eating fish 
we hope there will be no more cases said bisher head of a 
latvian commission investigating the leak 
drinking water from the river to the latvian capital riga a 
city of nearly 1 million people was turned off thursday morning 
said yukhno 
the citys residents have been using water from underground 
wells but pumps are not powerful enough to bring water to taller 
buildings and many residents remain without water yukhno said the 
city gets about a third of its water from the river 
it is not known when rigas water supply from the river will be 
turned back on but bisher said it should take 10 days for all the 
contaminated water to flow out to sea and clean water to refill 
citys reservoir 
water also was cut to daugapils a city of 150000 about 120 
miles east of riga and crews have trucked in water for the city 
and other areas bisher said he said much of the contamination 
already has passed daugavpils and water may be turned back on by 
saturday he said 
the plant is located in the byelorussian town of novopolotsk 
480 miles upriver from riga and 880 miles west of moscow said 
yukhno 
the chemical was a component of cyanide yukhno said but 
officials were still testing it to determine exactly what kind 
there was no immediate word on how the leak occurred or if 
chemicals were still being spilled and no cleanup efforts were 
reported neither plant officials nor the official state press have 
commented on the incident 
this does not only affect riga but the whole republic 
said riga mayor andris inkulis in stockholm sweden where he was 
visiting we warned people over television and radio so they 
could save some water 
local officials were still testing the chemical and trying to 
determine how much had leaked inkulis said unofficial reports on 
the leakage range from three tons to up to 60 tons 
yukhno said it was impossible to determine how many people may 
be affected in latvia or byelorussia because many have begun using 
well water 
riga is the largest city on the river lying at its mouth on the 
baltic sea but hundreds possibly thousands of other people live 
in areas along the river and traditionally used the river for food 
and drinking water

germany today marked a year since the opening of 
the berlin wall a joyful anniversary interlocked with a bitter 
one the night in 1938 when breaking glass heralded the holocaust 
war and german partition 
officials of newly united germany also warmly welcomed mikhail 
s gorbachev who arrived in bonn today to a 27man military honor 
guard 
the soviet presidents visit is highly symbolic since his 
reforms helped collapse the iron curtain and open the berlin wall 
he was to sign a 20year germansoviet nonaggression treaty and 
was expected to receive financial aid for his nations troubled 
economy 
commemorations of the walls opening were to include the 
unveiling of a monument at one of the former crossing points 
between east and west berlin and a ceremony to honor the more than 
200 people killed trying to escape east germany 
at the same time germanys jewish community held memorial 
ceremonies on the 52nd anniversary of attacks on synagogues jewish 
homes and businesses known as kristallnacht crystal night 
because of all the glass shattered by nazi thugs 
by the time world war ii ended seven years later with germanys 
division 6 million jews had been killed many rounded up in full 
view of fellow germans and transported to death camps 
heinz galinski a jewish leader in germany said many germans 
have never accepted nov 9 as a day of commemoration though it 
led to the holocaust 
the mayors of west berlin and east berlin walter momper and 
tino schwierzina said in a joint statement thursday the two nov 9 
anniversaries should remind germans of the need to fight against 
oppression of minorities 
they called for the public to participate in national affairs as 
the best protection against against misuse of state power 
jochen feilcke a member of parliament from chancellor helmut 
kohls christian democrats party called completely erroneous 
statements from communists that former east german officials played 
a major role in opening the wall 
berliners streamed that night to the border crossings and took 
over the wall at the brandenburg gate he said 
last week a report in the newspaper of the former communist 
party neues deutschland said mediumlevel east german security 
officers decided to let the pressing crowds through the wall 
fearing border guards would be killed otherwise 
guenter schabowski a member of the then ruling east german 
communist politburo also said last year the east german government 
had intended to allow its citizens to travel abroad before the wall 
opened portions of a news conference by schabowski was planned to 
be broadcast over loudspeakers late today in the central square in 
east berlin 
the bundesrat the upper house of parliament was to mark the 
wall anniversary by holding its first meeting in berlin in 31 
years moving from bonn the federal capital 
the two germanys united oct 3 into a country of nearly 80 
million people by far the biggest in europe their leaders pledged 
repeatedly that the new germany will not seek to dominate the 
continent nor would it forget the nazi part of its history 
television news programs thursday ran long recapitulations of 
the celebrations that erupted at the brandenburg gate last nov 9 
when it became known that east germans were free to travel to the 
west 
one year ago massive prodemocracy demonstrations and the 
flight of refugees to the west prompted east germanys communist 
leaders to begin opening the berlin wall hundreds of people 
spontaneously climbed the 11foot wall that symbolized the 
divisions of germany and europe 
shedding tears of happiness some began using hammers and 
chisels on the concrete barrier soon a thriving business was 
started selling chips of the wall as souvenirs 
bulldozers have finished removing 81 percent of the wall from 
downtown berlin and have about two miles to go officials say 
elections in east germany early this year booted the communists 
from four decades of power leading to last months unification 
the first unified german parliamentary elections are dec 2 
the sweeping change however has been painful for many former 
east germans as the switch to capitalism has caused inefficient 
businesses to shut down causing rising unemployment

the man accused of assassinating rabbi meir 
kahane may have been taking an antidepressant drug that critics 
claim induces violent behavior according to a published report 
the new york times in todays editions quoted an unnamed law 
enforcement source as saying that the accused el sayyid nosair 
was taking prozac officer hugh barry a police spokesman said 
today he could not confirm the report 
several lawsuits are pending against the drugs manufacturer 
eli lilly amp co which has denied allegations that the drug can 
induce suicidal or homicidal behavior the food and drug 
administration also has found no link 
nosair 34 who has denied fatally shooting the radical rabbi in 
a manhattan hotel on monday night entered no plea at his 
arraignment in bellevue hospitals intensive care unit nosair was 
shot in the throat by a us postal service police officer after 
the incident 
in waterbury conn fbi agents new york city detectives and 
local police searched the home of a man they described as a friend 
of nosair no arrests were made thursday night neither the mans 
identity nor the address was disclosed 
the gunman had a connection in waterbury said waterbury 
chief of detectives john griffin he has a friend a moslem they 
both met in a mosque we searched the mans house i cant say if 
we found anything 
new york police have said they believe nosair acted alone but 
are not aware of his motive 
the 58yearold kahane was the americanborn rabbi who founded 
the antiarab kach party in israel and the militant jewish defense 
league in this country his killing monday night touched off 
antiarab riots in israel 
chief of detectives joseph borrelli said thursday that relatives 
told police they thought nosair had been under a doctors care 
barry said police believe he was being treated for depression 
nosair was on documented sick leave from his job with the citys 
department of general services five days last week said department 
spokesman john beckman the diagnosis was confidential beckman 
said 
borrelli speculated that nosair a native egyptian who has an 
engineering degree may have felt frustrated because he couldnt 
fulfill his potential in this country 
nosair began working for the general services in april 1988 
repairing heating and cooling systems in courthouses 
in addition nosair injured his hand or arm in an accident at 
work in which he was nearly electrocuted borrelli said 
the combined stress was acting on him he wasnt getting 
ahead borrelli theorized 
new york newsday quoted an unidentified source as saying that 
nosair threw a tantrum in a locker room monday because he was being 
transferred to brooklyn beckman confirmed that nosair was to be 
transferred from mahattan to brooklyn effective thursday but both 
he and borrelli said they had no evidence that nosair had a tantrum 
over it 
it wasnt punitive said beckman he was a satisfactory 
worker 
beckman said the department has 108 other employees who do the 
same job as nosair these guys take these jobs with the 
understanding they will be transferred of the 109 last year there 
were 61 transfers 
borrelli said police have found a car registered to nosair in 
new jersey parked a few blocks from the midtown hotel where kahane 
was murdered 
on wednesday the department of general services suspended him 
without pay until further notice based on his alleged criminal 
activity and because he allegedly used a false brooklyn address 
though his job has a new york city residency requirement nosair 
lives in cliffside park nj beckman said

king birendra whose grip on absolute 
power was shaken by a springtime prodemocracy uprising today 
enacted a constitution reducing his powers 
the new document establishes a constitutional monarchy and 
declares the himalayan nation a multiparty democracy 
it abolishes the old system under which political parties were 
banned and the king ruled with a nonpartisan legislature that 
routinely approved measures favored by the monarch 
i feel very much elated on such a historic occasion for which 
the people have been aspiring and have laid down their lives 
prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai told a news conference 
the draft of a proposed constitution was completed two months 
ago but enactment bogged down in a tugofwar between the palace 
and bhattarais fledging government over how much power the king 
should retain 
bhattarai said the king agreed to act in the same fashion as 
britains constitutional monarchy 
he said general elections will be held sometime between 
midapril and early may next year 
in a message broadcast live on national radio and television 
birendra said the new constitution will help to forge the people 
in a bond of unity and advance the cause of multiparty democracy in 
a constitutional monarchy 
he said the document takes effect immediately 
the adoption of the new constitution culminates a prodemocracy 
campaign that began in late winter with weeks of strikes and street 
demonstrations by doctors lawyers students and the longbanned 
political parties 
the turning point came on april 6 when police opened fire as 
200000 demonstrators marched to the royal palace at least 72 
people were killed according to official accounts witnesses put 
the death toll at more than 300 
shortly afterward the king caved in to pressure and asked 
bhattarai a top leader of the nepali congress party to form an 
interim government until elections could be held in the spring of 
1991 
the nepali congress party and all other political parties were 
banned by birendras father king mahendra when he ended an 
18month experiment with democracy in december 1960 
birendra was crowned king in 1972 when his father died he is 
the latest monarch in the 223yearold shah dynasty 
the new constitution declares nepal a hindu and constitutional 
monarchical kingdom the buddhist and christian minorities had 
sought to have nepal declared a secular state 
hindus comprise 90 percent of nepals 17 million people moslems 
make up 5 percent while christians comprise 3 percent most of the 
others are buddhists 
under the new constitution nepal will have a twohouse 
parliament consisting of a policymaking house of representatives 
and an upper house called the national council 
all 205 members of the house of representatives and 35 of the 45 
members of the national council will be elected the remaining 10 
members of the upper house will be appointed by the king

west virginia teachers who staged an 
11day wildcat strike this year won a major victory today when the 
state supreme court ruled a county judge had no right to order them 
back to work 
the five justices unanimously overruled kanawha county circuit 
judge john heys statewide backtowork order the opinion written 
by justice wt brotherton jr said hey had no jurisdiction to 
issue an order that would affect the rights of teachers outside 
kanawha county 
it said heys action was precluded by a 1981 state law 
were pleased with the decision and we feel the supreme court 
has certainly acted appropriately and that judge hey was out of 
line said kayetta meadows president of the west virginia 
education association 
teachers struck over low pay march 7 on march 16 hey issued an 
injunction telling the strikers to return to work statewide 
meadows and other educators filed a petition with the supreme 
court the same day asking it to annul heys order the teachers 
returned to work two days later 
after the teachers returned to work two days later the union 
asked the supreme court to dismiss their petition but the court 
decided to consider the issue the teachers raised 
although the present situation clearly results in a waste of 
judicial resources we do not believe that the circuit court of one 
county has the authority to enjoin the acts of citizens occurring 
in other counties except where the judge of the other county is 
interested in the proceeding and unable to act brotherton wrote 
in an unusual twist the court used the opinion to lecture both 
sides 
all parties to this strike must realize that ultimately our 
states plans for an economic renaissance depend upon our children 
and their ability to cope with the complex issues that will face 
them the opinion said 
unfortunately work stoppages which involve the public 
schools regardless of merit or length serve only to harm the 
children of this state brotherton wrote

no federal judge in the country could impartially 
hear the case of a man charged in mail bombings that killed a 
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer the mans lawyers say 
attorneys for walter leroy moody jr asked in a court motion 
thursday that the senate judiciary committee appoint two 
independent officers to hear the case 
that a federal judge was one of the victims damages the 
impartiality of all federal judges the lawyers argued in a hearing 
before us magistrate william harper 
moodys lawyers refused to enter a plea in the arraignment 
before harper rules on their motion a plea of innocent was 
automatically filed 
harper referred the case to us district judge richard freeman 
for trial no hearing was scheduled on the motion 
defense attorney bruce harvey said he believed the motion was 
the first of its kind anywhere 
the rationale behind the request is clear no federal judge 
can be impartial in a case involving the assassination of a 
colleague as a result of the performance of his official duties 
harvey said 
special assistant us attorney howard shapiro declined to 
comment 
the court motion did not indicate why the attorneys think two 
independent officers should be appointed and harvey declined to 
explain or give other details 
moody 56 was charged in a 70count indictment wednesday with 
making and sending a series of mail bombs that killed 11th us 
circuit court of appeals judge robert vance in alabama and attorney 
robert robinson in georgia 
moody faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and a 250000 
fine from a murder charge in the death of vance he faces the same 
sentence in robinsons death from a charge for transporting 
explosive material with intent to kill 
moody also is charged with a variety of other offenses related 
to the bombings 
if convicted on all 70 counts moody could face seven life terms 
plus 385 years in prison and fines of 169 million 
moody did not speak at the hearing he was returned to the 
atlanta federal penitentiary where he is being held on unrelated 
witness tampering charges 
harvey said courthouses across the country have had extra 
security put in place after vances killing and judges and their 
families have altered their lifestyles 
officials in alabama and georgia said they were considering 
whether to pursue separate state murder charges which can carry 
the death penalty against moody for the bomb slayings

the former denver developer who defaulted on 106 
million in loans from silverado savings and loan has filed for 
personal bankruptcy claiming 196 million in debts 
nathan jones an attorney representing exdeveloper bill 
walters said thursday that creditors include manufacturers hanover 
trust co mellon bank silverado and walters exwife mary lou 
walters 
jones said creditors probably will get only a fraction of what 
they are owed the case was filed last week in us bankruptcy 
court in santa ana calif 
there are a few assets available possibly a few hundred 
thousand dollars jones told the denver post bill is a good 
guy who has gotten a lot of bad publicity he was at the end of his 
rope 
walters became a prominent figure in the nations thrift crisis 
because of his business relationship with president bushs son 
neil a silverado director 
bush voted to approve the 106 million in loans to walters who 
then defaulted on all the loans 
later it was disclosed that walters invested 150000 in neil 
bushs unsuccessful jnb exploration oil company and extended him a 
175 million line of credit through his cherry creek national 
bank 
during early and mid1980s walters 45 was one of denvers 
highestprofile developers listing his net worth at 200 million 
during those years he was chairman of the greater denver chamber 
of commerce in 198788 
walters developed 35 million square feet of office and 
residential property in the denver area and controlled 24 million 
square feet of undeveloped land the size of downtown denver 
in addition to cherry creek national bank he purchased the 
south denver national bank and the bank of westminster 
but the oil bust took its toll on walters real estate and 
banking holdings he sold cherry creek national bank in 1988 and it 
failed last month the other two banks failed in 1987 
the bankruptcy filing lists walters biggest creditors as 
manufacturers hanover owed 111 million and mellon bank owed 23 
million jones said walters owes silverado 185 million the part 
of the 106 million that jones says walters is personally liable 
for and mary lou walters about 535 million 
earlier this year walters told a congressional panel 
investigating silverados 1 billion failure that he was broke but 
vowed not to seek bankruptcy protection and to pay back what he 
owed silverado 
but a few weeks later walters was found to be living in a 19 
million estate in newport beach calif listed in the name of his 
wife jacqueline the government has filed a 200 million lawsuit 
against bush and other former silverado directors for their role in 
the thrifts failure

the food and drug administration has approved 
the first medication for the treatment of panic disorder a disease 
that will affect 3 million americans at some point in their 
lifetimes 
the medication is xanax made by the upjohn co and was approved 
in 1981 for the treatment for clinical anxiety and anxiety 
associated with depression 
panic disorder is characterized by repeated panic attacks in 
which a patient is struck by intense fear symptoms of panic 
attacks can include chest pain shortness of breath dizziness 
trembling and sweating nausea and abdominal distress the symptoms 
often mimic a heart attack 
the company announcing the fda action thursday estimated that 
between 1 percent and 2 percent of the population an estimated 3 
million americans will suffer from panic disorder in their 
lifetimes 
for about 60 percent of people with the disorder it will 
disrupt their social and working lives which can lead to secondary 
depression said officials of the company based in kalamazoo mich 
a biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is believed to cause 
panic attacks the company said xanax known generically as 
alprazolam can block the attacks by interacting with several 
different systems in the brain 
upjohn studied alprazolams role in the treatment of the 
disorder in a twophase study that involved more than 1700 patients 
in more than 14 countries the company said 
common side effects included sedation and fatigue and they 
subsided when the dose was reduced or as the medication was 
continued upjohn said however higher doses of xanax may be 
needed for longer periods of time to treat panic disorder the 
company said and this could lead to greater chance for dependence 
upjohn officials said that when the treatment is being 
discontinued gradual dosage reduction under a physicians 
direction is essential to minimize the potential for adverse 
effects

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
signed a historic nonaggression treaty with chancellor helmut kohl 
today and got a heros welcome for letting the berlin wall and iron 
curtain collapse 
gorbachevs first visit to united germany came on the first 
anniversary of the opening of the berlin wall a fitting 
coincidence because his reforms helped bring the cold war barrier 
down 
both kohl and gorbachev stressed the importance of the 
historical changes that have allowed closer ties as they signed the 
broad agreement that is to serve as the foundation of future 
relations 
having signed this document one could hardly think about 
until recently we have officially ended a whole historical process 
and opened a deep perspective for ourselves said gorbachev 
in the treaty initialed in moscow on sept 13 both nations 
pledge not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all 
european nations 
a shortlived alliance between germany and the soviet union at 
the start of world war ii contributed to the deaths of 27 million 
soviet citizens when the allies became foes 
we are closing the book on the painful past and clearing the 
way for a new beginning kohl said in a speech at the signing 
cermony 
gorbachev arrived at colognebonn airport this morning in an 
ilyushin62 and was met by a 27man german military honor guard 
he was greeted by foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and 
gave a hearty wave as he stepped out of the plane 
later gorbachev was greeted by president richard von 
weizsaecker at the governments villa hammerschmidt palace next to 
the rhine river 
gorbachev and his wife raisa stopped to chat with a crowd of 
people waiting for him outside the palace before entering 
mrs gorbachev later visited the picturesque city of linz on the 
rhine river with kohls wife hannelore 
the 20year nonaggression treaty that kohl and gorbachev signed 
aims to assist gorbachevs financially strapped nation details on 
the amount of future german aid were expected to dominate their 
behindthescenes talks 
kohl is grateful to gorbachev for his blessing of german unity 
and has said many times gorbachev should get help in mastering 
problems at home 
we germans have many reasons to give thanks to mikhail 
gorbachev volker ruehe general secretary of kohls christian 
democrats said thursday 
a festive reception was planned for gorbachev his wife raisa 
and for soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
kohl arranged to hold private talks with gorbachev in bonn today 
and at his home in oggersheim 45 miles south of frankfurt on 
saturday 
gorbachev was to spend tonight at the opulent petersberg guest 
house just outside bonn on a mountain overlooking the rhine river 
a state dinner is scheduled at the government guest house this 
evening 
kohl has scheduled a visit for gorbachev to speyer home of the 
11thcentury speyer cathedral resting place for eight german 
emperors 
the two leaders also planned a trip to deidesheim a village 
known for its wines 
shevardnadze and genscher on saturday are to fly to genschers 
hometown halle in former east germany after lunch genscher

in the sands of saudi arabia 
untested soldiers and combat veterans are playing a different 
waiting game many of the young are itching for war the men whove 
been there are hoping for peace 
marine lance cpl wayne lewis 21 of reading pa said after 
years of watching war movies he wants to experience the real thing 
and go home 
after 30 years in the marines and two tours in vietnam brig 
gen mike myatt commander of the 30000member marine ground force 
in northeastern saudi arabia said he hopes his men will leave the 
desert without firing a shot 
its the classic dichotomy age and experience versus youth and 
impatience 
as operation desert shield enters its fourth month the 
impatience to attack the iraqis and liberate kuwait is increasing 
especially in the lower ranks 
but those who have survived the carnage of the battlefield seem 
more inclined to wait for economic sanctions and diplomatic efforts 
to deliver an unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait 
about 230000 americans are in the persian gulf region at the 
moment only to defend saudi arabia but clearly training for an 
offensive operation against iraqi leader saddam husseins troops if 
president bush gives the word 
their average age is probably in the low 20s and youths with 
pimples definitely outnumber grayhaired veterans 
for lewis an environmental and safety specialist with vertical 
marine fighter attack squadron 311 the possibility of death is a 
risk sort of like being a police officer 
we see all the movies and want to go to war and see what its 
really like he said 
the older marines just want to go home theyve got wives 
and families to go to some of them have already seen it 
happen they dont want to go through it again lewis said 
i just think the older people want to take their time said 
senior airman mike beam 22 of houston with the 401st supply 
squadron we just want to go in and clean house and go home 
all of us dont want this to be another vietnam war do it 
once take them out and just make iraq a big parking lot 
as myatt ran his officers through a war game responding to a 
twopronged iraqi attack on eastern saudi arabia he recalled 
vietnam and said those who have fought before are hoping this can 
be solved by political or diplomatic means 
nobody whos been in combat ever wants to go back into combat 
but they know that if we have to we have to be ready said 
myatt 49 
that was echoed by capt dean hendrickson 46 of jacksonville 
fla a 23year veteran who now commands air wing 17 on the uss 
saratoga where the crews average age is between 19 and 20 
anybody whos been in this stuff before doesnt look forward 
to it said hendrickson who flew fighters in vietnam 
sgt rosie abraham 35 of selma ala with the armys 326th 
medical battalion who missed vietnam said she wants to go home 
with all my parts and is prepared to wait 
the younger ones is like hurry up lets get this over 
with she said i dont think they understand whats the 
meaning of seeing somebody all shot up a leg here an ankle over 
there a hand over here 
army sgt michael hellon 24 of orange county calif with the 
525 military intelligence brigade of the 18th airborne corps 
dismissed the bravado of the triggerhappy kids as pure hype 
nobody wants to go to war he said they just talk a bunch 
of junk when the bullets start flying theyll be the first ones 
in the foxholes with their heads down 
certainly not all young servicemen are triggerhappy 
senior airman dan abert 21 of syracuse ny with the 1st air 
medical evacuation squadron had some advice for the president 
wait it out to the max he said bush is getting pretty 
tense and i think saddam wants to see that maybe he should go to 
maine for a little while longer come back and sit it out

president bush today signed legislation to 
extend mostfavorednation trade benefits to czechoslovakia 
he called the measure an important milestone not only in 
usczechoslovak relations but also in czechoslovakias 
reintegration into the global economy and the community of free 
nations 
under the agreement the united states and czechoslovakia will 
grant each the lowest possible tariffs on their goods 
the bush administration earlier awarded the preferentialtrade 
status to poland and hungary in the aftermath of the upheaval in 
eastern europe 
bush said he was particularly pleased to sign the measure at 
this time because he will be in prague czechoslovakia later this 
month as part of an eightday trip to europe and the persian gulf 
he praised the warsawpact nation for tremendous strides 
toward economic reform and trade liberalization 
mostfavorednation status is denied to countries that do not 
have open markets or which have restrictive emigration policies 
toddys action will result in sharply lower tariffs for 
czechoslovakias exports to the united states and vice versa 
before the new benefits can take effect czechoslovakias federal 
assembly must give the arrangement final approval 
bush said the move will provide the impetus for greatly 
expanded trade between the united states and czechoslovakia and the 
first step toward a normalization of our bilateral trade 
relations 
the united states has also offered to grant the soviet union 
such status but it is being delayed until the soviet union enacts 
a moreliberalized policy on emigration by soviets jews and other 
minorities

indias new prime minister chandra 
shekhar is the aging angry young man of indian politics 
leftleaning since his university days the 63yearold 
politician tapped for the job friday has long advocated social and 
economic justice for indias masses most of indias top political 
leaders have 
few have had much luck changing things in a country of 880 
million people where fewer than half can read and write and the 
average annual income is barely 300 
but chandra shekhar who seems to be perpetually scowling 
through his saltandpepper beard knows a little more about such 
things than most of his fellow players at the top ranks of the 
national political game 
he was born in the village of ibrahimpatti near the borders of 
uttar pradesh and bihar state 460 miles southeast of new delhi 
the region is geographically remote but politically in the 
center of northern indias hindu heartland it has produced all of 
the countrys prime ministers 
years ago chandra shekhar told an interviewer he was the first 
educated man from his village of 1000 people my mother is 
illiterate my father too is hardly literate he said 
but like all of indias prime ministers he came from an upper 
caste in the complex hindu social system which automatically 
confers pride and privilege if not wealth 
chandra shekhar rejected this hedropped his familys surname 
of singh which made him instantly recognizable as a member of the 
thakur or landlord caste he now goes only by his first 
name chandra shekhar which is written as two words 
he studied political science at allahabad university in uttar 
pradesh state and joined obscure socialist groups 
in 1967 he switched to the congress party that produced indias 
first prime minister jawaharlal nehru and the prime ministerial 
dynasty of nehrus daughter indira gandhi and her son rajiv 
gandhi 
chandra shekhar was briefly a stalwart of mrs gandhi 
supporting her decision to nationalize banks and abolish the 
maharajahs privy purses but he broke with her as she moved deeper 
into authoritarian rule culminating in the state of emergency from 
1975 to 1977 when she suspended civil rights and elections 
he was one of thousands of political leaders jailed by mrs 
gandhi during the emergency much of his 21 months in prison was 
spent in solitary confinement 
when mrs gandhi lifted the emergency and overconfidently 
called elections in 1977 chandra shekhar was among the founders of 
the janata party that defeated her but the prime ministers job 
went to someone else chandra shekhar became the partys president 
less than two years later the janata government fell part in 
internal bickering 
history looks like its ready to repeat itself except this 
time the party broke apart before the government did 
chandra shekhar remained president of the janata party until 
1988 when it disbanded to become a major component of the janata 
dal party a collection of politicians drawn together by little 
more than their dislike of rajiv gandhi 
he joined the janata dal led by singh the prime minister whose 
11monthold government was ousted in a parliament vote wednesday 
only two days before the vote chandra shekhar led a breakaway 
faction of the janata dal party in opposing singh 
chandra shekhar calls his splinter group the janata dal 
socialist which counts between 50 and 60 members in the 522seat 
policymaking lower house of parliament for the moment at least 
he has the support of his longtime foe rajiv gandhi and gandhis 
195member congress party 
how long chandra shekhar can keep the prime ministers job is 
questionable gandhi after a year as opposition leader is waiting 
in the wings for yet another noncongress party government to 
disintegrate if the congress party withdraws support it is 
unlikely chandra shekhar could find sufficient support elsewhere to 
survive 
until the current political maneuvering chandra shekhar was 
bestknown in india for the 2500mile walk he did over six months 
in 1983 
he traveled from indias southernmost tip to new delhi saying 
he wanted to see firsthand and dramatize the plight of the 
countrys downtrodden it was a tactic borrowed from indias 
beloved independence leader and apostle of nonviolence mohandas k 
gandhi the mahatma or great soul 
but chandra shekhars padayatra or foot travel 
produced little more than publicity for him

the white dutch reformed church 
joined other christian denominations friday in rejecting apartheid 
as a sin and confessed the churchs role in implementing it 
the main church of the dutchdescended afrikaners who dominate 
the government had argued for decades that the bible supported the 
system of legalized segregation the position isolated it from 
other denominations 
but at the end of a weeklong conference of 90 christian 
churches leaders of the white dutch reformed church joined in 
supporting a statement the rustenberg declaration condemning 
church participation in apartheid 
we confess our own sin and acknowledge our heretical part in 
the policy of apartheid which has led to such extreme suffering 
the joint statement said 
we denounce apartheid in its intention its implementation 
and its consequences as an evil policy the statement added 
the conference in rustenburg 60 miles northwest of 
johannesburg was the largest ever gathering of christian churches 
in south africa 
the declaration also recommended the government remove all 
apartheid laws set up a oneperson onevote democracy seek 
equitable wealth distribution restore land to blacks and arrange 
an affirmative action program to advance blacks 
the rev peter potgieter head of the dutch reformed church 
told an impromptu news conference during final debate on the 
document that his church disagreed with some elements he said it 
objected specifically to the call for a oneperson onevote 
electoral system and other political recommendations but agreed 
with the condemnation and confession of apartheid 
potgieter also said the document was not official church policy 
which must be decided by the churchs synod 
for years the white dutch reformed church has been isolated 
from most other christian churches because of its refusal to reject 
the apartheid system of racial segregation and white dominance 
it argued for decades that the bible supported apartheid citing 
biblical passages that referred to different people in different 
nations the church also considered whites and afrikaners in 
particular a chosen people destined to rule south africa as 
part of gods will 
in a major policy statement in 1960 the church said segregation 
could be justified twentysix years later it declared racial 
discrimination a sin but withheld comment on apartheid 
the mere presence of white dutch reformed church leaders at the 
conference marked a breakthrough in interchurch relations 
organizers said 
the rev frank chikane leader of the south african council of 
churches praised the document but said he understood the dutch 
reformed churchs hesitation to give it full support 
i feel that we have started a process and im just hoping the 
dutch reformed church will be able to move ahead with us he 
said i understand theyre constrained they have to answer back 
to their own membership chikane added 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu said he hoped the white 
churchs objections avoided critical sections of the declaration 
obviously what we hear is political tutu said it is 
going to be up to them to demonstrate through action what they have 
said in words 
the rustenburg declaration said all south african churches 
should have done more to resist apartheid 
some of us actively misused the bible to justify apartheid 
leading many to believe that it had the sanction of god it said 
other churches the document said ignored apartheid by 
preaching the sufficiency of individual salvation without social 
transformation 
we adopted an allegedly neutral stance which in fact resulted 
in complicity with apartheid it said 
some churches condemned apartheid but did little to resist the 
statement added 
those of us who were the victims of apartheid acknowledge our 
own contribution to the failure of the church it said 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church has about 1 
million members including president fw de klerk and most of his 
cabinet there are separate branches for blacks and people of 
mixedrace which have staunchly opposed apartheid 
the white branch of the dutch reformed church said last month it 
wants to merge with its sister churches but no action has been 
taken

american military forces in the persian gulf 
will reach up to 430000 within weeks nearly doubling existing 
us firepower in the region and matching iraqs troop strength in 
kuwait 
defense secretary dick cheney said today half of all american 
land forces in europe would be moved to the persian gulf about 
200000 army troops are stationed in europe most in germany 
those 100000 europeanbased troops would join 230000 us 
troops already deployed to the gulf and another 100000 being sent 
abroad from us bases president bush signed deployment orders for 
the dramatic new escalation on thursday 
the scale of the additional us troop deployments is enormous 
once the added forces are in place america will have more troops 
in the gulf region than it had in europe during the cold war when 
the perceived enemy was a nuclear superpower about onethird of 
the armys worldwide force will be in the saudi desert 
bush also ordered the navy to dispatch three aircraft carrier 
battle groups to the gulf area in addition to the three already 
there today the navy announced it was sending the uss theodore 
roosevelt and the uss america both based at norfolk va and the 
uss ranger from san diego calif each of the carriers includes 
about 80 aircraft and about 5500 sailors 
the navy said it would announce later which escort ships would 
accompany the carriers 
cheneys remarks today to the conservative leadership conference 
indicated that president bush intends to have about 430000 us 
forces in the gulf area within weeks equaling the current level 
of iraqi troops in and around kuwait 
the additional increment will give us the capacity to 
undertake offensive action should that become necessary cheney 
said 
he suggested in comments to reporters later that bushs new 
order means the approximately 230000 us forces already there 
will not be rotating back to the united states early next year as 
cheney had tentatively planned 
asked whether the full contingent of american forces in the gulf 
would be there for the duration of the crisis cheney said 
thats correct 
bush said thursday in announcing new deployments for operation 
desert shield that he still hoped to get iraq out of kuwait without 
starting a war but he said he wanted an adequate offensive 
military option in case united nations economic sanctions and 
diplomatic pressures against iraq prove futile 
analysts said the move brought the united states closer to war 
with iraq 
the iraqis in effect are being put on notice that they will 
be attacked unless they withdraw from kuwait under bushs terms 
said frank gaffney jr director of the center for security policy 
and a former pentagon official 
about 230000 us air ground and sea forces now are in and 
around saudi arabia and a coalition of other western and arab 
nations has put at least 100000 troops in the gulf area the iraqi 
force in kuwait and southern iraq is estimated at 430000 
bush and pentagon officials refused to disclose specific numbers 
of weapons and soldiers in the gulf region but additional army 
forces being brought in from germany will more than double the 
number of us tanks in saudi arabia to about 2000 judging from 
organization charts and estimates by army sources 
the pentagon estimates that iraq has about 3500 tanks in and 
around kuwait 
bush said he hoped iraqi president saddam hussein viewed the 
steppedup us deployments to the gulf as evidence that the 
western and arab coalition arrayed against him was serious about 
using military force if diplomatic and economic pressures fail 
if this movement of force is what convinces him so much the 
better bush said he added later when he surveys the force 
thats there he will recognize that he is up against just a foe 
that he cant possibly manage militarily 
i am concerned that the administration is moving to establish 
an offensive capacity in advance of a un resolution authorizing 
offensive action said sen claiborne pell dri chairman of 
the senate foreign relations committee he said the international 
trade embargo against iraq has not had a decent chance to produce 
results 
the marines are sending the 2nd marine expeditionary force from 
camp lejeune nc which includes roughly 45000 men and is about 
equal to the marine unit now in the gulf in addition the marines 
are deploying the 5th marine expeditionary brigade from camp 
pendleton calif with at least 5000 men and the fourship 1st 
maritime prepositioning ship squadron from norfolk va 
that doubles the size of the marine commitment to desert shield 
and taps virtually all the marine combat power available in the 
united states according to senior marine corps officials 
the marines also will have a few thousand men aboard a group of 
navy ships that form a specially tailored amphibious assault unit 
to be deployed from san diego calif one such amphibious unit 
already is afloat in the gulf together they could be used to 
launch an assault on kuwait city where western hostages are being 
held 
bush ordered the navy to send three aircraft carrier battle 
groups to the gulf area to join the three the uss saratoga the 
uss midway and the uss john f kennedy that already are there he 
did not say which carriers would be added 
the navy also is sending the uss missouri a world war iiera 
battleship equipped with 16inch guns tomahawk cruise missiles and 
nearly 2000 crew members one battleship the uss wisconsin has 
been in the gulf since late summer 
the army is transferring the equivalent of about 2 armored 
divisions from germany plus command units and the famous big 
red one 1st infantry division mechanized from fort riley kan 
for the first time in the crisis the pentagon also ordered 
combat units of the army national guard to active duty

mary robinson a lawyer who had fought to 
legalize divorce and contraception was elected president of 
ireland today 
mrs robinson the first woman elected to the office overtook 
former deputy prime minister and defense minister brian lenihan on 
the second round of counting election officials said 
she finished with 528 percent of the vote said tim sexton who 
supervised the count 
in an interview minutes before the announcement mrs robinson 
noted that it was the anniversary of the opening of the berlin 
wall 
and i think something has crumbled away in this election the 
old preconceptions the old political ways said mrs robinson 
who in the past had battled church and state in campaigns to 
liberalize irish society 
i think the joy and the hope and the sense of moving forward 
in this election is quite tangible she said 
she will be inaugurated dec 3 succeeding patrick hillery who 
must retire after two sevenyear terms in the largely ceremonial 
post 
mrs robinson received 848 percent of the secondpreference 
votes from supporters of austin currie the fine gael party nominee 
who ran third 
in the first round of counting lenihan of the fianna fail party 
had 441 percent of the vote to 389 percent for mrs robinson and 
curries 17 percent 
since no one got a majority in the first round the result 
turned on the second choices marked by curries supporters 
mrs robinson was nominated by the leftist labor party and the 
workers party but she belongs to neither the two parties pulled a 
combined 147 percent of the vote in last years parliamentary 
election she is the first president since 1945 not a member of the 
majority fianna fail party 
it was irelands first contested presidential election in 17 
years 
mrs robinson 46 served 20 years in the irish senate but found 
more success in the courts in pressing her causes of equality for 
women and minorities as an advocate of legalized divorce and 
contraception she was often at odds with much of the country and 
her own roman catholic church 
earlier today mrs robinson said she had been elated when it 
became clear that she was in position to win 
i had this extraordinary sensation of just how important it 
was particularly for women she told reporters at her dublin 
home 
i quite literally wanted to go out and dance in the street i 
almost had to be restrained i know the joy that is there in so 
many peoples hearts they have told me how much this election 
means to them and i know why 
anticipating her victory the irish times said in an editorial 
today the election marks the point at which a narrow and often 
cruel road journeyed by a society often narrow and cruel gives 
the first sign of broadening out 
the irish press said the election signals a change in irish 
society and a shift away from traditional attitudes and 
allegiances 
mrs robinson is a lecturer on european community law at trinity 
college her alma mater she also holds a masters degree from 
harvard 
fianna fail and fine gael which have dominated ireland since it 
gained independence from britain in 1922 are both conservative on 
social and economic issues 
lenihan 59 was perhaps the most popular man in fianna fail and 
had been expected to win the election easily but prime minister 
charles haughey was forced to dismiss lenihan as deputy prime 
minister and defense minister last week to save his coalition 
government from collapse 
lenihan was accused of lying about his role in a 1982 effort by 
fianna fail leaders seeking to avoid a national election following 
a noconfidence vote against the government of former prime 
minister garret fitzgerald 
currie 51 was a leader in the catholic civil rights campaign 
in northern ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the social 
democratic and labor party the main catholic party in northern 
ireland he was elected last year to the dail the lower house of 
irelands parliament

leaders of the presidents drug advisory 
council said friday that president bush should speak on television 
twice a year to reinforce his commitment to the war on drugs 
they also urged the countrys 500 richest businesses to pay for 
antidrug booklets for each of the nations 32 million gradeschool 
children and said all professional sports team uniforms should 
carry antidrug patches 
there needs to be a national image a national symbol a 
national logo that everyone can look at like the american flag 
said orange county sheriff brad gates founder of californias drug 
use is life abuse program 
the councils national leadership forum heard from the heads of 
three substance abuse programs in california florida and 
washington singled out as national models 
this is not a war on drugs this is really a rebuilding effort 
rebuilding our communities so we have safe places to live and 
work and go to school said paul dziedzic special assistant to 
washington gov booth gardner 
edward thad foote president of the university of miami and 
chairman of the miami coalition said his group has determined that 
some old assumptions about drug abuse were wrong 
we were perilously close to just throwing up our hands a few 
years ago foote said we found out this problem wasnt going 
to go away by building more jails or sending more ships to the 
caribbean 
dade county has demolished 700 crack cocaine houses in miami 
over two years and boasts a virtually unheard of 4 percent 
recidivism rate in an alternative drug court that expunges 
criminal records of drug abusers who complete treatmenteducation 
programs within a year foote said 
and we finally figured out if you want to break the cycle of 
addiction for poor sick people youve got to find them a job he 
said 
gates said orange county has beefed up law enforcement but also 
made a priority of changing attitudes about drugs through a 
marketing approach modeled after antismoking campaigns 
the california program has made popular a logo drug use is 
life abuse it also enlisted the help of walt disney co to 
develop a booklet with three animated animal characters skippy 
spike and wise owl mike who preach against substance abuse 
through a rap song 
the booklets could be published for 10 cents each if the 
nations top 500 companies would donate a total of 32 million for 
mass production of 32 million copies he said 
gates said the los angeles rams sported an antidrug emblem on 
their uniform in 1989 but the idea has been opposed by the nfl and 
other sports leagues we need a logo on the uniform of every 
professional sports team football baseball basketball and 
soccer he said

mikhail s gorbachev today praised the 
nations opposing iraqs aggression in the persian gulf and said 
saddam husseins attempts to divide the multinational effort are 
bound to fail 
however gorbachev was evasive when he was asked whether he 
would support the use of force to drive iraqi troops from kuwait 
or whether soviet soldiers might take part in such a miliary 
action 
earlier this week gorbachevs foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze gave qualified support for a proposed un resolution 
authorizing the use of force by the armies navies and air forces 
of many nations arrayed against iraq 
the soviet president told reporters today that the un efforts 
to isolate iraq have been a victory for the nations 
participating 
everything we have done up to now has been a great 
victory said gorbachev pointing out the scope of the 
international effort to isolate iraq 
for the first time in history we have acted together in so 
critical a situation he said let no one reckon on driving a 
wedge into that unity 
gorbachevs remarks which are similar to comments on the gulf 
crisis that he and other soviet officials have made earlier came 
during a news conference on the first day of a twoday official 
visit to germany 
as proof of the international victory gorbachev noted that 
oil is still being pumped in the middle east and the world 
economy is functioning 
gorbachev said it will be up to the united nations to decide 
what steps to take next against in the gulf crisis 
the united nations should now decide how to proceed further 
said gorbachev adding we should act firmly and consistently 
we have condemned the aggressor all attempts to shake unity 
will continue to be doomed he added 
saddam has repeatedly tried to divide the antiiraq forces by 
releasing some countries hostages while holding onto others 
he has also tried to divide the west from its arab allies by 
saying that negotiations over his invasion of kuwait should be tied 
to a solution of the dispute over israels occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
gorbachev said that the gulf crisis is presenting the world with 
a test of the new politics of international cooperation that 
have evolved with the end of the cold war he said the crisis has 
set off a search for a new approach that is politically 
appropriate for dealing with the problem

members of congress say president bushs 
massive deployment of nearly 200000 additional us forces to the 
persian gulf is a signal to the nation to get ready for war 
i think the american people need to prepare themselves for a 
major conflict in the middle east said rep ike skelton dmo 
a senior member of the house armed services committee 
there was cautious support for the latest military buildup but 
rep charles rangel was harshly critical of bushs action 
with this troop buildup the president is sending every signal 
that instead of seeking peaceful solutions he plans to rush the 
nation into war rangel said friday 
rangel dny suggested that while many us allies have 
placed a stronger emphasis on a diplomatic solution to the more 
than threemonth stalemate the president really seems to be 
going his own way on this 
sen steve symms ridaho said he wouldnt second guess bush 
the president symms said has sole responsibility for 
assuring we have adequate military might 
rep lee hamilton dind said that although bush has broad 
support from the american people the backing is very thin 
theres a great deal of uneasiness about all of this he 
said they do not want american casualties they feel that very 
very strongly 
hamilton chairman of the house foreign affairs middle east 
subcommittee said bush needs to be more precise and more 
articulate than he has been about the reasons for our deployment 
there and precisely what our commitment has been 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 a week later bush sent thousands 
of us forces to saudi arabia and the gulf area to stop further 
iraqi aggression 
on thursday bush announced the deployment of additional forces 
to provide the united states with the offensive power necessary if 
there is a conflict with the 430000 iraqis in and around kuwait 
the list of units involved indicates as many as 200000 more 
americans will be sent 
defense secretary dick cheney indicated friday that the 
approximately 230000 us forces already in the area wont be 
rotated back to the united states early next year as the pentagon 
had planned 
democratic rep jim slattery of kansas said he hoped the 
increase in us troops would lead to a peaceful solution 
hopefully deployment will convince saddam hussein to 
retreat from kuwait slattery said 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee expressed concern that the united states was 
moving to create an offensive capability in advance of a un 
resolution authorizing offensive action 
the united states should not be the unilateral policeman of 
the world pell said 
slattery pell and skelton made their comments thursday night

advisers to gov l douglas wilder have 
formed a committee that could be converted to a presidential 
campaign organization if the nations first elected black governor 
decides to run in 1992 
thats absolutely true paul goldman chairman of the 
democratic party of virginia said friday of the committee for 
fiscal responsibility in 1992 yes we will be fund raising but 
thats not the primary purpose 
papers to create the committee were filed thursday with the 
federal election commission in washington dc goldman is 
executive director of the committee and mark warner of alexandria 
a key fundraising adviser to the governor is its treasurer 
goldman said the committee is designed to promote a message of 
fiscal responsibility as part of the theme the democratic party 
should present to the country in 1992 
he said the committee could make contributions to candidates who 
share the goal of fiscal responsibility it also would help send 
committee members who favor spending cuts over new taxes to 
meetings across the country 
the committee is not a campaign organization for wilder to seek 
the 1992 democratic nomination for president but could be made 
into one goldman said 
wilder declined to comment on the committee his spokeswoman 
laura dillard said that committee is something thats mr 
goldmans 
wilder the first elected black governor in us history has 
said he plans to serve out his term which ends in january 1994 
but he increasingly has thrust himself into the national 
spotlight by stumping for democratic candidates and by promoting 
his opposition to new taxes 
as governor wilder has ordered substantial spending cuts to 
meet a projected 14 billion shortfall in the state budget

the soviet union has given its qualified consent to the use of 
force and president bush has ordered more than 150000 additional 
troops to the persian gulf giving the multinational forces an 
offensive military option 
secretary of state james a baker iii flew from moscow to london 
today on his mission to strengthen allied resolve against iraqs 
3monthold occupation of kuwait baker will meet saturday with 
french leaders in paris 
in moscow a senior us official said today that saudi arabia 
egypt and other arab forces would fight alongside us troops to 
free kuwait but the official said the extent of frances support 
was not known 
in another boost for the antiiraqi forces mikhail s gorbachev 
today said saddam husseins attempts to divide the multinational 
effort are bound to fail speaking in germany where he is on an 
official visit gorbachev said everything we have done up to now 
has been a great victory 
for the first time in history we have acted together in so 
critical a situation let no one reckon on driving a wedge into 
that unity 
iraqs governmentrun newspaper said today that iraq and france 
conducted secret talks that led to the release of more than 300 
frenchmen from iraq 
the paper aljumhouriya said the talks between iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz and former french foreign minister claude 
cheysson were endorsed by the french government france has denied 
any deals were struck for hostages 
western officials have criticized efforts by former leaders 
including edward heath of britain yasuhiro nakasone of japan and 
willy brandt of germany to free hostages claiming they help 
divide the antiiraq alliance 
brandt left baghdad for frankfurt today with 177 westerners 
mostly germans but those on the flight included three americans 
and 14 britons seven more britons than originally indicated two 
americans were held back when iraqi officials told the us embassy 
their papers were not in order 
in a more personal attempt to influence saddam 11 british women 
headed to baghdad today to seek the release of their captive 
husbands and relatives against the advice of their government 
at the united nations today iraqs attempt to introduce a 
general assembly resolution criticizing the us military buildup 
in the perisan gulf drew a stinging rebuke when an assembly 
committee unanimously refused to consider it 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas pickering 
called the iraqi motion illfounded tendentious and 
mendacious 
president bush on thursday ordered the new troops to the gulf 
saying he wanted an adequate offensive military option should 
global sanctions fail to persuade saddam to withdraw from kuwait 
but despite the talk of offensive capability bush said he still 
hoped saddam would come to his senses and avoid combat by 
pulling out bush did not give numbers but pentagon officials said 
in private conversations that full deployment of the units involved 
would involve about 150000 troops 
defense secretary dick cheney said in washington today the new 
troop deployments would include onehalf of american land forces in 
germany he said bush intends to have about 430000 us forces in 
the gulf area within weeks 
the additional increment will give us the capacity to 
undertake offensive action should that become necessary cheney 
said today 
there are now 230000 us military personnel in the region 
allies from 26 countries have sent 100000 soldiers to the 
multinational force assembled in the area about 200000 army 
troops are stationed in europe most in germany 
iraqs ambassador to washington mohamed almashat called the 
new us deployment plan an unfortunate development 
there is no reason for this force or the previous force he 
said thursday on cbs america tonight we havent done anything 
to the united states 
believe you me we will never surrender or capitulate he 
said 
iraq has deployed an estimated 430000 soldiers in kuwait and 
southern iraq since invading its southern oilrich neighbor aug 2 
in a dispute over land oil and money 
the invasion increased iraqs share of world oil reserves to 20 
percent and sent crude prices skyrocketing 
in moscow meanwhile baker accomplished his goal of gaining 
soviet consent for the use of force should peaceful measures fail 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said military 
might should not be ruled out but cautioned it should be used only 
under un auspices 
a situation may emerge which effectively would require such a 
move shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with baker 
before the crisis moscow was baghdads principal ally and 
principal weapons supplier 
bush at his news conference said were on the same 
wavelength with gorbachev in terms of his policy goals in the 
middle east he said he felt there were no mixed signals from 
moscow 
the bush administration impatient that months of un economic 
sanctions have failed to dislodge saddams troops from kuwait 
intends to ask the un security council to authorize force if the 
baghdad government doesnt agree to a pullout 
the 11 british women left today for baghdad where they hope to 
ask saddam to release their husbands and relatives on humanitarian 
grounds 
the british foreign office advised the women against going and 
called the trip risky but they ignored the advice 
hundreds of americans are among those still trapped in iraq 
some held at strategic sites as human shields to deter attack 
by the usled multinational force in the region

the man accused of shooting to death radical 
rabbi meir kahane reportedly was taking the antidepressant prozac 
which has been blamed by some users for suicidal and homicidal 
behavior 
police confirmed friday that el sayyid nosair was taking an drug 
for depression but would not say which one the new york times 
reported he was taking the prescription drug prozac 
the drugs manufacturer eli lilly amp co inc has denied any 
connection between prozac and aberrant behavior a position 
reiterated friday by company spokesman edward a west 
according to press reports the shooting of rabbi kahane 
appears to have been a premeditated act by a distressed individual 
who was under a doctors care and may have been taking multiple 
drugs west said 
ongoing analysis of controlled doubleblind clinical trials 
do not support a causal relationship between prozac and violent 
behavior he said 
but several lawsuits against eli lilly cite the drug as a 
catalyst for murder and selfmutilation 
the son of a kentucky man who killed eight people in a 1989 
shooting rampage while taking prozac has sued the maker contending 
the drug is unsafe a long island woman who suffered through 18 
months of selfmutilation while on the drug also has sued the 
company for 150 million 
prozacs known side effects include nausea a rash agitation 
and jittery nerves 
nosair 34 remained in fair condition friday in the intensive 
care unit of bellevue hospital said spokeswoman karen crowe she 
refused to comment about medication 
he has been hospitalized since the monday night shooting of 
kahane an antiarab extremist nosair who is from egypt was 
wounded during an exchange of gunfire with a us postal police 
officer as he fled the slaying taking a bullet in the throat 
authorities said 
investigators have not linked nosair of cliffside park nj 
to any terrorist groups 
once out of intensive care nosair will continue his recovery at 
the bellevue medical unit for prisoners crowe said 
police have speculated nosairs depression stemmed from job 
frustration nosair who has an engineering degree was employed by 
the city as a heating and air conditioning mechanic

hardly a fair contest maybe but hot rod 
enthusiasts cheered a measure of revenge friday for a 13000pound 
monster truck that squashed a row of volvos 
some in the crowd figured the little guy deserved getting bashed 
this time the response of the us hot rod association to a volvo 
television commercial that has been pulled from the air 
i loved it it was great they had it coming to them said 
billie burns who brought three children ages 4 2 and 8 months 
from nearby folcroft to the exhibition in the parking lot of the 
spectrum sports arena the trucks had arrived for a weekend 
competition at the spectrum 
she was not impressed with the way the volvos held up briefly 
before succumbing to bearfoot and its 1000pound tires 
they were stomped she said with a grin 
in pittsburgh however another monster truck had big trouble 
with a volvo big boss and its 800pound tires got stuck on a 
1975 green volvo in the parking lot of civic arena 
burns like some other spectators said they came to see volvos 
comeuppance for an ad in which a volvo appeared to be the only car 
left relatively intact in a line of autos run over by bearfoot 
the texas attorney general challenged the ad and the company 
pulled it this week saying that unknown to volvo the volvo in the 
line of cars had been reinforced 
friday bearfoot and two other monster trucks predator and 
black stallion took turns getting their own licks in as tv crews 
and a small crowd watched 
we dont have a knock against volvo hot rod association 
spokesman steve greenberg said were doing this in goodnatured 
fun it is tongueincheek 
there is a reputation to uphold here he added citing 
questions caused by the ad about the power of the monster trucks 
which he said draw 4 million fans a year to events around the 
country 
the junked volvos in philadelphia were no match over the long 
haul but the trucks needed a few swipes to get the job done the 
roar of the trucks drowned the crowds cheers with each pass 
the whiteandblue predator crushed a line of five cars a 
pontiac three chevys and a volvo in the middle the roof of the 
volvo wagon held up enough that it might have protected passengers 
then black stallion took one run at a line of six volvos 
breaking them in for four runs by bearfoot one on the end gave the 
trucks particular trouble before giving way bearfoot finally 
finished it by coming at an angle to smash another that had roof 
supports still standing coming to rest on the crushed car 
bearfoot driver todd blaeser said he was surprised by how well 
the volvos held up usually he said a line of cars would be 
finished off in two or three runs 
asked if volvo had passed the test he looked at the pile of six 
crushed cars with the metallic blue truck on top of it and said 
it doesnt look like it does it 
weve run into volvos that have stood out in a pile of cars as 
being tougher said blaeser 23 of chippewa falls wis 
volvo spokesman robert austin watched the car stomping on 
television from his office and said while the volvos didnt come 
out unscathed they appeared to hold up well compared with other 
cars 
at one point the predator got stuck on the volvo on its third 
pass over the five cars 
it was apparent that the volvo was standing up to the full 
weight of the truck so i would leave it to the public to draw 
their own conclusions austin said

former contra rebels attacked a police 
station in eastern nicaragua on friday leaving three guerrillas 
dead in the most violent antigovernment clash in months a cabinet 
official said 
thirtyfive people including nine police officers were wounded 
in the battle said interior minister carlos hurtado 
the attack appeared to be part of a growing weeklong protest in 
the eastern half of the country of president violeta chamorros 
economic policies her administrations ties with the opposition 
leftist sandinistas and a failure to keep promises of resettlement 
aid to demobilized contras 
hurtado told reporters the attack in nueva guinea about 190 
miles east of managua took place before dawn he said 21 people 
were arrested but only five were held on weapons charges hurtado 
said the three dead were former contras 
the attackers fired on the station with ak47 assault rifles 
then fled to a nearby church where they surrendered hurtado said 
the dissidents seized government buildings in another eastern 
town thursday night the protests started last week by blocking the 
main highway linking eastern and western nicaragua it remained 
barricaded friday 
armed forces chief gen humberto ortega has threatened to use 
the army to clear the road but so far the military has taken no 
action 
protesters have demanded withdrawal of all sandinistacontrolled 
security forces along the rama road and the removal of hurtado the 
cabinet official in charge of internal security and mrs 
chamorros soninlaw antonio lacayo 
lacayo is minister of the presidency and holds most of the power 
behind the scenes in the administration 
much of the resentment stems from mrs chamorros decision to 
keep the sandinistas in control of the military and police

mary robinson is a woman of forceful 
opinions about the rights of women and minorities opinions she 
will be obliged to keep to herself as president of ireland 
that doesnt really worry me she said late in her campaign 
if im elected thats an enormous boost and my views are 
known what i would represent is more space and more pluralism and 
more tolerance just by being elected 
mary robinson is the first woman and the first candidate of the 
left to be president of ireland 
the president is the honorific and symbolic head of state 
said tom garvin lecturer in politics at university college in 
dublin by tradition they are expected to be above politics 
in 1976 when president cearbhall o dalaigh exercised his power 
to refer legislation to the supreme court for review there was 
such an uproar in parliament that he felt compelled to resign 
if mrs robinson decides to challenge the traditional 
constraints placed on irish presidents it wont be the first time 
she has challenged the status quo 
when mrs robinson entered the senate in 1969 she was the first 
roman catholic to represent trinity college a historically 
protestant institution and at age 25 she was irelands youngest 
senator and trinitys youngest professor of law 
born in the county mayo town of ballina mary bourke grew up in 
a country that was deeply conservative and dominated by the roman 
catholic church 
her parents both physicians treated her the same as her four 
brothers nobody ever expressed any surprise that i wanted to be 
a lawyer or to do anything different from the boys she once 
said 
if she wanted something she worked with it and got it 
quietly and without fuss but very purposefully her father dr 
aubrey bourke said on thursday 
she accepted a scholarship to trinity college which her church 
then regarded as offlimits when she married a protestant fellow 
law student nick robinson her disapproving parents refused to 
attend the ceremony 
after winning a firstclass honors degree at trinity then a 
masters in law from harvard she jumped into public life 
she introduced legislation in the senate in 1970 to make 
contraceptives legally available and tried again in 1973 and 1974 
in 1976 she proposed that ireland legalize divorce 
she won court cases to permit women to serve on juries to 
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality to restore inheritance 
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators such 
as herself the same pension rights as their male colleagues 
contraceptives were made available by law to bona fide 
couples in 1979 and to anyone over 18 in 1985 but the ban on 
divorce was upheld in a national referendum in 1986 abortion is 
still illegal 
though she is president of cherish which supports single women 
who decide to carry pregnancies to term she also represented 
students at trinity college who were providing information about 
the availability of abortion in britain 
the denial of information is simply putting a further load on 
women who are going to go anyway she said in a recent interview 
the statistics in england show that the numbers are remaining 
at the same level but they are going later at greater risk i 
think that is very cruel and very inhumane she said 
the decision to run for president mrs robinson has said was 
not entirely her own it was put to a vote around the dinner table 
and approved by her husband her daughter tessa 18 and sons 
william 16 and aubrey 9 
tall slender and a bit reserved mrs robinson began 
campaigning for the largely ceremonial office in may her staff 
estimates that she rolled up 25000 miles crisscrossing the country 
in a bus that relentlessly blared an insipid instrumental version 
of the simon and garfunkel tune mrs robinson 
the candidates intention was to shake up the country and to 
challenge a frontrunner who she said simply offered more of 
the same 
asked what she thought was wrong with her country she said 
irish society isnt sufficiently pluralist for a start 
insufficiently tolerant of difference we havent got it in our 
constitution in our laws or in our ethos 
as president she said she would make the sprawling official 
mansion in dublins phoenix park a forum for contact and discussion 
for all manner of groups 
the hand of friendship would also be extended she said to 
the protestants of northern ireland who reject any thought of 
uniting with the republic she will head

eds corrects spelling of pentagon spokesman oborn in 2nd and 3rd 
grafs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
commercial satellite companies are selling 
photographs of the persian gulf that could provide sensitive 
military details about iraqi and us troop deployments in the 
region 
the pentagon has tried to keep secret operational information 
about troops in saudi arabia but has not made any move to block 
satellite companies from selling the commercial film spokesman 
rick oborn said 
oborn said he had not seen any commercial satellite pictures but 
said he would be concerned if they revealed operational 
information he said he knew of no attempts to block the sale of 
the photos 
peter zimmerman a professor of applied sciences at george 
washington university said the pictures made available by 
soyuzkarta a soviet trade organization are among the finest 
unclassified imagery i have ever seen 
a camera focused on an area could probably pick up the placement 
of large vehicles the site of a troop deployment and topographical 
details such as trenches he said individual people would be 
indistinguishable 
the pictures would be very useful for iraqi and us forces 
in the gulf to help determine military information about the other 
side zimmerman said 
but jeffrey richelson author of americas secret eyes in 
space said a skilled photo interpreter is often needed to 
identify objects from satellite pictures 
soyuzkarta is one of three commercial firms that sell satellite 
photographs of the gulf the other two are spot image a 
frenchowned company and landsat a us concern 
spot image says it will sell pictures only to people with 
security clearances to prevent the images from falling into iraqi 
hands landsat says its pictures of the gulf region show only sand 
soyuzkarta says it tries to make sure only legitimate customers buy 
the pictures 
soyuzkartas photographs show items roughly 15 feet in size and 
have the highest resolution among the three companies with 
computer enhancement the images are clearer 
velon minshew of fort worth texas a us distributor for 
soyuzkarta said the company has pictures of saudi arabia kuwait 
and iraq for the months of august and september each frame showing 
an area 5060 square miles sells for 1560 
clark nelson said spot images pictures show a resolution of 
about 30 feet the pictures sell for anywhere from 500 to 3000 
generally the landsat pictures of the gulf region show a lot 
of sand cording to dick mroczynski a company spokesman 
landsats pictures much less clear than those of soyuzkarta and 
spot were designed as a mapping tool and are often used by 
geologists and others trying to determine land formations 
under un sanctions the commercial satellite companies are 
barred from selling pictures to iraq 
minshew refused to say who has purchased soyuzkartas pictures 
but the company will sell to legitimate organizations who agree not 
to transfer the information 
nelson of spot image said his company sells photographs to the 
defense department we are not selling to the iraqis or anybody 
associated with the iraqis he said and only those with proper 
security procedures are allowed to purchase the pictures 
nelson said he knew nothing of a recent report in the washington 
times that said iraq is believed to have obtained satellite 
pictures indirectly from spot image the newspaper cited us 
intelligence sources as its source 
television networks have not made wide use of the satellite 
pictures although cbs 60 minutes program showed a photograph 
purporting to show a uranium mine in iraq an interpreter pointed 
out the images 
spokesmen for cbs abc nbc and cnn said their networks were not 
using other gulf pictures 
john stack the foreign assignment editor at nbc said the 
network has used satellite pictures in the past to show among 
other things the nuclear explosion at chernobyl in the soviet 
union 
electronic images provided by commercial satellites are not 
nearly as sophisticated as the data sent by intelligence 
satellites richelson said

belgium has ordered an investigation 
into the activities of a secret group formed during the cold war to 
fight potential communist invaders in several nato countries an 
official said friday 
defense minister guy coeme said his government suspected the 
littleknown group might be linked to a series of murders around 
brussels between 1983 asnd 1985 
the inquiry was launched after speculation was raised in italy 
that the italian branch of the organization known as operation 
gladio might have orchestrated rightwing terrorism 
the anticommunist groups were organized in the 1950s and 
operated in several other countries of the north atlantic treaty 
organization including greece and portugal 
they set up information and communication networks and also had 
a special sabotage division to be put to se in case of a communist 
invasion officials of both italy and belgium said 
cells of the secret network were active in portugal during the 
1950s to defend the rightist government of dictator antonio 
oliveira salazar according to a radio report in lisbon on friday 
the greek defense minister yannis varvitsiotis said friday the 
cia helped set up a similar network in greece in 1955 to organize a 
guerrilla war against any communist invader known as operation 
sheepskin it was dismantled by 1988 he said 
prime minister wilfried martens who has headed the belgian 
government almost continuously since 1979 said he was never 
informed of the existence of the belgian arm of the group which he 
said was set up by the belgian military 
it was not an official network martens told a news 
conference friday 
he said however that nato knew of the groups activities 
although they were not an official part of the organization 
this network is a complete anachronism we favor abolishing 
it martens said 
italy has asked nato to investigate whether the secret groups 
are still needed 
nato spokesman florent swijsen declined comment on the groups 
saying natos established practice on matters of military 
secrecy is not to provide information or to comment in any way 
coeme said operation gladio cell officials met in brussels two 
weeks ago to see whether it was still useful to have this kind of 
service considering the growing eastwest cooperation 
in italy speculation abounds that the group was involved in 
rightwing terrorism during the 1970s and 1980s however italian 
premier giulio andreotti said thursday he had no evidence that any 
crimes were committed in operation gladio 
belgium is investigating whether it was involved in a series of 
supermarket attacks and robberies that left at least 28 people dead 
between 1983 and 1985 
the attackers were always more bent on killing than stealing 
the violent incidents have often been linked by authorities to 
rightwing terrorism police have made little progress in the case

a cyanide leak into a river in the soviet 
republics of byelorussia and latvia has poisoned water supplies to 
several cities and caused at least two people to become ill 
officials said friday 
the leak into the daugava river apparently from a chemical 
weapons plant occurred sometime between oct 31 and nov 5 said 
authorities in the two republics 
they said officials of the plant which makes chemicals for use 
in chemical weapons never told them about the leak 
it is just the same as chernobyl we only learned that 
something went wrong when we saw fish floating belly up down the 
stream said latvian deputy prime minister ilmar bisher he 
referred to the 1983 nuclear power plant disaster in the nearby 
ukraine 
two men ate a fish and got minor poisoning we hope there 
will be no more cases said bisher head of a latvian commission 
investigating the leak 
local officials were still testing the waters and trying to 
determine how much of the chemical had leaked 
some say it was only three tons other reports mention up to 
60 tons said mayor andris inkulis of riga the capital of the 
latvian republic 
drinking water from the river was turned off in riga on 
thursday said viktor yukhno the controller at latvias government 
water authority the city of nearly 1 million gets onethird of its 
water from the river officials said 
the citys residents have been using water from underground 
wells and a lake but pumps are not powerful enough to bring water 
to taller buildings and many residents remain without water yukhno 
said 
bisher said rigas water reservoir was also contaminated and it 
may take 10 days for river water supplies to be restored 
this does not only affect riga but the whole republic of 
latvia inkulis said in stockholm sweden where he was 
visiting we warned people over television and radio so they 
could save some water 
water also was cut to daugavpils a city of 150000 about 120 
miles east of riga bisher said officials have trucked in water 
for the city and other areas 
daugavpils gets threequarters of its water from the daugava 
but much of the contamination already has passed and water may be 
turned back on by saturday he said 
the chemicals apparently leaked from the plant in the 
byelorussian town of novopolotsk 480 miles upriver from riga just 
over the republics border 
we think the poison comes from the weapons factory but they 
dont tell us anything inkulis said if only we had been told 
when this happened right away but we werent and now the poison 
runs out into the sea 
there was no word on the leak from plant officials or the state 
press bisher said the plant is operated by the national 
governments chemical and petrochemical ministry 
preliminary analysis showed the chemical was either hydrogen 
cyanide or potassium cyanide inkulis said 
it was not clear how the leak occurred 
it was impossible to determine how many people were affected in 
latvia or byelorussia because many have begun using well water in 
recent years 
riga is the largest city on the river lying at its mouth on the 
baltic sea but hundreds possibly thousands of other people live 
in areas along the river and traditionally used the river for food 
and drinking water

the leading antianxiety drug has become the 
first medication approved for panic disorder officials said 
friday 
an estimated 3 million americans 1 percent to 2 percent of the 
population will suffer from panic disorder in their lifetimes 
for more than half of them it will disrupt their social and 
working lives 
the illness is characterized by repeated panic attacks in which 
a patient is struck by intense fear by avoiding situations 
associated with the attacks some sufferers become housebound or 
are unable to go outside alone 
symptoms of the attacks can include chest pain shortness of 
breath dizziness trembling and sweating nausea and abdominal 
distress the symptoms often mimic a heart attack which can lead 
to an incorrect diagnosis said officials of the upjohn co which 
makes xanax 
the food and drug administration first approved xanax in 1981 
for the treatment for clinical anxiety and anxiety associated with 
depression 
common side effects of xanax in panic disordersufferers include 
sedation and fatigue but as is the case with anxiety treatment 
those reactions eased when the dose was reduced or as the 
medication was continued upjohn said 
however because higher doses of xanax may be needed for longer 
periods of time to treat panic disorder the fda was concerned 
about the potential for dependency on the drug 
at higher doses and longer duration there is potential for 
physical dependency on xanax and withdrawal symptoms when the drug 
is stopped or reduced too rapidly said fda spokeswoman eva 
kemper 
because of that possibility xanax must be withdrawn gradually 
and under a physicians supervision she said 
a biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is believed to cause 
panic attacks the company said xanax known generically as 
alprazolam can block the attacks by interacting with several 
different systems in the brain 
upjohn studied alprazolam as a treatment for the disorder in a 
twophase study that involved more than 1700 patients in more than 
14 countries the company said

workers pulling down a slate chalkboard in an 
elementary school found buried treasure chalk drawings elementary 
school children had done a halfcentury earlier 
the workers were preparing to cover the walllength chalkboard 
with a bulletin board at concord elementary school tuesday they 
noticed the slate was loose pulled it off and found a farewell 
from the 6a graduating class of 1938 
further investigation turned up more artwork beneath another 
chalkboard apparently left behind by someone who couldnt bear to 
erase them when new slates were installed over the worn ones 52 
years before 
the walllength boards included six stillvivid colored chalk 
pictures by student artists and the signatures of several dozen 
children who attended lily lodmells class 
one of the names was of a now 64yearold construction worker 
who lives lives a few blocks away 
thats me no 17 thats my signature carl marra 
exclaimed when he was summoned to the school 
marra whose name was signed marro then a birth certificate 
error he later corrected is a lifelong resident of the south park 
neighborhood marra said he did not remember doing the blackboard 
farewell but added i remember most of the kids we all lived on 
the same street 
several of his longago classmates still live in the area he 
said 
the chalk pictures are drawings of scenes in norway portugal 
and italy on one board and holland sweden and mexico on another 
the rooms present teacher bernice moore said her thirdgrade 
students were very excited by the discovery they talked about 
what they must have been studying at the time probably about 
those countries 
principal toby gonzales informed the seattle school districts 
archives office of the find and taped off the area to protect it 
while plans were made to put it on display in a hallway or

one final cliffhanger congressional 
race remained in limbo friday a day after another close race ended 
with an incumbent conceding defeat 
democratic rep jim bates of san diego trailed republican 
challenger randy cunningham by 982 votes in the 44th district with 
an unknown number of absentee ballots still to be counted the san 
diego county registrar of voters said they would not be tabulated 
until tuesday 
bates who was seeking a fifth term had been reprimanded by the 
house ethics committee last year for sexually harassing two female 
aides 
on thursday democratic rep douglas bosco of sebastopol 
acknowledged he had lost a bid for a fifth term to republican 
developer frank riggs 
bosco trailed riggs by 1973 votes with an unknown number of 
absentee ballots still uncounted but an aide said the congressman 
didnt believe those votes would change the outcome 
riggs tried to take advantage of the national savings and loan 
scandal claiming that bosco had become a wealthy man by 
consorting with scoundrels who ran two local failed sampls 
but boscos downfall seemed to be due to a strong showing by 
peace and freedom party candidate darlene comingore who appealed 
to liberals dissatisfied with boscos positions on environmental 
and foreign policy issues comingore got nearly 15 percent of the 
vote 
boscos loss leaves the makeup of the newly elected congress at 
267 democrats 166 republicans and one independent with bates 
seat still undecided if bates loses the result would be a net 
gain of eight seats for the democrats and a loss of nine for the 
gop 
in california democrats held 27 of the states 45 house seats 
before the election and the republicans held 18 if bates loses 
democrats will hold 26 seats and the republicans 19

the presidents of estonia latvia and lithuania on 
friday asked countries planning to sign the most comprehensive arms 
control treaty in history not to legitimize the soviet unions 
claim to the baltic states 
they also said at a summit in vilnius the lithuanian capital 
that their states should be separately identified in the 
conventional forces in europe treaty 
the accord covers weapons and troops in europe from the atlantic 
ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union and is to be the 
centerpiece for a 34nation summit nov 1921 in paris 
the treaty covers deployment of tanks antiaircraft artillery 
and other nonnuclear arms in four european zones including the 
baltics 
the three presidents said treaty signatories should explicitly 
state that lithuania estonia and latvia were never legally 
incorporated into the soviet union 
presidents vytautas landsbergis of lithuania arnold ruutel of 
estonia and anatoly gorbunov of latvia asked signatories to 
refrain from legitimizing the presence of or any additions to the 
soviet armed forces on their the baltics territory 
silence on this issue might be construed by the soviet union 
as tacit recognition of the forcible incorporation of the baltic 
states into the soviet union 
in an appeal reported by baltic news services the leaders said 
the baltics should be separately identified in the treaty so they 
could control its implementation on their territory 
lithuania estonia and latvia together have a population of 8 
million people the three states are in various stages of drives to 
break out of the soviet union which annexed them in 1940 in a deal 
with nazi germany 
the baltic presidents failed in their bid to be invited to the 
paris summit as observers but landsbergis told a news conference 
friday we hope to participate in the conference at least as 
guests of a delegation of one of the countries that takes part

mary robinson a feminist lawyer elected 
as the first woman president in irelands history on friday 
thanked the countrys womn who instead of rocking the cradle 
rocked the system 
i dont know whether to dance or to sing i have done both and 
i hope to do more she said after being declared the winner of a 
traditionshattering presidential campaign 
mrs robinson finished with 528 percent of the vote overtaking 
former deputy prime minister brian lenihan the nominee of the 
dominant fianna fail party in the second round of counting 
the 46yearold attorney and professor of law was the first 
woman elected president and the first to beat fianna fail in a 
contested presidential election 
we were up against the might and the money and the very 
effective machine of the greatest political party in this country 
and we beat them said mrs robinson 
she pledged to work for the poor the homeless the sick and the 
unemployed and above all the women of ireland who are still 
struggling in the long march to equality and equity 
to all those who have no voice or whose voice is weak i say 
take heart there is hope 
look what you did in this election you made history 
her support she said came from men and women of all parties 
and none by many with great moral courage who stepped out from the 
faded flags of the civil war and voted for a new ireland and above 
all by the women of ireland the women of ireland who instead of 
rocking the cradle rocked the system 
by tradition irelands presidents are above politics and mrs 
robinson had acknowledged that winning would mean an end to the 
battles she had fought to legalize divorce and contraception and 
to make information available on abortion 
she has said that she intends to open the sprawling presidential 
mansion to an array of interest groups that invitation was open 
she said even to the protestants of northern ireland who reject 
any thought of unifying the island 
mrs robinson will be inaugurated dec 3 succeeding patrick 
hillery who must retire after serving two sevenyear terms 
prime minister charles haughey congratulated mrs robinson and 
pledged his support but her victory was an embarrassment for his 
party and prompted talk of a challenge to his leadership 
lenihan led with 441 percent of the vote to 389 percent for 
mrs robinson after the first round of counting since neither had 
a majority the result turned on the second choices of the 17 
percent who had voted for austin currie the fine gael partys 
nominee 
nearly 85 percent of that vote went to mrs robinson who is an 
independent but was nominated by the labor and workers parties 
the two parties had combined for only 147 percent of the vote 
in last years parliamentary elections and mrs robinson was the 
first candidate from the left to win a presidential campaign 
fianna fail had monopolized the office since 1945 
the irish press traditionally a fianna fail supporter said the 
election signals a change in irish society and a shift away from 
traditional attitudes and allegiances 
in 20 years in the irish senate and as an attorney mrs 
robinson battled church and state in efforts to legalize divorce 
and contraception in irelands deeply conservative society she 
was regarded as a radical 
she won court cases to permit women to serve on juries to 
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality to restore inheritance 
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators the 
same pension rights as their male colleagues 
contraceptives were made available by law to bona fide 
couples in 1979 and in 1985 to anyone over 18 however the ban 
on divorce was upheld in a national referendum in 1986 
mrs robinson says she personally opposes abortion but she 
recently represented students who sought to distribute information 
about the availability of abortion in britain 
raised as a roman catholic she defied her parents by marrying a 
protestant nick robinson a fellow student at trinity college 
robinson took three months off from his own legal practice to 
work in the campaign which had been launched only after a 
favorable vote from their three children tessa 18 william 16 
and aubrey 9

a national organization that has 
represented young farmers for more than a half century is making 
changes to adapt to an era of farmers with business suits and mbas 
who work with computerized tractors 
but some fear the spirit of the traditional farmer may be lost 
in the shuffle 
two years ago to keep up with the times future farmers of 
america updated its name to the national ffa organization 
this week delegates at the organizations 63rd annual 
convention voted to reword the farmers fourparagraph 
agriculture education and citizenship creed to reflect changes 
in the industry 
among the changes they replaced the future of farming with 
the future of agriculture and rural america with 
american agriculture 
agriculture has changed in many ways said c coleman 
harris the ffa national executive secretary the farm operator 
has so many different people to deal with 
harris said the ffa was attempting to broaden a spotlight 
formerly focused only on farmers to encompass engineers 
biotechnicians business specialists and computer scientists 
there are so many others that need to get under that 
umbrella harris said 
but some members think changing the creed is going too far 
they are cutting out the words farmer and the basis of 
farming said david bowles 15 an ffa member from sarasota fla 
eric frederick 27 an agriculture teacher at marion county 
technical center in farmington wva said he would rather see a 
new emphasis that incorporates changes in the industry without 
ignoring the old values 
i dont agree with all of it he said of the changes 
still it was difficult to find anyone among the more than 
20000 members at the convention who said he was a farmer the 
crowd was full of future veterinarians businessmen and women and 
fertilizer experts 
kevin stone 17 from onita ill works parttime in a grocery 
store while he prepares for a career as a businessman dealing in 
fertilizer and crops 
its not really the farming industry stone said there 
are lots of jobs you can get without having a farming background 
even members who fit the mold of the traditional farmer 
acknowledged the changes technology has meant for farming 
mark stalder 17 of junction city kan was raised on his 
familys ranch without computers he said working with new 
computerized tractors was like being born again 
stalder said he is taking courses in horticulture crop 
production and animal and environmental science to prepare for his 
career as a farmer 
but despite his fancy education he said his parents wont have 
any trouble keeping him on the ranch 
i was born there and i plan on living there for the rest of 
my life he said

a un panel rebuked iraq on friday by 
unanimously refusing to consider a resolution that would have 
denounced the us military buildup in the persian gulf 
the iraqi motion said the gulf crisis began aug 7 when us 
forces began arriving in saudi arabia to counter iraqs army 
iraqs draft did not even mention kuwait which it overran on aug 
2 and has declared is its 19th province 
us ambassador thomas r pickering called the iraqi attempt to 
introduce the general assembly resolution illfounded 
tendentious and mendacious 
pickering noted that kuwait and saudi arabia invited washington 
to send troops to defend them the un charters article 51 allows 
nations to defend themselves against aggression either alone or 
with allies 
the iraqis tried to introduce the motion in the assemblys 
general committee a 29member panel with broad geographic 
representation the committee assigns items to the agenda and 
considers requests for new resolutions 
iraqi delegate adnan ahmed mohammed said he had rewritten his 
speech to the committee since thursday when president bush ordered 
200000 more us troops be sent to the gulf to give the 
international force opposing iraq an adequate offensive military 
option 
the american move will nearly double the current us strength 
there are now 230000 us military personnel in the region allies 
from 26 other countries have sent about 70000 of their own 
soldiers 
iraq has deployed an estimated 430000 soldiers in kuwait and 
southern iraq since invading its oilrich neighbor in a dispute 
over land oil and money 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said a new 
security council resolution authorizing the use of military force 
would make the us military buildup legal under the un charter 
if it is in the context of article 42 even though i would regret 
any recourse to force it would be legitimate he said 
diplomats in new york and us officials in washington have 
confirmed the united states has prepared a resolution that would 
authorize force under article 42 but is waiting to introduce it 
until secretary of state james a baker iii has lined up enough 
support among us allies on the security council 
mohammed the iraqi delegate said bush and us defense 
secretary dick cheney blew the horns of war in announcing the 
dispatch of new americans troops he called it proof of the 
aggressive schemes against iraq and the arab nation 
are we approaching a catastrophe are we expecting a tragedy 
to take place mohammed asked 
he accused the united states of thwarting any attempts at an 
arab diplomatic solution he said washington had ignored iraqi 
president saddam husseins aug 12 proposal that an iraqi 
withdrawal be linked to establishment of a palestinian homeland 
bush has rejected any specific conditions for an iraqi 
withdrawal from kuwait but he has said other issues in dispute 
could be discussed after a pullout 
in a scornful voice kuwaiti ambassador mohammad a abulhasan 
rejected the proposed iraqi resolution he said it was the iraqi 
regime that launched an unjustified unprovoked attack against 
kuwait 
other delegates who assailed the iraqi proposal were from saudi 
arabia the united arab emirates britain senegal czechoslovakia 
france honduras and canada

secretary of state james a baker iii on friday 
neared the end of a trip seeking support for possible military 
action against iraq confident that saudi arabia egypt and other 
arab forces would fight alongside us troops but less certain 
about france 
a senior official on the trip said it was still unclear where 
the french would be he commented as baker headed into the trips 
final leg which included talks with british prime minister 
margaret thatcher on friday and french president francois 
mitterrand on saturday 
he was also to meet in paris with french foreign minister roland 
dumas who said in advance of the visit the effort of france is 
real and secondlargest after the usa this is very clear 
between the americans and us 
thatcher a staunch supporter said after her meeting with 
baker obviously we stand absolutely together 
she said no further un authority would be needed to take 
military action against kuwait but that she would back any us 
move for additional support from the world body 
referring to the nations arrayed against iraq on the issue of 
kuwait she said we obviously would like to keep this coalition 
together and so we are considering how best to do that 
baker said before leaving moscow for london on friday that the 
soviets were disappointed with the results of their overtures to 
iraq and were no more optimistic than the united states about 
president saddam hussein reversing his invasion of kuwait 
after soviet president mikhail s gorbachev sent a special 
emissary to baghdad in september and again last month reports 
surfaced in moscow that hopes of a negotiated settlement had been 
raised 
but baker effectively deflated such a hopeful impression of 
yevgeny primakovs mission 
i dont think the soviets are any more optimistic than we are 
about the willingness of saddam hussein to leave kuwait baker 
said 
the senior us official commenting on condition of anonymity 
said primakov was basically stiffed by iraq 
and yet the official said of saddam everybody knows he has 
the capability to do a 180degree turnabout on short notice 
but i dont know whether his antennae will be set in a 
receive mode or not the official said weve seen no 
evidence in all of the diplomatic activity thats taken place 
weve seen no evidence on the part of saddam hussein to even begin 
to comply with the united nations resolutions 
he added that gorbachev shares that view 
nearing the end of bakers eightday mission to seven countries 
the official said troops from saudi arabia egypt and arab states 
in the persian gulf would fight alongside american forces in the 
event of a war to liberate kuwait 
he said syrias participation as well as frances was 
uncertain 
despite a judgment that syria fosters terrorism the bush 
administration has tried to engage president hafez assad in the 
alliance against saddam the syrian leader offered up to 15000 
troops but only about a third were sent to saudi arabia where 
most of the allied force is deployed 
the senior official said however that syria might end up 
leading the charge against iraq 
assad and saddam hussein head rival factions of the baathist 
party and are bitter rivals syria stood alone among the larger 
arab states in backing nonarab iran in its eightyear war with 
iraq 
when baker left washington last saturday one of his goals was 
to see whether the four nations who are permanent members of the 
un security council along with the united states would support a 
resolution authorizing the use of force as a last resort to evict 
iraq from kuwait 
baker on tuesday gained the acquiescence of chinese foreign 
minister qian wichen and a reluctant commitment on thursday from 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
mrs thatchers consent was a cinch but mitterrand who has 
been urging a negotiated settlement may be difficult to convince 
baker sees him saturday in paris 
in light of the lukewarm reception on the journey baker said 
thursday night he was not on a decisionmaking trip on friday he 
said no resolution to use force was being prepared 
gorbachev meanwhile has urged that saddam be approached 
through some kind of arab mechanism and he said recently there 
were now more arguments than ever in favor of saving the 
situation by using the arab factor 
on another subject baker said a treaty to cut nonnuclear 
weapons in europe still was not finished he said the main problem 
was failure to reach agreement with the soviet union on methods of 
verifying adherence to the treatys provisions and how the casts of 
inspection would be apportioned 
president bush has said unless the conventional forces in europe 
treaty was ready to be signed he would not attend a 34nation 
summit meeting in paris nov 1921 
another nagging problem has concerned the forces the soviets 
would be permitted to keep in the areas of leningrad and kiev 
baker and shevardnadze agreed on terms near the end of their 13 
hours of talks thursday night

the justice department has dropped a plan to 
stop homeless people from sleeping on a steam grate just yards from 
the street entrance to the office of attorney general dick 
thornburgh 
workers recently removed a partially constructed fence around 
the steam grate the fence drew protests in september from homeless 
people and their advocates 
the day of the protest someone drove off with the iron gate 
which had not been installed by workmen 
until this week the fence had stood without the gate that 
allowed homeless people to continue to sleep atop the grate which 
covers a vent to a steam tunnel that runs between the justice 
department and several adjacent government buildings 
workmen planted holly bushes around the grate before removing 
the uncompleted fence 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said the fence was to 
be installed as a security measure 
the attorney general never thought it was a good idea 
eramian said adding that thornburgh didnt know about plans to 
build it until the day of the protest 
a department source speaking on condition of anonymity said an 
alternative measure had been taken to prevent anyone from entering 
the steam tunnel

raisa gorbachev stepped out of the sleek 
black limousine friday and she soon disappeared into an army of 
photographers 
instead of getting a good look at one of the worlds most famous 
women many wellwishers went home grumbling about freedom of the 
press 
this is scandalous yelled an elderly lady struggling to see 
mrs gorbachev 
its not right the press gets to see raisa and we ordinary 
people dont said the woman who would only identify herself as 
gisela 
a police officer trying to clear a path for mrs gorbachev 
shrugged and said thats freedom of the press 
freedom for whom not for us the woman retorted 
mrs gorbachev visited linz a picturesque little city on the 
rhine river while her husband soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev was meeting about 20 miles away in bonn with chancellor 
helmut kohl 
her rousing welcome reflected her husbands immense popularity 
in germany 
the side trip by mrs gorbachev was announced at the last 
moment city officials got just a few hours notice 
we were driving down the autobahn and heard about this on the 
radio said one onlooker helmut bittner of leverkusen 
of course we would rather see mikhail but this visit is 
important too said bittner 
with mrs gorbachev about to arrive bittner exuded enthusiasm 
for the soviet leader saying kohl should promise plenty of 
financial aid to gorbachev 
we cannot forget we have gorbachev to thank for unification 
said bittner 
its in our interest that the soviet union remains stable how 
would anyone feel if we woke up tomorrow and a general had taken 
gorbachevs place said bittner 
he was in a crowd of several hundred standing in nearfreezing 
air on the square in front of linzs 600yearold city hall 
mrs gorbachevs zil limousine showed up about 40 minutes late 
despite the delay the throng remained in the hope of seeing her 
when her car finally arrived she surprised everyone by telling 
her chauffeur to stop short of the city hall dressed in a grey 
winter coat mrs gorbachev went right to the throng showing some 
of her husbands celebrated zest for working the crowd cheers rang 
out 
but a legion of photographers and camera teams soon engulfed 
her security men shoved photographers and reporters aside who in 
turn fell against mrs gorbachevs wellwishers or stepped on their 
toes 
mrs gorbachev then disappeared inside the city hall where she 
signed linzs guest book 
most of her most ardent admirers however were stuck outside

government lawyers urged a federal appeals court 
friday to reverse an important insider trading ruling because it 
would hamper their ability to prosecute certain securities 
violations 
the arguments before the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
followed a decision overturning the conviction of a stockbroker 
charged with trading on inside information about the 1986 takeover 
of the waldbaum supermarket chain 
federal prosecutors have asked the court to reverse the ruling 
which found there was insufficient evidence to show that the 
information the broker received from a member of the waldbaum 
family was confidential 
we believe this will open a gaping hole by providing an 
essential safe harbor of trading by family members sec attorney 
paul gonson said 
gonsons presentation included a lively debate with one of the 
judges over why the sec had never fully defined insider trading 
why doesnt the sec promulgate a rule that tells all of us 
what you think insider trading is asked judge jon o newman 
how are the people in the investment community supposed to 
know 
gonson said the sec had tried to formulate a definition but had 
failed 
the commission attempted this over a long period of time but 
decided it was better to leave it to be developed on a casebycase 
basis gonson said 
all 12 judges of the court sat friday to consider reversing the 
21 decision issued may 2 by three of their other colleagues the 
hearing called an en banc proceeding is the last vehicle of 
appeal in the federal judiciary before a case is taken to the us 
supreme court 
the appeals court did not issue a decision friday 
chestman a former broker with gruntals amp co was convicted 
last year of a series of crimes as a result of trades the 
government said he made after receiving privileged information 
about aampps takeover of waldbaum inc 
the government had charged that chestman learned of the planned 
takeover from one of his clients keith loeb a nephew by marriage 
to waldbaums founder ira waldbaum 
evidence at trial showed that loeb learned about the deal from 
his wife who in turn heard it from her mother who was told by her 
brother ira waldbaum 
chestmans attorney elkan abramowitz said the earlier decision 
should stand because there was no proof to show that chestman knew 
loeb was privy to the companys business secrets 
not every conversation in a family situation is a breach of 
fiduciary duty if revealed abramowitz said in absence of a 
breach of fiduciary duty there can be no fraud 
assistant us attorney david brodsky however claimed that all 
the waldbaum family members in the chain of communication knew the 
information about the takeover was confidential and that chestman 
too knew he was breaking the law 
chestman knew exactly what was happening he was getting 
nonpublic information from loeb brodsky said

germany marked the anniversary of the berlin 
walls collapse friday but some among the shivering crowds at 
ceremonies said the joy of the event had faded because of pressing 
economic problems 
friday was also the 52nd anniversary of the nocturnal rampage 
against jewish homes businesses and synagogues that foreshadowed 
the holocaust in east berlin about 3000 jews attended a 
commemoration of the nov 9 1938 crystal night pogrom named for 
the shattered glass left by nazi thugs 
a monument to german reunification a fourfootsquare section 
of the dismantled wall was unveiled at one of the border crossing 
points where thousands of east germans streamed across last year in 
unheardof freedom 
the monument was inscribed with the message berliners came 
together again 
but in contrast to the wild celebrations that began 
spontaneously on nov 9 1989 events for the first anniversary 
drew smallish crowds newspapers printed sober editorials about the 
problems of unemployment in the economically stunted former 
communist part of germany which officially united oct 3 
its true a whole new world has opened up for us said east 
berliner erika brut one wants to celebrate but there are so 
many problems 
she and her husband thorsten brut 42 a teacher were among a 
few hundred people shivering in nearfreezing weather late friday 
on marxengels square in east berlin to watch a documentary of last 
years wall opening 
looking at the pictures it all seems so long ago our lives 
have changed completely in the last 12 months brut said 
the main symbol of the former division of berlin and germany 
the brandenburg gate was busy with a fleamarket atmosphere of 
rows of tables offering everything from soviet army caps to chips 
of the wall for sale 
but the wall on which last years celebration occurred is gone 
six sections of it stand on a nearby square so visitors can see 
what it looked like 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev whose policies allowed 
the soviet client governments of eastern europe to crumble was 
greeted friday in bonn with a heros welcome 
gorbachev and chancellor helmut kohl signed a 20year treaty of 
friendship and cooperation grateful german leaders said they hoped 
they could help gorbachev solve the soviet unions desperate 
problems 
berlins jewish community for the first time held its main 
commemoration of crystal night in the splendid ryke street 
synagogue in a workingclass neighborhood of east berlin 
heinz galinski leader of the central council of german jews 
said the significance of the walls opening remains a halftruth 
if it conceals the earlier imprinted meaning of the date 
and halftruths are not a good foundation for building a 
healthy future 
galinski said germans have never acknowledged fully the horrible 
events that started on kristallnacht six million jews had died by 
the time world war ii ended in 1945 and germany lay in ruins and 
partition 
germany had 540000 jews before the war but only 30000 now 
galinski said he recalled the words of gen lucius d clay one of 
the american military commanders in berlin democracy in germany 
will be measured by the extent jews can live there 
west berlin mayor walter momper unveiling the wall monument at 
bornholmer bridge also referred to the memory of crystal night 
but concentrated on the immediate past and the future 
for germans nov 9 1989 was the happiest day in the postwar 
era those who witnessed it will never forget said the social 
democrat 
momper will share the mayoralty with his east berlin 
counterpart tino swierzina until elections on dec 2 when unified 
germany holds its first parliamentary elections 
the bundesrat the upper house of germanys parliament met in 
berlin on friday for the first time in 31 years joined by newly 
elected representatives from the five eastern states created when 
east germany joined the west 
the rapid pace toward unification has thrust the nation into a 
host of new problems lawmakers are faced with rising unemployment 
in former east germany and claims on property by germans who fled 
before the wall was erected in 1962 
the subject of who deserves credit for the spontaneous opening 
of the wall is still a point of debate 
while east germanys former communist rulers have claimed some 
responsibility it was not clear whether their nov 9 decision to 
permit freedom of travel meant freedom to emigrate permanently or 
also permission to have unhindered contact with the west 
last week a report in the former official communist newspaper 
neues deutschland said mediumlevel security officers decided on 
their own to let the pressing crowds through the wall fearing 
border guards would be killed otherwise 
it was the thousands of east berliners who gathered at the 
border crossing and demanded to be let through momper said 
the power of the individual defeated the system of oppression in 
former east germany

washington p a former cia station chief testified friday to 
a federal grand jury about his involvement in the secret contra 
resupply operation of former white house aide oliver north 
joseph fernandez was subpoenaed by irancontra prosecutors who 
are trying to piece together the precise roles in the affair played 
by ronald reagan george bush and key officials at the cia the 
state department and the pentagon 
reagan and bush have said they didnt know north was overseeing 
a private resupply network during a congressional ban on us 
military aid to the nicaraguan rebels in 1985 and 1986 independent 
counsel lawrence walsh is trying to determine if their denials are 
truthful say sources outside the irancontra prosecutors office 
who are familiar with the fouryear investigation 
mary belcher a spokeswoman for walshs office refused to 
comment on fernandezs appearance or on any aspect of the probe 
tom wilson a lawyer representing the former cia station chief 
also declined to comment 
fernandez was compelled to testify under a court order granting 
him immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony the 
former cia station chief in costa rica had faced criminal charges 
of lying and obstruction to hide his involvement with norths 
operation but the bush administration blocked the case from going 
to trial last year 
in 1985 and 1986 fernandez acted as a gobetween for north and 
the contras fighting in southern nicaragua as the head of cia 
operations in costa rica he passed along information to pave the 
way for air drops of weapons and assisted on an airstrip 
construction project in costa rica that was to be part of the north 
network 
fernandez also discussed the airstrip project with elliott 
abrams the assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
who met frequently with north 
fernandezs cia superiors told congress in 1987 that they hadnt 
been aware of all his activities on behalf of north fernandez 
contradicted them telling congressional investigators he kept the 
agency informed at all times of precisely what he was doing and for 
whom 
if his case had gone to trial fernandez was prepared to show 
that cia stations and facilities in honduras and el salvador were 
all deeply involved in the resupply operation according to 
a recent federal appeals court decision and court papers filed in 
the case 
in court papers fernandez said he would have shown who at the 
cia supported the resupply operation how they did it where they 
did it why they did it and who else at the cia knew about it 
one period walshs investigators are focusing on is october 
1986 according to the sources on oct 5 of that year a resupply 
plane in norths network was shot down over nicaragua triggering a 
political firestorm on capitol hill and threatening to expose the 
operation 
reagan abrams and others in the administration stated 
categorically that the us government had no connection to the 
shotdown flight abrams later said he found out from the cia 
nearly three weeks after the shootdown that there was a us 
government connection to the flight 
walshs grand jury probe began last may north has testified at 
least half a dozen times and former national security adviser john 
poindexter at least twice also testifying was g philip hughes a 
former aide to bush when he was vice president and now us 
ambassador to barbados 
walsh has said the grand jury probe may produce additional 
indictments 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity in 
the scandal but a federal appeals court panel set aside the 
conviction poindexter was convicted in april of conspiracy two 
counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements he 
is appealing six other people have entered guilty pleas or been 
convicted in jury trials in the affair

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
signed an historic nonaggression treaty with united germany on 
friday and won praise from german leaders for his role in the 
peaceful fal of the berlin wall 
gorbachevs first visit to united germany coincided with the 
oneyear anniversary of the opening of the wall and came just five 
weeks after east germany moscows longtime warsaw pact ally 
merged into the new germany 
german chancellor helmut kohl and gorbachev stressed the 
importance of the changes that have allowed closer ties between 
bonn and moscow as they signed the broad agreement that is to serve 
as the basis of future relations 
but the soviet unions huge internal troubles were also part of 
talks between the two leaders 
after a state dinner for gorbachev late friday the head of 
daimlerbenz germanys largest company said emergency deliveries 
of food and clothing to the soviet union may be needed this winter 
everyone is awaiting a very difficult terrible and hard 
winter daimlerbenz chief edzard reuter said of the situation in 
the soviet union there must be immediate help 
in the treaty initialed in moscow on sept 13 both nations 
pledged not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all 
european nations 
we are closing the book on the painful past and clearing the 
way for a new beginning kohl said in a speech at the signing 
ceremony 
after a shortlived alliance germany attacked the soviet union 
at the start of world war ii about 26 million soviets were killed 
the new nonaggression treaty one of three signed friday 
replaces agreements that once linked the soviet union to west 
germany and east germany moscows ties to east germany long 
hindered better relations with bonn 
i have you to thank mr president for the decisive 
contribution so that germany our fatherland could unify on oct 3 
in peace and freedom and in agreement with all its neighbors 
kohl said at a joint news conference with gorbachev 
president richard von weizsaecker said the fall of the berlin 
wall which paved the way for unity would not have been 
possible without gorbachevs political reforms 
earlier in the day gorbachev and his wife raisa stopped to 
chat with a crowd waiting for him outside the governments villa 
hammerschmidt palace next to the rhine river but the crowds were 
far smaller than those that swarmed around the soviet leader during 
his triumphant visit to bonn in june 1989 
still some germans exuded enthusiam for gorbachev and his 
achievements 
we cannot forget we have gorbachev to thank for unification 
said helmut bittner of leverkusen 
its in our interest that the soviet union remains stable how 
would anyone feel if we woke up tomorrow and a general had taken 
gorbachevs place bittner added 
he was in a crowd of several hundred standing in nearfreezing 
air in front of linzs city hall waiting for gorbachevs wife to 
arrive on her own side trip 
the dramatic retreat of communism and the dismantling of the 
iron curtain the past year has radically altered relations between 
the soviet union and germany 
gorbachev relinquished moscows powerful role in german affairs 
this summer when he agreed to a unified germanys membership in 
nato 
germanys western european allies have reacted skeptically to 
the growing relationship between germany and the soviet union 
remembering the devastating consequences of cooperation between 
adolf hitler and joseph stalin 
gorbachev sought to allay such concerns 
the sovietgerman treaty is not directed at anyone our 
agreement and cooperation are part of the ongoing construction of 
the alleuropean house gorbachev said in a speech before the 
treaty was signed 
now gorbachev needs substantial foreign economic assistance to 
bolster his political position and holdthe splintering soviet 
union together 
kohl gave gorbachev a boost saying he wanted the reform policy 
of the soviet union that is linked with the name mikhail s

france commemorated the 20th anniversary of charles 
de gaulles death friday with a respect and affection that eluded 
the former war hero and president in his final years 
throughout the country religious services exhibitions 
symposiums television programs and plays paid tribute to de gaulle 
as leader of french resistance to nazi occupation and founder of 
the current constitutional system with its strong president 
in contrast to his sometimes tempestuous presidency from 1959 to 
1969 de gaulle now is admired by frenchmen of all political 
persuasions 
a poll published thursday in the newspaper le monde said 84 
percent of the respondents believe de gaulles record in office was 
positive 
the nearuniversal admiration contrasts with the generals last 
years when students and workers rioted in the streets 
de gaulles unpopularity culminated in a humiliating defeat at 
the polls in 1969 and drove him from the presidency 
nineteen months later on nov 9 1970 while playing solitaire 
at his home in colombeylesdeuxeglises de gaulle suffered a 
ruptured aneurism and died 
the following afternoon his son philippe went on television to 
announce general de gaulle is dead france is a widow 
only his family close wartime colleagues and villagers attended 
his funeral on nov 12 while dozens of heads of state attended 
ceremonies at notre dame cathedral in paris 
today it is hard to find de gaulle bashers one exception is 
recoursfrance helpfrance an organization of former french 
residents of north africa many of whom lost everything when france 
embarked on decolonization 
for the french from algeria he will forever be regarded as 
the man who betrayed mislead and abandoned us without ever 
pronouncing a single word of compassion for our tragic exodus 
the organization said in a statement friday 
at the start of the algerian revolution de gaulle pledged to 
maintain french rule he later granted independence to end the 
bloodshed 
many ardent leftists have become de gaulle admirers regis 
debray a former adviser to socialist president francois 
mitterrand described de gaulle as the last great man of the 19th 
century and the first great man of the 21st 
in a new book a demain de gaulle tomorrow de gaulle 
debray once a leading exponent of guerrilla warfare and a 
champion of the late che guevara paid homage to the generals 
traditionalist values 
mitterrand himself paid tribute friday sending his army chief 
to lay a wreath at de gaulles tomb in colombeylesdeuxeglises 
exhibitions and documentaries abound including one on de 
gaulles manipulation of the media for political purposes alain 
peyrefitte de gaulles information minister has said de gaulle 
himself edited television newscasts and used the media as an 
instrument of power 
this month also marks the first time de gaulles life and 
achievements have been presented in fiction 
based on a forgotten scenario by william faulkner one of de 
gaulles most fervent admirers director denys granierdeferre has 
made a tv movie recounting the war years 
a lesserknown side of de gaulle is depicted in villa luco 
a play about de gaulles secret visit to elderly ailing marshall 
philippe petain condemned to life imprisonment for collaborating 
with the nazis 
this year also marks the 100th anniversary of de gaulles birth 
and the 50th anniversary of his famed radio appeal from london for 
frenchmen to resist the nazis

the palestine liberation organization on 
friday showed the security council a dramatic videotape of the 
violence on temple mount last month when at least 20 palestinians 
were killed by israeli gunfire 
the grainy film showed palestinians fleeing israeli gunfire on 
the eastern side of the plateau near the al aksa mosque the 
15minute tape was punctuated by gunfire smoke and screams some 
of the 15 council members appeared to grimace at the events 
m nasser alkidwa the plo representative to the united 
nations told the council the tape shows premeditated israeli 
determination to cause the largest possible number of dead and 
wounded among palestinian civilians 
the plo showed the tape to support its call for the security 
council to deploy un military observers to protect palestinians 
in the israelioccupied territories and in east jerusalem 
israel has rejected the demand saying the presence of a un 
observer group in the occupied lands would violate its sovereignty 
alkidwa said the tape was taken by a nonpalestinian neutral 
person a westerner who happened to be in jerusalem the 
photographer was not identified 
alkidwa said the film was shot from the mount of olives facing 
east and did not support israeli charges that the violence was 
provoked by palestinians throwing stones at jews praying at the 
western wall he said it also repudiated israeli charges that the 
violence had been incited by bellicose calls by moslems over 
loudspeakers 
the plo provided what it said were translations from arabic of 
appeals made from the mosque appealing to israeli forces to stop 
firing and to allow amublances doctors and nurses to tend to the 
injured 
restrain yourselves rise to your responsibility if you have 
any sense of reason said one cleric in a mosque 
later soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov told reporters the tape 
was damaging and undermined israels argument that the violence had 
been provoked by palestinians throwing stones at jewish worshipers 
one element was very vivid that there was no planning in the 
movements of the palestinians they were running in all directions 
and that was not some kind of planned attack on the israelis 
and of course the sound the sound of so many shots fired 
that was absolutely unnecessary 
us ambassador thomas r pickering and the israeli envoy had no 
comment 
alkidwa said he hoped the tape would lead to further 
concentration on the means and measure to provide protection 
to the palestinian people 
the violence showed barbarism of police and army personnel 
against our people which cannot be in selfdefense the 
palestinian envoy said 
the security council previously has been the scene of dramatic 
pesentations 
in 1989 panama presented videotape it claimed showed us 
preparations for an attack earlier the united states showed 
photographs of what it said were heavily armed libyan planes that 
were attacked by us warplanes in 1988 
in september 1983 the soviet union displayed a videotape of the 
pilot and control tower conversations before the shootdown of a 
korean airliner that strayed into soviet airspace 
fridays meeting was a continuation of a session that began 
wednesday to discuss the secretarygenerals report on the need to 
protect palestinians in the territories captured by israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
the report did not recommend stationing un observers or 
expanding un observers or other staff in the area 
the council is expected to continue debating the issue for 
several days 
the united states is expected to veto any resolution that calls 
for sending observers to the territories however another possible 
resolution this one calling for a meeting of parties to the fourth 
geneva convention could be accepted by the united states 
the convention calls for humanitarian treatment of civilians in 
time of war israel is a signatory but says the provisions do not 
apply to the occupied territories

highdefinition television a new generation of tv 
with clearer wider images hit the japanese market this week 
years ahead of its scheduled release in other nations 
most major japanese electronics makers introduced new consumer 
hdtv products including televisions videocassette recorders and 
adaptors that allow hdtv broadcasts to be seen on present tv sets 
the new tv sets are at least 10 times as expensive as current 
models however 
sonys 36inch hdtv monitor one of the cheaper models goes for 
the equvalent of 17700 the 32inch toshiba model is priced at 
30700 
in five years we hope to bring that down to about 1 million 
yen 7700 said hideji matsuda of toshibas new media 
division 
hdtv offers extremely detailed images digital sound and wider 
cinemastyle screen proportions until now the equipment was aimed 
at a small number of professionals and was large heavy and 
expensive 
hdtv adaptors for example weighed as much as 209 pounds and 
filled a small cabinet but new models displayed this week by many 
companies weigh as little as 13 pounds and are the size of a large 
cable tv adaptor 
in europe companies have developed a competing hdtv system that 
is not expected to be brought to market until 1992 
in the united states government officials are still debating 
what technical standards to set for hdtv and how it should be 
broadcast 
unlike japan where hdtv signals are broadcast directly from a 
satellite to viewers homes the us federal communications 
commission is exploring a simulcast system in which current 
landbased television stations would broadcast normal programs on 
their present channels and hdtv information on separate channels 
japan broadcasting corp the public television network 
currently broadcasts one hour of hdtv satellite programming a day 
fulltime broadcasting is scheduled to start in early 1992 
although japans hdtv system is not compatibile with current 
equipment with the new adaptors anyone with a regular television 
will be able to tune in hdtv programs although with regular 
picture quality 
hdtv monitors announced by sony matsushita nec toshiba and 
other companies can receive regular japanese tv broadcasts

spending cuts the sale of city assets and 
125 million in new taxes are needed to avoid a virtual shutdown of 
city government and to raise its rockbottom bond rating state and 
local democratic leaders said friday 
the plan announced by mayor w wilson goode state house 
speaker robert w odonnell and other officials also would set up 
an independent control board whose authority would be triggered if 
the city failed to balance future budgets 
the plan represents the critical first step for the citys 
fiscal recovery goode said as a esult of this coming 
together of leadership we now have the elements necessary to solve 
our problems 
no city council members or republicans joined in the 
announcement which left many details sketchy 
other political leaders and bondrating agencies gave the plan 
mixed reviews 
gov robert p casey in harrisburg called the plan an 
important first step he pledged full support of a recommendation 
for an immediate sale of temporary loan notes to avert a cash 
crisis 
it also seems clear that the other recommendations made today 
do not enjoy the same broad consensus as the note sale casey 
added i encourage all participants to continue their discussions 
with elected officials of both parties in a further effort to 
narrow differences and arrive at consensus 
house minority leader matthew ryan a republican from suburban 
delaware county scoffed at such provisions in the plan as a 50 
million increase in state aid 
the plan was drafted behind closed doors in the last two months 
by democratic state and city officials after wall street snubbed 
the citys attempt to float 375 million in temporary loan notes 
the failed note issue resulted in the severe cash crunch that 
would deplete city coffers during december if nothing is done 
the democrats urged a threepronged attack 
the city would issue 250 million to 300 million in temporary 
loan notes with backing from merrill lynch local banks the state 
treasury and the citys pension fund the money would allow the 
city to continue operating and be repaid with tax receipts due in 
the spring 
it would eliminate a 229 million deficit expected by july 1 
by raising 140 million through deficit financing bonds and 90 
million by selling cityowned assets which were not specified 
the citys budget would erase a projected 279 million deficit 
for fiscal 1992 through new taxes higher state and federal aid and 
lower court costs 
the officials urged approval of a 1 percent sales tax they said 
would raise 100 million an unspecified 25 million tax and 9 
million from mandatory withholding of the existing city wage tax 
for city residents who work in the suburbs 
the officials said they had backing from three philadelphia 
congressmen for a 33 million increase in federal aid cuts of 45 
million would come through unspecified mayoral actions and 16 
million would come through improved efficiency in the philadelphia 
courts they said 
bondrating agencies have lowered the citys debt to junkbond 
status the lowest among major us cities the agencies have urged 
city and state leaders to cooperate to find permanent solutions 
hyman c grossman managing director at standard amp poors corp 
said the plan needed republican backing to clear the gopcontrolled 
state senate 
without that theres nothing to comment on he said 
colleen woodell a vice president at fitch investors service 
said the talks had been encouraging but may have fallen short 
dollarwise im not sure it does what they need to have 
done she said i would need to be convinced 
city council passed a precariously balanced 21 billion general 
fund budget may 31 for the fiscal year that began july 1 by 
september a 2064 million deficit was projected because several 
assumptions had turned sour 
major factors included sluggish tax receipts inaction by state 
legislators on citypassed tax measures and arbitrationawarded 
police and firefighter pay increases

friends and doctors said friday they were 
worried that tabloid television and international exposure 
surrounding the sexual assault of a young woman with 46 
personalities will lead to exploitation of the victim 
my concern is she may very well be exploited by everybody as 
she has been before said dr inam haque a psychiatrist at 
winnebago county mental health clinic who has treated the woman 
since 1986 
the 27yearold woman whose name has been withheld by the media 
to protect her identity as a rape victim told the oshkosh 
northwestern she was elated by thursdays verdict 
we did it she said anybody like us myself and the 
insiders her other personalities will be able to get protection 
now 
a winnebago county jury on thursday convicted mark a peterson 
29 of oshkosh of seconddegree sexual assault he faces up to 10 
years in prison when he is sentenced next month 
the jury found the unemployed grocery store bagger who is 
married knew the woman was mentally ill and manipulated one of her 
personalities a naive 20yearold woman who didnt know what 
intercourse was to have sex with him two days after he met her 
wisconsin law forbids sexual contact with mentally ill people 
who cant understand the consequences of their actions 
the victim said her real self only learned of the june 11 
assault because a 6yearold personality was peeking 
peterson maintained after the verdict he did not know the woman 
was mentally ill and was the victim of an overzealous prosecutor 
he promised to appeal 
the womans testimony which often involved her closing her eyes 
and bowing her head as she switched personalities dramatized a 
rare psychiatric diagnosis called multiple personality disorder 
ruth reeves a neighbor and friend said the woman would retain 
a lawyer to help her handle the publicity and requests for 
interviews it appears that everybody wants a piece of the 
action she said 
the television show inside edition announced friday it plans 
to air an interview with the woman next week showing footage of 
the woman switching personalities 
inside edition reporter janet tamaro said the show decided to 
use the interview after consulting with the woman her mother mrs 
reeves and counselors about the consequences of revealing her 
identity 
we were willing to do it any way all of them were willing to 
do it any way they wanted ms tamaro said we really left it 
up to them to decide 
district attorney joe paulus who prosecuted the case said he 
worries the woman may be exploited he said he had nothing to do 
with arranging her interviews with tabloid televisions shows 
she still functions in the community she is capable of making 
everyday decisions on her own she has got to make her own 
decisions in life he said 
the illness often results from childhood abuse that forces the 
sufferer to create multiple personalities to avoid confronting 
reality experts say 
in an interview with the appleton postcrescent the woman said 
she held no grudges against people who doubt her mental illness at 
one point this year she estimated she had 86 personalities but 
many have merged together she said 
the woman born in south korea said she believes her father was 
an american probably a gi she was taken to an orphanage shortly 
after birth 
i had no maternal or paternal care of any kind she told the 
paper i was not touched or picked up except to be changed or 
fed i was a very angry lonely sad baby 
after eight months she was adopted by parents who picked her 
out of a catalog she said her adoptive father physically abused 
her she said he was ill and couldnt help it 
the woman said the multiple personalities began when she was 
still an orphan in south korea

president guillermo endara on friday said 
that journalists wanted to be treated like sacred cows and 
several newspapers excised his name from stories in a dispute over 
press laws 
journalists are demanding an end to the strict laws that were 
carried over from the regime of former dictator manuel antonio 
noriega who was overthrown by the us invasion in december 
the government has used the laws to issue summons to reporters 
who attended an opposition news conference and to arrest on charges 
of criminal slander a columnist who had criticized endara 
organizers of a protest march on thursday vowed to impose the 
law of ice and freeze coverage of the president several 
newspapers and radio stations referred to endara on friday only as 
the president of the republic without mentioning his name 
endara speaking to reporters before leaving friday to attend 
the enthronement of emperor akihito in japan said he was shocked 
by the behavior of reporters who confronted him after thursdays 
march 
endara said he had refused to receive the demonstrators in his 
office because they wanted to enter just because they were 
reporters as if they were the sacred cows of this republic and 
they arent 
that was an uproar of the worst sort the things they 
shouted at me were really outrageous i could not receive or talk 
to any person who shouts in that way he said 
endaras press secretary rene hernandez said the presidents 
policy is to defend freedom of expression but he said 
criticism should not be confused with calumny 
he said if reporters want the laws changed they should petition 
the legislature

us troops stationed in the 
saudi desert say president bush is right to give operation desert 
shield more muscle for a possible attack on iraq 
militarily speaking hes absolutely right air force capt 
patrick ryan 28 of new orleans said friday as he waited for a 
flight at an air base in eastern saudi arabia 
bush on thursday ordered more than 150000 additional troops to 
the persian gulf to join the 230000 us military personnel in the 
region allies from 26 countries have sent another 100000 soldiers 
to join the multinational force deployed after iraq seized kuwait 
on aug 2 
i dont think we have to worry much about the iraqis launching 
an offensive anymore said ryan a fighter pilot the big thing 
right now is how to get those guys out of kuwait and to launch an 
offensive its going to take quite a lot of firepower 
like many servicemen here ryan said he hoped iraqi president 
saddam hussein would pull his troops out of kuwait but that 
usled forces must be prepared if he refuses 
the president said he wanted the allied forces to have an 
adequate offensive military option should global sanctions fail 
to convince saddam to withdraw iraq has deployed an estimated 
430000 troops in kuwait and southern iraq since the invasion 
a ranking us military official in saudi arabia speaking on 
condition of anonymity said if there was a doubt in saddam 
husseins mind about us resolve to use any option required if it 
comes to that this should pretty well clear it up 
army maj frank irons 40 of knoxville tenn a logistics 
expert said he thought more troops would limit casualties in the 
event of war 
i would think the more people the more firepower we get in 
here would enhance our chances if we were to go on the offensive to 
do a quicker job therefore saving a lot of people and limiting the 
casualties that we would probably have he said 
news of the new mobilization was just filtering out to the 
troops in the field 
at the armys 530th supply and services battalion headquarters 
which provides logistics support for thousands of soldiers there 
was some concern in the laundry and bakery about the mobilization 
the only thing im worried about is having to make more 
bread said spec norman wiemken 22 of polo ill who was 
baking some of the 3000 loaves made daily 
just more laundry pvt 1 lawandra hinton 20 of newport 
news va said with a laugh she was sorting through some of the 
12000 pieces of clothing washed at her laundry every day

service station attendant michael hicke 
shot twice in the head lay unnoticed for several hours while some 
customers pumped free gas for themselves 
now police have unveiled a new twist a friend has admitted he 
shot hicke once during an armed robbery then shot him again to end 
his misery when he began making funny noises and gurgling 
brothers emil wisniewski 18 and anton wisniewski 25 were 
charged friday with firstdegree intentional homicide and armed 
robbery in hickes death 
police said the 18yearold victim who worked at a shell gas 
station in the milwaukee suburb of greenfield and two suspects 
had lived in the same neighborhood years ago and were friends 
hickes body was discovered in the stations car wash section 
about 35 yards from the gas pumps about 7 am sunday by a customer 
searching for the attendant 
the customer had pumped gasoline looked for the clerk and found 
him dead with two bullet wounds to the head detective dirk 
wichgers said 
police believe five other customers pumped a total of about 40 
in gas without paying between midnight and 7 am during the hours 
after hicke was believed to have been shot wichgers said 
one of the five left the money in a tray in the attendants 
booth and another returned the following day to pay said station 
owner edward f mcmahon 
according to a criminal complaint the wisniewski brothers 
planned earlier to go to the gas station because there was a lot 
of money there and the guy was supposed to have cocaine in the 
trunk of his car 
but when the two arrived they found hicke was working the shift 
for another employee investigators said the two tried to convince 
hicke to do a fake robbery 
the younger wisniewski and hicke went to the car wash to smoke 
marijuana while the older wisniewski tried to break into the floor 
safe in the attendants booth police said 
after hearing the hammering hicke tried to return to the booth 
the two struggled and the younger wisniewski shot hicke in the 
face investigators said wisniewski returned shortly afterward and 
shot hicke again in the side of the head at pointblank range 
he told police he fired the second shot to make sure he was 
dead because i didnt want him to suffer because he was 
making funny noises and gurgling 
the homicide charge carries a mandatory penalty of life in 
prison and the armed robbery count carries a maximum of 20 years 
mcmahon the station owner said he was perplexed by the actions 
of the customers who pumped gas without paying on the night hicke 
was shot 
youd think there would be more concern about why the person 
is not there mcmahon said thats the only human thing to 
do

four bell telephone companies should be fined 
250000 each for accounting violations that diverted money to 
other telephone companies the federal communications commission 
said friday 
commission officials said telephone customers were not hurt by 
what the companies did 
the fcc sent notices of apparent liability to pacific bell 
southwestern bell new england telephone and new york telephone 
companies receiving such notices are given 30 days to show why they 
should not pay the fine 
the commission also sent a letter of reprimand to the national 
exchange carrier association inc a telephonecompany operated 
entity that collects and distributes the access charges that 
longdistance companies pay local telephone companies to connect 
with the local networks 
the association based in whippany nj distributes access 
charge revenues to the local companies based on revenue and cost 
information reported by these companies the fcc said 
this letter concluded that certain neca directors apparently 
failed to ensure the accuracy of the data reported to neca and that 
the neca board of directors as a whole apparently did not display 
proper vigilance the fcc said 
the apparent violations were discovered during an audit of the 
association 
the bell companies as regulated monopolies are allowed to earn 
only a fixed percentage above the costs of their investments 
currently about 12 percent after all participating companies 
collect their expenses from the common line pool they claim 
profits from whats left over the bell companies make claims 
according to their permitted rates of return whats left over is 
available for the smaller companies 
richard firestone chief of the fccs common carrier bureau 
said the bell companies deliberately reduced their expense claims 
in order to increase the size of the profit pool thus increasing 
the profits available to the smaller companies and boosting their 
rates of return on the investments concerned 
just why the bell companies would want to boost the rates of 
return for other companies by understating their own expenses was 
not clear and the amount of money involved was not stated the 
commission did not immediately release the audit report on which 
its action was based 
firestone would not speculate on the bell companies motives 
but he emphasized that telephone customers did not lose any money 
as a result of the companies actions 
the issue for the fcc firestone said was that the companies 
reporting of their earnings and expenses must be credible 
commissioner andrew c barrett said in an accompanying statement 
that the association board blatantly subverted the commissions 
processes and penalties even though the bell companies appeared 
to have given money away 
barrett said the board intended to manipulate the fccs 
processes to achieve unstated and potentially unlawful ends and 
its intention to deceive commission staff to achieve political or 
other goals cannot go unpunished 
lou saviano spokesman for pacific telephone in san francisco 
said we think theyre just overreacting to what is essentially 
an honest mistake and we think it would be grossly unfair for the 
fcc to penalize us 
we acted on the basis of the best information that was 
available to us with the intent of being fair when they advised us 
we made a mistake we fixed it voluntarily gave the money 
back he said 
nynex spokesman peter goodale reached in new york said the 
companies had cooperated with neca and the fcc in connection with 
the audit but were unaware of any improprieties that the fcc 
believes it may have found 
the fcc also required the association to have an independent 
auditor report to the commission within 180 days on other 
adjustments phone companies reported during 1988 and 1989 and on 
safeguards to prevent future problems

iraqs official newspaper said friday that baghdads foreign 
minister and a former french official held secret talks that led to 
the release of more than 300 french hostages from iraq france 
denied it sanctioned the talks 
former west german chancellor willy brandt flew from baghdad to 
frankfurt friday aboard a german jetliner carrying 174 western 
captives to freedom brandt negotiated the release of the hostages 
who included three americans 
one of the americans was miles hoffman 33 of columbus ga 
shot in the arm sept 5 by iraqi forces in kuwait hoffman was 
whisked off the plane by authorities and taken to the us air force 
regional hospital in wiesbaden german for treatment 
earlier after he was given his boarding documents at baghdads 
airport hoffman told tv cameras good riddance 
a second american don swanke 66 of westlake village calif 
also was taken to the wiesbaden hospital 25 miles outside 
frankfurt for a precautionary checkup said air force capt tom 
gilroy swanke lost 33 pounds in captivity 
the airport rang out with the cheers of the hundreds on hand for 
the arrival as the german jetliner touched down 
relatives who hadnt seen each other since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 wept and embraced as they emerged from the plane 
some held signs reading thank you mr brandt 
brandt told a news conference before leaving baghdad that he was 
carrying proposals for settling the 3monthold persian gulf 
crisis 
western officials have charged that independent efforts by 
governments and former leaders to win release of their nationals 
risks dividing the world alliance against iraq which invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
but speaking in bonn soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on 
friday said no one can drive a wedge into the international 
solidarity 
in washington defense secretary dick cheney said friday that 
american military forces in the gulf will reach up to 430000 
within weeks 200000 more than are now deployed 
cheney said the additional troops would give usallied forces 
the offensive military option to drive iraqi troops from the 
oilrich emirate which it invaded in a dispute over land oil and 
money 
iraqs aljumhouriya newspaper reported meanwhile that iraqi 
foreign minister tariq aziz and former french foreign minister 
claude cheysson met for secret talks endorsed by france 
the daily did not say when or where the meeting between aziz and 
cheysson took place arab sources said the talks set up by the 
palestine liberation organization took place in tunis late last 
month one week before saddam said french nationals were free to 
go 
french foreign minister roland dumas denied that cheysson or 
anyone else had a mandate to negotiate the release of hostages 
freed by saddam in late october france has repeatedly said it made 
no deal with iraq 
the french government did not however deny that the talks took 
place and there was no indication whether they involved a 
diplomatic effort to seek a peaceful solution to the 3monthold 
gulf crisis 
france has made no formal public pledge regarding the 
circumstances under which it would fight iraq saying such 
decisions should be made by the un security council 
the release of the french nationals was interpreted by many 
western officials as an effort by iraq to divide opposition to its 
occupation of kuwait 
but gorbachev during a news conference in bonn said for the 
first time in history we have acted together in so critical a 
situation 
let no one reckon on driving a wedge into that unity he 
said 
secretary of state james a baker iii met friday with british 
officials in london on a weeklong tour of middle eastern and 
european nations to gather support for possible military action 
against iraq 
later prime minister margaret thatcher said london and 
washington stood absolutely together on the gulf crisis baker 
was to meet in paris with french officials on saturday 
in moscow the previous stop on bakers tour a senior us 
official said friday that the moderate arab forces would fight 
alongside us troops to liberate kuwait but he was uncertain that 
france would go along 
i dont know where the french would be the official said on 
condition of anonymity 
several former leaders including edward heath of britain 
yasuhiro nakasone of japan and most recently brandt have 
negotiated freedom for some of the hundreds of hostages in iraq and 
kuwait 
no reason was given for the release of the americans which 
included swankes wife brenda among the other captives about 
1000 americans are still held 
the three had been held among hundreds of others as human 
shields at strategic iraqi sites to deter attack by the 
multinational forces stationed in the gulf region 
hoffman a financial analyst with the kuwaiti government at the 
time of the invasion was shot in the left arm by iraqi troops who 
tried to force their way into his apartment in kuwait city 
there were reports that gangrene developed from the wound and 
the us embassy had placed him on its list of release requests 
twice before hoffmans arm was in a cast and he appeared in pain 
patience with iraq for its invasion of kuwait and its holding of 
western hostages appeared to be growing thin the un trade 
embargo on iraq has not yet pushed iraq into any retreat from the 
emirate 
on thursday the soviet union said for the first time it would 
not rule out military action as a last resort and president bush 
announced there would be new troop deployments without offering 
any figures 
once the added forces are in place america will have more 
troops in the gulf region than it had in europe during the cold 
war about onethird of the armys worldwide force will be in the 
saudi desert 
the additional increment will give us the capacity to 
undertake offensive action should that become necessary cheney 
said friday 
at the united nations an attempt by iraq to introduce a general 
assembly resolution criticizing the us military buildup in the 
gulf drew a stinging rebuke friday when an assembly committee 
unanimously refused to consider it 
us ambassador thomas r pickering called the iraqi attempt to 
introduce a resolution illfounded tendentious and mendacious

death six blacks will seek his release under a government amnesty

sen rudy boschwitz apologized friday for 
a letter sent to some minnesota jews on behalf of his unsuccessful 
reelection campaign suggesting his challenger was not a good jew 
i deeply regret having allowed the letter to be written and 
accept full responsibility for it said boschwitz who is jewish 
paul wellstone who upset the republican senator in tuesdays 
election said he appreciated boschwitzs remarks and accepted his 
apology 
i think it should be the final word said the senatorelect 
who is also jewish 
the letter written by two of boschwitzs jewish supporters and 
signed by them and 70 others was printed on boschwitz campaign 
stationery and mailed at campaign expense nov 1 
wellstone has no connection with the jewish community or our 
communal life the letter said his children were brought up as 
nonjews 
the letter noted that wellstone served as cochairman of the 
rev jesse jacksons 1988 presidential campaign in minnesota and 
said jesse jackson has embraced literally and figuratively 
yasser arafat and has never repudiated that embrace 
moreover wellstone never disassociated himself from any of 
jacksons policies the letter said 
the letter angered wellstones jewish supporters some of whom 
described it as an attempt to split the jewish vote over the issue 
of israel 
two days before the election wellstone said the letter was 
completely unforgivable 
this is making an issue of the fact that we have an 
interreligious marriage said wellstone whose wife is christian 
this is the most sensitive issue in the jewish community there 
is 
boschwitz initially stood by the letter but on friday after 
the star tribune of minneapolis reported that the letter had 
generated angry discussion among jews in israel and the united 
states the senator said he was sorry 
bringing jews and nonjews together has been an important 
element of my public service and private life boschwitz said 
others will judge over time whether i have made a positive 
contribution in this regard but for the moment i simply reiterate 
my apology 
wellstone said boschwitz statement showed a tremendous amount 
of sincerity and conviction 
his remarks are powerful wellstone said it was very 
hurtful to everybody in our family but this is a wonderful 
statement and i think its in the past 
wellstone said he didnt believe the letter was the major reason 
why boschwitz lost the election but he said in the end it was 
very damaging for them

unidentified assailants fired two 
grenades early saurday at the us embassy one day after american 
and philippine panels ended talks on the future of six military 
bases 
there were no injuries in the attack which took place at 650 
am when the embassy was closed one grenade landed in manila bay 
behind the compound and exploded embassy spokesman stanley 
schrager said the other landed in front of the chancery building 
but did not explode he said 
there was no claim of responsibility though the attack was 
similar to one staged last december at an american residential 
area that attack which caused no injuries and minor damage was 
blamed on communist rebels 
at the end of talks friday there were reports the bases future 
would be linked to us aid to the philippines 
the next meeting was set for december spokesmen for both sides 
predicted the talks would be completed by january 
the discussions over the past two days were useful in widening 
the areas of consensus and narrowing the areas still to be 
discussed in more detail us spokesman stanley schrager told 
reporters 
philippine spokesman rafael alunan said the two sides had 
reached no agreements but succeeded in widening the areas of 
consensus and narrowing the areas that still need to be threshed 
out 
on thursday alunan said the us delegation agreed to junk 
the bases agreement and start from ground zero 
alunan did not elaborate but philippine officials have said 
they want any new agreement to cover trade concessions debt relief 
and other issues 
about 50 militant youths held a brief rally near the central 
bank building where the panels met and burned an american flag 
before dispersing peacefully 
in angeles 50 miles north of manila police arrested eight 
leftist students who burned an american flag a few yards from the 
clark air base gate 
the talks centers on the status of clark air base the subic bay 
naval base and four smaller facilities whose lease expires on sept 
16 most philippine politicians have called for phasing out the 
bases although us officials say they want a residual 
american military presence here 
the united states currently maintains about 40000 troops 
military dependents and defense department civilians at the bases 
among the largest on foreign soil the bases and related 
infrastructure provide jobs for scores of thousands of filipinos 
after his arrival wednesday us special negotiator richard 
armitage told foreign secretary raul manglapus that washington 
would remove its 48 combat aircraft and 1800 air force personnel 
from clark air base 
manglapus chief philippine negotiator said last september the 
philippines wanted to take control of clark when the current bases 
agreement expires in september 
philippine officials said they were willing to negotiate the 
status of the subic bay naval base and the other installations 
alunan said the philippines was sticking by its demand for 
sovereign control of the bases by next year 
the six bases are technically philippine installations but are 
effectively under american control 
schrager told reporters friday said the americans wanted a 
transition period to transfer the bases to full philippine control 
and that the timeframe could vary depending on the installation 
on thursday he said the united states would like to maintain 
access to some of these facilities and to maintain a small residual 
american military presence in the country similar to the agreements 
we have with many other countries around the world 
any new agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 
23member philippine senate where opposition to the installations 
is strong 
opinion surveys show most filipinos support the bases but many 
influential figures in government academic circles and media 
oppose them as an infringement on sovereignty

westminster college where winston churchill 
first warned of an iron curtains descent across europe 
rededicated part of the fallen berlin wall on friday as a monument 
to peace and freedom 
former president reagan told about 4000 people at an outdoor 
ceremony that the wall sections transplanted to missouri stand as 
proof that the political map of europe has been rewritten 
the future has been redefined even as the veil has been 
lifted on a cruel and bloody past reagan said 
churchills granddaughter artist edwina sandys joined together 
eight sections of the wall to form the 32footlong sculpture she 
carved two passages in the 11foothigh concrete in the shapes of a 
man and a woman so people can pass through freely 
reagan led dignitaries in walking through the openings in the 
wall which is a stark gray on the side that once faced east they 
emerged on the old west side adorned with bright graffiti the 
word unwahr german for untruth appears frequently on the 
wall which has been placed near a bronze statue of churchill 
ms sandys whose sculptures have been displayed in europe and 
at the united nations said she was accustomed to working in 
marble 
thirtytwo feet of concrete created quite a challenge 
unyielding slabs of concrete steeped as they are in heroism and 
history she told the audience 
the sculpture was dedicated on the oneyear anniversary of the 
fall of the wall and more than three years after reagan during a 
berlin visit called on soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to tear 
down this wall 
churchill first invoked the image of an iron curtain to describe 
growing soviet influence during a speech at westminster on march 5 
1946 
from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic an iron 
curtain has descended across the continent he said 
today we come full circle from those anxious times reagan 
said out of one mans speech was born a new western resolve 
some of those attending the ceremony friday had been on hand for 
churchills speech 44 years earlier 
raymond miller of fulton drove the towns mayor in the parade 
for churchill and said it was one of the highlights of his 64 
years 
im real thrilled about being part of history he predicted 
back in 1946 miller said

the new nixon presidential library 
said friday it is delaying two watergate tape exhibits so it can 
display dwight eisenhower paintings and first lady gowns 
the decision was strictly a financial one said library director 
john taylor who denied that the move represents a reluctance to 
feature the scandal that forced richard m nixons 1974 resignation 
as president 
we have a concise and compelling watergate story i feel 
confident it is all right to transfer my attentions elsewhere 
taylor said 
some scholars questioned the librarys postponement of exhibits 
featuring two tape recordings from march 1973 
they dont want to play it the simplest explanation will 
suffice things are no different than since 1972 coverup is the 
order of the day said stanley kutler a university of wisconsin 
professor and author of the recently published the wars of 
watergate the last crisis of richard nixon 
taylor said the librarys section on watergate already includes 
a crucial june 23 1972 tape recording of a conversation between 
nixon and his aides the tape is edited and includes accompanying 
narration 
on the tape nixon agrees to ask the cia to block an 
investigation by the fbi into the breakin at the democratic 
national committee headquarters in the watergate hoteloffice 
complex 
the portions of the june 23 tape on exhibit are the most 
decisive and critical portions taylor said some observers 
might say they are the most clear signs of wrongdoing 
taylor called the charge of a coverup silly and noted that 
the tapes are available to the public elsewhere 
he also said the library the nations only fully privately 
funded presidential library has an obligation to paint a broader 
picture of nixons life and to entertain visitors as well 
we are an attraction one that is involved with describing a 
career that spans and continues to span almost a half of a 
century including nixons terms as vice president under 
president eisenhower taylor said 
a showing of 23 of eisenhowers oil paintings is an integral 
part of the story taylor said he also said improving the 
display of gowns worn by nixons wife pat is justifiable 
gown and textile displays of this nature are very popular at 
the smithsonian the washington museum and at other presidential 
exhibits he said 
he said he ultimately intends to exhibit the two watergate 
tapes at a cost of 15000 to 20000 with the same kind of 
narration and editing used to put the june 23 tape in a historical 
context 
a lot of people saying that it is a coverup are really saying 
that the nixon library should not have the opportunity to place 
nixon documents in a context he feels is accurate taylor said 
on one of the tapes from march 21 1973 white house counsel 
john dean said we have a cancer within close to the presidency 
that is growing on the march 22 tape nixon said he wanted his 
aides to stonewall it plead the fifth amendment cover up 
 
the richard nixon library and birthplace in yorba linda about 
30 miles southeast of los angeles opened in july with festivities 
attended by nixon president bush and others

us roman catholic bishops gave qualified 
support to us actions in the middle east but said the united 
states should maintain nonviolent pressure on iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
the bishops position was submitted to secretary of state james 
baker iii in a letter sent wednesday by los angeles archbishop 
roger mahony chairman of the international policy committee of the 
us catholic conference 
in the letter the archbishop cited socalled just war 
criteria outlined in the us bishops pastoral letter on war and 
peace released in may 1983 
the criteria make war a lastresort action taken only after 
exhausting peaceful means and weighing possible losses against the 
values at stake and the probability of success 
a resort to war in violation of these criteria would 
jeopardize many lives raise serious moral questions and undermine 
the international solidarity against iraq mahony wrote 
my concern is that the pressure to use military force may grow 
as the pursuit of nonviolent options almost inevitably become more 
difficult complex and slow the letter said 
the catholic conference composed of 390 bishops earlier said 
it opposed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and supported united 
nations sanctions 
mahony urged continued cooperation between the united states 
the soviet union arab states and other nations

former west german chancellor willy 
brandt arrived here friday from baghdad with three americans and 
171 other westerners whose freedom he sought in talks with iraqi 
strongman saddam hussein 
one of the americans miles hoffman 33 of columbus ga shot 
in the arm sept 5 by iraqi forces in kuwait was immediately taken 
off the plane and taken to the us air force regional hospital in 
wiesbaden germany for a checkup air force spokesman capt tom 
gilroy said 
a second american don swanke 66 of westlake village calif 
also was taken to the us hospital in wiesbaden 25 miles west of 
frankfurt for a precautionary checkup gilroy said swanke lost 33 
pounds during his captivity 
the airport rang out with the cheers of the hundreds on hand for 
the arrival of the former hostages as the german jetliner touched 
down 
relatives who hadnt seen each other since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 wept and embraced as they emerged from the plane 
some held signs reading thank you mr brandt others departed 
the plane carrying children one woman hugged brandt 
good riddance hoffman told tv cameras at the airplane 
boarding counter in baghdad as he clutched onto his us passport 
and boarding documents his arm was in a cast and he seemed to be 
in pain 
swanke and his wife brenda swanke were presented to reporters 
by us authorities 
the captives including 120 germans had been ordered freed by 
saddam after he met with brandt 
at least two other americans were held back earlier when iraqi 
officials told the us embassy their papers were not in order it 
was unclear if they would be allowed to leave later 
also on the plane were nationals from britain italy 
switzerland finland holland portugal belgium norway and 
luxembourg the german carrier lufthansa said earlier reports of a 
canadian aboard could not be confirmed 
the airlines manifest only listed nationalities not names 
brandt said upon his departure that he had discussed with saddam 
efforts to achieve a durable and solid settlement for the problems 
of the middle east 
at the baghdad airport brandt told a news conference he was 
carrying proposals for settling the 3monthold gulf crisis 
i need a weekend to go through my notes and put together what 
i have brandt said refusing to elaborate 
brandt said he would consult with european leaders next week on 
the outcome of his talks with hussein 
he said he was impressed with saddam adding i have reasons 
to be most grateful to saddam hussein and the government not only 
for their hospitality but also because there is a prospect of 
peace 
foreign minister tarik aziz who accompanied brandt to the 
airport criticized bush administration plans announced thursday to 
send another 200000 troops to the persian gulf 
bush should send diplomats not more troops and he should 
start a dialogue the foreign minister said when reporters asked 
him for a reaction to the us move 
if he wants to scare iraq he already has enough troops the 
decision to send troops will not be helpful it is not going to 
find a solution aziz said 
americans are among foreign hostages held at strategic sites as 
human shields to deter attack by usled multinational forces 
stationed in the gulf 
swanke who was working as a construction engineer at kuwait 
university at the time of the invasion we were worried for a 
hundred days 
i was worried but i was not afraid mrs swanke added she 
held onto her husbands arm as they embarked on germanbound plane 
swanke said that on sept 5 they iraqi troops kicked our 
door down and the couple were taken to the regency hotel in 
kuwait 
from there they were taken to baghdad he said where we 
stayed in a hotel for a week 
he said the couple were then taken to mosul a town about 240 
miles north of baghdad and kept in a house 
after three weeks the couple were moved onto a base i think 
it was a missile assembly and storage area swanke said 
the couple said they had no idea why they were chosen to be 
released and credited brandt with their final departure 
they iraqis wouldnt give us our passports last night they 
wouldnt give them to us today he brandt personally intervened 
and got our name on the list swanke said 
hoffman a financial analyst with the kuwaiti government at the 
time of iraqs aug 2 invasion was shot when iraqi soldiers tried 
to force their way into his kuwait city apartment according to

anatoly karpov said friday he believed his match 
against world champion garry kasparov has produced better chess 
than has been described in the press 
i would not say the quality of the match is at a low level 
karpov told a news conference in this match all games were very 
complicated in all games we witnessed very sharp acute and 
interesting struggle except for the 10th game 
the 10th was one of 10 games that the two soviet players called 
a draw each also has one victory and after a month of play they 
are tied at 6 points each the match now moves to lyons france 
for the final 12 games beginning nov 24 
the first player to score 12 points wins the championship and 
17 million of the 3 million total purse a 1212 tie would 
enable kasparov to retain the crown he lifted from karpov in 1985 
but the money would be split 
kasparov did not appear at the news conference the sponsor said 
he did not know where the champion was or why he decided not to 
attend 
karpov 39 sometimes in english and sometimes through a 
translator told reporters that he thought having the championship 
partly in new york maybe will help revive the interest in chess 
in this country that had been there in 1972 
i remember the time of the chess boom in america in 1972 when 
bobby fischer became world champion he said 
it was a time he recalled when a tournament in san antonio 
offered play at a level high enough to attract a 21yearold 
karpov but fischer feuding with the international chess 
bureaucracy never defended his title and chess interest here 
waned 
several questioners seemed to invite karpov to say that his 
longstanding personal antagonism for kasparov was softening and 
that he could concede that the champions influence has been good 
for him and for chess 
youre trying to persuade me to love kasparov as a mother 
would try to persuade a child to go to sleep karpov said 
i respect him as a chess player very much i have no other 
words to express it as concerns his personality i have spoken 
what i think about his behavior and i dont want to repeat

a recount friday enabled former mayor 
vincent a buddy cianci jr to reclaim the post he was forced 
from in 1984 but his eligibility to hold office was challenged 
because of his felony conviction 
the state board of elections after an afternoon recount of 
voting machines declared cianci the winner by 248 votes over 
fellow republicanturnedindependent frederick lippitt 
as far as comebacks go sure it was a comeback cianci said 
maybe it was astonishing to some people but i always knew we 
could do it 
a legal challenge immediately was filed by three providence 
voters disputing ciancis right to hold office 
the challengers who say they are not affiliated with lippitt 
cite a 1986 amendment to the state constitution that prevents 
anyone convicted of a felony from holding office until three years 
after the conclusion of their sentence and probation 
cianci pleaded no contest on april 24 1984 to assaulting a man 
he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife his wife 
testified cianci went after the man with a fireplace log a lit 
cigarette and an ashtray in rhode island a no contest plea is 
recorded as a conviction 
the felony forced cianci from office his fiveyear suspended 
sentence ended in 1989 
cianci said his campaign had researched the question decided 
the law could not be apply retroactively and called the challenge 
strictly political 
the people have spoken i think the people would rise up if 
anyone tried to steal the election said cianci who became a 
popular radio talk show host after leaving office 
the city board of canvassers planned to certify ciancis victory 
on tuesday executive secretary laurence flynn said it would 
consider the legal challenge later in the week 
cianci had led lippitt by 105 votes going into the recount after 
mail ballots were counted thursday his total then was 16189 
both men had claimed victory tuesday night in the threeway 
race which also included democrat andrew annaldo 
about 100 people watched and recorded the tallies as each of the 
voting machines was opened and read into a public address system 
lippitt 73 later hugged tearful supporters at his campaign 
headquarters and with his voice cracking slightly read a 
statement giving cianci the victory but not his respect 
cianci has great talent if he can put it to good use 
lippitt said not everyone is given a second chance and this time 
i hope he really will be different 
ciancis 10 years in office were some of the most corrupt in 
recent city history with 22 people connected to the administration 
convicted of various crimes cianci never was charged in connection 
with those misdeeds

the hometown of pennsylvania gov robert 
casey is facing a fiscal crisis that could cost half of the 650 
city workers their jobs and the layoffs could start as soon as 
next week the mayor said friday 
the unions representing city firefighters police and the public 
works employees rejected a new healthbenefits package friday night 
that mayor james connors said would save the city 15 million 
in light of the unions decisions connors said he expected to 
begin the layoffs next week 
he said he will consider options other than raising taxes 
adding at some point someone has to represent the citizens 
someone has to represent the taxpayers 
the proposed layoffs could affect about 100 firefighters about 
70 police officers 30 clerical workers and 78 department of public 
works employees 
connors said the city has enough money to meet only its payroll 
this week 
city officials said a court decision refusing to allow the city 
to float a 45 million bond issue triggered the financial crunch 
lackawanna county court denied the bond issue nov 2 the city had 
to win the courts approval because the money would be used for 
payroll expenses 
scranton had counted on the bond for general operating expenses 
when the city council passed the current budget 
eugene carroll president of the local fraternal order of 
police said the union voted 11116 against the healthcare plan 
calling it a giveback and violation of the unions contract 
when asked what advice he would give to city residents who may 
be served by a smaller police force carroll said buy a gun 
lock your doors and keep your children off the street 
the firefighters voted 16915 against the plan paul bernardi 
president of local 669 of the international association of 
firefighters said he hoped the vote sent a message to the city 
that we are not fooling around 
the public works union had voted earlier friday to accept the 
plan only if police and firefighters approved it 
both the police and firefighters unions have minimummanning 
clauses in their contracts calling for complements of 200 in the 
fire department and 140 in the police department 
on thursday the citys clerical workers rejected the health 
benefits package the city offered and connors rejected a 
counterproposal by the clerical union to negotiate a health care 
package 
the unions current contract with the city expires at the end of 
the year 
we want to bargain we dont want it shoved down our 
throats said union representative sal maglio 
we dont have any more concessions that we can make that wont 
cost the taxpayers money said connors 
connors told wneptv that those unions who vote for the new 
benefits package would probably suffer fewer layoffs

a federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of 
taped conversations between manuel noriega and his attorneys but 
cable news network defied the order friday by playing another 
recording 
in the tape noriega discussed two potential government 
witnesses with his defense team and speculated on the prosecutors 
strategy 
cnn president tom johnson defended the broadcast calling the 
judges order unconstitutional prior restraint 
us district judge william hoeveler told cnns attorneys he 
would hold the network in contempt of court if the tapes were 
played but did not act immediately 
in an interview with a cnn producer broadcast later friday 
hoeveler said that whether or not he will find the network in 
contempt remains to be seen 
noriegas attorneys meanwhile accused the us state 
department and the panamanian government of president guillermo 
endara of being the source of the tapes leaked to cnn 
we believe the state department had obtained copies of the 
tapes and gave them to the endara government said noriegas 
lead attorney frank rubino a highplaced person in the endara 
government then provided them to cnn 
a state department spokesman said the agency was aware of 
rubinos comments but had no immediate reaction 
noriega is charged in a february 1988 indictment with accepting 
46 million in bribes to turn panama into a way station for the 
medellin cocaine cartels usbound drug shipments he has been 
held at the metropolitan correctional center outside of miami since 
shortly after he surrendered in the wake of the december 1989 us 
invasion of panama 
the tape played friday by cnn was a conversation between noriega 
and rubinos secretary who acted as a translator for the two men 
she tells him two more people have been arrested in panama and 
says he should review their names to determine whatever they can 
know about you 
the men apparently referred to in the tape were an alfredo 
sanchez and felipe camargo a noriega loyalist now imprisoned in 
panama who had been the generals top liaison with the cubans and 
is believed to be cooperating with the us government 
it is very interesting because it shows their strategy 
noriega says it says they are trying to induce any of the two of 
them to testify before the court against me 
other tapes played friday were conversations between noriega and 
allies including a discussion with his mistress mother about the 
transfer of 4 million cnn said 
earlier friday hoeveler extended for 10 days his order banning 
cnn from using any portion of the tape that could compromise the 
former panamanian dictators attorneyclient privilege 
i cannot conceive that the law of prior restraint is so 
sacrosanct and so encompassing it would allow broadcasting a 
confidential attorneyclient conversation no matter how damaging to 
the defense hoeveler wrote in his order 
the judge has also told cnn to turn over the tapes to a federal 
magistrate but suspended that requirement after the network 
appealed the gag order to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta 
noriega attorney jon may said he was preparing arguments to be 
delivered in atlanta monday balancing the right of free speech 
against the right to a fair trial 
right now we are on the cutting edge of the law in both the 
first amendment and the sixth amendment may said friday this 
could end up very quickly in front of the supreme court 
the us justice department friday was continuing its 
investigation into whether the tapes were made by the bureau of 
prisons and how they got into cnns hands said spokesman doug 
tillett 
the justice department said the bureau of prisons had the legal 
right to tape such calls and does so routinely but may said 
noriegas attorneys were assured their clients calls would not be 
taped 
if he asked the guard to call his lawyers we had been led to 
believe that those calls would not be recorded may said and he 
noted that the prison knew when noriega spoke to the attorneys 
because the guards and not the prisoner dialed the calls 
noriegas attorneys say they expect to ask for dismissal of the 
charges against their client if they can prove misconduct in making 
or handling of the tapes 
the government of panama which in january had said its 
shattered legal system could not properly try noriega says it is 
now in a position to prosecute him if the us case falls apart 
in the case that the north americans cant do it were going 
to ask for him and he will be judged in accord with panamanian 
law because he committed many many crimes endara said 
vice president ricardo arias said noriega has very serious 
charges against him in panama 
the panamanian government has charged noriega and at least seven 
of his officers with looting the treasury

president bush is ordering more than 150000 
additional american troops to the persian gulf a move that nearly 
doubles us firepower in the region and marks a fundamental shift 
toward an offensive military stance 
bush said thursday in announcing the new wave of troop 
deployments for operation desert shield that he still hoped to get 
iraq out of kuwait without starting a war but he said he wanted an 
adequate offensive military option in case united nations 
economic sanctions and diplomatic pressures against iraq prove 
futile 
analysts said the move brought the united states closer to war 
with iraq 
the iraqis in effect are being put on notice that they will 
be attacked unless they withdraw from kuwait under bushs terms

moscow ap the soviet union is giving its qualified approval 
for the use of military force to drive iraqi invaders out of kuwait 
if the economic embargo and other peaceful pressure tactics fail 
but even as secretary of state james a baker iii accomplished 
this goal in talks with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze it became apparent that moscow would be a very 
reluctant partner to such a move in the united nations 
shevardnadze told reporters thursday that the use of force 
probably could not be ruled out but later when he was asked to 
repeat the assertion he laughed and said i wont say

president bush on thursday talked about tough times and 
michael boskin his chief economic adviser spoke of the 
possibility that the economy could contract in either the final 
three months of this year or early 1991 
bush and boskin both avoided using the term recession but 
boskin opened the door to that possibility by discussing the 
chances that the gross national product the countrys total output 
of goods and services might decline in one or more quarters 
the traditional definition of a recession is two consecutive 
quarters of declining gnp

hundreds of people are fleeing 
repressive albania but the welcome is wearing thin in yugoslavia 
a troubled neighbor that already has ethnic problems with a large 
albanian minority 
officials say more than 600 albanians have crossed the heavily 
guarded border from their communist homeland so far this year 
compared to only 40 in 1989 
albanias leaders have begun cautious reforms and seek to emerge 
from decades of selfimposed isolation but many of their people 
are taking a faster route to freedom 
we were forced to escape after enduring years of horror 
said pashko preldakaj who led 20 people through the rugged 
mountains of northern albania last month i cannot describe what 
it is like to live in albania 
preldakajs group evaded albanian frontier guards in an 
allnight trek that covered 20 miles from nikc his home village 
across a mountain range more than 6000 feet high 
adults carried children in their arms scrambling in the dark 
over narrow rocky trails above deep gorges preldakaj said 
yugoslav authorities routinely give escaping albanians up to 30 
days in jail for illegal entry then turn them over to 
representatives of the un high commissioner for refugees 
judith kumin deputy director of the refugee agency said they 
may be kept in yugoslavia temporarily if the united nations pays 
their expenses she said the high commissioners office has no way 
of knowing how many people are caught trying to flee albania 
on average albanian refugees spend six months in yugoslavia 
before emigrating most go to the united states 
the influx has created resentment in serbia yugoslavias 
largest republic where the refugees are kept while awaiting 
resettlement outside the country 
exaggerated claims in serbian media that 300000 albanians have 
moved into the restive southern province of kosovo in the past 50 
years have incited ethnic hostility official statistics indicate 
only 3000 people from albania have moved to yugoslavia since 1945 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent the 19 million people in 
kosovo the heart of medieval serbia where 60 people have been 
killed in ethnic violence during the past year 
only four of the eight refugee centers in yugoslavia still 
accept albanians 
about half of them are housed in the federal detention center at 
padinska skela where conditions are described as overcrowded and 
unsanitary with up to three people sharing a cot 
about 100 albanians were moved out of a refugee center in 
koviljaca southwest of belgrade 
townspeople accused them of molesting local women and after 
allegations in the serbian press that the refugees had poisoned the 
towns water supply held a public protest to demand the albanians 
be removed 
we had to comply quickly before someone got hurt ms kumin 
said 
in the words of the vecernje novosti of belgrade a serbian 
newspaper the townspeople felt they were living under albanian 
occupation so they rose up against it demanding that they the 
albanians be expelled 
recent reports say albanian authorities have softened their 
shoottokill policy on the border and have significantly reduced 
the 25year prison terms previously imposed on citizens caught 
trying to flee 
soldiers on shore opened fire with automatic weapons however 
when aleksandar gruda and 14 other people hijacked a naval patrol 
boat sept 11 and headed for yugoslavia across lake scutari 
dozens of rounds hit the vessel virtually demolishing the 
superstructure grudas 4yearold daughter anisa was killed by a 
bullet that penetrated the hull and struck her in the head 
one of the reasons we left was to provide her with a life 
worthy of a human being gruda said

the korean war ended 37 years ago but a 
sixhour pbs documentary korean the forgotten war has 
touched off a new battle even before the start of the series 
threenight run tonight 
retired army gen rg stilwell a regimental commander during 
the war and 20 years later the commander of united nations forces 
in south korea thinks it is a revisionist account favoring 
north korea and china 
not so says jon halliday a british writer who did the 
documentary for thames television a british commercial network 
that undertook the project as a coproduction with boston public tv 
station wgbh 
i think well catch flak from both the left and the right 
says wgbh executive producer austin hoyt who says he shot new 
interviews and rewrote some portions of the show to create a more 
balanced account 
the shows us version narrated by an american includes 
interviews with north korean officers who fought in the war and 
north korean civilians 
in one exotic case there are comments by joshua chance a man 
of jamaicanchinese ancestry who halliday says was with the massive 
army of chinese volunteers sent into the war when un troops 
pushed up to the yalu river in late 1950 
the show revives old controversies about the war including the 
charges of north korea which invaded the south with troops and 
tanks in june 1950 that south korea started the conflict 
it also reexamines and in the wgbh version generally rebuffs 
the communist sides accusation that the united states waged germ 
warfare in north korea charges sharply denied by the united 
states 
but the show is not solely about the three years of combat in 
which military casualties on both sides came close to 24 million 
including 33629 us combat dead 
it also offers views korean soviet and american of the 
forces that led to the establishment of north and south korea when 
korea was divided at the 38th parallel after world war ii 
it also looks at the rise to power of syngman rhee in the south 
and kim il sung in the north the harsh life under their regimes 
and what the north and south have become in the years following the 
armed truce that ended the war 
the origins of the series hoyt says were really sort of a 
revisionist view by halliday and bruce cumings 
the latter is a chicagobased history professor with whom 
halliday wrote a book on the war he is among those interviewed in 
the series 
i think they made a very good contribution to see the korean 
war in the context of korea hoyt said 
but there were a lot of battles at thames between the official 
british military historians and cumings and halliday over who was 
responsible for the war and whether the united states presence was 
a destructive one 
hoyt asked stilwell to look at the series and offer comments 
and initially he was listed as a consultant on the wghb version he 
later asked that his name and those of two colleagues be deleted 
the request was granted 
the general said he basically objects to the series because he 
considers it tilted toward the north korean and chinese viewpoint 
i think theyve the shows makers shown great cynicism about 
the american effort to come to the aid of a nation under siege and 
stay the course and secure the freedom of that country he said 
the show doesnt favor the communist side halliday said by 
phone from london in fact he said the chinese refused to 
cooperate with us in the making of the series 
his goal was to make it as objective as possible he said 
that is you have to listen to the voices of the competing 
parties but its absolutely not pronorth korean or 
procommunist 
his assessment of hoyts version of the series i think there 
is a tilt towards what i would call sort of the official us 
position 
all is well between hoyt and thames officials according to 
hoyt who says they have backed and are pleased with his changes 
hes philosophical about the war over the documentary 
the fur is flying from both the left and the right frankly 
gen stilwell thinks we didnt do enough to temper the revisionist 
views of halliday and cumings and halliday and cumings think im 
in bed with gen stilwell 
he doesnt anticipate peace for a while 
the way i see it this is sort of like panmunjom he said 
referring to the korean site where peace talks dragged on for two 
years before the war finally ended and where negotiations between 
the former combatants still occur theres not an armistice 
yet 
 
elsewhere in television 
back to the future the prequel cbs which last season got high 
ratings when it aired the pilot of what became i love lucy 
tonight offers a retrospective of the honeymooners another top 
cbs series that began during the korean war hosted by audrey 
meadows who played jackie gleasons longsuffering wife alice 
the onehour show is called the honeymooners anniversary

the 2500 check that he won from the carnegie hero fund commission 
this month it is embarrassing he says to profit when the little 
boy he saved james edwards suffered such pain and disfigurement 
i kind of dont like to take the money because he got burned 
up and all mathews said i really dont need the money right 
away ill probably get him a little something for christmas 
mathews was driving his friend carl knopf to work nov 17 1989 
when he saw smoke coming out of a house a nightgownclad darla 
edwards was on the roof screaming that her son was trapped in a 
rear secondfloor bedroom 
i couldnt believe it knopf said we saw smoke and he 
stopped the car right in the middle of the road ran to the house 
and kicked in the door 
twice he was driven back by smoke and heat on the third try 
mathews put a coat over his mouth took flashlight in hand rushed 
up the stairs and found james unconscious and on fire he was 
burned on 85 percent of his body 
there were flames coming out of the room part of his arm was 
still on fire the coat i had over my mouth to keep the smoke out 
of me i put on his arm to get the fire out said mathews 
he lost the outer part of his ears and all his fingers 
mathews said i just wish i could have come along a little bit 
earlier 
the boy was released from the hospital this summer and is back 
at home after plastic surgery surgeons have fashioned thumbs out 
of his flesh 
the carnegie honor is one of several that have come mathews 
way warren fire chief roger hernon hopes the publicity will get 
him a job 
mathews hasnt worked in more than a year unable to find a job 
in this rust belt city in northeast ohio the area fell on hard 
times during the 1970s and 1980s when the steel industry declined 
mathews lives in a oneroom apartment and uses welfare payments 
to pay his rent and keep his car running he has moved from job to 
job laying carpet hanging dry wall doing maintenance work and 
working as a security guard 
as a child his family was burned out of their home but there 
was no foreshadowing of the heroism he exhibited a year ago 
it was especially a thrill to me the way he did it said 
hernon the fire chief he made an attempt up the stairs ran 
back down and got a coat and ran upstairs and rescued the baby 
the thing that impressed me most was everybody today is 
saying whats in it for me youve heard let george do 
it well he was george it reaffirms your faith in your fellow 
man

david guillen was walking from his apartment 
to an outdoor phone booth one night last december when he saw two 
men shove a 13yearold boy and order him to give up his moped 
guillen a 32yearold truck driver who had grown tired of crime 
in his neighborhood told the men to leave the boy alone 
they did and one man shot guillen to death 
nearly a year after the dec 1 1989 shooting in this los 
angeles suburb the david guillen killing remains unsolved with no 
arrests and apparently no leads but guillens action was not 
forgotten 
the carnegie hero fund commission posthumously awarded guillen 
with one of its medals nov 1 
to guillens friends and family his actions came as no 
surprise 
hed give you the shirt off his back then end up the next day 
without a shirt said brother tony guillen 
among his friends and family he was known as something of a 
character doing things like helping strangers stranded on the 
freeway and talking to just about everybody he met on the street 
guillen had big plans he worried the neighborhood was getting 
too dangerous for his pregnant girlfriend and their son alex he 
wanted to move to the sacramento area and put in a request to 
transfer to his trucking companys northern california office 
he just wanted to get to a smaller safer place said yvonne 
pechenco his girlfriend of five years he was tired of all the 
violence where you couldnt watch the news without all the 
drivebys and shootings 
guillen was so sure the transfer was coming that late last year 
he told yvonne to start packing and he had the utilities shut off 
in their apartment 
as of the first day of december 1989 the phone was 
disconnected with boxes filled and ready to move guillen needed 
to make a quick telephone call to a relative 
the nearest phone was at a market across the street at about 
730 pm guillen left the apartment 
it looked like what we call a street shakedown robbery said 
los angeles county sheriffs detective michael lee these guys 
were hassling a young man guillen says this and that and tried to 
intervene for his trouble he got shot 
his death left scars that have been slow to heal 
miss pechenco who gave birth to guillens son david six 
months after the shooting still cant bring herself to return to 
work and put her life back on course not as long as the case is 
unsolved she said 
i have it in me to go maybe to arizona or something but 
something keeps telling me to stay said miss pechenco raising 
the two boys and living in her mothers east los angeles apartment 
guillen also has two other children both daughters by a 
previous marriage the 2500 carnegie award and the medal went to 
guillens oldest child 13yearold norma by his first marriage 
a year later tears still well in the eyes of his mother pilar 
guillen when she talks about him 
told his son was considered a hero she answered in spanish 
that doesnt bring my son back

ask michael radwich about his 1974 malibu 
and hell regale you with tales of cranking up his pride and joy on 
a local stock car racetrack and how he hopes next year will be his 
big year 
ask about the rescue that won him an award from the carnegie 
hero fund commission and made him a muchadmired local celebrity 
and hes apt to roll his eyes grin an engaging grin and emit a 
series of yeps and nopes 
its all right i guess he says 
a year ago radwich grabbed coworker scott pierce and fought a 
desperate tugofwar with a gravel grinder hungry to snatch both 
men into its rusty maw 
today he doesnt know what made him risk his life for a man who 
was no more than a casual acquaintance nothing in his previous 23 
years had raised the issue of what he would do if it came to a 
decision between standing aside or chancing death 
i never really thought about it to tell you the truth he 
said in a recent interview from his modest apartment tucked behind 
the hardware store in this western massachusetts town of 1700 
i figured i had to do something i couldnt leave him 
radwich still works at the gravel plant and he still carries 
the marks of his actions a bent and scarred left thumb he can 
wiggle only about a halfinch lefthanded he had to teach himself 
to write again and it will be a few more months before he can go 
back to his passion stockcar racing 
my doctor says one crazy thing to another he said with a 
laugh 
the man he rescued has a little more to say 
im just glad someone was there that was quick thinking if he 
wasnt there i would have been killed my arm would have been torn 
off by the shaft and i would definitely have been killed pierce 
said 
there arent enough words thanks seems to be all right with 
him 
the accident occurred oct 18 1989 while the 21yearold 
pierce and radwich were trying to repair the grinder a large 
structure towering 80 feet above the ground that on a good day 
clanks and throbs as it spits out gravel and sand 
he moved in to look at something he had a shirt on that was 
unbuttoned and the tails came out and got wrapped up in the shaft 
and he reached in to try to pull it out and thats when he got 
caught up in it radwich recalled 
he started yelling to shut it off and the switch to shut it 
off was down on the ground so i grabbed a hold of him he said 
after a third man hit an emergency switch on the ground the two 
men fell back on the platform pierce with his left arm hanging on 
by the triceps radwich with his left thumb all but severed 
both men have regained use of their injured limbs through 
operations and therapy but neither is back 100 percent 
the two men said theyve become closer since 
he doesnt expect anything from me pierce said when we 
see each other we talk and stuff but he never says well since i 
did this you go down to the store and get me something he treats 
me just like everybody else

roy aden didnt hesitate when he saw a man 
grab a gun away from a state trooper 
if you dont help someone in need then youre a failure he 
says and one failure can destroy your whole life 
aden 48 a former marine who still sports a crew cut jumped in 
when state trooper christopher phillips was on the verge of losing 
a lifeanddeath struggle with a man in front of the skyland nc 
service station where aden worked 
i feel good about being recognized but i didnt do it for 
that he said id like to think another person would do the 
same thing 
after working the latenight shift at the exxon station last 
feb 11 aden saw phillips pull over a car in front of the gas 
pumps as the trooper approached the car the driver got out and 
pulled out a large hunting knife 
after phillips took the weapon away the man bolted phillips 
caught up with him and they struggled as he tried to cuff him 
the man grabbed phillips service revolver from its holster 
thats when aden rushed to the troopers aid 
he was on top of the trooper and i came up from behind and 
pulled him off thats when i saw the gun point up in the air 
aden said the man screamed get away ive got a gun i held 
his arm and the gun went off 
we were struggling and we went down this guy was pretty 
strong it took both of my hands to hold his one hand then trooper 
phillips regained his balance and the two of us grabbed hold of the 
gun 
i didnt even think about what had happened until it was 
over he said he could have killed both of us 
when word of his deed hit the local media aden was recognized 
as a hero he received awards from the highway patrol several 
local civic organizations and gov jim martin 
to tell you the truth if i didnt help i wouldnt have been 
able to look at myself in the mirror the next morning he said 
my mother and father raised me to know the difference between 
right and wrong 
aden admits hes far from infallible hes been married three 
times the last 10 years to his wife pat who urged her husband to 
intervene when she saw the trooper in trouble 
with her help aden has kicked a drinking problem the day 
before he received the carnegie award and a 2500 cash prize he 
lived up to his promise to her and went to church for the first 
time in years he used part of the money to help his sister pay 
some overdue bills 
aden said he found it difficult to accept the carnegie award 
after he learned that three of the winners died in their attempts 
to save others 
it reminded him of how he felt after receiving the silver star 
and other medals upon returning from duty in vietnam where many of 
his friends were killed or seriously injured 
the ones who died those are the real heroes he said i 
may have risked my life but they gave it

larry ogletree doesnt think of himself as a hero 
the evans ga man said he was just doing what he hopes anyone 
would do when he chased a runaway car dodged traffic and stopped 
an oncoming 18wheeler to rescue a 2yearold boy inside the car 
if one of my sons were in a lifethreatening situation 
whether it be that or anything i would want somebody to do the 
same thing said ogletree general manager for the american 
national insurance cos office in augusta and the father of three 
boys ages 12 7 and 4 
ogletree 40 had just turned onto a busy fivelane highway in 
suburban martinez on his way to work aug 8 1989 when he spotted 
the silver compact car rolling out of a convenience store parking 
lot 
it just didnt look normal he said there was something 
wrong the wheels werent turning or anything then i saw the 
childs head in the back of the car 
he also saw a woman later identified as the childs mother 
standing in the parking lot screaming 
at that point i knew what was happening ogletree said 
he jumped the median in his own car and parked then began 
chasing the runaway car which was traveling diagonally across 
traffic headed into the path of the oncoming tractortrailer rig 
i looked up at the 18wheeler ogletree said his and my 
eyes met he just understood and he of course applied his brakes 
he was about 10 feet from the car i was running the whole time 
ogletree finally got close enough to grab the drivers side of 
the car which was open i threw myself into it i had a hold of 
the steering wheel and applied the brakes the child was calm until 
i hit the brakes then he started crying he was in a safety 
seat 
ogletree who escaped with only scarred shins said he believes 
the boys sister accidentally hit the gearshift when she got out of 
the car allowing the car to roll 
the mother thanked him but implored him not to release her name 
or the names of her children a request he has honored 
ogletree said he didnt fully grasp what might have happened 
until that night when he went to pick up his two younger boys at a 
daycare center adjacent to the convenience store 
i guess that at that point it kind of came over me i might not 
have been there to pick them up it was very emotional he said 
frank spears an insurance agent in a competing firm has known 
ogletree more than 10 years and said he wasnt surprised by his 
actions 
hes that kind of a fellow spears said he is not one 
that sits on the sidelines he is a doer a mover a shaker if you 
go into a fight you want him to be behind you 
i dont think any of us were prepared for the fact that 
someone would have the courage to do what he did said carol 
shearer a volunteer at the columbia county humane society who met 
ogletree now the groups president about two years ago hes 
been very modest about it

the smallbusiness optimism index fell in 
october to its lowest level in more than 10 years presaging a 
shrinking of the economy in the final quarter of the year 
economist william c dunkelberg who analyzed replies from more 
than 2000 small and mediumsize businesses said gross national 
product would decline by 15 percent the first official quarter 
with negative growth 
dunkelberg said the responses suggested the decline would be 
accompanied by higher unemployment and worsening inflation and he 
blamed the latter partly on what he said was congress failure to 
solve the deficit problem 
adding to inflationary pressures he said was the prospect that 
congress is prepared to heap on a whole new set of costraising 
regulations including various mandated costs and paperwork that 
will consume time and effort 
the index is based on responses from members of the national 
federation of independent business which claims more than 500000 
members ranging from proprietorships to companies with sales in 
the hundreds of millions of dollars 
the federation says the business community it represents employs 
about half the private nonfarm work force and produces about 50 
percent of gross national product and that its optimism index 
foretells economic direction 
its estimate of thirdquarter gross national product for 
example was for a gain of 17 percent on an annual basis just 
onetenth of one percent from the commerce departments preliminary 
estimate of a 18 percent gain 
dunkelberg dean of temple universitys school of business and 
management was especially critical of what he said was 
legislationinduced inflation resulting from imposition of 
regulations and mandates on an already stressed private sector 
among regulations he said would add to business costs were a 
rise in the minimum wage and mandated health costs mandated 
leaves mandated access for the handicapped mandated pollution 
controls and lots of related paperwork that will eat up valuable 
entrepreneurial time 
in effect he said mandates are a form of taxation atop 
official taxation which the responding companies declared the no 
1 problem facing small business today 
the federal reserve he said cannot reduce this kind of 
inflation through monetary policy adding that only congress can 
do it with some responsible legislation and some common sense 
while many people expect the fed to ease up on the money supply 
and allow interest rates to fall dunkelberg discounted the 
possibility inflation fears he said will simply prevent any 
major easing 
a large factor in the decline of the confidence index was what 
dunkelberg said was the incredible finding that 43 percent of 
the companies expect business conditions to worsen almost double 
the previous quarters level 
expected business conditions is one of 10 items making up the 
index among others are expected sales volumes expected credit 
conditions current job openings plans to hire and capital outlay 
plans 
the index was begun in 1974 and uses 1978 conditions as its base 
of 100 the latest reading of 923 was the lowest since the second 
quarter of 1980 when the alltime low of 811 was reached 
aside from the alltime low the latest reading was the lowest 
for any quarter since the first year of the indexs existence when 
it reached 878 in early 1975 
summing up he results dunkelberg said its clear the economy 
is going down at least for a short count the expansion wasnt 
marked by extremes he said and it is likely the slowdown that 
follows will be equally boring

if you look for a spark of life in the stock 
market these days the search pretty much begins and ends with 
electric utility issues 
while the dow jones average of 30 industrials was climbing to 
record highs near the 3000 mark earlier this year the electric 
utility group languished in disfavor 
but since late summer as fears of recession gripped the 
markets the roles have been reversed from its low point for the 
year on aug 24 through nov 2 dow joness average of 15 utilities 
climbed more than 13 percent 
among the 15 common stocks listed on the new york stock exchange 
that made new 52week highs in the week ended nov 2 nine were 
shares of electric companies from dqe inc in pittsburgh to 
houston industries in texas from dominion resources on the east 
coast to pacific gas amp electric in california 
as often happens in periods of market euphoria investors 
shunned the group in the spring and early summer while they looked 
for racier ways to benefit from rising stock prices 
now analysts say money is flowing back the other way looking 
for a highyielding haven from the perils of a bear market 
investing in the electric utilities in a climate of economic 
weakness presents something close to a winwin situation 
maintains barry abramson an analyst at prudentialbache 
securities in a recent report spotlighting the group 
electric utilities would be strong in a sideways market if 
the economy continues to stagnate and the stock and bond markets 
show no clear direction the electric utilities should outperform 
thanks to their superior and very safe yields 
on the other hand if a recession continues to threaten and 
the federal reserve eases dramatically falling interest rates 
would also provide a catalyst for the group 
in fact just about the only scenario that would be negative 
for the electric utilities would be a rapidly strengthening economy 
and a renewed bull market a very unlikely outcome at least in 
the near term 
the current level of utility dividends the stocks yielded 
about 67 percent on average as of early this month is an 
attraction by itself 
beyond that analysts say utility profits and payouts arent 
much affected by the ups and downs of the business cycle and can 
even keep growing gradually in periods of recession 
they offer high dividends that our analysts believe are 
secure said jack lavery director of global research at marrill 
lynch 
utilities also stand to be prime beneficiaries of declining 
interest rates since lower rates reduce the relative allure of 
bonds as the two classes of securities compete for the favor of 
yieldconscious investors 
but that last point has a flip side caution some wary 
utilitywatchers when hopesfor lower rates go unfulfilled 
utility stocks often bear the brunt of their frustration 
the group fell sharply last january for example when a rise in 
worldwide interest rates caught many optimists off guard 
whether the news is good or bad however many observers say 
utilities ultrasensitivity to changing interestrate expectations 
often qualifies them as an advance indicator of where the rest of 
the stock market might be heading 
said william lefevre at advest inc frequently the utilities 
turn early both before the broad stock market starts down and 
before it turns up

just a minute karlyn kohrs campbell 
hold on there kathleen hall jamieson 
what do you think youre doing 
you set out to write a serious scholarly maybe 
justalittledull book about the crucial role that language plays 
in the making of a successful presidency 
you say you want to demonstrate rhetoric to be a fundamental 
constitutive element of the presidency 
that youve done 
the university of chicago press published it 
the title is deeds done in words presidential rhetoric and 
the genres of governance 
it is full of arcane language and heavy thoughts 
the special character of presidential inaugural addresses is 
defined by these general epideictic features and by the nature of 
the inauguration ceremony you write 
stuff like that 
you didnt set out to write one would think a feminist tract 
but that youve done too 
youve dedicated your book to the women who should have been 
president to the women who tried to be president to the women who 
will be president 
in footnote 12 to chapter 4 you drop your bombshell youve 
read every state of the union address ever delivered and 
discovered that in these speeches women are invisible 
through 1966 you write they are mentioned only twice 
once in relation to polygamy by ulysses grant once in relation 
to suffrage by woodrow wilson more recently they have been 
alluded to indirectly in ronald reagans statements supporting 
abortion 
and to drive home your point about the maleness of presidential 
vision you turn to a linguistic device you use sic to show 
that the words quoted are reproduced exactly as they appeared in 
the original 
you use sic to show that in their most formal rhetoric 
presidents have always talked about and thought about he when 
they might have said and thought about he or she 
in this book sic is a scythe 
look 
quoting the constitution the president shall from time to 
time give to the congress information on the state of the union and 
recommend to their consideration such measures as he sic shall 
judge necessary and expedient 
quoting george washington the magnitude and difficulty of 
the trust to which the voice of my country called me being 
sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her 
citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his sic qualifications 
could not but overwhelm with despondence one who ought to be 
peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies 
quoting theodore roosevelt our aim is to recognize what 
lincoln pointed out the fact that there are some respects in which 
men sic are obviously not equal 
quoting harry truman in all that we do we should remember 
who we are and what we stand for we are americans our forefathers 
sic had far greater obstacles than we have and much poorer 
chances of success 
quoting lyndon johnson for our ultimate goal is a world 
without war a world made safe for diversity in which all men 
sic goods and ideas can freely move across every border and 
every boundary 
whats up 
in an interview author jamieson dean of the annenberg school 
of communication at the university of pennsylvania ducks 
thats my coauthor says ms jamieson we let the senior 
author do the stylistic stuff if it had been up to me id have 
settled for a statement in the introduction you can make the point 
once your readers are smart enough 
so senior author campbell professor of speechcommunication at 
the university of minnesota what are all these sics here for 
as kind of a reminder to the audience about the very real male 
character of political thinking in this country in the past i 
dont think of it as a feminist book but i think of it as a book 
that has some feminist sensibility 
so take note mister sic presidents

in what they did and what they didnt do 
after their bitter us senate race jesse helms and harvey gantt 
symbolized the rift in a state deeply divided over its most 
conspicuous member of congress 
helms gleefully tweaked his antagonists the ultraliberal 
establishm promising to press on with his agenda a 
combination of traditional antibig government conservatism and 
antiabortion antihomosexual and other appeals 
cant you just hear the sobs he asked with a broad smile 
after winning his fourth term 
gantt acknowledged only that helms received more votes refusing 
to phone the states senior senator or officially concede i 
dont concede to that kind of campaign or that kind of vision for 
north carolina he said 
theres no way to extend a hand said professor john 
aldrich chairman of duke universitys political science 
department he and other analysts and voters themselves said 
helms strongly held views and iconoclastic style leave few 
constituents lukewarm about him 
some north carolinians voted for helms as a folk hero others 
voted against him as an embarrassment 
many of helms supporters feel proud and some say relieved 
that the ultraconservative republican pulled out a victory they 
still smart however at labels they say were pinned on them during 
the campaign illiterate uneducated racist 
gantts faithful boast of the strong showing 474 percent of 
the vote by the black challenger who had been given little 
chance when he entered the contest theyre determined to try 
try again for now though many say they feel unrepresented 
two north carolinians whose votes canceled each other out 
illustrate the strong feelings helms elicits 
joe overby voted for helms he likes the senators conservative 
fiscal and social views overby said hes concerned about the 
growing national debt troubled by the influence of liberal 
politicians and commentators just as much he likes helms refusal 
to compromise even when under harsh attack 
hes the only man thats ever run for office who said hed do 
so and so and hes done it he wont back down said overby 80 
who arrived at a helms postelection rally wearing the 
starsandstripes top hat and jacket of uncle sam 
a printed card he gave a reporter contains his picture and 
examples of his philosophy which he said reflects his idea of the 
traditional north carolina values that helms said he 
represented 
lets all read our bible the card says in part let us 
thank god that we live in the greatest nation in all the world 
helms won 58 percent of the votes of older north carolinians 
and 67 percent of the white protestant vote along with support 
from traditional republicans and others according to exit polls 
he won about 65 percent of the white vote overall and did better 
in rural areas 
younger more urban people tended to vote for gantt and he 
garnered 93 percent of the black vote according to the polls 
clarence mcadoo 36 a black custodian at a public school in 
greensboro fits that profile and he said he saw north carolinas 
divisions deepening with helms campaign and victory 
he cited a television ad helms used late in the campaign when 
polls indicated the race was close it showed the hands of a white 
job seeker crumpling an application after being told that racial 
quotas required the position go to someone else even though that 
person was less qualified 
the old bogeyman tactics said mcadoo 
gantt said a day after the election that he may have 
underestimated race as a factor among voters we have to deal 
with the question of race as a state he said 
taking a lunch break from his custodial duties mcadoo said the 
racial message he picked up from helms hurt and he told a story 
about his children 
my youngest two came over last night to help me clean up after 
the election the school had been a polling place and we talked 
about it as we were riding home there was a mock election at 
school that day and it showed mr gantt was going to win so they 
were disappointed too 
i told them not to look at the race as a blackandwhite 
issue i dont want them to get that type of mentality mcadoo 
said its more or less that when at first you dont succeed 
try try again im just trying to teach them the oldfashioned 
values like i was taught 
state republican party officials denied race decided the 
election and local organizers contended the charge was just part 
of an unfair view of the voters they knew 
i keep reading about the stereotype that it was a racist 
thing said patrick farmer gop chairman in onslow county which 
voted 61 percent39 percent for helms while also electing a black 
democratic judge by a landslide the racism charge just wouldnt 
be borne out 
farmer said he resented the way helms voters often were 
portrayed especially as the television networks focused on the 
north carolina race one of the newscasters said well 
obviously the helms supporters are the illiterate tobaccochewing 
uneducated people 
but farmer described them as a crosssection of everyone 
business people like himself retirees farmers factory workers 
they breathed a sigh of relief when the election was over 
because of the sharp political differences between their candidate 
and his opponent 
were glad to have someone in washington who does say no he 
said 
gantt made no effort to conceal his liberal credentials 
government has a role he said in solving education enviromental

breed of southern politician

campaigning before white audiences helms accused gantt of 
running a secret campaign to get black voters to the polls 
some voters remembered helms 12year tenure in the 1960s and early 
70s as an onair commentator for a raleigh television station 
during which he called civil rights leaders communists and blasted 
war protesters and the press 
he operates by playing on the fears of people about secular 
devils said political science professor abraham holzman of north 
carolina state university degenerate devils homosexual devils 
abortionist devils liberal devils 
some gantt supporters described helms in terms of evil too and 
such bitterness cant be put aside at the end of the campaign 
holtzman said asking how can you shake hands with the devil 
aldrich the duke professor said changing demographics may 
eliminate the gulf helms won votes from people born in the south 
but more and more north carolinians are emigres from other states 
he said he also noted the younger vote against the 69yearold 
senator and the declining populations in many rural areas a helms 
stronghold 
eventually helms no longer will have the kind of majority he 
assembled aldrich said 
then he said the acrimony level will drop off 
tremendously

those looking for economic signals in tuesdays 
election noted lots of frustration with the status quo 
the economy was a top concern among voters according to surveys 
conducted outside polling places but the resolve to bear any 
burden to rebuild the economy was much less evident 
the results defied a simple label antibush antitax 
antiincumbent antispending there was evidence of all that 
leaving the surviving office holders to wonder what their next 
moves ought to be 
raise taxes forget it 
the voters turned out governors in florida and kansas associated 
with tax hikes and sen bill bradley dnj was nearly defeated 
because of state tax increases initiated by democratic gov jim 
florio who wasnt even on the ballot 
cut the deficit ok but watch where you cut 
candidates endorsed by president bush were blistered by the 
voters partly because of his awkward handling of the federal 
budget compromise incumbents in congress who were also a party to 
the preelection deficit deal mostly were returned to office but 
margins were shockingly slim in many cases 
raise money for public projects through bond issues not so 
fast 
propositions for prison construction colleges parks 
environmental initiatives and housing loans went down to defeat 
voters seemed disenchanted with government in general indeed 
one lucky survivor republican william weld won the governors 
office in massachusetts by promising to pare government and keep 
the priority list short 
even more troubling were the large numbers of voters who chose 
to bypass the election many because they had lost faith in the 
problemsolving ability of any politicians 
yet the results did not suggest an allout tax revolt in 
massachusetts for instance the voters rejected a ballot 
initiative that would have rolled back state taxes by about 2 
billion a year 
the voters called instead for new ideas they elected democrat 
lawton chiles governor of florida because he promised to spurn 
special interests and listen to the people chiless grassroots 
campaign included talking with people at recycling centers 
teenage pregnancy programs and daycare centers 
the economic mandate was best articulated by house majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo himself a reelection survivor who 
said the president had to come to capitol hill with an action 
plan for reviving the economy and reworking the system to the 
benefit of working families 
the goal to rework the system was clear but the plan for 
achieving it wasnt leaders from the statehouse to the white house 
faced the challenge of designing fresh approaches from a limited 
array of options

the markets for their part went right on hoping for an easy 
way out of the economic downturn namely looser credit from the 
federal reserve 
the quickest fix for the economy would be a biggerthannormal 
shot of inflation that would make debts carried by all entities 
government businesses and households a lot easier to shoulder 
the fed gave a preelection sign that credit would ease when it 
lowered the rate charged on overnight loans between banks in 
response to thebudget compromise the markets were hoping for 
still more 
the forecast for lower rates prompted heavy demand for 34 
billion in new government securities offered for sale in a 
quarterly refunding by the treasury investors gobbled up the new 
bonds and notes to lock in current interest rates 
meanwhile traders worried about the prospects for war now that 
national officials have the election behind them 
stocks and bonds tumbled and oil rallied the day after election 
mostly in response to new signals that war could be imminent in the 
persian gulf among those reviving such talk was the normally 
reliable british prime minister margaret thatcher 
two oil market analysts even tried to narrow the window for war 
by analyzing the tides and the moon 
peter beutel and thomas blakeslee of pegasus econometric group 
inc said the best time for attack would be after midnight between 
nov 12 and nov 22 the kuwaiti tide would be high after midnight 
allowing commandos to get closer to a potential beachhead the moon 
phase would keep the sky dark

the nations top retailers reported dismal sales for october 
heightening concerns about the christmas season 
several companies including sears roebuck and jc penney co 
said sales were down from october of last year 
the retail business has been slow since august due to 
uncertainty over the economy and the persian gulf and most experts 
said the slump would continue through the holidays 
one analyst jeffrey feiner of merrill lynch amp co said 
shoppers had settled into a recessionary psychology 
the impact on holiday sales could be devastating for 
storekeepers and mean smaller cheaper gifts under the tree

the american consumer gives little promise of 
providing much help as the economy and wall street struggle into 
the last few weeks of a difficult year 
surveys that seek to measure sentiment among the shopping public 
show a pronounced mood of caution heading into the traditional peak 
season for business at the nations retail stores 
even if consumers were inclined to come riding to the rescue 
analysts say all the economic evidence shows them low on 
ammunition in the form of money to spend 
personal income growth is slowing markedly observed david 
resler chief economist at nomura securities international in new 
york 
this decline reflects the triple threat of declining total 
employment higher taxes and surging energy costs none of these 
holds much hope for quick relief 
nor do the other main factors that influence consumer spending 
look encouraging the sharp decline in stock prices since midjuly 
and the ongoing slide in housing values has slashed household 
wealth 
market interest rates may be edging down but theres no 
evidence that this is lowering consumer borrowing costs 
october sales reports issued by major retailers this past week 
provided a gloomy picture on balance of the state of demand at 
the threshold of the holiday selling season 
figures due this wednesday from the commerce department on 
retail sales for october are likely to show a drop about 02 
percent according to the merrill lynch market letter 
adjusted for inflation sales have been essentially flat since 
june merrill lynch analysts say we think sales will weaken 
through the fourth quarter and into early 1991 
a primary damper on consumers optimism by common agreement 
has been the near doubling of oil prices that has accompanied the 
showdown in the persian gulf over iraqs invasion of kuwait 
at their recent levels energy costs act in the manner of a tax 
increase draining disposable income from consumers wallets and 
checkbooks 
beyond that analysts say enthusiasm has been chilled by 
heightened uncertainty over what gasoline heating fuel and 
petroleumbased products will cost in the future 
three months into the crisis economists investors and 
consumers are still able only to guess among a broad range of 
possible outcomes in the middle east 
that kind of uncertainty made itself evident in the stock market 
this past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed 
friday at 248861 down 223 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 110 to 17117 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
550 to 34195 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 105 at 29103 
volume on the big board averaged 14770 million shares a day 
against 15429 million the week before 
the federal reserve is widely expected to step up efforts soon 
to stimulate the economy through an easing of credit policy but 
many analysts caution that even measures of that kind arent likely 
to work wonders overnight 
monetary policy should ease but it will take until at least 
mid1991 for this policy to help the economy said robert j 
stalla at the clevelandbased firm of mcdonald amp co in a recent 
commentary easy money affects the real economy only after a 
ninemonth lag 
in addition stalla declared the root of the economic problem 
lies mainly inthe financial rather than the real sector this 
means that lower interest rates might be used to shore up the 
capital structures of financial intermediaries rather than as an 
excuse for liberalizing lending policies

hopes for a successful christmas shopping season all but 
vanished after the nations biggest retailers said their business 
continued to deteriorate in october 
several companies including sears roebuck amp co and jc penney 
co inc reported thursday that their sales dropped from levels of 
a year earlier as consumers preoccupied with concerns about the 
economy and the middle east avoided buying anything they didnt 
need 
the disappointing october sales followed poor showings in august 
and september and with christmas less than seven weeks away 
retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance 
expect consumers to remain frugal during the holiday season 
theyll probaby be going in and buying the same number of 
items but theyre not going to pay as much said thomas 
tashjian an analyst with seidler amdec securities inc in los 
angeles theyre not going to buy 100 electronic toys for their 
kids not this year 
analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and 
waiting longer for price reductions than in past years 
theyre going to be busy spending fewer dollars said daniel 
barry an analyst with kidder peabody amp co 
consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait raised the specter of war inflating 
prices of gasoline and home heating oil 
the first items crossed off shopping lists were socalled 
discretionary items clothing furniture home appliances and 
other extras that are the bread and butter of many big stores 
if retailers have a difficult christmas it could contribute to 
a further deterioration of the economy since twothirds of the 
nations economic growth is generated by consumer spending 
unsold goods on store shelves could also affect manufacturing 
if stores dont place new orders factories dont need to provide 
as many products and could lay off workers 
and a poor christmas season could be devastating for the 
retailers themselves as they depend on holiday shopping for about 
half their annual sales and profits christmas 1989 was a 
disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash 
prices to attract customers 
sears the countrys largest retailer said october results from 
stores open at least one year fell 04 percent from a year earlier 
while overall sales dropped 12 percent 
analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year also 
known as samestore or comparable store sales provide a more 
accurate assessment of a retailers performance than overall sales 
do new stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can 
skew a retailers results 
one of the hardest hit last month was penney which said 
comparable store sales fell 63 percent from october 1989 while 
overall sales dropped 49 percent 
limited inc the nations largest specialty apparel retailer 
reported comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall sales 
rose 13 percent apparel stores were also affected by continuing 
warm weather in some parts of the country 
may department stores co parent of big department store chains 
including lord amp taylor hechts filenes and foleys said 
comparable store sales dropped 44 percent while overall sales 
edged up 11 percent 
but walmart stores inc one of the biggest discount retailers 
continued to outperform the rest of the retail industry reporting 
comparable store sales rose 10 percent while overall sales rose 25 
percent 
analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores 
especially those going into the christmas season with high 
inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales these retailers are 
expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise and see 
their profits evaporate 
markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers having seen 
one round of price reductions wait for more merchandise to be 
marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts when 
one retailer lowers prices it pressures others to follow 
among other reports from retailers thursday 
dayton hudson corp said comparable store sales rose 41 
percent while overall sales picked up 167 percent 
kmart corp reported a 13 percent sales gain at comparable 
stores and an 112 percent rise overall 
woolworth corp said comparable store sales increased 1 
percent while overall sales rose 42 percent 
the results announced thursday differ from the monthly retail 
sales report from the government the commerce departments figures 
includes sales from supermarkets restaurants and car dealers

as competition heats up to make the 
speediest computers to solve the biggest problems in science intel 
corp is poised to introduce what the company says is the worlds 
fastest supercomputer 
supercomputer fever spurred on by pentagon funding in many 
cases is getting hotter as researchers look for ways to apply the 
machines that can speed up medical research and help create 
smart bombs among other uses 
if we can make microprocessors smaller and faster they would 
be very useful for advanced weapons systems pentagon spokeswoman 
jan bodanyi said thursday they will be the ultimate weapons 
system once we get supercomputers down to soupcan size we can 
put them on missiles 
industry analysts warn however that despite the push to create 
supercomputers that can handle more information at one time and at 
mindboggling speeds the real challenges are to harness that 
power to maintain top speeds and to make the systems even smaller 
and cheaper 
there arent many people out there who can afford to pay 25 
million to 30 million for a top of the line supercomputer said 
christopher willard senior industry analyst at san josebased 
dataquest another problem is actually getting and using the full 
power of the highly parallel computers its hard to deliver and 
sustain the full power 
officials at santa clarabased intel have refused to release 
information on the companys new supercomputer before a formal 
announcement at an industry conference in new york on tuesday the 
california institute of technology at pasadena where the 
supercomputer will be installed also has refused to comment 
intel which invented the microprocessor is an industry leader 
in chip design and manufacture its new supercomputer will use 512 
of the companys powerful i860 chips now intels most powerful 
machine uses 128 of those chips 
a parallel system links separate microprocessors to create the 
supercomputer which in intels case would reportedly reach speeds 
of up to 32 gigaflops or 32 billion floatingpoint operations per 
second the customary measure of a computers ability to crunch 
numbers and information 
skeptics including intels competitors ncube of beaverton 
ore and cray research inc of minneapolis wonder if the new 
machine can actually reach that computation speed even for simple 
problems 
no supercomputer can maintain that type of speed said 
charles grasfl marketing analyst for cray which dominates the 
supercomputer market i want to know what it can do wheres the 
breakthrough 
one analyst compared supercomputers to using 10000 rabbits to 
plow a field instead of four horses the rabbits may have more 
total energy but controlling that power is difficult still 
scientists continue to try 
whats fascinating about supercomputers is what people will be 
able to achieve one day said abbie kendall spokeswoman for 
ncube right now were on the edge of technology 
in mid1989 ncube introduced its supercomputer which at 27 
gigaflop was the worlds fastest the company is working on a 
quicker model 
the intel supercomputer will reportedly be used for research 
including study of how to better apply such huge computer brains 
supercomputers still have a long way to go in terms of use for 
the average programmer said dataquests willard the 
application i think will come from not what the systems top 
configuration can do but with what its smaller chunks can 
accomplish 
now the marketplace is limited to universities military 
nasa what they need to do is some supercomputing for more 
mundane uses 
ncube hasnt sold its topoftheline 20 million supercomputer 
yet but kendall said the private company expects to sell one by 
mid1991 
now she said ncube sells smaller parallel systems that can do 
more work faster than regular computers a drug company for 
example gets results in three to four hours about molecule 
configurations for new manufactured drugs instead of the three 
months such a computation took previously

wholesale prices were still climbing three 
months after iraqs takeover of kuwait jolted world oil markets but 
absent a shooting war they should begin to moderate soon many 
analysts believe 
the aug 2 invasion wrecked many economists prediction that 
inflation would ease this year oil prices doubled from an average 
of around 20 a barrel in july 
overwhelmed by the shock the labor departments producer price 
index which measures the prices paid by manufacturers farmers and 
other producers took off 
it shot up 13 percent in august and 16 percent in september 
for the biggest twomonth increase in a decade 
in advance of todays report on the index for october most 
economists were expecting a rise of about 07 percent although 
much milder thats still worrisomely high if continued for 12 
consecutive months it would produce annual wholesale inflation of 
87 percent 
but better times are ahead unless war disrupts oil supplies 
further analysts said crude oil prices although jumpy have 
settled back to around 35 a barrel from highs of 40 
the worst of the oil shock is going to be past after this 
months data of course there could be a war at any moment and that 
would change the outlook said economist bruce steinberg of 
merrill lynch inc 
wholesale prices overall increased at a 63 percent annual rate 
during the first nine months of 1990 sharply higher than the 48 
percent gain for all of last year 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university predicted 
a 1990 increase in the producer price index of only 31 percent 
ratajczak and steinberg both foresaw some ripple effects from 
higher oil prices into related items particularly those with heavy 
transportation costs but they said the economic slowdown which 
many analysts say has just about deepened into a recession will 
subdue those effects 
in general the inflation outlook is improving steinberg 
said the reason is simple if you have a recession inflation 
goes down it always works since i believe were having a 
recession i believe inflation will come down 
steinberg said demand is just too weak and sales too slow for 
businesses to pass on most of their increased energy costs 
michael boskin chief economic adviser to president bush argued 
that the runup in petroleum prices will be less destructive now 
than during previous oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 
no 1 thus far the price increase has been substantially less 
than the increases of the 1970s and in proportionate terms 
we use onethird less energy than we used to boskin told the 
american council for capital formation 
once the middle eastern situation resolves itself obviously 
oil prices are going to come down he said 
economist samuel kahan of fuji securities inc said the break in 
inflation should provide the federal reserve with an opportunity to 
stimulate the economy with lower interest rates 
he predicted a quarterpoint cut in the federal funds rate the 
rate banks charge each other for overnight loans to 7 percent by 
early december 
the economy looks like its weakening and i think they want to 
provide the cushion to prevent it from becoming a sliding 
collapse kahan said

the health insurance industry will be an 
irresistible target as congress sets out anew next year to try 
to rein in the costs of medical care a key senator says 
sen jay rockefeller dwva said the attractiveness of 
further regulating private insurers is that doing so would not cost 
the federal government any money 
you talk about an irresistible target a nice plump turkey 
sitting on the table at thanksgiving time thats it 
rockefeller chairman of the senate finance subcommittee on 
medicare and long term care said thursday 
and as evidence that congress has the will to make such changes 
he noted that lawmakers included in the deficitreduction package 
passed last month new limits on companies selling private 
medigap insurance policies which pick up where medicare leaves 
off 
it was very very easy to get bipartisan agreement on the 
changes which among other things require these companies to pay 
65 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums and to guarantee 
that policies are renewable rockefeller said 
if private insurers do not change their ways and make a 
contribution to controlling the cost of health care congress will 
do it for them he said 
if they bring congress a proposal that continues to permit 
insurance companies to deny coverage and charge widely varying 
premiums based on health status they will be making an egregious 
error rockefeller said 
that will send the message that their industry intends to 
pursue business as usual he told a media forum on health care 
issues 
however rockefeller also said the health insurance industry 
is working very hard to satisfy congress 
indeed james dorsch washington counsel for the health 
insurance association of america said we know the status quo 
cant continue to that end he said the association has offered 
several proposals to congress to make health insurance more 
accessible to small employers 
some of these changes have been enacted in connecticut he said 
the association is working with other states and we will be back 
to congress next year dorsch said 
he also said insurance companies have been making strides to 
contain health care costs through managed care programs in 
which insurers attempt to assure that effective care is being 
delivered 
americans will pay more than 600 billion this year for health 
care 
still more than 30 million people have no health insurance and 
do not qualify for public programs many are forced to rely on 
hospital emergency rooms for conditions that could have been 
prevented with earlier care or could be delivered more efficiently 
and inexpensively in a doctors office 
rockefeller headed the bipartisan pepper commission which last 
march recommended a 66 billion publicprivate plan to provide 
health care to nearly all americans it also included some 
insurance industry changes 
the senator said he and other lawmakers of both parties are 
starting to draft some of those insurance changes into a 
legislative bill 
he said that any proposals the industry offer will have to 
have to adhere to standards that are very close or exactly what the 
pepper commission recommended 
these would prohibit private insurers from denying coverage for 
preexisting conditions and require them to accept anyone who wants 
insurance and to set rates on the same terms to all groups in an 
area 
were basically going to have to get that far to have true 
health insurance reform rockefeller said 
if by the end of the decade the health care crisis persists the 
american people will lose confidence in the current publicprivate 
system and we will go to national health insurance he said

the federal communications commission says 
its taking aim at toybased television programs but critics claim 
the agencys action misses the mark 
the commission on thursday proposed a new definition of a 
programlength commercial which is what critics say makes up 
much of childrens tv 
the critics cite the likes of heman and gi joe 
saying these programs are thinly disguised 30minute sales pitches 
that drive out quality kids shows they have urged the fcc to put 
the brakes on such shows 
but the fcc wont go that far 
the mere fact that a story line is built around a toy 
being sold on the market would not make it a programlength 
commercial regina harrison an attorney in the fccs mass media 
bureau said after the fcc voted 50 to adopt a new definition of 
programlength commercials 
harrison added that the commission was twisting and turning 
trying to reach a definition that wont cut out shows such as 
sesame street 
the fcc under orders from congress to complete a 3yearold 
investigation into toybased programs proposed to define 
programlength commercials as any childrens show associated with 
a product in which commercials for that product are aired 
previously the commission defined programlength commercials as 
material so interwoven with and in essence auxiliary to the 
sponsors advertising that the entire program is in effect a 
commercial the fcc said thursday that the new definition 
appeared to be in harmony with the traditional definition 
but peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
in cambridge mass said the fcc was trying to adopt a definition 
that would avoid the issue of programs promoting toys 
she said toy manufacturers dont put commercials into shows on 
which their toys are based because kids tend not to notice the ads 
the commercial gets lost she said in a telephone interview 
a gi joe commercial for instance sticks out much better in 
my little pony she added 
the commission invited public comment on what penalties if any 
should be imposed on programlength commercials it may decide that 
such programs violate new advertising time limits that congress 
also ordered the fcc to impose as part of the childrens television 
act of 1990 
the commission on thursday also proposed to implement the ad 
time limits 105 minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and 
12 minutes per hour on weekdays on kids shows including cable tv 
violations of the rules to take effect in april could lead to 
fines ranging from 25000 to 250000 
the commission lifted similar restrictions in 1984 and congress 
later was told that advertising on some programs increased to 14 
minutes per hour a federal appeals court in 1987 ordered the fcc 
to reconsider its decision 
the commission also said it will consider during license renewal 
whether a station has provided programs specifically designed to 
meet the educational and informational needs of children 
president bush citing first amendment concerns allowed the 
measure to become law last month without his signature 
the commission said children would be defined as age 12 or under 
for advertising purposes for programming it said it would 
consider expanding the limit above 12 which critics argue would 
make it too easy for broadcasters to claim they were meeting the 
needs of kids 
the commission also said that besides a stations own kids 
programs it also would consider at license renewal a stations 
nonprogramming actions giving money to support public tv 
educational programs for example

a plan to save philadelphia from bankruptcy 
would plug a shortterm cash shortage and address a projected 
2064 million deficit this year in the citys general fund budget 
the plan scheduled to be unveiled this afternoon was also 
expected to contain such measures as a 1 percent local sales tax 
spending cuts sale of cityowned assets and a financial oversight 
mechanism outside city government 
to avert the cash shortage the longawaited plan reportedly 
includes shortterm borrowing of up to 350 million from the citys 
15 billion pension fund state treasury and local banks 
state house speaker robert w odonnell said he expects to 
announce the plan today along with mayor w wilson goode and other 
leaders he said many of the plans details could change once they 
reach lawmakers 
what weve done is go down into details far enough to get a 
sense that it can be done without specifying as part of the 
agreement that this is the way it will be done he said thursday 
the sales tax for example could end up being another type of tax 
as long as it accomplishes the same goal he said 
city council members however have denounced the package as 
vague and inadequate the philadelphia inquirer said in todays 
editions 
the citys shortterm cash shortage has threatened to force a 
halt in payments next month to city vendors and employees the plan 
would address that problem and look at longterm problems 
contributing to the deficit in the citys 219 billion general 
fund budget 
officials also have sought higher state support for court costs 
and for prorams that serve abused and neglected children 
the city needs money to tide the city over until spring when 
major tax payments are due in september the city was snubbed by 
wall street when it tried to float 375 million in temporary loan 
notes 
bondrating agencies have lowered the citys debt to the lowest 
among major us cities they have urged city and state leaders to 
cooperate to find permanent solutions 
philadelphia is not the only city in the state with fiscal woes 
in scranton a court denial of the citys request to float a 45 
million bond issue may put half of the 650 municipal employees out 
of work monday city officials there said thursday 
scranton mayor james connors said the city which had to win 
court approval because the money would be used for payroll 
expenses now has only enough money to meet its payroll this week

a judge has dismissed part of a washington state 
lawsuit against fashion retailer nordstrom inc but left intact 
the states effort to collect back wages for employees who claim 
they were coerced into working unpaid overtime 
the state department of labor and industries in february found 
that nordstrom had violated state labor laws by failing to pay some 
employees for such things as attending company meetings writing 
customer thank you notes and making deliveries 
nordstrom admitted there were some errors in tracking employee 
time and established a 15 million reserve to pay workers but the 
company denied deliberate violations of wage and hour laws it sued 
labor and industries contending the departments findings denied 
them due process 
the state countersued in april and asked that nordstrom be 
forced to pay damages double the amount of money owed workers that 
amount has not been determined 
acting on a motion by nordstrom to dismiss the departments 
lawsuit king county superior court judge susan agid on thursday 
ruled the state couldnt collect damages or constrain the way 
nordstrom pays its employees in the future 
but agid upheld the departments efforts to collect back pay for 
perhaps hundreds of nordstrom employees in washington state that 
labor and industries contends were coerced to work without pay 
we certainly were pleased with where the judge went with her 
ruling nordstrom spokesman dave marriott said the state was 
seeking pretty broad authority 
jim robart an attorney for nordstrom called agids decision 
a major victory 
we were unable to get everything tossed out today but we were 
able to get threequarters of it he said 
state attorneys indicated they may appeal 
without the ability to seek injunctions labor and industries 
would have the power only to enforce labor laws after the damage 
has been done said paul triesch assistant state attorney 
general the limitation on damages also reduced the leverage the 
department can wield to enforce its findings triesch said 
agids ruling was the latest in a series of decisions stemming 
from various legal actions filed by the state nordstrom and the 
united food and commercial workers union ufcw is bargaining agent 
for about 2000 nordstrom workers although fewer than half belong 
to the union 
last week national labor relations board lawyers rejected 
appeals by ufcw local 1001 to overturn settlements between the 
retail clothing chain and the federal agency 
in the settlements nordstrom had agreed to post notices 
promising not to penalize employees for union activity not to 
bargain with workers directly rather than through the union and not 
to withhold information rightfully sought by the union for 
negotiations 
after the notices have been posted for 60 days the chain may be 
found in compliance with the settlement said john nelson nlrb 
regional director 
at that point nordstrom employees could begin circulating 
petitions for an election on whether to retain the union but local 
1001 president joe peterson said the decertification effort would 
be blocked by new unfair labor practice charges to be filed within 
two weeks 
nordstrom has about five dozen stores in washington state 
oregon california utah alaska virginia and new jersey 
its dispute with the union arose 1 years ago during contract 
talks covering sales clerks in five stores in seattle and one in 
tacoma nordstrom negotiators refused to accept renewal of a 
provision that required employees covered by the contract to belong 
to the union and the contract expired july 31 1989 
last winter the union sued seeking more than 300 million in 
back pay for about 30000 nordstrom employees nationwide 
a separate but similar union complaint resulted in the state 
department of labor and industries ruling in february and its 
subsequent countersuit against the company 
also pending is a federal lawsuit by three stockholders who said 
the labor battle had cost them financial losses and claimed company 
officers failed to disclose those problems

bethlehem steel corp reacting to weak 
conditions in the steel market said it would cut in half an 8 
percent price increase scheduled for sheet steel shipments after 
dec 29 
the move is expected to be followed by other major steelmakers 
who have announced similar price increases in an effort to shore up 
eroding profits 
this action is being taken to better reflect the realities of 
the marketplace bethlehem spokesman henry h von spreckelsen 
said thursday 
the sheet steel used for autos appliances and construction 
materials is produced at bethlehem steels burns harbor ind 
and sparrows point md plants 
the original price hike was announced in september but 
customers asked for a reprieve von spreckelsen said 
at an appropriate time in months ahead customers can expect 
an additional increase to offset rising costs he said 
a usx spokesman declined to say whether the nations no 1 steel 
maker would follow bethlehems lead however charles bradford a 
steel analyst with ubs securities in new york said usx and other 
steel makers have little choice 
he said the 8 percent increases announced by steel makers were 
kind of joke in the first place 
i dont think too many people really expected to get that 
much he said but if you dont ask for more you dont get 
anything 
bradford said steel makers need price relief to cover increased 
costs and wage hikes that go into effect jan 1 
bethlehem steel reported earnings of 533 million for the first 
nine months of 1990 compared to earnings of 1957 million in the 
same period of 1989 
under the new schedule the price increase on hotrolled steel 
would be lowered to 20 from 35 a ton on coldrolled steel to 25 
from 47 a ton and on galvanized steel to 30 from 49 a ton

wholesale prices in october soared for the 
third consecutive month the government said today as the fear of 
war in the persian gulf kept energy costs rising 
the labor department said its producer price index for finished 
goods one stop short of retail jumped 11 percent last month 
after rising 16 percent in september and 13 percent in august 
the threemonth jolt brought producer price inflation for the 
first 10 months of 1990 to a 7 percent annual rate thats sharply 
higher than the 49 percent rate for all of last year is the worst 
since prices soared 71 percent in 1981 
if wholesale inflation were to continue at the october rate for 
12 consecutive months the annual rate would be 137 percent 
however most economists expect energy inflation to moderate 
soon barring the outbreak of war in the middle east or if saudi 
arabian oil production facilities manage to survive a short war 
relatively intact 
in october as in august and september energy prices led the 
index higher rising 8 percent compared with a 09 percent increase 
for food the worst since january and no net change in the 
prices of all other items 
still it was better than the 138 percent rise in energy costs 
in september and the 95 percent increase a month before that 
as temperatures across much of the north turned chillier fuel 
oil prices rose 15 percent and were 675 percent higher than a year 
earlier natural gas costs however edged down 03 percent 
gasoline prices increased 8 percent bringing the level to 502 
percent higher than a year before 
food prices meanwhile turned significantly higher led by a 
95 percent increase for eggs an 82 percent rise for pork and a 
51 percent advance for beef and veal and turkeys costs also rose 
for vegetables and pasta 
the increases were only partly offset by declines in the prices 
of fresh fruit rice chickens fish dairy products coffee and 
cooking oils 
economists were encouraged by the lack of inflation outside the 
volatile food and energy sectors taking it as a sign that the 
sluggish economy is keeping a lid on price pressures 
the socalled core rate of inflation excluding food and energy 
is considered a better barometer of underlying inflation trends 
the good news is the bad news could have been much worse 
said ron schreibman vice president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors the overall report is much higher than 
expected but the good news is that core prices remain unchanged 
the price of passenger cars fell 27 percent other declines 
were recorded for mens and boys clothing floor coverings and 
household flatware 
prices rose 34 percent for newspapers and were also up for 
books sanitary papers womens clothing cosmetics tobacco and 
jewelry 
the various changes left the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1223 in october that means that a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 cost 12230 last month up 
from 11470 a year earlier 
inflation at earlier stages of the production process was also 
up sharply driven by energy prices rose 15 percent for 
intermediate goods and 87 percent for crude goods but excluding 
energy and food prices rose only 04 percent at the intermediate 
level and fell 17 percent at the crude level 
crude petroleum prices jumped 292 percent in october and were 
double the level of a year ago 
an example of the three processing stages would be bread for 
finished flour for intermediate and wheat for crude 
economist samuel kahan of fuji securities inc predicted a 
quarterpoint cut in the federal funds rate the rate banks charge 
each other for overnight loans to 7 percent by early december 
the economy looks like its weakening and i think they want to 
provide the cushion to prevent it from becoming a sliding 
collapse kahan said

two government agencies are expected to seek up 
to 10 billion against drexel burnham lambert inc for alleged 
fraud in junk bond dealings with several savings and loans sources 
said today 
the federal deposit insurance corp and the resolution trust 
corp have until next thursday to file claims against the collapsed 
wall street firm now in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
the filings are expected to seek from 5 billion to 10 billion 
for losses incurred by several major savings and loans from 
investments in highyield securities marketed by drexel people 
with knowledge of the agencies plans said 
the total is expected to reflect a tripling of damages based an 
allegations of antitrust law violations people involved in the 
talks said the fdic insures deposits for the nations savings and 
loans while resolution trust oversees the federal thrift bailout 
lawyers for drexel and investors exclients and government 
agencies are negotiating over the total compensation to be alloted 
in drexels bankruptcy court reorganization about 100 civil 
securities fraud lawsuits nationwide are outstanding 
the claims allege stock manipulation racketeering insider 
trading and numerous other crimes by drexel and its junkbond 
department led by convicted financier michael milken litigated 
separately they would take 10 years or more to resolve 
instead attorneys plan to negotiate an estimate of maximum 
damages drexel should pay a figure would have to be approved by 
us district judge milton pollack and would be included in a 
reorganization plan to pay drexel creditors 
its a major stumbling block to the plan drexel lawyer alan 
miller said you have to figure out how much you owe how high is 
up and you have to figure out how to get it done in our 
lifetime 
final damage awards will likely be only a fraction of the 
billions of dollars being sought because of drexels limited 
assets lawyers said 
the claims include class actions by shareholders of companies 
that did business with drexel or whose securities were affected by 
drexel deals individual firms and federal agencies 
the negotiations do not cover 200 arbitration disputes and 
another 100 lawsuits alleging wrongdoing other than securities 
fraud which also must be addressed in the bankruptcy 
drexel already has agreed to pay 350 million into a civil 
restitution fund to compensate investors harmed by its actions the 
securities and exchange commission is trying to recover 150 
million drexel still owes the fund which was formed as part of its 
1989 guilty plea to six felony crimes 
if the civil litigation settlement exceeds 350 million which 
is likely drexel will be liable for the rest the litigation 
automatically came to a halt when drexel filed for chapter 11 on 
feb 13 
us bankruptcy judge frank conrad recently also froze lawsuits 
naming current and former drexel employees but not the firm most 
of those claims involve milken to be sentenced next week on his 
guilty plea to six tradingrelated felony counts 
drexel lawyers requested that freeze on grounds a liability 
finding against a drexel employee could be binding on the firm 
also information discovered in preparing civil cases against 
outside parties could turn up evidence against drexel 
if mike milken said i didnt do it but drexel did he has 
now accomplished what the plaintiffs wanted to accomplish miller 
said 
thats not an unlikely scenario during a special court hearing 
on unadmitted charges against milken his lawyers said in one case 
that a stock was manipulated and milken didnt do it but someone 
else at drexel did 
but richard kirby the secs senior litigation counsel said the 
freeze is delaying compensation to investors in cases only 
indirectly related to the drexel bankruptcy 
you have victims of securities fraud who cant collect 
money because drexel is taking its sweet time figuring out how to 
shape up its own affairs he said thursday if a plaintiff can 
prove a case against mike milken he ought to be able to collect 
against mike milken 
melvyn weiss lead attorney in 16 fraud lawsuits said lawyers 
were hamstrung by the freeze but developing their cases as much as 
possible pending a ruling by judge pollack 
a reorganization plan would establish how much drexels 
creditors receive when the firm emerges from bankruptcy and whether 
unsecured creditors such as former employees who owned company 
stock get anything 
drexel currently is paying only operating expenses on a 
300person staff down from more than 10000 at its peak a total 
of 19 drexelrelated entities are involved in the bankruptcy legal 
fees in the first three months of the case totaled nearly 47 
million 
about 15 drexel professionals are managing the firms junkbond 
portfolio but not selling many securities because of the markets 
collapse the bulk of drexel staff handles bankruptcyrelated 
administrative and financial matters 
drexel has vacated all but 130000 of 15 million square feet of 
office space almost all remaining employees are at the firms new 
york headquarters with a handful at a small los angeles office

a bumper corn harvest this fall is leading the 
way for the largest total crop output by american farmers in five 
years the agriculture department says 
the 1990 corn harvest was estimated thursday at a fouryear high 
of 793 billion bushels up 5 percent from last year although down 
slightly from prospects in october 
an allcrops production index was reported at 112 percent of its 
1977 average used for comparison that was up one percentage point 
from october and the highest reading since the index averaged 116 
percent in 1985 
the latest corn production outlook based on nov 1 indications 
was down 1 percent from usdas october forecast the harvest was 
about 64 percent completed by oct 28 slightly behind normal 
many growers continue to report yields lower than previously 
anticipated the departments agricultural statistics board said 
ears in lateplanted fields in indiana did not fill out corn 
borers also did considerable damage in illinois 
farmers harvested 753 billion bushels in 1989 and the 
department in its initial 1990 forecast on aug 9 put this falls 
harvest at 785 billion bushels 
the forecast was raised on sept 12 to 812 billion bushels and 
then lowered to 802 billion on oct 11 
at 793 billion bushels this years harvest still would be the 
largest since farmers produced 823 billion bushels in 1986 
according to usda records 
based on the latest surveys the average corn yield nationally 
was estimated at 119 bushels per acre harvested compared with 
1162 last year and 1203 indicated last month the record was 
1194 bushels in 1987 
as livestock feed corn is the largest and most important us 
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat poultry and 
dairy products 
consumer food prices which rose an average of 58 percent in 
1989 the sharpest yeartoyear increase since 1981 are expected 
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990 
soybean production a source of highprotein meal and vegetable 
oil was estimated at 19 billion bushels down 1 percent from last 
years harvest of 193 billion bushels but 4 percent more than the 
october forecast of 182 billion bushels 
cotton production was indicated at 149 million bales up 22 
percent from last years output of 122 million bales and 2 percent 
more than the october forecast 
no new estimates of 1990 production of wheat and other crops 
harvested earlier were included in the report 
the fall crop of potatoes was estimated for the first time this 
season at 342 million hundredweight up 5 percent from last year 
due to an increase in acreage average yields were forecast at 298 
hundredweight per acre down one hundredweight from 1989 
drought in north dakota and minnesota cut into production 
potential for the third straight year the report said maine 
farmers were hit by heavy october rains followed by hard freezes 
late in the month that virtually shut down harvest operations 
the potato outlook also was said to be hurt by extremely 
variable temperatures in idaho oregon and washington during the 
growing season 
in a related supplyanddemand report analysts said total corn 
use in the 199091 marketing year that began sept 1 is expected to 
be about 8045 billion bushels 
with use exceeding estimated production the us corn stockpile 
may decline to a projected 1236 billion bushels by sept 1 1991 
compared with 1344 billion this sept 1 
the report said corn prices at the farm may average 220 to 
260 per bushel in the 199091 marketing year down from 236 in 
198990 and unchanged from the october projection 
soybean prices were indicated to average 535 to 635 per 
bushel down from the october range of 570 to 7 per bushel 
this falls larger than expected crop is putting pressure on 
prices and will mean a rise in soybean stockpiles in 199091 by 
next sept 1 the report said soybean inventories could be around 
255 million bushels compared with 239 million bushels this sept 1 
and last months projection of 175 million bushels next year 
the report also showed the soviet unions grain harvest at 235 
million metric tons this year unchanged from the october forecast 
however analysts said soviet grain imports in 199091 now are 
expected to be 28 million tons down from 30 million anticipated 
last month

soybean futures prices fell sharply this morning 
on the chicago board of trade after the government raised its 1990 
harvest estimate by more than 4 percent to a higherthanexpected 
19 billion bushels

crop estimate in thursdays monthly agriculture department crop 
report 
most analysts had expected the usdas increase in its soybean

of 182 billion 
the government also raised its estimate of how large the us 
soybean stockpile will be next aug 31 the end of the current 
marketing year to 255 million bushels from 175 million 
that projection reversed the usdas october prediction that the 
soybean stockpile would shrink from last augusts carryout of 239 
million bushels 
not only is it adequate but it starts to border on 
burdensome said doug jackson grains analyst with farmers 
commodities corp in des moines iowa 
the usda lowered its corn production estimate from 8 billion to 
79 billion bushels but selling pressure for the soybean pit 
overshadowed that ostensibly bullish factor at the opening

bond issues that would have borrowed billions of 
dollars to preserve open spaces and clean the environment went the 
way of plastic foam hamburger boxes this past week 
voters in new york state tuesday rejected a 19 billion bond 
package that would have spent most of its money to buy and set 
aside adirondack woodland and establish solidwaste programs in 
california the big green environmental proposal which would 
have raised money for forest protection such as 300 million to 
buy stands of ancient redwoods was defeated 
people first and foremost are concerned with economic 
events said neal atterman municipal research director at 
kidder peabody amp co look at consumer confidence then put that 
into a voting booth connotation people dont want radical changes 
right now 
california attorney general john van de kamp a primary sponsor 
of the environmental measure there also said voters were showing a 
move toward fiscal conservatism 
i think the invasion of kuwait the beginning of the 
recession the national budget crisis the state budget crisis 
all those things have scared people he said 
environmental issues werent the only bond questions turned 
away voters rejected 435 percent of the proposed bond issues 
amounting to 595 percent of the total dollar value of bonds on 
tuesdays ballot according to the bond buyer the municipal bond 
market daily newspaper 
voters approved 242 state and local government bond issues 
totaling 4887 billion out of 428 issues totaling 12067 billion 
the bond buyer reported the percentage of approvals was the lowest 
in a general election since 10 percent were approved in 1975 the 
newspaper said 
in last years general election 857 percent of the 668 
billion of bond issues on ballots were approved 
a lot of it is probably related to the economy it may also be 
related to the federal tax increase people think we cant afford 
to borrow said claire cohen head of government finance at fitch 
investors service inc a bond rating agency 
other analysts like george friedlander head of municipal 
research at smith barney harris upham amp co said the heavy 
rejection of bond issues this year was a sign voters didnt trust 
political leaders to spend the money wisely 
bonds that would have funded affordable housing and public 
facilities were turned away but voters were more receptive to 
issues for education health care and transportation 
in massachusetts voters rejected a plan that would have cut tax 
revenues by 135 billion this fiscal year 
i think that whats going on is very positive atterman 
said voters are concerned about the future and want to keep 
public debt lower rather than higher 
analysts said voters showed they were selective about the issues 
they approved with california voters giving the goahead to 800 
million school construction issue and defeating more than 
threefourths of the 5279 billion worth of proposed bonds 
the heavy drubbing bonds took should not have a major impact on 
the already shortsupply municipal bond market friedlander said 
the vast majority of municipal bonds are not decided at 
elections he said

the national plans to discontinue its sunday 
issue next month and publish five rather than six days a week the 
editor in chief of the ninemonthold sports daily said today 
editor frank deford also said there may be a handful of jobs 
cut at the newspaper but that he was hopeful the number would be so 
small that it could be absorbed through attrition rather than 
layoffs 
there is a feeling that as in practically every other business 
in america we should tighten our belts deford said in a 
telephone interview 
deford denied that the newspaper was in serious financial 
trouble as it tries to become the first national sports daily in 
america its just a matter of belttightening he said 
on thursday a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the sunday issue was being discontinued because circulation on 
sundays has amounted to only about 80 percent of that on weekdays 
and it has proven harder to distribute the paper on sundays than on 
weekdays 
the national has been published six days a week sunday through 
friday since it was launched on jan 31 
deford said the last sunday issue will be published on the 
sunday after thanksgiving 
the newspaper is owned by a partnership led by mexican media 
baron emilio azcarraga repeated calls seeking comment were made to 
publisher peter o price but they were not returned 
the paper started out with editions in three markets new york 
chicago and los angeles but six other markets have been added 
since then 
the other editions are in san diego san francisco dallas 
detroit boston and miami the newsapaper has announced plans to 
begin another edition in the baltimorewashington metropolitan area 
in early december and an edition in philadelphia in january 
the newspapers arrival was met with considerable skepticism 
about whether there are enough readers and advertisers to support a 
daily newspaper devoted exclusively to sports 
the launch also coincided with a sharp decline in the 
advertising market for newspapers in many parts of the country that 
has shown no signs of abating 
but azcarraga and his partners reportedly went into the 
enterprise prepared to spend 100 million and several years in 
making the newspaper profitable 
the source who told of the plans to end the sunday edition said 
the decision was not a sign that the paper was in danger of 
folding 
my sense of it is that it is a very viable concern he said 
he said ending the sunday issue was part of the normal 
shakedown that occurs in finding a sensible production schedule

former denver developer bill walters who defaulted on 106 
million in loans from silverado savings and loan has filed for 
personal bankruptcy in santa ana calif claiming 196 million in 
debts 
nathan jones a san diego attorney representing walters in the 
us bankruptcy court filing said thursday that creditors include 
manufacturers hanover trust co mellon bank silverado and 
walters exwife mary lou 
jones said creditors probably will only get a fraction of what 
they are owed 
there are a few assets available possibly a few hundred 
thousand dollars said jones bill is a good guy who has gotten 
a lot of bad publicity he was at the end of his rope 
during early and mid1980s walters was one of denvers highest 
profile developers he listed his net worth at 200 million during 
those years 
but the oil bust took its toll on his real estate and banking 
holdings he sold cherry creek national bank in 1988 and it failed 
last month his other two banks failed in 1987 
earlier this year walters told a congressional panel 
investigating silverados 1 billion failure that he was broke but 
vowed not to seek bankruptcy protection and to pay back what he 
owed the thrift 
but a few weeks later he was found to be living in a 19 
million estate in newport beach calif listed in the name of his 
wife jacqueline 
walters became a prominent figure in the nations thrift crisis 
because of his business relationship with president bushs son 
neil a silverado director bush voted to approve 106 million in 
loans to walters who defaulted on the loans 
the bankruptcy filing says he owes manufacturers hanover 111 
million and mellon bank 23 million jones said walters owes 
silverado 185 million and mary lou walters about 535 million 
jones said walters has no personal obligation to pay many of the 
loans from silverado and thus owes only a fraction of the 106 
million on which he defaulted

two men were charged with fraud in an 
alleged insider trading scheme in which prosecutors claim they 
traded stocks based on information obtained from advance copies of 
business week magazine 
benjamin b libera 35 and francis r sablone 41 each were 
charged with one count of conspiracy prosecutors said libera also 
was charged with 45 counts of mail fraud and 55 counts of 
securities fraud sablone was charged with 26 counts of mail fraud 
and 58 counts of securities fraud 
sablones attorney james wade said friday his client denies 
any role in the alleged scheme he asserts vigorously his 
innocence and indeed we raise the question as to whether or not a 
crime took place at all wade said 
the indictment returned thursday by a federal grand jury in new 
haven alleges that between october 1986 and july 1988 libera and 
sablone engaged in a scheme to trade securities based on 
information from the inside wall street column in copies of 
business week magazine not yet released to the general public 
the two men allegedly paid 20 to 30 to employees of the 
magazines printing company rr donnelley amp sons of old 
saybrook in exchange for advance copies of the magazine said us 
attorney stanley a twardy jr 
the indictment alleges the magazines were delivered to libera 
and sablone every thursday morning the magazine is released to the 
general public later in the day 
companies receiving favorable mention in the column often see 
their stock price rise temporarily by obtaining the column early 
the two allegedly were able to get a jump on the market by trading 
the stocks of companies in the column the indictment alleges that 
sablone grossed 75079 and that libera grossed 113806 as a 
result of the early trades 
each of the charges carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in 
prison and a 250000 fine 
attempts to reach libera and sablone were unsuccessful

the vast majority of top economists in a 
monthly survey believe a recession will begin before years end 
but most predict it will be brief and relatively mild a prominent 
economic newsletter reported friday 
blue chip economic indicators said 80 percent of the 55 
economists in its survey feel a downturn will start before the end 
of 1990 another 5 percent said the slump would start in 1991 
it now seems very likely that americas longest peacetime 
expansion is about to come to an end wrote blue chip editor 
robert j eggert of eggert economic enterprises inc in sedona 
ariz 
even president bush while avoiding the use of the word 
recession acknowledged at a thursday news conference that were 
in for some tough times right now 
and michael boskin bushs chief economic adviser said thursday 
the economy could slip into negative territory this year 
the economy at best is in a lull but we do expect that lull 
to be relatively brief and relatively minor boskin told the 
american council for capital formation here 
the blue chip survey found threefourths of the respondents 
expect any downturn to last no more than two or three quarters 
an even larger majority 82 percent anticipate that the 
recession will be relatively mild the newsletter said 
because of the predicted slump the newsletters masthead was 
printed in red ink for the first time since the last recession a 
warning that economic growth may drop below zero a recession 
generally is defined as two consecutive quarterly economic 
declines 
since the economy emerged from the july 1981november 1982 
downturn the blue chip banner has been either green or yellow 
green meant the economy was expanding above longrange growth 
potential of 3 percent while yellow warned that economic growth 
was lagging between zero and 29 percent 
the surveys consensus forecast anticipated a 08 percent annual 
rate of decline during the current quarter followed by a 06 
percent drop from january through march 1991 
it projected growth picking up 08 percent 21 percent and 25 
percent in the following quarters 
the survey participants represent many of the nations top 
banks brokerage companies corporations economic forecasting 
organizations and universities 
however there are dissenting economists 
lawrence kudlow a top reagan administration economist now with 
bear stearns amp co told the us chamber of commerce on thursday 
he foresees no offthecliff recession 
but he said he wouldnt be surprised to see a negative fourth 
quarter before the economy picked up to a 2 percent growth rate for 
1991 
stephen s roach of morgan stanley amp co also says the economy 
could fall during the current quarter but added we are not 
projecting two consecutive quarters of declining gnp 
the gross national product the nations broadest measure of 
economic activity is the nations total output of goods and 
services 
the consensus forecast in the blue chip survey calls for 1 
percent growth this year in the gnp it grew 17 percent at an 
annual rate in the first quarter followed by 04 percent and 18 
percent rates in the next two 
but expectations for growth in 1991 continued to slide 
dropping threetenths of a percentage point to a paltry 05 
percent 
and the newsletter reported the outlook for inflation also 
continued on the gloomy side with the consensus estimate for the 
annualized rate of increase in the consumer price index for the 
current quarter jumping to 71 percent 
that would push the inflation rate for the year to 55 percent 
however the inflation rate would slow to a 52 percent increase 
during 1991

fear of war in the persian gulf jolted oil 
prices for the third straight month in october but slowing 
economic growth held wholesale price inflation for nonfood and 
nonenergy items to zero 
the labor department said friday that its producer price index 
for finished goods one step short of retail jumped a seasonally 
adjusted 11 percent last month 
that followed increases of 16 percent in september and 13 
percent in august bringing the annual inflation rate for the year 
so far to levels not seen in nine years 
wholesale price inflation on an annual basis was 7 percent for 
the first 10 months of 1990 the highest since a 71 percent rise 
in 1981 
even though the october number was higher than the predicted 07 
percent rise stock and bond markets rallied immediately after the 
report because prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors 
were unchanged this socalled core inflation rate is 
considered a better indicator of longterm inflationary trends 
traders took the absence of core inflation as a sign the federal 
reserve board likely would stimulate the economy with lower 
interest rates after its policymakers meet tuesday 
economists are optimistic that despite the sharp rises of the 
last three months inflation will remain under control unless war 
in the middle east destroys saudi arabias oilproduction 
facilities the economy is simply too weak for most goods producers 
to pass on higher energy costs they say

in fact the latest edition of a prominent survey of private 
economists said the nation likely will topple into a recession 
before the end of the year 
blue chip economic indicators of sedona ariz reported friday 
that 44 of the 55 economists in its survey believe a downturn will 
start before the end of 1990 another three said the slump would

the climate is not going to be favorable for an increase in 
inflation said economist robert g dederick of northern trust 
co in chicago were in a bad inflation patch now but well get 
through it 
in october energy costs led prices higher rising 8 percent 
compared with 138 percent in september and 95 percent the month 
before that 
fuel oil prices rose 15 percent and were 675 percent higher 
than a year earlier natural gas costs however edged down 03 
percent 
gasoline prices increased 8 percent and were 502 percent higher 
than a year earlier 
food prices meanwhile rose 09 percent the biggest increase 
since unseasonably cold weather froze southern fruit and vegetable 
crops in january 
egg costs were up 95 percent pork 82 percent and beef and 
turkeys 51 percent prices also rose for vegetables and pasta 
economist donald ratajczak said consumers demand for red meat 
has fallen about as much as is likely and farmers are building 
their herds in anticipation of growing demand that means they are 
sending fewer animals to slaughter pushing prices higher 
the increases were partly offset by declines in the prices of 
fresh fruit rice chickens fish dairy products coffee and 
cooking oils 
in other categories the price of passenger cars fell 27 
percent after jumping 34 percent a month earlier economists 
attributed the fluctuations to the fact that price increases and 
discounts this year have been out of sync with auto dealers usual 
seasonal pattern 
other declines were recorded for mens and boys clothing floor 
coverings and household flatware prices rose 34 percent for 
newspapers and were also up for books womens clothing cosmetics 
tobacco and jewelry 
the various changes left the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1223 in october that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 12230 
last month up from 11470 a year earlier 
prices at earlier stages of the production process were also up 
sharply driven by energy prices rose 15 percent for 
intermediatelevel goods and 87 percent for crudelevel goods 
excluding energy and food however prices rose only 04 percent at 
the intermediate level and fell 17 percent at the crude level 
crude petroleum prices jumped 292 percent in october and were 
double the level of a year ago 
an example of the three processing stages would be bread for 
finished flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

depressed business across wall street has 
triggered a round of severe cuts that for the first time is digging 
sharply into the highprofile fields of the booming 1980s and 
leaving many senior executives unemployed 
the reversal of fortune has caused punishing losses and pushed a 
few firms into bankruptcy eliminated tens of thousands of jobs 
dried up key moneymaking areas and deflated the image of wall 
street pros as masters of the universe 
in the last two weeks alone 
merrill lynch amp co fired 50 investment bankers reducing the 
department to 575 from about 700 at the beginning of 1990 the 
nations biggest securities firm has eliminated 2300 jobs this 
year no 2 shearson lehman holdings inc has cut 3000 
first boston corp laid off 45 workers from its 475person 
stock division bringing a weeks firings to about 100 hundreds 
more layoffs are expected there by yearend 
bear stearns amp co let go 10 investment bankers from a staff 
of around 200 prudentialbache securities inc fired 120 of 180 
investment bankers and revered morgan stanley amp co pared 50 
bankers 6 percent of its force other firms are firing 
professionals in small increments 
wall street executives say rumors of further layoffs have 
triggered paranoia that is hurting firms ability to do what 
limited business exists salaries and bonuses are forecast to drop 
sharply unlike earlier cuts senior managers and partners are 
being let go 
everyone is looking behind them to see if the ax is coming at 
his head said joan zimmerman executive vice president with gz 
stephens inc a recruiting firm 
you have an immense morale problem right now she said 
when people are this insecure their ability to go out and 
generate business and concentrate on the business at hand drops 
dramatically 
nationwide more than 45000 securities industry jobs have been 
cut since the october 1987 stock market crash the latest 
reductions focus on highly paid investment bankers who handled the 
large mergers and takeovers of the 1980s but have seen their 
business evaporate 
the value of us mergers and acquisitions in the first 10 
months of 1990 was down 50 percent compared with the same period 
last year according to idd information services a research and 
publishing concern 
idd said 3575 deals valued at 1859 billion were completed 
from january through october vs 4273 valued at 3734 billion in 
the same 1989 period the drop was most severe in deals worth more 
than 50 million where investment firms make the most lucrative 
fees 
crucial fees from underwriting stocks and bonds plummeted to 
15 billion in the first nine months of 1990 down 30 percent from 
a year earlier and the lowest level since 1984 according to 
securities data co 
the lack of mergers and underwriting by us companies is blamed 
on a slow economy declining stock market volume and insecurity 
about the future in large part because of the middle east crisis 
analysts projections on further securities industry layoffs 
range from at least 10000 to as many as 40000 
if 91 turns out to be the way the last couple months have 
been then youll probably see much more said lawrence 
eckenfelder of prudentialbache i would say that 91 would have 
to be the washout year 
several wall street executives said the degree of layoffs was 
exaggerated because financial firms typically pare staffing in the 
fourth quarter to plan for next year cynics say its cheaper to 
pay severance than an annual bonus 
people say the environment is rough and tough and i agree 
bear stearns chairman alan c greenberg said that doesnt mean 
it wont change tomorrow 
all agree that wall street firms are adjusting to reality 
following a period of startling growth employment has been reduced 
to 1985 levels but thats still more than 50 percent higher than 
in 1980 
as profits and revenue at top firms sink managers are assessing 
the productivity of certain business lines witness 
prudentialbaches investment banking purge and cutting back 
spending as much as possible 
some executives said the task is made more difficult by the 
uncertain future if firms scale back too much will they be 
prepared for a possible rebound 
theres a slowdown but ive seen four or five cycles 
before said william e mayer who this week announced his 
resignation as first bostons head of merchant banking this is 
just nastier and a little longer 
beyond that theres going to be an industry and people are 
going to do well in it he said but thats going to take a 
couple years

usx corp and united steelworkers union 
negotiators gave no hint friday on the fate of a new contract for 
18000 employees as saturdays deadline for reaching an agreement 
approached 
neither the company nor the union would discuss the progress of 
the talks which began oct 15 
i dont know whether well have something over the weekend or 
not said usx spokesman ernie glenn 
failure to strike a deal by saturday would not necessarily be a 
major setback the old contract does not expire until february 
but if the talks drag on the risk of losing customers who fear 
a strike will grow analysts said 
theyve got to settle very very soon to avoid losing a lot of 
business said charles bradford an analyst with ubs securities 
in new york they cant wait until early december the customers 
will put their business elsewhere 
the union wants usx to fall in line with other steel makers who 
restored pay cuts taken by workers during the industrys decline in 
the early 1980s 
the wage concessions made by usx workers average about 130 an 
hour said andrew lefty palm the unions chief negotiator 
greg drahuschak an analyst with butcher amp singer in pittsburgh 
said usx can afford to restore concessions today but could face a 
struggle to pay higher wages if the economy doesnt improve soon 
this business is still highly cyclical he said they have 
tremendous capital costs 
industry steel orders in the past month were about 20 percent 
lower than in the same period of 1989 reflecting high inventories 
a slowdown in construction and some automobile plant closures 
bradford said 
in the third quarter usxs earnings dropped 68 percent from a 
year earlier with gains in the energy segment but a 26 percent 
income drop from the steel division 
most major steel makers earnings have dropped in the past year 
and competitors would eagerly snatch customers from any supplier 
whose ability to produce is interrupted by a strike 
but analysts said they expect no strike at usx this time the 
last fouryear agreement was reached after a sixmonth lockout and 
shutdown of the company in 1986 
neither side wants a strike bradford said both sides 
lost in the strike last time 
ben fischer director of the center for labor studies at 
carnegie mellon university said the early target date signalled 
both sides were feeling confident 
they didnt plan to fail and they dont plan to fail said 
fischer who believes meeting saturdays deadline is not critical 
if they are still meeting if they are continuing to work 
then the particular hours and days are not that critical he 
said the most critical thing is to not give people reason to 
think there will be a strike 
usxs board of directors voted oct 30 to make the steel and 
energy giants steel operations a wholly owned subsidiary in a move 
that could pave the way for a restructuring 
fisher said there was no reason to believe the move would 
jeopardize an agreement 
its not like usx has never had spinoffs and joint ventures 
and to the best of my knowledge none of them have resulted in 
charges the workers actual vested interests have been subverted 
he said

federal savings and loan regulators may seek up 
to 10 billion from drexel burhnam lambert inc for junk bond 
investment losses at more than 20 thrifts people involved in the 
case said friday 
a lawyer for the federal deposit insurance corp and the 
resolution trust corp said very substantial claims would be 
filed next week against the collapsed wall street firm now in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
the agencies are expected to seek 5 billion to 10 billion for 
losses incurred by failed thrifts on investments in highyield debt 
securities handled by drexel an individual familiar with their 
plans said 
the total is expected to reflect tripled damages based an 
allegations of antitrust law violations the individual said the 
fdic insures deposits for the nations savings and loans 
resolution trust oversees the federal thrift bailout 
the agencies plan to allege fraud and other wrongdoing in 
dealings between drexels junk bond department headed by convicted 
financier michael milken and more than 20 savings and loans fdic 
attorney thomas barr said 
barr declined to comment on the size of the potential claims or 
whether they would include antitrust or racketeering charges 
several big savings and loans invested billions of dollars in 
risky highyield securities sold by drexel the junk bond market 
collapsed about a year ago devastating the value of these 
securities 
in papers filed in bankruptcy court barr said resolution trust 
on oct31 had a junk bond portfolio valued at 3 billion to 4 
billion with most of the securities underwritten or managed by 
drexel resolution trust has taken over more than 100 savings and 
loans 
the filings said resolution trust and some of the thrifts have 
been forced to sell large amounts of drexelrelated junk bonds at 
substantial losses 
through their lawyers drexel and milken have denied any role in 
the collapse of the nations savings and loans at a presentencing 
hearing for milken former drexel employees stated that drexel 
engaged in illegal activity with at least one major thrift 
civil lawsuits filed against drexel milken and others have 
alleged widespread junk bond fraud at thrifts including lincoln 
savings amp loan association and columbia savings amp loan association 
separate trials involving those thrifts are scheduled 
drexel is reorganizing under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
law it faces more than 100 civil lawsuits alleging stock 
manipulation racketeering insider trading and numerous other 
crimes by drexel and related entities 
lawyers are negotiating over the total amount to be allotted in 
drexels reorganization to settle the lawsuits by investors 
exclients and others a figure must be approved by us district 
judge milton pollack who is handling the litigation 
the thrift claims are part of those talks in addition the 
internal revenue service also is expected to file a large claim 
against drexel 
drexel attorney alan miller said there wont be anything 
like 5 billion to 10 billion in an agreement settling the civil 
litigation 
he criticized the possible fdic filing as an attempt by one 
creditor to dilute the claims all the other creditors and to 
blame drexel for the thrift collapse 
drexel has about 3 billion in assets and 285 billion in 
existing undisputed claims the assets do not reflect the value of 
the firms junk bond portfolio and stock investments in 
drexelmanaged takeover deals 
in court papers the fdic said its claims would be filed by a 
thursday deadline but asked for 90 more days to complete its 
investigation the fdic charged that drexel was not cooperating 
with its efforts 
the papers said that more than 100 accountants and 50 lawyers 
were investigating the junk bond holdings of failed thrifts 
nationwide and had collected more than five million pages of 
documents 
they said junk bond records of thrifts taken over by resolution 
trust are in a state of some disarray they also charged that 
thrift executives removed boxes of records before the federal 
takeovers and that important employees refused to cooperate with 
the investigation 
claude montgomery a lawyer for former drexel stockholders 
whose claims would be last to be met said a huge demand by the 
thrift agencies could lead to more litigation because some 
numbers are just too big to negotiate 
it does strike many of us that somewhat strange that the rtc 
should be filing claims against an institution on the theory that 
it brought the sampls down he said adding that to blame drexel 
instad of congress and the regulators and 50 years of history is a 
little bit aggressive

qantas airways will reduce its 
workforce by 500 by the end of february to help it survive an 
industrywide downturn prompted by higher jet fuel costs chief 
executive john ward said friday 
ward also said five boeing 747s would be sold earlier than 
planned and flying hours would be cut back as part of a 
costcutting plan 
these steps are essential if we are to survive he said 
adding that more job cuts were inevitable although the number 
depended on the state of the world economies and the impact on 
travel demand 
qantas has said its annual fuel bill would rise by 100 million 
to 200 million australian dollars 78 million to 156 million 
us because of the middle east crisis and its effect on jet fuel 
prices 
the airline 49 percent of which the government plans to sell 
has already axed 60 management jobs and 21 jobs in europe 
it has also frozen staff recruiting and withdrawn services from 
amsterdam athens bombay and bahrain 
were in a critical period ward said small downturns in 
traffic and small increases in costs play havoc with 
profitability 
the international air transport association has predicted 
collective losses of 35 billion us for the worlds airlines 
this year 
later this month qantas is expected to report a small profit 
for the past financial year after some aircraft disposals prevented 
a loss 
ward said qantas had to restructure its operations to ensure it 
can continue to compete on international routes and take full 
advantage of tourism opportunities in the asiapacific region

the government now says the us soybean stockpile is growing 
instead of shrinking but market analysts arent quite ready to 
reverse their predictions for higher soybean prices in the coming 
year 
some experts say it is too early to know whether this years 
largerthanexpected us soybean harvest means prices will 
continue to weaken after the shock of the government latest crop 
report wears off 
but others contend the sixmonth outlook is as bullish as ever 
based mainly on expectations for a small south american soybean 
crop 
they agree that two keys to the markets behavior between now 
and next summer will be the level of export demand for us 
soybeans that develops early next year after current south american 
supplies are depleted and the growing conditions that prevail in 
brazil and argentina this winter which is their summer 
if we get any kind of weather problem down there it will 
restimulate the bullish situation said doug jackson a grain 
analyst with farmers commodities corp in des moines iowa 
analysts were forced to reassess their price forecasts after the 
agriculture department on thursday raised its estimate for the 1990 
us soybean crop by an unprecedented 44 percent to 19 billion 
bushels from its october projection of 182 billion 
it was the biggest octobertonovember increase ever in the 
usdas harvest projections most experts had expected a number near 
184 billion bushels 
the government also raised its estimate of how large the us 
soybean stockpile will be next aug 31 the end of the current 
marketing year to 255 million bushels from 175 million compared 
with 239 million bushels last august 
soybean futures prices plunged friday the day after the report 
soybeans for delivery in november fell 16 cents to 566 a 
bushel 
prior to the report many analysts were expecting soybean prices 
to rise sharply early next year due to relatively tight us 
supplies and prospects for low production in south america where 
economically distressed farmers are expected to plant fewer acres 
than last year 
thursdays crop report indicates us supplies will not be as 
tight as expected 
the situation has gone from one thats slightly constructive 
fundamentally to one thats neutral to bearish said anne frick 
senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in new 
york 
but other analysts said the bigger us harvest estimate will 
encourage south american producers to plant even fewer soybean 
acres which would offset the negative impact on prices the south 
american planting season is under way 
this will lock in the fact that south america will lower 
production said william biedermann research director with 
allendale inc a commodities brokerage in crystal lake ill 
the wild card is export demand which has been extremely weak 
lately but is bound to pick up by early next year as foreign 
consumers seek us supplies 
biedermann said foreign demand will be stimulated by a drop in 
soybean prices in the next few weeks as the market digests the crop 
report 
the lower we go bewteen now and december the more bullish the 
picture gets longterm he said 
victor lespinasse an assistant vice president in the 
graintrading division of dean witter reynolds inc agreed 
i think the lower prices will enhance demand he said i 
think by next summer well be back up again

oil prices fell sharply near the close of 
trading friday on a wild rumor of an iraqi coup 
oil had been moving lower anyway as traders decided they had 
bid prices too high thursday on erroneous speculation that 
president bush was about to announce steps leading to an immediate 
conflict in the persian gulf 
people arent expecting any gunfire until next year now 
said thomas p blakeslee an energy analyst with pegasus 
econometric group inc in hoboken nj 
the coup rumor floated in with about a half hour left to trade 
pushing the already depressed price down another 60 cents 
that probably just fueled things a little bit said trader 
ed kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc 
light sweet crude the benchmark blend of petroleum settled at 
3389 per barrel down 164 for december delivery contracts on 
the new york mercantile exchange contracts for delivery in later 
months all closed more than 1 lower 
for the week crude fell 11 cents a barrel for nextmonth 
delivery 
oil opened lower friday as traders determined they had 
overestimated the impact of a news conference bush had given the 
evening before 
during thursdays session oil shot up as traders speculated 
bushs statement which came after the market closed would contain 
either an ultimatum to iraqi president saddam hussein or a vow to 
airlift supplies to the us embassy in kuwait 
bush instead said he was vastly increasing the us military 
presence in the gulf which traders already had been anticipating 
i think people were expecting some type of ultimatum and what 
they received was the same old thing blakeslee said 
traders in the new york mercantile exchange recently have been 
scared of going through the weekend with speculative positions so 
some of fridays selloff came as they sold oil contracts 
as crude oil fell it dragged down the price of refined products 
traded on the exchange a key market for petroleum 
wholesale home heating oil dropped 406 cents to 9024 cents a 
gallon on december delivery contracts while wholesale unleaded 
gasoline fell 228 cents to 8823 cents a gallon for december 
delivery later contract months were all lower for both products 
for the week heating oil rose 282 cents for nextmonth 
delivery while unleaded gasoline fell 98 cent 
natural gas prices were lower or unchanged friday with december 
delivery contracts falling 6 cent to 2429 per 1000 cubic feet 
for the week nextmonth contracts for natural gas were up 71

soybean futures prices fell to 8month lows friday on the 
chicago board of trade dragging grain futures down as well after 
the government issued a surprisingly large estimate of the newly 
harvested crop 
on other commodity markets oil and precious metal futures fell 
cattle futures rose and pork futures were mixed 
soybean futures settled 5 cents to 17 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in november at 566 a bushel the lowest 
settlement of a nearmonth soybean contract since feb 28 when the 
march contract finished at 566 
wheat futures ended 2 cents to 3 cents lower with december at 
265 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with december at 
231 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with december 
at 117 a bushel 
soybeans were pounded by heavy selling from all sectors after 
the agriculture department on thursday released a monthly crop 
report raising its soybean production estimate 44 percent to 19 
billion bushels from the october estimate of 182 billion the 
market had expected a number near 184 billion 
the report heaped more bearish news on a market that has been 
burdened recently by slack export demand 
with export business not being robust what we need here is 
lower prices to hopefully induce better demand said gerald 
zusel grain analyst with ed amp f man international futures inc 
the government reduced its corn production estimate to 79 
billion bushels from 8 billion which was not enough to offset the 
bearish implications of the soybean number 
oil futures fell sharply on the new york mercantile exchange 
amid profittaking that reflected reduced fears of imminent war in 
the middle east 
president bushs announcement thursday that more us troops 
will be sent to saudi arabia might indicate the usled 
multinational force is preparing to attack iraq troops eventually 
but it quashed expectations for an offensive move in the next few 
days 
the oil market rallied earlier in the week on perceptions that 
the us was preparing for an attack this week 
now it looks like the attack might be put off for a while 
said peter cardillo commodity trading adviser with jesup 
josephthal amp co in new york 
light sweet crude oil futures finished 101 to 164 lower with 
december at 3389 a barrel heating oil was 255 cents to 406 
cents lower with december at 9024 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 151 cents to 238 cents lower with december at 8823 
cents gallon 
gold and silver futures retreated on new yorks commodity 
exchange in reaction to a variety of bearish factors including 
lower oil prices sharply higher stock prices and a government 
report on wholesale prices that indicated inflation outside the 
food and energy categories virtually vanished last month 
platinum futures fell sharply in thin trading on the new york

michael h spindler apple computer 
incs chief operating officer has been named president in a move

role the company said friday 
spindler who helped launch the computermaker on a turnaround 
program will continue to report directly to john sculley apples

at apple since becoming chief operating officer in february 1990 
sculley said 
spindlers new title and sculleys relinquishing of it are 
merely formalities said apple spokeswoman barbara krause 
it really is just a title change at many fortune 100 
companies the coo is also president because it signifies 
leadership of the operational units of the company she said 
apple after several years of fast growth recently suffered a 
sales slowdown and its share of the desktop computer market fell

macintosh line 1799 to 11000 as clones of international 
business machines corp personal computers dominated the low end of 
the market 
but apple has overhauled its strategy hoping to trade high 
profit margins for increased sales it introduced lowcost 
macintoshes last month that start at just under 1000

toys r us which made its name and fortune by 
setting up shop in the burbs has finally moved into the big city 
the worlds largest toy retailer reached a new milestone last 
week with the opening of its first downtown branch in the united 
states a threelevel store in manhattans herald square just 
across from two big competitors macys flagship department store 
and lionel corps kiddie city 
the move represents a big opportunity for toys r us convenience 
for manhattanites who used to travel to suburbia for toys and a 
headache for stores that havent had this kind of competition 
before 
robert nakasone a toys r us vice chairman said the company was 
doing so well in the suburbs it felt for years that it didnt need 
to move into downtown locations 
we said why go ahead and do it he said friday the 
stores second day open 
but eventually toys r us realized manhattan was too lucrative a 
market to keep passing up nakasone said the company decided to 
open a toy store and a companion kids r us clothing store in the 
heart of the city 
the success of kiddie citys herald square store may well have 
been an inducement to toys r us to give manhattan a try 
until a few years ago if you wanted to buy toys in manhattan 
you had few choices there was fao schwarz on fifth avenue for the 
upper crust and department stores and a handful of small 
neighborhood stores for everyone else 
kiddie city was a trailblazer when it opened its herald square 
store several years ago it was a big success and lionel followed 
with two other stores in residential areas of manhattan 
toys r us which has more than 700 stores in the united states 
and overseas has branches in new york citys other four boroughs 
but before last week its only other downtown stores were in 
singapore and germany 
the site chosen by toys r us is the building known as herald 
center on broadway between 33rd and 34th streets it couldnt be 
more high profile it is smack in the middle of manhattans 
biggest shopping area directly across from macys 
the arrival of toys r us provides herald center with a chance at 
revival following a checkered history 
the building began retail life as a saks amp co branch known as 
saks 34th it was a poor cousin to the more famous saks fifth 
avenue 
saks closed the store about 30 years ago and it later became a 
discount retailer korvettes after korvettes folded in the 1970s 
the building became herald center a vertical mall that had few 
stores and few shoppers 
the building later was tied to former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos and his wife imelda it was sold at a 
courtordered auction recently and is being renovated with toys r 
us and kids r us as the malls centerpieces 
for toys r us moving into herald center required a revamping of 
the companys standard onestory configuration shelves had to be 
fit around pillars and columns and elevators and escalators had to 
be installed the total facelift cost more than 1 million 
nakasone said 
the herald square store also is more expensive to run 
with less stockroom space than other toys r us stores it will 
have be resupplied more often that means more trips to the 
companys new jersey warehouse and higher labor and fuel costs 
moving into manhattan also meant toys r us trucks had to be 
adapted to fit into the lincoln tunnel a key thoroughfare that 
connects new york and new jersey 
but to children its like any other toys r us outlet its 
stocked from floor to ceiling with dolls nintendo units and 
cartridges teenage mutant ninja turtles and bicycles 
to competitors toys r us poses a big threat 
macy has long touted itself as the place to go for christmas 
toys but the department store may find itself hardpressed to 
compete with the price and selection that shoppers will find just 
across the street 
kiddie city while carrying many toys also does not have as 
wide a selection as toys r us while toys r us had aisles of 
nintendo equipment and cartridges last week kiddie citys video 
games were tucked into a corner of the store 
fao schwarz could find it has lost some sales to its downtown 
rival because toys r us prices are lower 
for instance a popular baby doll called oopsie daisy so named 
because she falls down and cries costs 66 at fao schwarz and 
40 at toys r us teenage mutant ninja turtles figures that go for 
8 in fao schwarz were selling for 5 at toys r us 
but this doesnt mean a store like fao schwarz should close up 
shop the store appears to be downscaling somewhat it no longer 
features a 15000 junior ferrari in its catalog but still has 
100plus plush animals 300plus dolls and a fifth avenue cachet 
that no other toy store has 
nakasone appeared unconcerned about competition he noted toys r 
us competes with kiddie city in other markets 
he also did not appear worried about the effect that the 
weakened economy and the persian gulf crisis have had on the retail 
business while declining to project what toys r us sales will be 
this year nakasone predicted parents would still spend generously 
on toys 
we expect to have a good christmas he said

friday amid concerns over the us economy and enthusiasm over 
possible weekend tensions in the middle east 
gold prices fell 
with new york currency markets closed on veterans day traders 
stocked up on the us currency in advance of a possible persian 
gulf escalation during the threeday weekend 
the dollar is generally viewed as a relatively safe investment 
in times of strife in addition possible oil shortages resulting 
from a persian gulf strife could hurt japans oildependent economy 
and help diminish the yens value against the dollar traders said 
but before the days end currency trading in new york slowed to 
a virtual crawl as investors eyeing the middle east already had 
covered their shortdollar positions 
analysts said a bigger influence was an earlier labor department 
report that showed the nations core inflation rate the 
producer price index minus food and energy costs remained 
unchanged from september 
investors sold on this sign of moderating inflation seeing it 
as one more reason for the federal reserve to ease interest rates 
to stimulate economic growth lower interest rates can have a 
chilling effect on the value of the dollar 
youre starting to build up a fairly reasonable case for at 
least a quarter of a percent cut said robert hatcher a 
corporate dealer at barclays bank plc 
in new york the dollar dipped to 12970 yen from 13035 yen on 
thursday 
earlier in tokyo the dollar rose 100 yen to a closing 13050

in new york one british pound cost 19655 more expensive than 
thursdays 19625 in london the pound was quoted at 19670 
unchanged from late thursday

dow jones amp co inc said friday it was boosting 
advertising rates for 1991 at the wall street journal the nations 
largest daily newspaper 
at the same time the company confirmed it was closing the 
composing operations at its printing plant in naperville ill and 
transferring the plants responsibilities to a plant in dallas for 
a net reduction of 30 jobs 
the moves come as dow jones begins an austerity program under 
which it has frozen capital spending is trying to hold salary 
spending in 1991 at 1990 levels and is taking other steps to cut 
costs 
two weeks ago dow jones said it was boosting the cover price of 
the journal to 75 cents from 50 cents effective dec 3 and the 
yearly subscription price by 78 percent to 109 
the journal has the largest daily circulation of any us 
newspaper averaging about 185 million in the six months ended 
sept 30 
the companys earnings have fallen this year as the slump on 
wall street and the economy as a whole has shown up in sharply 
reduced advertising spending by financial companies 
the new ad rates which take effect jan 2 1991 include 
increases of 6 percent for national edition advertising and bigger 
increases for regional and overseas editions 
the increase will boost the cost of a fullpage ad in the 
national edition of the journal to 105352 
rates in the eastern midwest western and southwest editions 
will increase 7 percent while regional rates will rise an average 
of 9 percent 
the ad rates will jump 12 percent for the wall street journal 
europe and 10 percent for the asian wall street journal and the 
asian wall street journal weekly 
roger may a spokesman for dow jones said the closing of the 
composing operation at the naperville plant effective in january 
reflects technological improvements that enable the company to cut 
the number of its composing operations to three from four 
nationwide 
he said the closing would mean a cost savings and an improvement 
in operating efficiency but would not adversely affect the quality 
of the newspaper 
he said some of the 40 people employed in the composing 
operation in naperville would be transferred to dallas but that 
the company expected there would be a net reduction of 30 jobs 
in addition to the journal dow jones publishes barrons 
magazine the ottaway group of community newspapers and electronic 
business information services its telerate inc subsidiary

president bush on friday vetoed a bill 
intended to block drug companies from reaping windfall profits 
through monopolistic marketing of drugs that treat rare diseases 
the bill applies to orphan drugs used against diseases that 
affect fewer than 200000 people it was designed to foster more 
competition by eliminating the 7year exclusive marketing rights 
granted under current law to companies that develop such drugs 
bush withheld his signature from the bill and in taking no 
action at a time when congress is not in session killed it through 
what is known as a pocket veto 
i have serious concerns about the effect that the bill would 
have upon the incentive of drug companies to develop orphan 
drugs bush said in a statement 
rep henry waxman dcalif chief sponsor of the bill in the 
house said he was really shocked that bush did not sign the 
bill because the white house had never made a fuss previously 
about the legislation 
the white house contends that taking away the exclusivity 
benefit actually would decrease the willingness of firms to come up 
with orphan drugs because of the expense involved in the research 
and development 
the legislation bush vetoed would have amended the 1983 orphan 
drug act that established the 7year marketing monopoly as an 
incentive for companies to develop drugs that dont promise as 
large a profit as drugs that are used against more widely prevalent 
diseases 
i believe we must not endanger the success of this program 
which is due in large measure to the existence of the market 
exclusivity provision in the orphan drug act bush said 
weakening the current 7year period is the basis of the economic 
incentive to attract drug firms to invest in orphan drugs 
critics however complain the current law has resulted in 
excessively high prices for some drugs including those used to 
treat aids and millions of dollars in profits by the drug firms 
bush also objected to changing the current laws provision that 
allows orphan drug status to diseases that affect more than 200000 
people when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of 
developing the drug will be recovered from sales 
the new legislation would have cut off a drugs orphan drug 
status as soon as the number of people who need the drug exceeded 
200000 
bush said he was extremely concerned that individuals with 
rare disease may suffer because of changes that this bill would 
make in the incentives to develop new drug treatments 
the legislation was supported by aids activists and other 
advocacy groups 
the pharmaceutical manufacturing association opposed the 
legislation but said it was not recommending that bush veto it 
the pma contended the current act was working well to stimulate 
development of drugs that otherwise would not be of interest to 
manufacturers 
only six of the 45 orphan drug approvals since 1983 are for 
populations greater than 50000 many of these drugs would not be 
available without the incentives offered by the orphan drug act 
the organization said in a position paper on the legislation 
there was no immediate comment from the pma on bushs veto said 
spokesman mark grayson 
but waxman alleged some drug companies have gotten to the ear 
of the white house 
waxman said companies dont want to lose the advantage they 
enjoy by being the monopoly supplier of drugs used to treat 
diseases that once were limited to a small population but have 
spread to thousands of people 
he said drugs to treat aids for example should no longer be 
considered orphan drugs 
sen orrin hatch rutah who sponsored the bill in the senate 
was not immediately available for comment 
the food and drug administration has granted socalled orphan 
status to more than 375 drugs more than 40 of which have reached 
the market critics have been concerned that some of these drugs 
were producing monopolistic windfalls for the drug companies that 
marketed them 
some of the diseases that orphan drugs have been developed to 
treat include huntingtons disease tourettes syndrome narcolepsy 
and muscular dystrophy 
on a separate matter bush on friday signed a bill requiring 
food manufacturers to put more nutrition information on the labels 
of food packaging 
the bill also would prohibit manufacturers from making health 
claims on their packaging unless scientifically proven according to 
the food and drug administration 
the legislation mandates that most bulk food in bins raw fish 
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure 
providing nutritional information 
food labels will have to show calories calories from fat fat 
content saturated fat cholesterol sodium total carbohydrates 
complex carbohydrates sugars dietary fiber and protein

the communications ministry said friday it 
selected five finalists for polands first cellular telephone 
contract and defended the bidding process from questions about its 
fairness raised by three us companies 
communications minister jerzy slezak did not name the finalists 
but said he had proof the review was fair and would provide full 
documentation to the companies seeking the contract valued at up 
to 100 million 
according to us ambassador thomas w simons two us 
companies two european consortia and a hong kong company were 
among the final five 
the contract is the first major government project in poland to 
be put to open bid it attracted international telecommunications 
companies and is considered a test of whether the newly capitalist 
economy is ready for sophisticated business dealings with the west 
cellular telephones are viewed as a quick fix for polands 
disastrous telephone system which is impeding business investment 
for the bidders the contract represents an entry point into the 
former east bloc 
the discontent registered by the three american companies was 
underlined by an unusual meeting with journalists held by simons to 
discuss the bidding 
while cautioning that the us government is making no judgment 
about the veracity of the companies concerns he said we 
recognize there are questions about fairness 
communications ministry specialists invited detailed proposals 
from eight of 24 companies that made initial offers in february in 
september three us competitors were eliminated u s west inc of 
englewood colorado ameritech of chicago and millicom inc of new 
york 
from the five finalists including the us companies nynex and 
crowley two will be selected by late december for final 
negotiations simons said 
the three disqualified us companies are seeking 
clarification about why they were eliminated based on a review of 
the technical section of their proposal said james whisenand of 
ameritech 
all the rejected companies are concerned with is that win or 
lose they have the comfort that the process was pristine and 
fair he said 
whisenand would not specify how the companies felt the bidding 
had been compromised but said they seek a reappraisal by the 
ministry 
all three companies would hope that the process will be 
clarified and all eight companies proposals reviewed he said 
the companies contend that their size and experience make clear 
their ability to meet the technical requirements simons said 
slezak said he was astonished by the questions 
i have materials proving the fairness of the process he 
said each of the firms concerned will receive full 
documentation 
the ministry said two of the companies were eliminated because 
they violated an anonymity requirement by disclosing their names in 
the technical portion of their bids

bethlehem steel corp said it would halve 
an 8 percent price increase scheduled for sheet steel shipments 
after dec 29 a move that other major steel makers are expected to 
followed 
bethlehem and the others raised prices in an effort to shore up 
eroding profits said charles bradford an analyst with ubs 
securities in new york 
bethlehem told its customers about the price hike in september 
but customers asked for a reprieve said bethlehem spokesman henry 
h von spreckelsen said thursday 
this action is being taken to better reflect the realities of 
the marketplace spreckelsen said 
but he added at an appropriate time in months ahead 
customers can expect an additional increase to offset rising 
costs 
a spokesman at usx declined to say whether his company the 
nations no 1 steel maker would follow bethlehems lead however 
bradford said usx and other steel makers have little choice 
he said an 8 percent increase was kind of a joke in the first 
place 
i dont think too many companies really expected to get that 
much he said but if you dont ask for more you dont get 
anything 
bradford said steel makers need price relief to cover increased 
costs and wage hikes that go into effect jan 1 
sheet steel is used for autos appliances and construction 
materials bethlehem makes it at its burns harbor ind and 
sparrows point md plants 
the company reported earnings of 533 million for the first 
nine months of 1990 down sharply from 1957 million in the same 
period of 1989 
under the new schedule the price increase on hotrolled steel 
will be lowered to 20 from 35 a ton on coldrolled steel to 25 
from 47 a ton and on galvanized steel to 30 from 49 a ton

government bond prices jumped friday as the 
market anticipated the federal reserve board would lower interest 
rates when it gathers next week traders said 
the price of the governments bellwether 30year bond climbed 
2932 point or about 906 per 1000 in face value its yield 
which falls when the bonds price rises slid to 862 percent from 
870 percent late thursday 
bond prices rose despite a government report showing wholesale 
prices soared 11 percent in october the third consecutive monthly 
advance boosted by rising food and energy prices 
the jump brought producerprice inflation for the first 10 
months of the year to a 7 percent annual rate sharply higher than 
1989s 49 percent rate and the worst since inflation soared at 
doubledigit rates in the early 1980s 
but the bond market took its cue from the socalled core 
inflation rate which doesnt include food and energy prices said 
bob sbarra a senior vice president at the investment firm carroll 
mcentee amp mcginley inc 
minus those factors inflation didnt change from september 
investors believe the feds open market committee will vote at a 
meeting tuesday to lower interest rates to counteract increasing 
signs that the economy is entering a recession traders said the 
flat core inflation rate also gives the fed more latitude to lower 
rates they added 
lower rates benefit fixedreturn securities such as bonds 
some traders are looking for a point reduction in the federal 
funds rate following the feds meeting that is the interest rate

department of corporations the other count alleges they lied to 
the department

turley said that for the first 20 counts prosecutors would 
merely need to be less specific in the charges which allege that 
bonds were sold in ways not approved by the department 
on the other two counts prosecutors were more likely to add 
additional counts to add more detail he said 
keating and the others are accused of misleading investors and 
regulators about the safety of uninsured bonds sold to lincoln 
savings depositors about 250 million worth of junk bonds 
became worthless when lincoln and its parent company collapsed 
many elderly investors lost their life savings 
abbe lowell one of the defense attorneys said he did not think 
prosecutors would have much luck with the amended charges which 
must be filed with the court by nov 19 
let them try as they might they cannot create statutes where 
none exist lowell said 
he said he thought keating had been charged as the result of 
hysteria over the nations savings and loan crisis by wellmeaning 
but mistaken prosecutors 
i think that the district attorney is a little bit confused 
about who the wrongdoers are he said 
ito allowed to stand 20 counts alleging that bonds were sold to 
lincoln savings investors by means of untrue statements or 
omissions of material facts 
ito ordered the attorneys to return on dec 3 for another 
hearing the defense said they would pursue additional motions to 
dismiss the case at that time no matter how many charges are 
allowed to stand then
