hours after soldiers blocked opposition 
deputies from examining ballots in the disputed july 6 elections 
the government party assured the nation monday that a new congress 
will be certified by a sept 1 deadline 
soldiers wearing helmets and carrying automatic rifles stopped 
about 150 opposition representatives late sunday night from 
entering a room at the legislative palace where millions of ballots 
are being held 
the deputieselect said the ballots would prove opposition 
charges that the governing institutional revolutionary party or 
pri rigged the election the army is required to guard the ballots 
until the election is certified 
the air of antagonism at the chamber of deputies now sitting as 
an electoral college raised the question of whether the review 
will be finished in time for the president to swear in a new 
chamber by the constitutional deadline 
the pri holds a slim plurality in the chamber once the chamber 
finishes ratifying 26 disputed congressional races it is supposed 
to move on to the presidential election 
by custom the outgoing chief executive formally introduces his 
successor to the nation on sept 1 during his final 
stateoftheunion address failure to do so would be an 
embarrassing breach of tradition even though the new president is 
not sworn in until dec 1 
missing the deadline could interrupt the constitutional order 
and put the nation on the threshold of a coup detat francisco 
cardenas one of mexicos bestknown political commentators said 
monday in the independent daily el universal 
the confrontation between soldiers and deputies was the latest 
in a series of incidents that marked the review of an election 
which produced unprecedented opposition gains it was frontpage 
news throughout mexico 
before dawn on monday a few hours after the incident the 
leader of the pri delegation guillermo jimenez told reporters 
there will be a chamber on time despite the conflict 
the showdown prompted two prominent roman catholic clergymen to 
issue statements the archbishops of zacatecas javier lozano 
barragan and of chihuahua disan vazquez said they hoped common 
sense would prevail and the electoral college would finish by sept 
1 
the pridominated federal election commission has said the pri 
candidate carlos salinas de gortari won with 5036 percent of the 
vote 
mexican presidents serve single sixyear terms beginning on 
dec 1 the pri has won every presidential election since it was 
created in 1929 
lucia santes a leader of the opposition democratic front 
coalition party in southeastern tabasco state meanwhile said she 
had switched to the pri she said she had been the object of low 
blows envy and rancor and that the pri represents the real 
option for change 
the santes defection was a blow to supporters of cuauhtemoc 
cardenas presidential candidate for the democratic front the 
largest opposition party who ran strongly in tabasco cardenas 
came in second place in presidential voting but maintains that a 
fair count would make him the winner 
late monday cardenas filed criminal charges against manuel 
bartlett diaz president of the federal election commission and 
fernando elias calles the technical secretary accusing them of 
violating the electoral code by not releasing individual results 
from nearly half of the 55000 voting stations nationwide 
bartlett also is interior minister 
we asked that the vote information be made known and that 
the authorities fulfill their responsibility cardenas said 
he brought charges against the two earlier this month but was 
told he needed to file personally with the federal attorney 
generals office

temperatures fell the wind died down and the army arrived 
monday improving conditions for weary firefighters battling forest 
fires that have charred thousands of acres of montana and wyoming 
especially in yellowstone national park 
a first wave of 612 infantrymen from fort lewis wash landed 
at bozeman mont and headed for the 157000acre clover mist fire 
in yellowstones northeastern corner 
soldiers were to help prevent the fire one of 10 burning in the 
park involving about 350000 acres from crossing into montanas 
custer national forest or commercial areas of wyomings shoshone 
national forest 
park spokeswoman joan anzelmo said it was possible some of the

and silvergate to help protect them from the clover mist fire 
burning about 3 miles to the south 
approximately 3000 firefighters were at work in yellowstone 
the nations first national park 
elsewhere reinforcements were called out in idaho to back up

more were expected an order was put in for 280 more people 
wind blew at only 5 to 15 mph monday in yellowstone down from

visitors coming from the south to detour about 150 miles to the 
parks west entrance at west yellowstone mont the northern gate 
and two eastern entries remained open 
other roads closed included the road from the south entrance to 
west thumb junction on the shore of yellowstone lake the road 
from madison junction to norris juction and on to indian creek and 
from norris to canyon junction an eastwest shortcut between the 
western and eastern sides of the main road that circles the park in 
a rough hourglass pattern 
the closings basically cut off the shortest route between the 
west and north entrances and closing the norriscanyon road meant 
the trip from madison junction on the western side of the park to 
the famous fishing bridge in the east went from 39 miles up to 54 
by way of the old faithful geyser the majority of the park 
remained accessible 
in addition the grant village area which contains a hotel 
campground visitor center and park staff dormitories was closed 
as were the norris pebble creek madison and lewis lake 
campgrounds the park contains 12 campgrounds 
south of yellowstone in grand teton national park and the 
bridgerteton national forest the hunter fire that had grown to 
more than 2900 acres in one day had calmed monday said don 
bright fire information officer 
in addition firefighters completed bulldozer lines around the 
southwest and northwest flanks of the hunter blaze and officials 
allowed residents evacuated saturday to return to their homes as 
well as guests of the teton science school and lost creek ranch 
bright said 
meanwhile a preliminary investigation concluded that a 
helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in the bighorn national 
forest crashed after it lost power to its rear rotor which 
stabilizes the craft investigators are unsure why the rotor lost 
power fire information officer harvalou buchanan said 
last fridays crash killed merrin rodgers 51 a bureau of land 
management communications technician and injured the pilot and two 
other passengers 
officials in montana took advantage of the calmer cooler 
weather to have crews dig a fire line by hand in rugged terrain 
along the southern edge of the 13dayold warm springs creek fire 
southeast of helena 
theyll be right at the burning edge fire information 
officer bob krepps said monday he said the 37200acre fire was 
only smoldering there monday allowing crews to go in with less 
risk

elsewhere in montana 20 smokejumpers parachuted into the storm 
creek fire that has burned 22000 acres of the absarokabeartooth 
wilderness and 80 more were to be taken in by fourwheel drive 
vehicles said beartooth district ranger phil jaquith the fire 
raced eight miles in a matter of hours saturday kicked up by high 
wind he said 
the hellroaring creek fire in a different section of the same 
giant wilderness area northeast of yellowstone national park had 
covered an estimated 24400 acres by monday spokeswoman maggie 
pittman said about 360 firefighters were working on the blaze

in southeastern montana officials called for reinforcements to 
help battle a blaze out of control south of the northern cheyenne 
indian reservation don kendall of the department of state lands

a british newspaper said tuesday up to 710 soviet 
soldiers and civilians were killed in a rocket attack by afghan 
rebels on a military base north of kabul the capital of 
afghanistan 
the daily telegraph said its account of the rocket assault that 
occurred either aug 10 or 11 was based on reports received in 
peshawar pakistan from afghan guerrillas 
earlier reports had surfaced from diplomatic and guerrilla 
sources of the attack on the kalagay military base 100 miles north 
of kabul but they had few details and a lower death toll 
daily telegraph correspondent james bone in peshawar reported a 
spokesman for a guerrilla group said the rockets devastated the 
kalagay ammunition depot and turned the soviet compound into an 
inferno 
bone quoted the spokesman who was not identified as saying 
maybe it was lucky but it was a good hit and our greatest day 
western diplomatic sources in islamabad had said at least 109 
soviet soldiers died at kalagay 
bone said the casualties were much higher according to a report 
written on cloth by muhibullah khan a guerrilla commander in the 
kalagay district and received in peshawar 
bone said muhibullah khans report quoted a leader of the 
government militia as saying 598 soviet soldiers and 112 soviet 
civilians were killed and 284 soviets were wounded he wrote that 
the report said the guerrillas fired eight 107mm rockets into the 
supply base 
western reporters generally are barred from afghanistan and 
there was no independent confirmation of conflicting claims by the 
government and guerrillas 
if the report attributed to muhibullah khan was accurate it 
would be possibly the worst single loss by soviet forces since they 
entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the marxist government 
battle the rebels 
under an accord signed by afghanistan and pakistan with soviet 
participation last april all soviet military personnesl are to be 
withdrawn from afghanistan by feb 15 the soviet union had up to 
115000 troopers in the country but announced that half of the 
force had been removed as of aug 15 according to the withdrawal 
schedule 
the anticommunist guerrillas did not participate in the peace 
negotiations and have vowed to continue their fight

hurricane forecasters monday were tracking three 
tropical depressions the closest one expected to gradually 
strengthen as it moves into the western caribbean 
the newest tropical depression formed monday in the middle 
atlantic ocean east of the lesser antilles the westwardmoving 
systems highest sustained winds were near 35 mph around a center 
roughly 325 miles east of the island of guadeloupe the national 
hurricane center in suburban coral gables reported at 1030 pm 
monday the depression was moving about 20 to 25 mph 
an air force reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to 
investigate the depression tuesday morning 
forecasters were most concerned with the caribbean depression 
which was moving westnorthwest at about at about 15 to 20 mph and 
had highest sustained winds of near 35 mph the hurricane center 
said the poorly organized depression was about 175 miles southeast 
of kingston jamaica 
the one in the caribbean probably has the best potential 
said forecaster bob case once it moves into the western 
caribbean it seems more favorable for development 
some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours case 
said monday 
any time theres a tropical depression southeast of us at this 
time of year you need to pay attention case added 
of the tropical activity case said it was quite normal at 
this point in the hurricane season which began june 1 and ends 
nov 30 
were really approaching the peak of the season he said 
little strengthening was expected in the newly formed depression 
unless it slowed its forward speed case said 
meanwhile the most distant system located about 200 miles 
northwest of santo antao in the cape verde islands off west africa 
was moving northwest at 15 to 20 mph into colder water and little 
change in strength was expected until a gradual decrease late 
tuesday its highest sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph 
depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their 
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74 
mph there have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988 
atlantic ocean hurricane season but neither reached hurricane 
strength

sen dan quayle told a veterans group monday 
absolutely no influence was used to get him into the indiana 
national guard during the height of the vietnam war 
in brief remarks to a convention of the veterans of foreign wars 
in chicago the republican vice presidential nominee influence 
was not even necessary if i had chosen to use it which i never 
would have 
the reason is because my indiana national guard unit had 
openings before i applied they had openings when i applied and 
they had openings after i applied so there was absolutedly no 
influence used 
the crowd of about 2500 veterans cheered and whistled turing 
the hastily called appearance in which the indiana senator joked 
my national guard unit was never called up to active duty but 
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say ive never 
faced combat 
presidential nominee george bush and his aides have sought to 
play down suggestions that quayles candidacy needed shoring up 
after a rocky week dominated by the controversy over whether 
quayle a promilitary conservative on capitol hill pulled strings 
to enter the national guard in 1969 as his college draft deferment 
was about to end 
in a report in tuesdays editions of the washington post the 
guard official who swore in quayle said he received no special 
treatment retired major general alfred f ahner said in a 
telephone interview that there had to have been a vacancy before 
he enlisted 
the cleveland plain dealer reported however that records 
show the guard under a virtual freeze on recruitment imposed 49 
days before quayles enlistment on may 19 1969 
the documents also appear to contradict assertions from some 
former indiana guard officers that the guard had more than 200 
vacancies and therefore was open to quayle without special 
treatment or favoritism the story said 
at the vfw conference where bush had appeared earlier monday 
quayle also said he hoped to put the issue of his military record 
behind him so attention could be focused on the real issues of 
the campaign 
the question before all of us is not what dan quayle did 20 
years in the past but what either president bush or president 
dukakis will do in the future to secure world peace quayle said 
the circumstances surrounding quayles unplanned lastminute 
appearance before the veterans group were in dispute wade ladue 
the spokesman for the organization said quayle was invited monday 
after illinois gov james thompson intervened with commander in 
chief earl stock 
thompson is a key bush supporter in illinois quayle press 
secretary david prosperi said stock made the invitation kevin 
morris communications director for the bush campaign in illinois 
said members of the vfw encouraged thompson to persuade quayle to 
appear 
quayle flew back to the nations capital sunday accompanied by 
james a baker iii bushs campaign chairman and top strategist to 
meet with the new campaign staff assembled for him by bush aides 
bush departed from his prepared remarks to a veterans of foreign 
wars convention in chicago on monday to defend his running mate 
dan quayle served in the national guard signing up in a unit 
that had vacancies at the time and now he is under shrill partisan 
attack bush said his voice rising so let his attackers cast 
the first stone he served honorably true he didnt go to 
vietnam but his unit wasnt sent 
but theres another truth he did not go to canada he did 
not burn his draft card and he damned sure didnt burn the american 
flag bush said drawing cheers and a standing ovation from the 
veterans 
quayle is scheduled to return to the campaign trail wednesday 
certain to face more questions about the guard issue and how he got 
into law school when he did not meet admission requirements 
he is to attend legislative conferences in cincinnati and 
lexington ky before traveling to st louis where aides say he 
will deliver a major address to the enlisted association of the 
national guard composed of current and former enlisted personnel 
meanwhile newsweek magazine reported that during his 1980 
senate campaign quayle referred to himself in political pamphlets 
as a vietnamera veteran quayle dropped the reference after 
objections by some vietnam combat veterans although the reference 
was technically correct newsweek said that his national guard duty 
was not the type of service implied in the leaflet 
in the interview quayle also said his influential family didnt 
pull strings to get him admitted to indiana university law school 
the staff that the bush campaign has assembled for quayle is a 
group with substantial experience in the white house and 
presidential politics 
stuart spencer a longtime reagan adviser and member of the 
presidents kitchen cabinet is chairing quayles campaign his 
deputy is joseph canzeri known as an expert detail man during his 
years in the reagan white house 
spencer long a reagan intimate is a savvy strategist who has 
been at reagans side in most of his political decisions 
canzeri served nelson rockefeller titan of the republican 
partys moderate wing for nearly 20 years a presidential 
assistant and deputy to reagan aide michael deaver canzeri was 
known as a mr fixit in the white house for his quick humor and 
ability to get things done 
canzeri resigned in 1982 under a cloud after accepting mortgages 
from friends at favorable interest rates and doublebilling the 
white house and the republican national committee for 700 and 
change for two dinners he gave while out of the country preparing 
for presidential trips the justice department later concluded that 
canzeri did not violate federal law 
quayles press secretary prosperi was interior secretary 
donald hodels spokesman and also worked at the reagan white house

actress valerie harper denied from the 
witness stand monday that she demanded absolute control over the tv 
series she was fired from declaring i wasnt trying to be 
genghis khan 
i wanted to have participation early knowledge of stories so 
i would be in a partnership on the show she said of her 
situation comedy series valerie 
ms harper was called to the stand by attorneys for lorimar the 
production company suing her for alleged breach of contract she is 
countersuing the company contending it wrongfully fired her from 
the show 
attorney donald engel sought to show that ms harper was aware 
of all aspects of her 1985 contract with lorimar and tried to 
renegotiate it because she craved more money and total control over 
all aspects of the show 
ms harper denied this saying that she left business matters in 
the hands of her husband tony cacciotti and left the contract to 
her agent and lawyer whose advice she later came to doubt 
im not good with contracts she said holding the lorimar 
document i read these and start to get crosseyed 
ms harper acknowledged that even before the pilot for 
valerie was sold her relations with other members of the 
production staff began to erode 
the first problem she said arose when cacciottis name was 
left off the list of credits on the pilot for valerie even 
though he had acted as supervising producer 
i was disappointed and hurt she said it felt like a 
betrayal 
she told jurors that she and cacciotti have been business 
partners since 1979 and have been married just over a year 
engel enumerated the financial terms of the contract that 
brought ms harper 15 million for the first oneandahalf 
seasons on the air and provided profit shares and escalating 
salaries for her and her husband in subsequent years in the sixth 
season she would have received 90000 per episode 
didnt you realize that you had a very favorable deal asked 
engel 
i felt financially it was a start ms harper replied 
she faulted herself for letting too many unwritten agreements 
stay out of the contract 
there was a rush to sign the contract and they said well 
work out the details later she said 
ms harper said she sought to renegotiate her contract later to 
increase her salary and put in writing her creative participation 
in story ideas for each episode 
by then she conceded she felt she was losing the right to 
affect story lines 
the consultation i had enjoyed had eroded and the relationship 
with the producers had started to turn she said 
what you thought you had was total control said engel 
i would disagree said ms harper i wanted participation 
not controli wasnt trying to be genghis khan i wanted 
participation with people i loved and respected 
lorimar fired ms harper from the show a year ago and replaced 
her with sandy duncan the show is now known as the hogan 
family 
ms harpers testimony came on her 48th birthday but the event 
was not mentioned in the courtroom

the basement warren called the hole where fire 
claimed seven lives is one of hundreds of illegal social clubs 
dotting the citys poorer neighborhoods that continue to operate 
despite repeated police raids 
more than 30 people were injured in the fire at the bronx club 
sunday afternoon as 60 to 100 panicked patrons tried to escape 
through the lone exit 
despite periodic campaigns to close them down social clubs a 
local term everyone admits is misleading have been centers of 
urban problems ranging from noise and doubleparking to gambling 
prostitution and drug dealing 
police had raided the hole five times since march to try to shut 
it down 
rife with building health and fire code violations the clubs 
repeatedly have been the scene of serious fires including one in 
brooklyn three years ago that killed five people 
such clubs are common in large cities in 1967 a police raid on 
an illegal club in detroit blind pig was the local term 
sparked days of rioting 
in new york city alcohol is sold without a license at more than 
200 locations according to estimates by police precinct 
commanders clubs have operated in the past at another 400 
locations and could reopen any time 
some were closed under the citys padlock law which allows 
police to shutter a location for a year if two crimes are committed 
on the site within a 12month period 
but police have been unable to close many other clubs the hole 
first raided in may 1984 is a prime example 
police hit the club five times between march 22 and july 26 
seizing cash and liquor and arresting a total of nine people most 
of them employees charged with selling liquor without a state 
license but the club never stayed closed because the police 
couldnt get even the two criminal convictions needed under the 
padlock law 
when the fire broke out sunday most of the cases were still 
plodding through the citys overloaded court system in the three 
that were resolved defendants were allowed to plead guilty to 
disorderly conduct and pay fines of between 50 and 100 
that is useless to us said deputy inspector frank biehler 
because disorderly conduct does not qualify as a criminal 
conviction under the padlock law 
the fines were particularly puny compared to those prescribed 
for violations of the liquor law about 10000 each 
despite the label places like the hole are neither social nor 
clubs 
the consumption of alcohol is often of secondary importance 
a state task force report said the primary function of these 
operations has developed into prostitution gambling drugs and 
trafficking in stolen property 
city police have made 1128 arrests at clubs in the past 12 
months 
new york state liquor licenses cost up to 5100 and are good 
for three years but many people do not apply for one often 
because they have a criminal record or plan to employ others who do 
also if a bar is not licensed it doesnt have to worry about 
state inspectors coming in and seeing things they dont want 
seen said richard chernela spokesman for the state liquor 
authority 
just about anyone can go to a social club despite the terms 
implication of exclusivity an employee usually keeps an eye on the 
door but a club member is generally anyone who walks in on a given 
night 
or morning while the citys licensed bars are required to close 
by 4 am social clubs often are open until dawn or later usually 
to the distress of neighborhood residents 
when the police do stage a raid securing evidence is 
problematic when we come in a lot of things hit the floor and 
go down the toilet biehler said 
owners are rarely convicted when you arrest a bartender you 
havent arrested the guy whos really calling the shots and so the 
place is back in business with a new bartender the next day 
chernela said 
after a tragedy like this everyone looks at the government 
but its a very difficult problem said chernela you close 
them and they just spring back up

sanford c sigoloff the corporate 
white knight who rescued wickes cos inc from bankruptcy five 
years ago on sunday announced a managementled leveraged buyout 
offer of 12 a share 
the retail giant including the builders emporium and wickes 
furniture stores also announced a net loss of 124 million for 
the second quarter ended july 30 said company spokesman michael 
sitrick 
sigoloff disclosed that wii holdings corp a firm he 
established with members of his wickes management team will offer 
to purchase nearly 40 million shares of outstanding common stock 
sitrick said he said wii stands for w2 or wickes 2 
the offer is nearly 3 higher than wickes closing stock price 
of 9 on the new york stock exchange last friday 
while i have strong confidence in the longterm viability and 
prospects of our continuing businesses sigoloff said in a 
prepared statement it has become increasingly clear to me as 
well as the other directors of the company that our stockholders 
want to maximize the value of their investment in the company in 
the immediate nearterm 
the 39846600 shares sought in the merger deal represent about 
83 percent of wickes outstanding shares sitrick said 
the offer is scheduled to be in effect from aug 26 to oct 20 
he said 
it is expected that the principal investors in wii holdings will 
be institutional investors including drexel burnham lambert inc 
which promised no problems in arranging financing for the buyout 
sitrick said 
the offer is void if fewer than 50 percent of outstanding shares 
are sold he said 
the companys net loss for the second quarter amounted to 28 
cents a share with reported earnings of 104 million or 19 cents 
a share on sales of 9379 million and losses from discontinued 
operation of 228 million or 47 cents a share 
in april 1982 wickes with assets estimated at about 3 
billion became the largest us company to file for bankruptcy 
protection but less than two years later creditors approved a 
plan allowing wickes to emerge from chapter 11 proceedings 
analysts had predicted it would take wickes at least five years 
to erase the accumulated red ink 
the force behind the comeback was sigoloff who earned the 
nickname ming the merciless for the toughminded business moves 
and hardnosed cost cutting he employed to resuscitate two other 
los angeles companies in the 1970s republic corp and daylin inc 
sigoloff reorganized wickes by selling off seasonal divisions 
such as macgregor golf and wickes agriculture at the same time he 
revamped store displays and appeared in television commercials and 
offered his personal guarantee of renewed product quality and 
service

britain is booming as an arms dealer supplanting 
the united states as wealthy saudi arabias biggest supplier and 
edging out longtime rival france globally as purveyor of 
everything from bullets to jet fighters 
less particular than the united states about who buys its 
increasingly sophisticated wares britain has doubled its sales in 
the past three years through a mixture of politics hardsell and 
technical advances 
the most glittering prize is a 17 billion deal clinched last 
month with saudi arabia that includes 50 tornado fighterbombers 
it underlines britains major advantage over the united states 
there are no political constraints on british arms sales to 
israels arab enemies 
the number of restrictions the united states has on sales is 
preposterous says francis tusa analyst at the londonbased 
royal united services institute for defense studies 
the saudis have made it clear that they are not going to be 
told any longer by the us congress you can have what you want 
but only a third of it and not for another five years and providing 
you dont base it where you want to he said in an interview 
with the ink just dry on the saudi deal defense secretary 
george younger was back in the middle east this time in kuwait 
talking arms about the same time the us senate blocked the sale 
of maverick airtosurface missiles that were to accompany 40 
american f18 fighters kuwait had agreed to buy throwing doubt on 
the near 2 billion deal 
our friends and friendly rivals have their problems 
acknowledged an official of the defense ministrys defense exports 
services organization requesting anonymity 
with a staff of 250 the organizations main job is to oil the 
wheels of sales drives by privately owned british armament 
manufacturers such as the airplane giant british aerospace and 
also check that they dont sell to banned countries 
these include south africa syria libya and israel which is 
officially under a british arms embargo since the 1982 invasion of 
lebanon 
according to defense ministry figures between 1985 and 1987 
britain doubled to 12 percent its share of the world arms market 
outside the east bloc 
britain the defense ministry says is now the worlds third 
largest arms supplier ranking well behind the united states 
washington probably gives away more than we sell worldwide 
said one official and the soviet union but pushing france down 
to fourth place 
britain signed defense contracts worth 4 billion in 1985 in 
1986 the figure was nearly 9 billion with a first major saudi 
contract to buy tornado planes and last year contracts totaled an 
estimated 56 billion 
defense export services organization chief sir colin chandler 
who received a knighthood this year on prime minister margaret 
thatchers recommendation says britains 1987 figure keeps it 
ahead of france 
in 1986 with the saudi deal britain moved temporarily into 
second place ahead of the soviet union 
mrs thatcher has assiduously cultivated the oilrich saudis on 
official visits and rolled out the red carpet for king fahd in 
london 
she slips in plugs for british armaments during foreign trips 
including recently in canada where britain and france are 
competing for a multimilliondollar order for nuclearpowered 
submarines 
british officials arms manufacturers and some analysts say 
prime factors in the increased sales are improved weapons and 
warplanes including the multinational tornado developed with west 
germany and italy and the freeenterprise atmosphere generated by 
nearly a decade of thatcher government 
it is a fact that were producing more things with fewer 
people said a british official adding the 130000strong 
workforce in the defense industry has declined slightly in the past 
few years he requested anonymity 
others familiar with the secretive world of arms sales say 
france has also been hurt by a tradition of gearing arms exports to 
third world countries on generous credit terms 
philip parker marketing director for plessey one of five 
british defense electronics manufacturers said that with britain 
cutting defense spending companies are forced to expand foreign 
sales 
we have to go and slug it out in the market place in the major 
countries said parker in an interview 
plessey says its annual turnover from defense sales has more 
than trebled to 850 million since 1980 with sonar systems going 
to the swedish thai and south korean navies an 850 million 
communications network for the australian army and smaller deals 
with oman new zealand greece and an unidentified far eastern 
country 
but british manufacturers have suffered some big failures too 
the most expensive was the scrapping of the nimrod spy plane in 
1986 after nine years work by britains general electric company 
costing nearly 17 billion britain ordered the us boeing 
airborne warning and command system instead

soldiers manned barricades in burmas 
capital monday and most shops were closed as merchants heeded 
student calls for a nationwide strike to demand a return to 
democracy kyodo news service said 
the general strike was expected to be a test for president maung 
maung who came to power friday and is burmas first civilian 
leader in the 26 years since a military coup replaced democracy 
with oneparty rule 
a messenger representing student groups defying an 8 pm to 4 
am curfew ran through residential areas of rangoon to rally 
support for the strike the japanese news agency reported from the 
burmese capital 
soldiers stood at major points in the center of rangoon where 
barbed wire barricades had been erected to guard against 
demonstrators kyodo said adding that people were seen cutting 
palm trees on the roads to set up barricades against the military 
the report quoted unidentified sources as saying a large number 
of demonstrators rode trucks into the capital on sunday night 
an asian diplomat in rangoon said the city was relatively 
quiet monday morning 
for the sixth straight day sunday authorities released people 
arrested in rangoon during aug 812 riots that prompted the 
resignation of maung maungs predecessor sein lwin after only 17 
days in power troops fired into crowds of demonstrators in the 
riots and the government said 112 people were killed 
official radio rangoon said 100 people were freed sunday 
bringing the total reported released in rangoon to 408 thousands 
of people are still believed detained 
on saturday people demonstrated peacefully in mandalay burmas 
secondlargest city and in five other towns according to radio 
rangoon 
the staterun newspaper working peoples daily reported saturday 
that during the aug 812 protests hysterical mobs decapitated at 
least five people including three police officers in the rangoon 
suburb of north okkalapa 
two of the policemens heads were stuck on bamboo poles and 
one was put on a stool for all to see according to the 
newspaper obtained sunday from a western embassy in bangkok the 
report said the protesters then burned the bodies 
one of the victims was a civilian mistaken for an intelligence 
agent and beheaded after a mob stoned him to death it said 
the leader of the demonstration in north okkalapa township 
wore a hood to hide his face as he screamed at the top of his voice 
for the emergence of the aung gyi government the newspaper 
said 
aung gyi the countrys leading dissident was arrested with 
several other prominent figures july 2930 among those seized was 
sein win the burma correspondent of the associated press 
the wave of turmoil in burma began july 27 when leader ne win 
resigned and sein lwin came to power a retired army general sein 
lwin was widely hated for ruthlessly suppressing dissent and 
disturbances began almost immediately 
at first peaceful the demonstrations became violent on aug 8 
and security personnel fired shots to disperse the crowds some 
protesters fought back and the government said 112 people were 
killed and 267 wounded in rangoon diplomats there believe hundreds 
may have been killed 
the violence continued until aug 12 when sein lwin resigned 
but smaller studentled protests continued almost daily to press 
for an end to oneparty rule and for economic reforms 
the asian diplomat said the government was unlikely to agree to 
multiparty democracy after a quartercentury of ironfisted 
control by the burma socialist program party founded by gen ne 
win the general led the march 2 1962 coup that toppled the 
elected government of prime minister u nu 
burmese media also have rejected the idea of returning to a 
multiparty system noting in recent days that the government 
during burmas 14 years of democracy was corrupt and inefficient 
but officials have said in recent days that the current government 
also is corrupt 
a western diplomat who asked for anonymity said saturday that 
maung maung has remained silent on the issue the president did not 
flatly reject democracy in his speech friday before the emergency 
party session that elected him

author william styron expressed 
ambivalence about adding the prestigious edward macdowell medal to 
a room already bulging with trophies honorary cups and plaques 
i am a gemini with a bifurcated ego styron author of 
sophies choice and the confessions of nat turner said 
sunday at the macdowell colony for artists one branch 
delights in being stroked while the other emits howls 
joining the ranks of 28 previous medalists including leonard 
bernstein georgia okeeffe alexander calder and john updike 
styron questioned whether awards and medals might actually hinder 
an artists progress 
its hard to believe that medals and honors might have 
improved the quality of the work of our literary ancestors 
styron said noting that edgar allan poe nathaniel hawthorne 
emily dickinson and walt whitman never received awards 
the immense and fomented loneliness of the writers of that 
time makes it plausible to think they might have been violated 
perhaps irreparably had that loneliness been intruded upon by 
anxiety over winning a prize he said

supermarket checker vicki mcclure says shes 
glad her moment in the spotlight as solo singer at the opening of 
the 1984 olympic summer games didnt catapult her to instant 
success 
im not disappointed for what has happened because being 
thrust in at that level with my inexperience would have been a 
mistake mcclure said 
i really wouldnt have had an inkling of how to handle it 
still she has fond memories of the grand event four years ago 
it was the most spectacular moment it was bigger than life 
she said recently it was a really magical experience 
ms mcclure sang the hit reach out and touch somebodys 
hand at the opening ceremonies of the 1984 olympics at los 
angeles memorial coliseum 
the 7 million opening ceremony had a cast of thousands and was 
staged before a capacity crowd of 90000 and an international 
television audience 
the show included a 1000voice choir a 750piece marching 
band a 100piece symphony orchestra 7500 athletes and 2500 
pigeons 
ms mcclure who was 30 at the time appeared as the lead singer 
in the los angeles jazz choir a position originally intended for a 
star of the caliber of diana ross 
but after olympics officials heard her sing they chose her to 
perform because they liked the idea of having an unknown singer 
it was kind of in keeping with the amateur spirit of the 
olympics she said 
ms mcclure said she is happy working as a professional singer 
performing at banquets and ceremonies and with the group daddys 
money which performs nostalgic and rhythm and blues songs 
i havent really done a vicki mcclure act as of yet she 
said im still looking for a repertoire its hard to find 
material youre comfortable with by yourself

us military personnel are reporting 
increased harassment by local officials but there is no indication 
the actions are part of a new campaign by the government of gen 
manuel antonio noriega us authorities said sunday 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy said the 
incidents involved harassment not attacks 
noriega is commander of panamas defense forces and controls the 
civilian government he was indicted in february by two grand 
juries in florida on drug trafficking charges and the united states 
has imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force him to resign 
and leave panama 
a statement by the defense forces late sunday called the 
accusations of harassment part of a campaign of disinformation in 
an effort to destabilize panama and listed numerous allegations of 
misconduct by us forces in panama 
ms farrell said the reports of harassment are coming only from 
us military personnel 
civilians business people and embassy personnel have reported 
no increase in harassment she said she added she did not know 
if us military personnel are being bothered more or are simply 
reporting more cases 
an official at the us southern command in panama who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said 240 cases of harassment had been 
reported between february and august of this year 
he said incidents of harassment have increased in number and 
gravity but denied reports the incidents were being considered 
attacks 
whats going on these days has been going on for months 
going way back to last year the official said if there was an 
increase it probably came in january february march and april 
not in the last month or two 
one of the things thats happening is that a lot of people are 
being asked for bribes when theyre stopped for traffic violations 
and thats probably because the police arent getting paid 
regularly the official said 
panamas economy has been damaged by the us sanctions 
the southern command official said a more serious incident 
occurred last week when panamanian defense forces officers refused 
to let us military vehicles pick up mail for three days at panama 
citys international airport the dispute was resolved after three 
days the official said but he did not elaborate 
the new york times on sunday quoted us southern command state 
and defense department officials as saying there have been an 
increasing number of beatings abductions rape and extortion of 
us military personnel and their dependents in panama 
the story under a washington dateline said the us officials 
view the incidents as a campaign by noriega to pressure the united 
states to lift economic sanctions against panama 
the defense forces statement said the supposed us 
government officials cited by the times must have the iq of a 
3yearold cromagnon when they assert that actions taken by the 
panama defense forces against us military personnel are attempts 
to force the reagan administration to lift or soften economic 
sanctions imposed on panama 
the statement said us troops cause daily problems for 
panamanian authorities including fights mistreatment of women 
venereal disease shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar 
and restaurant tabs 
washington imposed economic sanctions on panama in march after 
the noriega ousted president eric arturo delvalle 
delvalle has since been in hiding but the united states 
continues to recognize him as panamas legitimate president 
about 12000 us servicemen are stationed in panama by treaty 
to protect the panama canal a vital waterway linking the atlantic 
and pacific oceans they are attached to the southern command 
which is in charge of all us military operations south of the 
usmexico border 
the first southern command official reached by the associated 
press acknowledged several specific incidents reported by the 
times including a case in june in which an enlisted man and his 
wife were assaulted at gunpoint by a man described as a panamanian 
military officer 
the assailant forced the enlisted man into the trunk of his car 
then beat and raped his wife 
the individual was dressed in a camouflaged uniform but he 
could have been military paramilitary a civilian guard or just 
some guy who knows somebody in the pdf panamanian defense forces 
and somehow managed to get himself a uniform said the southern 
command official as far as i know we dont have a definite 
description or identification

a house panel says the veterans administration 
made numerous errors as it hurriedly processed disability claims 
but had time to give special treatment to applicants who had the 
ear of influential lawmakers 
a house government operations committee report released sunday 
described two separate systems for handling claims 
applicants without pull had their cases rushed to judgment 
by errorprone managers trying to win pay bonuses for meeting 
production quotas the report said 
but the panel said the bureau of veterans appeals the court of 
last resort for claimants whose benefits were denied maintained 
a list of congressmen who should be brought to the bva chairmans 
attention if they inquire about an appeal 
at a hearing last february by the panels subcommittee on human 
resources a former appeals board member daniel jb bierman was 
asked whether there was preferential treatment when a lawmaker on 
the list intervened 
bierman replied it is difficult for me to say but i suspect 
that to be the case sir otherwise there would be no reason for 
it the list 
the bva showed favoritism to claimants who had the ear of 
certain influential members of congress the committee concluded 
the va said in a statement it has not been provided with a 
copy of the committees report and is obviously disadvantaged by 
the fact that it was released to the media before it came to us we 
intend to review it thoroughly when it is received 
va officials refused to reply to the panels specific 
allegations 
addressing the appeals boards quota system the report said 
the board of veterans appeals was so caught up in an 
unreasonable production quota standard that some members were 
deciding cases at the rate of one every eight minutes 
the committee noted that earlier this year the va ended 
productionbased bonuses and preferential treatment after both 
practices were publicized in subcommittee hearings and challenged 
in a lawsuit filed by vietnam veterans of america 
the report suggested that congress end a 55yearold prohibition 
and allow veterans who are denied benefits to appeal their cases in 
federal court in 1987 veterans won less than 13 percent of the 
time under the nowabolished quota system at the va appeals board 
the committee said the va tried to cover up its frequent 
mistakes in disability claims by deliberately underreporting the 
error rate to staffers for the human resources subcommittee headed 
by rep ted weiss dny 
the va approves about 11 billion in disability benefits 
annually to 25 million veterans widows and children while some 
veterans were improperly denied benefits under the vas 
errorplagued system others may have received money to which they 
were not entitled according to committee staffers 
nine of the 15 republicans on the 38member committee filed 
dissenting views disagreeing with the recommendation for court 
appeals 
while we share the committees concerns about practices 
such as production quotas we cannot support the committees 
inference that the appeals board does not have the best interests 
of the veterans in mind they said 
the report did not give exact numbers of errors but cited a 
1984 internal study of 1700 cases by va lawyer ronald b abrams 
he found 
a substantive error rate of 84 percent that led to denial 
of claims that should have been approved this category refers to 
mathematical and other factual errors 
an 182 percent judgmental error rate in which the wrong 
decision was made even though the data used to render the opinion 
were accurate 
a procedural error rate of 215 percent in cases where the 
mistake did not affect the final benefit determination 
the va however gave the subcommittee lower error rates for the 
198387 period substantive errors 102 percent to 173 percent 
judgmental errors 111 percent to 181 percent and procedural 
discrepancies 391 percent to 509 percent 
the vas quota system was described to the subcommittee earlier 
this year by ernest b wright a member of the board of veterans 
appeals and bierman 
they testified that bva members had production quotas of 
40 cases per week which if fulfilled could result in merit pay 
increases as high as 5 percent of a members pay the report said

its 8 oclock at night and tiffany gardner 
is lying on a couch a pillow over her head to block the light and 
a telephone pressed to her ear 
its a common scene for a 17yearold whiling away a summer 
before senior year in high school 
but tiffany is at work and she is speaking to a stranger an 
unmarried 19yearold girl who recently had a baby 
her parents ignored her pregnancy and her boyfriend is away in 
the military said the volunteer listener at teen line a 
teentoteen hotline 
she was just really depressed tiffany said she wasnt 
looking for advice just someone to listen 
in the seven years since teen line began more than 50000 calls 
have come in to people like tiffany who was on duty during a 
recent night with three other teen listeners and an adult health 
care professional 
the listeners work out of cedarssinai medical center in an 
office where nearly every inch of wall space is covered with 
referral numbers to hundreds of service organizations such as 
planned parenthood suicide prevention the department of child 
services and aids information centers 
when teens are in need no matter what their socioeconomic 
status they contact their peers said psychiatrist dr terry d 
lipton president of the center for the study of young people in 
groups and cofounder of teen line 
they wont talk to school counselors psychiatrists or 
priests but what they will do is pick up the phone and call a 
friend 
teen line is staffed nightly from 6 pm to 10 pm offhour 
callers can leave a message and their call will be returned by a 
teen listener 
lipton and elaine leader a senior staff member at cedarsinais 
department of psychiatry and program coordinator of teen line say 
it is one of the most costefficient ways to provide mental health 
services to adolescents 
most callers are between ages 1319 although parents sometimes 
phone to get a teenagers perspective on problems their children 
are experiencing ms leader said 
most calls deal with boyfriendgirlfriend problems but the 
listeners often hear from pregnant teens those seeking sexual 
advice and childabuse victims 
from 3 percent to 4 percent of the teen line calls are suicidal 
ms leader said 
the volunteer listeners are carefully screened before being 
accepted then must train 12 weeks before answering a hotline phone 
the training focuses on developing rapport crisis intervention 
addictive behaviors all aspects of sexuality family problems and 
more the volunteers must attend either a recovery program meeting 
such as alcoholics anonymous or overeaters anonymous participate 
in a teen line outreach program in los angeles high schools attend 
monthly staff meetings and commit one night per week to the hotline 
lipton ms leader and other adult specialists unaffiliated with 
the program have few reservations about allowing teenagers to take 
on the responsibility of suicide calls 
these young people are in that position anyway lipton said 
on a daily basis they are in school with kids and peers who 
constantly give clues about their own despair 
the listeners establish if the caller is suicidal through a 
series of questions 
well ask them have you ever tried it before how did you do 
it what kinds of pills were they do you have them with you now 
said andrew yorra 17 a high school senior who has been a 
listener for the past year 
the callers are encouraged to telephone as often as they want 
but not to establish a relationship with their listener 
in that case they often need ongoing professional therapy 
ms leader said 
calls are confidential and records are kept only of the callers 
age sex and type of problem listeners try however to get abuse 
victims to report their cases to the county department of child 
services for immediate action 
the hospital provides the office and phones and the hotlines 
estimated 150000 in annual costs are covered by individual 
donations and corporate grants last november an 800 number was 
established for the entire state ms leader is hoping to expand 
the service nationwide

says the trial is the longest federal criminal trial ever 
according to courtroom deputy clerk lisa horton 
one of the longest trials in history a state lawsuit in 
belleville ill against a chemical company ended in 1987 after 
3 years 
jurors here have been paid more than 175000 courtappointed 
attorneys have received an estimated 3 million the defense 
calculates the goverment paid or reimbursed cooperating witnesses 
some 300000 
thats in addition to the salaries of three prosecutors and an 
fbi agent who spent nearly two years fulltime on the case extra 
deputy marshals for security and us district judge harold a 
ackerman then theres copying costs for a mountain of documents 
obviously its been very expensive but i think its been very 
worthwhile said us attorney samuel a alito jr who came to 
the job after the case began 
i dont think anybody would say we cant go after organized 
crime just because its too expensive 
ackerman almost miraculously has been able to keep up with his 
civil calendar but he has been removed from the pool of judges 
assigned criminal cases worsening the courts backlog 
the length has taken its toll on everyone involved 
its difficult to run a town when you are down here said 
robert l brown a defense attorney who was elected mayor of orange 
in may it has caused a lot of late nights at city hall 
its taken a piece out of all of us not just our practices 
but spiritually and emotionally as well said feinstein 
one witness was on the stand for four months he was among a 
halfdozen cooperating witnesses many with criminal records 
brought to the stand by prosecutors to tell the groups inside 
story 
the defense seized on the issue telling the jury not to trust 
convicted criminals and liars the government countered by saying 
choir boys wouldnt know the mafias inner workings

dan quayles rocky entry into bigleague 
politics stumbling over questions about his military record that 
threaten to overshadow george bushs campaign has left the 
exuberant young senator bloody but seemingly unbowed 
back in the nations capital to prepare for his first solo 
campaign trip wednesday the indiana senator remains adamant that 
he is not an embarrassment to bush has not considered removing 
himself from the ticket and sees nothing improper in the way he 
entered the national guard at a time when other young men were 
marching off to fight in vietnam 
but the republican tickets public debut at the new orleans 
convention and on a threeday midwestern campaign swing saw these 
extraordinary events 
quayle asked at a new orleans news conference about his 
reasons for going into the national guard in 1969 stumbling over 
his thoughts and finally declaring i did not know in 1969 that i 
would be in this room today i confess 
quayle standing in mock attention before a republican party 
farewell convention breakfast reciting to the uneasy audience his 
name rank and serial number and proclaiming indiana national 
guard six years and proud of it 
quayle surrounded by reporters and a raucously partisan crowd 
in his hometown of huntington ind asserting i got into the 
national guard fairly but acknowledging that he assumed a friend 
of his wealthy publishing family made calls on his behalf after 
quayle expressed interest in joining the guard 
quayle telling reporters in cleveland ohio that he could not 
recall what communications he had with his draft board 20 years ago 
but insisting he distinctly remembered having no conversation in 
the 1980s with a pennsylvania democrat quoted as saying quayle 
told him he rode out vietnam in the guard 
bush calling the controversy a tempest in a teapot and 
asserting that his initial campaign swing has gone great except 
for this frenzy of media interest in quayles military record 
whether that assessment is accurate remains to be seen 
quayle seems likely to continue to have to fight portrayals of 
himself as a wealthy young man who spoke in favor of the vietnam 
war but had strings pulled to avoid the draft as his college 
student deferment was about to expire 
bush a navy bomber pilot who saw extensive combat in world war 
ii defended his running mate saying that the vietnam war years in 
which quayle now 41 pondered his own military service were 
different times 
as for quayle being vulnerable in the area of defense an area 
in which bush has portrayed michael dukakis as weak the vice 
president said the difference between the person im running 
against and my running mate are night and day on defense 
bush aides insist they are happy with how quayle has handled 
himself in publicly answering questions about his military record 
quayle himself says he does not feel the issue has overshadowed 
bush 
but there was a clear change in campaign strategy after quayles 
outdoor news conference friday that was piped over a public address 
system to quayles hometown supporters their booing of reporters 
questions and cheering of quayles answers helped create a 
circuslike atmosphere reminiscent of a roman gladiatorial bout 
while bush remained out of sight in a holding room 
that day on which the ticket opened its first joint campaign 
trip in the nations heartland quayle dominated news stories about 
the event 
the next day bush took charge defending his running mate in no 
uncertain terms at a joint news conference and declaring that 
quayles qualifications and background had been examined to his 
satisfaction 
bush said his aides had to spend a lot of time last week running 
down rumor after insidious rumor and added that the 
controversy is behind us 
however some questions may yet need to be answered 
there have been conflicting reports for example on whether 
there were vacancies in the guard at the time quayle entered or 
whether there was a waiting list quayle has said he cannot recall 
those kinds of details 
and he has not spelled out publicly the extent of his knowledge 
about what calls were made on his behalf or to whom they were made 
a retired guard official who is a friend of quayles family and 
worked for the family newspaper has said he did contact the guard 
on quayles behalf the commander of the guard unit to which quayle 
was assigned however has said he did not receive a call from 
anyone urging quayles enlistment 
quayle insists that no rules were broken in the way he 
entered the guard he says he was willing to serve in vietnam had 
his unit been called up although he concedes that he was generally 
aware the likelihood of that happening was not great 
quayle has been angered at implications that he was trying to 
avoid the draft although he has tried to appear unperturbed 
throughout the controversy over the weekend quayle appeared not 
to hear some spectators chants of quayle who went in your 
place or to see signs reading this quayle is a chicken 
he seems to be philosophical about the most intense and public 
scrutiny of his meteoric political career 
im in politics in what they call the big leagues quayle 
says adding running for the vice presidency is a definite 
honor

foreign policy is getting very little 
attention from the candidates as the campaign gets started the 
republicans seem to be content to play vaguely on george bushs 
experience while the democrats are saying even less 
even so the basic approach of the two parties is becoming 
clear bush and his running mate sen daniel quayle intend to 
sound the traditional conservative themes of a powerful military 
structure and keeping a wary eye on the russians 
dukakis and his running mate sen lloyd bentsen are playing 
down ideology and playing up competence being careful to 
strike a skeptical stance on the soviets while sounding the peace 
theme 
both sides are bound to get more specific in the 2 months of 
campaigning ahead its likely to get sticky bush will be 
challenged about the reagan administrations secret arms sale to 
iran while dukakis lack of foreign policy experience will be 
tested over a wide range of issues 
dont look for foreign policy treatises though campaigning for 
president in the television age encourages snappy or catchy 
oneliners not a thoughtful exposition of how the candidates stand 
on tricky arms control issues the arabisrael dispute leftist 
movements in central america and apartheid in south africa 
besides politicians and their managers operate on the theory 
the voters are far more concerned with pocketbook issues such as 
jobs and inflation than with american foreign policy 
there have been striking exceptions and mixed results franklin 
d roosevelt ran for a fourth term as president in 1944 while the 
united states was still at war the overriding issue was whether to 
take a chance on changing leaders the voters stuck with roosevelt 
in 1972 on the other hand george mcgovern the democratic 
candidate ran primarily as an antiwar candidate whose opposition 
to american involvement in vietnam and cambodia was the central 
theme of his futile race against president richard nixon 
the 1988 campaign is just now unfolding but there is no reason 
to believe either the republicans or democrats will give that sort 
of weight to a single foreign policy issue 
in fact the selections of quayle and bentsen suggest the 
presidential candidates intend to place the focus elsewhere 
bushs choice of quayle is above all a gesture to the gops most 
conservative elements while dukakis chose bentsen primarily for 
his experience in congress and his ties to conservative democrats 
especially in texas 
in 1960 when nixon was pondering a running mate for his first 
race for the presidency he assembled 36 party elders at a midnight 
meeting in chicago the governor of illinois william stratton 
offered this advice you can say all you want about foreign 
affairs but what is really important is the price of hogs in 
chicago 
nixon picked henry cabot lodge who had served as the us 
permanent representative at the united nations they lost to john 
kennedy and lyndon johnson but nixons explanation as recalled by 
former undersecretary of state warren christopher may still be 
relevant if you ever let the democrats campaign only on domestic 
issues they will beat us our only hope is to keep it on foreign 
policy 
that doesnt mean however that the candidate has to be an 
expert on the pecking order in the kremlin the history of the west 
bank or the strengths and weaknesses of the nicaraguan economy 
ronald reagan won in 1980 without any experience in foreign 
affairs he lacked the background to be specific about foreign 
policy issues but he had a welldeveloped image of opposing 
communism and he relied on generalities whenever dealing with the 
soviets the primary foreign policy issue of our time came to 
the fore 
reagan is leaving office on an entirely different note 
he has held four summit meetings with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev and signed a treaty with moscow to scrap 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
bush his vice president is trying to capitalize on the 
improvement in ussoviet relations suggesting he is far more 
capable than dukakis to maintain the momentum 
the fact that reagan like dukakis was inexperienced when he 
ran for the presidency is not stopping bush from questioning the 
credentials of his opponent

afghanistans sovietbacked government was 
responsible for repeated attacks on civilian targets in pakistan in 
1987 and carried out well over half of all incidents of 
statesponsored terrorism worldwide in that year a state 
department report said today 
the report titled patterns of global terrorism 1987 was 
completed before the incident last wednesday in which a pakistani 
c130 crashed claiming the lives of president mohammed zia ulhaq 
us ambassador arnold l raphel brig gen herbert m wassom and 
27 others 
pakistani officials believe terrorists were responsible and a 
us official said afghan agents have to be among the suspects 
because of the stepped up campaign afghan authorities are alleged 
to be carrying out against pakistan 
the conflict between the two countries stems from pakistani 
support for afghan rebels based in pakistan who are fighting the 
kabul government and pakistans role as a haven for millions of 
afghan refugees 
state department spokesman charles redman said sunday that any 
comments on the cause of the crash would be speculative because 
investigators including us experts flown to pakistan are just 
beginning their work 
redman spoke at andrews air force where the remains of raphel 
and wassom were flown and a ceremony was held that included remarks 
by secretary of state george p shultz and defense secretary frank 
carlucci 
acting pakistani president ghulam ishaq khan said saturday his 
government suspects last wednesday crash was the result of sabotage 
judging from the circumstances of the tragedy enemies of 
pakistan are actively posing a threat to the security of our 
country ishaq khan said 
paul kriesburg a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said it would be a mistake to assume 
automatically that afghan agents were responsible for the crash 
because zia had many other enemies they included some from within 
the pakistani military and others who were alienated by his 
authoritarian rule 
the state department report said afghan agents carried out 127 
of the 189 incidents last year attributable to statesponsored 
terrorism 
iran was second with 44 and libya followed with seven the 
report said 
all told there were 832 international terrorist incidents last 
year when the pakistani numbers are subtracted the number of 
incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent 
from 1986 statistics it said 
the report said the afghan campaign had been largely limited to 
the northwest part of pakistan where rebel forces are based but 
spread to major cities last year 
it said the campaign is being waged by the afghan ministry of 
state security known by the acronym wad 
zia said last november that the assassinations and bombings 
carried out against pakistani civilians were at the behest of the 
soviet union but moscow has denied the allegation 
us and pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by 
afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in pakistan the 
bloodiest incident occurred in july 1987 when three car bombs 
exploded in the main bazaar of karachi killing 72 and injuring 260 
the report said it is likely that the soviets have been aware of 
afghan operations in pakistan because of the close ties between wad 
and the soviet intelligence agency kgb 
it said that while some of the material for the explosive 
devices can be purchased on the black market other items can be 
obtained only through soviet sources 
pakistan estimates that about 1500 soviet advisers work with 
wad

capitol hill lobbyists paced by a 
controversial social security advocacy group spent more than 6362 
million trying to influence congress in 1987 
the amount compiled from required reports filed with the house 
and senate represented a 45 percent increase from 1986 when a 
massive overhaul of the nations income tax laws spurred big 
spending by registered lobbyists 
the 1986 total of 6087 million by some 8500 individuals and 
organizations was up from 49 million in 1985 and at the time was 
the highest total since the associated press began compiling the 
figures in 1983 
the national committee to preserve social security led the pack 
last year with a reported outlay of 293 million much of it for 
directmail campaigns designed to flood congressional offices with 
letters from senior citizens 
headed by james roosevelt the son of president franklin delano 
roosevelt the organization has drawn fire from members of congress 
who say it uses scare tactics to obtain contributions from the 
elderly 
roosevelt has defended the lobbying group saying our cause is 
a good one our methods are honest our concerns are sincere 
the 293 million was slightly below the 3 million in lobbying 
expenses reported by the group for 1986 when it finished in second 
place behind the 302 million spent by citizens for sensible 
control of acid rain 
that group bankrolled principally by electric utilities and 
coal companies decreased its 1987 lobbying expenses to 12 
million leaving it in eighth place among nine organizations 
spending more than 1 million last year 
second spot in 1987 was occupied by perennial bigspender common 
cause the selfdescribed citizens lobby that concentrates on 
government ethics and election finance reform and attributes its 
entire budget to lobbying 
common cause spent 256 million last year just ahead of the 
255 million reported by a tobacco company philip morris usa 
which used directmail campaigns to oppose any increase in federal 
excise taxes on tobacco products 
philip morris spent about half its total in the final quarter of 
1987 its fourthquarter outlay of 127 million was the highest by 
any lobbying group for a threemonth period last year 
the committee to protect the family ranked fourth in overall 
spending last year with 195 million followed by sierra clubs 
15 million to support lobbying on environment and conservation 
issues 
the biggest spender among organized labor last year was the 
national association of letter carriers at 148 million the other 
millionplus spenders were the fiber fabric and apparel coalition 
for trade with 124 million and the home recording rights 
coalition with nearly 118 million 
the coalition a consortium of audio component companies has 
been battling on capitol hill for several years against the 
recording industry association of america composed of record and 
tape manufacturers 
the coalitions spending was far ahead of the 331280 reported 
by the recording association in the struggle over whether congress 
will restrict use of or impose royalty fees on digital audio tape 
the newest kid on the highfidelity block 
the continuing congressional debate over handgun control again 
accounted for heavy lobbying expenses with a group pushing for 
firearms restrictions handgun control inc leading spending in 
this area with 900343 
the procontrol forces were outgunned however by collective 
spending by their opponents national rifle association of america 
668058 gun owners of america 608672 and citizens committee 
for the right to keep and bear arms 271435 
other large spenders last year included american petroleum 
institute 919419 project cure 909018 free the eagle 
896555 railway labor executives association 800293 rainbow 
lobby 765329 and us league of savings institutions 728803

michael dukakis is emphasizing national campaign 
themes as he visits northeastern massachusetts a region the 
democratic presidential nominee often cites when discussing his 
record of economic development 
as he did during a visit to central massachusetts last week 
dukakis is kicking off the visit with a meeting attended by area 
elected officials educators and business and labor leaders 
the massachusetts governor also planned today to distribute 
grants for a new manufacturing research center and for improvements 
at the middlesex community college campus in lowell 
from there dukakis was to attend an event to promote his 
homeownership opportunity program which provides state assistance 
to low and moderateincome families looking to buy homes 
dukakis was to return to the northeastern corner of the state 
tuesday for several more events he frequently mentions the 
northeastern massachusetts communities of lawrence and lowell both 
former mill cities when discussing his efforts to spur economic 
development in economically depressed areas 
dukakis spent sunday at his brookline home where he returned 
late saturday night after a fourday campaign swing through parts 
of minnesota florida alabama illinois missouri arkansas texas 
and tennessee 
that trip started in the middle of the republican national 
convention and was part of a campaign effort to keep dukakis 
visible during the gop gathering 
aides billed the trip as highly successful dukakis revealed no 
new positions on issues but was widely covered in the national news 
media particularly after republican nominee george bushs 
selection of sen dan quayle as a running mate sparked controversy 
questions have centered on quayles use of his wealthy familys 
influence to help him join the national guard and avoid the draft 
at the height of the vietnam war 
dukakis at virtually every stop indirectly criticized quayle and 
bushs judgment for choosing him dukakis repeatedly discussed the 
lenthy senate record of his own running mate sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas telling crowds the true test of presidential leadership 
should be the quality of people selected to fill key positions 
after spending today and tuesday in massachusetts dukakis plans 
to campaign wednesday and thursday in washington dc ohio and 
pennsylvania he is scheduled to be back in boston on friday and 
then back in the nations capital saturday to participate in a 
march marking the 25th anniversary of the civil rights march on 
washington led by martin luther king jr

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen has wellknown differences with michael dukakis over contra 
aid the mx missile and school prayer but reporters covering his 
justended texas swing found another one 
lloyd bentsen is a pedaltothemetal guy 
dukakis fidgets at his driver when his car edges above 
massachusetts 55 mph speed limit 
but the texas senator told how long his entourage would take 
for a drive from brownsville to mission revealed his motoring 
style id make it a lot faster if the secret service werent 
around he said 
lloyd bentsen is a texan who doesnt like to waste time hes up 
early does his campaigning on schedule and gets it finished on 
time though thats sometimes late in the evening 
his walk and his gestures which seem stiff on capitol hill 
make more sense in the texas summer sun theres not a lot of 
wasted motion observed one aide 
and hes doing something on the road that reporters who cover 
him in washington almost never see 
hes having fun 
more often than not bentsen strolls back to the press section 
of his plane and tell reporters of the last event that was 
great 
when the campaign jet goes noseup on takeoff the television 
crews bowl an orange up from the back of the plane after a week of 
failed attempts they scored by getting one into the cockpit 
bentsen who had been casually monitoring the progress of these 
efforts grabbed the fruit and took out his pen afttocabin 
award he wrote and he signed it dated it and rolled it back 
the orange was mounted to the ceiling where it hung as a trophy 
until the end of the trip sunday night 
rarely quotable and known for his attention to detail in the 
senate bentsen now seems to relish making those quick quips that 
ignite campaign rhetoric and hes even cracking a few jokes 
when reporters groaned about the length of the nineday trip 
bentsen smiled i get timeandahalf after five days he said 
hearing that george bush said the republicans would fight like 
pit bulls bentsen replied therell probably be enough bull to 
go around 
at midweek after republican george bush picked 41yearold 
indiana sen dan quayle the 67year bentsen wasnt going to let 
himself be seen as the old man of the campaign he increased the 
dumbbell weights for his morning treadmill exercise from four 
pounds to five pounds 
its not the miles on you its the depth of the tread he 
said of the age gap 
after a tedious session of satellite feeds in a dallas 
television station bentsen cleaned up and emerging from his 
makeup shouted hey remember me im the 41yearold guy 
bentsen and his wife of 45 years beryl ann were together 
almost constantly he always introducing her as ba that 
stands for bentsens best asset the former model would sometimes 
fuss over his hair if it was out of place 
one morning in east texas the two campaigned separately until 
she rejoined him while he was doing some interviews it took a 
moment for him to spot her what a good lookin woman you are 
are you spoken for he exclaimed 
mrs bentsen chats with reporters less frequently than the 
senator but on one plane ride she was asked if she would mind a 
personal question she seemed a little reluctant but went along 
is it true she was asked halfjokingly that the senator has a 
body of a 41yearold she replied without hesitation 
you bet no question about it she said 
always looking for a gaffe reporters have found slim pickings 
in the veteran bentsen one of his infrequent mistakes came when 
one attempt at humor seemed inappropriate 
asked about president reagans strategic defense initiative 
which promises to shoot down enemy nuclear warheads bentsen 
expressed his doubts if even one got through he said it will 
ruin your whole day 
bentsen clearly was comfortable campaigning texas his native 
state where he was first elected to the senate in 1970 his gave 
his stump speech in some of the hottest places on the planet and 
usually he emerged looking fresh and crisp 
it was so hot in a wool warehouse in san angelo that bentsens 
shirt was sticking to his body as he discussed the cattle business 
with local citizens 
but in a few minutes he was cleaned up and strolling to his next 
speech at a nearby park 
the bentsen entourage includes experts from dukakis campaign to 
help advise him and coordinate the democratic ticket but when a 
herd of cattle charged and cut off the press bus at the lbj ranch 
the dukakis people were stumped and guessed wildly when reporters 
wanted to know what they were 
oh nonsense they were just whiteface declared bentsen 
who grew up on his fathers ranch

a soviet rocket that plummeted to earth in 
northeastern canada put on a spectacular light show for residents 
of the western and northern united states but it was not all that 
unusual in other respects pentagon officials say 
the craft that crashed sunday causing no reported injuries or 
damage was also not cosmos 1900 the soviet spy satellite that has 
been drifting out of orbit for several months and arousing concern 
because it is nuclearpowered 
the rocket had been launched last thursday to boost a gorizont 
communications satellite into orbit said maj alex mondragon 
spokesman for the north american aerospace defense command and the 
us space command speaking from peterson air force base near 
colorado springs 
the vehicle which came down at about 1 am edt was most 
likely an sl12 one of the most frequently used soviet launchers 
he said 
the craft was tracked by officials at the us space 
surveillance center at cheyenne mountain in colorado where about 
7200 space vehicles are constantly being observed an average of 
one space vehicle reenters the earths atmosphere each day 
mondragon said 
its not unusual for a rocket body not to stay in orbit he 
said theres nothing to keep it there 
cosmos 1900 launched last dec 12 is now expected to reenter 
the earths atmosphere in late september or early october 
mondragon said 
mondragon and pentagon spokesman maj mike stepp provided no 
further details about the crafts condition when it reached the 
earth or the precise location where it came down 
mondragon said it usually takes about 24 hours to pinpoint where 
downed satellites plummet to earth 
the spokesmen said the descending rocket was visible to 
residents of new mexico colorado nebraska and michigan 
i do understand it was pretty spectacular stepp said 
he said the downing of the craft which he referred to as a 
nonnuclear soviet rocket body was expected by us officials 
it was predicted it would come down it came down as predicted 
and it came down where it was predicted he said 
mondragon said officials do not try to recover parts of such 
rocket bodies because 95 percent of them usually burn up upon 
reentry 
that spectacular light show that they provide folks with is 
the rocket body burning up he said

once despised by white house budget trimmers as something local 
communities and private citizens ought to do for themselves the 
bampi loans handled by the departments farmers home 
administration have enjoyed new status in recent years 
the financial battering of farmers in the early 1980s the 
hardships that hit the economy of smalltown america and the 
insistent demands of congress have helped jog the administration 
into a new look at rural development 
for the fiscal year that began last oct 1 according to fmha 
spokesman marlyn aycock bampi loan guarantees are expected to use 
the full 957 million authorized by congress the second year in a 
row that has happened 
according to fmha records the bampi volume soared to more than 1 
billion in 197980 before winding down under the reagan 
administration which unsuccessfully for several years advocated 
elimination of the program 
the usdas budget office in presenting proposals for fiscal 
1984 for example explained the reasons for seeking reduction or 
elimination of many of the fmha community programs including sewer 
and water assistance and bampi 
reductions in rural development program loans and grants 
reflect the administrations philosophy that private sector 
investment not public sector pump priming should drive 
development the usda said the federal role in the rural 
sector will be limited to that of lender of last resort in 
providing water sewer and community facilities essential to the 
health and safety of households where most needed in rural areas 
congress reduced annual authorizations for bampi in the early 
1980s and the administration kept the actual loan level far below 
that in 1984 for example when bampi was authorized at 200 
million the actual lending level was held to 124 million 
lending dropped to 61 million in 1985 and to 55 million in 
1986 then in 1987 when congress set the authority for bampi at 
957 million the full amount was used for the first time during 
the reagan administration 
aycock said that as of this april the bampi program had 2238 
loans outstanding for a total of 182 billion of those 475 
loans or 21 percent were delinquent a total of 230 million 
in its 16 years the bampi program has provided more than 7000 
guaranteed loans totaling nearly 6 billion according to the 
background information provided by fmha at the request of the 
associated press 
bampi was authorized by congress in 1972 to provide loans for 
the purpose of improving developing or financing business 
industry and employment and improving the economic and 
environmental climate in rural communities including pollution 
abatement and control 
an example of the programs intent was a 1974 loan to american 
cotton growers lubbock texas for 282 million to finance a new 
denim manufacturing plant in littlefield near the fields where 
cotton grew two more loans brought the total to 335 million 
jobs were created for more than 600 people and a ready market 
was provided for plains cotton the agency said it was made 
into highquality denim much of which was bought by levi strauss 
over the years the loan was paid in full on aug 4 1987 
some more recent examples include 
2 million for fishco inc belzoni miss to help build a 
catfish processing plant with a capacity of 40 million pound per 
year the plant is expected to employ 432 people when running at 
full capacity 
2 million for stoneville furniture company inc stoneville 
nc to buy equipment and machinery funds also will be used for 
working capital the plant employs approximately 700 
45 million for fairmont foods of minnesota inc fairmont 
minn to buy and reopen a food processing plant and to purchase 
new machinery and equipment to produce frozen processed foods the 
project will create 234 jobs 
the bampi loan program over the years also has been used for 
cotton gins the manufacture of radar guns used by police a 
shrimp farm in hawaii a chicken processing a radio station 
automobile dealerships and plants to make fuelgrade ethanol 
as another recent usda report described program operations 
ventures range from the processing and marketing of coffee beans 
and macadamia nuts in hawaii to the manufacturing of equipment to 
convert solid waste to boiler fuel in alaska 
under the recently enacted 39 billion droughtaid package the 
fmha was ordered to use bampi to the maximum extent possible to 
help businesses adversely affected by drought 
congress included 200 million for guaranteed loans to rural 
businesses and organizations to recover from drought losses those 
loans will have a lid of 500000 per individual

panamas defense forces say charges 
that its troops are harassing us troops are part of a 
psychological war designed to destabilize the government of gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
the statement released late sunday said us officials who 
reportedly accused the panamanian government of deliberately 
sanctioning attacks on americans must have the iq of a 3yearold 
cromagnon 
us officials in the panamanian capital said sunday that us 
personnel have reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by 
panamanian authorities this year including attempts to extort 
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail 
pdf panama defense forces members have been notably less 
courteous in dealing with our people said an official at the 
us southern command who spoke on condition of anonymity 
us sanctions aimed at ousting noriega who has been indicted 
by two federal grand juries in florida on drug trafficking charges 
were applied in march and have damaged panamas economy 
panamas defense forces said the harassment reports sought to 
destabilize panama and immerse it in chaos an indispensible step 
for not fulfilling and to annul the panama canal treaties and 
particularly to prolong the us military presence beyond the year 
2000 when the united states has agreed to turn the canal over to 
panama 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy in panama 
city said sunday that the reports of harassment are coming from 
us military personnel 
civilians business people and embassy personnel have reported 
no increase in harassment she said 
she said she was not sure whether us military personnel are 
being bothered more or are simply reporting more cases 
the latest incident occurred when panamanian officials blocked 
us trucks from picking up mail at torrijos international airport 
for three days last week a second southern command official said 
the official also speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
dispute was satisfactorily settled a panamanian official called 
the dispute a bureaucratic misunderstanding 
the us official said 240 cases of harassment were reported 
from february to august whats going on these days has been 
going on for months going way back to last year 
one of the things thats happening is that a lot of people are 
being asked for bribes when theyre stopped for traffic violations 
and thats probably because the police arent getting paid 
regularly the official said but if a case like that is 
reported it goes down as harassment 
the new york times on sunday quoted southern command state and 
defense department officials as saying there have recently been an 
increasing number of beatings abductions rape and extortion of 
us military personnel and their dependents 
the story under a washington dateline said the us officials 
view the incidents as a campaign by the noriega regime to pressure 
the united states to lift economic sanctions against panama 
however southern command officials disagreed with the reported 
motive and one official said the increased harassment could be 
just an indication of individual frustration and anger 
the panama defense forces statement said the supposed us 
government officials cited by the times must have the iq of a 
threeyearold cromagnon when they assert that actions taken by 
the panama defense forces against us military personnel are 
attempts to force the reagan administration to lift or soften 
economic sanctions imposed on panama 
the statement said us troops cause daily problems for 
panamanian authorities including fights mistreatment of women 
venereal disease shooting in public places and refusing to pay bar 
and restaurant tabs 
us sanctions were applied after noriega ousted president eric 
arturo delvalle delvalle has since been in hiding but the united 
states continues to recognize him as panamas legitimate president 
about 12000 us servicemen are stationed in panama by treaty 
to protect the panama canal a vital waterway linking the atlantic 
and pacific oceans they are attached to the southern command 
which is in charge of all us military operations south of the 
usmexico border

the soviet union in an unusual display of 
openness has agreed to allow us researchers to see oceans of 
archives that one historian says show incidences of collaboration 
with nazi occupation forces in world war ii 
after a preliminary survey of the material this month our 
historians tell us they have seen documents that have not been seen 
by western eyes for the past 40 years said miles lerman 
chairman of the committee of international relations for the united 
states holocaust memorial council 
lerman signed an agreement july 29 in moscow which will allow 
us historians to photograph the documents for storage in the 
holocaust museum congress has authorized the council to build on 
the washington mall by 1991 
the soviets also will receive microfilm and microfiche copies of 
the documents made at the expense of the us council 
by microfilming and microfiching the documents we extend their 
shelf life for by at least 300 years said lerman thats one 
of the things that turned them around 
the kremlin has long blocked western and soviet historians from 
viewing archives including those from the period of nazi 
occupation and us historians attribute the shift to the reform 
policies of mikhail s gorbachev 
this is a 180degree turn around in the attitude of the soviet 
authorities said raul hilberg a university of vermont historian 
who accompanied lerman on his trip to moscow and reviewed documents 
in the soviet capital and other cities 
its a humongous amount oceans and oceans of material in 
three dozen archives administered by glav archiv for the soviet 
council of ministers said lerman 
the archives will not be opened to soviets said lerman and 
hilberg 
in the past the soviets have given the west piecemeal archival 
materials such as the identification card that was crucial in the 
conviction last april of john demjanjuk he was sentenced to death 
in israel for operating gas chambers at treblinka the nazi camp in 
poland where hundreds of thousands died 
hilberg who has been studying holocaust documents for 40 years 
said the soviet archives provide extraordinary detail of the 
daytoday operation of nazi death camps and the security forces 
under german occupation 
the collaboration was much greater in areas held by the soviet 
union for brief periods of time before the war higher in the 
west ukraine than in the east higher in the baltic buffer states 
and eastern poland said hilberg 
those areas were annexed by the soviet union under the secret 
provisions of a nazisoviet treaty signed the month before germany 
invaded poland in 1939 starting world war ii 
material in the archives shows the transformation of the human 
psyche during the nazi occupation said hilberg the drastic 
nature of the german occupation was such that the effect on the 
population was dramatic this was true not only of jews who were 
killed but those who watched it 
in one document hilberg reviewed in the soviet archives a 
german officer wrote that antisemitism was decreasing among 
latvians in 1943 after nearly all the jews in that baltic 
republic had been killed and the soviets started to drive the nazis 
out said hilberg 
the latvians said hilberg saw they had thrown in their lot 
with the germans they virtually exterminated the jewish population 
there and then they had second thoughts as the soviets turned 
the tide of battle 
altogether in this country we may have underestimated the 
extent to which people in the soviet union were subjected to the 
occupation we might have had a different relationship with the 
soviet union if we had known this 
but the soviets were secretive apparently trying to hide the 
weaknesses of communism and in some cases the degree to which 
people collaborated he said 
photographing the documents might take about a year and cost 1 
million to 15 million hilberg said 
the microfilm will be housed in the holocaust museum a 200000 
square foot structure to be built adjacent to the bureau of 
printing and engraving near the washington monument for an 
estimated cost of 90 million raised from private donations 
the holocaust council consisting of 55 members appointed by the 
president and five each from the house and senate plans to raise 
an additional 53 million as a permanent endowment for the museum 
said spokesman samuel eshkenazi

a suspicious fire at a crowded social club 
killed seven and injured more than 30 as panicked patrons clawed 
against the walls and doors trying to flee leaving those who 
escaped one step from death 
between 60 and 100 people were in the bronx club known as el 
hoyo the hole when the blaze ignited shortly after noon sunday 
said john mulligan a fire department spokesman 
five bodies were found inside the gutted club and two people 
died later authorities said 
screaming patrons in the basement club fought for the lone exit 
up a stairway where the fire apparently started authorities said 
some broke through a rear wall and were pulled to safety by 
firefighters 
some who escaped joined bystanders in rushing back in to try to 
save others getting in the way of firefighters and even grabbing 
their tools firefighters said 
it was sheer panic said firefighter dennis fennell it 
looked like people tried to claw out all of the walls 
we had to break a door to get to the first floor then we 
had to break in the gate and some people helped from outside to 
open the gate said luis done one of those who escaped 
i was one step from death i feel very lucky 
all of a sudden i saw the flames come from the bar area there 
was a lot of flames it was very fast all of a sudden whoosh 
said another patron francisco delarosa 32 
investigators were testing material from the basement for the 
presence of flammable liquid according to mulligan who said the 
fire was suspicious because it spread rapidly 
up to 150 firefighters battled nearly three hours to bring the 
fire under control 
there was so much fire blowing out into the street that water 
didnt have any effect on it in the initial stages said fire 
capt james gallagher 
the club was in a lowceiling 50by75foot basement of a row 
of stores and divided into smaller rooms 
the bodies of four men and one woman were found toward the front 
of the club gallagher said 
he said one poor guy was found with his face in the wall like 
he was trying to crawl into a corner 
there was no evidence of a posted license at the club mulligan 
said taverns are prohibited in basements and there werent enough 
exits to satisfy building codes said deputy fire chief philip j 
burns 
firefighters were met by hysterical civilians streaming up the 
staircase mulligan said one firefighter told me he literally 
had to fight his way down the stairs 
most escaped through the clubs small front door and narrow 
staircase but others were able to break through a wall near the 
back he said a second door on the side of the club was locked 
shut he said 
firefighter joseph kisonas said hysterical people outside the 
club were trying to fight the tools away from us so they could 
reenter and help others 
three patrons broke through a rear wall and our guys pulled 
them out of the rubble and gypsum board mulligan said 
mayor edward i koch who toured the scene described the club 
as a rabbit warren 
its clear that it should have never been opened in the first 
place he said of the club 
most of the injured including six firefighters and two 
emergency medical service technicians suffered smoke inhalation 
and were taken to hospitals mulligan said 
sundays fire was reminiscent of an oct 24 1976 arson fire at 
a bronx social club that killed 25 and injured more than 30 three 
men including one who quarreled with a woman at the club were 
convicted of setting the fire on the clubs only staircase

new orleans last week and had gone from a lower elevation to a 
higher elevation and her body wouldnt tolerate it said bennett

about 400 workers carrying the polish flag 
and chanting solidarity marched through the lenin shipyard to 
its main gate on monday and proclaimed a strike the yards second 
this year 
the outlawed free trade federation solidarity had urged the 
shipyards 10000 workers to join a string of occupation strikes 
demanding union recognition and wage increases 
at least 10 coal mines in southern poland and transit and 
dockworkers in the baltic port of szczecin remained on strike on 
the seventh day of polands worst wave of labor unrest since 1981 
at least 76000 workers were idled 
solidarity leader lech walesa offered sunday to suspend his call 
for a gdansk shipyard strike if the government agreed to talks on 
the labor strife 
but the offer went unheeded 
there was no sign of police interference as 2 hours after the 
day shift began workers took over the main gate of the shipyard 
where solidarity was born in may the yard was the scene of an 
8day strike that ended inconclusively 
we warn the authorities that in case force is used against the 
striking workforce the full responsibility for the consequences 
will lie with polish authorities strike leaders in szczecin said 
in a statement late sunday 
police and riot troops were seen gathering around two szczecin 
shipyards which have not gone on strike strike leaders said they 
also patrolled the streets of gdansk 
striking dockworkers in szczecin fearing a police raid said 
they had rolled cranes and other equipment to block the entrances 
to the port which they have been occupying since wednesday 
interfactory strike committee member jozef kowalczyk said at 6 
am that the night had passed without incident 
in jastrzebie the center of the coalmine strikes in the 
southwestern silesia region miners on monday published the first 
edition of a strike newspaper and management and workers exchanged 
letters setting forth their positions on undertaking talks 
walesa speaking at st brygidas church sunday to about 3000 
union supporters said authorities had approached him through 
unofficial channels about holding talks but gave few details 
he said he expected the governments reply to be delivered on 
the national television news sunday evening but the news devoted 
mainly to the existing strikes across poland carried no mention of 
walesa and no hint about talks 
instead the commentator suggested the strikes would continue 
tomorrow poland will enter the second week of strikes and we 
will continue estimating the losses for our economy said tv news 
announcer waldemar milewicz 
a spokesman in the government press office in warsaw also had no 
comment on walesas remarks 
after watching the newscast at st brygidas walesa brushed 
past reporters and went home saying only that his earlier 
statements stood 
meanwhile the solidarity committee of the nowa huta steel mill 
outside krakow issued a statement sunday calling on steelworkers to 
support strikers demands at the proper moment 
solidarity the first independent union in the soviet bloc was 
founded in the gdansk shipyard in 1980 it was suppressed in a 
december 1981 military crackdown after massive strikes and outlawed 
the next fall 
the governmentcontrolled media has called the current strikes 
illegal and and stressed their rising cost to the economy but it 
has made no clear statement on the governments plans 
polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski met saturday with top 
military leaders the staterun pap news agency said they made 
appropriate decisions in connection with the present 
threats but it was not known what they decided 
walesa the 1983 nobel peace prize laureate told the crowd at 
st brygidas that he wanted to avoid a strike 
we cannot pull poland out of her troubles by means of 
strikes he said we are ready for dialogue and talks 
police barred priests from entering the july manifesto mine in 
silesia sunday morning to say mass angering striking miners who 
had to listen over loudspeakers but dockworkers were permitted 
religious services at the idled port in szczecin 
at szczecin the countrys secondbusiest port after gdansk 
about 500 dockworkers attended a mass according to a strike 
committee spokesman reached by telephone about 200 sympathizers 
and family members listened to the mass from beyond the port gates 
but at the coal mine in jastrzebie where the labor unrest began 
tuesday angry erupted when authorities barred two priests from 
entering 
strike leaders pleaded for 90 minutes for the clergymen to be 
let in as hundreds of strikers chanted we want the priests we 
want the priests 
but when authorities would not relent a makeshift altar made 
and the mass was broadcast over loudspeakers to those inside 
pap claimed sunday that the wildcat strikes are controlled by 
a narrow group of people who do not hide their political aims 
it said several thousand miners had signed declarations that 
they want to return to work

an emaciated cesar chavez broke bread to 
end his 36day fast at an outdoor mass but urged thousand of 
cheering supporters to continue his battle against california table 
grape growers 
the 61yearold union leader appeared gaunt and drawn sunday as 
he was assisted to the mass with his arms draped around the necks 
of his sons anthony and paul 
today i pass on the fast for life to hundreds of concerned 
men and women throughout north america and the world who have 
offered to share the suffering said chavez in a statement read 
by his eldest son fernando 
the fast will go on in hundreds of distant places and it will 
multiply among thousands and then millions of caring people until 
every poisoned grape is off the supermarket shelves 
after the mass chavez who lost 33 pounds or 19 percent of his 
174 pounds during the wateronly fast was taken from the union 
compound in this community 150 miles north of los angeles to an 
undisclosed location 
he was to be put on a liquid diet including light broth and 
noncitrus juices that will last up to 10 days said one of his 
physicians dr marion moses 
it was not known if he would suffer longterm complications from 
the fast which began july 17 and was his longest but there were 
no plans to place him in a hospital said moses 
chavez a vegetarian began the fast in good health and remained 
mentally sharp throughout she said 
he endured stomach cramps dehydration vomiting dizziness and 
other ailments in his effort to bring attention to the united farm 
workers 4yearold boycott of california table grapes the union 
said workers and consumers face a greater risk of cancer from the 
five pesticides used on california table grapes 
but grape growers and grocers have said chavez and the union 
have unduly frightened consumers about the safety of table grapes 
in an effort to fight a political battle 
the rev jesse jackson who sought this years democratic 
presidential nomination began a threeday fast as chavez ended 
his other politicians and celebrities including actors martin 
sheen and robert blake have promised to fast for two or three days 
as well 
im here in a great tradition because bobby kennedy would have 
been here martin luther king would have been here they can kill 
the dreamers but they cant kill the dream jackson said 
when the grape boycott began in 1984 chavez accused the state 
agricultural labor relations board which governs farm labor 
elections of becoming a tool of republican gov george deukmejian 
chavez raised the pesticide issue in 1986 and called for 
captan dinoseb phosdrin methyl bromide and parathion to be taken 
off the market 
about 6000 supporters attended the roman catholic communion 
service under a giant white tent an event reminiscent of the end 
of chavezs 25day fast in 1968 to protest escalating violence in 
the fields and gain recognition of the fledgling union 
sen robert f kennedy broke bread with chavez that day as his 
widow ethel did sunday besides the consecrated wafer chavez ate 
only a few crumbs of bread fed to him by mrs kennedy 
jackson and mrs kennedy appeared shocked at chavezs condition 
he shook and trembled throughout the service and rarely looked up 
his doctor who sat directly behind him kept a watchful eye on him 
after he sat in a wooden rocker chavez leaned over to his 
96yearold mother who was crying and dabbed her eyes with a 
handkerchief

lunar base module sketching the future of the final frontier 
richard fouriers drawings wont stand as monuments to progress 
in space development but where they were done just might 
fournier of toulouse was one of 104 students from 21 countries 
including the soviet union who assembled on the campus of the 
massachusetts institute of technology this summer in the first 
session of the international space university 
they are scientists engineers policymakers and future 
astronauts with one thing in common they dream of a global effort 
to explore and colonize space 
students attended 240 hours of lectures on subjects such as 
orbital space debris international space law and problems of bone 
decalcification in space 
the university the first of its kind wants to set forth an 
agenda for space exploration and create a coherent space 
culture said todd b hawley its 27yearold cofounder 
over time there will be a global space culture and there has 
to be an understanding of what is possible on an international 
basis hawley said 
in 1985 hawley and cofounder peter h diamandis also 27 
formed the space generation foundation to develop ideas for 
international space exploration they raised 100000 and came up 
with ideas including a university where people from around the 
world could learn from space experts 
since a founding conference at mit in april 1987 hawley and 
diamandis have raised more than 1 million from government private 
and corporate sources including 100000 from the soviet union to 
enroll a 12student delegation about a third of the 350 students 
and professionals from around the world who applied for this years 
course were accepted and their home countries paid the 10000 fee 
we are the countries with the highest technology and we must 
cooperate said alexander prokhorov 24 a graduate student at 
the institute of aircraft technologies in moscow all peaceful 
coexistence in space is a better alternative than the strategic 
defense initiative its better to go to mars or venus together 
during the nineweek session that ended saturday students 
tested space shuttle suits operated a robot that performed a 
simulated scavenging of the lunar surface and built small lunar 
mining vehicles and tested them in sandboxes 
the 84 lecturers from 14 countries were drawn from the worlds 
top space organizations including that national aeronautics and 
space administrations jet propulsion laboratory the european 
space agency the soviet cardiology research center and the 
international telecommunications satellite organization 
the point the university makes is that with the decline of the 
american space program following the 1986 explosion of the space 
shuttle challenger the future development of space necessarily 
must be an international venture 
theres no point in america going to mars and the soviet union 
going to mars said russell hannigan 24 a spacecraft systems 
engineer with british aerospace in london its a waste of 
national resources just to do national programs 
space programs are very expensive added fabola de oliveira 
34 of brazils institute of space research which is launching its 
first data collection satellite next year as a developing 
country we have no way of really going for space programs without 
international cooperation 
the university will remain a summer school until 1992 when the 
founders hope to begin a fiveyear degree program with a permanent 
faculty a main campus and satellite campuses at the worlds top 
space centers next years program will be in either france or west 
germany 
hawleys dream of space involves everything from lunar and 
mars development to solarpowered satellites to asteroid rendezvous 
and mining to building actual colonies in space 
this is a 100year vision he said we feel very strongly 
that that can happen

the federal government should help fund 
permanent affordable housing programs to accommodate street people 
because emergency shelters have failed to curb the number of 
homeless researchers said 
the homeless should have access to the more affordable housing 
to ease dependency on crowded understaffed shelters according 
participants at a seminar sunday at the annual meeting of the 
society for the study of social problems 
the plan originally adopted by advocacy groups called for crisis 
services in emergency shelters helping homeless people 
reestablish their lives and supplying lowincome housing for 
those who could live independently said madeline stoner of the 
university of southern californias school of social work 
but that plan didnt work because many homeless people have 
turned the temporary shelters into a permanent living 
situation ms stoner said 
shelters have not only failed to stem the growth of 
homelessness their existence has served to perpetuate the homeless 
condition by keeping many in a transient state she said 
the threetiered plan was a major mistake said anita l 
beaty executive director of the task force for the homeless an 
atlanta advocacy group 
advocates and agencies should turn from shelteroriented 
services and concentrate on serving as many as possible at a low 
cost actively recruiting businesses to improve employment 
opportunities and strengthening vagrancy and public nuisance laws 
ms stoner said 
any consideration of constructing a nonhomeless future shifts 
the focus from shelters to explorations of permanent housing 
ms stoner said 
the national coalition for the homeless estimates there are two 
to three million homeless people in the united states with women 
and children comprising about 60 percent 
los angeles and new york have the highest number of homeless 
people with about 50000 in each city ms stoner said

agents seized about 5000 pounds of pure cocaine 
and 2 million in cash including some stashed in bags marked 
just say no authorities said in announcing one of the nations 
largest drug confiscations 
four people were arrested including the local leader of a 
colombian drug cartel authorities said sunday 
the cocaine with an estimated street value of 400 million was 
the largest amount confiscated in new york city said robert m 
stutman special agent in charge of the federal drug enforcement 
administrations office here 
the largest cocaine shipment ever seized in the united states 
in tampa fla on april 28 involved 9230 pounds found in plastic 
containers that were concealed in hallowedout lumber the largest 
in the new york city area occurred last month in hicksville where 
agents discovered 6000 pounds of cocaine hidden inside blocks of 
chocolate from ecuador 
only a few cocaine seizures nationally have exceeded 5000 
pounds but customs service agents in 10 months have seized 10 tons 
more cocaine than they did in all of the last fiscal year customs 
commissioner william von raab said earlier this month 
among those arrested this weekend was hernando grajales rizzo 
39 colombia a leader in the cali drug cartel stutman said 
stutman would not say when or how the smugglers brought the 
drugs into new york the drugs were found in the queens apartment 
where rizzo and two other men were arrested officials said 
the arrests were announced at a news conference where 
authorities displayed small plasticwrapped boxes containing the 
5000 pounds of cocaine and boxes of us currency 
some of the money was in supermarket bags imprinted with the 
reagan administrations slogan just say no to drugs 
the arrests would likely cause the cartel to suffer a setback 
but not end its activity in the lucrative new york market 
officials said 
i hope it will have an impact but the amount of the drugs 
coming in is very very large said chief raymond l jones of the 
city police departments organized crime control bureau the 
problem is that a 2pound 2ounce package a kilo can be broken 
down to about 14000 vials of crack that is our major problem 
the suspects will be arraigned this week authorities said

violent confrontations between arabs and jews 
inside israel have increased in recent weeks threatening to 
unravel fragile ties that have bound the two groups through 
daytoday contacts in the past 21 years 
the incidents also prompt renewed concern that it will become 
more and more difficult to confine the palestinian uprising to the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
two weeks ago an arsonist set fire to a construction site shack 
in the tel aviv suburb or yehuda three palestinians asleep in the 
shack burned to death police later arrested a 17yearold jewish 
suspect 
on sunday police arrested seven arabs on suspicion they threw 
three firebombs and a smoke bomb into the backyard of an or yehuda 
home 
also sunday a west bank resident palestinian and his two sons 
were held on suspicion they hurled a hand grenade into a packed 
outdoor mall in the mixed jewisharab city of haifa on saturday 
the blast wounded 25 israelis including an 8yearold boy whose 
feet were blown off 
in another incident three palestinians from the gaza strip were 
held on suspicion of trying to drown two jewish women near a tel 
aviv beach 
also in tel aviv a night watchman from the west bank city of 
nablus told police he was beaten up by a gang of seven jewish 
youths while guarding a construction site last week 
as the violence increases so does the hatred between the two 
communities 
if we dont manage to control the situation things might get 
worse tel aviv police chief yigal marcus told the jerusalem 
post the things happening now are not so unusual 
the national police force already overextended because of 
jewisharab violence in jerusalem and the northern galilee area 
with its large arab population had to deploy reinforcements in or 
yehuda 
but their presence has not calmed the hatred 
so what if an arab burned to death shuki calif 16 told 
the israeli hadashot newspaper whats an arab anyway he isnt 
human let 2000 more of them burn to death 
many palestinians have absorbed the message before dec 8 when 
the uprising began 105000 palestinians from the occupied lands 
worked in israel most of them commuting to their jobs each day 
today the figure has dropped to 85000 and many of those still 
working in israel are worried and angry 
i was frightened when i heard about the three workers who were 
burned to death 25yearold issam ismail an aluminium factory 
worker from bethlehem told the associated press i was picturing 
myself in their place which is very possible these days 
wael yahyah nafeh 27 from the kalandia refugee camp said 
palestinian workers have always faced problems in israel 
its nothing new to me said nafeh who has worked for the 
israeliowned sonol gas company for the past six years we have 
been threatened since we were born only nowadays they dont do 
you the honor of threatening but kill or beat you straight away 
legislator amnon linn an arab affairs expert in the 
leftleaning labor party denied jewish violence against arabs was 
widespread 
they are marginal groups on the fringes of israeli society 
linn said of the jewish assailants 
but he warned the situation could deteriorate because of 
incidents like saturdays grenade attack in haifa 
if there is more of the same more wounded and if it should 
emerge that an arab from haifa was involved it will lead to 
tensions and it will be hard to predict what might happen said 
linn 
haifas population of 243000 includes 20000 arabs who hold 
israeli citizenship in contrast with other areas of israel many 
live in mixed neighborhoods with jews 
maryan meir the father of two young boys seriously wounded in 
the haifa blast denounced violence from either side 
i dont know who threw it jews or arabs but whoever threw it 
is below any level of humanity because whether theres a political 
problem or not he directed the grenade and i saw this toward my 
children meir told israel army radio 
most of the violence in israel so far has involved jews and 
palestinians from the lands seized from egypt and jordan in 1967 
but officials fear it could spread to israels 735000 arab 
citizens 
i hope the jewish sector realizes the grenade attack was 
carried out by three or four people not an entire community 
said alexander bligh deputy adviser to prime minister yitzhak 
shamir on arab affairs however we are concerned about the 
possibility of further acts of violence by jews against arabs

the palestinian guerrilla group led by abu 
nidal today claimed responsibility for a grenade attack that 
injured 25 people in the israeli port city of haifa 
also today the army said a palestinian died of wounds sustained 
in an overnight clash with israeli troops that left four other 
palestinians wounded arab reports said palestinians stayed off the 
job for a second day to protest israeli tax raids 
in the northern city of haifa police on sunday announced the 
arrest of four west bank palestinians suspected of hurling a 
grenade at a crowded sidewalk cafe saturday night twentyfive 
people were wounded 
the palestinian guerrilla group led by abu nidal claimed 
responsibility for the attack the claim came in a statement from 
his fatahrevolutionary council faction published in the beirut 
independent newspaper annahar 
the statement dedicated the attack to khalil wazir also known 
as abu jihad the military commander of the palestine liberation 
organization who was assassinated in a suburb of tunis in april 
israeli officials have privately acknowledged killing wazir 
dan meir 8 was the most seriously injured in the grenade 
attack both his feet were amputated and he suffered head wounds 
officials at al ittihad hospital in nablus identified the 
palestinian who died in the overnight clash as ahmad sharnobi 22 
of askar refugee camp they also said three were injured 
he was the third palestinian fatality since sunday and the 252nd 
in violence since dec 8 when palestinian revolted against two 
decades years of israeli occupation in the west bank and gaza 
strip four israelis have been killed 
a military spokesman said violence erupted after security forces 
entered the askar camp for initiated operations aimed at 
preventing riots during the strike the spokesman refused to 
elaborate 
arab news reports said the injuries came when plainclothes 
security agents opened fire after activists warned palestinians 
through loudspeakers that israelis were in the camp 
after the incident soldiers imposed a curfew on askar two 
neighboring refugee camps and the city of nablus the army said 
the restrictions confined about 140000 people to their homes 
the palestinian general strike was called in leaflets issued 
earlier this month by the underground united national leadership of 
the uprising 
it shut down public transportation and shops in israeliannexed 
arab east jerusalem and major cities in the occupied territories 
including nablus ramallah hebron and bethlehem arab news reports

on the hebronjerusalem highway and stoned dozens of arab cars 
carrying workers to jobs in israel forcing them to turn back 
associated press reporter haitham hamad saw 14 cars with windows 
smashed stopped along the highway near the dheishe refugee camp 
leaflets said the strike was to protest israels confiscation of 
the property or restriction of movement of arabs who refused to pay 
taxes 
tax boycotts have been a main element of the palestinian revolt 
against israeli rule 
israel has deported 33 palestinians since the beginning of the 
uprising and an army spokesman said recently that about 5500 arabs 
have been jailed many without trial under administrative detention

pubs and bars throughout england and wales will be 
allowed to stay open through the afternoon starting today ending a 
73yearold policy and arousing some fears of increased drunkenness 
and violence 
pubs clubs and hotel bars may now stay open on weekdays from 11 
am to 11 pm instead of closing between 3 pm and 530 pm 
sunday afternoon hours have been extended by one hour from noon 
until 3 pm 
in 1915 the government decreed the afternoon closing to curb 
drinking by munitions workers parliament voted overwhelmingly in 
april to do away with the old rules 
but pubs do not have to change their hours if they do not want 
to and the national licensed victuallers association predicted 
that almost half the 67000 pubs in england and wales would stick 
to the old ways 
most backstreet and country pubs will probably continue to call 
time on weekdays at 3 pm 
the brewers society predicted at least 25000 new jobs would be 
generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back 
lost trade from hamburger and pizza bars 
pub owners and brewers agree that pubs in seaside and tourist 
towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade 
home secretary douglas hurd said i believe that the new 
licensing hours will benefit society as a whole by giving people 
greater freedom of choice most people drink sensibly and 
responsibly and it makes no sense to deny them the opportunity to 
enjoy a drink in the afternoon at the time they wish 
the government has faced stiff opposition from the health lobby 
and critics who fear that drinkrelated crime particularly drunken 
violence by young rowdies and drunk driving will increase 
but champions of the new hours point out that extended hours in 
scotland introduced over a decade ago were followed by a reduced 
incidence of drunkenness and violence the scottish office said 
licensing changes had little impact on alcohol abuse 
in northern ireland most pubs increased alcohol sales during the 
past year in which pubs were allowed to open on sundays for the 
first time and open until later on weekdays

the government today banned a 
nationwide organization opposed to conscription laws requiring 
white men to serve in the armed forces 
law and order minister adriaan vlok acting under 
stateofemergency regulations said the end conscription campaign 
was banned from carrying out any activities 
action against the organization was expected since 143 young 
white men in the broadest challenge ever of the conscription 
system announced aug 3 that they would refuse to perform 
mandatory military service most of the men face sixyear jail 
terms 
leaders of the end conscription campaign denied involvement in 
organizing the mass resistance but defense minister magnus malan 
said he held the group responsible for the subversive action 
the organization appealed unsuccessfully for a system of 
alternative nonmilitary service for men politically or morally 
opposed to joining the army 
it has argued that no one should be forced to serve 
involuntarily in the army units that patrol black townships or in 
the forces combating proindependence guerrillas in southwest 
africa also known as namibia 
vlok in a statement said the end conscription campaigns 
primary purpose was to undermine public support for the armed 
forces 
the ecc attempts to create an impression of political 
neutrality vlok said but it is not difficult to see the 
organizations role in the revolutionary onslaught against south 
africa 
the end conscription campaign was formed in 1983 and many of 
its members were detained or restricted since a national state of 
emergency was declared in june 1986 
in february the organization said it suspected army involvement 
in a harassment campaign that included anonymous telephone calls 
smear pamphlets and vandalism of members property 
south africas conscription laws allow conscientious objection 
only for religious reasons not on political or moral grounds only 
whites are subject to conscription military service for other 
races is voluntary 
vlok said the end conscription campaigns effort had been 
endorsed by the african national congress the outlawed guerrilla 
group waging a sabotage and bombing campaign aimed at ending 
apartheid and overthrowing the south african government 
vlok also said the end conscription campaign had assisted draft 
dodgers helping them obtain residence permits to live in britain 
the government no longer disclosed how many men refuse to serve 
in the military in 1985 the last year figures were disclosed 
7589 men declined to serve 
the ban on the end conscription campaign is similar to bans 
imposed in february on 17 antiapartheid organizations under the 
bans the organizations are allowed to exist in name only 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

remeliik was shot to death outside his house three men were 
convicted of killing remeliik but were acquitted on appeal

475000 in 1983 and 1984 out of a 32 million loan made by british 
banks to palau for construction of a power plant 
salii acknowledged receiving 100000 from gordon mochrie 
managing director of international power systems co ltd ipseco 
of london but said the money was paid to a travel agency he owned 
to be used for a potential airline in palau the airline never came 
into being 
udall and de lugo wrote to rep dante fascell dfla chairman 
of the house foreign affairs committee charging that several 
senior palauan government officials have been connected to shipment 
of southeast asian heroin through palau they did not elaborate on 
those charges

international consortium of banks more than 44 million on 
defaulted loans for the ipseco power plant 
palau with a population of about 15000 has been administered 
by the united states as part of a farflung united nations 
strategic trusteeship since 1947 
palaus effort to negotiate an independent political 
relationship with the united states has been stymied by opponents 
of nuclear weapons palaus constitution bans nuclear weapons or 
power plants unless approved by 75 percent of the voters a 
proposed compact of free association which would permit us navy 
ships to call in palau has never received more than 73 percent 
approval

teenage aids victim ryan white sat at 
his kitchen table back in indiana with a couple of hollywood film 
makers eating pizza and reading a new movie script about his 
celebrated fight to return to school 
at one point ryan recalled director john herzfeld asked him to 
read the part of another young aids victim who had befriended him 
while they were in the hospital 
ryan didnt know it but he was auditioning for the role he got 
it 
hes a natural said linda otto coexecutive producer of 
the ryan white story an abc movie starring george c scott 
which is being filmed in statesville through sept 9 
to ryan his small role in the film reinforces the message that 
aids cannot be transmitted through casual contact it tells the 
story plus it helps educate people about aids and the hardships 
people go through he said in an interview friday 
ryan will appear as an older hemophiliac who like ryan 
contracted aids from a blood transfusion 
he didnt have a very positive outlook ryan said about his 
friend who died from the disease the film will not depict chads 
death 
the role of ryan is being played by lucas haas who starred 
opposite harrison ford in witness judith light of whos the 
boss stars as ryans mother jeanne scott plays the part of the 
familys attorney charles vaughn 
the softspoken ryan said it hasnt been difficult to work on a 
movie about his struggle with a deadly disease and the anguish his 
family went through in 1985 when residents of his native kokomo 
ind wanted to keep him from entering school 
its kind of weird seeing someone else playing my life he 
said with a smile friday at the iredell county courthouse where 
the court scenes depicting the whites legal battles were being 
filmed 
ryan is 16 now but looks younger because of his small size 
slouched back in his chair he looks like any other teenager with 
his untied hightop sneakers and closecropped haircut 
he is however far from typical 
he never feels sorry for himself ms otto said and he 
doesnt want anyone else to feel sorry for him ive learned so 
much from being around him 
the movie will describe some of the legal and other battles the 
family went through since ryan contracted aids in 1984 it follows 
his attempts to return to school a controversy that divided the 
residents of kokomo and forced the whites to eventually leave town 
the film ends with ryans first day of classes at hamilton 
heights high school in arcadia ind ryan was scheduled to fly back 
home to cicero early in the week so he can be ready for the start 
of school 
until then he will continue to hang around the set 
the crew is in love with him ms otto said 
while the movies focus is a young boy with a fatal disease it 
also is a testimony to his vigor and spirit 
this is not a story about a boy dying of aids ms otto 
said its the story of a boy living with aids and how a town was 
polarized by it its a microcosm of what it was like in this 
country three years ago and to some extent what its still like 
now 
this is not a movie about a familys tragedy she said 
its a family miracle im totally inspired by having known the 
whites

a new edition of upton sinclairs the 
jungle an expose of squalid conditions in the chicago 
stockyards will restore whole chapters cut to make the book more 
marketable a book historian says 
sinclair cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906 
doubleday page edition which caused meat sales to slump and 
spurred president theodore roosevelt to order an investigation that 
led to the nations first pure food and drug act 
gene degruson a professor and curator of rare books at 
pittsburg kan state university was quoted in todays new york 
times as saying that considering the material that was expunged 
from the original its amazing that the published book had any 
impact whatsoever 
despite his protestations that he wished the novel published 
as he had written it revision was drastic degruson wrote in the 
introduction to the new edition due in october from st lukes 
press of memphis tenn 
most of the deletions pertained to socialism but paragraphs 
criticizing the press and derogatory comments about big 
business selfmade men captains of industry and marriage also 
were deleted 
degruson said he pieced together the original novel from a 
truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who 
had been hired to clean out the cellar of a nearby farm the 
original novel had been serialized in a weekly newspaper the 
appeal but the special edition that contained the final eight 
chapters and the conclusion had been lost until degruson found it 
among the papers from the farm 
sinclair died in a bound brook nj nursing home in 1968 at 
the age of 90 one year after he returned to the white house to 
watch president johnson sign the wholesome meat act an expansion 
of the bill his book inspired

about 400 workers carrying polish flags 
and chanting solidarity seized control of the lenin shipyard 
today joining a wave of strikes that poses the most serious 
challenge to communist authorities since 1981 
the lenin shipyard became the 13th enterprise in a week to go on 
strike for higher pay and government recognition of solidarity the 
trade federation that was suppressed under martial law in 1981 
at least 10 coal mines in southern poland and transit and 
dockworkers in szczecin remained on strike on the seventh day of 
the labor unrest which has idled more than 76000 workers 
some gdansk port workers also were striking as of today 
according to reports from western journalists a solidarity 
spokesman jacek kuron said 3000 gdansk dockworkers were on 
strike 
aside from the shipyard which employs 10000 people no new 
strikes were confirmed by authorities today but there were many 
opposition reports of labor unrest nationwide 
activists in warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the 
14000worker ursus tractor plant outside the city a rally at the 
plant was dispersed by police during the morning shift resulting 
in three detentions said activist maciej jankowski but he said 
workers laid down tools in some departments 
a management spokesman at ursus who did not give his name 
confirmed an unsuccessful attempt to strike at the plant but made 
no mention of police and said work continued normally 
in southeastern poland solidarity organizer ewa kuberna said 
workers rallied at the 18000employee stalowa wola steel mill and 
heavy machinery plant and a strike was launched by 2000 of the 
workers 
government spokesman ryszard straus said people might be 
standing around at stalowa wola but it did not necessarily mean a 
strike 
opposition spokesman wojciech maziarski also reported new 
strikes or partial strikes at the cegielski turbine works in 
poznan the huta warszawa steel mill in warsaw and the railroad 
construction enterprise of szczecin 
a spokesman for huta warszawa mill technical director stanislaw 
zalesny said about 50 people tried to mount a strike but it 
failed straus said he had no information about any stoppages at 
cegielski or the szczecin railroad enterprise 
there was no police interference as workers marched around the 
gdansk shipyard carrying polish national flags and took over the 
main gate at 835 am late this morning however riot police 
cordoned off approaches to the shipyard 
strikers chanted solidarity slogans and posted strike banners on 
the shipyard fence helping some supporters who had been locked out 
to scramble over the gate 
a short time later solidarity national chairman lech walesa 
arrived 
we must fight for reforms we must fight for solidarity there 
is no other way walesa exhorted strikers in a 20minute rally at 
the gate 
everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike 
walesa said later by telephone from his gdansk home 
he said the enthusiasm of the young strikers surprised him 
this youth we have there is just incredible 
walesa blamed the strikes on authorities whom he said have 
refused to engage in dialogue with workers 
i wanted to avoid strikes he said we shouldnt be 
striking we should be working but there was no other choice 
we are still waiting for serious talks 
none of the shipyards towering cranes appeared to be operating 
and a foreman speaking through a fence stated that all departments 
were shut down 
workers could be seen strolling taking naps or perching on 
fences and walls around the yard straus confirmed that the 
government considered the shipyard on strike 
if you work only eight hours a day you make 40000 zlotys 
89 a month and thats not enough to make a living said one 
man in his mid20s asked why he joined the strike 
the shipyard where solidarity began eight years ago this month 
also was the scene of a strike in may that ended inconclusively in 
poland striking workers generally go to their plants but do not 
work 
not since the labor unrest that led to the 1981 military 
crackdown on solidarity have authorities had to confront strikes on 
such a scale wages are lagging far behind 60 percent inflation 
which is aggravated by average 40 price increases 
the governmentcontrolled media has called the strikes illegal 
and stressed their rising cost to the economy coal is polands 
leading export and a major source of hard currency to service its 
39 billion foreign debt 
the government which has refused to negotiate with solidarity 
has not stated how it intends to deal with the strikes 
solidarity only independent labor federation ever allowed in 
the soviet bloc was founded in the gdansk shipyard in 1980 after a 
nationwide strike wave it was outlawed in october 1982 
labor unrest stemming in part from government price increases 
have three times toppled governments in communist postwar poland 
in 1956 1970 and 1980

of rangoon diplomats and news reports said 
in the northern city of mandalay hundreds of thousands of 
people including housewives and children filled the streets in 
response to student calls for a nationwide protest and a general 
strike japans kyodo news service said

sein lwin was replaced by president maung maung the countrys 
first civilian leader in 26 years 
kyodo reported from rangoon that a group of protestors rallied 
in front of the us embassy saying we want our movement to be 
communicated to countries around the world 
the protesters are demanding an end to oneparty rule in burma 
in the southern city of victoria point near the thai border 
thousands of demonstrators marched to the town hall chanting 
slogans condemning oneparty rule a senior thai police official 
said 
rebels fighting the government threw their support behind the 
students 
the asian diplomat said the demonstrators gathered peacefully in 
downtown rangoon he said most shops in the capital were open in 
the morning despite student calls for a nationwide general strike 
but closed as the rally began

policies of rigid socialism strict military control and 
international isolationism 
security forces have not interferred with the demonstrations and 
after sein lwins departure authorities have indicated they will 
be much more tolerant of dissent

a couple who paid 100 for a stack of 
sealed boxes at a grab bag auction believes they have uncovered one 
of the most exciting finds in california art history 
jack and linda liberati who bought the crates on an impulse at 
a bekins van and storage co auction found they contained 70 
plasterofparis statues paintings sketches and other works by 
artist douglas tilden a sculptor who died in obscurity after 
capturing international acclaim at the turn of the century 
the couple who indicated they hope to sell the collection had 
no idea what was in the boxes when they bought them last spring at 
an auction 
i thought they were tool boxes liberati said sunday 
inside were casts of statues of historic figures including 
father junipero serra and dozens of diplomas and prizes all bearing 
the name douglas tilden 
the next day liberati went to the public library and discovered 
that tilden died broke and forgotten in his berkeley studio in 1935 
after winning international fame for his monumental public 
sculptures including the mechanics monument the admissions day 
monument and a heroic group honoring the spanishamerican war all 
statues along san franciscos market street 
they learned tilden was a deaf mute and according to one 
newspaper obituary the greatest and most tragic of california 
sculptors 
the liberatis say the 20 crates contain works found in tildens 
studio the day he died at the age of 75 
among the casts is a piece tilden never cast but had planned to 
call the bridge showing a young man and woman kneeling in an 
embrace across the waters of the san francisco bay 
when the bridge is finished tilden wrote i shall place 
this on telegraph hill to live with the bridge forever 
when monumental sculpture went out of style tilden never 
regained the acclaim he knew as a youth by 1930 he was destitute 
and died five years later in a studio where the electricity had 
been cut off

a soviet commentator today rejected suggestions 
that the kremlin or its afghan allies were responsible for the 
plane crash that killed pakistans president saying the united 
states was indirectly to blame 
yuri glukhov wrote in todays edition of the communist party 
daily pravda that president mohammad zia ulhaq had created 
dangerous conditions in his country through the assistance of the 
united states 
on pakistani territory are dozens of bases where inveterate 
terrorist cutthroats train glukhov wrote 
he did not say whether he thinks the united states was directly 
involved in wednesdays plane crash that killed zia and us 
ambassador arnold raphel he said an inquiry would have to be 
completed to determine whether sabotage was involved 
zia raphel and 28 others died when the c130 transport plane 
exploded after takeoff following a field inspection of new 
usbuilt battle tanks about 30 miles west of the indian border 
near the pakistani city of bahawalpur 
pakistan serves as a base for moslem guerrillas fighting the 
sovietbacked government of afghanistan the united states also 
backs the insurgents and glukhov alluded to this in a veiled 
accusation against the united states 
there are grounds to believe that the usa played a fatal 
role in zias fate it is the usa that prevented pakistan from 
getting out of a chronic crisis and achieving stability the 
commentator wrote 
he said without elaborating that us pressure had drawn 
pakistan into an undeclared war against afghanistan 
the new pakistani president ghulam ishaq khan has said the 
crash was an act of sabotage but declined to speculate on who might 
be responsible 
several pakistani newspapers published unsourced reports that 
officials believed the plane was hit by a missile others reported 
they suspected a bomb in the cockpit still others said explosives 
may have been concealed in a basket of mangos 
pravda quoted the times of london as saying in an editorial that 
if an investigation shows the crash resulted from a bomb explosion 
then afghan communists and their soviet allies should be suspected 
glukhov said such accusations reflect the incompetence of 
people trying to throw a shadow over afghan and soviet efforts 
to bring peace to the region

sen dan quayle rind said today that even 
though he was a mediocre proverbial c student in college his 
influential family didnt pull strings to get him admitted to law 
school 
theres been nothing that has been substantiated that any 
rules were violated that we did anything that was unfair quayle 
said responding to questions on abctvs good morning america 
about how he entered indiana university law school in 1970 and the 
national guard in 1969 
quayle the 41yearold republican vice presidential nominee 
made his comments the day after the plain dealer in cleveland 
reported that quayle had not met the admissions requirements for 
the law school but gained entrance after meeting with the 
admissions dean a republican judge in a city where quayles family 
owned the local newspaper 
the plain dealer said the meeting came after quayle had been 
rejected by the law school 
quayle acknowledged today that he was not a stellar student at 
depauw university from which he graduated in 1969 but he said he 
always wanted to attend law school 
my grades in college were not good he said i was your 
proverbial c student i wish i had been more serious in college i 
have to confess that 
in the same interview quayle rejected the notion that he tried 
to avoid the vietnam war by joining the national guard 
the point is that i was willing to serve i served in the 
national guard had my unit been called to vietnam like other 
units in indiana were called to vietnam i would have served and 
served with distinction i hope 
the issue of quayles service in the guard was raised sunday by 
sen bob dole rkan who had been in the running to serve as 
george bushs no 2 until bush picked quayle 
dole who lost the use of an arm as a result of a injury 
suffered in world war ii said that in his generation you knew 
who was in the guard and who was in uniform fighting for their 
country dole said that many people in his home state are very 
sensitive about it they didnt have anybody they could call they 
couldnt influence anyone 
on the issue of quayles entrance into night law school in the 
fall of 1970 the plain dealer said it confirmed in an interview 
with quayles father james c quayle that the school admitted 
quayle despite an academic record at depauw that fell below the law 
schools entrance requirements 
they werent going to accept him he didnt fit their 
criterion said the elder quayle publisher of the huntington 
ind heraldpress so danny went down there and talked to the 
dean he talked his way in danny hes a pretty good salesman 
in 1972 the admissions dean g kent frandsen conducted 
quayles marriage ceremony to marilyn tucker also a law student 
at her parents home 
frandsen was a republican city judge in lebanon ind where the 
quaylepulliam family owns the local newspaper frandsen also 
became quayles campaign manager in boone county in his 1986 senate 
race 
the schools admissions committee reviewed at least 1200 
applications in 1970 and offered admission to 450 students to fill 
275 openings frandsen said 
cleon h foust now retired dean of the law school called entry 
requirements strict undergraduate grades were about twice as 
important as scores on the national law school admissions test 
lsat he said 
foust recalls no pressure to admit quayle letters of 
recommendation written on quayles behalf are in school files 
which are not made public 
the law school required a minimum grade point average of 26 on

one zoohatched andean condor died in transit 
to a wilderness area but three others survived for an experiment 
intended to show the best way to reintroduce endangered california 
condors into the wild 
the surviving birds were safely placed in secret holding pens 
saturday in los padres national forest and more andean condors 
will be taken to the area in october said joe dowhan condor 
recovery coordinator for the us fish and wildlife service 
the dead bird was sent to san diego for an autopsy dowhan said 
he said its death will have little effect on the program in 
some ways you kind of want things to go wrong now instead of 
later he said 
the south american birds all females to prevent breeding in the 
wild are being used to test techniques biologists hope to use to 
begin returning the california condor to the wild after their 
numbers are increased in a captive breeding program 
only 28 california condors are known to survive all in 
captivity at the san diego wild animal park and the los angeles zoo 
the andean condor was chosen for the experiment because it is 
the closest living relative to the california condor though the 
andean condors are also endangered they number in the thousands 
scientists are conducting the experiment to see how birds 
hatched in captivity adapt to freedom and fend for themselves 
without native birds of their species to serve as examples 
the 3 and 4monthold birds will spend several weeks in mesh 
enclosures in the forest 75 miles northwest of los angeles 
when the andean birds are able to fly around november 
scientist will fit them with radio transmitters release them and 
monitor their progress 
the andean birds will remain in the wild until its time to 
release california condors perhaps as early as 1992 if the captive 
breeding program continues to succeed dowhan said

authorities in the tiny central african 
nation of burundi said today at least 5000 people were killed in 
ethnic clashes that sent 35000 people fleeing across the border 
theyve been able to get back into the hills and determine the 
extent of the massacre a senior western diplomat told the 
associated press in a telephone interview from burundis capital 
bujumbura 
he said burundis foreign minister cyprien mbonimpa issued the 
governments first official estimate of the number killed in last 
weeks massacre in a communique given to foreign diplomats at a 
morning briefing 
it indicated the governments latest body count the number of 
those killed now is about 5000 said the diplomat who spoke on 
condition he not be further identified 
mbonimpa described as highly exaggerated a media report that 
at least 24000 people had been killed in the fighting that began 
aug 14 between the hutu burundis majority tribe and the tutsi 
the minority tribe that controls the military and rules the 
country the diplomat said 
from every report including those from nongovernmental 
sources no one believes that figure he said 
staterun radio kigali today said 35000 people escaped the 
fighting by fleeing to burundis northern neighbor rwanda 
the radio monitored in nairobi said burundi officials on 
sunday met rwandan officials at rwandas southern border town of 
butare where the refugees are gathered 
it gave no details of the discussions but said the rwandan 
officials promised the burundi officials they would not allow 
anyone to use their territory to stage attacks on burundi 
burundi has claimed last weeks violence was caused by 
expatriate hutus who infiltrated northern burundi from foreign 
countries and incited the resident hutu population to massacre the 
tutsis 
peace was restored to the area within a day after the army moved 
in the government has said 
the hutu and the tutsi are longtime enemies following an 
abortive coup attempt in 1972 in burundi a former belgium colony 
the tutsi massacred 100000 to 300000 hutu including most of the 
tribes intelligentsia 
burundi has said most of last weeks victims were tutsi but an 
exiled opposition group the hutu people liberation party accused 
the tutsidominated military of massacring hutus a diplomatic 
source said there was no evidence of this 
hutu account for more than 90 percent of the population in the 
northern area around two communes known as marangara and ntega 
where most of the killings occurred burundi is mostly rural and 
people reside in such communes 
burundi and rwanda are among the worlds most densely populated 
nations and rwandan officials said its resources were being 
strained by the large influx of refugees 
nearly 5 million people live in burundi which is about the size 
of the state of maryland eightyfour percent of its people are 
hutu with the remainder tutsi the same percentages apply to the 6 
million people in rwanda which is slightly smaller in size than 
burundi 
burundis official communique promised to work with and try to 
assist the refugees to fled to rwanda to try to return them to 
their homes as soon as possible according to the western 
diplomat 
the communique said the government had the situation under 
control and that the military the ruling union of national 
progress party and the bureaucracy had been ordered to show 
restraint the diplomat said 
it said the policy of the government was one of respect for 
human rights and of ethnic reconciliation he said 
there is a 7 pm to 5 am curfew throughout burundi a ban on 
meetings of more than five people and restriction on travel between 
towns

a british arctic expert says that robert peary 
credited with being the first explorer to reach the north pole may 
actually have missed the top of the world by 30 to 60 miles the 
new york times reported today 
essential data is missing from pearys records and pearys own 
behavior after returning from a dash to the pole indicates he may 
have known he missed his objective according to wally herbert a 
polar explorer whose conjecture in the september issue of national 
geographic magazine was summarized by the times 
pearys diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition held 
in the national archives in washington were opened to scholars 
recently 
herbert said his doubts were based on possible navigational 
errors extraordinary distance claims and blank pages or 
insufficient data in pearys diary 
the diary entry for april 6 1909 the day peary is supposed to 
have reached the pole made no mention of it but a loose page was 
inserted that proclaimed the pole at last herbert said 
he said that after returning to camp peary showed no desire to 
celebrate and turned away with both hands covering his eyes when 
his associate matthew henson went to shake his hand 
pearys account contained no detailed record of wind speed 
weather and ice conditions or systematic position checks from sun 
and planet observations herbert said 
in addition to pearys failing to correct for ice drift and 
other possible errors his chronometer critical in navigation 
was 10 minutes fast an error he was not aware of while on the 
ice herbert said 
this alone could have put him west of the pole by 18 miles 
he said 
he said no explorers since even with snowmobiles have matched 
pearys claimed speed over polar pack peary said he made the round 
trip from base camp to pole 296 miles in eight days with 198 
miles covered in four days 
other specialists in polar history expressed little surprise at 
herberts assertions the experts also seemed resigned to the 
inconclusiveness of the issue 
im not sure we are ever going to know if he actually made it 
to the pole said mary lynne bird executive director of the 
american geographical society in new york

a federal jurys order that the hunt brothers pay 
more than 130 million to a peruvian company for their scheme to 
corner the world silver market marks another setback in the 
fortunes of the flamoyant dallas family 
however saturdays jury decision in new york will have little 
effect on the hunts efforts to settle a 15 billion dispute with 
their lenders a hunt bankruptcy attorney said 
besides the legal judgment the collapse of silver sugar and 
real estate investments have all contributed to the steady decline 
of the family fortune once estimated at 20 billion 
the jury said the three hunt brothers conspired to artificially 
raise the price of silver in the late 1970s to the detriment of 
minpeco sa the mining marketing company of the peruvian 
government 
bunker hunt 62 and herbert hunt 59 also were found to have 
engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity to monopolize the 
silver market the case is a civil action so no criminal penalties 
are attached to the finding 
minpeco had said lamar hunt 56 owner of the national football 
leagues kansas city chiefs and his two brothers conspired 
unsuccessfully with several middle east businessmen to corner the 
silver market 
but an attorney in the twoyear dispute with lenders said the 
damages awarded in the silver battle were relatively small 
i feel like the hunts won henry simon the bankruptcy 
attorney representing placid oil co which is owned by the trust 
estate of the hunt brothers told the dallas times herald 
the 130 million damages could be reduced by the 334 million 
amount minpeco earned on silver it held during the period simon 
said and 647 million which minpeco received from other 
defendants in a pretrial settlement could also be deducted from 
the amount the hunts must pay he said 
the hunts will file motions that raise other issues in the 
silver case said tom whitaker hunt energy corp vice president 
the brothers are confident that this wrong result will 
eventually be overturned as they proceed through the court 
system whitaker said saturday 
at first the hunts sons of the late texas oilman hl hunt 
took their losses with aplomb in march 1980 when the silver 
market crashed bunker hunt said a billion dollars just aint 
what it used to be 
in 1986 the brothers were all on the fortune 400 list of the 
richest americans with combined estimated assets of 1 billion 
last year they dropped off the list 
this year when forced to sell his seven kentucky farms and 
600horse stable of thoroughbred race horses the eldest hunt 
didnt attend the auction 
it would be too sad to watch he said 
the hunts sued their banks and lenders in july 1986 after they 
could not renegotiate loans for their placid oil co and penrod 
drilling co 
the two companies had failed to make payments on a total of 15 
billion in loans 
to settle the dispute the hunts proposed this spring to pay 
6635 million from funds raised through placid operations 
primarily in the north sea hearings on the bankruptcy settlement 
proposal were scheduled to begin this month

dana hasnt existed for a halfcentury 
except in the hearts of its former residents 
but for five hours sunday there was a homecoming for the 
survivors and children of the 500 people who once lived in the 
town first settled in 1763 but erased 50 years ago so boston could 
have drinking water 
four little central massachusetts towns died on april 27 1938 
on order of the state legislature to form the 38squaremile 
quabbin reservoir after the us supreme court rejected their 
appeals 
three enfield prescott and greenwich now lie under 413 
billion gallons of water only the dana common surrounded by empty 
cellars on high ground on the east side of the swift river valley 
escaped the inundation 
its the one place left where people can touch what was 
formerly there everything else is under water said terry 
campbell who runs weekly teas for former residents many now in 
the 70s and 80s 
gov michael s dukakis declared 1988 a year of remembrance for 
the 2500 people who lost their homes to the reservoir many of 
those who moved away have returned this spring and summer to attend 
events sponsored by local historical societies 
i was just 10 years old when we had to go it was hard said 
florence avery i remember them digging up the bodies in the 
cemetery and my grandfathers house 
mrs avery her five brothers and one of her five sisters as 
well as her 90yearold mother jennie belle cooley visited the 
site of their former home beside the deserted common 
theres still a lot of heavy sentiment thats passed on from 
generation to generation said robert boutelle past president of 
the petersham historical society and sundays master of ceremonies 
it was like the people who lost their homes were put on a ship 
and removed from the united states

rescuers searched through debris today 
for victims of an earthquake that ravaged onethird of this 
countrys territory and parts of india killing at least 650 people 
and injuring thousands 
the death toll was expected to climb from sundays predawn 
quake on the indianepal border which triggered landslides and 
floods and was the mountainous regions deadliest in 38 years 
officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports 
from the remote himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor which 
knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at 
least 3000 people 
niranjan thapa nepals minister of state for home affairs told 
a news conference at least 450 were dead and up to 1000 injured 
he said officials expected the numbers to climb 
indian officials reported at least 200 people dead and more than 
2000 injured most by debris from collapsing buildings 
the quake centered almost on the indianepal border registered 
65 on the richter scale 
indian television today showed the devastation in the indian 
state of bihar crumbled buildings makeshift morgues lined with 
rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds damaged hospital wards 
packed with survivors 
medical teams in india carried medicine and other supplies to 
overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for 
victims 
but the monsoons which hit the subcontinent in late june and 
usually last through september hampered relief operations 
nepals thapa told a news conference that the rains have been 
a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works access to some 
areas of this mountain country is impossible 
he said 21 of the kingdoms 75 districts suffered extensive 
damage the hardest hit appeared to be dharan a sparsely populated 
border region where thapa said at least 131 people died 
bir bahadur shahi secretary of the home affairs ministry flew 
to eastern nepal on sunday he said 50000 to 60000 houses were 
destroyed in the dharan district alone 
ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked shahi 
said adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone 
and older houses from mud and bricks wooden houses were not 
affected he said 
many people were given shelter in schools guesthouses and 
public buildings but most of the people do not want to leave 
their homes shahi said he said water supplies were still 
adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out 
prime minister rajiv gandhi flew to bihar to tour some of the 
hardest hit areas the government said it would release a detailed 
report after he returned to the capital tonight 
prime minister marich man singh shrestha of nepal visited some 
of the victims at bir hospital in his capital katmandu 
the quake roused people from their sleep in bihar and nine other 
indian states and central and eastern nepal it lasted about a 
minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour 
rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising 
rivers cracked paralyzing train service and road travel in many 
parts of the devastated areas 
parts of northern bangladesh and the capital dhaka also felt 
the tremor there were reports that 50 people were injured most by 
jumping from their houses during the quake 
witnesses in darbhanga an indian city of 800000 about 45 miles 
south of the epicenter said the only warnings were hissing sounds 
rattling doors and cracking windows women began blowing conch 
shells following an ancient tradition believed to appease the 
weather gods 
more than 25000 houses were flattened in darbhanga as well as 
the districts of munger and madhubani indian officials said 
in madhubani the bhootahi balan river jumped its banks and 
flooded nearly 50 villages officials said at least 45 people died 
but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or 
collapsing houses 
it was the worst quake to strike the region in 38 years a 
temblor rumbled through the indian state of assam on the 
indiachina border in august 1950 official accounts said more than 
1500 people died but seismologists said their records showed 
30000 were killed 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
every increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times 
greater a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in 
populated areas

a book describing lyndon b johnson as a fearful 
even paranoid president was criticized today by a former johnson 
press secretary as the work of someone who barely knew the former 
president 
former secretary of state dean rusk meanwhile disputed one 
incident described in the book 
in a soontobepublished book entitled remembering america 
a voice from the sixties former johnson speechwriter richard 
goodwin describes johnson as intensely fearful of his political 
rivals and prone to lapse into irrational ramblings about them 
i am very very uneasy about diagnoses of paranoia even when 
theyre made by an expert and goodwins not an expert said 
former press secretary george reedy goodwin really only knew him 
for a year or so and didnt really know him too well for that 
year 
johnson frequently would blow off steam reedy said and 
white house aides understood that they should ignore some of the 
wild directives he would issue during these episodes reedy said 
in addition he said johnson was highly manipulative and may have 
intended to shock goodwin whom he knew to be a friend of robert f 
kennedy 
i dont think he has enough background to put it in the right 
perspective reedy said of goodwin 
rusk in a telephone interview today said i pay no attention 
whatever to talk like that from richard goodwin i consider it 
irresponsible and untrue 
the book quotes johnson referring to blacks as niggers 
calling top foreign service officials as those damn kennedy 
ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me and accusing 
liberals and top newspaper columnists of being communists johnson 
is also portrayed as obsessed with robert kennedy whom he accused 
of plotting against him 
an advance chapter of the book provided to the associated press 
focused on johnsons behavior in 1965 a year when he was at the 
height of his political power johnson was planning the first 
fullscale commitment of american troops to vietnam while in 
congress he was pushing landmark legislation on poverty and civil 
rights 
in april 1965 goodwin wrote johnson canceled a scheduled visit 
by the leaders of pakistan and india after the two expressed 
opposition to the vietnam war goodwin described a heated 
conversation between johnson and rusk after the us ambassadors to 
those countries suggested johnson send vice president hubert 
humphrey to south asia to ease any hurt feelings 
johnson read them then his face contorted in fury rose and 
slammed them onto his desk i dont want telegrams like that he 
almost shouted then picked up the phone get me rusk listen 
mr secretary he began softly sardonic you know those 
telegrams about humphrey the president suddenly raised his 
voice if they send me any more telegrams like that i want you to 
call them back fire the bunch of them 
johnson hung up and said to his aides its those damn kennedy 
ambassadors trying to get me and discredit me goodwin said he 
was told by a white house correspondent that johnson had referred 
to the snubbed leaders as those two niggers 
rusk said today no such phone call took place and i dont 
remember the cancellation of those two visits 
goodwin although not a trained psychologist argued that 
johnson exhibited paranoid behavior the conclusion is based on 
goodwins observations as well as discussions about johnson the 
author had at the time with a psychiatrist 
lyndon johnson had become a very dangerous man wrote 
goodwin a resident of concord mass there is no question in my 
mind that both the atmosphere of the white house and the decisions 
taken until 1965 the only period i personally observed were 
affected by the periodic disruptions of lyndon johnsons mind and 
spirit 
goodwin was an aide to president john f kennedy and later was 
the senior speech writer for johnson goodwin left the johnson 
administration in 1965 and later became an opponent of the vietnam 
war

prime minister margaret thatcher today refused to 
rule out detention without trial for guerrilla suspects saying she 
wanted to keep the ira guessing following the killing of eight 
british soldiers 
you do not tell your enemies precisely what it is you are 
going to do ever she said we are having a thorough 
security review of all matters and nothing has been ruled out 
her comments appeared to contradict the times of london which 
quoted unidentified government sources saying she had rejected 
calls by protestant leaders in northern ireland for the internment 
of 60 to 80 known irish republican army guerrillas 
internment without trial was introduced in northern ireland on 
aug 9 1971 by the government of conservative prime minister 
edward heath following worldwide criticism it was abandoned by 
the government of labor prime minister harold wilson in december 
1975 
speaking to reporters after opening a hospital in the southwest 
england port of plymouth mrs thatcher branded the ira bus bombing 
an assassination she vowed we must never let the terrorists 
win 
official unionist lawmaker ken maginnes one of the lawmakers 
who wants internment brought back confirmed today that he gave 
mrs thatcher the names of three ira men he claimed were involved 
in friday nights bombing 
the attack killed eight and wounded 27 young members of the 
first battalion of the light infantry who were just coming off 
furlough in mainland britain the ira claimed responsibility 
immediately afterward 
it was the deadliest ira attack since 1982 and brought the 
number of military deaths in a summer blitz to 26 
northern ireland secretary tom king the cabinet member 
responsible for the province visited some of the injured and 
promised a relentless campaign against the men of evil 
he said the government and the army would take whatever steps 
were necessary to defend what is good and what is right in 
northern ireland 
however the british broadcasting corp said king is convinced 
reintroduction of internment would be counterproductive king met 
with security chiefs in northern ireland today 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland it wants to unite the predominantly protestant 
province with the overwhelmingly catholic irish republic 
heath said in a bbc radio interview sunday that his government 
quickly realized after the introduction of internment in 1971 that 
the policy had been a major mistake 
he said the people who were interned really bore very little 
resemblance to those who were out to cause damage the way in which 
they were arrested caused reaction throughout the united 
states and the rest of the world which was very damaging to us 
thirdly it gave the ira a means of recruiting from amongst 
people who were interned he said 
critics of internment said many of the hundreds of people 
rounded up were innocent they also said many of the internees were 
brutally treated and that the policy discriminated against roman 
catholics 
in 1978 the european court of human rights ruled that britain 
had been guilty of inhuman and degrading treatment in a case 
brought by 12 former internees subjected to indepth interrogation

more than four years after a widow with 
no children died and left about 135000 to the federal government 
to reduce the national debt the money is still in the bank drawing 
interest 
lawyers for three parties the deceased minnie vogel the 
federal government and the kentucky revenue cabinet only recently 
worked out an agreement to dispose of the estate 
the agreement capped a lengthy dispute over whether the state is 
entitled to claim inheritance tax from ms vogels estate under 
the agreement the state may claim its share about 30000 and 
the federal government gets the rest 
the agreement was recently approved by jefferson circuit judge 
edmund p karem now the parties are awaiting final approval from 
jefferson district probate court said assistant us attorney 
michael f spalding who is handling the case for the federal 
government 
when ms vogel of louisville died in may 1984 at age 85 she 
left about 35000 and some property to seven nieces and nephews 
the rest about 135000 i bequeath and devise to my beloved 
country the united states of america to be used to reduce the 
national debt the will stated 
efforts to settle the estate hit a snag soon after her death 
when the state tried to claim inheritance taxes from the money that 
was to go to the federal government the federal government agreed 
to pay the inheritance tax but vogels lawyer sued saying he did 
not think it was ms vogels intent that part of her money should 
go to the state 
although the federal government will still receive more than 
100000 if the compromise is approved david liebschutz a 
spokesman for the us bureau of public debt noted that it wont 
make a noticeable dent in the public debt now at 25 trillion

a streetpreaching 11yearold was suspended 
minutes after arriving for the first day of school today after he 
stuck a bible in the principals face and told him you go to 
hell school officials said 
i have trouble when a child says that to an authority 
figure said jim gorst principal of eastfield elementary school 
duffey strode 11 had taken only about 10 steps on school 
property before he confronted gorst said david strode the boys 
father who quoted his son as telling the principal youll go to 
hell 
school officials however captured the confrontation on 
videotape which confirms gorsts version said shirley ramsey 
eastfields assistant principal 
strode said he took all three of his preaching children home 
after duffeys suspension and did not know whether he would take 
them to school tuesday last year duffey was repeatedly suspended 
for shouting bible verses and preaching against whoremongers 
and fornicators 
the father said todays trouble began when a sheriffs deputy 
took the hand of pepper 7 who started screaming and duffey 
became enraged 
strode and his wife robin have been banned from school 
property and watched from beyond the gates 
family friends had planned to escort the children from the gate 
to the school building but officials instead ordered the deputies 
to take the children thats when pepper began screaming strode 
said 
gorst then asked strode to bring his children into the school 
strode said he refused and walked away with the three children at 
that point gorst asked him to bring the younger children back 
saying only duffey was suspended strode said 
they just dont want duffey at school period strode said 
duffey was suspended for 10 days for disruptive and 
disrespectful behavior ms ramsey said and she warned that a 
longterm suspension that could last the entire school year can 
be enacted at any point 
school officials have simply said at this point that they will 
not have this continue for the year she said 
duffey and his brother matthew 6 were preaching on their way 
to the school grounds strode said pepper who did not preach last 
year yelled repent a couple of times he said 
earlier mcdowell county schools superintendent david ricketts 
said he and other school officials dreaded the first day of school 
because last year the strode children had preached about 
whoremongers and fornicators 
we cannot go through another year like we did last year he 
said 
ricketts on friday notified mrs strode and her husband david 
in a registered letter that they were barred from the school 
grounds he warned them that appropriate action would be taken 
if they came onto school property 
the trouble began last spring when duffey a fifthgrade a 
student came to school one morning in march and stood near the 
back entrance shouting bible verses 
when teachers and students passed duffey shouted verses about 
whoremongers and fornicators when the principal asked duffey to 
come inside the school he refused 
soon after kindergartener matthew did the same thing 
firstgrader pepper accompanied matthew but did not preach mrs 
strode said pepper would join her brothers in quoting scriptures 
this year 
ricketts and ms ramsey say theyre concerned about the strode 
childrens effect on other children at the school especially 
kindergarten students who on their first day of school will be 
confronted by yelling children and parents 
theyre urging parents to stay calm 
were hoping the citizens of the county will be understanding 
and realize we are doing everything we can as fast as we can 
ricketts said

the soviet union is cutting back on awarding 
medals criticizing the number of honors handed out during the 
brezhnev era and adopting rules to ensure they are given to workers 
who deserve them 
under the late leader leonid i brezhnev awards were given out 
by the scores and even by hundreds to people who had fulfilled 
the governments fiveyear production plans the official news 
agency tass said monday 
people have stopped appreciating awards because they were 
given out with a bountiful hand in the brezhnev period on the 
occasion of birthdays and redletter dates tass said 
the real contribution of the person awarded was not duly taken 
into account tass said 
the communist partys policymaking central committee and 
presidium of the supreme soviet the nominal parliament has 
adopted new rules on medals to make sure they are given to people 
who truly deserve them the news agency said 
the image of brezhnev himself is one of a man with a full chest 
of medals and the soviet press has recently lampooned him for this 
the overhaul of the award system is another element of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs drive to hold public officials more 
accountable for their work and to end blind praise for them it 
also is another step in moving away from the policies of brezhnev 
now condemned widely for plaguing the country with cronyism 
corruption and economic stagnation 
to improve the system decisions on recipients wont be made by 
a small number of highranking officials in private but by all 
work collectives and public organizations the news agency said 
awards will no longer be made en masse or for reaching a jubilee 
in a citizens career 
the countrys highest honors including the title hero of the 
soviet union and hero of socialist labor wont be given more than 
once to the same person as has happened in the past eligibility 
requirements have been tightened for the top decorations the order 
of lenin and order of the october revolution tass said without 
elaborating 
but while many of the changes appear aimed cutting the number of 
awards given tass said new honorary titles were being created for 
teachers physicians and agricultural workers gorbachevs 
administration has placed particular emphasis on improving these 
professions 
the article gave no figures for the number of awards given in 
the past or what the number will be under the new rules

the government on monday 
withdrew a widely criticized bill that would force the evictions of 
tens of thousands of blacks living in areas designated for whites 
critics said the bill which would require magistrates to evict 
anyone living in a neighborhood reserved by law for another race 
would provoke international outrage 
chris heunis minister of constitutional development and 
planning said the measure would be reintroduced in parliament 
with amendments specifying that evictions not be mandatory 
the amended bill however would retain other provisions 
strengthening enforcement of residential segregation leaders of 
the parliaments asian and mixedrace chambers which cannot block 
most governmentbacked bills said their houses would adjourn 
indefinitely to protest the new legislation 
heunis said the amended bill would allow government officials to 
consider the availability of alternative housing and other 
humanitarian considerations before approving evictions in 
other ways he said it would remain identical to the original 
measure 
among the controversial measures remaining in the bill are those 
making it easier for authorities to confiscate property and to 
evict and prosecute people violating the group areas act the 
35yearold act designates racially segregated neighborhoods 
under both the new and old versions of the bill the maximum 
fine for property owners who allow a person to live outside his 
racial area would increase from about 165 to 4100 the maximum 
prison sentence would increase from two years to five years 
the act is a major issue in the campaign for nationwide 
municipal elections oct 26 the governments proposal to 
strengthen enforcement of the act has been seen as an accommodation 
to rightwing whites 
the government has not strictly enforced the group areas act in 
recent years angering conservative whites opposed to integrated 
neighborhoods 
president pw botha said last week he believes residential 
segregation is favored by 80 percent of whites 70 percent of 
asians and people of mixed race and a majority of blacks 
alan hendrickse leader of the mixedrace chamber of parliament 
challenged bothas claim saying his constituents favored total 
repeal of the act 
south africas black majority is excluded from parliament but 
both the mixedrace and asian chambers are expected to reject the 
group areas legislation and its amendments 
this would force the government to refer the bill to the 
presidents council a body controlled by bothas national party 
the party has the power to implement legislation over the 
opposition of the two nonwhite chambers 
parliament which reconvened monday after a midyear recess also 
is to debate legislation on creating the first open areas or 
legal multiracial neighborhoods botha would have veto power over 
any such plans

its been 14 years since the kitchen 
closed at the olivero cafe but minnie olivero still entertains 
friends there and tidies up the counter she toiled behind for more 
than 40 years 
although you cant buy a meal at the diner or pay 10 cents for 
a slice of homemade pie the olivero cafe remains open to old 
friends and to strangers curious about times past 
this place is a museum and i am too laughed mrs olivero 
who will be 82 on tuesday i guess im an antique like most of 
the things in here 
the tiny cafe is a classic 1930sera diner and soda fountain 
that seated about 25 people at its five tables and stools 
for 40 years five months and three days minnie served 
sandwiches coffee her special chili homemade pie and ice cream 
to hungry truk drivers coal miners motorists farmers and 
residents of this town of 800 located about 30 miles south of 
peoria 
the cafe was open seven days a week often 12 hours a day and 
every holiday through the great depression world war ii and the 
postwar boom 
louis always used to say wed close when the last nickel goes 
by the window she said it was a part of our lives and we both 
enjoyed it its not because we were more dedicated than anyone 
else or a different cut of people 
minnie dropped out of school in sixth grade to work in her 
parents general store in panama ill in 1919 she married louis 
a coal miner in 1924 
the couple was flat broke three times early in their marriage 
mrs olivero said in 1933 louis borrowed 100 from his wifes 
family to buy a cafe on old route 29 in green valley 
when louis told me he bought the cafe i told him to go run it 
by himself because i didnt like to cook she said 
but cook she did earning a reputation for her homemade 
chocolate syrup and soda fountain syrups she also cleaned 
collected telephone bill payments sold tobacco candy greeting 
cards bus tickets and blew the community fire whistle every 
evening 
the old hard road was the main drag between springfield and 
peoria she said we had a lot of coaltruck drivers and they 
hauled straw from all around here up to quaker oats in peoria we 
had a good business 
in 1937 the oliveros moved their cafe to a new building on the 
corner where main street intersected the highway they lived behind 
the cafe and minnie cooked in the family kitchen 
their only child oliver ran the candy counter and helped out 
at the cafe until he left to fight in world war ii as a pilot in 
1945 he was killed over the adriatic sea and his body was never 
found 
after that louis quit working at the coal mine and we both 
worked at the cafe mrs olivero said the only reason we 
worked that hard was to build a nest egg for our son 
for the first time they closed the cafe to take vacation trips 
each summer the rest of the year however they remained open 
every day christmas included 
i enjoyed it and louis did too she said i think now how 
crazy we must have been but it was our life 
it still is minnies life her husband died shortly after they 
closed in 1974 and she has kept the cafe as a private museum ever 
since 
shiny milkshake glasses and various size coke glasses stand on 
the wall behind the soda fountain minnie still uses the antique 
cash register to hold her spare change and the ice box and 
refrigerator hold her groceries 
there are plates on the walls and hundreds of photos of 
relatives and friends in the cabinets that once held pies tobacco 
costume jewelry and other goods she still blows the fire whistle 
every night 
we had so many fond memories here thats why im glad i 
stayed she said

george bush emotionally defended embattled 
running mate dan quayle today telling a veterans organization 
quayle joined a national guard unit with vacancies and never went 
to vietnam because his unit was not called there 
its true he didnt go to vietnam because he wasnt called 
bush told the veterans of foreign wars convention but heres 
another truth he didnt go to canada and he didnt burn his draft 
card 
veterans in the audience gave bush a hearty ovation after the 
vice president departing from his prepared text said he believes 
quayle has been the vicim of shrill partisian attacks 
let his attackers cast the first stone bush said 
because i served in combat and because i saw some of my 
countrymen killed i salute the vietnam veterans today those who 
fought in the rice paddies he continued 
i hardly ever walk by the vietnam veterans memorial in 
washington when i dont get a lump in my throat or a tear in my 
eye but many others served too some in the army reserve some in 
the national guard people who were not sent overseas 
meanwhile quayle reasserted today that he broke no rules nor 
did anything unfair to get into the indiana national guard during 
the vietnam war 
appearing on two television talk shows quayle also said he did 
not think it was hypocritical for him to strongly back the war 
effort and opt to join the guard at the same time 
and he said he is convinced the furor will die down and cant 
wait for that to happen 
right now i just sit there and answer questions quayle 
said on abcs good morning america 
asked about the question of hypocrisy quayle said 
i dont think its hypocritical there were a lot of people 
that were in the national guard in my national guard unit that 
supported the goals of fighting communism in vietnam but were in 
the national guard 
on nbcs today show quayle said i dont even know what 
my draft lottery number was at the time he joined the guard 
quayle joined the guard in the summer of 1969 the lottery 
system of selecting people for the draft took effect dec 1 that 
year 
quayle posed for photographers in his senate office later in the 
day but brushed aside questions about his continuing status on the 
republican ticket saying only im george bushs running mate 
as reporters attempted to pepper him with more questions quayle 
said i was a journalist one time i used to tell people dont 
ever get into an argument with people who buy ink by the barrel 
then looking at the television cameras surrounding him he 
said im not going to even with cameras 
bush had said earlier he is confident quayle will surmount the 
flap over his national guard duty but that in the meantime ive 
got to take the heat 
bush said sunday that he remains upbeat about his election 
prospects despite questions about the extent to which family 
influence helped quayle avoid being drafted and got him into law 
school even though he didnt meet admission requirements 
democratic nominee michael dukakis is responding to the 
controversy by noting that the qualifications of his own vice 
presidential choice sen lloyd bentsen have not come under 
attack otherwise dukakis has kept to his own campaign themes and 
today was visiting northeastern massachusetts a region he often 
cites when discussing his record of economic development 
bush had a speech scheduled to a veterans of foreign wars 
convention in chicago 
bush was clearly unhappy sunday with the intense scrutiny of 
quayles background and with democratic criticism of his own 
decisionmaking he said hes sticking with quayle with no 
hesitancy but that the indiana senator needs time to get his 
act together before campaigning on his own 
bush who conducted joint appearances with quayle in the midwest 
over the weekend said quayle will begin campaigning alone as 
soon as he can get squared away with a staff and a schedule of 
appearances 
quayle stumbled during initial news conferences and interviews 
after being selected by bush last week and bush aides are spending 
the early portion of this week trying to prepare him for his first 
solo campaign appearances scheduled to begin wednesday 
throughout their appearances in indiana and ohio questions 
continued to be raised about the circumstances of quayles 
enlistment in the guard at the height of the vietnam war in 1969 
he was 22 then and described himself at the time as a supporter of 
the war 
quayle has said that before his student deferment from the draft 
expired he discussed with his family his desire to join the guard 
a former top newspaper employee of the family said he interceded 
with the guard on quayles behalf 
questions also are being raised about quayles law school 
admission the cleveland plain dealer reported sunday that quayle 
did not meet the academic requirements of indiana university law 
school but got in anyway after meeting with the admissions dean a 
republican judge in a city where quayles family owned the local 
newspaper 
the plain dealer quoted quayles father james c quayle as 
saying his son met with the dean after being initially rejected by 
the law school he talked his way in the elder quayle said 
bush dismissed questions about the law school admission by 
saying i dont see that theres an enormous demand from the 
public to learn this guys high school grades 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan appearing on nbctvs 
meet the press said bush campaign chairman james a baker iii 
had told him that he believed the military issue was pretty much 
behind them but dole said his own opinion is that its going 
to last awhile 
dukakis said over the weekend that people should notice how few 
have questioned the qualifications of bentsen to serve as vice 
president other democrats were quick to challenge bushs 
decisionmaking ability 
why did george bush pick daniel quayle thats got to be the 
question house democratic whip tony coelho dcalif said on 
cbstvs face the nation program his first presidential 
decision was dan quayle michael dukakis first presidential 
decision was lloyd bentsen 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich also on cbs said that 
if quayle is not qualified to be vice president at that point 
the real issue is not dan quayle its george bush and his 
judgment 
bush speaking with reporters on air force two said no thought 
had been given to asking quayle to withdraw that the 41yearold 
senator had not offered to step aside and he shouldnt 
i want him out campaigning bush said he will have a 
tremendous appeal to young people and hell help with that gender 
gap 
hes been thrown into a hornets nest but you know ive been 
there the vice president said ive got to take the heat i 
made the decision the buck stops right here i have no hesitancy 
about it

the united states has informed the soviet 
union and india that american support for pakistans security 
remains strong in the wake of the death of president mohammed zia 
ulhaq 
separate messages were sent to both moscow and new delhi after 
zias 11 years of rule ended in an air crash wednesday in which 
us ambassador arnold l raphel and brig gen herbert m wassom 
chief of the us military group in pakistan also perished 
the point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is 
unchanged and that we are going to stand by pakistan said a 
us official who spoke monday on condition of anonymity 
the tone of the messages and conversations here and in moscow 
with soviet diplomats was more pointed than in dealing with india 
said a second us official with the soviets it was more in 
terms of cautioning them about afghanistan said this official 
who also spoke anonymously 
so far the behavior is quite correct in each case a third 
us official said 
pakistan under zia was the closest us ally in central asia and 
the conduit for the shipment of american and chinese weapons to 
afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the afghan 
government and soviet troops 
while the state department has complimented caretaker president 
ghoulam ishaq khan about the steps he took after zias death 
including a decision to go ahead with national elections in 
november there is concern there could be prolonged instability in 
pakistan 
so far us officials said there is no indication that the 
soviets are slowing the pace of their troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan or seizing on the death of zia to raise tensions in the 
area 
their hostility to pakistan has not ended a us official 
told the associated press they havent backed off but there is 
no escalation i think they understand very clearly our position 
india which has gone to war several times with pakistan since 
the 1940s has strong military ties with the soviet union 
a funeral service for raphel was held monday at the fort myer 
chapel in arlington va the speakers included deputy secretary of 
state john c whitehead and veteran diplomat philip c habib

a third round of talks between delegates 
from north and south korea about peace and sharing the olympics 
broke down monday with no word on when the two rivals would meet 
again 
the 10 legislators five from each side ended the talks that 
began friday at this village inside the demilitarized zone 35 
miles north of the south korean capital of seoul without 
indicating there would be another meeting before the olympics 
one top south korean official said the talks probably would be 
suspended until after the sept 17oct 2 olympics in seoul 
the two koreas bitter neighbors since their land was divided at 
the end of world war ii refused to budge from their past positions 
and instead blamed each other for blocking progress 
the meeting at a north korean pavilion in the northern sector of 
this truce site ended after two hours when both sides said the 
talks were deadlocked south korean chief delegate park joonkyu 
proposed a private meeting with his communist counterpart to try to 
resolve the problem 
north koreas delegation withdrew to consider the proposal but 
did not respond by the set deadline and the south korean 
delegation returned to seoul 
park said he asked for the private meeting to see if north korea 
was sincere about making headway 
if there is no hope we will postpone the next meeting until 
after the olympics park said 
chon kum chol the chief north korean delegate said after the 
meeting that south koreas attitude is antiunification their 
direction and way of thinking is mistaken 
chon held out hope for another meeting but said it all 
depends on the southern side it is the south that should make 
concessions 
south korea called for urgent talks to be held in the north 
korean capital of pyongyang beginning aug 29 to focus solely on 
trying to resolve the issue of the olympics 
i must say the olympic issue is an urgent and important 
question and both sides agree that the question should be resolved 
before the end of august park said 
but chon in an opening statement before south korean made its 
proposal said separate talks on the olympics were unacceptable he 
said north korea wanted joint discussion of the olympics and the 
nonaggression issue 
north koreas official korean central news agency said the south 
korean offer on the olympics was contrary to the purpose of the 
talks 
the publication of a joint declaration on nonaggression and 
the 24th olympic games are important problems that should be solved 
together at an early date as they are aimed to remove the 
confrontation and tension misunderstanding and distrust between 
the north and the south the news agency said in a report 
monitored in tokyo 
still at issue was a north korean call for a joint meeting of 
nearly 1000 members of the two sides legislatures to discuss its 
bid to be a cohost of the olympics and draft a joint declaration 
on nonaggression 
north korea also said monday a formal nonaggression treaty was 
not necessary because it contends the two sides are not separate 
nations it called for both sides parliaments to issue a 
declaration of nonaggression which seeks a pullout of 42000 us 
troops stationed in south korea 
north korea says it will boycott the olympics if it is not 
allowed to be a cohost south korea fears north korea could use 
terrorism to disrupt the olympics 
previous sporadic talks between the two sides since the early 
1970s failed to make progress the last talks collapsed in january 
1986 when north korea pulled out to protest annual south 
koreanus military exercises 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by soviet and us 
forces that ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start the korean war 
which ended in stalemate in 1953 without a peace treaty being 
signed

vice president salvador laurel on 
monday declared his intention to lead the opposition against 
president corazon aquino after she rejected his call to resign 
laurel made his remarks during a news conference in which he 
likened mrs aquino to deposed president ferdinand marcos laurel 
objected to a statement mrs aquino made sunday in which she 
claimed to have a contract with god to lead the country until 
her term expires in 1992 
mrs aquino meanwhile asked the countrys provincial governors 
to block any coup attempts against her when she visits brunei next 
week for a threeday state visit 
laurel said mrs aquinos rejection of his demand to resign and 
call new elections which he issued aug 13 gave him no choice but 
to lead the opposition 
therefore as vice president i will devote my time to voicing 
out the grievances of our suffering people and lead all those who 
believe that this nation is entitled to a better government 
laurel said 
mrs aquino has chosen to ignore and evade the issues of 
incompetence corruption and lack of leadership that have 
characterized her administration he charged once again she 
regaled the people with promises which for the past 30 months she 
has consistently disregarded 
laurel called for new elections after accusing the aquino 
government of incompetence he said that if she resigned he would 
also resign if not he said he would remain vice president but 
dissociate himself from her government 
in a speech sunday mrs aquino accused unspecified enemies of 
the state of trying to destabilize her government she said she 
was determined to remain in office and produce economic progress 
nothing and no one shall deflect me from this task she 
said for my mandate is with this nation not with its enemies 
my covenant is with the constitution our contract is with god 
marcos had made a similar statement to justify his 20year rule 
of the philippines laurel said without elaborating 
mrs aquino met monday with 45 provincial governors during 
which she discussed efforts to curb corruption fight poverty and 
crush the 19year communist insurgency she also called on the 
governors to continue supporting her government during her visit to 
brunei which begins next monday 
i know that while i am away you will take care of things so 
that my enemies will not try to pull something again she said 
mrs aquinos government has survived at least five coup attempts 
in the last two years 
executive secretary catalino macaraig said monday the government 
was stable enough to allow marcos to return but would rather he 
stay away if it had its way he said the government was leaving the 
question of marcos return to the courts 
i think the president is confident that the government can 
cope with whatever events might be triggered by the return of 
president marcos macaraig said 
but he warned that opponents of marcos might try to kill him if 
he returns 
the military will have to give him protection he said 
there is really a problem because there are those who might try 
to do him harm and put the blame on the president 
the possibility of a marcos return from his hawaiian exile 
surfaced last week when the antigraft court ruled the ousted 
president had the right to be present during the court deposition 
of a former cabinet minister set for november 
philippines officials accuse marcos of stealing billions of 
dollars from the treasury during his presidency

drawing on royal precedent the duke and duchess 
of york have named their 2weekold daughter beatrice elizabeth 
mary buckingham palace said monday 
the princess names are from queen victorias youngest child 
the present queen and her mother and the dukes greatgrandmother 
queen mary 
the baby who is at the royal summer retreat in scotland with 
her parents prince andrew and sarah and the queen will be known 
as her royal highness the princess beatrice of york 
she is fifth in line to the throne and the first child for the 
duke and duchess of york 
the announcement of her name ended energetic speculation which 
long preceded her aug 8 birth one major bookmaker closed his 
books for a time when a newspaper quoted andrew as saying one day 
in may that the baby would be a girl named annabel 
but annabel continued to remain a favorite among bettors along 
with charlotte and victoria not a single bet was placed on 
beatrice at two of the countrys largest bookmakers they said with 
delight 
its terrific we couldnt have chosen a better name said 
graham sharp of william hill bookmakers which offered beatrice at 
100 to 1 odds we cleaned up every which way 
it is a bit of a surprise for everybody said malcolm palmer 
of coral bookmakers victoria and elizabeth were the two 
favorites 
the only correct entry in the public guessing game came from 
britains largestcirculation newspaper the tabloid sun which 
reported all three names friday 
the newspaper said annabel had been the first choice of andrew 
and sarah but the queen who must approve royal names rejected it 
as too yuppie and suggested beatrice 
the last princess beatrice among british royals was the youngest 
of queen victorias nine children 
the sun reported the name was royal enough for the queen but 
unusual enough to please sarah 
harold brooksbaker publisher of burkes peerage said sarah 
was pleased because she likes oldfashioned names 
the babys second name honors her grandmother the queen and 
her greatgrandmother queen mother elizabeth her third name 
mary is the name of the dukes greatgrandmother queen mary wife 
of king george v as well as the middle name of sarahs mother 
susan barrantes 
buckingham palace said no date had been announced for the 
christening 
prince andrew a royal navy lieutenant is due to return soon to 
his ship hms edinburgh in the far east following a leave of 
absence

an ohio horsebreeder who has never laid 
eyes on tougaloo university donates a sum to the school every time 
his mare of the same name wins a race 
no ive never been to the school said landon knight of 
akron but it just sounds like such a great institution if they 
can get people into the mainstream from such underprivileged 
conditions thats a great accomplishment 
every time tougaloo a 5yearold mare crosses the wire first 
knight 64 donates 10 percent of the purse to the predominately 
black private college in this tiny central mississippi town he 
estimates he has donated 30000 the past three years 
tougaloo is to run again saturday at thistledown in cleveland 
and at river downs in cincinnati on sept 3 she has won three 
races in ohio this year raising 9000 for tougaloo 
knight said he decided to name the horse after the college after 
receiving promotional literature from the 750student school 
the name was so attractive knight added and what they 
had to say about the school was even more attractive i guess i 
could have just named the horse tougaloo but i contacted the 
school and asked them if i could use their name in return i told 
them i would given them 10 percent 
tougaloo president adib shakir was on hand june 18 in cleveland 
when the mare took the 60000 purse at a race at thistledown 
a college benefiting from a race horse is a very unique 
situation said shakir this is my first time going to the 
horse races and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience i cant 
begin to say how appreciative we are of the generosity shown by mr 
knight 
the school ought to update its mailing list though 
i received this literature addressed to cl knight knight 
said well he was my grandfather but he died in the 1930s

a terrorist campaign in pakistan carried out 
by agents of afghanistans sovietbacked government accounted for 
well over half of all incidents of statesponsored terrorism 
worldwide last year according to a state department report 
released monday 
out of 189 such cases afghanistan carried out 127 against 
pakistan in its campaign of retaliation for pakistans backing of 
afghanistans anticommunist guerrilla movement the report said 
the report was prepared before last wednesdays incident in 
which a mysterious plane crash killed pakistani president mohammed 
zia ulhaq us ambassador arnold raphel brig gen herbert 
wassom and 27 others 
pakistani officials suspect sabotage but investigators lack 
conclusive evidence as to the cause of the crash which occurred 
330 miles south of islamabad 
state department officials insisting on anonymity said any 
comment on the cause of the crash would be speculative but added 
that afghan agents have to be among the suspects because of 
their alleged role in fomenting terrorism in pakistan 
diplomats at the afghan embassy here were unavailable for 
comment 
paul kriesburg a senior associate at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said it would be a mistake to assume 
automatically that afghan agents were responsible for the crash 
because zia had many other enemies they included some from within 
the pakistani military and others who were alienated by his 
authoritarian rule 
the state department compilation indicated that afghansponsored 
terrorist acts almost tripled those of iran listed second with 44 
libya was third with 7 terrorist episodes 
all told there were 832 international terrorist incidents last 
year according to the study 
when the pakistani numbers are subtracted the number of 
incidents in the rest of the world declined by almost 10 per cent 
from 1986 statistics the report said 
it said the pakistan campaign is being waged by the afghan 
ministry of state security known by the acronym wad 
zia said last november that the assassinations and bombings 
carried out against pakistani civilians were at the behest of the 
soviet union but moscow has denied the allegation 
us and pakistani officials estimate that bombs planted by 
afghan agents have killed more than 400 civilians in pakistan the 
bloodiest incident occurred in july 1987 when three car bombs 
exploded in the main bazaar of karachi killing 72 and injuring 260 
the report said it is likely that the soviets have been aware of 
afghan operations in pakistan because of the close ties between wad 
and the soviet intelligence agency kgb 
it said that while some of the material for the explosive 
devices can be purchased on the black market other items can be 
obtained only through soviet sources 
pakistan estimates that about 1500 soviet advisers work with 
wad

during last weeks twoday bank robbery and hostage drama have 
filed charges of criminal negligence against police lawyers said 
monday 
a week after the series of shootings and chases the story 
continued to dominate west german news media a debate on the 
incident was scheduled for wednesday by the local government in 
bremen where gunmen dieter degowski and hansjuergen roesner 
hijacked a city bus during the tense standoff 
lawyers bernd rosenkranz and gerold bischoff said they filed 
charges on behalf of the families of hostages emanuele di giorgi 
15 and silke bischoff 18 silke was gerold bischoffs niece 
the charge is that of negligently causing death due to failure 
to give assistance rosenkranz said 
under west german law prosecutors must investigate the charges 
to decide whether a trial is warranted

provoked the gunmen by detaining a female accomplice during the 
incident which began aug 16 with a bank robbery and 
hostagetaking in the town of gladbeck 
degowski 31 shot the italian youth after police temporarily 
seized accomplice marion irma loeblich at the grundbergsee rest 
stop on the superhighway near bremen the boy died after trying to 
protect his 9yearold sister from the bandits according to 
witnesses 
the charge also says that police missed several opportunities to 
end the hostage drama according to rosenkranz 
after that shooting degowski ms loeblich and roesner forced 
the bus to drive to the netherlands early thursday there they 
freed most of their two dozen hostages and then drove back to west 
germany with the two remaining hostages 
on thursday afternoon police ended the drama during a pitched 
battle on a busy highway near bonn police captured both gunmen and 
ms loeblich 34 
ms bischoff was killed in what authorities said was a shot 
fired by either degowski or roesner 32 
her uncle said he had filed charges of criminal negligence 
against police in bremen and in the state of northrhine westfalia 
it escalated into the bus hijacking in bremen 135 miles to the 
northeast of gladbeck after police met the gunmens demands for a

suit was filed last year in federal court in orlando fla damages 
were not specified when the case was transferred to virginia

solidfuel booster rocket blamed for the explosion

george bush charged monday that michael dukakis 
favors unilateral cuts in our defense and said the 
massachusetts democrat does not understand the 
peacethroughstrength theme that has guided reagan 
administration national security policy 
bush in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars convention 
chided dukakis for saying that he reflects president reagans views 
on the soviet union more closely than the vice president 
he also made an impassioned defense of embattled presidential 
campaign running mate dan quayle saying the indiana senator has 
been under shrill partisan attack over allegations that quayle 
a hawk on defense issues used family connections to sign up with 
an indiana national guard unit at the height of the vietnam war 
i salute the vietnam veterans here today those who fought in 
the rice paddies bush said but others served too some in the 
army reserve and some in the national guard and were not sent 
overseas 
true he didnt go to vietnam but his unit wasnt sent the 
vice president said but theres another truth he did not go to 
canada he did not burn his draft card and he damned sure didnt 
burn the american flag im proud to have him at my side 
in an address frequently interrupted by applause by the war 
veterans many of them wearing their garrison caps bush accused 
dukakis of having advocated policies in the past which would have 
weakened americas hand in dealing with the kremlin 
bush said a president must be committed to keeping us forces 
modernized saying only modernization and testing of weapons gives 
the soviets the incentive to negotiate real arms control 
agreements 
he said that i plan to negotiate strategic arms reductions 
with the soviets but i will not do what my opponent has 
suggested get rid of the mx the midgetman the b1 bomber and 
two carrier battle groups i will not make such unilateral cuts in 
our defense 
as veterans you know better than anyone else the terrible 
cost of war the republican presidential candidate said i 
too almost lost my life in one 
i think it is fair to ask this morning whether my opponent 
understands this fundamental truth that strength deters 
aggression that the way to peace is through strength 
peace through strength works bush said 
the bush campaign considered the vice presidents foreign policy 
speech the major bush event of the day bush was traveling to 
spokane wash for a republican rally there 
he used much of the palmer house speech here to criticize 
dukakis statements on national defense policy particularly the 
governors recent suggestion that reagan seeks to warm relations 
with moscow while bush argues a harder line to placate 
conservatives 
my opponent would have you believe that hes closer to ronald 
reagan on defense policy than i am bush said well hes about 
as close to ronald reagan on defense as winnie the pooh is to 
refrigerator perry in the area of bears bush was referring in 
the latter instance to william perry the more than 330pound 
offensive lineman for the chicago bears football team 
bush said that dukakis long supported a nuclear freeze but said 
the governor has stepped away from that position since the reagan 
administration consummated the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
inf treaty with the soviet union eliminating a whole class of 
nuclear missiles 
if the united states had embraced the nuclear freeze movement 
bush said it would have locked in soviet superiority in a range 
of strategic areas 
it would have prevented us from deploying the pershing 
missiles in europe he said how else would we have convinced 
the soviets that we were serious about having them remove their 
thousand ss20 warheads at a time when we had none 
in the microwave oven of the campaign my opponents position 
on the freeze has started to melt in belated recognition of the 
fact that our policies are working he said 
bush also chided dukakis for opposing the participation by 
massachusetts in construction of an emergency communications system 
for use by a president in the event of an attack 
only one governor refused to have a ground wave emergency 
network site in his state the governor of massachusetts he 
said 
bush said that he is pleased to see reform coming about in the 
soviet union but said the united states must not let down its 
guard in dealing with the kremlin 
andrei gromyko was right hes soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev got a nice smile hes also got iron teeth and one 
major reason why he favors agreements now is because were strong 
were not out of the woods yet he said the soviets are 
now deploying two new icbms the ss24 and ss25 so even with 
perestroika soviet military modernization including their own 
research into strategic defense has not slackened

farmers leaving for 10 days of 
harvesting free hay in idaho boarded buses in a downpour monday 
providing hope that their own droughtravaged pastures might be 
green by the time they get home 
but it will still take several weeks for that forage to grow 
back up assuming we get enough rain and even then you wonder what 
kind of growth there will be said dale johnson manager of the 
farm bureau spokesman a publication of the iowa farm bureau 
the drought has killed off part of it and then if you have a 
frost the first part of october that will curb things a little 
bit too he said 
about 60 farmers boarded two chartered buses for the trip 
hoping to harvest a train load of hay from reserve acreage 
a lot of these guys really need the hay so they made a quick 
decision to come some people hired people to go in their place 
johnson said 
the venture is a cooperative effort of the farm bureau in idaho 
and iowa with greyhound donating the buses burlington northern 
railroad donating freight space for the baled hay and three banks 
in chariton south of des moines putting up cash for meals along 
the way murdock said he expects other banks will also chip in 
in spite of the donated services organizer don murdock said he 
initially had trouble recruiting a crew for the excursion because 
the drought has made it even more difficult for farmers to leave 
home for extended periods 
murdock a regional manager of the farm bureaus office in 
chariton said many farmers were reluctant to commit a week to 10 
days because the drought makes it necessary for them to haul water 
and feed to cattle 
but when word spread he said the first bus filled up quickly 
and the second bus was filled nearly as fast 
in addition he said about 15 more farmers will leave for idaho 
later this week 
murdock said the idaho farm bureau offered unlimited hay to 
droughtstricken farmers if they would supply the labor for the 
harvest the hay will come from private fields ordinarily idled 
under the federal governments conservation reserve program but 
freed because of the drought 
murdock said he was told that 200 tons of hay already has been 
shipped to north dakota and that he hoped iowans could fill a 
freight train 
i dont know how much we can harvest but if weve got 75 guys 
out there on modern machinery haying all day thats a lot of 
hay said johnson 
murdock said first priority for the hay will go to those making 
the trip 
those next in line will be farmers needing hay but unable for 
physical or other reasons to go to idaho including an elderly 
couple that murdock said were feeding their cattle by cutting down 
trees so the animals can eat the foliage 
the lady is about 70 and said she can run machinery and wanted 
to go while her husband about 75 stayed behind murdock said 
i wouldnt let her go but im going to make darn sure they get 
some hay

safety features in the redesigned space 
shuttle booster rocket appear to have performed as designed during 
a crucial testfiring despite deliberately incorporated flaws a 
spokesman said monday 
the test was the fifth and final fullscale firing needed to 
qualify the solidfuel booster for flight 
engineers from morton thiokol inc and nasa have torn down the 
aft skirting and nozzle section of the 126footlong rocket that 
was fired last thursday at morton thiokols plant 25 miles west of 
brigham city said company spokesman rocky raab 
everything continues to look very very good raab said of 
the weekend examinations no problems whatever were uncovered 
from what theyve seen so far it looks like the best nozzle 
yet 
if the positive evaluation of the rocket holds nasa officials 
have said they expect to set a firm launch date in late september 
or early october for the first shuttle flight since challenger 
exploded on jan 28 1986 
engineers also examined the test boosters nozzle section 
looking for any indications of unexpected failure in features 
designed to contain superhot exhayst gases raab said 
a nasadesigned nozzle component failed during the second of 
five qualifying firings last december subsequent testfirings 
incorporated a morton thiokol nozzle design that had been 
successfully used in the first fullscale test in august 1987 and 
has performed well since 
nasa grounded the shuttle program after the challenger disaster 
in which seven astronauts died a presidential commission blamed 
the disaster on a faulty booster seal between segments of one

removing another of the boosters four segments about every two 
days 
we should be able to remove the aft segment about thursday 
allowing them to look at the mostflawed field joint there will be 
extensive documentation and testing done when they break that

they should finish up about two weeks after the firing he 
said adding that final nasa clearance for the boosters use should 
come shortly after that

intentional flaws morton thiokol officials said the flaws were 
intended to test the new boosters safety features to their limits 
the third joint was left unflawed in order to serve as a 
comparison raab said 
among the defects were separations in bonded adhesive insulation

the dan quayle dilemma revolving generally 
around questions of inexperience and privilege has ensnarled 
george bush at a critical moment and threatens the republican 
candidates appeal to the reagan democrats who helped make him 
what he is today 
the emerging image of quayle as an overindulged rich kid is not 
so much quayles problem as bushs the issues reflect as much on 
bushs judgment in 1988 as quayles judgment as a 22yearold in 
1969 
while decrying the shrill partisan attacks against quayle 
bush apparently cant answer the quayle questions himself last 
friday he was asked by time magazine if the media was overreacting 
to the quayle questions and said 
yes damn right but i dont know what the facts are i have 
to wait and see what facts are driving this 
bush would rather be talking about his lword the brand of 
democratic liberalism he associates with george mcgovern jimmy 
carter ted kennedy and now michael dukakis but the quayle matter 
makes that practically impossible in political terms bush has 
lost control of the agenda 
i wish all this werent churning around out there bush told 
time its distracting attention from the campaign itself 
republican activists across the country have been supportive of 
quayle while the washington gop establishment is openly wary 
karen stram chairwoman of the maine republican party calls the 
quayle controversy peripheral and says voters deserve to hear 
a clear dialogue between bush and dukakis she complained that tv 
coverage of bushs big night in new orleans last thursday could be 
summed up he gave a good speech and the latest on the quayle 
story is 
house republican leader bob michel asked if quayle should be 
taken off the ticket said monday if there was something 
additional that came up that was a distraction or a 
disqualification well the options always there but i dont see 
it at this juncture 
was bushs choice of quayle a mistake im not going to call 
it a mistake yet he said adding once youve committed 
yourself to a role you pretty much have to see it through 
a similar nottooringing endorsement came sunday from senate 
republican leader bob dole the world war ii combat hero who 
apparently ran second in bushs vice presidential deliberations he 
embraced the ticket again but said right now id guess there 
are a number of reagan democrats who are going to remain undecided 
or maybe go the other way to dukakis 
i mean theyre out there in my little hometown he said of 
these crossover voters who put reagan and bush in office and i 
must tell you in my generation you knew who was in the guard and 
who was in uniform fighting for their country so theyre very 
sensitive about it they didnt have anybody they could call 
well my father wore overalls whos he going to influence 
most recent surveys indicate dukakis leads bush among the 
reagandemocrats already the scent of special privilege cant help 
among the overall and bluecollar voters that dole refers to 
today the questions of quayle privilege amount to this 
did quayle use unusual family influence to get into the national 
guard thereby ducking the draft and an almost certain ticket to 
vietnam did quayle trade on family influence to get into indiana 
university law school after being a proverbial c student as 
an undergraduate 
theres been nothing that has been substantiated that any 
rules were violated that we did anything that was unfair quayle 
said monday in response to questions about his entry to law school 
and the guard 
on another matter quayle was asked last week what executive 
experience had prepared him to become vice president and cited 
among other things his work in the attorney generals office while 
attending law school at night 
now questions are being raised as to how the young quayle landed 
this job quayles father says an influential family employee got 
quayle an interview with the attorney general 
these matters caught offguard a presidential campaign that is 
bragging about its competence and had since march 8 to evaluate the 
many republicans who might add to the bush ticket did quayle 
mislead the bush interviewers did bush and his people ask the 
right questions 
however voters eventually decide to judge the quayle candidacy 
answering these questions is not the way george bush hoped to take 
advantage of the momentum he earned thursday night in new orleans 
conservative columnists evans and novak described the quayle 
questions as a skunk at the picnic

the gate to the school building but officials instead ordered the 
deputies to take the children 
after the confrontation between the boy and the principal gorst 
asked strode to bring his children into school strode said he 
refused and walked off with the three children 
at that point gorst asked him to bring the younger children 
back saying only duffey was suspended strode said 
they just dont want duffey at school period he said 
pepper shes scared to death now

president reagan monday signed 
legislation increasing significantly the liability of nuclear power 
companies for compensation of the public in the event of an 
accident 
the bill extends for 15 years a law passed in the 1970s designed 
to provide such protection 
the new law like the old one requires private insurance of 
150 million per reactor it increases from 5 million to 63 
million per reactor the secondtier insurance provided by the 
federal government 
altogether the amount of compensation available in the event of 
a nuclear accident would be increased to over 7 billion 
the act that is being extended also makes feasible commercial 
nuclear power generation the president said 
i sign this legisaltion in the midst of a summeer that has 
brought record temperatures to much of our country the president 
said as a consequence many of our utilities find themselves 
near the limits of their powergenerating capacity 
the implication of this situation is clear our nation must 
move forward into a new era of safe economical and clean nuclear 
power he added

a fisherman reeling in his hook found 
sticks of dynamite instead of a fish and that led to a search in 
which police believe they have recovered dynamite stolen last month 
at gunpoint 
the july 19 theft of 100 pounds of dynamite along with 200 
blasting caps caused concern in part because it took place 
during the democratic national convention in atlanta 
but on saturday a man fishing in the yellow river reeled in a 
surprise 
newton county sheriffs detective lt ezell brown said danny 
duffey of jackson called officers in nearby butts county and 
reported that he had snagged two sticks of dynamite 
butts county deputies contacted newton county deputies who went 
to the scene that night but found no more dynamite on sunday fire 
officials from both counties went to the river and eight divers 
found more dynamite brown said 
newton county police think it was the dynamite stolen july 19 
from a worker for a douglasville explosives company who was robbed 
by an armed man wearing a ski mask 
we feel that weve done a total recovery of what was stolen 
from henry county brown said but he would not disclose how much 
dynamite was found

new knowledge of arctic weather currents and 
ice drift and analysis of robert pearys documents indicate the 
explorer hailed as the first person to reach the north pole may 
have missed the mark by 30 to 60 miles a british arctic expert 
says 
navigational errors gaps in pearys expedition diary his own 
sullen behavior on his return and his extraordinary distance 
claims which have never been duplicated even on snowmobile cast 
doubts on pearys feat 
the peary controversy was reopened by wally herbert in the 
september issue of national geographic magazine and summarized 
monday by the new york times which had bought exclusive rights to 
pearys original story 
the newspapers money helped pay for the expedition but it was 
the national geographic society then an elite scientific group 
whose journal grew into one of the worlds most popular magazines 
that certified pearys achievement and dismissed the rival claim of 
dr frederick a cook who said he reached the pole a year earlier 
cook had sold his story to the times rival the new york herald 
tribune but his journals were lost in transit from the arctic to 
his home 
pearys diary and other documents of his 1909 expedition held 
in the national archives in washington were opened to scholars 
recently by the peary family 
herbert noted that the diary entry for april 6 1909 the day 
peary is supposed to have reached the pole made no mention of it 
but a loose page was inserted that proclaimed the pole at 
last 
according to the account of pearys aide de camp matthew 
henson peary showed no desire to celebrate on his return to the 
base camp after their fiveday sprint to the pole with four 
eskimos henson said peary turned away with both hands covering his 
eyes when henson went to shake his hand 
henson who was the first black polar explorer may actually 
have reached the pole first if either of them did since he 
scouted in front of peary henson published his journal in 1912 and 
it caused a falling out with peary who had wanted only his 
observations to be published 
pearys diary contained no detailed record of wind speed 
weather and ice conditions during the crucial 30 hours when he 
reportedly made his sprint to the pole neither did it record the 
systematic sextant readings necessary to determine ones position 
relative to the sun herbert said 
herbert also noted that his chronometer critical in 
navigation was 10 minutes fast an error he was not aware of 
while on the ice this alone could have put him west of the pole 
by 18 miles 
no explorer since peary has matched his claimed speed over the 
polar ice pack peary said he made the 296mile round trip by 
dogsled from base camp to pole in eight days with 198 miles 
covered in four days

the creator of the bankrupt sasson jeans empire 
surrendered monday and was ordered held without bail for violating 
an agreement that had freed him while he awaited trial for 
allegedly threatening the life of a judge 
paul guez who gave himself up to federal marshals had 
disappeared last week while free on 100000 bond then appeared 
without his lawyers before the judge he is accused of threatening 
guez appeared before us district judge michael b mukasey who 
rejected the defendants argument that he misunderstood the 
arrangement that allowed him to come to new york from california 
last week to attend to bankruptcy proceedings 
i find your account of how confused you were unconvincing 
mukasey said the restrictions were reasonable and perfectly 
obvious they would have been obvious to a child 
mukasey had revoked guezs bail and issued a warrant for his 
arrest friday after the government said guez violated the 
conditions of his release after his arrest in may for threatening 
the life of us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
after his release guez was sent to california where he spent 
28 days in a drug rehabilitation center since getting out he has 
been staying with relatives in the los angeles area 
early last week guez came to new york on the condition that he 
remain in the custody of one of his two lawyers but the lawyers 
lost track of him wednesday and guez appeared before lifland on 
thursday without the lawyers 
lifland notified assistant us attorney gilbert childers 
guezs lawyer gerald j mcmahon argued monday that his client 
did not willfully violate the terms of his bail and had 
remained in close contact with another lawyer guillermo a gleizer 
according to federal prosecutors guez 43 threatened to kill 
lifland and the trustee he appointed to oversee sassons 
reorganization if a result contrary to his interest were to be 
reached 
the tunisianborn guez arrived in the united states in 1976 with 
74 and a new style of french cut jeans through clever advertising 
he made millions also licensing the sasson label for watches 
lingerie and luggage 
but the company beset by to internal feuds was swamped by 
lawsuits leading to the chapter 11 reorganization

farmers hit hard by this years drought should 
think about enrolling highly erodible cropland in the longterm 
conservation reserve program the agriculture department said 
monday 
the current signup period for the crp will end on aug 31 more 
than 255 million acres have been enrolled in previous signups and 
the goal is to have 40 million to 45 million acres in the program 
by the end of 1990 
under the program farmers offer bids to take land from crop 
production and plant it to grass or trees for 10 years as a guard 
against erosion in return they get federal assistance to pay for 
up to half of the cost of establishing the protective cover plus 
annual rental payments for the crp land 
vern neppl acting executive vice president of the departments 
commodity credit corp said farmers may bid to enroll eligible 
land that has not been harvested in 1988 due to drought 
if their bids are accepted the producers will receive their 
first crp rental payments in 1988 neppl said also they will 
be guaranteed payments for nine more years an additional source of 
income regardless of weather condition during those years 
cropland that has been hayed in counties approved for drought 
relief is eligible for the crp if it meets program requirements 
but there may be a reduction in the 1988 payment neppl said 
producers also have the option of enrolling land for 1989 
enrollment of erodible land in the crp will help farmers meet 
the conservation provisions of the 1985 farm law neppl said those 
require producers to have an approved conservation plan for 
erodible land in place by jan 1 1990 to remain eligible for usda 
program benefits

six cubanamericans ran a mercenary training camp 
in florida to aid nicaraguan rebels according to a federal 
indictment unsealed monday 
one of the six is also accused of shipping a cannon a mortar 
and other weapons to contras under the guise of humanitarian aid 
the miamiarea men allegedly violated the neutrality act which 
bans private action against a government at peace with the united 
states the indictment alleges that the defendants operated from 
june 1983 to september 1986 
there is no declared war against nicaragua assistant us 
attorney mark schnapp said people dont have the option to go 
down there and engage in combat on their own 
eulalio francisco frank castro 46 one the two men who 
allegedly financed the 60man training camp on the outskirts of 
naples had been arrested here in june 1983 for allegedly smuggling 
loads of marijuana by sea us drug enforcement administration 
spokesman jack hook said monday 
the mercenary camp allegedly began operations the same month 
and the charges against castro were subsequently dismissed hook 
said he did not know why the charges were dropped 
schnapp turned away questions about a possible drug link to the 
contra aid operations which has been the subject of congressional 
investigations 
there is no allegation of any drug shipment involved in any of 
this schnapp said 
also indicted was rene corvo who has been accused by some 
witnesses before congressional committees of engaging in drug 
traffic a 1986 us state department report said there was no 
information connecting corvos group in miami to drug smuggling 
corvo castro joseph marcos and sergio becerra turned 
themselves in monday before us magistrate lurana snow in fort 
lauderdale while agents were trying to contact the other two 
defendants rafael torres jimenez and francisco hernandez 
corvo faces the most serious charges in the indictment which 
was prepared by the same federal grand jury that indicted contra 
leader adolfo caleros brother mario calero exmercenary jack 
terrell and others on similar charges 
corvo faces a maximum 38 years in prison on four weapons charges 
plus counts of violating the neutrality act and conspiring to 
violate it the other five face only the neutrality act violations 
and face a maximum eight years in prison 
in march 1985 corvo allegedly shipped nine weapons to costa 
rican antisandinista groups through fort lauderdale and el 
salvador and faces federal weapons counts schnapp said 
one shipment allegedly landed on the ranch of john hull a 
onetime cia contact according to congressional witnesses and 
other reports 
schnapp said questions about hull if any would be forwarded to 
the special prosecutors office in washington 
there was a portion of the overall investigation of 
individuals who were facilitating contra activities that was turned 
over to the special prosecutors office schnapp said 
castro and marcos are accused of financing the camps 
operations while corvo and the other three allegedly trained 
mercenaries mostly cubans and nicaraguans at the camp the 
activities were apparently not secret and the camp was filmed in 
1985 by a television crew schnapp said 
some of the defendants in the earlier case have argued their 
activities were sanctioned and even directed by the reagan 
administration they have a motion before roettger asking him to 
decide if the united states was really at peace with the 
sandinistas as is required under the act 
schnapp said the new indictment did not include any evidence 
that the men were acting on behalf of the reagan administration 
the indictment would indicate that they were not sanctioned 
said schnapp 
joe adams who pleaded guilty to neutrality act violations in 
the earlier indictment was sentenced to one days probation by 
us district judge norman roettger

britannias waves of bitter and stout flowed 
unabated monday even after big ben chimed 3 oclock as drinkers 
toasted the new laws that went into effect permitting pubs to stay 
open throughout the day 
ever since 1915 when the government moved to curb drinking by 
munitions workers all pubs wine bars and hotel bars have been 
required to stop serving alcohol between 3 pm and 530 pm 
now they can serve beer wine and spirits uninterrupted from 11 
am to 11 pm on weekdays on sundays which have always had the 
shortest drinking hours alcohol now can be served from noon to 3 
pm a onehour extension and from 7 pm to 1030 pm 
it gives us new freedom said elton mouna manager of the 
sea horse pub in londons financial district it doesnt treat us 
like children anymore 
celebrating bankers and stockbrokers jammed the pub at 3 pm 
when big bens chimes were broadcast live and town crier alfie 
howard put down his pint of beer to give the new laws his stamp of 
approval 
oyez oyez oyez with the authority invested in me as 
official town crier i am commanded to announce that in accordance 
with the licensing laws of her britannic majesty from this time 3 
oclock henceforth licensees shall dispense beverages for sale 
he cried 
in exeter in southeastern england landlord shaun oreilly 
turned the mill on the exe pub into a makeshift office to persuade 
patrons they could do business there 
he brought in mobile telephones photocopiers and faxing 
facilities and drafted extra staff to act as secretaries 
with portable phones and other modern gadgets many executives 
do not need to be in the office to work and a pub is often a more 
relaxed place for a business meeting oreilly said 
i would hope to see business people using the pub for late 
lunches and teatime meetings he said this is only an 
experiment but if it works out we will try to arrange these 
facilities permanently 
customer alan collyer a company director said i have always 
liked doing business in the pub and with the new hours it can 
become my second office its a lot less formal and its easier 
for your clients to relax especially now that you dont have to 
keep one eye on your watch 
for the past 73 years the bartenders warning bellow of last 
orders has created an instant traffic jam at exactly 250 pm 
as patrons clamored for one last drink before heading back to work 
ten minutes later to the cry of time gentlemen please 
men still outnumber women in pubs britain went dry for 2 hours 
britons grew accustomed to the ritual but it confounded parched 
tourists interested in sampling traditional english ale or having 
an afternoon snack 
they just cannot physically understand it mouna said 
they cant work it out so now we wont have those problems we 
can just welcome guests in and entertain them as weve always 
wanted to 
pubs dont have to change their hours if they dont want to and 
the national licensed victuallers association predicted that 
almost half the 67000 pubs in england and wales would stick to the 
old ways 
publicans and brewers agreed that pubs in seaside and tourist 
towns and city bars will benefit most from increased trade while 
residential and country pubs probably would continue to call 
time on weekdays at 3 pm 
i think most people in the neighborhood are going to stay 
open as i am for a couple of months to see what difference it 
makes said aubrey brightman landlord of the rising sun pub in 
central london 
the brewers society forecast at least 25000 new jobs would be 
generated by the longer drinking hours and that pubs would win back 
lost trade from fastfood outlets 
many pub managers say theyll expand their food menu and some 
have even bought coffemakers for the first time the sherlock 
holmes pub near trafalgar square began serving traditional 
afternoon teas 
the british medical association and antidrinking groups oppose 
the extended hours fearing increased alcoholrelated illness and 
drinkrelated crime 
the scottish office said the extended pub hours introduced in 
scotland more than a decade ago had little impact on the amount of 
alcohol abuse 
home office minister douglas hogg said he saw no connection 
between alcohol abuse and the ending of the compulsory afternoon 
closing time and many pubgoers applauded the demise of the 250 
dash for one last drink 
people would pile drinks into them because they knew that they 
wouldnt be able to get another socalled social drink until later 
in the evening said newspaper researcher lynn wilson 
people arent going to rush to finish their drinks added 
her colleague jenny leach people will drink at a more leisurely 
and sensible pace

the caretaker cabinet of the late 
president mohammad zia ulhaq agreed monday to continue his 
policies and government officials denied recurring rumors of a 
military takeover 
ismail patel of the ministry of information said we are 
hearing the rumors but there is no basis to them 
us army gen cloyd pfister led a group of american 
investigators to the site of the c130 airplane crash that killed 
zia us ambassador arnold raphel and 28 other people on wednesday 
american and pakistani crash experts searched the debris to 
determine what caused the transport plane to explode minutes after 
takeoff near the indian border 
caretaker president ghulam ishaq khan the former senate 
chairman who became the new leader by constitutional succession 
says he is convinced the crash was caused by saboteurs 
ishaq khan 73 held his second cabinet meeting monday patel 
said the cabinet discussed the continuation of islamization 
the process set in motion by zia to make the moslem koranic code of 
justice the law of the land 
although there was no official statement patel said the cabinet 
decided to continue zias policies including support of the moslem 
insurgents fighting the sovietbacked government in afghanistan 
several officials and pakistani newspapers reported hearing 
rumors of the imposition of martial law and the arrest of ishaq 
khan or of army chief of staff gen aslam baig authorities said 
nothing was afoot 
there have been no reports of unrest since zias death ended his 
11year rule ishaq khan said a state of emergency was in effect 
but said it had not been necessary to invoke martial law or 
restrict civil rights 
the united states has informed the soviet union and india in 
separate messages sent to moscow and new delhi that american 
support for pakistan remains strong in the wake of zias death 
the point is we wanted to reassure them that our policy is 
unchanged and that we are going to stand by pakistan said a 
us official who spoke monday in washington on condition of 
anonymity 
pakistan under zia was the closest us ally in central asia and 
the conduit for the shipment of american and chinese weapons to 
afghan rebels fighting a guerrilla war against the afghan 
government and soviet troops

democrat michael dukakis on monday urged 
voters to compare his selection of a running mate to george bushs 
choice when weighing their vote for president 
he also said he was eager to debate his republican opponent on 
foreign policy and national security issues 
dukakis has shied away from direct criticism of bushs selection 
of indiana sen dan quayle to round out the republican ticket but 
on monday said it obviously will be an issue in the election 
how we make our decisions how we make the presidential 
selections who we select whether or not that person should be 
a heartbeat away from the presidency obviously will be an an issue 
in the campaign dukakis told a news conference in lowell during 
a gubernatorial trip to northeastern massachusetts 
this is a judgment the american people will have to make 
said dukakis who last week touted the credentials of his running 
mate texas sen lloyd bentsen as a way of questioning bushs 
judgment in picking quayle 
theyve had an opportunity now to watch michael dukakis make 
his selection and geoge bush make his decision dukakis said 
and they will judge us on this and other issues 
dukakis criticized bush for not yet agreeing to a debate 
schedule and asked that the first facetoface confrontation be 
devoted to national security and foreign policy bush has 
frequently criticized dukakis as a novice at national security and 
foreign policy and did so again monday 
how someone who sat there and did nothing while we sold arms 
to the ayatollah can seriously talk about leadership in the persian 
gulf is beyond me dukakis said 
the governor filled his visit with references to his higher 
ambitions touting state health insurance economic development and 
housing programs as models he would promote nationally if elected 
president 
dukakis was returning to his brookline home tonight for a 
briefing on national security issues to be led by william webster 
director of the central intelligence agency bentsen also was to 
attend the briefing one of a series the presidential and vice 
presidential nominees will receive before the election rep louis 
stokes chairman of the house intelligence committee and rep lee 
hamilton its former chairman also were invited 
bentsen and his wife beryl ann were to have dinner with the 
dukakises prior to the briefing dukakis aides said the governors 
home would be checked for electronic surveillance devices prior to 
the session 
dukakis also issued a statement supporting demonstrations in 
poland in favor of the outlawed solidarity trade union referring 
to solidarity leader lech walesa as the true leader of the polish 
people 
the visit by dukakis to northeastern massachusetts which he 
will resume tuesday is part of his annual summer tradition of 
visiting different regions of the state 
as he did with a trip last week to central massachusetts 
dukakis began the visit at a luncheon with area officials 
educators and business and labor leaders before attending state 
events that mesh with themes of his presidential campaign 
in lowell a oncethriving mill city that fell on extremely hard 
times in the 1970s dukakis announced the construction plans for a 
new downtown community college at a mill complex destroyed by fire 
two years ago and a 150000 grant for a manufacturing research 
center to provide technical assistance to smaller manufacturing 
operations 
the city has made a dramatic economic comeback and its former 
mills have been refurbished for a variety of business housing and 
other projects dukakis frequently refers to lowell and nearby 
lawrence a city on his tuesday agenda as examples of how he has 
encouraged economic development in struggling areas 
we can do for this country what we have done here 
dukakis told the luncheon recalling his visist last week to 
struggling rural areas of illinois missouri and arkansas they 
too want to have to have the same hope and optimism the same 
vision of whats ahead that you have created in lowell dukakis 
said 
former us sen paul tsongas told the gathering he hoped a 
visit to lowell by reporters covering the presidential campaign 
would put to rest republican charges that dukakis overstates his 
role in the areas resurgence 
we were getting irritated by those who say that michael 
dukakis had nothing to do with the massachusetts mircale 
tsongas said

syndicated columnist carl t rowan probably 
had been told he did not have to register a revolver he used to 
shoot a teenager trespassing in his yard the city governments 
top lawyer says 
however city officials on monday refused to drop charges 
against rowan who has written in favor of gun control he was 
charged with possession of an unregistered handgun and ammunition 
after wounding a youth who had been taking an unauthorized predawn 
swim in his backyard swimming pool june 14 
rowan has claimed that the weapon was given to him in 1982 by 
his son carl jr a former fbi agent both rowans have steadfastly 
maintained that city officials instructed them that the gun did not 
have to be registered since rowan jr was a federal agent 
that was buttressed by a memo written aug 11 from district of 
columbia corporation counsel frederick d cooke jr to police chief 
maurice t turner indicating that some police officers have erred 
in enforcing the gun registration law 
it has come to my attention that some officers in the mpd 
metropolitan police department have interpreted the provision so 
as to exempt from registration firearms owned by mpd officers or 
other law enforcement officers cooke wrote turner in the memo 
obtained by the associated press on monday 
i understand further that when an officer ceases to be an mpd 
or other law enforcement officer this exempt status is not 
revoked and the former officer is not required to surrender the 
weapon 
the citys farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance which requires 
that all weapons purchased after that date be registered with the 
city should be amended to make clear that law enforcement officers 
are not exempt from this regulation cooke concluded 
police were telling people that once they left any police 
force they didnt have to register the weapon said raoul l 
carroll rowans attorney the memo makes that clear 
the document was included in material carroll submitted to 
district of columbia superior court in hopes of getting the charges 
dismissed 
beverly burke a spokeswoman for cooke said city officials 
still intend to prosecute the columnist she would not comment on 
the memo which she described as private not something that 
should be in the public domain police also declined to comment 
efforts to reach rowan for comment were not immediately 
successsful 
rowans trial has been set for sept 22 if convicted of 
possessing an unregistered weapon and ammunition he could receive 
up to one year in jail and a 1000 fine on each count

the leaders of the greek and turkish communities 
in cyprus said monday they will strive to achieve a settlement that 
would lead to the withdrawal of turkish troops from their 
wardivided island 
president george vassiliou the greek cypriot leader and rauf 
denktash the president of the breakaway turkish cypriot state 
arrived monday at the invitation of un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar 
at a meeting wednesday they are expected to discuss differences 
that have fueled tensions on the island since turkey invaded north 
cyprus in 1974 in the wake of a coup by supporters of union with 
greece it is the first time leaders of the divided nation have met 
in nearly three years 
the cyprus problem has lasted too long 14 years of continuous 
occupation of a large part of our small island is too much and it 
is high time it was settled vassiliou told reporters the 
withrawal of the turkish troops is the key problem 
i want a settlement very badly denktash told reporters 
earlier 
denktash is president of the turkishcypriot federated state of 
north cyprus established in 1983 and recognized only by turkey 
he said the estimated 35000 turkish troops would begin 
withdrawing from cyprus only after the formation of a 
transitional government and after the turkish cypriot community 
begins feeling it does not need the guarantee of their continuing 
presence for its safety 
the main obstacles to a settlement have been greek cypriot 
demands for the withdrawal of the turkish troops and 45000 turks 
who have settled in north cyprus as well as the repatriation of 
200000 greek cypriot refugees one third of the islands 
population 
i am going into these negotiations with cautious optimism 
i know it is not easy to find a solution and it is going to be a 
long process vassiliou said 
after the meeting wednesday between the two leaders in the 
presence of perez de cuellar the talks will move to nicosia 
denktash said 
vassiliou a businessman entered politics for the first time in 
february when he was elected president he has declared his 
intention to settle the cyprus problem within a year of his 
election 
by contrast denktash became a prominent turkish cypriot leader 
before the island gained its independence from british colonial 
rule in 1960 he has engaged in fruitless negotiations with other 
greek cypriot leaders since tensions began in the 1960s 
this new leader mr vassiliou we are told intends to 
establish a partnership through a bizonal federation with us and 
he has created a good reputation as a man of good intentions who 
really wants a settlement thats why we are here denktash said 
vassiliou told reporters 
it would be nice if the turkish troops could be withdrawn in a 
day but that is impractical what is important is for the troops 
to be withdrawn and that we arrive at an agreed solution 
perez de cuellar who arrived monday night said he hoped the 
talks with the two leaders will produce a date for the resumption 
of the intercommunal talks and a climate of dialogue

the greek orthodox church said monday it 
has called for a ban on the film the last temptation of christ 
in greece claiming its interpretation of the life of jesus is 
horrifyingly vulgar 
archbishop seraphim of athens the orthodox church leader in 
greece sent a letter to the government saying martin scorseses 
film would clash directly with the religious sensitivities of our 
people 
the film attempts a horrifyingly vulgar representation of the 
person of the founder of the christian faith the letter said 
in his appeal seraphim cited the greek constitution which 
enshrines orthodox christianity as the countrys official religion 
church spokesman yiannis hadzifoti said the letter was sent to 
education minister george papandreou and minister to the premiers 
office akis tsochatzopoulos just a few days ago but so far 
there had been no official response 
in the movies most controversial scene the crucified jesus 
imagines making love to mary magdalene scorsese has said it 
shouldnt offend audiences when taken in context as christs 
last temptation to get married and lead a normal human life 
scorseses film is based on a novel by greek author nikos 
kazantzakis who was threatened with excommunication by the 
orthodox church when the book came out in 1954 the last 
temptation is one of kazantzakis most popular books and it is 
still a big seller in greece 
the film is expected to be released in greece next month a 
couple of weeks after its shown at the venice festival according 
to a spokesman for united international pictures the distributor 
it has provoked accusations by religious traditionalists that it 
distorts christian theology thousands of people demonstrated when 
it was released two weeks ago in the united states where it was 
seen by packed houses in several cities 
in europe both protestant and roman catholic church groups have 
denounced the film in britain a conservative watchdog group is 
seeking a ban on grounds of blasphemy

a fire at a basement social club that killed 
seven people in the bronx was not arson as originally suspected 
fire officials said monday 
we believe at this point that the fire was accidental but 
many important witnesses who were badly injured have yet to be 
interviewed by fire marshals said fire department spokesman john 
mulligan 
arson had been suspected because of the rapid spread of the 
sunday fire 
dozens of injured patrons many severely burned remain at eight 
hospitals eighteen firefighters also were injured none seriously 
the club known as the cave or the hole has been raided by 
police five times since march and there have been nine arrests 
said tom kelly a spokesman for mayor edward koch and the people 
have been let go on violations which is not a misdemeanor two 
misdemeanors within a year allows the police commissioner to 
close the place under the padlock law 
in a raid police confiscate liquor and money kick everyone out 
and arrest the employees kelly said once in a while they arrest 
the patrons 
the club in the bronx does not have a liquor license kelly said 
most social clubs operate like bottle clubs in other states 
where customers bring their own liquor and get mixers from the 
management 
the club was a 50by75 foot tshaped space partitioned into 
several rooms with a bar at either side of the front entrance and 
a disc jockeys stand at the rear just past the bars were several 
tables and an area set aside for dancing 
patrons passed through a narrow doorway between a realty office 
and a store neighborhood residents said the entrance was always 
blocked by a shopkeepers steel gate a steel cellar door on the 
side street was locked 
mulligan described the steep narrow staircase that led down to 
the club as no better than a ladder

rolling robots bearing meals laundry and 
mail will become servants to thousands of inmates at alameda 
countys new jail when it opens next year 
called the smart cart by county engineers the boxy 
selfpropelled metal delivery machine is expected to head off 
mealtime violence by taking food to prisoners in the 15 buildings 
instead of the prisoners going to the food 
the jail layout is such that the sheriff wants to deliver the 
food instead of taking inmates to a central dining area said 
ruel brown assistant planner of the new facility 
the board of supervisors of the county east of san francisco has 
approved a 48 million contract for 18 robots made by apogee 
robotics inc of fort collins colo a company that already 
manufactures similar machines for several defense corporations 
the robots formally known as the automaticguided vehicle 
system stand 17 inches high two feet wide and six feet long each 
carries about 30 food trays 
at the new jail in santa rita the 250000 machine which looks 
like a squat filing cabinet will be dispatched from a central area 
and guided by two miles of wire embedded in the jails floor will 
deliver meals to the separate 96cell housing facilities they are 
equipped with sensors which see 12 feet ahead watching for 
obstacles 
alameda is the first jail system in the nation to install the 
robots said jim jones president of the manufacturer the company 
has produced similar robots used by ibm rockwell international and 
westinghouse electric corp to deliver supplies he said 
it had to be designed so that prisoners cant hide 
contraband in it jones said we wont have a problem with it 
unless the staff doesnt do regular preventative maintenance 
checks 
sheriffs representatives say they are sure the machines will 
improve security there will be no long walks to the kitchen or 
rowdy mealtime crowds thanks to the 1500pound stainlesssteel 
robot 
the alameda county sheriffs department plans to find out how 
tough the machines really are with a test patterned after a 
television luggage commercial 
a retired sheriffs captain armed with confiscated 
implements of destruction including an axe handle and ice pick 
will attempt to rough up one of the robots said ruel brown 
assistant project planner for the jail 
im not sure what he weighs but hes a big man brown said

if farmers boost plantings and the drought 
eases this years massive drain on the us wheat stockpile could 
be brought under control in 1989 the agriculture department said 
monday 
total wheat supplies in the 198889 marketing year that began on 
june 1 are estimated at about 31 billion bushels down more than 
20 percent from last season and the lowest in almost a decade the 
departments economic research service said in an outlook report 
more than 22 million acres of wheat land were idled under the 
usdas acreage program this year when farmers were required to 
setaside 275 percent of their base acres for 1989 they have to 
idle only 10 percent 
with increased area and average yields in 198990 the united 
states would be able to produce 25 billion bushels of wheat 
enough to cover likely use without a further stock decline the 
report said 
although the supply this years harvest plus excess left over 
from previous crops will be more than enough to meet expected 
use the wheat inventory by next june 1 is expected to be down to 
around 597 million bushels down from 1266 billion bushels this 
june 1 
based on the current rate of wheat use for domestic consumption 
and exports the us wheat supply next june 1 would represent an 
87day supply compared with reserves for 185 days this june 1 it 
also would be the smallest since 197374 
this years wheat harvest of 182 billion bushels is far short 
of the more than 25 billion bushels needed to cover expected 
domestic and export demands in 198889 the shortfall of 684 
million bushels has to come out of reserves 
thus according to the report the beginning inventory of 1266 
billion bushels is drawn down by the shortfall to 582 million 
bushels when imports of 15 million bushels are added the 
projected us wheat stockpile next june 1 becomes 597 million

the pentagon has asked congress to restore 
government financing for research on advanced airplane 
recognition systems of a type that might have prevented the 
shootdown of an iranian airliner by a navy cruiser 
such systems if proven feasible could make it easier for radar 
centers on the ground or at sea to identify the types of planes 
they detect for example distinguishing between a jet fighter and 
a cargo plane 
the funding request was presented formally by gordon a smith 
the assistant defense secretary for command control 
communications and intelligence systems just two weeks after the 
uss vincennes on july 3 shot down an iranian a300 airbus carrying 
290 people that the cruiser mistook for a f14 fighter jet 
in a letter to the house and senate appropriations committees 
smith urged congress to restore 92 million for research and 
development of socalled noncooperative targetrecognition 
systems 
congress had cut the money from the navys fiscal 1989 budget 
bill after discovering the navy and pentagon were not prepared to 
commit themselves to continuing the research in fiscal 1990 and 
beyond 
the navy says it made a decision to scrap a fiveyear research 
program in the field because of the overall pentagon budget squeeze 
it is requested that consideration be given to a floor 
amendment to restore the requested 92 million in navy funding for 
noncooperative identification efforts smith wrote on july 18 
smith made no reference to the vincennes incident but added 
the department of defense is striving to develop aircraft 
identification systems to provide effective control of our 
increasingly lethal air defense weapons this is not an easy 
problem however there is a noncooperative identification 
technique which has the potential to identify hostile and civil 
aircraft 
noncooperative identification is military slang for any system 
that doesnt rely on aircraft radio emissions to make an 
identification socalled cooperative systems now in use by most 
air forces involve one plane determining whether another is 
friendly by asking for a special radio transmission 
the vincennes in mistakenly classifying the iranian airliner as 
a hostile jet fighter apparently made a mistake in the way it 
interpreted that planes radio signal response 
a noncooperative system attempts to identify an airplane 
without asking for a radio transmission 
smith in his letter did not include any details of the navy 
research because he said the work was classified but he did say a 
new noncooperative system has been tested on one ship with very 
good results 
the senate already has responded to smiths plea by agreeing to 
provide the research money the house has yet to act however and 
the prospects for restoring the money still are uncertain

the ira blew up a car monday in 
east belfast killing a man police believe was a royal navy officer 
only three days after eight british soldiers were slain by another 
bomb 
police said the victim thought to be a 45yearold recruiting 
officer was the only casualty when the bomb exploded and the car 
burst into flames monday afternoon during rush hour just east of 
the downtown district 
the outlawed irish republican army which has focused its 
campaign of violence on the british security forces claimed 
responsibility in a telephone call to a northern ireland radio 
station 
the bomb exploded as the victim drove his gray ford capri over 
the queens bridge freelance photographer crispin rodwell said he 
was 50 yards behind as the car pulled away from traffic lights 
as it went to move off it disappeared in a ball of fire 
rodwell said it was immediately underneath a flyover overpass 
and the debris ricocheted off the underneath of the flyover 
some other cars stopped and some guys jumped out with fire 
extinguishers they tried to put out the fire but they could not 
get anywhere near they were beaten back by the flames it was just 
a fireball 
three people were treated for shock at a nearby hospital 
there was a woman in a silver volkswagen which veered off 
the road and hit one of the flyover supports rodwell said i 
think she was ok but she was taken away very shocked 
in the telephone call the ira said it had carried out the 
execution of a british soldier the ira is fighting to drive the 
british from protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the 
province with the irish republic which is 95 percent roman 
catholic 
eight soldiers were killed and 27 wounded early saturday when an 
ira bomb wrecked an unmarked military bus carrying members of the 
first battalion of the light infantry from belfast airport to their 
barracks at omagh 50 miles west all the dead were in their late 
teens and 20s and had been on furlough in mainland britain 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher said monday that 
detention without trial of people suspected of guerrilla activity 
had not been ruled out 
ken maginnis a protestant member of parliament from northern 
ireland who urged mrs thatcher to reinstate the policy said he 
gave her the names of three ira men he claimed were involved in the 
saturday bombing 
a letter bomb was sent to maginnis last week but was defused 
he claimed internment of 5070 top flight ira organizers would 
drastically reduce violence in northern ireland 
mrs thatcher ordered a security review after the bombing 
saturday which was the deadliest ira attack on the military since 
1982 the attack brought to 26 the number of soldiers killed in 
this summers ira blitz on british military targets in the 
province mainland britain and continental europe 
you do not tell your enemy precisely what it is you are going 
to do ever the prime minister told reporters who had asked what 
security measures the government could introduce to protect the 
soldiers we must never let the terrorists win 
northern ireland secretary tom king the cabinet member 
responsible for the province promised a relentless campaign 
against the men of evil 
government sources indicated sunday that mrs thatcher and king 
had decide against demands that known guerrillas be picked up on 
grounds the detentions would be a propaganda coup for the ira 
then prime minister edward heath a conservative introduced 
internment in northern ireland on aug 9 1971 about 2000 people 
were held without trial before prime minister harold wilson of the 
labor party abandoned it in december 1975 amid world criticism

iraq on monday accused iran of redeploying 
its troops along the central border region in violation of the 
3dayold ceasefire in the persian gulf 
the official iraqi news agency said iranian troops on saturday 
and sunday moved closer to iraqi positions on the central front as 
well as moving troops to other unspecified new areas 
the dispatch said iraq complained to united nations observers in 
the area warning that unless the iranians pulled back iraq would 
forcibly return them to their previous positions 
the un team intervened and asked the iranian side to 
withdraw and the iranian troops actually started withdrawal late 
monday the dispatch said 
the staterun agency did not identify the area beyond saying it 
was on the central front and gave no further details in its 
threesentence dispatch 
there was no immediate response to the iraqi claim from iran or 
from the peacekeeping force 
at the united nations a un official refused to discuss the 
alleged ceasefire violations but said un truce observers were 
defusing tensions successfully on the front line 
spokeswoman nadia younes also declined comment on reports from 
shipping sources in the persian gulf that un patrol boats had 
been seen cruising the strait of hormuz in the southern gulf and 
the shatt alarab waterway separating iran and iraq 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellars report to the 
security council calling for the establishment of the un 
iraniraq military observer group requested a naval patrol for 
certain sensitive areas in or near the shatt alarab 
ms younes declined to discuss whether the strait of hormuz 525 
miles southeast of the shatt alarab at the opposite end of the 
persian gulf could be considered near that waterway 
both areas have been flashpoints in the nearly 8yearold war 
the conflict broke out in the shatt alarab in september 1980 when 
iraq invaded iran 
in manama bahrain a kuwaitflagged cargo vessel one of 93 
vessels trapped in iraqi waters since the war began became the 
first to reach its homeport monday after the ceasefire 
the owners the kuwaitbased united arab shipping co said the 
ibn haithem reached the kuwaiti port of shuweikh 
according to lloyds register of ships there were nine vessels 
trapped at khor zubair nine at the adjacent umm alqasr water 
inlet and 75 in the shatt alarab estuary separating iraq and iran 
iraniraq peace talks being overseen by the united nations are 
set to begin thursday in geneva following a ceasefire that was 
implemented saturday as a first step in ending a conflict that has 
claimed about 1 million lives 
iran and iraq began observing the ceasefire saturday morning 
but have not given up swapping accusations and countercharges 
the official iraqi news agency said an iranian sniper killed an 
iraqi soldier saturday and iran claimed iraqi troops fired shots 
near a un observer team in the central region of the war front on 
saturday 
the un secretarygenerals office in new york released a 
letter from iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on monday stating 
that if the iranian navy attempts to search iraqi ships for war 
material iraq will resist it by such means as it deems 
appropriate 
aziz said such searches would violate the ceasefire provisions 
of un security council resolution 598 which called for the 
ceasefire troop withdrawal exchange of prisoners peace talks 
and establishment of an impartial commission to decide who was 
responsible for the conflict 
perez de cuellar told an airport news conference in geneva on 
monday that a peace settlement will require long and tedious talks 
but if there is a political will the rhythm could be quite 
rapid 
he said he may later name a deputy to lead the negotiations 
asked when he expected a comprehensive settlement he said this was 
a 100000 question 
the un chief said a major question in the talks initial phase 
was repatriating the more than 80000 prisoners of war 
he said he expects great cooperation from both sides on the 
pow issue and that he was pleased with the cooperation un 
military observers received from iran and iraq in monitoring the 
ceasefire

paramilitary police beat and kicked about 30 
people and arrested more than 100 others during protests marking 
the 20th anniversary of the sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia 
dissidents said monday 
dissident journalist sergei grigoryants demanded a government 
investigation of the numerous crimes committed during protests 
sunday and an explanation of what dissidents said was a new police 
unit created to break up demonstrations 
the arrests came during rallies marking the soviets 1968 move 
into czechoslovakia to stop the liberal reforms of the prague 
spring 
protesters who were arrested were brought into a closed 
courtroom monday and most received jail sentences of 10 to 15 days 
and fines of up to 320 the dissidents said 
tass the official soviet news agency provided details in a 
rare report on court proceedings and carried police accusations 
that protesters acted illegally 
tass said 96 people were arrested but members of the democratic 
union a new group calling itself an alternative to the soviet 
communist party claimed as many as 150 people were arrested 
yuri mityunov a spokesman for the democratic union said in a 
telephone interview that dozens of people remained in moscow jails 
monday night awaiting court appearances 
we demand the creation of an investigatory group of the 
procurator of the ussr for a full investigation of the numerous 
crimes committed by the socalled law enforcement organs on aug 
21 1988 grigoryants editor of the dissident journal glasnost 
said at a news conference in his moscow apartment 
about 500 demonstrators took part in an initial protest in 
pushkin square chanting prague prague prague when they were 
prevented from holding up banners about 500 paramilitary officers 
and police charged and dispersed them 
about 100 people took part in a later protest which also was 
broken up dissidents said 
grigoryants was detained outside a police station and said he 
saw several demonstrators being beaten dissidents said about 30 
people were kicked or beaten 
grigoryants said andrei babitsky an editor of glasnost 
received a concussion from a beating in a police bus and that an 
ambulance was called twice sunday evening to the police station to 
treat him 
maj gen nikolai myrikov deputy head of the department of 
internal affairs in moscow harshly criticized the rally organizers 
the organizers of the rally shouted provocative slogans 
carried posters whose contents were an insult to the dignity of 
soviet people spread slanderous leaflets and instigated those 
present to illegal actions the tass report quoted myrikov as 
saying 
grigoryants said demonstrators were beaten by about 10 members 
of what he described as a new force formed to break up protests 
members of the squad wore khaki clothing without insignia heavy 
black boots and berets with markings of the ministry of internal 
affairs grigoryants said 
a woman who was at one of the demonstrations anna savankova 
said she was told by a policeman at the scene that the force was 
specially trained to break up demonstrations 
the crackdown was in keeping with the kremlins steadfast 
defense of the sovietled invasion by warsaw pact forces on aug 
2021 in 1968 although some soviets have suggested the prague 
spring reforms crushed in czechoslovakia resemble those now being 
tried in the soviet union

the commander of the next space 
shuttle mission said monday the nations manned space program could 
not survive another tragedy like challenger and predicted it would 
not happen on his flight 
i have great confidence in the machine we feel it is a much 
safer machine navy capt rick hauck told the final news 
conference he and his crew will hold before their launching 
scheduled for late september or early october 
we clearly could not afford to lose another vehicle much less 
another crew hauck said i dont think the manned spaceflight 
program could withstand another challenger on sts26 haucks 
flight 
thats high stakes but im not concerned that thats going to 
happen in the last year and a half ive seen how weve modified 
the machine and how weve done business so i feel very comfortable 
with the flight 
hauck will command discovery on the first shuttle mission since 
challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on jan 28 1986 
killing the crew of seven 
his crewmates will be air force col richard covey the pilot 
and mission specialists george nelson mike lounge and dave 
hilmers a marine lieutenant colonel 
hauck said nasa has been hesitant to set a new date for the 
oftenpostponed launch because engineers are still troubleshooting 
two problems that developed during a test firing of discoverys 
engines on the launch pad at cape canaveral on aug 10 
one is a small leak of hydrogen gas detected in an area where 
the orbiter is joined to the external fuel tank the other is the 
apparent sluggishness of three gaseous oxygen valves in the fueling 
system 
there are some concerns about both of these he said we 
have to understand these better 
nasa officials said earlier they did not think the problems were 
serious that they were testing both systems and that they hoped to 
be able to announce resolutions and a launch date later this week 
hauck said the discovery mission is very important to the 
nation and to the space agency in getting back to flying 
lounge said he realized this is an important flight and our 
country will be looking at us but i dont feel any pressure 
because of it 
covey reported the fourday flight will be less complicated than 
most previous shuttle missions because nasa has elected to take a 
conservative approach on this first postchallenger mission 
were not breaking any new ground he said 
but covey said because of 210 modifications made to the orbiter 
the crew in essence will be making a shakedown flight of a new 
spacecraft we will have time to concentrate on those changes 
he said 
the astronauts main goal is to deploy a communications 
satellite they also will conduct 11 science and technology 
experiments 
the challenger disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of 
the shuttles two solid fuel booster rockets the rocket has 
undergone more than 50 modifications 
hauck said he is confident the rockets will work but the first 
two minutes of flight will be the most tense because the solids are 
converting so much kinetic energy once the solids have burned out 
and fallen away and were in smooth mainengine flight my pulse 
rate will drop he said 
hilmers said at launch time the crews thoughts will be with the 
challenger astronauts 
well be thinking of them but our thoughts will be more on 
the future than on the past he said the challenger tragedy 
was a great tragedy for the nation and a tragedy for each of us we 
cant dwell on it because if we do we might repeat the mistakes of 
the past 
hauck was asked if his crew was taking along any momentoes or 
was planning any ceremony in space for the challenger astronauts 
on the day when we have our press conference from space we 
will share them with you he replied the press conference is 
scheduled during the third day of the mission

playboy will publish new comments from a 
former female lobbyist about a vacation during which she shared a 
cottage with vicepresidential candidate dan quayle and two other 
congressmen the magazines managing editor said monday 
paula parkinsons remarks about events at the florida cottage 
eight years ago will appear in the text accompanying a women of 
washington pictorial in the november issue said playboy managing 
editor jonathan black parkinson will appear nude in the pictorial 
he said 
black declined to reveal what parkinson said 
the article originally was written well in advance of 
quayles selection by the gop said black she was mentioned 
in the story but we had no plans to run her picture 
after quayle was picked we got back in touch with her did 
some additional work and inserted the new material three days 
ago 
black declined to answer further questions about the article or 
its contents the magazine is scheduled to be on the newsstands 
oct 1 
parkinson first appeared nude in the magazine in 1980 several 
months after being identified as the washington lobbyist who shared 
a cottage with quayle and two other republican congressmen former 
reps tom railsback of illinois and thomas b evans of delaware 
parkinson said she had an affair with evans who later left the 
house quayle now the junior senator from indiana has said he did 
not have an affair with parkinson quayle has never been accused of 
intimacy with the former lobbyist 
a justice department investigation of parkinsons relationships 
with members of congress found no impropriety 
she didnt sleep with quayle said society columnist rudy 
maxa a longtime confidant of parkinson who was acting as an 
informal spokesman for her last week 
questions about the incident were revived last week when george 
bush named quayle as his gop running mate 
thats been looked into and theres absolutely nothing to 
it said bush campaign chairman james a baker iii when the issue 
resurfaced 
at the time of the incident parkinson was 30 years old and a 
lobbyist for an insurance industry group that opposed legislation 
to set up a national crop insurance program the bill passed in the 
house by a 235150 vote in september 1980 but quayle voted against 
it 
the justice department investigated parkinsons activities in 
connection with allegations of a sexandinfluence scandal but 
dropped its case in august 1981 without filing criminal charges 
playboys managing photo editor gary cole said sunday night he 
thinks the picture of parkinson posing nude was taken in the early 
80s

the original uncut version of upton sinclairs 
novel the jungle will be published in october eight decades 
after the original shocked the nation with its expose of squalid 
conditions in the chicago stockyards 
sinclair cut his original manuscript by a third for the 1906 
doubleday page edition to make the book more marketable according 
to gene degruson a professor and curator of rare books at 
pittsburg state university in kansas the new york times reported 
monday 
degruson said he pieced together the original novel from a 
truckload of rotting paper given to him in 1980 by a young man who 
had been hired to clean out the cellar of a farmhouse in girard 
kan the man recognized sinclairs name on the business records 
memos correspondence and other material and brought the boxes to 
the university library instead of the dump 
the jungle had been serialized for seven months in the 
appeal to reason published in girard it was the 
largestcirculation weekly newspaper in the country and the 
flagship paper of the socialist movement in the united states the 
house where the material was found apparently belonged to a friend 
of the managing editor of the appeal 
when doubleday published the book it caused meat sales to slump 
and spurred president theodore roosevelt to order an investigation 
that led to the nations first pure food and drug act 
considering the material that was expunged its amazing that 
the published book had any impact whatsoever degruson said 
revision was drastic degruson wrote in the introduction to 
the new edition due in october from st lukes press of memphis 
tenn sinclair changed the ending to make it more upbeat and added 
a love story among other revisions he said 
most of the deletions pertained to the socialist party which 
sinclair joined in 1902 but he also omitted passages criticizing 
the press big business and marriage 
sinclair was the author of more than 90 books including the 
dragons teeth which won him a pulitzer prize in 1942 he died 
in 1968 at age 90

jerusalem the number of palestinians traveling to jobs in 
israel from the occupied lands has declined by nearly 20 percent in 
the 8monthold uprising and workers say fear of attack by jewish 
extremists is a major reason 
the loss of manpower has caused serious problems in construction 
and agriculture which are dependent on cheap arab labor 
only about 85000 of the 105000 palestinians who worked in 
israel before the rebellion began last dec 8 still hold those 
jobs said arie pikel the labor and welfare ministry spokesman 
he said most arabs who had stopped working in israel were 
unskilled daylaborers who were not registered with authorities and 
received no social benefits 
israeli employers want to replace the palestinians with imported 
labor the initial response was negative but labor and welfare 
minister moshe katzav has begun approving such requests 
many palestinians quit their jobs because of pressure from 
leaders of the uprising and gangs of masked youths who enforce the 
leadership orders buses taking palestinian workers to israel are 
stoned and workers who defy orders to strike are threatened 
recently increasing antipalestinian violence inside israel has 
added a new dimension to the problem 
last saturday a palestinian guarding a construction site in 
downtown tel aviv told police a gang of seven israelis beat him 
unconscious 
a shack was set on fire on a construction site in tel avivs or 
yehuda suburb two weeks ago killing three sleeping workers from 
the gaza strip 
the attack inspired riots in the gaza strip and the army imposed 
a threeday curfew 
police arrested two israeli suspects and said monday 
investigators found the fire to be criminal and not related to the 
arabisraeli political conflict 
many palestinians say the increasing tensions keep them closer 
to home 
fadel mohammed qik 21 of the arub refugee camp near bethlehem 
opened a photography studio after leaving a job as a watchman in 
israel that paid the equivalent of 360 a month 
even if i make only 180 a month its better to work in the 
refugee camp than in israel qik said 
qiks 50yearold father mohammed and his brothers zakariyeh 
17 and nabil 16 also have stopped working in israel and are 
unemployed according to residents about half the 2000 
palestinians from arub once employed in israel no longer work there 
some raise chickens to survive the hard times and a few 
operations have become commercial with up to 1500 fowl 
abdel fatah khamis 22 said he used to sleep in tel aviv rather 
than make the 35mile trip home to arub but has gone home each 
night since the or yehuda fire 
parliament member amnon linn an arab affairs expert in the 
labor party said jewish violence against arabs was not widespread 
he called it the work of marginal groups on on the fringes of 
israeli society

michael dukakis denied allegations monday 
from a new york congressman that the democratic presidential 
nominee used college deferments to avoid combat in korea saying 
i served my country proudly 
dukakis attended swarthmore college from 195155 asking for and 
receiving deferments in 1952 1953 and 1954 he said he went to his 
draft board with several weeks of school left and asked to be 
drafted immediately 
dukakis served in the army for just under two years including 
16 months as part of a united nations contingent assigned to the 
demilitarized zone in korea the fighting ended in that country in 
july 1953 
i served my country i served my country proudly dukakis 
told reporters 
dukakis pointed out that he could have gotten additional 
deferments by enrolling in law school but asked to be drafted 
instead he was discharged in 1957 and attended harvard law school 
upon his return 
i was anxious to do my military service he said 
rep jerry solomon rny ranking gop member of the house 
veterans affairs committee called reporters to point out the 
deferments 
i just want to point out that dukakis received his first of 
three educational deferments eight months before the korean war 
ended solomon said in chicago where he was to receive an award 
from the veterans of foreign wars my point is not to point 
fingers at dukakis because what he did was legal but he avoided 
combat by using his education deferments theres nothing wrong 
with what he did because it was allowed 
the point is the press has made a big thing out of dan quayle 
joining the national guard but dan quayle stood a chance of 
being sent into combat while dukakis didnt solomon said we 
really ought to be putting this aside and get on with the 
seriousness of the campaign i dont think the campaign should be 
bogged down in this nonissue 
dukakis said his military background was common knowledge and he 
dismissed solomons criticism 
i dont think its a coincidence that a republican congressman 
raised it he said it will be up to the republican party to 
explain all this

the chubb corp wants to make sure this 
summers drought doesnt claim another victim along with parched 
crops the companys reputation 
stung by criticism that it backed away from drought insurance 
and left thousands of farmers high and doubly dry the warrenbased 
company has set up a crisis center mobilized phoneanswering 
troops for tollfree numbers and taken out newspaper ads 
theyre meeting this like meeting a natural catastrophe 
you set up a crisis center said gloria vogel who follows the 
company for the investment bank bear stearns amp co 
i think the company has done the best they can she said 
monday 
chubb has said applications for the insurance far exceeded the 
original 30 million in coverage it had authorized in response to 
the demand the company later increased the authorized amount to 
40 million 
chubb has paid about 20 million to farmers who applied for the 
coverage before the june 15 deadline but after the coverage limit 
had been reached chubb is the nations 16th largest property and 
casualty insurer with a net worth of 21 billion as of june 30 
management appointed a senior underwriting officer terry 
vangilder to handle the companys response to the complaints said 
spokeswoman mary lou korkuch who said she has spent a 
substantial amount of time on this question in the past two 
months 
the efforts are aimed at repairing the damage that may have 
been done to our reputation and really get back on track she 
said 
but to davenport iowa attorney terry m giebelstein who has 
sued chubb on behalf of 2000 iowa farmers the campaign doesnt 
address the fundamental issues the entitlement of the farmers to 
the policies 
chubb says that despite its authorization for only 30 million 
in insurance agents offered an estimated 400 million to nearly 
9000 farmers in ohio minnesota indiana iowa illinois 
kentucky michigan missouri tennessee and wisconsin 
the policies specify that chubb had to approve the applications 
before they were accepted the company said only 1160 were 
approved said ms korkuch 
farmers across the midwest have sued and a federal judge in 
cincinnati recently granted classaction status to one suit the 
others probaby will be consolidated there said giebelstein state 
insurance regulators also are examining the company 
but all may be sound and fury signifying nothing depending on 
the weather 
because the policies are pinned strictly to the cumulative 
amount of rain for a given area from june to aug 31 rain before 
the deadline could render the matter moot 
already enough rain has fallen recently to relieve the company 
of its obligation for about half the 40 million in coverage 
already granted said gail devlin chubbs senior vice president 
for finance 
well just have to wait until aug 31 and see how it shakes 
out giebelstein said when asked whether he would continue the 
legal action despite the rain if it rains enough its hard to 
complain

albanian leader ramiz alia said in a 
speech reported monday that yugoslavia is producing sinister 
propaganda in an attempt to blame its ethnic discord on albania 
in a speech sunday to a rally in peshkopia near the yugoslav 
border alia denounced criticism of ethnic albanians who live in 
the adjacent yugoslav province of kosovo the official albanian 
news agency ata said monday ethnic albanians make up nearly 90 
percent of kosovos population 
alia said the alleged yugoslav campaign has taken aim even at 
those few rights recognized in the yugoslav constitution 
the difficult problems yugoslavia is undergoing now are not 
solved and cannot be solved at the expense of the albanians alia 
said 
serbs and montenegrins in kosovo claim they are harassed by 
ethnic albanians at least 30000 held a rally saturday in 
titograd in montenegro near the albanian border to protest such 
harassment 
more than 30000 people have left kosovo since bloody riots in 
1981 when some ethnic albanians demanded greater autonomy 
official figures say most of those who left were serbs and 
montenegrins who claimed discrimination by the albanians 
last week an albanianlanguage daily in pristina the kosovo 
capital reported 9000 ethnic albanians also had left the province 
but said the reasons were economic rather than political kosovo is 
a rural province with much less development than the rest of 
yugoslavia

mayor sidney barthelemy disclosed monday that 
the city faces a 19 million budget deficit this year and said 
officials kept the shortfall secret to avoid negative publicity 
during the republican convention 
the mayor proposed a twoyear property service charge 
designed to raise 10 million to help bridge the gap voters have 
turned down two revenue raising proposals since barthelemy took 
office in 1986 but the mayor said he hopes a wave of good feeling 
that swept the city during the gop national convention would 
generate support for his proposal 
this last week was a spectacular week said the mayor i 
think people felt a sense of pride in the city 
if the city council approves the idea a proposal for a flat 
125 fee on properties would be put on the november ballot if 
approved the city would collect this years fee in december 
spending cuts and other adjustments also would be needed to 
balance the citys 280 million budget said kurt steiner the 
mayors chief administrative officer 
barthelemy said city officials realized in july there would be a 
shortfall after the louisiana legislature facing its own fiscal 
crisis cut funding for the city by 75 million city tax 
collections also are coming in below budget officials said 
but officials kept a lid on the news barthelemy said so as not 
to offset the good publicity the city was getting during last 
weeks convention 
i think the positive press that we would have gotten would 
have been countered by the city in crisis or the city faces a 
deficit barthelemy said 
barthelemy a democrat has been dealing with financial problems 
since taking office in 1986 he wiped out an impending 30 million 
deficit by laying off workers putting city employees on a fourday 
work week and shutting down city hall one day a week

prime minister sadek mahdi of sudan said 
monday a drop in the nile river water level would diminish flooding 
in three days but the critical time lies ahead early september 
when the rainy season peaks 
mahdi said foreign news media had exaggerated the effects of the 
floods his comments were carried by egypts official middle east 
news agency in a dispatch from khartoum capital of sudan 
he said the blue niles level at dima ethiopia about 530 miles 
southeast of khartoum fell by four inches monday and would be 
followed by a drop in the water level in sudan 
this means that however heavy the flood is today and 
tomorrow it will diminish in three days the agency quoted him 
as saying the time to be reassured about the nile flood is the 
first week of september 
torrential rains aug 45 caused flooding in northern eastern 
and central sudan that killed more than 90 people destroyed at 
least 150000 dwellings and left 15 million people homeless more 
than a third of khartoums nearly 4 million inhabitants 
health officials predict epidemics of waterborne diseases as 
people cut off from drinking water supplies are forced to drink 
from standing pools 
thousands of people already have developed diarrhea malaria and 
typhoid are on the rise and cholera is an imminent risk 
the last flood of similar magnitude was in 1946 but mahdi said 
his country was coping better this time he said foreign news 
reports potrayed a drowning sudan with spreading plagues and the 
first threat of locusts in a thousand years 
he acknowledged however that swarms of locusts are expected to 
invade sudan from neighboring chad and nigeria and will threaten 
five million acres of cultivated land he said the government had 
22 airplanes ready to spray affected areas and enough insecticides 
for 15 days 
sudan will fight the danger with assistance from friends 
he said

romania and the soviet union opened their files 
to the simon wiesenthal center to help track down pronazi war 
criminals now living in canada and america the centers canadian 
representative said monday 
sol littman who spent several weeks this summer in bucharest 
romania and vilnius lithuania said he has forwarded 44 names to 
the canadian justice departments war crimes unit and the office of 
special investigations in washington 
he said the names would not be released publicly until us and 
canadian authorities had time to investigate the allegations 
littman said the lists include 16 suspected members of the 
romanian iron guard who are thought to be living in michigan and 
elsewhere in the united states and seven believed to be in canada 
another 21 people are suspected of being lithuanian police 
militiamen iving in canada according to littman 
he said all the suspects are wanted in romania and the soviet 
union for war crimes including the murders of jews and other 
civilians lithuania a baltic republic was taken over by the 
soviet union during world war ii 
the los angelesbased simon weisenthal center is dedicated to 
tracking down nazi war criminals who have evaded arrest and help 
bringing them to trial 
littman canadas leading nazi hunter said the files showed 
many iron guard members were imprisoned after participating in 
revolts in 1939 and 1941 in unsuccessful efforts to overthrow 
romanias conservative government headed by ion antonescu 
he said nazis stationed in romania during world war ii helped 
them escape and many entered camps for displaced persons before 
making their way to canada the united states and argentina 
the wiesenthal center had reported in 1981 that some iron guard 
members were living in north america 
romania became a partner of nazi germany during world war ii and 
the wiesenthal report said frustrated by the romanian army 
which remained loyal to antonescu the iron guard turned on 
romanias jewish minority 
in one of the cruelest pogroms in history hundreds of jews in 
bucharest and jassy were beaten to death on the streets women and 
children mutilated and the bodies of victims hung in abattoirs on 
meat hooks 
rabbi marvin hier of the wiesenthal center said the former 
leader of the iron guard who he identified as horia sima is now 
living in spain 
these groups are still prevailing in the west continuing to 
preach the same fascist ideology and raising a second and third 
generation littman said 
he accused the canadian government of acting slowly in its 
investigation of suspected war criminals the wiesenthal center 
says canada has acted against only two alleged war criminals since 
legislation was passed last year permitting trials of the suspects 
in canada 
former hungarian police capt imre finta is awaiting a 
preliminary hearing in toronto on charges stemming from the 
deportation of jews in 1944 and the government is trying to deport 
jacob luitjens of the netherlands now an instructor at the 
university of british columbia who is accused of collaborating 
with the nazis 
the wiesenthal center has said as many as 6000 war criminals 
came to canada after world war ii a government commission reported 
last year that only 20 cases required urgent action and another 218 
were worthy of investigation

a panel of bishops will be appointed to 
study the reports of miracles at a charismatic church where three 
parishioners claim to receive messages from the virgin mary 
lubbocks bishop has announced 
about 12000 people gathered on the grounds of st john neumann 
catholic church on aug 15 to celebrate the feast of the 
assumption after the parishioners said mary told them miracles 
would occur on that day 
during the mass hundreds reported seeing apparitions of jesus 
and mary in the clouds while others claimed that the evening sun 
appeared to dance in the sky and that silvercolored rosaries 
turned a golden hue 
i am asking the national conference of catholic bishops to 
assist me in preparing an investigation of the event and a panel of 
specialists will be appointed shortly for this task lubbock 
bishop michael sheehan said in a statement issued late friday 
afternoon it was his first comment on the mass since the 
apparitions were reported 
sheehans secretary said he declined to speak to reporters 
a spokesman for the national conference of catholic bishops in 
washington said the organization has no involvement in the 
investigation he is free to set up his own investigation and ask 
experts in on his own but the national organization has nothing to 
do with that said joe lipovsky 
sheehan said he also has talked with an official from the office 
of pope john paul iis envoy to the united states an 
investigation of this kind is normal and the panel will be charged 
with studying the authenticity of the events the statement said 
the three parishioners say they began receiving messages from 
the virgin mary earlier this summer shortly after they returned 
from a pilgrimage to medugorje yugoslavia where six youths claim 
they have seen apparitions of mary since 1981 
hundreds have begun attending monday night rosary services in 
which mary constancio theresa werner and mike slate read aloud 
messages they claimed to have received

than 50000 copies have been distributed 
in his statement sheehan said he has asked st john neumann 
pastor monsignor joseph james not to promote or print the books 
until the investigation is concluded 
calls to james office monday for comment were not immediately 
returned 
sheehan said earlier that people shouldnt assume anything 
supernatural is happening at the church 
i take a cautious attitude about the rosary messages spoken 
about by several parishioners at st john neumann he said in 
july i neither encourage people to participate in the events nor 
do i discourage them

the republican convention boosted george bush to 
a narrow lead in the presidential race although many voters harbor 
doubts about sen dan quayle of indiana as his running mate a 
national poll said monday 
half the respondents in the cbs news survey said they did not 
believe quayle has the experience to be a good president and 
another 28 percent were unsure thirtynine percent said they 
wished bush chose someone else 
bush nonetheless led democratic nominee michael dukakis by 46 
percent to 40 percent in the poll of 1221 registered voters 
nationwide dukakis enjoying his own convention bounce had led by 
17 points early this month 
the survey was the first conducted entirely after the gop 
convention in new orleans ended thursday with a wellreceived 
speech by bush it found favorable views of bush and confidence in 
his leadership well up from their preconvention levels 
but voters expressed reservations about the qualifications and 
background of the 41yearold quayle who has faced a barrage of 
questions about his enrollment in the national guard during the 
height of the vietnam war 
fortynine percent of the respondents said phone calls made on 
behalf of quayle to the guard represented an unfair attempt to 
gain his admission 40 percent said such calls were acceptable and 
21 percent were unsure 
among the seven in 10 who had heard of the issue 48 percent 
said they believed quayle had joined the guard to avoid the draft 
just 29 percent believed that was not his main reason and 22 
percent said they didnt know 
also among those who had heard about it just 50 percent 
believed quayle was telling the truth about the national guard 
issue while 26 percent said he was not and 24 percent didnt know 
quayle also did not do well in comparison with the democratic 
nominee for vice president sen lloyd bentsen of texas fortyone 
percent said bentsen would be a better vice president to 28 
percent for quayle the rest didnt know 
bush received a mixed rating for his handling of quayles 
selection fortyseven percent rated it fair or poor 44 percent 
said good or excellent but twice as many said poor 18 percent 
as said excellent 9 percent 
still backing was up for the republican ticket as a whole the 
bushquayle ticket led by 10 points among men and roughly tied 
among women 4442 it led by 18 points among the youngest voters 
age 1829 among the oldest 64 and up the race was a 4141 tie 
the sixpoint spread in the race was just within the polls 
margin of error of plus or minus three points but several recent 
polls have shown bush gaining and dukakis dropping from his 
postdemocratic convention lead allowing the conclusion that the 
republicans lead slightly in a gallup poll this weekend they led 
by nine points 5142 
bush was expected to gain in popularity following the publicity 
from his convention just as dukakis did after the democratic 
convention such bounces in the polls generally settle as the 
campaign progresses 
on bushs personal ratings 51 percent in the new poll said they 
had faith in his ability to deal wisely with an international 
crisis while 37 percent would be uneasy his rating on this 
question in a cbs newsnew york times poll early this month was the 
precise opposite 
dukakis meanwhile did far worse on the confidence measure 53 
percent uneasy 29 percent confident 
bush was rated favorably by 39 percent and unfavorably by 25 
percent in the new survey much improved from his 
favorableunfavorable rating of 2733 in the previous poll still 
27 percent were undecided in their opinion of bush and 8 percent 
said they had not heard enough about him after his nearly eight 
years as vice president 
dukakis who came in for sharp criticism at the republican 
convention saw his favorableunfavorable rating drop from 3819 
before the gop convention to 3225 after it with 29 percent 
undecided and 13 percent saying they had not heard enough 
efforts by the republicans to paint dukakis as a liberal had 
little effect 34 percent saw him as a liberal compared with 35 
percent in the earlier poll but 34 percent said it was more likely 
dukakis would raise taxes up from 27 percent in early august 
bentsen was rated favorably by 21 percent and unfavorably by 12 
percent the rest hadnt heard enough or were undecided quayle 
scored 24 percent favorable to 18 percent unfavorable 
fortytwo percent said bentsen had enough experience to be 
president 23 percent said not and 35 percent werent sure for 
quayle just 22 percent said he had enough experience 50 percent 
said not and 28 percent were unsure 
asked if they were glad bush picked quayle 33 percent said they 
were 39 percent said they wished he chose someone else 12 percent 
volunteered that it didnt matter and 16 percent didnt know 
the poll was conducted friday through sunday

the united states is reducing the 
number of military air operations to be flown over the persian 
gulf but has made no decision to remove warships from the area 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday 
when a reporter said the soviet union had urged that the united 
states withdraw its naval forces from the gulf in view of the new 
ceasefire between iran and iraq fitzwater declined comment 
but he added 
we have said in the past that as the threat diminishes in the 
gulf so would our presence we are taking some actions at this 
time to allow certain activities that have been suspended in the 
past primarily things like port calls number of sorties flown off 
the carriers a few of those kinds of things are being changed to 
reflect a more relaxed atmosphere following the ceasefire but at 
this point there has been no decision to remove ships from the 
gulf 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said a decision was made over the weekend to fly fewer 
sorties and to make more port calls to allow sailors to rest since 
there is less need to patrol 
fitzwater said there had been no changes in the rules of 
engagement the standing operational orders given us military 
commanders 
pentagon spokesman lt col keith schneider said that since the 
ceasefire went into effect the situation in the gulf has 
stabilized and the number of operational requirements has been 
somewhat lessened 
he said sorties flown off navy aircraft carriers include both 
training exercises and missions to defend us units in the gulf 
against real or perceived threats 
the number of flights therefore fluctuates from day to day 
and as the threat to our forces in the gulf decreases the number 
of operational flights required would also diminish schneider 
said 
he also said that while the defense department has a policy 
against discussing ship schedules in advance if operational 
requirements for ships actively patrolling diminishes we will 
arrange additional port calls for rest and recreation for the 
crews

gravediggers in northern burundi have 
counted the bodies of about 5000 people massacred in battles 
between members of the hutu and tutsi tribes government officials 
said monday 
government and un officials in neighboring rwanda said at 
least 35000 burundians crossed the border into rwanda to escape 
the slaughter last week 
in washington the state department said no americans were in the 
areas of the killings 
foreign minister cyprien mbonimpa of burundi included the first 
official death toll in an official communique issued at a morning 
briefing for diplomats 
it also was read during the 1 pm newscast on government radio 
according to diplomats who spoke in telephone interviews from 
bujumbura capital of the small densely populated country in 
central africa they asked that their names not be used 
it said the people in charge of burying the bodies have 
counted approximately 5000 a western diplomat said but whether 
that was the total dead was not unknown immediately 
it appeared as if they had concluded their work but it was 
not at all clear he said the facts are very very unclear and 
sketchy because of the remoteness of the area 
he said there appeared to have been no major violence since 
about 24 hours after the fighting began aug 14 between the hutu 
burundis majority tribe and the tutsi the minority tribe that 
controls the military and government 
members of the hutu and tutsi tribes are old enemies after a 
coup attempt in 1972 in the former belgium colony the tutsi 
massacred 100000300000 hutu including most of the tribes 
intelligentsia according to human rights groups 
the news didnt start coming down to bujumbura until late 
tuesday and wednesday the diplomat said the army went in on 
tuesday and got things under control fairly quickly 
mbonimpa the foreign minister described a media report that at 
least 24000 people were killed as highly exaggerated another 
diplomat said and from every report including those from 
nongovernmental sources no one believes that figure 
neighboring rwandas state radio said monday that 35000 people 
had crossed the border 
rwanda and burundi former belgian colonies are among the 
worlds most densely populated countries rwandan officials said 
resources were being strained by the influx of refugees 
in brussels the european economic community and belgium said 
they would send a planeload of tents blankets and other emergency 
aid for the refugees worth the equivalent of more than 700000 
according to rwandas official radio monitored in nairobi 
officials of the neighboring country met sunday at the border town 
of butare where the refugees were gathered it gave no details 
burundi claims last weeks violence was caused by expatriate 
hutus who infiltrated northern burundi from foreign countries and 
incited hutus to massacre tutsis 
the hutu people liberation party an exiled opposition group 
accused the tutsidominated military of massacring thousands of 
hutus but diplomatic sources said there was no evidence of that 
more than 90 percent of the population is hutu in the northern 
area around the marangara and ntega rural communes where most of 
last weeks killings occurred 
burundis communique said the government had the situation under 
control and the military the ruling union of national progress 
party and the bureaucracy had been ordered to show restraint 
one of the diplomats said 
it said the policy of the government was one of respect for 
human rights and of ethnic reconciliation he reported 
maj pierre buyoyas government has restricted travel between 
towns and is not allowing trips into the north the diplomats said 
a 7 pm to 5 am curfew is in force throughout the country and 
meetings of more than five people are prohibited 
the tribal battles were the first significant violence reported 
in burundi since buyoya seized power in a bloodless coup sept 3 
1987 while thenpresident jeanbaptiste bagaza was abroad 
nearly 5 million people live in burundi which is about the size 
of maryland its population is 84 percent hutu and 15 percent 
tutsi roughly the same tribal proportions apply in rwanda which 
is slightly smaller than burundi

the fbi opened its defense monday in a 
discrimination trial by presenting four hours of statistics 
designed to show that hispanics are promoted as rapidly and 
disciplined as fairly as other fbi agents 
hispanics have no problem getting into management dr 
rebecca klemm an independent statistical consultant testified 
they get what they ask for in terms of promotions 
the 311 hispanic agents who joined in the classaction suit in 
us district court contend the fbi discriminates against hispanics 
in hiring promoting disciplining and assignments they want 
damages and changes in fbi policies about 400 of the bureaus 
9000 agents are hispanic 
during the first week of testimony about 40 fbi agents 
testified that hispanics are transferred more often to undesirable 
offices are given more assignments that are either less glamorous 
or more dangerous and receive less recognition for their successes 
the fbi opened the second week of the trial with ms klemm who 
disputed findings of dr gary lafree a sociologist at the 
university of new mexico lafree testified last week that hispanic 
fbi agents are less likely to hold higherlevel jobs 
ms klemm used the same raw numbers culled from the fbi as 
lafree but reached different conclusions lafree testified last 
week that 15 percent of hispanic fbi agents with at least five 
years of agency experience are managers compared with 21 percent 
of nonhispanic fbi agents with the same level of experience 
ms klemm testified that hispanics have done better headtohead 
against anglo agents when competing against them for promotions 
that 144 percent of hispanics got such promotions versus 105 
percent of anglo agents applying for the jobs 
she did not say how many people from each ethnic background 
applied for competitive promotions 
she said hispanics have an average of about two years less 
experience than their anglo counterparts when they attain the 
bottom rung of the management ladder in the fbi 
in terms of career advancement they advance timely she 
testified therefore even if they do different things as 
hispanic agents they do fine as far as advancement 
the suit was filed in january 1987 by bernardo matt perez 
who contends he was forced by superiors in washington los angeles 
and elsewhere to accept demotions he didnt deserve perez now the 
no 2 agent in el paso used to be in charge of the san juan 
puerto rico office and was secondincommand in los angeles before 
his transfer to el paso 
the nonjury trial is expected to end friday and us district 
judge lucius bunton is expected to reach a decision within six 
months federal employees are not entitled to jury trials when 
suing the government in discrimination cases 
hispanic activists have said a multitude of discrimination 
trials could result if the plaintiffs win hugo rodriguez a former 
fbi agent and the cocounsel for the plaintiffs has compared the 
case to those fought by blacks in the 60s and by women in the 70s

the aflcio said monday it will petition the 
reagan administration to restrict polish exports to us markets 
under provisions in the new trade bill that are designed to 
safeguard workers rights 
we certainly believe the worker rights provisions of the trade 
legislation should be applied in the case of poland said aflcio 
president lane kirkland they should be denied access to the 
american market under those provisions since they are in violation 
of worker rights 
kirkland made the comments on monday as the polish government 
ordered troops to secure major industrial plants and clamped 
curfews on three provinces hit by prosolidarity strikes following 
a week of the worst labor unrest since 1981 
the trade bill reagan is to sign tuesday in a ceremony before 
long beach calif dockworkers includes a provision permitting the 
us trade representative to retaliate against countries that deny 
worker rights such as recognition of free trade unions 
kirkland said he was told by the polish embassy here last week 
that his request for a visa to visit the country had been turned 
down for a third time 
the united states last year imported some 2615 million in 
products from poland primarily canned meat fish plates of iron 
steel nails clothing and glassware 
aflcio officials said the retaliation that the federation would 
seek from the reagan administration could take several forms 
including revoking polands mostfavorednation status as a trading 
partner 
the reagan administration revoked that status in 1981 upon the 
imposition of martial law in poland but gradually restored it with 
the aflcios approval after martial law was ended 
revocation of mostfavored status would raise the us tariffs 
on imports from poland for canned pork as an example the tariff 
would jump from a penny a pound to 325 cents a pound the tariff 
on cast iron pipes would jump from 8 percent to 25 percent 
also monday the aflcio elected new teamsters president william 
mccarthy as a vice president of the federation and to a seat on its 
policysetting executive council 
mccarthy fills the vacancy on the 35member board left by the 
death last month of his predecessor at the teamsters helm jackie

the government on monday ordered troops to 
secure major industrial plants and clamped curfews on three 
provinces hit by prosolidarity strikes following a week of the 
worst labor unrest since 1981 
the illegal strikes raised a specter of anarchy over poland 
and were a glaring violation of peace and order said interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak 
the army general appearing in uniform on national television 
said it was the duty of polands leaders not to allow the country 
to return to the situation before dec 13 1981 the date that 
martial law was imposed to suppress the outlawed trade union 
federation solidarity 
kiszczak also commander of the nations police forces said it 
was his duty as interior minister to assure elementary 
discipline 
even before he spoke strike organizers said riot police stormed 
two strikebound streetcar depots in szczecin and a bus depot near 
the city evicting the workers and detaining at least 150 of them 
in the first police action in the week of labor unrest 
in addition to authorizing curfews in the provinces of szczecin 
katowice and gdansk kiszczak said he ordered law enforcement 
forces to strengthen external protection around factories and 
to prevent outsiders from being present in the plants 
kiszczak said the army was asked to allot troops to assure the 
continuity of city transport everywhere it has been immobilized 
and misdemeanor courts were advised to jail violators in summary 
proceedings rather than merely fining them 
katowice is the southern province where miners in polands 
silesian coal fields have been striking for a week for higher pay 
and recognition of solidarity hundreds of workers at the lenin 
shipyard in gdansk the birthplace of solidarity joined the 
strikes monday seizing the main gate of the facility chanting the 
name of the banned union and waving polish flags 
kiszczak said the strikes were being carried out by only a 
minority of workers at the affected plants but had dire 
consequences for the economy 
sitin strikes were in effect monday in 13 state enterprises 
employing more than 90000 workers 
depending on further developments of the situation we shall 
reach for appropriate measures which are available within the 
existing law kiszczak said speaking in deliberate tones for 
between five and 10 minutes and making no mention of the police 
raid in szczecin 
wroclaw opposition leader jozef pinior said after hearing the 
speech on television that the authorities may succeed in 
pacifying the strikers now but the wave of strikes will return in 
one two or three months 
romuald ziolkowski chairman of the strike committee at the 
dabie bus depot in szczecin said that during the raid the riot 
police were throwing strikers into police vans like pigs 
there was crying and screaming there he added 
raids also occurred at streetcar stations and at the bus depot 
in police a city outside of szczecin about 7 pm ziolkowski 
said 
about 100 people were at each of the three depots and 5070 
people were detained at each site he said the strikers were 
greatly outnumbered and they resisted passively he said 
without elaborating 
before the police action in szczecin authorities had detained 
at least 10 people nationwide and threatened criminal charges 
against strike organizers 
we must fight for reforms we must fight for solidarity there 
is no other way solidarity leader lech walesa told a crowd of 
young workers at the 10000worker lenin shipyard the shipyard has 
been in ailing financial shape and is under threat of closure but 
has symbolic importance as the birthplace of the solidarity trade 
union eight years ago 
the ongoing strikes at 10 coal mines were costing the country 
13 million a day the government said coal exports are a major 
source of hard currency to repay polands daunting 39 billion 
foreign debt the biggest in the east bloc 
some gdansk port workers also began striking monday according 
to western journalists in the city a solidarity spokesman jacek 
kuron said 3000 dockworkers in the city were on strike 
although the shipyard strike had been announced in advance 
police did not interfere as workers marched around the sprawling 
yard bearing polish national flags and took over the main gate at 
835 am 
later in the morning riot police moved in to cordon off 
approaches to the yard 
in scenes reminiscent of a nineday strike at the shipyard in 
may that ended without a settlement strikers chanted solidarity 
slogans and posted banners on the shipyard fence helping some 
supporters who had been locked out to scramble over the gate 
shortly after walesa arrived in a red compact car and rallied 
the strikers 
everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike 
walesa said later by telephone from his home in gdansk 
walesa was spending the night in the lenin shipyard with about 
1000 strikers said union adviser adam michnik sources said 
police allowed walesa because of his stature to reenter the 
plant after the cordon was in place 
in the phone interview from his home walesa blamed the strikes 
on authorities whom he said have refused to engage in dialogue 
with workers 
i wanted to avoid strikes he said we shouldnt be 
striking we should be working but there was no other choice 
we are still waiting for serious talks 
none of the shipyards towering cranes appeared to be operating 
and a foreman speaking through a fence said all departments were 
shut down 
workers could be seen strolling taking naps or perching on 
fences and walls around the yard 
if you work only eight hours a day you make 40000 zlotys 
89 a month and thats not enough to make a living said one 
man in his mid20s 
opposition groups reported at least 10 instances of unrest at 
various factories around the country monday 
activists in warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the 
14000worker ursus tractor plant outside the capital police 
dispersed a morning rally at the plant and detained three people 
activist maciej jankowski said 
a management spokesman at ursus confirmed an unsuccessful 
attempt to strike at the plant but made no mention of police and 
said work continued normally 
in southeastern poland solidarity organizer ewa kuberna said 
workers rallied at the 18000employee stalowa wola steel mill and 
heavy machinery plant and a strike was launched by 2000 of the 
workers 
opposition spokesman wojciech maziarski also reported new 
strikes or partial strikes at the cegielski turbine works in 
poznan the huta warszawa steel mill in warsaw and the railroad 
construction enterprise of szczecin 
government spokesman ryszard straus said he had no information 
about any stoppages at cegielski or the szczecin railroad 
enterprise

the death of the shiite moslems most revered saint imam hussein 
in a clear reference to islamic jihad the group that holds at 
least two american hostages tufaili said 
i turn to those holding the prisoners foreign captives in 
lebanon although we do not accept to hold the hostages i tell 
them adhere to your demands do not let go of them or retreat 
until death 
demands made by islamic jihad or islamic holy war include 
release of prisoners form arab and foreign prisons release of 
lebanese and palestinians from israeli jails and withdrawal of 
israeli troops from south lebanon it has specifically demanded 
freedom for 17 shiites imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us 
and french embassies there in 1983 
hezbollah or party of god has irans support and is widely 
believed to be the umbrella organization for shiite extremist 
groups holding most of the 18 foreigners missing in lebanon who 
include nine americans held longest is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
tufaili closed his remarks by declaring to hostage holders 
you must protect them the demands by all means listeners in 
the ancient city of baalbek beat their chests with fists and 
chanted god is great 
hussein the shiites martyr and a group of his followers were 
massacred in 680 in what is now the iraqi province of karbala in a 
leadership fight between moslem factions moslems subsequently 
formed the shiite and sunni sects of the faith 
other parades and observances were held monday in beiruts 
southern slums and in south lebanon where thousands of shiites 
slashed their heads with razors or beat themselves with swords 
axes or iron bars blood dripped from the faces and chests of men 
and children as they reenacted the killing of hussein

mosque the hostages who include nine americans are widely 
believed held in hezbollahs hay madi barracks building about 10 
blocks from the mosque

but accused the united states and europe of trying to snatch our 
natural resources and then claim them as theirs 
when we say death to america we mean death to the aggressive 
policy of america death to the colonial policy of america and not 
death to the people of america fadlallah said 
we are open to the american people mostly to the oppressed 
blacks who are being treated as secondclass citizens he added

hundreds of women and girls clad in black chadors that covered

a former dean at the indiana university 
school of law said monday he was confident dan quayle received no 
special consideration when he gained admittance to the school in 
1970 
id bet a dollar against a doughnut there was nothing unusual 
or irregular about his admission to law school said prof 
william f harvey the dean from 1973 to 1979 
i was familiar with admissions during the 70s and am 
confident if there had been something wrong i would have known 
about it harvey said 
quayles father meanwhile also challenged allegations that 
family influence helped his son gain admittance to the law school 
or secure a state job 
harvey who taught the 41yearold republican vice presidential 
nomineee during his last year of law school described him as a 
very solid student 
i remember him well enough to say without reservation that he 
is not a lightweight or superficial harvey said i had a high 
regard for him he was a very hard worker gave excellent 
recitations and had a very keen perception of the law 
harvey made his comments shortly after current deans of the law 
school said at a news conference in indianapolis that school policy 
prohibited them from making public any confidential information 
related to quayles admission to the school 
associate dean g kent frandsen who is acting dean in the 
temporary absence of dean norman lefstein had huddled with other 
top administrators at the law school all day monday figuring out 
how to reply to press inquiries about quayle said charlotte 
wright spokeswoman for the law school news bureau 
a report published sunday in the plain dealer in cleveland 
alleged that quayle did not meet the admissions requirements for 
the law school but gained entrance after meeting with the 
admissions dean a republican judge in a city where quayles family 
owned the local newspaper 
the candidates father denied that charge 
what people are trying to say is that danny got his way paid 
in to law school said james c quayle theyre trying to 
build him up like an aristocrat and then tear him down 
the elder quayle publisher of the huntington heraldpress said 
there was no truth to accusations that his son was admitted to the 
law school with the help of his maternal grandfather eugene c 
pulliam publisher of several newspapers in indiana and arizona 
mr pulliam was a great philanthropist and he gave money all 
the time to lots of schools in indiana as well as to zoos and 
hospitals quayle said but id risk my arm on the fact he 
never gave money to the law school his interest was in journalism 
and getting better journalists 
quayle described himself as the proverbial c student during 
an interview monday on abctvs good morning america but said 
that his family played no role in his admission to law school 
what danny did is he went down and talked somebody at the 
indianapolis law school and pointed out that he went to a private 
school the elder quayle said of his son who graduated in 1969 
from depauw university a small liberal arts college in greencastle 
quayle in a telephone interview conceded that his son hadnt 
put his academic skills together while at depauw 
he was no mensa but it was his thought that he probably got a 
better education because they had much smaller classrooms and the 
curriculum was defined for them quayle said somehow he 
convinced them 
the young quayles personality also helped gain him a spot in 
1970 on the staff of attorney general theodore l sendak according 
to medford s evans who was instrumental in directing the aspiring 
lawyer to the statehouse job 
i think he probably got himself hired in the interviews 
said evans a former editor political columnist and editor at the 
pulliam family owned indianapolis news danny quayle was an 
impressive young kid 
i would guess they sendaks staff would take a look at 
academic records but i think they would be influenced also by how 
he handles himself evans said this is an office that dealt 
with the public 
evans who now is a staff member of the washingtonbased 
national journalism center denied that family members pulled 
strings for the indiana senator who worked his way through law 
school 
if the quayle family had been that thick with the state 
government there would not have been any reason to contact me 
said evans who contacted sendaks office on behalf of quayle who 
was then 22 
quayles father also disputed that the family is enormously 
influential in indiana as has been widely reported 
people keep saying quayle is from a prominent family but i 
tell you we run a paper with 9500 readers that doesnt carry a 
lot of weight the elder quayle said 
i like my new prominence said the senior quayle the only 
thing is i cant find the wealth

eroded the purchasing power of workers 
most argentine unions belong to the federation its 11 previous 
general strikes have been peaceful and fairly successful shutting 
down government offices and public transportation although private 
businesses have remained open 
the cost of living rose 178 percent during the first seven 
months of this year after it increased 256 percent in july 
alfonsin devalued the austral by 114 percent against the dollar 
implemented budget cuts and instituted a system of voluntary price 
controls 
wages have not kept pace with inflation and prices continue 
rising despite voluntary controls 
the labor federation has demanded an increase in the minimum 
monthly wage from the current 66 to 121 the federation on 
friday rejected the governments offer to boost the minimum wage to 
79 
alfonsin is asking the international monetary fund for 12 
billion and the success of his economic recovery plan is a key 
issue in the may presidential and legislative elections argentina 
has a 56 billion foreign debt 
half of the 254 seats in the house of deputies and about 
onethird of the 46 seats in the senate will be up for election in

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush are delving into the 92 million taxpayerfunded trough for 
the general election with dukakis getting to his share first 
dukakis got a headstart on bush by receiving his partys 
nomination almost a month before the republicans formally picked 
bush last week 
that meant he got his 461 million from the federal treasury 
earlier and has already spent 18 million according to july 
financial reports available monday at the federal election 
commission 
bush however has wasted no time in laying the groundwork for 
his general election campaign he had borrowed money against the 
461 million he stood to receive once he became the official 
nominee 
bush had spent 672570 on his general election effort as of the 
end of july his financial report shows he borrowed money he 
raised during the primary campaign for his compliance fund 
used for expenses to comply with election law administrative 
requirements 
unlike the primary campaign the candidates do not have to raise 
money privately for the general election they receive 461 
million from the federal fund that is supported by the voluntary 1 
checkoff on individual tax returns 
as the general election campaign gets under way the candidates 
have invested heavily in polling and in media production for ads 
that will be used between now and november 
dukakis invested more than 300000 in polling last month 
bush has been spending more money getting ready for the tv wars 
paying more than 127000 during july for media production and 
consulting to the firm of his media consultant roger ailes 
in addition to what the candidates are allotted the republican 
and democratic party organizations can spend 83 million each to 
help elect their nominees the limit applies to direct spending 
but the parties also have devised other ways to indirectly help 
their tickets through use of socalled soft money for generic 
party activity those efforts will result in spending many times 
the limit on direct party support 
dukakis closed out the last month of his primary campaign having 
spent 217 million against the federally imposed 23 million limit 
on primary spending his reports showed he still owed 469000 in 
outstanding bills and his campaign committee was owed nearly that 
much in receiveables 
bush who was scrimping to keep from topping the limit by the 
end of the campaign was up to 226 million against the 23 
million cap at the end of july he was owed 255183 and had 
61446 in debts

young people in the united states are living 
at home longer marrying later and taking more time to become 
selfsufficient according to a government report released monday 
assistant education secretary chester e finn jr said the study 
of youth aged 14 to 24 indicates they are staying younger 
longer 
they seem to be becoming autonomous selfsupporting 
individuals at a slower rate than was once the case finn said 
the report titled youth indicators trends in the wellbeing 
of american youth was compiled from information that had been 
collected since 1950 at federal agencies and private organizations 
finn said the figures show young people are living with their 
parents longer and they are slower to form their own families 
a number of indicators suggest that the transition from 
childhood to adulthood is taking longer and presenting more 
pitfalls than was the case several years ago the study said 
youths in the 20s are living at home measurably longer since 
1970 they have been delaying marriage to significantly later ages 
and since 1980 they have found their average earnings declining 
while those of older workers have increased 
among the findings 
the share of youth aged 18 to 24 who lived with their parents 
or in college dormitories rose from 43 percent in 1960 to 536 
percent in 1985 
the number of first marriages per 1000 nevermarried women 
aged 20 to 24 fell from 2201 in 1970 to 1044 in 1984 
median income for women aged 20 to 24 fell from 12517 in 
1980 to 12192 in 1986 using constant 1986 dollars the 
comparable figures for young men fell from 16113 in 1970 to 
14152 in 1986 
the study said the trends may be related since late marriage 
is a reasonable response to lower earnings living with parents is 
a reasonable arrangement for those not earning enough to support 
themselves 
finn said the report also showed falling scores on college 
entrance examinations and a lastplace ranking for us students in 
recent international science and mathematics tests raising concern 
about how the youth will fare in the future 
compared to kids elsewhere in the world they are performing 
poorly on all kinds of tests and that makes me worry he said 
they make me worry about the future of a country thats raising 
up people with a number of years in school but that dont know 
anything

current soviet culture is 
chaotic and the reforms of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
resemble those in czechoslovakia before the warsaw pact invasion of 
1968 a czechoslovak educator has written 
eva fojtikova head of the russian department at pragues 
charles university and the wife of the czechoslovak communist 
partys chief ideologist jan fojtik took a critical view of 
current soviet reforms in an article published friday in the 
cultural weekly kmen 
her views of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness on 
selected subjects come at a time when czechoslovakia is trying to 
find its own way toward greater openness democracy and economic 
restructuring 
fojtik who was elected full member of the ruling politburo in 
april is expected to chair a communist party plenary session on 
ideology sometime next month 
the present state of soviet culture is very chaotic said 
the article by mrs fojtikova there is a marked effort of 
newspaper journalism to suppress moderate opinions all efforts to 
guard and not betray the indisputable values created as a result of 
the revolution and socialist construction 
she added it is not progress to substitute one cult lie with 
another lie another onesidedness with all due criticism of 
soviet dictator josef stalin let us not forget that the cult is 
not created by one person alone 
stalins brutal regime has come under sharply increased public 
condemnation under gorbachev 
we know from experience that idols are knocked down mostly to 
make room for new idols the article said 
the article also drew an apparent parallel between 
czechoslovakia prior to the 1968 sovietled invasion and the soviet 
union today warsaw pact forces invaded czechoslovakia after a 
series of reforms that came to known as the prague spring 
it is not possible to forget that in the soviet union people 
did not live through a period of hungarian czechoslovak or polish 
counterrevolution and have no direct experience with it 
therefore many illusions persist and all the greater is the 
danger

a group of miners filed a 1 billion 
lawsuit monday against the united mine workers and its leadership 
charging that the miners were prevented from recovering wages lost 
during a 3year strike 
the lawsuit filed in us district court contended that the 
union did not represent them properly and discriminated against 
them because they refused to take part in picketline violence 
defendants included umw president rich trumka his vice 
president cecil roberts and secretarytreasurer john banovick 
the suit accused them of conspiring to keep the 406 plaintiffs from 
collecting benefits to which they should have been entitled 
in washington dc union spokesman joseph corcoran said late 
monday that the unions legal department had not yet seen the 
lawsuit 
but corcoran said the union is very confident that that 
settlement will be upheld in any court 
jerry hammond a spokesman for the socalled forgotten 400 
said the suit stemmed from an agreement reached in may between the 
umw and two at massey coal co subsidiaries to end selective 
strikes launched against two eastern kentucky mines in 1984 
the agreement requiring payment of 447 million to the union 
also settled a lawsuit challenging masseys decision to turn the 
leslie and mcinnes mines at sidney ky into nonunion operations 
about 700 miners including hammond worked at the two mines 
until february 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off 
the remaining miners lost their jobs sept 30 1984 the day before 
the two mines were sold to sidney coal co a subsidiary of ora mae 
coal co an operation owned by massey 
after the agreement was announced roberts said the 447 
million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among some 250 
miners who had been on selective strikes with each receiving 
about 18000 
hammond said the lawsuit contends that the umw breached its duty 
of fair representation by limiting the number of members who would 
receive payments the plaintiffs also contend they have been 
excluded from union meetings thus violating the organizations 
constitution 
the lawsuit asks for a jury trial plus 500 million in 
compensatory and 500 million in punitive damages 
trumka pushed for the unions use of selective strikes and on 
oct 1 1984 massey coal co became the first target after the 
company refused to sign the unions national coal wage contract 
signing would have given masseys laidoff employees companywide 
reemployment rights 
the union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in 
december 1985 when massey agreed to settlement of an unfair labor 
practice charge but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries 
continued until may

eurotunnel the anglofrench consortium set up to 
build a 31mile rail tunnel between france and britain confirmed 
on monday that the project is running well behind schedule 
eurotunnel issued a formal warning to transmanchelink about its 
likely failure to meet several constuction targets 
transmanchelink is a joint venture of british and french 
construction companies which has the contract to design and build 
the tunnel by may 1993 
transmanchelink declined to comment on the delays in the tunnel 
project 
eurotunnel warned that transmanchelink could face fines if it 
does not speed up the rate of tunneling 
a eurotunnel spokesman who was not identified in accordance 
with british custom said transmanchelink is not yet managing 
the tunneling program to our satisfaction 
tunneling on the british side is at about half the rate targeted 
in the contract eurotunnel said 
transmanchelink has bored only 11 miles of one tunnel against 
the 24 miles due by early last week the link is to have three 
tunnels 
the rate of tunneling is running at about 380 feet a week 
compared with a target of 660 feet a week 
tunneling on the french side also is behind schedule eurotunnel 
said 
project delays could affect banks willingness to inject funds 
into the project said richard hannah an analyst at the brokerage 
phillips and drew 
so far the tunnel work has been financed with funds raised 
through the sale of 13 billion worth of stock in the consortium 
once those funds have been exhausted eurotunnel can draw on an 
85 billion loan signed last november with a syndicate of 
commercial banks 
but the banks have to be satisfied that sufficient progress on 
the project has been made before they commit any money hannah said 
they will have a very hard look at the project before putting 
any money in he added 
the first drawdown of the bank financing is due in october 
hannah said 
eurotunnel units which are made up of one share in eurotunnel 
plc and one in eurotunnel sa were off 12 pence 20 cents at 313 
pence 529 on londons stock exchange by late monday afternoon

leaders are linked to marxistled guerrillas announced monday it 
will participate in the march presidential elections 
leftist parties have boycotted elections since civil war began 
in late 1979 they said their security could not be guaranteed and 
that elections formed part of a usdirected counterinsurgency 
plan 
in the past the christian democratic government of president 
jose napoleon duarte has invited leftist political leaders to 
participate in elections but asked the guerrillas to lay down their 
arms 
the democratic convergence a coalition of three leftofcenter 
parties said monday it will choose its candidates in coming weeks 
the coalition includes the national revolutionary movement the 
popular social christian movement and the social democratic party 
guillermo ungo leader of the national revolutionary movement 
and ruben zamora chief of the popular social christian movement 
are the president and vicepresident respectively of the 
democratic revolutionary front

marti national liberation front the guerrilla army battling the 
usbacked government 
an estimated 65000 people mostly civilians have died in the 
civil war 
the guerrillas condemned previous elections as farces but 
leftist civilian politicians recently said guerrilla leaders 
understand their decision to take part in the march elections 
our objective in the electoral process is the promotion of a 
political and negotiated solution to the armed conflict as an 
indispensable condition for fulfilling the salvadoran peoples most 
pressing demands a communique issued by the convergence said 
the upcoming elections will not in themselves resolve the 
fundamental problems of our society but we are convinced that 
our participation will bind and mobilize people around the 
objectives of social justice democracy national independence and 
peace 
the election is likely to be a close contest between el 
salvadors two dominant parties the incumbent christian democrats 
and the conservative republican nationalist alliance 
the alliance known as arena gained control of the legislature 
and twothirds of the countrys municipal governments in elections 
held in march 
duarte has been diagnosed as having terminal liver cancer

faced with a third straight summer of 
low rainfall officials ordered most of the towns 4500 residents 
and businesses to cut water use by 20 percent monday 
the gut of the problem is we havent gotten any rain city 
manager ben shivar told a news conference if we had gotten the 
kind of showers that fell this weekend in sanford and greensboro 
we would have substantially reduced our problem shivar said 
referring to two other central north carolina cities 
the main reservoir supplying this town 50 miles west of raleigh 
is more than six feet below its normal level reducing the 
available water supply to about 44 percent of normal shivar said 
if customers continue to use water at the current rate of about 
22 million gallons a day without substantial rainfall the city 
could run out of water in about 41 days shivar said 
mayor earl b fitts order monday mandates a water allocation 
system requiring residents and most businesses to cut water use by 
20 percent immediately the order requires two large poultry 
producers townsend foods and midstate farms to reduce water 
consumption by 30 percent 
shivar said the two poultry companies which employ about 500 
people use about 42 percent of the citys water supply 
voluntary conservation measures have reduced daily consumption 
to just less than 22 million gallons from about 247 million 
gallons shivar said mondays order is designed to reduce daily 
usage by an additional 300000 gallons anyone found violating the 
order a third time could be penalized with fines and termination of 
service 
residents could face stricter restrictions in the coming weeks 
unless consumers cooperate shivar said 
we might not be able to avoid layoffs he said so far no 
businesses have had to cut back on production because of the water 
crisis he added

vice president george bush on monday defended his besieged 
running mate sen dan quayle as a patriot who served honorably in 
the national guard and at least did not go to canada to avoid 
the vietnam war 
and quayle told a veterans group in a hastily arranged speech 
that he pulled no strings to get into the indiana national guard 
because his unit had openings before i applied they had openings 
when i applied and they had openings after i applied 
my national guard unit was never called up to active duty but 
let me say that after these last 72 hours no one can say ive never 
faced combat quayle told 2500 whistling and cheering members of 
the veterans of foreign wars 
bush spoke earlier to the vfw convention in chicago strongly 
defending his running mate he said after his appearance that he 
wants to speak out for quayle because i want to get that 
campaign focus where it belongs which is bushdukakis and 
thats what i tried to do 
the republican national convention boosted bush to a narrow lead 
over massachusetts gov michael dukakis 4640 according to a cbs 
news poll released monday the same poll however revealed serious 
reservations about the quayle choice as a running mate 
half the respondents in the survey said they did not believe 
quayle has the experience to be a good president and another 28 
percent were unsure thirtynine percent said they wished bush 
chose someone else 
the poll of 1221 registered voters was conducted friday through 
sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus three points 
dukakis campaigning in massachusetts before an evening national 
security briefing referred to the quayle controversy in the 
context of who americans would want to be a heartbeat away from 
the presidency democrat lloyd bentsen or quayle 
bush in his speech recalled his own record as a bomber pilot 
in world war ii and said he had strong feelings for those who 
fought in the rice paddies of vietnam 
i hardly ever walk by the vietnam veterans memorial in 
washington when i dont get a lump in my throat or a tear in my 
eye he said but many others served too some in the army 
reserve some in the national guard people who were not sent 
overseas like quayle 
true he didnt go to vietnam but his unit wasnt sent 
bush said but theres another truth he did not go to canada he 
did not burn his draft card and he damned sure didnt burn the 
american flag and im proud to have him at my side 
the vice president said his running mate was the victim of 
shrill partisan attack he also charged dukakis with wanting 
unilateral cuts in our defense 
if the united states had embraced the nuclear freeze movement 
as dukakis had it would have locked in soviet superiority in a 
range of strategic areas he said 
dukakis told reporters in lowell mass that quayles 
qualifications obviously would be an issue to voters 
how we make our decisions how we make the presidential 
selections who we select whether or not that person should be 
a heartbeat away from the presidency obviously will be an an issue 
in the campaign dukakis said 
the democrats national security briefing was being given by cia 
director william webster and was secret said bentsen campaign 
spokesman mike mccurry the agency traditionally offers the 
briefing in every presidential campaign he said 
quayle appeared on some early morning television shows and later 
invited the press to take photographs in his office where he was 
asked if he was going to remain on the ticket 
im george bushs running mate he responded the flap about 
his national guard service would get behind us he said 
in his television interviews he reasserted that no rules were 
broken to get him into the guard when he joined in indiana in 
1969 
i got into the national guard fair and square and i dont 
believe anybody is alleging anything differently he said on 
abcs good morning america 
but somehow this whole national guard episode is being 
perceived that joining the national guard is something less than 
patriotic and i really take strong exception to that he said 
president reagan was vacationing in california where spokesman 
marlin fitzwater declined to comment on quayles national guard 
service 
asked whether the president believed quayle should be dropped 
from the ticket fitzwater said it is not a relevant question 
senator quayle is the vice presidential candidate and hes a 
good one he said 
the spokesman said reagan planned to make between eight and 15 
appearances all around the country on behalf of the ticket the 
president would draw distinctions between liberals and 
conservatives between democrats and republicans he said 
in illinois house minority leader bob michel rill said he 
thought it was too early to discuss dropping quayle from the ticket 
if there was something additional that came up that was a 
distraction or a disqualification well the options always 
there he said but i dont see it at this juncture 
im not going to call it a mistake yet he said

foreign minister jorge ritter on 
monday denied charges that panamanian forces are harassing us 
military personnel calling the allegations an escalation of a 
campaign to undermine the government 
ritter told a news conference us officials who accused the 
government of encouraging attacks on americans were seeking an 
excuse for new and more aggressive measures against panama 
us officials in panama said sunday that american personnel 
reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by panamanian 
officials this year ranging from extortion for traffic violations 
to the blocking of mail 
the panama defense forces rejected the allegations sunday night 
and said in a statement that american troops caused problems for 
panamanian authorities including fights mistreatment of women and 
shooting in public places 
the reagan administration has applied economic sanctions against 
panama in an effort to force the ouster of gen manuel antonio 
noriega commander of the defense forces and the countrys de facto 
ruler 
noriega is under us indictment in florida on drug trafficking 
and money laundering charges which he denies 
ritter said monday american officials made the allegations to 
make it appear that the us aggressors become the victims 
he reiterated panamanian charges that the united states was 
seeking a pretext to annul the 1977 panama canal treaties under 
which the united states is to hand over control of the canal to 
panama on dec 31 1999 
col rogelio alba copresident of a binational committee 
charged with the defense of the panama canal said that us 
southern command officials have shown a lack of respect in all 
things for us 
alba said weve gone out of the way to collaborate with them 
weve never interfered with them and theyre killing us with 
hunger referring to the us economic sanctions that have 
crippled panamas economy 
the new york times on sunday quoted us southern command state 
department and defense department officials as saying there have 
been an increasing number of beatings abductions rape and 
extortion of us military personnel and their dependents 
the story under a washington dateline said the us officials 
viewed the incidents as a campaign by the panamanian government to 
pressure the united states to lift sanctions 
but one southern command official said sunday the increased 
reports of harassment could be just an indication of individual 
frustration and anger 
washington imposed economic sanctions on panama in march after 
the noriega ousted president eric arturo delvalle delvalle has 
since been in hiding but the united states continues to recognize 
him as panamas legitimate president 
about 12000 us servicemen are stationed in panama by treaty 
to protect the panama canal they are attached to the southern 
command which oversees all us military operations south of the 
usmexico border

not serious and that the plane could have flown to spokane if the 
captain had chosen to do so though at a reduced altitude and speed 
andrews said the flaps on the planes wings failed to go back to 
their normal position after takeoff 
the incident was the second malfunction in the plane in three 
days andrews said 
during bushs trip to ohio over the weekend smoke entered the 
jets cabin as the aircraft landed at port columbus international 
airport airport officials said a hose came loose and allowed a 
small amount of smoke to leak but said the problem was minor the 
plane continued from columbus to cleveland on saturday without

the dan quayle dilemma revolving generally 
around questions of inexperience and privilege has ensnarled 
george bush at a critical moment and threatens the republican 
candidates appeal to the reagan democrats who helped make him 
what he is today 
the emerging image of quayle as an overindulged rich kid is not 
so much quayles problem as bushs the issues reflect as much on 
bushs judgment in 1988 as quayles judgment as a 22yearold in 
1969 
bush would rather be talking about his lword the brand of 
democratic liberalism he associates with george mcgovern jimmy 
carter ted kennedy and now michael dukakis but the quayle matter

after 34 years in power president 
alfredo stroessners colorado party is losing the loyalty of young 
people leaders say they are concerned but not alarmed 
the trend is most evident in the universities although no 
statistics are available to show the exact numbers of youths 
leaving or refusing to join the governing party 
student governments that formerly were staunchly prostroessner 
now are dominated by coalitions that challenge the government 
students also are forming new groups 
im a colorado by tradition not conviction because you have 
to be one to work as a public employee said a 20yearold law 
student who gave her name only as maria she added that she was 
fired from a government job for voting for an opposition slate of 
candidates for her student government 
there is no doubt that the colorado party has been losing 
influence among the young these days said sociologist jose 
nicolas morinigo 
the paraguayan federation of university students which 
education minister carlos ortiz ramirez describes as one more 
movement of irregular opposition to the government was set up 
last year and comprises more than a dozen member groups 
the colorado party claims 14 million members most of whom are 
younger than 29 and know no other president than stroessner who 
took power by coup in 1954 and has ruled ever since he is now 75 
years old 
the party after the armed forces is the strongest institution 
in this rural landlocked nation of 38 million people membership 
is required for all public employees and a prerequisite for 
benefits such as government scholarships 
desertions by youths and challenges by those who chart an 
independent course from within pose a thorny problem that colorado 
officials acknowlege they must address 
a priority next year is the recovery of the diverse student 
centers that are circumstantially in the hands of the opposition 
said mario abdo benitez the partys vice president and 
stroessners longtime private secretary 
we have made mistakes but we are trying to set them right and 
give a greater dynamism to our policies with the young said 
martin chiola a colorado congressman who is president of the 
partys committee on student affairs 
students along with the catholic church have called on the 
government to allow more civil rights and political liberties 
in may when pope john paul ii visited paraguay dozens of young 
people at a rally held up their arms shackled at the wrists with 
handkerchiefs to dramatize the lack of freedoms 
in july students boycotted classes at catholic university to 
protest the expulsion of the rev juan antonio de la vega a 
spanish jesuit priest who had lectured on liberation theology a 
social reform movement among clergymen 
thousands of youths were among the estimated 20000 people who 
in early august marched silently through the streets of the capital 
in a gesture of solidarity with the catholic church to which most 
paraguayans at least nominally belong 
the rev dionisio daeshague who helped organize 14000 youth 
volunteers for the papal visit said dissident or independent 
student groups could be a time bomb for the government all they 
need is someone to light the wick 
party leaders are concerned but not alarmed militant 
stroessner supporters won control of the party at its convention 
last year while that alienated some members it nevertheless 
demonstrated that stroessners power base remains strong 
some of the youth call for democracy but i dont know what 
kind of democracy they want and demand because i consider this a 
democracy said zoraida ramirez vice president of the 
governmentsanctioned colorado university student association 
we have peace we have progress with the government of 
president stroessner said ms ramirez a 24yearold economics 
student at national university one has to leave the country to 
fully appreciate the peace in which we live

clad in traditional arabian robes 
and headdress dr lawrence curtis sits in his study surrounded by 
the things he loves an extensive zoological library three snakes 
and a scorpion that paces in a small box 
every so often a curious ostrich peers through the window 
home for curtis is riyadhs zoo 
the 58yearold texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in 
this oilrich nation and sometime in the future he said saudi 
arabia may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced 
countries 
curtis spent 15 years as a zoo director in fort worth texas 
and another 15 in oklahoma city 
i was bored with conventional zoos he said and 18 months 
ago heard that riyadh was planning to open a zoo and needed a 
director he packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the 
saudi capital 
he was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare 
for the zoos opening in march 1987 
today the riyadh zoo is home to 1200 animals many of them 
endangered species it is also an oasis carpeted in lush grass and 
filled with flower beds bubbling manmade streams small trees 
and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil 
nearly 7000 visitors a day pass through its gates men on 
mondays wednesdays and fridays and veiled women on tuesdays 
thursdays and sundays in accordance with saudi arabias islamic 
tradition of separating the sexes 
to riyadhs residents the zoo is a welcome change of scenery 
to curtis the zoo is much more 
i really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation 
for conservation he said 
one of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to 
issue a policy statement supporting the convention of international 
trade in endangered species cites a treaty designed to protect 
wild animals in their native countries 
saudi arabia supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it 
a point curtis thinks will change soon but the expression of 
support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world 
to help stock the zoo 
in keeping with cites guidelines no endangered species were 
collected from the wild 
an arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from cincinnatis 
zoo pigmy hippos came from the bronx zoo in new york city boston 
sent antelopes miami cleveland and duke university sent lemurs 
san diego contributed a scimiter horned oryx and a golden lion 
marmoset came from washington dc 
the zoo in cairo egypt sent giant tortoises the singapore zoo 
a crocodile the sydney zoo in australia a kangaroo and two tapirs 
arrived from the zoo in lima peru 
bedouins the nomads who live in saudi arabias desert brought 
in lizards a caracal and a hyena in the back of pickup trucks 
and so it went until the zoos eclectic collection rivaled those 
of its more established counterparts 
weve got an indian mynah who speaks arabic and a parrot who 
speaks swahili said curtis hes next to a macaw from brazil 
and you know what they speak there portuguese we really have a 
multilingual zoo its like the united nations 
getting the animals to riyadh was only half the chore 
the big challenge was acclimatization curtis said we had 
to make a lot of modifications upon his arrival he was given a 
list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as 
inappropriate 
a wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space 
and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff 
expertise in handling them many animals need special care in order 
to thrive in riyadhs desert climate 
the key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems so 
we installed a lot of that curtis said the zoo also invested in 
shade cloth which cuts out 80 percent of sunlight in the summer 
months when temperatures often reach 122 degrees 
reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water 
like his charges curtis seems to have adapted to his new 
environment he wears the local robes and headdress known as a 
thobe and ghutra 
he takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph saudi 
arabias native fauna 
this country has made remarkable progress it has a big 
commitment to conservation curtis said theyve already 
created national parks theres an endangered species list and 
weve got endangered species legislation coming up

have you ever bought english tea thinking that the 
royal seal on the package means queen elizabeth ii drinks it 
brace yourself for a disappointment if you did the warrant 
doesnt guarantee that she does actually buckingham palace wont 
say what her majesty prefers 
does that matter asks hugh faulkner secretary of the royal 
warrant holders association the fact that she might not drink it 
is irrelevant that tea goes into buckingham palace 
nevertheless the economist magazine wrote recently such 
labels could mislead the unwary for two reasons a warrant 
holder can display the royal insignia on goods other than just 
those it supplies to a palace and warrants also go to companies 
supplying palace staff but not the royals themselves 
warrants are dispensed by the queen the queen mother prince 
philip or prince charles the warrants entitle holders to put a 
royal coat of arms on labels letterheads trucks and buildings 
along with the words by appointment to whichever royal has 
given the warrant 
the wording changes with the monarch 
royal worcester the maker of fine china got its warrant from 
king george iii 200 years ago and today is by appointment to 
queen elizabeth ii 
other countries surviving monarchs also grant warrants and in 
britain the practice is centuries old 
to win a warrant in britain a tradesman must have supplied the 
royal household regularly for three years and gotten paid by the 
royal family for his goods or services buckingham palace says 
various holders have more than one warrant but only about a 
dozen elite including harrods department store hold all four 
others like royal worcester take pride in the length of their 
service to the queen who grants the most warrants of the four 
entitled to 
the queens list is studded with luxury goods makers including 
12 jewelers and eight champagne sellers there also are bagpipe 
makers military outfitters suppliers of venison chimney sweeps 
shipping agents clock makers porcelain restorers purveyors of 
potted shrimp and sloe gin suppliers of gold and silver lace

theres even a seller of mopeds on the list 
more practical are suppliers who sell eggs and plastic bags and 
installers of intruder alarms something all the more necessary 
since july 1982 when a london eccentric broke into the queens 
bedroom and woke her up 
the lists do keep up with the times they contain for example 
more computer equipment makers than in the past 
about 10 to 40 warrants are granted a year they cost nothing 
a royal household tradesmens warrants committee decides once a 
year who should get a warrant from the queen or her son and heir 
prince charles subject to royal approval and announce the results 
in the london gazette the government bulletin queen mother 
elizabeth and prince philip consider applications throughout the 
year 
in olden times the granting of warrants was a more personal 
affair according to royal worcester it got its warrant from 
george iii after he happened by the porcelain works and was 
enchanted with the china 
the products dont have to be british but most are 
there are very few outsiders faulkner said 
british subsidiaries of foreign companies have won warrants 
including american ones like kellogg ibm heinz and the makers 
of johnsons wax 
when companies lose their warrants because they arent 
measuring up change hands or the palaces needs have changed 
they are simply omitted from the published list 
no official reason is given and no figures are available 
showing how many have been dropped 
but faulkner said people will notice 
does a warrant help sales 
yes it does said a royal worcester spokesman 
as youre aware in this country the royal family is very 
important people do take note of it 
cadbury schweppes says it displays royal arms on chocolate bars 
sold overseas 
faulkner said particularly in the japanese market and 
certainly in the american market it doesnt hurt 
on the question of the queens tea faulkner said i wouldnt 
make too much play of that particular angle the lovely thing about 
this is that peoples imaginations can run wild you dont want to 
disappoint them 
besides he said its not something youd bring up with the 
queen 
i think it would really be wrong it would be bloody bad 
manners to inquire what her personal likes and dislikes might 
be

over the next year italy will rid itself of a 
criminal code enacted by benito mussolinis fascist regime and 
strengthened by more recent emergency laws to fight political 
terrorism 
in its place parliament has adopted a new code and courtroom 
procedures that the government hopes will reflect italys postwar 
democracy 
to strengthen the rights of defendants the new laws demand 
judicial consent for arrest warrants severely restrict pretrial 
detention and require prosecutors to explain charges and show their 
evidence during a hearing shortly after an arrest 
we are finding that the code formed in 1942 under the fascists 
does not fit italys new democracy after the war said riccardo 
dalla vedova a rome defense lawyer who has studied the reforms 
under the old code some defendants awaiting trial languished in 
jail for as long as six years a prosecutor could order an arrest 
and the defense would not get a look at the evidence until after 
the investigation was complete sometimes shortly before trial 
the reforms also allow prosecutors to plea bargain to trade 
reduced charges or sentences for testimony that can convict crime 
bosses and terrorist masterminds 
another change abolishes the verdict of not guilty for lack of 
evidence the finding is short of complete innocence and leaves a 
cloud of suspicion over the defendants such as the three turks and 
three bulgarians acquitted of plotting to kill pope john paul ii in 
1981 
the new code will go into force gradually between now and 
october 1989 
it solves the problems of pretrial detention which i have to 
admit is one of the wickedest parts of our system said dalla 
vedova 
the detentions began in the 1970s when the state struggled to 
subdue growing political terrorism from both the far left and right 
with the kidnapping and killing of former premier aldo 
moro attacks at the very heart of the state we had to defend 
ourselves said dalla vedova 
but while the pretrial detention was created to cope with the 
violence lawyers and prosecutors agree that it came to be used 
even for minor crimes 
pretrial detention now is reserved for murder kidnapping and 
terrorism and prosecutors must convince a judge it is necessary 
prisoners awaiting trial can petition for their release 
dalla vedova and lawyers giorgio cherubini and quirino mancini 
said that in common law countries such as the united states the law 
evolves by precedent by supreme court decisions 
but in italy changes must be written into the law because 
judges are not bound by earlier high court opinions 
in italy a young judge can interpret a law in a completely 
different way than the supreme court interpreted it just 10 days 
before said dalla vedova 
italian media often refer to the new code as the perry mason 
system but erle stanley gardners fictitious lawyer could well 
be lost in italy where more than 90 percent of the trials are heard 
by a judge not a jury 
still the reforms will allow italian lawyers for the first time 
to directly question and crossexamine witnesses rather than 
suggesting their questions to the presiding judge 
prosecutors now must advise defendants of the charges and 
disclose their evidence to the defense during a pretrial hearing 
within 10 days of arrest evidence that had been kept secret until 
the end of an investigation now must be shared with the defense 
during a series of other pretrial hearings 
the reforms also curtail the powers of investigating 
magistrates who in the past gathered evidence determined whether 
to prosecute and ordered the arrest 
it is right that one changes and the quicker the better the 
musical score for the criminal trial that is out of tune with a 
state that wants to be truely democratic corrado carnevale a 
judge with the court of cassation italys highest criminal court 
told a recent conference on the new code 
as crime became more complicated and sophisticated and as the 
investigations became more intricate and involved italy created 
the maxitrial such as the mafia trial in palermo that had 476 
defendants 
it gave the government a way to deal with massive organized 
international crime 
the handicap is no human mind can absorb 476 positions and 
sort out all the evidence for and against said dalla vedova 
so now prosecutors can use plea bargaining to uncover new 
evidence and to help separate the trials of the principal 
defendants 
besides the new code italy has taken other measures to give its 
criminal justice system the image of fairness it has made judges 
liable for damages if they make errors by intent or gross 
negligence at the urging of socialist leader bettino craxi who 
considered the practice humiliating police also have been slower 
to clamp handcuffs on people they arrest 
another measure to be adopted will give journalists immunity 
from being required to reveal sources on crime stories and others 
seek to deal with the backlog in italian courts by depenalizing 
some offenses or making them subject only to fines

for a refreshing change try the longterm 
economic view 
it can relieve you of stress improve your disposition allow 
you to appreciate simple things like a good nights sleep and 
probably put a few dollars in your pocket too 
while your neighbors in the game of financial survival cast 
furtive glances over their shoulders your demeanor is carefree 
your smile and sturdy stride reflects not foolishness but 
confidence in your course 
all the bad news bounces off your hide interest rates the 
consumer price index the balance of payments deficit the budget 
deficit the decline of your particular stocks warnings of future 
financial horrors worry you not 
good riddance to the daily worries yours is the longterm view 
incredibly the longterm investment view has been almost 
forgotten over the past year although experience shows it is the 
only realistic way to view a portfolio investors have been caught 
instead in the game of trading 
traders try to outguess the market they are nearsighted so 
their view extends from a few hours to a few months they calculate 
the value of their investments daily they can see themselves as 
rich or poor in the same day 
it is a nervewracking mindboggling emotionjuggling 
experience made all the worse by the realization that there isnt 
a thing that can be done to overcome the forces affecting the 
investments it is helplessness 
in contrast the longrun view requires little activity of any 
sort it is easy on the nerves and while assurance of profit can 
never be accepted as a given there is a very good chance the 
longterm investor will win out 
its in the cards so to speak over the longterm economic 
booms and busts cancel out each other as do volatile swings in 
stock prices over time sound stocks move in line with fundamental 
equity values 
its in the records 
wright investors service calculated the annual rates of return 
for the stocks in the standard amp poors 500stock average for the 
past five years and found this 
dividend income of 37 percent and earnings growth of 84 
percent for an earned retuurn of 121 percent changes in the 
priceearnings ratio for the 500 stocks added another 21 percent 
for a total retuurn of 142 percent 
while five years often includes a complete cycle of bull and 
bear markets the latest fiveyear period is an exception but 
tracing the periods all the way back to 19291934 he found the 
annual return still came to 109 percent 
after examining this evidence wright projects that over the 
next five years to june 30 1993 we might reasonably expect an 
annual average of 35 percent dividend return and 77 percent 
earnings growth 
because current priceearnings ratios average somewhat higher 
than they have over the past 40 years wright projected no growth 
in this sector in fact he deducted 06 percent for a total 
annual return of 106 percent 
these returns are averages which means some quality stocks may 
perform even better perhaps doubling in the next fiveyear period 
but even if your stocks perform only to the average youd double 
your money in seven years 
seven years might seem like an age to those who have been 
focused on the next few weeks but it isnt for some of the most 
respected and successful investors they know they cant outguess 
the market but they understand also that time and a growing 
american economy are on their side 
in the longterm view what might seem mountainous obstacles get 
reduced to specks even bear markets terror of shorttermersare 
not feared in fact theyre considered opportunities by patient 
investors 
gerald perritt editor of investment horizons a newsletter 
offers this longterm advice 
do not be frightened by bear markets on the contrary since 
they present a rare opportunity to accumulate the shares of good 
companies at bargain prices you should view bear markets in a 
favorable light 
remember the only time you want stock prices to be at their 
peak is the day you plan to sell in the meantime you should be 
glad that the stock market periodically places its merchandise on 
sale

its been 60 years since australias 
legendary royal flying doctor service took to the air in the vast 
sunscorched interior known as the outback 
but these days its doctors are more likely to be treating 
typically urban problems such as alcoholism suicide and venereal 
disease than loneliness and broken bones of past days 
for doctors in the service making a house call can mean flying 
hundreds of miles 
australia is virtually the size of the united states distances 
are measured in hours traveled not miles schoolchildren in the 
arid outback are educated over bush radio because no schools are 
around for hundreds of miles 
but no matter where a patient is the royal flying doctor 
service boasts it is never more than two hours away once a call is 
made 
last year the networks 34 aircraft flew 4 million miles to 
transport 10295 patients and treat 88757 others 
now thats what you call a country practice said brian 
partridge spokesman for the service an organization that 
crisscrosses a landscape of about 2 million of australias nearly 3 
million square miles 
we provide a standard of health care that is equivalent to 
that enjoyed by people in the cities said partridge people 
assume that if you live in the country you are healthier that is 
not true 
alcoholism is very prevalent along with stressrelated 
disorders the suicide rate is very high 
the service celebrated its diamond jubilee in may still 
committed to providing the mantle of safety that the very rev 
john flynn a presbyterian missionary envisioned when air travel 
was in its infancy 
in the beginning the flying doctors attended women giving birth 
and mended broken bones of cattlemen who fell off their horses 
now weve also got to deal with tourists as well as 
prospectors anthropologists archaeologists and surveyors 
partridge said 
we still get the old type of problems but were having to 
attend a growing number of road accidents as well as suicide 
attempts aborigines account for nearly half the people we treat 
hepatitis is a big problem for them as is vd we never had that 
before 
based at 14 inland airports the flying doctors are responsible 
for some 5000 outposts scattered across the desolate outback 
often having to land at night on dirt strips or paddocks with just 
car lights showing the way 
the network at its most dramatic saves lives as well as 
providing the general practitioner service that city folk are 
accustomed to 
one prime minister the late sir robert menzies described the 
service as the greatest single contribution to the effective 
settlement of the far distant back country that we have witnessed 
in our time 
flynn established the service with the intent of banishing much 
of the dread associated with the great loneliness of the outback 
and the fear of becoming ill in so isolated a place 
the inland holds many lonely graves of people who might have 
lived had they been able to receive medical help quickly said 
partridge 
the first flight was with the queensland and northern territory 
aerial service later to become the national flag carrier qantas 
airways now the flying doctor service operates separately 
the network has become an intrinsic part of australian folklore 
two television series a country practice and the flying 
doctor are huge successes here as well as in britain where they 
also are shown 
they are true to life because we vet the scripts said 
partridge 
long ago homesteaders had to pedal a wireless to talk to their 
nearest neighbor some still talk via bush radio but now almost 
everyone is hooked up to a telephone service via satellite 
flynn or flynn of the inland as he was known began his 
missionary work at a time when only two doctors served an area of 
some 186000 square miles in droughtprone western australia state 
and 930000 square miles in the northern territory which is 
subtropical 
today the service maintains 34 aircraft and employs 18 doctors 
48 pilots 54 radio operators and 22 engineers it operates on an 
annual budget of 16 million australian dollars almost 13 
million 10 percent of which it raises privately the government 
provides the rest 
similar services based on the australian example operate in 
africa and canada 
the australian flying doctor service is unique and its 
headquarters at broken hill in new south wales is almost a required 
stop for heads of state visiting australia 
being a pilot for the service entails more than treating the 
sick pilots must do their own refuelling handling heavy drums at 
isolated airstrips and sometimes make emergency repairs 
partridge said at times pilots have landed their beechcraft 
turboprops only to smash into a kangaroo 
you dont get that in the city he said

cracks are appearing in finlands 
experimental coalition government of socialists and conservatives 
after 15 months in office 
from foreign trade issues to budget planning the two former 
rivals are finding their new partnership uncomfortable 
the finnish government is run by consensus and state welfare is 
universally embraced as a result issues are lowkeyed and changes 
are incremental though rhetoric can be heated foreign policy 
direction is the responsibility of the president currently mauno 
koivist who is elected separately from parliament members 
the government formed in may 1987 combined the socialistic 
social democratic party with the conservative party a moderate 
marketoriented group the two are ideological opposites and 
clashes seemed inevitable from the outset 
the latest tension was triggered by a secret government decision 
to allow a finnish company to buy enriched copper from the 
multinational la escondida concern of chile which has a military 
government 
although social democratic cabinet ministers had concurred in 
the decision their defense of the government was lukewarm when 
word of the deal leaked out and was criticized in a petition by 70 
prominent social democrats 
the powerful transport workers union said it will refuse to 
handle deliveries from chile the central trade union organization 
also controlled by the social democrats said it would campaign for 
a global boycott until democracy returns to chile 
trade and industry minister ilkka suominen the conservative 
party chairman charged that the social democrats had distanced 
themselves from the government and did not give sufficient 
support to government programs 
in response the social democratic chairman pertti paasio 
assailed the governments secrecy in the matter 
it was the wrong way to handle the la escondida deal 
especially as the decision forbade government ministers to talk to 
other leading politicians about the matter paasio told the 
associated press 
the coalition has given the conservatives a significant role in 
government for the first time since world war ii they had served 
briefly and in minor posts only twice since the war 
the social democrats dominated postwar politics in alliance with 
the center party and its leader urho kekkonen who was president 
for 25 years until he resigned in 1981 because of ill health he 
died aug 31 1986 
kekkonen who maintained friendly ties to moscow locked the 
conservatives out of power in deference to soviet leaders who 
objected to the partys hardline anticommunist position and who 
feared it might lead finland away from its neutral foreign policy 
before the 1987 election thenprime minister kalevi sorsa a 
social democrat said cooperation with the conservatives was 
totally out of the question 
in the vote for the 200member parliament the social democrats 
remained finlands largest party with 56 seats but the 
conservatives made sizeable gains by winning 53 
a conservative harri holkeri was named prime minister and 
sorsa became foreign minister 
no longer outcasts at home the conservatives it seems also 
have become acceptable to moscow they recently received their 
first official invitation to the soviet union and suominen will 
lead a delegation to moscow in the autumn 
the real test for the leftright coalition will be over the 1989 
budget and a tax reform proposal aimed at trimming income tax and 
public spending the social democrats oppose slashing the money 
underwriting state welfare in the budget which must go to 
parliament in early september 
at a party conference in midaugust the conservatives vowed to 
cut the maximum marginal tax rate to 40 percent at most from the 
current 51 percent on the top tax brackets by scandinavian 
standards where the top rate can be 75 percent finnish taxes are 
moderate 
the social democrats while agreeing to some reforms stress 
that any changes should favor the poorer sectors of society 
housing including the financing of sorely needed rental 
apartments is another bone of contention between the two partners 
suominen has suggested selling stateowned company shares an 
idea that he said is not a problem for us conservatives but 
might cause ideological headaches within the other government 
party 
whether these strains will mean an early end for the coalition 
is still unclear but the political mood appears to be one of 
waitandsee

smelly sewage notwithstanding the tiber is having a 
renaissance 
once the river was the lifeline of rome from ancient times to 
just a century ago romans bathed fished and washed their clothes 
in it 
romes unplanned development boom after world war ii however 
proved too much for the river in 20 years the population swelled 
from 1 million to more than 3 million 
anyone foolish enough to swim in the tiber risks fatal infection 
from the untreated sewage that pours into it daily todays romans 
dont have the habit a going down to the river a stroll there 
means sidestepping broken bottles rats and syringes discarded by 
drug addicts 
but this summer gave tiber lovers hope the tide is turning their 
way in the battle against pollution and neglect 
with an eye on developing tourist attractions for 1990 when 
rome hosts the world cup soccer games the city offered free boat 
rides during july the response was so great that the promotion was 
extended into september 
tickets sold out for sunset cruises to the romantic setting of a 
play performed at the roman amphitheater at ostia antica the 
tibers ancient port 
hot breezeless nights found young romans playing cards and 
dancing on tiberina island 
the fish will return there will be pleasure boats this isnt 
the thames but theres reason to believe the tiber can be made 
livable for flora and flauna said aurelio s misiti a sanitary 
engineer and professor at romes la sapienza university his 
department works closely with the city on tiber projects 
while dictator benito mussolini had declared the river 
contaminated and banned swimming and transport in 1924 misiti 
noted postwar governments didnt get around to prohibiting the 
dumping of sewage into it until 1976 
in 1974 rome started building the first purification plant 
misiti said in an interview now there are four plants but they 
can only handle a bit less than half the discharge and thats just 
talking about urban waste not industrys which is supposed to be 
handled by the factories themselves the sewage treatment program 
was supposed to have been completed years ago 
misiti said it should be finished by 1992 and after that the 
tiber should return to normal 
just outside the city fisherman pull in edible catch from the 
river which begins its 251mile course in the etruscan apennines 
paola ruggeri of the world wildlife fund says the city for the 
most part doesnt enforce regulations forcing factories to purify 
their wastes before spilling them into the tiber 
since 1982 her group has rented from the city a stretch of 
riverbank and intends to keep it as a green oasis 
willows poplars even a fig tree lean out to the water making 
that stretch look more like mark twains mississippi than a river 
channeled through a noisy trafficplagued international city 
every week volunteers come to clean it and every week we find 
a mountain of garbage ms ruggeri said 
until about a century ago the city spilled down to the river 
banks leaving rome vulnerable to devastating floods roughly every 
couple of hundred years 
after many suggestions including those of giuseppe garibaldi 
the unification hero the government began walling off the tiber 
and demolishing buildings at riverlevel now pedestrians and cars 
move along at bridgedeck level with the tibers murky green 
waters are out of sight below 
earlier this year when the city planned its annual april 21 
celebrations of the legendary founding of rome by romulus along the 
left bank of the tiber it hosted an exhibit about excavations done 
in the last 10 years when the river became a distinct department 
within the citys superintendency of archaeology 
tourists walking along the river can see the excavation of a 
threelevel storehouse for jars of oil wine and fish sauce left 
dockside by barges at the ancient port near what is now testaccio 
a bluecollar workers neighborhood 
in the past the city lived on its river rome was a kind of 
venice a copenhagen a london or a paris said claudio 
mocchegiani carpano head of the citys underwater archaeology 
department 
a thousand years from now when they dig up artifacts from the 
20th century theyll find out that the tiber just ran through rome 
and served as a sewer carpano said

editors note poliomyelitis the terror of decades ago is a 
disease everyone assumed was over and done with not quite it is 
staging a mysterious encore for those once afflicted its called 
postpolio syndrome and by any name its a particularly cruel twist 
of the knife the writer is one of thousands of expatients at risk 
</TEXT>

there is a terrorist long believed dead that is back on the 
street again 
it is not a person 
it is a disease or a phantom of it the disease is 
poliomyelitis the once dreaded infantile paralysis which killed 
and crippled adults as readily as children despite its name 
polio has returned in ways not thoroughly understood as if to 
have a last laugh on those very victims it maimed 30 40 and even 
50 years ago 
it is called postpolio syndrome or postpolio muscular atrophy 
it is most likely not a recurrence of the disease itself it is not 
fatal it is or can be crippling its victims are only those who 
have already had polio 
a 43yearold nurse in plainfield nj is now bedridden her 
postpolio working days apparently over a schoolteacher in 
bridgewater nj joyce houser had lost 50 percent of the muscles 
in what had been her good hand polio survivors who have walked 
unaided for 30 years are back in braces again pain has returned 
there may be 500000 polio survivors in the united states 
doctors have predicted that up to 25 percent of them will have some 
recurrence of pain muscle loss or both 
it is not a real cheery picture says dr frederick m 
maynard of the university of michigan hospital in ann arbor 
mrs houser has organized one of some 200 groups of polio 
survivors nationwide who meet to discuss the return of the malady 
and educate the medical community which has sometimes misdiagnosed 
the symptoms as arthritis or aging 
there are 15 studies nationwide into the phenomenon one at the 
national institute of health in bethesda md is investigating 
whether the causes stem from some remnant polio virus others 
suspect muscles that have been overloaded to compensate for missing 
ones have begun giving way from overuse there are theories that 
muscle nerve cells that survived have deteriorated from overwork 
and are not being replaced because polio left the system with a 
depleted supply no one is sure 
were trying to inform the public the former patients and the 
public says mrs houser who persuaded gov thomas kean of new 
jersey to declare polio survivor week last june 
polio always insidious and indiscriminate has left its 
survivors with bodies 20 years older than their actual ages mrs 
houser was told at a convention of postpolio groups in st louis 
last year that is why ppma is often mistaken for evidence of aging 
to the survivors it is the return of a specter 
summer in the years before dr jonas salk introduced his polio 
vaccine in 1955 was not just summer it was the polio season 
mothers fretted over any telltale sign of headache or sore throat 
or stiffness in their children despite the heat they kept the 
kids away from public swimming pools seemingly by whim the disease 
would become epidemic in scattered areas of the country 
the summer of 1949 was such a year 
that was the summer a friend from college and i were making a 
lessthangrand tour of europe at one point we took a night train 
from paris to heidelberg in occupied germany although visas were 
hard to come by the train was crowded there was one vacant seat 
on a bench in a thirdclass coach customarily we flipped for who 
got the mattress in the fleabynight hotels and inns where they 
stayed the loser got the springs on the train the loser tried to 
sleep without success amid the feet on the crowded coach when i 
got to heidelberg i was dog tired more bad luck heidelberg was 
having a polio epidemic that summer 
polio takes about 10 days to incubate ten days after heidelberg 
we were on a small ocean liner heading home after a day of deck 
tennis and a night in the ships pub i woke on the morrow with 
not unexpectedly a splitting headache stiff muscles and an 
uncertain stomach unable to handle lunch i went back to our cabin 
to lie down in my upper bunk tails again several hours later i 
awoke and reached for the bunk light with my left arm the shoulder 
didnt move and hasnt since selfdiagnosis was easy polio 
the legs still worked so i set off for the sick bay 
polio once it surfaces moves swiftly there are no wonder 
drugs for it bulbar polio which strikes towards the brain can 
kill in hours nonbulbar victims lie helplessly as random muscles 
about the body cease to function sometimes forever the 
frustration is as great as the fear two days after i was playing 
deck tennis i couldnt turn over in my bunk in the ships surgery 
a few hours after that i could only wiggle my finger and my toes 
my breathing was becoming labored a classic progression

the only oxygen was in possession of the ships welding 
department it was rigged with a hose and a glass funnel to 
improvise an oxygen tent it helped a little i fell into a fitful 
dream i was running down a large cavern with no end in the middle 
ground i saw another running figure who was also myself i later 
learned that a number of people who have skirted death have had 
similar dreams 
the case became something of a natural media event for those 
presalk years youth stricken with polio in midatlantic the 
victims companion a hero of the piece persuaded the ships 
command that some treatment might be used other than a stiff upper 
lip new york was radioed and a polio specialist was flown to 
halifax nova scotia from there the doctor boarded a us coast 
guard cutter to rendezvous with the ship in midocean where a 
hurricane was blowing itself out 
he brought a portable breathing machine with him but didnt use 
it the polio again by whim had gone as far as it was going to 
go he surveyed his patient and said simply youll walk again 
on landing i was taken to a hospital in new york that had turned 
over a whole ward to victims of that summers epidemic my room had 
three other patients one a 33yearold salesman in an iron lung a 
7yearold boy in a lung was across the hall next door was a woman 
doubly afflicted she had polio and she was also unmarried and 
pregnant up the hall was a sadistic teenager who tormented a 
roommate who could only move his hands but not his arms or legs 
by putting comic books just out of his reach a vigilante duo one 
with legs and the other with arms combined to pushdrag an idle 
litter up the hall to stop the barbarity 
it was a case in point polio has no morals the tormentor who 
had been brought in an iron lung walked out paralysisfree seven 
weeks later having done nothing to help his rehabilitation but 
whine others courageously worked on what muscles that remained to 
them for months on end and got nowhere 
polio has one forgiving aspect paralysis is at its maximum in 
the first few days during the acute phase from there on there is 
return of muscle sometimes much sometimes too little this does 
leave room for hope 
the disease is an anatomy professor patients learn the names of 
muscles they may no longer have biceps the arms flexer triceps 
the arm straightener leg adductors pronaters supraspinatus 
knowing what muscle does or did what helps the patient weigh his 
future no biceps trying to hold a plate in buffet line may be an 
invitation to broken crockery weak triceps pushing a heavy 
revolving door wont be easy no adductors say goodbye to skiing 
the patient as the deep and constant pain of muscle spasms 
gradually subsides and twinges of motion return can begin to think 
of a longer future this is not easy to visualize when trying to 
read a newspaper flat on your back with only wriggling fingers it 
leaves you blanketed with pages like all the shrouds fit to print 
but eventually there comes time to make a survey will you ever 
be able to feed yourself open a door walk outside hold a job 
marry and have children will you drown in selfpity or challenge 
the world from a wheelchair polio can be rather instructive in the 
area of selfknowledge 
but it is the little things that are the first hurdles building 
up enough finger strength to twist a radio dial on enough 
biceps to lift a fork there is the rage of hopeless frustration in 
trying to tie a bow tie the newspapers have said that sen robert 
dole who lost the use of an arm from a war wound takes 10 minutes 
to button his shirt they say he has an angry streak in him a 
polio survivor can understand 
gradually as movement returns no more predictable than it went 
away the survivor learns new tricks a bow tie can be tied if the 
bad arm is braced against a door jamb revolving doors can be 
mastered by waiting for someone to enter first and do most of the 
shoving the person in leg braces learns which steps in a friends 
house to avoid learns to swallow pride and accept a piggyback 
if the muscles are weak the determination for the polio 
survivor seems to be as strong in inverse proportion 
the salesman in the iron lung in the hospital in new york 
eventually managed another hospital from a wheelchair after some 
months i did walk again just as predicted my last prepolio 
round of golf had been 101 my first postpolio was 102 i had lost 
one stroke and a number of scattered muscles the other day i tried 
to lift a box of heavy bolts off the top shelf of a ship chandlery 
the weakened triceps and the absent deltoids werent up to it and 
the whole load cascaded over my head onto the floor 
well polios from those prevaccine days of 30 40 and 50 years 
ago have learned if nothing else to be philosophical about the 
world their limitations have left for them 
thats why postpolio muscular atrophy after all those decades 
of learning to cope seem to be a particularly cruel twist of the 
knife i dont know if its happening to me but ive already taken 
a night train to heidelberg i dont want to have to go again

colonial cottages on spacious grounds and 
lovely scenery greeted liz when she arrived in west virginia a 
matronly woman held out her arms and said come on in sweetie 
come on in that was to serve your 30year sentence in the 
place to be if youre in that kind of a jam for this was lizs 
welcome to the federal correctional institute at alderson the 
federal governments only allwomens prison 
here where the greenbrier river winds among rolling hills the 
affluent come to take mineral waters and farmers bring livestock 
to market liz curls up on the bed in her tiny private room 
theres a fluffy pink rug bits of beads and ribbons are draped 
around the mirror snapshots are pinned to the wall reminders of 
the daughters liz left behind in faroff texas 
neither liz nor the prison will specify her offense in this 
place says liz you can forget 
not entirely 
this is a prison says jean gump a pacifist who took a 
sledgehammer to a missile silo and must spend eight years away from 
her 12 children 
the head counts homosexuality contraband snitching 
inspections guards isolation lack of privacy lack of control 
all are typical of prison life 
added to that are the absent children 
a social worker says about 80 percent of the women at alderson 
are mothers 
what happens to the children the families of the women here 
is devastating gump says 
things go wrong at home the children get into trouble they go 
to jail their mothers sit helpless in prison cut off by the same 
mountains that make the view so pretty 
it is so heartbreaking another inmate says everyone in 
the visiting room starts crying it must be the most intense 
torture there is the intense pain of being emotionally helpless 
lizs daughters are growing into strangers she copes she says 
by not thinking about it 
you cant be a mother you try to be a friend says dora 
brown serving life for murder 
browns husband ran off with a younger woman and left her three 
sons to fend for themselves they lasted a month before they got 
into trouble and two were made wards of the state she has seen 
them twice in the past year 
sometimes there is sisterhood 
youll see it in people that you think my god theyre so 
violent theyre so cold theyre so everything all of a sudden 
this one woman is going to have a need and then the goofy one you 
think is so nuts responds gump says 
it is so good it is just so good you cant count on it but 
it manifests itself 
but mostly the women shut their turmoil inside if they didnt 
brown says it would be a mess around here 
easygoing as life is in alderson compared with other prisons 
temptation to escape remains charles manson disciple lynette 
squeaky fromme escaped last christmas when she thought her 
cult guru also in prison had cancer and i just had to get 
out she was captured after three days fromme was sentenced in 
an assassination attempt on thenpresident gerald ford 
another inmate fled in the winter of 1984 to reach the bedside 
of her ailing father her frozen body was found in an abandoned 
feed store about a mile from the prison six weeks later 
aldersons warden is ronald burkhart at some federal prisons 
he says you can cut the tension with a knife 
here the tone is more relaxed he says i dont want it 
to be tense 
hes speaking in his office on a humid 90degree day hotter 
inside the warden has his tie knotted his suit coat on and the 
air conditioner off he looks comfortable 
burkhart plays it cool eighteen prisoners escaped the year he 
arrived 1984 five fled last year and only one so far this year 
our first wall is our staff he says friendly but not 
familiar more relaxed inmates means fewer escapes 
when nuclear disarmament radical helen woodson tried to 
escape in march she hung an end war banner on the prison 
fence walked through the outer gate and poured white paint on the 
parking lot 
guards marched her back in the warden stayed calm 
she said i escaped didnt i and i said no you 
didnt burkhart says

security at alderson is not oppressive on the grounds maximum 
security murderers some holding hands are chatting with 
minimumsecurity embezzlers beneath majestic oaks 
the only gun visible is one carried by a guard who patrols the 
159acre penitentiarys perimeter walking along a chainlink fence 
that doesnt always keep neighborhood dogs out 
beyond however are the mountains and miles and miles of woods 
which make a stroll to freedom much less inviting 
the isolation that keeps prisoners in also keeps their families 
out 
the remoteness is a real barrier says john vodicka who 
with his wife runs a hospitality house for what few inmate 
relatives make the journey to this rural corner of west virginia 
where greenbrier summers and monroe counties meet 
amtrak pulls through alderson about a mile down the road from 
the prison three times a week a van brings families from 
washington dc twice a month the only other way is by car 
last thanksgiving vodicka says only some 65 of the 812 inmates 
received visitors 
the geographic isolation grates aldersons inmate population is 
45 percent black and 24 percent hispanic more than 150 inmates are 
colombians and many of the women dont speak english most are 
from big cities 
their relatives often find the alderson environment rural and 
95 percent white puzzling 
its a tolerant town however one of those rare communities 
that actually wanted the prison to be built there and donated land 
for it ive been really impressed with how friendly alderson 
is say vodickas wife dee 
inmates in fact march in aldersons holiday parade they 
provide fire protection too the prison runs the nations only 
allfemale firefighting force competition is keen among inmates 
for the tough training required in part because they then live in 
a cottage set aside for the firefighters and emergency medical 
technicians 
the women take special delight in telling about the time they 
arrived at the scene of a car accident and treated the injured 
child of a prison guard 
in this rather unusual coexistence town folk dont worry when 
the prison whistle sounds an occasional escape alert 
you just about expect it says a waitress at the alderson 
livestock markets coffee bar mostly i never think about it if 
it were men youd think of more hardened criminals if a man 
escapes you have to watch for it but women 
among the betterknown prisoners at alderson have been tokyo 
rose and axis sally serving time for their world war ii activities 
in behalf of the nations enemies singer billie holiday was there 
once on a drug conviction 
no prison is wholly trouble free in 1979 inmates complained of 
mistreatment by guards and inadequate health care one woman told a 
civil rights task force that prison doctors didnt discover her 
pregnancy until she gave birth to twins one alive and one 
stillborn 
in 1982 haitian refugees held there while the federal 
government tried to figure out what to do with them waged a 
hunger strike and two were forcefed 
lesbianism is said to be widespread but as one former warden 
noted homosexuality in a womens institution doesnt take the 
same violent form it often does in a male facility 
alderson was unusual from its beginnings in 1927 inmates in 
white gloves served tea and presented plays under the first warden 
superintendent mary b harris who once taught latin at a girls 
finishing school in chicago in typical style she posed for her 
wardens portrait in pearls fur stole and white elbowhigh gloves 
when the modern alderson staged a show in 1981 it appeared on 
tvs the games people play with inmates and staff competing 
over an obstacle course and criminal lawyer f lee bailey serving 
as the commentator 
despite aldersons relative sedateness there are violent 
prisoners there and for such hardcore inmates the end of life 
there is approaching the bureau of prisons is creating a second 
allwomen penitentiary in lexington ky where violentprone 
offenders will be housed in an underground complex alderson will 
be converted to a camp 
inmates at alderson hate the idea of being transferred to 
another prison which is a considerable incentive for good behavior 
says liz the 30year termer if they write a howto book on 
prison the first thing it should say is if you have to go to 
jail ask for alderson

stew leonard wont mind a bit disneys my hero he says 
the different dairy is another catchphrase and proof of 
that can be found on the bottom line stew leonards dairy store 
sells 100 million worth of food a year more per square foot than 
any other grocery this despite an inventory of 700 items a 
typical supermarket carries 24000 and the presence of 93 other

the philosophy that got him here is literally chiseled in stone 
outside the dairy a rambling gray building that resembles a barn 
a threeton hunk of granite at the entrance reads 
rule 1 the customer is always right 
rule 2 if the customer is ever wrong reread rule 1 
skeptics need only hang around the customer service counter 
where cheerful employees soothe the disgruntled recently they 
included a woman complaining of stale coffee beans when had she 
bought them two years ago she got a refund as did the 
shopper who returned her christmas tree in march 
it had dried out 
not long ago a woman asked for and got a refund for 20 
pounds of shrimp later a worker discovered shed never paid for 
them 
my hardest job is not to catch her but to keep those people 
on the customer service desk from developing a bad attitude says 
leonard who thinks 999 people out of a thousand are honest 
i know ive got to get cheated once in awhile but dont tell 
me about it dont shade my thinking 
i grew up in norwalk so i feel like its part of me says 
employee richard lung who works on stews news a sort of 
people magazine for employees that a business magazine calls 
the ultimate company newsletter 
i had no art degree but four years ago he gave me a chance 
im glad its a special place to work among other fringe 
benefits lung says his employer has paid for art classes and 
seminars at bridgeport university 
some kids dream of becoming movie stars stew leonard dreamed of 
being a milkman the youngest of seven hed get up at 4 am for 
the thrill of riding along on his fathers norwalk milk route 
his father died four months after stew graduated from college 
he took over the business got married had four children then in 
1968 the state built a highway through his dairy 
leonard gambled he could get customers to make a special trip 
for milk by building a store around a dairy 
he was 38 years old he remortgaged his house dipped into his 
kids college fund and borrowed 482500 from the small business 
administration a record amount at the time 
from the beginning the store was different instead of many 
narrow aisles leonard built one wide labyrinth that brings 
customers facetoface with the entire inventory in 1969 the year 
he opened it consisted of seven items 
since then hes added on 27 times the store now features a 1 
million kitchen that turns out 200 salads and hot entrees daily a 
barbecue department and a seasonal garden shop that pops up with 
the crocuses 
the milkprocessing plant which pasteurizes and packages 5 
million halfgallons of milk and 1 halfgallons of orange juice 
annually is glassedin so customers can watch cartons whiz by at 
150 per minute 
stews children have all joined the business 
a firm believer in nepotism leonard has 22 relatives in the 
store half his 600 employees have relatives here too its very 
good for the culture of a company he says 
in spare moments leonard works on his design for the new and 
improved stew leonards set to open in danbury in two years he 
says itll be similar to norwalk only bigger 
and this time the cows will be real

editors note bruce gurner has been a schoolteacher 
commercial fisherman photographer but what really got into his 
blood was railroading and on one small but famous slice of it 
the last ride of casey jones hes become the expert of experts 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
water valley miss the 20th century was not quite four months 
old when railroad engineer john luther casey jones crashed the 
cannon ball express into a freight train at vaughan miss and 
became an american folk hero 
bruce gurner had not been born then but youd never guess it 
listening to him talk sitting under a shade tree in his front yard 
on the edge of town thumbs tucked under the bib of his overalls a 
railroaders cap on his head 
casey jones was a good engineer he was saying casey 
would have made a good jet pilot he was a bit of a chancetaker 
but he got caught in a trap that was not of his own making 
if casey hadnt of gotten killed he would have died of a 
broken heart because he sure would have gotten fired for what 
happened railroading was his first love even his wife janie she 
was the cutest thing came in second to railroading 
bruce gurner 68 former schoolteacher and railroad engineer 
historian and photographer fisherman curator of his own backyard 
museum of railroad memorabilia chronicler of the last ride of 
casey jones retired 10 years ago after losing the sight in his 
left eye gurner spends much of his time these days in his canoe 
out on enid reservoir running trotlines in quest of crappie and 
catfish 
i tried to be a commercial fisherman for a while after i 
retired but i found out that when you do it regular its not as 
much fun he says no telling where i would have gone if i 
hadnt been kind of lazy 
for 40 years or so he had alternated between two careers 
railroading and teaching in high school he was also shooting 
pictures for the local weekly newspaper and working with the 
yalobusha county historical society while raising five sons and a 
daughter 
among his fondest memories are working on the city of new 
orleans like his father and his uncles thats the passenger train 
that splits the heartland on its 920mile run from chicago to new 
orleans and was made famous by arlo guthries hit folk song in 1972 
when i quit teaching at oxford i put in two years on that 
beautiful city of new orleans firing working as a fireman for cap 
gardner boy was that high living making twice as much money as i 
was teaching eight days a month off 
if you want to listen bruce gurner can talk to you for hours 
about highballing up and down the illinois central tracks from 
memphis tenn to canton miss and the golden era of steam 
locomotives in the days when water valley was a railroad town 
with a big roundhouse and shop and people like casey jones lived 
there 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
come all you rounders if you want to hear 
the story told of a brave engineer 
casey jones was the rounders name 
a high rightwheeler of mighty fame 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it took me 25 years to figure out what happened to him down 
there at vaughan says gurner who collected rare photographs and 
old railroad records and the recollections of casey jones widow 
and the oldtimers who had ridden with him thing is nothing 
would have ever come of it except that an engine wiper in the 
canton shop who was an old friend of caseys wrote that ballad 
about it and some vaudeville performers picked it up 
engineers were getting killed all the time in those days of 
heavy traffic on singletrack railroads when slow freights had to 
be sidetracked to make way for the passenger trains sometimes they 
didnt even get their names in the paper when they got killed but 
casey had a song written about him and america had a new folk 
hero 
at 1250 am on the morning of april 30 1900 casey jones 
pulled out of memphis poplar street station at the throttle of the 
cannon ball express with sim webb as his fireman and jc turner 
the conductor casey was leaving an hour and 35 minutes late and 
wanted to make up the time before he reached canton 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
through south memphis yards on the fly 
he heard the fireman say you got a white eye 
all the switchmen knew by the engines moan 
that the man at the throttle was casey jones

in an selfpublished account of jones last ride gurner who 
has made that same run many times described how jones had probably 
made up that lost time 
passenger comfort was not too important in those days and 
damage suits for being thrown about at high rates of speed almost 
unheard of gurner says 
the cannon ball was on time when it reached goodman 10 miles 
north of vaughan but disaster awaited down the tracks to make way 
for the passenger train two long freights one headed north and 
one headed south were switched off to a siding on the east side of 
the main line but the caboose and three cars of the southbound 
train were still protruding onto the main line 
sim webb the fireman first saw the caboose shouted and jumped 
to safety casey jones hit the emergency brakes but stayed with his 
engine as it crashed into the rear cars of the freight and lunged 
to the left coming to rest pointing in the direction it came a 
bolt or a splinter of lumber pierced jones in the throat he was 
taken on a stretcher to the depot a halfmile away where he died 
lying on a baggage wagon 
in addition to webb three passengers an american express 
messenger and two postal clerks were slightly injured 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
all the crew safe you say and the passengers too 
thank god that is clever 
and his soft eyes closed as his pale face smiled 
and he whistled down brakes forever 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what went wrong webb said later he saw a flagman and heard the 
torpedoes explosive devices placed on the tracks to warn the 
engineer but gurner contends jones was shortflagged 
the flagman didnt get far enough back for jones so see him in 
time to stop he says 
nonetheless the railroads investigation concluded that 
engineer jones was solely responsible for the accident as a 
consequence of not having responded to flag signals 
according to railroad records the illinois central railroad 
awarded webb 5 for his injuries the messenger who hurt his back 
got 23 and the two postal clerks 1 each 
why didnt casey jump 
that is really the hard one to answer gurner says once 
the engineer puts the brake in emergency reverses the engine and 
opens the sanders the engine has no further need of his services 
even though gurner insists jones was a fine engineer he 
found railroad records that showed jones had been suspended nine 
times for periods ranging from 5 days to 30 days for safety 
violations between feb 14 1891 and may 22 1899 the offenses 
included such things as collision in water valley yard 
running through switch at carbondale for not recognizing 
flagman who was protecting work train 
jones lived in water valley from 1893 to 1896 he moved his wife 
and three sons back to jackson tenn at his wifes insistence 
but he retained his membership in the water valley lodge of the 
brotherhood of locomotive engineers today there are casey jones 
museums at jackson and at vaughan where much of gurners 
memorabilia is on display 
gurner being from a family of railroaders got interested in 
railroad history and began taking pictures as a boy in 1940 he 
signed on as a machinists apprentice at the illinois central shop 
in paducah ky where the water valley shop had been transplanted 
he got to know men like bob moore a retired engineer and bob 
ward a retired shop man who had known casey jones well 
when they tore the old water valley depot down i got this 
wealth of old records that were being hauled off to the garbage 
dump gurner says 
but the railroad in water valley today is only a memory 
they ran the last train in february of 82 gurner says 
they even took up the tracks that was adding insult to injury

editors note its the largest walrus hauling ground in the 
united states an island off southwest alaska that each summer 
attracts thousands of the 2ton mammals with their long tusks but 
the numbers of walruses on round island have been dwindling in 
recent years from a peak of 15000 in the mid1970s to about 4500 
this summer state biologists blame the noise 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
noisy sightseers and fishermen 
intruding on the walruses of round island may be causing the 
blubbery beasts to defect to the soviet union where they enjoy more 
privacy 
each summer thousands of bull walruses haul out on the huge 
rocks that ring the shore of this mistenshrouded island 13 miles 
off southwest alaska 
the puffing snorting hissing mammals ponderously heave their 2 
tons of bulk from the frigid waters of the bering sea and shoulder 
and poke their way with their huge ivory tusks into the overlapping 
mass of their thickskinned brethren 
each is seeking a place in the sun a spot to rest between 
seven to 10day feeding frenzies 
from a distance they look like layers of cinnamoncolored 
fringe stitched to the base of the cliffs up close they look more 
like bewhiskered bachelors sleeping off the effects of a boozy 
beach party eyes closed heads down their bodies oozing into 
crevices in the rocks 
while the males are piled up on beaches as far south as kodiak 
island and yakutat bay the females and their young remain with the 
pack ice north of the bering strait and into the arctic ocean 
but the number of pacific walruses that haul out here and in 
lesser numbers at the other six islands of the walrus islands state 
game sanctuary have started to decline again after a spectacular 
comeback that peaked in the 1970s 
on round island they have enjoyed considerable privacy in the 
past largely because of the weather and location the nearest 
community is togiak some 33 miles by charter boat to the northeast 
summertime weather is characterized by wind rain and high waves 
that make approach by floatplane or small boat hazardous if not 
impossible 
but with increased commercial bottomfishing activity and the 
prospect of oil exploration and development in salmonrich bristol 
bay all that isolation may come to an end and that has some 
professional walrus watchers concerned 
walruses are pretty sensitive to disturbance says lloyd 
lowry a marine mammal specialist with the alaska department of 
fish and game in fairbanks 
theres more than a little concern that the noise caused by 
the fishery has adversely influenced the haulout people on the 
island say they sometimes can hear the radios on the bridges of the 
boats 
ken taylor another state biologist monitors walrus numbers 
from his office in dillingham 
in the mid1970s we had as many as 15000 animals there 
taylor says it was 4400 last year and about 4500 now the 
difficult thing is there are so many reasons for the numbers to go 
up and down 
to my mind the sheer number of boats out there with motors 
droning in the water sets up an acoustical noise that may be a 
cause 
the two game technicians on round island this summer polly 
hessing and judy brandt say they counted as many as 180 boats in 
the area during a peak fishing period this spring 
although the vessels were outside the twomile limit established 
around the sanctuary the noise they made was loud enough to force 
the women to close the windows in their cabin so they could get 
some sleep 
the state set up the sanctuary in 1960 to protect the last 
remaining walrus hauling grounds in the south bering sea 
thirty permits a day half for overnight and half for day use 
are available for people wishing to visit the island 
access however is restricted to a narrow corridor fronting a 
grassy campground new arrivals are asked to anchor offshore until 
the technicians can pick them up in their small inflatable raft 
although walruses get top billing the treeless island also 
supports nearly 450000 sea birds primarily common murres 
blacklegged kittiwakes cormorants parakeet auklets horned and 
tufted puffins and gulls 
red fox on the island are unafraid of people and often share 
trails with campers 
hundreds of sea lions provide a change in the soundtrack on the 
islands southern beaches and a showy mix of wildflowers anchors 
the thin soil on its taluscovered slopes 
no one seems to know much about the dynamics of the pacific 
walrus herd its believed to comprise some 234000 animals back 
to its 18th century levels before commercial harvesting severely 
depleted its numbers 
we have a lot of broadscale information but little in the 
way of specifics about haulouts and food lowry says we know 
the population is large we dont know its bounds walrus came back 
from virtually no animals in the 40s to peak counts in the late 
70s 
the population on round island dipped as low as 3000 in 1983 
changes in the climate variations in the food chain the 
growing volume of noise and other human disturbances are being 
blamed for what appears to be a downward trend 
two years does not a trend make but we are becoming 
concerned lowry says walrus are fairly traditional about 
where they haul out so are sea lions but there are several other 
places they could go and we dont know if the herd is simply 
splitting up or what its doing 
the twomile buffer and surveillance by fish and game personnel 
stationed there from may to september of each year is credited with 
limiting some of the human disturbance such as illegal hunting 
spotter planes from the herring fishery buzzing the island and 
boats coming too close 
taylor says the soviet union is more protective of its walrus 
herd 
on the soviet coast aircraft are held to 10000foot minimums 
and boats restricted to 16 miles he says it may be because of 
those more severe restrictions that more pacific walruses are 
hauling out there 
officials are considering tightening regulations governing at 
least the fishery near round island 
this is a unique place the largest hauling ground in the 
united states lowry says it would be a shame to lose it

editors note the baroque st pauls cathedral designed by 
sir christopher wren is a beloved national monument in britain it 
is also at the center of a heated debate over modern architecture 
since developers have a plan to rebuild much of the neighborhood 
near the cathedral leading the opposition is prince charles who 
has emerged as a highly outspoken critic of todays buildings 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prince charles britains bestknown critic of 
modern building has put architects on the line in the one place 
they cannot afford to blunder opposite st pauls cathedral 
the domed cathedral in london burial place of the nations 
heroes survivor of the nazi blitz is now the focal point of a 
heated debate about how cities should preserve their heritage while 
coping with modern needs 
the debate is symptomatic of a dilemma confronting all historic 
cities in the words of architecture professor charles jencks in 
most cities of the west there is a genteel blood bath going on 
among those who have different tastes 
nowhere is that battle more intense than at paternoster square 
facing the north side of st pauls 
developer tony clegg who owns most of the 7acre site plans to 
tear down a clump of undistinguished 1960s office blocks and put up 
more offices and shops 
but prince charles who got married in st pauls hates cleggs 
plan although he has no architectural background he has made the 
subject one of his favorite hobbyhorses and his opinions carry 
weight 
the baroque cathedral designed by sir christopher wren is a 
beloved national monument so the developers consulted with the 
church of england the royal fine art commission and other 
interested bodies and invited seven architects to compete for the 
development 
they also invited the heir to the throne to see the plans 
charles disliked them all telling a banquet in londons city 
financial district last december i was deeply depressed that 
none of them had risen to the occasion 
surely here if anywhere was the time and place to sacrifice 
some profit if need be for generosity of vision elegance and 
dignity for buildings which would raise our spirits and our faith 
in commercial enterprise and prove that capitalism can have a human 
face the prince said 
he likened much of the rebuilding of british cities since world 
war ii to a rape and in his most controversial utterance 
suggested that modern london architecture was more unsightly than 
the rubble left by the german bombers 
clegg conceded in an interview that theres been a lot of 
criticism of the arup associates plan which his mountleigh group 
chose 
but he added that tastes change noting that the existing plaza 
and buildings now despised were much admired when they went up in 
the 1960s 
it is the princes view that architecture should put people 
first hurrah for the champion of ordinary peopleprince 
charles is acting as the conscience of the nation wrote 
architecture critic gavin stamp in the daily telegraph 
the concrete shopping centers dull office blocks and highrise 
public housing that typify many british cities were built hastily 
to replace war rubble and solve the postwar housing shortage 
now many are so hated that they are being dynamited by city 
authorities today many innercity housing complexes consist of 
cottages and gardens that mesh well with charles 
smallisbeautiful philosophy 
in pittsburgh last march charles told a conference of 
international architects that after 40 years of townplanning in 
the united states and britain the results have been pretty 
disastrous 
charles went public on architecture in 1984 and has developed 
his theme with mounting fervor claiming to speak for ordinary 
people whose views are ignored by the professionals 
although selfappointed as an arbiter of taste 39yearold 
charles is one of the most popular members of the royal fmily and 
his views get results 
a projected extension to the national gallery art museum in 
trafalgar square was shelved after he called it a monstrous 
carbuncle on the face of a wellloved friend 
then he dismissed a 20story tower design of the late mies van 
der rohe for a site near the bank of england as a giant glass 
stump it too was scrapped this year his written complaint about 
apartment blocks planned near his kensington palace residence led 
to their alteration 
charles likes classical style buildings recalling 18th century 
georgian architecture itself inspired by ancient rome he prefers 
buildings on a human scale with groundlevel shops and somewhere to 
sit down 
many architects are aggrieved at being attacked by a man who has 
no formal architectural training a paternoster plan which the 
prince favors john simpsons arcaded shops and lowlevel main 
buildings with columned facades and sculpture has met a lukewarm 
response 
architect maxwell hutchinson tapped as the next president of 
the royal institute of british architects accuses the prince of 
abusing his privileged position 
writing in the independent newspaper hutchinson denounced the 
fogeyish obsession with classical styles and wondered why the 
work of contemporary british architects such as richard rogers who 
codesigned the futuristic pipesandglass pompidou center in 
paris is more admired abroad than at home 
but jencks writing in the observer weekly remarked that most 
people now preferred to live in traditional houses at a village 
level and possibly in some other century 
jencks also told a london audience that charles had played a 
crucial role in widening the debate we are closer now than we 
have been for 70 years to welcoming different schools and 
philosophies of architecture he said 
wren also had problems his first two designs for a replacement 
of the medieval cathedral destroyed in the great fire of 1666 
were rejected 
his cathedral which attracts 3 million visitors a year has 
become a tough act for any architect to follow 
asked if he was worried by all the publicity clegg 51 said 
i think anything worthwhile is going to involve a whole lot of 
argument and it will be worth it even without prince charles lots 
of people would have taken a strong interest in this site 
clegg estimates his development will cost 700 million to 850 
million he says he will apply for planning permission in december 
start building in 1990 and hopes to complete the job by 1993 
the rival plans were displayed for four weeks in the crypt of 
st pauls and attracted 7000 visitors 700 of whom left written 
comments which the developers say will be considered in the final 
plan

the people who will take discover the world 
of science into its fourth pbs season tend to think of the series 
as a kind of curiosity shop 
little ideas that the imagination can pick up and handle the 
show for the most part leaves the panoramic views to nova and 
other ambitious programs that try to bring science to the public 
a lot of people make the mistake of imagining that science is 
too tough for them to get says john angier one of the two 
executive producers of the science program hosted by peter graves 
anybody can get science its about the world and how the 
world works to watch discover there is no need to know any 
science we always make sure whatever background you need is right 
in the story 
we emphasize human interest we do a medical story through the 
eyes and experience of an individual we follow the progress of a 
patient over a long period of time 
graham chedd angiers partner says people tend to think of 
scientists as dull boring or whacked out there are crazies out 
there there also are articulate interesting people doing weird 
and wonderful things all they want to do is find out about 
something or other were one of the few places they can 
consistently tell their stories on tv 
chedd continues i dont want to knock nova but they only 
get to do 10 or 12 new productions a year they have to pick big 
subjects we turn out 20 to 25 new stories we can pick little ones 
if we like 
discover has five shows in a season monthly starting in 
october 
angier studied physics and likes animal and aviation stories 
chedd who studied biology prefers space and medical stories they 
make an eclectic team poring over academic scientific and medical 
research journals fishing in deep waters for scientific game of 
all sizes 
a subpart of a story published in a journal may become our 
story chedd says 
when they heard about some guy in western massachusetts who was 
doing lightning research they sent their people there then west 
to a mountain in new mexico which has the most lightning in the 
country 
while in new mexico one of them happened to run into people 
doing a dinosaur dig looking for a 140foot seismosaurus another 
story lead for discover 
chedd and angier both born in england met through nova 
which angier calls the granddaddy of science broadcasting in this 
country 
i was one of the first producers on that i came from the bbc 
graham was our first science editor he was doing something for the 
american association for the advancement of science in washington 
and started advising us on science content 
they formed cheddangier production company in 1980 in boston 
we went along to the publisher of discover magazine and 
suggested to him a tv companion and that we make it to our 
amazement he listened to us angier says 
the tv show mentions the magazine and the magazine mentions the 
show but stories in the two are different 
discover started life in 198182 as a commercial tv program 
to be syndicated it was a fabulously expensive way of 
distributing angier says thats why our series eventually 
moved to public television 
chedd says the audience for discover has consistently grown 
independent production companies in the documentary field are 
usually a freelance producer with an assistant angier says 
were relatively unusual in that we have 35 people working 
including 10 to 15 producers in hollywood there are giants but 
theyre usually entertainment as far as i know theres no other 
company like ours 
cheddangier also does stories for nova and science 
productions for corporations they currently have in production 26 
halfhour educational shows about statistics at the firstyear 
college level 
gte which is underwriting discover for the fourth season 
sends several million free teachers guides and activity sheets to 
schools which use the show in science teaching 
cheddangier also is working on a 10part series on the global 
environment and planning an eightpart series about molecular 
biology and genetic engineering both with wgbh in boston for 1991 
both men still do some onsite producing for discover 
i was doing a story about the recovery of mount st helens 
angier says it turns out one of the chief ways in which nature 
is rebuilding itself there is by means of gophers they dig through 
the hard core of ash and bring soil to the surface and plants can 
grow in it 
i said to a scientist working there what we need is to get a 
shot of gophers digging how on earth are we going to do this 
he said theyll dig because they dig all the time 
angier pessimistically bet him a case of beer that the gophers 
wouldnt cooperate with the cameras he discovered that one reason 
gophers are such good diggers is that they are always practicing 
they got nothing for their discover appearance but the 
scientist got his beer 
he was right we got all the shots we wanted

john wallowitch is a sophisticated sprite of 
manhattan an impish composer pianist and cabaret performer who 
celebrates new york and chronicles its often bizarre customs and 
mores 
he sings the music of gershwin porter kern rodgers and berlin 
too but he also performs his own compositions usually songs about 
manhattan filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s 70s and 
80s he can lament the loneliness of bigcity life in i live 
alone again laugh at growing old in im 27 or luxuriate in 
the pleasures of high living in back on the town 
the classically trained musician sings anywhere and with little 
coaxing in his cluttered scorestrewn apartment once the home of 
actress katharine cornell on his weekly cable television show in 
tiny nightspots around town or even on the street where his 
yearly serenadings of irving berlin a beekman place neighbor 
have attracted more and more media attention 
the impeccable wallowitch who seems always to be dressed in 
white shirt and bow tie has worked since 1984 with bertram ross 
once a leading dancer in martha grahams company 
we have tons of material says wallowitch a fanatic 
collector of old sheet music three separate evenings of theater 
songs including one about new york i could go through a year and 
not repeat one song which i have done 
with wallowitch providing piano accompaniment ross can launch 
into obscure berlin comic ditties like cohen owes me 97 dollars 
or sadie salome go home wallowitch can handle a tender lush 
love song come a little closer that he wrote himself or the 
duo can rip through virtually unknown songs from forgotten broadway 
shows like rodgers and harts cheechee 
wallowitchs early world wasnt anywhere near the bright lights 
of broadway he grew up in an isolated area of south philadelphia 
a neighborhood across from the city dump and surrounded by gas 
tanks of the atlantic refining co his father owned a butcher shop 
young john the first of four children was precocious he 
admits after all how many youngsters sing genevieve sweet 
genevieve at the age of 3 months in a few years wallowitch was 
picking out tunes on his grandmothers piano and having poems 
published in a childrens column of the local newspaper 
i guess it was desperation he recalls when you are born 
in a neighborhood like that youd better do something 
wallowitch did he took piano lessons 
every wednesday the wallowitch family would listen to the 
lithuanian furniture company radio hour their eldest son wearing 
knickers and anklets made his piano debut on the program playing 
a berlin song called so help me 
wallowitch eventually became a regular on the show usually 
performing short classical pieces his musical education continued 
at edwin vare junior high school where he would sneak into the 
building before classes to play a grand piano he was caught one 
day by the schools music teacher instead of punishment he got 
free lessons 
he went to temple to major in education so he could become a 
high school music teacher but was drafted 
i didnt know what i wanted to do with my life wallowitch 
says but when i got into the army something happened to me 
each night he went to the uso to play the piano 
i became violent about it wallowitch says i would push 
people away from the piano and say i play better than you i was 
terrible but this was my life 
while in the army wallowitch gave his first public performance 
in front of an audience 10000 people in a stadium in 
jacksonville fla he was to play clair de lune but forgot 
part of the piece 
i found myself talking over the microphone and pretending to 
be doing a comedy routine he says 
wallowitch the cabaret performer was born to great applause 
even if he was mortified about forgetting the notes 
wallowitch later returned to temple and to his old high school 
piano teacher he eventually was drawn to new york to study music 
at juilliard he was there for eight years even getting a 
postgraduate degree 
to keep myself solvent i played in tapdancing schools and 
for small dance companies he says he also entered the theater 
working as a rehearsal pianist for new faces of 52 considered 
the best of the broadway revues of the 1950s 
i was so dumb i thought i was going to be this great concert 
pianist wallowitch says when you start to mix with show 
people and you start to realize you have a talent in that area 
then you realize what it takes to be a concert artist and how few 
people really succeed at it theres the loneliness of that life 
and the eight hours a day practicing 
he finally made his concert debut in october 1962 at carnegie 
recital hall getting rave reviews 
he toured europe under state department sponsorship with 
actress and singer ethel barrymore colt he accompanied her 
american theater songs as well as doing his own program 
back in new york he landed a job at a small greenwich village 
nightclub he played piano every night for six hours he even 
attempted to sing one night an irate customer yelled dont 
sing we want to talk the next night wallowitch came back with 
an original composition who needs enemies when i have a friend 
like you and his songwriting career began in earnest 
today wallowitch concentrates on performing writing only 
occasionally 
i can go on a writing jag because i have a lot of ideas he 
says i store them i feel like ibsen you know he would think 
about a thing for two years and then suddenly the whole thing falls 
out

eight professors and eight students 
have been shot to death in the past year allegedly by rightwing 
death squads in a campaign of terror aimed at halting leftwing 
activism at medellins university of antioquia 
it has succeeded 
there has been a steady exodus of students since the killings 
began 39 professors have resigned textbooks that might be thought 
to contain radical ideas have been removed 
a great silence has fallen on a university that once prided 
itself on an outspoken faculty and student body 
having an opinion is a crime said dr clemencia hoyos a 
law professor no one wants to talk now about social problems for 
fear of being killed 
violence had been frequent on the antioquia campus until two 
years ago when demonstrating students set fire to a car on campus 
two nuns happened to be in the randomly selected vehicle and they 
burned to death 
the incident drew national attention and campus violence which 
often included bombings by students came to a halt 
the incident also attracted the attention of death squads 
according to professors interviewed 
death squads have been linked to the killing of more than 800 
people in colombia in the last two years so far not a single 
arrest has been made in any of the deaths 
vigilantes are common in colombias small towns and rural areas 
where hooded men mete out justice frequently to cattle thieves and 
bandits 
except for a few isolated cases vigilantes left universities 
alone then starting last year the vigilantestyle killings came 
to antioquia the latest aug 6 
all of the eight students slain were known radicals who made no 
secret of helping make bombs or setting them off according to a 
half dozen university professors interviewed by the associated 
press 
the eight professors killed had been active in demonstrations to 
get a university rector replaced or were outspoken in their 
classrooms when it came to criticizing government agencies the 
interviewees said 
gunmen drove through the garage door at the home of one of the 
professors and shot him to death in front of his wife and children 
other victims were snatched off streets 
their bodies with hands tied behind their backs and showing 
signs of torture were found along highways outside of town each 
victim had been shot in the back of the head some had their 
fingernails pulled out 
in the plaza of the 167yearold university students in the 
past customarily spoke out on a range of issues in colombia 
alleged government corruption illegal arrests and poverty 
antioquia students have a historical reputation as being the 
most radical of any university in colombia 
attacks by students and professors on the countrys political 
system had earned the university a reputation in colombia as a 
hothouse of marxists leftist guerrillas and terrorists 
one professor asking to remain anonymous for reasons of 
personal safety estimated that about 80 percent of the 
16000member student body is leftist 
politics on campus range from anarchists and revolutionaries to 
those who would like to see a socialist government in colombia but 
who are not violent 
before the killings student orators were free to talk on any 
subject a speech urging students to join colombias estimated 
10000 leftist guerrillas might have been followed by one demanding 
more academic freedom 
now however students talk in hushed tones and fall silent when 
a stranger draws near 
since the killings began 1350 students have left the 
university said the rector dr luis javier arroyave 
thirtyeight professors have resigned in fear of their lives 
according to dr beatriz ortiz president of the 860member 
university of antioquia professors association 
dr maria teresa uribe a professor at the school of social 
sciences said some professors have replaced classroom texts that 
might be considered sources of radical thought 
students stare numbly when asked to comment on a social issue 
she said 
mrs uribe noted that death threats had prompted her to stop 
writing a weekly column in medellins leading newspaper el 
colombiano 
mrs ortiz said she doesnt know how much longer she can endure 
the stress 
since december she said she has lost 20 pounds has 
nightmares rarely sleeps well and has developed a heart disorder 
severe headaches and almost constant aching in her shoulders she 
attributes to tension 
i feel so watched and followed that i take a lot of detours 
sometimes i am so worried about someone following me that ill 
forget where i am going she said 
she and her husband had one german shepherd dog but now have 
three they have installed bright yard lights 
we never never go out after 6 oclock anymore she said 
i do my grocery shopping all over town so i wont follow any 
routine 
her 10yearold son and 8yearold daughter are no longer 
permitted to go outside alone or to attend swimming classes 
we all feel like prisoners mrs ortiz said 
each of the professors interviewed said he or she was sure that 
government security forces are behind the terror 
the professors said they have no doubt they are being watched 
every moment and that their telephones are tapped 
two professors members of the medellin human rights commission 
were killed after arriving at the commissions headquarters for the 
first time in several days 
the meeting had been arranged by telephone said dr carlos 
gaviria a law professor 
gaviria also a member of the human rights group said he was 
supposed to have been with the two men who had been killed but had 
been delayed 
gaviria said he has taken a leave of absence from the university 
another professor was shot and killed while on his way from the 
university to a friends farm the professor had been invited by 
telephone only moments before he left the university said dr 
hoyos the law professor 
no effort has been made by authorities to investigate the 
antioquia killings as an alleged conspiracy 
as with the other similar killings in the country the crimes 
are being investigated on an individual basis 
criminal investigations in colombia are made by appointed 
judges each of whom may have hundreds perhaps thousands of other 
cases to deal with 
the government however can appoint a judge to devote all his 
time to one case if it feels the case is important enough

in five short years western europes ariane rocket 
has evolved from an old world firecracker to a redoubtable launch 
vehicle competing with americans for the multibillion dollar 
commercial space market 
with bookings worth 248 billion 42 firm orders from around 
the globe rockets are scheduled to blast off once a month 
starting sept 8 for the next 10 months and continue at a pace of 
nine launches a year 
they will put into orbit satellites for businesses and 
governments for use in improving communications weather 
forecasting telephone links or television transmission 
arianes commercial and technological success is a source of 
pride for france the rockets main backer in the 13nation 
consortium 
above all it provides a boost to the europeans late bid to 
stake a claim to outer space 
european perseverence in developing a throwaway rocket a 
dinosaur in the age of manned space flight is sweetened by the 
i told you so syndrome 
the united states which was relying exclusively on the space 
shuttle for satellite launches has not yet recovered from the 
challenger disaster jan 28 1986 but it hopes to reenter the 
picture sometime this year with a shuttle launch 
patrick baudry the french astronaut who was a crew member on a 
1985 us shuttle flight said arianes success should not be 
overstated however 
ariane is just a launcher of satellites he said in a 
telephone interview 
in the end ariane performs a mission that the russians and 
the americans have been capable of for 25 years its a technical 
success a commercial success but there is still a long way to go 
before europe is a completely adult space nation 
a latecomer to space western europe has a vision of becoming an 
independent space power 
the great nations of tomorrow will be those that can best 
master space said baudry echoing official thinking the 
success of ariane is essential for more ambitious programs it 
symbolizes the mastery of technology 
major european projects include an ariane 5 rocket capable of 
lifting a manned space shuttle hermes into orbit a decade from 
now and participation in the us manned space station project 
not all european space agency esa member nations are 
enthusiastic about the plans 
britain dissented at a ministerial meeting in november of the 
13nation agency which also is made up of austria belgium 
denmark west germany ireland italy the netherlands norway 
spain sweden and switzerland 
britains industry and trade minister kenneth clarke called 
the european plans to put men in space a hugely expensive 
industrial frolic with rather too much smacking of metooism 
for now the competition is on the ground and it is growing 
fierce 
president reagans decision to forbid commercial launches on 
future shuttle flights has given birth to a private us space 
industry once reliant on the national aeronautics and space 
administration nasa major us rocket builders must now compete 
with a slick european sales machine that has been in place eight 
years 
the soviet union also has been wooing commercial customers for 
space launches through a new organization called glavkosmos with 
slick brochures and film advertisements glavkosmos proposes to 
launch communications satellites and other payloads from foreign 
countries aboard its powerful rocket booster proton 
the first soviet commercial launch earlier this year sent up an 
indian satellite 
soviet space officials however say they are having trouble 
drumming up business because of western governments restrictions 
on the export of high technology equipment to the soviet union 
the restrictions discourage many potential customers from making 
a deal with the soviets 
a child of the european space agency the ariane 1 through 4 
series of rockets has been sold financed and launched by esas 
commercial spinoff arianespace since 1980 
billed as the worlds first commercial space transport 
company arianespace is devoted to selling space on rockets and 
placing its clients satellites into geostationary transfer orbit 
about 22000 miles from earth 
in 1987 arianespace a french company with 50 european 
shareholders who are mostly governments and staterun companies 
reported a 44 percent increase in profits over 1986 
sam mihara director of new business for the us mcdonnell 
douglas delta program credits arianespace with providing the 
worlds only available launcher after the challenger accident 
but a lot of the success of ariane was unique to the 
situation he said 
i consider ariane as the new kid on the block he said 
noting that delta rockets have been launched for 28 years what 
might be new for us is a piece of paper previously our 
customers were buying with nasa nasa was the sales agent 
mcdonnell douglas and its delta rocket general dynamics with 
its atlas centaur and martin marietta with the giant titan are the 
three rocket builders now at the heart of americas fledgling 
private space launch industry

alas regardless of their doom 
the little victims play 
no sense have they of ills to come 
nor care beyond today 
thomas gray ode on a distant prospect of eton college 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he is 3 years old wearing a red tshirt and 
boasting how his dad had taken him to see the fireworks his little 
sidekick sucks on a popsicle and shows off his purple tongue 
you cant get me daddy shouts one of the boys as he races 
playfully down the hallway of the hospital wing 
the illness that put them there is masked by their innocence and 
perfectly normal ways 
they are the children of aids 
not all are so free to run and play some come into the world 
prematurely and drugaddicted many have swollen glands sometimes 
enlarged livers and spleens their bodies are wracked by diarrhea 
and nausea burning with fever and wet from night sweats 
more than 500 of them across the united states have died of aids 
and 3000 are infected according to dr james oleske medical 
director of the childrens aids program at childrens hospital in 
newark nj 
their numbers are growing at an alarming rate in a nation 
illequipped to care for them in many places hospitals must serve 
as expensive baby sitters while foster homes are desperately sought 
for the infants 
dr martha rogers chief of pediatric and family studies for the 
aids program at the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
estimates about 10000 children under the age of 13 will be 
infected with the aids virus within a few years 
thats the low end of oleskes estimate he foresees 10000 to 
20000 infected children by 1991 i estimate that one in every 10 
to 15 hospital beds for children in the united states will be 
occupied by a child sick with aids infection that is a 
frightening statistic 
about 13 percent of the child victims got aids through tainted 
blood transfusions 
almost all the others however were doomed before birth born 
to mothers infected with the aids virus through intravenous drug 
use or through sex with a drug user six out of 10 of these 
children die by age 2 or 3 oleske said 
the tragedy is compounded when the mother is a single parent and 
unable to care for the infant because of her drug habit or because 
she is incapacitated with aids herself a grandmother may care for 
both watching both daughter and grandchild deteriorate and die 
with family members unavailable to help in many cases where 
are the increasing numbers of children born with aids going to be 
cared for oleske asked whos going to care for them 
one answer may lie in the establishment of statesupported 
transitional group homes that provide temporary care for outpatient 
children until foster homes can be found several have been set up 
in the last 18 months including homes in boston albany ny and 
elizabeth nj more are being planned 
at boston city hospital a renovated wing known as dowling 5 
south can house four children among current residents are the two 
boys whose fathers cannot care for them fulltime but who take them 
on outings like the fourth of july fireworks 
since the dowling wing opened in february 1987 the mothers of 
two children living there have died 
give me two weeks pleaded one mother and she held on long 
enough to make arrangements for the care of her child 
anne murphy a 31yearold social worker at dowling 5 south has 
seen dying mothers just coming in and spending time with their 
kids playing with them putting them to bed feeding them supper 
some of the daily routine kind of things that i think take on so 
much more meaning when you feel that your time could be limited 
for many of the chidren however the warmth of mothers and 
fathers is absent and nurses try to comfort them when they cry out 
with withdrawal pains 
some of the older children unable to understand what is 
happening to them turn to their toy doctors kits and play out 
their own tragic lives 
they give us fake shots and take our blood pressure said 
ms murphy they play out a lot of the things that happened to 
them in the hospital and kind of deal with the experience 
removed from it in a way 
many potential foster parents are reluctant to consider children 
with aids fearful or ignorant of the disease or unwilling to 
commit the extraordinary amount of time and energy required 
even so seven children from st clares home in elizabeth 
nj have been placed in foster homes said terry and faye zealand 
who founded the place of transition between hospital and foster 
care in may 1987 they plan to open two more homes in new jersey 
i cant find a cure for aids i know that i have to leave that 
up to somebody else but i know that i can provide a home for these 
children mrs zealand said 
in elizabeth and albany townspeople have been sympathetic 
local construction workers helped renovate a twostory residence 
that had been vacant for two years for st clares home at a 
zoning board hearing in albany three neighbors spoke in support of 
the farano center for children which opened in december civic 
organizations held fundraisers and donated furniture to the home 
operated by albany catholic charities 
at the farano center as many as 40 volunteers take the children 
for walks and visits to the park three of these volunters have 
become foster parents to aids children and the applications of 
four others are being considered 
the transitional homes can accommodate only a halfdozen or so 
children at a time cared for by an aroundtheclock staff 
that leaves hospitals as the only home for many children of 
aids that is costly not only to them in terms of childhood joys 
missed but also for the state each aids childs hospital stay 
costs an average 650 a day because of the extra nursing care and 
therapy required this compares for example to 240 a day at st 
clares 
some of these kids have never played with a dog or felt the 
sunshine 
everything is a sense of wonder or awe for these children 
said sister maureen joyce who runs the farano center i was 
planting some flowers and brought kids out with me they sat and 
felt the grass i had them help me plant flowers they were so 
excited 
mrs zealand recalled a 4yearold whose only playground was the 
corridors of the hospital until she moved into st clares 
i cant begin to tell you the experiences she had swinging on 
the swings in the backyard going to the parks and the 
playground said mrs zealand these are the things all kids 
need

john edkin stood on the front porch of the 
home he built with his own hands jabbing his finger in the air and 
complaining angrily about a farmhouse just 1000 yards away thats 
been proposed as a shelter for infants with aids 
hey its right in my backyard exclaimed the 67yearold 
retired woodsman i feel that we dont need them here sullivan 
county is a nice clean county and wed like to keep it that way 
like edkin many of the 630 residents of elkland township of 
which estella is a part oppose the idea of the home which would 
care for up to six philadelphiaarea children aged 2 and under 
until foster homes can be found 
elkland township residents and officials deny discrimination 
charges filed by the homes operators best nest inc of abington 
pa in its complaint with the pennsylvania human relations 
commission best nest accused the town of trying to block the home 
by amending the building code and a toxic waste ordinance and by 
excessive and burdensome review 
edkin says his biggest concern is property values in estella a 
central pennsylvania town so small it has more deer than people and 
includes only a dozen homes two churches a country store a 
nursing home and the cabins that seasonal residents use for hunting 
and weekend getaways it is about 200 miles from philadelphia 
i talked to a real estate agent after this thing first come 
in said edkin and i said to him if i told you today id 
take 30000 for my home what would you say to me he said id 
tell you id give you 15 the value of property is gone right 
down 
the 12bedroom farmhouse hidden at the top of a milelong dirt 
road in this farming and lumbering region was once a home for 
emotionally disturbed teenagers it now has a temporary license to 
house three infants a 3month old girl lives there now with her 
foster mother 
to take in more than three young children would require costly 
renovations to comply with additional state and township 
regulations township supervisors amended the building code to 
place any group home whose income is more than 15000 a year into 
a tougher fire safety classification mandating sprinkler systems 
fire walls emergency lighting and fire escapes 
the 100yearold house has none of these and pennsylvania 
officials and scott eldredge the social worker who directs best 
nest agree such renovations might be prohibitive 
townspeople and officials suggested best nest is a family 
venture out to make a buck through the 197 to 227 a day it would 
receive in government funds for each child and through a 
taxexemption it sought as a nonprofit corporation the exemption 
was denied according to kenneth levitzky the county solicitor 
after best nest failed to prove eligibility with financial data 
i havent been paid a dime for what ive done eldredge 
said i grew up in a home where there was emphasis on helping 
other people 
residents say they are being painted as the bad guys when their 
concern is the childrens safety the nearest hospital is an hour 
away they note 
clinics and doctors however are available nearby and state 
officials say it has not been clearly demonstrated that medical 
care would be a problem 
the question of the childrens race arose at a town meeting but 
betty reibson a dairy farmer and secretarytreasurer of elkland 
township said residents simply wanted all the information they 
could get 
were not trying to be discriminatory she said weve 
never said we dont want this type home were saying we want 
regulations we feel these children have the right to have the best 
facility that would provide them the care and protection they 
need 
but john edkins wife eleanor says shes heard town residents 
growl about the black people 
no blacks live in the township except for a 1yearold boy 
tested positive for aids who is the foster child of scott 
eldredges brother malcolm and his wife kim 
they live next door to the proposed group home and would run it 
if it opens the eldredge brothers parents and grandparents live 
along the same road on the other side of the proposed shelter 
malcolm and kim previously ran the home for troubled teenagers 
last year best nest bought it for 27000 from berachah farm a 
nonprofit christian group the home was closed for financial 
reasons and because of problems in setting up schooling 
commenting on the farmhouses distance from philadelphia where 
the children would come from scott eldredge said the family had 
looked for a home closer to philadelphia and if we had had the 
financial backing to purchase a home in philadelphia we would have 
done that 
we have used our own personal funds to purchase this home 
he said our goal was to buy a home already licensed as a group 
home because we knew there could be problems with discrimination 
against a home for children with aids 
of the townships opposition malcolm eldredge said i think 
its representative of a few loudmouthed people theres quite a 
few people that are very positive and say we agree with what 
youre doing we think its a good thing were behind you 
among those is grace frounfelker a 68yearold lay speaker in 
the united methodist church who was a member of the board of 
trustees of berachah farm 
it is offering a christian home and love to babies that were

a transvestite and a toddler with aidsrelated complex are 
living together in an ususual foster parenting arrangement as 
officials increasingly look to nontraditional care for a growing 
number of children with the disease 
we have to aggressively search out foster parents said 
norman reim a spokesman for the new jersey division of youth and 
family services new jersey is breaking new ground in the nation 
in the way it handles pediatric aids cases 
of the 164 new jersey children who have tested positive for the 
aids virus the majority are with relatives but 46 are in foster 
care and five are at a group home in elizabeth reim said 
his agency agreed to let a reporter visit the transvestite 
foster parent and child only on condition that their hometown and 
names not be disclosed 
bobby as the foster parent will be called here says his 
life has been fulfilling since he brought home 3yearold kevin 
in december 
they live in an old neighborhood where drug addicts and 
alcoholics hang out on street corners the toddler is never far 
from bobbys side 
ive had to cut back on entertaining my girlfriends bobby 
said referring to his transvestite friends thats the hardest 
thing but i have to be careful about who comes in now 
he acknowledges his homosexuality and his penchant for living 
like a woman and wearing feminine clothing and jewelry since 
becoming a foster parent he has stopped working as a female 
impersonator he said 
he wants kevin who doesnt know hes a man to think of his 
foster parent as an aunt 
i dont want kevin to call me mom because im not his 
mother he said if i kept him as he got older i would have to 
someday explain my lifestyle to him 
you know were all people regardless of our lifestyles 
were all gods people and the way we dress or act doesnt make us 
love any differently he said my sexual preference is 
different but nothing else is 
bobbys male companion does not live at the house but is a 
frequent visitor in the course of their relationship bobby 
decided he wanted the fulfillment of a child 
i went to see dyfs and i was a little surprised that they 
even talked to me he said they came out to inspect my home 
but i really didnt think it would go through people are 
stereotyped about gay people 
when the state approached bobby about caring for an aids child 
he was skeptical 
then i realized that these kids dont get the love they should 
get he said most people dont want sick children especially 
children with aids they see them they think theyre cute but 
they dont want them 
the first time i went to the hospital to see him i thought he 
would be a little sickly thing but hes an adorable little kid 
state officials say they dont question a foster parent 
applicants sexual preference 
when we evaluate a home we check to see if the individual or 
the people who will be parents in the home are able to provide a 
loving safe nurturing atmosphere reim said 
foster parents who care for aids children receive 700 a month 
and another stipend depending on how sick the child is compared 
with the average of 215 per month for foster children who are not 
ill reim said 
this is a new set of incentives to try and recruit foster 
parents to take care of kids with aids he said 
you also have to realize that some of these children sometimes 
need more intensive care and sometimes will require a parent to be 
home fulltime reim said you need to compensate them for 
that 
before bobby could take kevin home he had to take extensive 
lessons on how to care for an aids child rubber gloves must be 
worn when changing diapers the bathtub must be scrubbed with 
bleach after each bath kevin must be closely watched when playing 
with other children 
wearing gloves just kills me bobby said to me you pick 
up trash and garbage with rubber gloves 
but to me its basic care he said when he looks at me 
with those eyes at night and hugs me before he goes to sleep 
theres no money in the world that can buy that feeling 
one of the harshest realities however is realizing that kevin 
may not live long 
if he grows up to be 15 or 16 id be happy bobby said

in moon over parador paul mazursky reworks the prince and 
the pauper theme adds outrageous farce and produces a 
marvelously comic view of latin american politics and the acting 
profession 
mazurskys earlier career was marked by relationship 
comedydramas beginning with bob amp carol amp ted amp alice and 
continuing through next stop greenwich village an unmarried 
woman and willie and phil with down and out in beverly 
hills he broke through with a fullthrottle comedy moon over 
parador could repeat that success 
richard dreyfuss is a new york actor constantly on the prowl for 
that one starmaking role while he is playing a supporting role in 
a movie being shot on the caribbean island of parador he meets the 
dictatorpresident and does an imitation of him 
when the gourmand dictator dies of a heart attack during a 
carnival the chief of police and power behind the throne raul 
julia uncorks a daring idea dreyfuss could impersonate the late 
ruler and thus prevent a revolution under threat of death the 
actor accepts the role 
dreyfuss leaps into the impersonation performing a brilliant 
balcony speech before the populace but of course he cant deceive 
his servants who decide to go along with the scheme nor can he 
fool his mistress sonia braga who also agrees to keep his secret 
julia and his cohorts who appear to be left over from old nazi 
movies grow restless as dreyfuss begins to propose liberal 
reforms the natives are restless too and dreyfuss is nearly 
killed by bombs how he escapes from his predicament is an 
ingenious piece of scripting by mazursky and leon capetanos 
the success of moon over parador is due in large part to 
ideal casting dreyfuss brilliantly portrays the insecurities of a 
struggling actor and he proves a masterful farceur julia in a 
prussian wig is the embodiment of slick evil and braga is both 
funny and sexy 
mazursky highlights the comedy with reallife cameo appearances 
sammy davis jr sings for the carnival ike pappas plays a 
television reporter ed asner kids himself by paying a friendly 
visit to rebel camps in the mountains the only disappointment is 
the usually reliable jonathan winters his cia agent is written on 
the onenote venality that has become a movie cliche 
moon over parador is rated pg13 for bedroom scenes and 
language running time 104 minutes

videos reviewed this week good morning vietnam written 
on the wind and a tigers tale 
 
good morning vietnam touchstone home video vhsbeta 
2995 rated r 
 
robin williams was nominated for an academy award for his 
portrayal of an irreverent and raucous army deejay in saigon during 
the vietnam war though not necessarily the talented comics best 
film role to date moscow on the hudson and the world 
according to garp may have been better the movie is nonetheless 
a oneman tourdeforce 
the movie is based on the reallife antics of adrian cronauer 
williams who arrives in saigon in 1965 full of attitude and 
independence not the best combination for the military 
compulsives at armed forces radio which is languishing under an 
easylistening format 
cronauers mission is to put life into the narcoleptic station 
and that he does beginning with his first rock n roll shout of 
goooooood morning vietnam he replaces perry como and percy 
faith with james brown and jerry lee lewis the grunts love it 
military brass is appalled 
and with this popularity comes an inevitable clash with military 
censors who sanitize the news and issue propaganda directives but 
cronauer survives his critics only to tumble into the chilling 
realities of the war and the authorities who help keep it boiling 
williams is at home as a deejay obviously interspersing 
williams with cronauer in what has to be one of cinemas longest 
and greatest improvisations he is explosive enormously funny and 
warm injecting a humanity in an otherwise horrific landscape 
forest whitaker who was later tapped to portray jazz legend 
charlie parker in clint eastwoods critically acclaimed bird 
puts in an expert performance as cronauers sidekick barry 
levinsons diner direction is pristine 
good morning vietnam is a contained story there are no 
kubrick or coppolalike underpinnings and not much really goes on 
outside of cronauers fight with the military nor are there major 
looks at the bloody battles that swirled outside saigon and 
inside as well thus it is a movie that indeed works better on 
the home screen than as a theatrical release 
williams impassioned and humorous performance makes it all 
worthwhile and besides good morning vietnam is also a lot of 
fun

written on the wind mca home video vhsbeta 2995 not 
rated 
 
this 1956 universal release starring rock hudson and lauren 
bacall has become something of a camp classic a prime example of 
director douglas sirks talent for tales of overwrought passion 
contemplated calmly everything about the movie is hard to take 
seriously from the premise to the plot to the scenerychewing of 
costars dorothy malone and robert stack 
but thats missing the point forget calm forget serious sit 
back and surrender to this steamy saga of the oilrich hadley 
family and their fatal romantic frustrations odds are youll enjoy 
it though you may hate yourself in the morning 
stack plays kyle hadley the cynical alcoholic scion who falls 
hopelessly in love with bacall and marries her after a courtship so 
rapid it makes a whirlwind seem sluggish stacks best friend 
played by hudson is also hopelessly in love with bacall but 
resolves to suffer silently 
enter malone as stacks sister she is even more hopelessly in 
love than the others with hudson her unrequited passion has 
turned her into a nymphomaniac when stack develops a small 
fertility problem and bacall turns up pregnant it isnt hard for 
the malicious malone to persuade her brother his wife is fooling 
around with his pal 
needless to say before this tangled web is unraveled a lot of 
blood sweat and tears have been shed 
for her part in these carryingson malone was awarded an 
academy award as best supporting actress

in a tigers tale a 19yearold high school student named 
bubber c thomas howell falls for his girlfriends mother a 
divorced nurse named rose annmargret 
its easy to see why but why she returns his affection 
setting off an affair lacking any heat at all is only one of the 
things that doesnt make sense in this comedyromance 
theres also no good reason why roses bratty daughter kelly 
preston is allowed to get away with just about anything including 
sabotaging her mothers sex life by poking a hole in her diaphragm 
or why bubber who intends to become a veterinarian drags 
around a fullgrown tiger on a leash in smalltown texas 
and then theres the dialogue rose to bubber sometimes when 
your hairs messed up you look like a partially open can or 
bubber to rose i may be 19 but im your man and you love me and 
im going to go sleep on the couch where a dejected man is supposed 
to and it wasnt even nighttime 
annmargret tries and almost rises above her role and charles 
durning as bubbers father is good as usual but the 1987 movie

live at the whisky a gogo elektra x 
 
the songs are short the arrangements smart and the band 
rambunctious on live at the whisky a gogo x squeezes 24 songs 
into the tworecord set just about everything rocks and just 
about everything clicks 
lead guitarist tony gilkyson is the star of the show many of 
the songs such as another perfect day are built around 
gilkysons riffs and his breaks combine finesse with wild abandon 
theyre two parts rockabilly and one part machine gun 
singers john doe and exene cervenka are in top form too 
neither has a particularly appealing voice but they blend together 
well and come up with some great harmonies often when the band is 
playing at top speed 
for the uninitiated only the absence of a lyric sheet keeps 
live at the whisky a gogo from being a perfect introduction to 
x its impossible to understand what cervenka and doe are singing 
most of the time but the general theme seems to be that life is 
not a beach 
i wish it would snow in fort lauderdale or at least rain and 
hail cervenka sings on skindeep town on the worlds a 
mess she contends just that go to hell and see if you like 
it she suggests its good to know there are still a few bands 
out there with a bad attitude

no friction gramavision fool proof 
 
this wellintentioned set of back to the roots blues by a 
group of jazz players from varied backrounds reinforces two 
lessons good intentions alone rarely get you very far and its 
not easy to blend musical styles 
fool proof combines the talents of nine jazzmen brought together 
by gramavision records president jonathan rose who was dismayed 
that many new jazz musicians were neglecting their blues roots 
the result no friction though wellplayed throughout just 
doesnt measure up as a good blues record too often the jazz 
chops sound like an intrusion on the blues arrangements and 
several of the songs lack emotional punch a fatal flaw in blues 
territory 
there are a few bright spots theres a tough workout of the old 
al green hit love and happiness the only cover on the album 
red car composed by cornetist butch morris is a good jumping 
tune and saxophonist dwight andrews title nine blues has a 
certain eerie charm if you can be charmed by 719 of moody riffing 
under a recitation of lines such as red blues brown blues 
i dont recall blues 
ultimately no friction fails to satisfy one gets the 
feeling though that the musicians here will keep the spirit of 
the project alive as they resume their own diverse work which 
might say something good about good intentions after all

after his onceinalifetime role as the 
saintly indian leader in gandhi ben kingsley faced the issue 
of what to do with the rest of his career 
he solved it by returning to his roots in the theater now five 
years after his academy award he has completed five film projects 
in a year the roles range from shostakovich in testimony to 
lenin in an italian miniseries to dr watson in without a clue 
with michael caine as sherlock holmes 
kingsleys current release pascalis island has drawn 
critical praise for his carefully shaded portrayal of an informer 
on a turkishheld island in the mediterranean early in the century 
the british actor was here for the opening of pascalis 
island he is a slight semibald man whose diffident manner 
belies the onstage electricity he can generate as hamlet or in his 
oneman show about the english actor edmund kean 
the character of basil pascali is full of complexities loyalty 
vs betrayal sexual ambiguity how does kingsley explain him 
wow he exclaimed i hope i have explained him in my 
performance im always hesitant to explain its like an artist 
who paints a portrait and then he bores you by saying how he 
painted it and why the painting should speak for itself 
pascali is a very complex character hes hard to talk about 
he exists on several levels hes a spy he loves a woman and that 
love is unrequited hes a man who thinks in turkish and speaks in 
english hes a man who has a very private ambition and a private 
dream that no one knows about thats four levels already 
it was easier to play the whole composite man you know the 
story of the ant and the centipede where the ant says to the 
centipede how do you walk with all those legs and the next day 
the ant finds the centipede on his back counting his legs hed 
never thought about it before i think acting is a bit like that 
kingsley researched his role with customary thoroughness that 
included the turkish language 
apparently it is impeccable im happy to say there were some 
turks around the location on simi near rhodes between takes 
they would come up to me and speak fluent turkish i had to 
apologize and say im sorry but i can only speak the 17 lines 
that are in the screenplay he said 
i had a very good teacher in england and i had eight lessons 
of onehour long and learned it by ear like a musical score i did 
know what i was saying but i learned it phonetically 
pascalis island is directed by james dearden the man who 
wrote fatal attraction and costars charles dance the jewel 
in the crown and helen mirrin mosquito coast it was a 
reunion for kingsley and dance 
when i was in the royal shakespeare company 12 years ago 
kingsley recalled i did a play called hamlet and i played 
hamlet and charles played fortinbras we became good friends 
theater companies do bind people together its like a little army 
of people and we go over the top every night 
born in lancashire ben kingsley started in the theater at the 
top in the royal shakespeare company no spearcarrying no 
repertory he found himself performing among the most distinguished 
actors of the english theater after four years he moved to the 
royal court then the national theater in 1980 richard 
attenborough chose kingsley who is part indian for the epic 
gandhi 
after the oscar kingsley devoted himself to kean and other 
plays declining some heavy offers from hollywood 
when i won the academy award i was not too well acquainted 
with the community here he explained im a little bit more so 
now and im very fond of it but it does have an energy of its own 
that can rush you down a certain path and you can get stuck 
i have very good advisers in london new york and los angeles 
who work for the same company they field most of the things and 
they advise me very carefully so i find that i didnt burn myself 
out that five years later i can still present a variety of work 
i think what keeps me less crazy because its all relative 
is my life in the theater and going out on the stage night after 
night after night and being dependent on concentration a loyalty 
to the play and a loyalty to my fellow actors without whom you can 
achieve nothing 
everything is collaborative said kingsley i cant do 
anything on my own that i knew before i won the academy award i 
think that what gets jived up about the academy awards is how the 
winners stand up and thank everybody but its true its true 
nobody can achieve anything in my business on their own

he wore a woolen scarf and gloves in summer and 
lived like a hermit communicating with the outside world by 
telephone 
but when glenn gould died of a stroke nine days after his 50th 
birthday in 1982 canada lost not only a notorious eccentric but 
its greatest musician 
for the first time since the pianists death an exhibition at 
the national library in ottawa provides an intimate look at goulds 
life from his checkered cloth cap to the room keys he collected at 
hotels across the continent including an entire set from new 
yorks stanhope hotel 
fortunately for posterity gould was a pack rat who set aside 
one room of his apartment on torontos west st clair avenue for 
scores scripts letters programs souvenirs and assorted junk 
he wrote everything down on pads you can almost follow him 
through each day said stephen willis head of the librarys 
music manuscript collection 
a packing list reminds him to bring valium and librium for his 
nerves and a tv guide a 1966 commentary for the canadian 
broadcasting corp says provocatively in red ball point 
sometimes it seems to me that mozart has had a rather better 
press than he deserves 
a letter from his grandmother recommends a mustard pack for his 
sore back while gould commiserates with an ailing leonard 
bernstein dear leonardo by offering some tips on 
hypochondria i have several titles for diseases which i am 
expecting to have in later life but have not yet had occasion to 
make use of 
after a piano technician dislocated his shoulder with a 
backslap gould distributed a notice requesting that no one offer 
to shake his hand this will eliminate embarrassment all around 
goulds international career had a sensational start he was a 
canadian celebrity at 15 he landed a lucrative columbia records 
contract the day after his new york debut in 1955 and the first of 
more than 100 discs bachs goldberg variations is still a classic 
he suddenly abandoned the concert platform in 1964 in pursuit of 
what he saw as a purer musical experience in the recording studio 
and eventually became his own producer controlling a mixing board 
the way a conductor directs an orchestra 
he loved the microphone and dedicated much of his time to radio 
and tv documentaries including a solitude trilogy visitors can 
sample by picking up a telephone and listening to gould 
philosophize about the canadian north 
a night owl gould rented a studio at torontos inn on the park 
because it was the only place in town he could get something to eat 
in the early hours willis said 
the exhibit features goulds favorite steinway his cluttered 
pigeonhole desk and the rickety card table chair his father 
modified as a piano stool gould preferred a lowslung chair so 
that his fingers lay flat along the keyboard the antithesis of the 
pounding romantic style he abhorred 
an animal lover he left his worldly goods to the 
animalprotecting toronto humane society and salvation army the 
library was allowed to purchase the collection of 20000 items 
packed in 226 boxes on condition it organize an exhibit the 
display will tour canada later this year and negotiations are under 
way with us and european museums 
the most personal documents were withheld but willis said there 
was evidence of two or three relationships with women that did 
not last long 
in retrospect goulds career is filled with irony he searched 
for musical clarity and control in what he termed the backbone 
of a score and dismissed virtuoso playing and tonal beauty for its 
own sake 
however he marred some recordings by humming along with the 
music a habit critics considered an affectation readers will 
find the groans and croons intolerable the penguin guide says of 
one bach recording 
gould preferred the piano to the harpsichord and played no part 
in the rediscovery of original instruments and pitch that has 
revolutionized baroque listening in the 1980s 
he saw nothing wrong with splicing dozens of takes for one 
definitive performance and envisioned an era when recordings 
adjusted electronically by home listeners would entirely replace 
public concerts 
yet even with todays digital compact discs most performers and 
listeners favor spontaneous complete takes and concert hall 
acoustics 
despite reservations gould holds an olympian place in canadian 
music

holly knight believes in the power of a good 
song 
if people like the artist but not the songs they wont buy 
the record said knight who has written the hits never for 
heart love touch for rod stewart and better be good to me 
for tina turner 
if you go to concerts you can see the reactions of people 
when they go into a song they like or know they sing and dance and 
go nuts as soon as they recognize the hit they stand up 
but after years of catapulting others to the limelight knight 
is seeking some recognition of her own she has just released her 
debut album holly knight and is counting on the strength of 
her writing to attract a following 
i liked the songs so much that when i handed the record over 
to the label i really didnt mind what song they picked for the 
single she said 
knight grew up in new york wanting to be a rock star more than a 
songwriter she began playing music at age 4 and was performing 
live as a teenager her talent as a songwriter emerged while she 
was a member of the groups spider and device 
my songs were starting to be the singles and get more 
attention when i left the group device i thought id write a 
song here or there and give them to people she said 
her first hit came in 1983 with love is a battlefield 
recorded by pat benatar knight does a softer version of the song 
on her own album 
i really like pattis version of it it gives people a chance 
to see how you can take the same song and make it sound really 
different she said 
knight is pleased with all the interpretations of her songs 
pointing out that the demos were similar to the finished product 
she singled out tina turner for you better be good to me 
i think the vocal delivery really suited her better be good 
to me suited her it suited her psychologically i think she did 
such a great job delivering it because she really meant it 
knight said 
her singing style is reminiscent of dusty springfield best 
known for such popsoul songs as son of a preacher man and i 
only want to be with you knight said she doesnt try to sound 
like any of her favorite singers but admires their approach 
daryl hall i was influenced by him aretha franklin a lot of 
my favorite singers are great but not technically brilliant 
knight coproduced her album with chris lordalge who has 
worked with bruce springsteen peter gabriel madonna and stevie 
nicks 
he lordalge was very encouraging she said i purely 
went on instinct with him everything he said was right along the 
lines of what i was thinking 
the album has a lush pop sound and little overdubbing was used 
its not 48 tracks knight said i did try to get three 
singers singing at once but i couldnt use any of it because it 
sounded too big it sounds rich because there isnt a lot of stuff 
on there so it gives room for whats on there to breathe 
still songwriting is what knight is known for and the songs on 
her album were worked on over a long period of time i may take 
months and months to write a song i might work on it and then 
leave it for a while and then go back to it 
knights writing is influenced by the motown and stax sounds of 
the 1960s 
i owned a supremes record before i owned a beatles record 
she said im doing some new songs now on one part i wanted to 
put horns on the horns sounded really out of tune they had that 
memphis sound lazy outoftune horns i was responding to those 
songs 
anyone hoping to turn an unrecorded knight song into a hit will 
be disappointed she is not prolific 
im not the kind of writer that writes 40 songs and a few 
become hits just about every song i write has become a hit 
knight said i dont put a lot out there in general people call 
me and want to know if i have a tune sitting around and i really 
dont 
knight wants to tour but will probably wait until next year 
she points out again how important it is for the audience to 
recognize the songs 
id like to have a couple of top 10s so people will know some 
of the music its going to be more exciting for them as well as me 
if people know the music 
its down to that again when you recognize a tune you dance 
and get into it it helps tide me over people are very comfortable 
with familiarity

thufferin thuccotash 
mel ahsaymel blanc the voice behind bugs daffy tweety 
porky woody and almost every cartoon character from here to 
cucamonga is 80 years old and has just written an autobiography 
blanc in a warmhearted and fascinating new book thats not 
all folks my life in the golden age of cartoons and radio 
warner books 1795 says warner bros produced 1003 cartoons 
and he voiced 848 of them 
his favorite character reached by telephone at his los angeles 
home blanc answered in the voice of brooklyns most famous bunny 
everybody knows who i am doc i dont cayuh where dey are or 
who dey are even up in mars dey know about me heheheheh 
bugs thats my favorite character i even have him tatooed on 
my shirt 
the looney tunes and merrie melodies churned out by 
warner bros in a dank office dubbed termite terrace by blanc and 
his cartooning coworkers had their heydey from the 1930s to the 
mid50s 
rerun countless times they are arguably still the funniest 
things on television they parodied film stars from humphrey bogart 
to katharine hepburn tweaked politicians and contained salty 
hilarious characters that are a far cry from the phoney unfunny 
goodygoodies and baddybaddies that populate todays junkfood tv 
cartoon shows 
the boxoffice success this summer of who framed roger 
rabbit a mysteryfantasy in which cartoon characters must 
contend with the human world proves that the public still eats up 
good animation 
blanc in fact did the voices of daffy duck tweety bird bugs 
bunny and sylvester the cat in roger rabbit but he says he 
hasnt seen the film yet 
cartoon connoisseurs will find plenty of little known facts to 
relish in blancs autobiography cowritten by philip bashe 
just a few samples 
the theme music for warner bros cartoons is a tune called 
the merrygoround broke down 
voice characterizations are done first not the pictures to 
the surprise of many 
a single sixminute warner bros cartoon took four or five 
artists sketching about 16000 pictures and 60 backgrounds 
bugs bunny in his earliest incarnation in the late 30s was 
called happy rabbit blanc hated the name and in 1940 he 
changed it to bugs he decided to give him a toughguy brooklyn 
accent even though blanc grew up in san francisco and portland 
ore and to this day has never set foot in brooklyn 
he may love bugs but blanc hated raw carrots he chewed them 
for the sound effects and filled trash cans with halfmunched 
carrots 
the hardest voice characterization for blanc was yosemite sam 
since it had to be done at a constant holler sylvester was the 
easiest because he sounded closest to blancs natural voice except 
for the exaggerated lisp 
after the demise of termite terrace blanc went on to do more 
modern cartoon characters made famous on tv from barney rubble on 
the flintstones series to the frito bandito 
blanc gained more fame than fortune from his cartoon 
characterizations the most warner bros ever paid him for being 
the voice behind their cartoons was 20000 
the only hint of bitterness in his autobiography is about the 
way warners copyrighted the voices of the cartoon characters blanc 
made famous it means he cant publicly say whats up doc or 
i tawt i taw a puddytat or such phrases he invented without 
getting the studios permission 
that is true he said over the phone i worked for them 
and i did these voices and they in turn copyrighted the voices and 
trademarked them i wanted to keep working for them so i didnt 
say anything i was a jerk i should have said something at the 
time 
he did considerably better financially as a radio and tv 
personality for years on the jack benny program he did the sound 
effects for the wheezing old maxwell that the skinflint comedian 
supposedly drove most famous of all he played the train depot 
caller who broke up audiences with train leaving on track five 
for anaheim azusa and cucamonga 
blanc says at the end of his book that while he may not last 
forever he has plans to allow his cartoon characters to live on 
a lot of people try to copy my voice but theres only one guy 
who can do my voice and make it actually make it sound like me and 
thats my son noel he said 
age and the emphysema which forces him to use oxygen at night 
have fortunately not impaired the gifted larynx of the man of a

the thought of retiring is as daffy would say dethpicable 
you know i dont think ill ever stop until im dead he 
says i have to have a driver now he drives me to work either 
to warner bros or one of the studios in town i allow two hours

when dr abraham n lieberman gives talks about 
brain transplants he flashes two faces on the screen albert 
einstein and moe of the three stooges 
people have gotten used to the idea of shifting kidneys livers 
even hearts from person to person but the seat of intellect and 
personality is unquestionably special 
despite his illustration of the differences brainwise between 
people lieberman says the organ is just as transferable as others 
brain is tissue and it can be transplanted as tissue the way 
liver and kidney can he says 
doctors arent swapping whole brains or even thinking seriously 
about it but they have taken the first tentative steps toward 
transplanting small parts of brains or related tissue from 
elsewhere in the body or from fetuses to cure the ills of the 
bodys most important and mysterious organ 
although such therapy has just begun the ethical thickets 
surrounding it are already being explored mainly because of one 
big and unresolved question where will the brains come from 
lieberman is a neurologist at new york university where doctors 
are trying to reverse parkinsons disease by removing 
chemicalproducing tissue from the adrenal glands and implanting it 
in the victims brains 
at vanderbilt university in tennessee doctors have used a 
similar approach to treating huntingtons disease 
some day brain transplants may control a variety of other 
degenerative disorders including alzheimers disease for now 
most of the early testing is centered on parkinsons a reasonable 
place to start unlike many other brain diseases it is limited to 
a small region of the brain and its underlying complexities are 
fairly well understood 
it also is one of the most common brain diseases between 
500000 and 1 million americans including 2 percent of everyone 
over 70 have parkinsons once it was considered to be exclusively 
a disease of the elderly but it is being diagnosed increasingly in 
younger people even in their 20s and 30s 
parkinsons results from gradual destruction of a part of the 
brain called the nigral tissue which makes an essential 
messagecarrying chemical dopamine 
victims often suffer tremors and have trouble controlling their 
movements some find it hard to stand unaided and walk if at all 
with short shuffling steps patients may even be unable to hold 
their heads erect 
there is no cure the disease is slowly progressive although 
its worst effects can be held off for a few years with levodopa and 
other drugs 
the goal of brain surgery is to replace the damaged tissue so 
the brain will make its own dopamine again there are several 
sources of tissue aborted fetuses living organ donors the dead 
and the victims own body 
the most common approach in parkinsons is to transfer 
dopaminemaking tissue from one place to another in the patient 
the adrenal glands which lie above the kidneys also produce 
dopamine so doctors implant adrenal tissue in the patients brain 
at a conference at the clinical research center at massachusetts 
institute of technology dr peter mcl black of brigham and 
womens hospital here said at least 11 us medical centers have 
performed this kind of operation on 70 people 
its not a miracle cure he said about half are better to 
some degree and 10 percent are convincingly improved 
lieberman said the most impressive of his 11 patients is a 
doctor who could not walk or even stand before the surgery 
although he is far from cured he can walk unassisted live alone 
and go outside 
the patients wife left him before he got sick but returned to 
care for him when he began to deteriorate after surgery he 
improved to the point that all the old animosities between them 
returned and she left again 
lieberman said the surgery is in such an early crude stage that 
doctors are unsure exactly what tissue to transplant where to put 
it or what it does 
its like we are giving bread mold to people and dont even 
know what penicillin is he said thats the level we are at 
it is the only hope for some people who are going downhill and 
no longer respond to medicine 
but there are drawbacks beyond the mediocre results so far it 
is expensive 30000 to 100000 depending on where the surgery 
is done and it is such a grueling procedure actually two major 
operations on the abdomen and the head that many elderly 
parkinsons victims are simply too sick to stand it 
lieberman said one woman suffered 25 major complications 
including cardiac arrest and was in the hospital seven months i 
cant tell you that she is any better than when she went into the 
hospital but shes not any worse 
to improve the outcome doctors are considering other 
potentially better tissue sources one is adrenal glands from 
young kidney donors another is fetuses 
in january dr ignacio madrazo and colleagues from la raza 
medical center in mexico city said they obtained dramatic results 
after transplanting brain and adrenal tissue from a spontaneously 
aborted fetus into two parkinsons victims earlier this month 
they said one of them had improved enough to go job hunting 
since then the operation also has been done at the midland 
center for neurosurgery and neurology in england researchers at 
the university of lund in sweden reported that after six months 
their first two patients showed no significant improvement 
some experts believe that in people tissue from aborted fetuses 
will work better than adrenal tissue from the patients own body 
it would eliminate the need for surgery to gather the tissue and 
because its so immature it might adapt better to its new locale 
lunds dr anders bjorklund has experimented with rats that have 
parkinsons which resolves when fetal tissue is implanted and 
returns when it is removed he has even successfully given them 
human fetal tissue 
however a human needs far more fetal tissue bjorklund noted 
there is a real problem of how to scale up the procedure we 
dont know if we can obtain enough material to do meaningful 
trials in humans 
some biotechnology companies are looking for ways to mass 
produce the fetal tissue in cell cultures 
animal studies suggest other possible uses for fetal brains 
when given to infertile mice that lack an essential hormone the 
animals became able to reproduce fetal brain tissue also improved 
the memories of old rats 
dr kenneth j ryan of brigham and womens said he doesnt see 
any overwhelming ethical barriers to transplanting tissue from 
aborted human fetuses what would bother people about this its 
dead fetal tissue that is going to be thrown away anyway 
however researchers at the national institutes of health have 
been prohibited from using aborted fetal tissue in transplants 
until an advisory committee can think through the ethical medical 
and legal issues involved 
some have worried that women might abort fetuses so the tissue 
can be used in sick relatives or might even sell their fetuses for 
medical use 
however ryan said he believes that such excesses can be 
avoided i always believe we can draw the line and say we will 
use it this way

children in rochester minn are about twice as 
likely to get the most serious form of diabetes as those in san 
diego or alabama but face only twothirds the risk of finnish 
children according to new research 
the risk of insulindependent diabetes unexplainably varies 
17fold across 14 nations studied running generally higher in 
cooler climates 
scientists are studying such differences for clues to a far more 
basic question just what causes insulindependent diabetes 
the disease occurs because the insulinproducing cells of the 
pancreas have been destroyed by a misguided attack by the bodys 
immune system the 1 million americans with it must inject 
themselves with insulin every day to stay alive otherwise sugar 
will build up in their blood and cause such complications as heart 
and kidney disease blindness and nerve damage 
genes clearly play a key role in triggering the immune systems 
attack the vast majority of people who develop insulindependent 
diabetes have particular genes linked to the disease 
however most people with the susceptible genetic background do 
not develop diabetes and the geographic variation in rates is 
evidence of an environmental role said ronald laporte associate 
professor in the epidemiology department at the university of 
pittsburgh 
studies also suggest that rates for american children younger 
than 15 more than doubled from 1947 to 1976 which argues for a 
change in the environment said james warram of the joslin diabetes 
center in boston 
what could this environmental factor be 
viral infections are one theory since viruses show seasonal and 
temperature preferences as does insulindependent diabetes diet is 
another proposed trigger with some support from animal studies 
the question is complicated because the immune system starts 
attacking the pancreas years before a person shows diabetes 
symptoms so any trigger must have acted at some unknown time in 
the past said jerome i rotter of cedarssinai medical center in 
los angeles 
rotter also said much of the geographic difference in rates may 
be due to differing prevalence of the susceptibility genes in 
various populations rather than just environmental causes 
geographic differences are highlighted in a new study by an 
international team of scientists who compared insulindependent 
diabetes rates in children under age 15 from 14 countries their 
work appears in the august issue of the journal diabetes 
rates ranged from 17 cases per 100000 personyears in 
hokkaido japan to 295 cases per 100000 personyears in finland 
a personyear is like a manhour it represents the equivalent of 
following one person for one year 
within the united states the rates per 100000 personyears 
also showed variation 94 in san diego 114 in jefferson county 
ala 134 in allegheny county penn 151 in colorado 178 in 
north dakota and 208 in rochester 
the studys overall variation was most pronounced for children 
younger than 5 suggesting the unknown environmental agent may 
exert more influence in that population said laporte it seems 
to be affecting the youngest children the most whatever it is

a voluntary monitoring program by testtube baby 
clinics may help infertile couples avoid those that misrepresent 
their success 
more than 3000 testtube babies have been born in the united 
since the worlds first louise brown was born 10 years ago in 
england 
yet the success rate remains low 
only 17 percent of attempts led to pregnancies in 1986 the 
latest year for which figures are available through the monitoring 
program operated under the auspices of the society for assisted 
reproductive technology and its parent organization the american 
fertility society 
and the odds are that a quarter of those pregnancies didnt 
succeed says dr martin quigley of the cleveland clinic 
foundation vice president of sart whose members are doctors 
practicing in vitro fertilization and related techniques 
the congressional office of technology assessment reported in 
june that at least half of the nations approximately 170 testtube 
baby clinics have never sent a woman home with a baby congress is 
considering whether it should require individual clinics to release 
their success rates 
there tends to be an exaggeration of the success rate says 
quigley clinics can count very early pregnancies as successes for 
example even though at least half will not result in a baby he 
says 
the stakes are high a single in vitro fertilization attempt 
costs 4000 to 6000 and many couples try several times 
infertile couples who know what to ask can avoid being taken in 
by a clinics inflated statistics says dr alan decherney 
president of the sart 
the right questions are how many cycles fertilization 
attempts has the clinic done how many live babies has it 
produced what is the success rate per cycle how do they deal with 
various forms of infertility 
the most reliable statistic is the number of clinical 
pregnancies those that produce a missed period per number of 
attempts says decherney director of the testtube baby clinic at 
yale university in new haven conn 
clinics that do more in vitro fertilizations as represented by 
the number of cycles theyve done generally are more successful 
than newer smaller clinics decherney says 
the monitoring program in which about 115 clinics participate 
doesnt provide information on individual clinics but does give 
national figures and a clinics voluntary membership means it has 
met certain standards and serves as a check on the accuracy of its 
success rate 
if i see a discrepancy in success rates pregnancy or live 
births you can believe that im going to raise a question says 
stuart hartz of medical research international in burlington 
mass who directs the program 
ann petter executive director of resolve inc in arlington 
mass a national advocacy organization for infertile couples says 
in vitro fertilization should be a last resort 
its gotten so much publicity and so much glamor that people 
are leaping to thinking its the solution whereas there are a lot 
of other things they could do first petter says 
she recommends that couples unable to have children first get a 
complete infertility workup to determine the cause of their 
infertility 
resolve runs a referral service with names of infertility 
experts across the country and distributes information on 
infertility and the procedures to correct it including in vitro 
fertilization

a massive vaccination drive launched by the world 
health organization in may could rid most of the world of polio by 
1995 five years ahead of the whos target for global eradication 
an official says 
however that will still leave desperately poor countries whose 
basic vaccine delivery system has to be brought up to speed 
said dr ralph henderson director of the whos expanded program on 
immunization 
about 120 countries with a total population of 41 billion are 
to be included in the vaccination drive only 56 percent of 
children are immunized against polio in the third world where it 
is the main cause of lameness 
more work will be needed henderson said in about 20 countries 
including bangladesh vietnam cambodia and several in africa some 
800 million people live in areas where less than half the 
population is immunized 
the annual cost of fighting polio measles diphtheria whooping 
cough tetanus and tuberculosis is 150 million and who expects to 
need another 100 million to 500 million over the next decade just 
for the polio campaign 
the effort is due to be reviewed in december henderson said 
some 275000 youngsters catch the disease every year mostly in 
poor countries for lack of immunization that costs 10 us cents 
the virus attacks the central nervous system in severe cases 
causing paralysis one paralyzed child out of 10 dies and most of 
the rest are affected for life 
past third world drives make who believe most countries will be 
poliofree by 1995 henderson said the antismallpox drive a 
decade ago gives enormous inspiration and many many lessons 
for the polio effort but breaking the polio chain of transmission 
will be much more difficult he said 
infected people are highly contagious for three weeks but only 
one case in 100 is strong enough to be diagnosed and while 
smallpox requires close contact to catch polio can be transmitted 
through polluted food and water

concerted intervention this week to curb the dollars rise 
traders in italy said the market wasnt being led by hard 
economic facts or news but by statements from public officials and 
a gut feeling that the reagan administration wants a strong dollar 
to help the presidential candidacy of george bush 
this is a market led by declarations us secretary of 
commerce william verity says one thing the white house another 
and the market reacts accordingly said a senior dealer in milan 
veritys statement last week that a lower dollar is needed if 
the us is to right its massive trade imbalance had triggered a 
fall in the us currency 
one dealer at a us bank in frankfurt said the dollars 
recovery and current strength raised the chances that the deutsche 
bundesbank west germanys central bank will raise its discount 
rate at a meeting on thursday 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 048 yen to a closing 13388 yen later in

prices fell on the tokyo stock exchange today as 
some investors feared higher interest rates worldwide traders 
said the dollar closed higher 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues which gained 
8006 points friday lost 13024 points or 046 percent to close at 
2807918 trading was moderate on the exchanges first section 
with volume at 600 million shares 
on the foreign exchange market the dollar closed at 13388 yen 
up 048 yen from fridays close after staying in a narrow range 
between 13380 yen and 13395 yen 
dealers said the yendollar exchange rate appeared to be stuck 
within the 133134 yen range 
this is because investors are likely to sell the dollar if the 
us currency touches the 134yen level and are likely to sell the 
currency if it approaches the 133yen level said an exchange 
dealer at a major bank in tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity

although some complained about the lack 
of a salary hike united steelworkers members at lukens steel co 
approved a threeyear contract that includes 2400 in bonuses and 
a new profit sharing program 
negotiators for local 1165 and lukens reached a tentative 
agreement thursday just hours before the 1400 usw members planned 
to start manning picke lines on saturday members voted 617451 to 
approve the contract 
a lot of guys dont like it steelworker jack entrekin said 
after the agreement was explained to members of course how they 
talk and how they vote are two different things 
a number of union members were upset at the apparent tradeoff 
of profit sharing for a straight hourly raise because lukens has 
earned substantial profits in the past year officials said 
last years earnings of 466 million were more than double the 
previous years figure 
i voted against it said edward stanley who has worked at 
the mill since 1965 slavery days are over 
in addition to the bonuses and profit sharing the agreement 
calls for better medical and insurance benefits according to union 
officials 
the first profitsharing plan for hourly employees would pay 
steelworkers an extra 89 cents an hour based on company earnings 
for the first six months of 1988 union officials said 
lukens steelworkers earn an average of 30000 a year according 
to the company 
john washington a crane operator said he wanted to see an 
acrosstheboard raise 
we dont know what the steel industry is going to do 
washington said the bottom could drop out tomorrow 
harry haines president of local 1165 said lukens strongly 
opposed a straight hourly wage increase because it automatically 
would raise the companys costs for benefits and overtime 
he shared the feelings of some union members who turned thumbs 
down while walking in the rain to vote at the union hall saturday 
we told them we couldnt endorse it haines said it was 
our best effort but not the companys 
haines said the agreement provides for a 1000 signing bonus 
to be paid in september workers also will receive bonuses of 800 
and 600 in the second and third years of the contract 
the bonuses are guaranteed although payments in the final two 
years would be deducted from any profitsharing the workers earn 
wr wilson chairman and president of lukens inc the steel 
companys parent firm said it was his expectation and hope that 
the steelworkers will do very well under the profitsharing plan 
the union had worked under an extended contract since september 
1986 but canceled the extension last week

rising sea levels caused by the worlds 
warming will have catastrophic effects on many small pacific 
islands and some may vanish underwater an international congress 
of scientists was told monday 
the impact of the socalled greenhouse effect was one of 
many problems highlighted on the opening day of the 26th congress 
of the international geographic union 
the weeklong meeting of 1200 scientists from 55 countries is 
the largest ever held in the southern hemisphere the last congress 
was held in paris four years ago organizers said that more than 
700 scientific papers would be presented this week 
scientists said the buildup of manmade gases will cause sea 
levels to rise by about one meter 33 feet within a century 
swamping many lowlying coral atolls such as kiribati formerly 
the gilbert islands and tuvalu the two nations have a combined 
population of about 68000 
also at risk are the maldives in the indian ocean as well as the 
marshall islands and tokelau in the pacific ocean said a paper 
presented by peter roy and john connell of australias department 
of mineral resources and sydney universitys department of 
geography respectively 
the experience will be catastrophic for some people said 
roy 
not only would there be very little higher ground for the 
population to retreat to but fresh water on the islands was likely 
to dry up destroying the ecology he said 
the scientists suggested immediate attention be given to 
engineering works to keep the sea at bay 
increased migration to high islands and overseas is the 
single most probable outcome of rising sea levels the congress 
was told some of the most recently populated islands are likely 
to be depopulated and even abandoned as a new class of 
environmental refugee is superimposed on that of economic 
refugee 
brian walker chief ecologist of the australian governments 
main science body the commonwealth science and industrial 
research organization cautioned there would be some beneficial 
effects to the widely held prediction of catastrophe 
for example icefree sea lanes have an impact walker said 
in an interview the fact is there will be a great deal of change 
but im not saying it will be predominantly bad 
however canadian geographer dr roger tomlinson of ottowa said 
a major task was to compile a data bank of existing knowledge about 
changes that are likely to occur 
it is a gargantuan task he told the associated press we 
would need a computer 40000 times more powerful than anything that 
exists now to understand the impact on humans is not going to be 
easy just to put the information down on paper would stand some 60 
miles 96 kilometers high 
meanwhile prof nicholas polunin of the world council for 
biosphere in geneva switzerland said the world is reeling under 
at least 20 identified menaces the worst of which is too many 
people 
he said the threats range from overpopulation and nuclear 
holocaust to destruction of the ozone shield and human epidemics 
such as aids 
yet basic to the vast majority is the problem of human 
overpopulation which in various ways is strangling the world he 
said 
polunin said the threat of nuclear warfare a nuclear winter 
and nuclear accidents was the number one horror which could bring 
life to a standstill with littls hope of ever recovering while 
destruction of the stratospheric ozone shield which filters off 
most of the harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun already was 
resulting in increased skincancers 
other menaces according to polunin include the greenhouse 
effect global warming due to the increasing buildup of carbon 
dioxide methane and other trace gases as well as deforestation 
devegetation and desertification depletion of raw materials 
insufficient agricultural land sealevel rising through floods 
widespread excessive pollutions and climatic variations

wickes cos plans to sell itself in 
a deal valued at nearly 26 billion to a management group headed 
by chairman sanford sigoloff who led the retailing giant out of 
bankruptcy three years ago 
the 12 pershare offer announced sunday is nearly 3 higher 
than wickes closing stock price of 937 friday on the new york 
stock exchange it appeared to reflect sigoloffs frustration at 
failing to boost the companys stock price and profits through a 
restructuringandacquisition strategy 
based in santa monica wickes is one of the largest suppliers to 
the automobile industry the worlds biggest producer of wall 
coverings and major retailer of home improvement products 
wii holdings corp a firm sigoloff established with members of 
his management team will offer to purchase nearly 40 million of 
wickes 498 million shares as well as assume its debt of 206 
billion the deal values wickes at nearly 26 billion 
but sigoloff said in a statement that the agreement was 
structured in such a way that higher offers from other potential 
bidders were still possible 
while we believe that our offer is fair both management and 
the board want to ensure that the companys shareholders obtain the 
best price for their shares sigoloff said in a prepared 
statement 
the offer was publicized in conjunction with an announcement 
that wickes lost 124 million for the second quarter ending july 
30 compared with earnings of 189 million a year earlier 
the major participants in wii holdings will be institutional 
investors including the wall street firm drexel burnham lambert 
inc which will arrange much of the financing wickes spokesman 
michael sitrick said 
in 1982 wickes became what was then the largest us company to 
file for bankruptcy protection blaming the move on an excessive 
debt load deteriorating relationships with creditors and declining 
profits 
about three years later the giant retailer was back on its feet 
after selling 13 of its 32 divisions and winning creditor approval 
for a plan allowing wickes to emerge from bankruptcy court 
the force behind the comeback was sigoloff who earned the 
nickname ming the merciless for the toughminded business moves 
and hardnosed cost cutting 
with a reputation for working up to 16 hours a day sigoloff got 
a break when wickes creditors allowed him to pay off 121 billion 
in debt with 289 million in cash 524 million in debt securities 
and an 82 percent share of the reorganized company 
part of the companys postbankruptcy struggle has been blamed 
on sigoloffs strategy of issuing more debt to raise cash for other 
acquisitions some of which ended in costly failure 
in april 1986 for example wickes bid more than 12 billion 
for the national gypsum co a dallasbased building supplier the 
bid collapsed when national gypsum was acquired by its management 
wickes also failed in a 21 billion hostile bid for the 
owenscorning fiberglas corp and a 17 billion bid for lear 
siegler inc an aerospace and automotive equipment concern

saudi tycoon adnan khashoggi has agreed to 
pay up to 35 million to triad america corp his bankrupt us 
holding company under a tentative settlement reached by attorneys 
and trustees a newspaper reported 
danny kelly an attorney for triad america trustee r todd 
neilson declined to comment on the size of the settlement but 
anonymous sources quoted in the salt lake tribune monday said the 
amount was 30 million to 35 million 
i think it is the best settlement we could have gotten and i 
dont think there was any money left on the table neilson was 
quoted as saying 
im basically pleased we were able to secure this money we 
started this estate without a single dollar in it and we will end 
up with millions of dollars to pay creditors he added 
triad america a holding company of khashoggi and his brother 
essam and eight affiliated companies filed for protection under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in january 1987 listing 
liabilities of 1975 million and assets of 95 million 
the tentative settlement reached friday after a day of 
negotiations and subject to approval by us bankruptcy court 
would allow unsecured creditors to be paid 40 to 50 cents on the 
dollar barring any unforeseen complications kelly said 
triad americas major unsecured creditors include sheraton 
corp texaco inc and the department of energy in addition 20 
other unsecured creditors have claims of more than 1 million 
kelly said 
he estimated triads and its affiliates debt to creditors at 
50 million to 75 million 
we are not done looking for other money to repay creditors 
kelly said there are potentially other sources of money to 
enhance this this still is not in a bank account in utah and a 
lot of things still could happen 
kelly said the trustee must satisfy certain conditions before 
khashoggi is obligated to pay the money but he would not comment 
on those conditions 
the 30 million to 35 million would go to the bankruptcy estate 
of triad america 
the trustees intent ideally would be to get an interim 
distribution to creditors as soon as possible kelly said but 
the bankruptcy court first must determine which creditors have 
legitimate claims 
it still could be years before the case is actually closed and 
final payments are made he said 
the tentative agreement would settle a lawsuit filed against the 
khashoggi brothers by neilson in october 1987 the suit which also 
named more than 40 companies directly or indirectly owned by the 
pair sought 239 million in actual damages and 800 million in 
punitive damages for breach of contractual obligations and 
fiduciary duties 
adnan khashoggi indirectly owns 80 percent of triad america 
while essam khashoggi indirectly owns 20 percent of the company 
triad america obtained a court order freezing the khashoggis 
assets in the united states and attaching specific us assets 
including a 515 million judgment against northrop corp 
the order said neilson was clearly what brought them to the 
table the companys lien on the judgment will be released the 
minute the money hits our account he said 
the judgment against northrop the los angelesbased aircraft 
and arms manufacturer stemmed from commissions on sales to the 
saudi air force and interest 
northrop has been in litigation with adnan khashoggi over the 
commissions for years the us supreme court refused to hear an 
appeal by northrop last year but kelly said northrop still had 
some alternatives and theoretically could have tried to get out 
from the judgment 
the triad america settlement follows negotiations over a 
tentative settlement with northrop in which the company would pay 
485 million but dan berman khashoggis local attorney said the 
two agreements were not connected

the canadian government cannot make chrysler corp 
recall 120000 cars that may violate pollution laws even though the 
company recalled 492000 cars for a similar reason in the united 
states officials said 
chrysler cars built between 1986 and early 1987 with 22litre 
and 25litre engines were recalled in the united states in april 
1987 because a flawed fuel injector caused some cars to emit black 
smoke which violated american pollution laws 
but canadian authorities cannot force a similar recall because 
until september 1987 canadian emission laws were far less 
stringent than those in the united states according to chryslers 
canadian subsidiary which has refused a request by transport 
canada to recall the cars 
we met with chrysler in july says david gourley of the 
departments energy emissions branch but they said there was no 
reason to recall the cars because they met canadian standards at 
the time the cars were sold 
a chrysler canada ltd spokesman said friday the company cant 
afford to recall old cars to comply with new laws 
where would you draw the line on something like that 1902 
the spokesman asked 
most chrysler kcars including plymouth reliants and dodge 
aries were among the models recalled in the united states 
canadian emissioncontrol laws for passenger cars were changed 
in september to meet standards the united states has used since 
1981 
chrysler extended its fuelinjector warranty on the questioned 
models to 80000 kilometres from 20000 kilometres in february 
in the meantime gourley says the only way to force chrysler to 
recall the cars is to take the automaker to court where his branch 
would need a smoking guna smoking chrysler to win its case

restored early today to about 22300 gte north inc customers after 
cables were cut deliberately in three rivers company officials

it was the latest of about 50 acts of vandalism to gte telephone 
equipment since last week when 2200 union employees struck the

gte provides telephone service to 500000 michigan customers in 58 
of the states 83 counties 
the company usually has about 24 cases of vandalism in a year 
kinney said 
we have no idea who is doing it and we wont speculate 
kinney said but theres no question the damage is intentional 
kinney said the cases were being reported to the appropriate law 
enforcement officials most cases involve cut telephone cables or 
damaged telephone equipment 
local 116 of the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
called the strike after contract negotiations collapsed last 
tuesday 
union spokesman keith flewelling said today the union takes no 
responsibility for the reported damage 
im certain that the company is blaming our striking workers 
for it but obviously we dont condone vandalism flewelling 
said what we want to do is get back to the bargaining table 
no new talks have been scheduled 
in the latest case of vandalism about 26000 customers in eight 
southwest michigan communities were left without longdistance 
service from 1 am to 7 am today after someone cut four cables 
at a longdistance switching center at three rivers kinney said 
he said some parts of those communities rely on longdistance 
service to reach their sheriffs department or nearest hospital 
kinney said repair crews still were trying to restore service to 
about 3700 customers in the constantine and white pigeon areas

soybean corn and oat futures plunged their 
permitted daily limits early in todays session on the chicago 
board of trade in reaction to heavy overnight rainfall overnight in 
western and central iowa 
wheat futures also were sharply lower 
rain was headed east into the central corn belt where a 
summerlong drought has wreaked severe damage on the corn and 
soybean crops 
but analysts said the rain was coming too late to greatly 
benefit the crops corn plants passed their most vulnerable period 
in midjuly and most of the soybean crop is past the critical 
podsetting stage 
this rain should not really do that much damage to prices we 
might see a rally said victor lespinasse a trader in chicago 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
corn and oat futures are limited to daily moves of 10 cents a 
bushel the wheat limit is 15 cents and the soybeans are limited to 
moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the august soybean contract 
which has no limit pending its expiration today

stock prices drifted lower this morning as 
traders showed little conviction about prospects for the economy 
inflation or interest rates 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which fell 1103 on 
friday and 2152 for the week was off 035 at 201565 at noontime

big board volume came to 6164 million shares as of noon on wall

trading volume has been sluggish in recent days as investors 
have shunned the market while trying to figure out where the 
economy is headed and what the prospects are for inflation and 
interest rates 
the economic indicators have been generally strong a 
development which might normally support stock prices 
but the pace of economic growth has raised concerns about a 
resurgence of inflation and speculation that the federal reserve 
may take new steps to choke off a price rise by pushing interest 
rates higher 
higher rates would make the yields available on bonds more 
attractive 
later this week the government plans to report on consumer 
prices in july and secondquarter economic growth 
stock prices opened higher but quickly changed direction as 
bond prices slipped yields on the closelywatched 30year treasury 
bond edged up past the 940 percent mark after finishing below that 
level last week 
charles jensen a technical analyst for mki securities corp 
said todays decline in stock prices was a continuation of a

although it has plenty of oil natural 
gas coal and other sources of energy indonesia is considering a 
nuclear power plant as a backstop against the day when the other 
resources wont be enough 
supporters of the nuclear option say the country has little 
choice since electricity demand on the main island of java is 
expected to increase more than sixfold by the year 2015 java is 
home for more than 60 percent of indonesias 170 million people and 
uses 80 percent of its energy 
opponents insist that alternative energy sources should be 
enough and cite safety and environmental objections to the nuclear 
option they contend that a country burdened with a 40 billion 
foreign debt cant realistically spend an additional billion 
dollars or so on nuclear power 
three experimental nuclear reactors used for research already 
operate at bandung in west java jogjakarta in central java and at 
serpong 19 miles southwest of jakarta 
officials of the batan national atomic energy agency say 
serpong is the thirdlargest neutronproducing reactor in the world 
after grenoble in france and brookhaven on long island in new york 
subsidized by west germany and opened last august by president 
suharto the 30megawatt serpong reactor is for research on fuel 
elements and processing of radioactive waste and produces 
radioisotopes for food preservation 
in opening the plant suharto said it was important for 
indonesian scientists to learn nuclear technology 
when eventually our development effort requires the use of 
nuclear energy to generate electricity we will then have mastered 
the technology 
development of nuclear power now has the governments lowest 
energy priority behind hydroelectricity geothermal resources 
coal gas and oil gas and oil are regarded as mainly for export 
and earn about 70 percent of the countrys foreign exchange 
indonesia is the worlds largest exporter of liquified natural 
gas and east asias biggest oil exporter with a 12 
millionbarreladay quota from the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
proponents of nuclear power are led by bacharuddin jusuf 
habibie the cabinet minister in charge of research and technology 
he is best known for establishing aircraft manufacturing in 
indonesia and is regarded as close to suharto 
the multipurpose reactor at serpong is one of the facilities 
prepared to support eventual development of a nuclear generating 
station habibie told a seminar on atomic energy in june 
he said java will need an additional 27000 megawatts of 
electric power by the year 2015 and available sources of supply can 
provide only 20000 habibie also said that since it will take 
seven to 10 years to build a nuclear plant a decision should be 
made soon to head off a possible power shortage 
a world bank analysis said last year however that indonesia 
should delay until 1995 any decision on nuclear power 
for the short to medium term a nuclear power program cant be 
justified on economic grounds the analysis said it estimated 
that nuclear energy per kilowatthour costs at least five us 
cents compared to three cents for conventional energy 
the world bank report bolstered indonesian treasury officials 
who contend that the project is too ambitious and costly 
habibie and his opponents agree that indonesia cant afford to 
finance nuclear power through the usual commercial methods 
he proposes instead a buildoperatetransfer bot 
arrangement under this system a foreign contractor builds the 
plant operates it for 15 years and transfers it to the government 
after earning a reasonable return on selling electricity 
batan the atomic energy agency has selected a site for a 
900megawatt plant and is studying offers to build it from three 
foreign consortia framatome of france which is linked with 
kraftwerk union of west germany westinghouse the us company 
which has joined forces with mitsubishi of japan on the project 
and atomic energy of canada ltd which is cooperating with japans 
marubeni corp and hitachi co 
the proposed site is in central java 285 miles east of jakarta 
not far from a dormant volcano java has 28 active volcanos and 
environmentalists question the wisdom of building a nuclear plant 
near even a dormant one

naoko kamimura invested in the stock market 
recently for the first time after a broker told her the stock of a 
machinery company was almost guaranteed to rise 
the 24yearold airline stewardess took 680000 yen worth about 
5200 from a lowinterest savings account she bought 1000 
shares and in less than a month the share price soared by nearly 
40 percent 
the salesman convinced me that the rise of the share price was 
promised because he had reliable insider information about the 
company which is not available to the public she said 
ms kamimuras profit is an example of japans traditional 
acceptance of insider trading which in other financial centers is 
considered an unfair strategy for profiting in stocks through the 
use of confidential information 
but japan is under intensifying pressure to abandon some 
traditional practices and adopt standards accepted in new york and 
london as the tokyo exchange has grown into the worlds largest 
stock market 
foreign and some domestic investors are urging the government to 
take tougher measures against dubious practices warning that the 
tokyo market will lose credibility with foreign investors whose 
presence in tokyo is rapidly growing 
as a result of these pressures and recent scandals the 
government is tightening a weak law on insider trading and 
expanding restrictions on securities firms and banks 
among the scandals 
last september hyogo sogo bank of osaka was suspected of 
insider trading when it hastily sold large holdings of tateho 
chemical shares prior to the announcement that tateho had lost 
several million dollars speculating on bond futures 
later it was learned that tateho had revealed the loss to hyogo 
sogo bank its creditor before the public announcement 
in july the political and business worlds were shocked when 
aides to top leaders including prime minister noboru takeshita and 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa were found to have earned up to 
800000 by trading unlisted shares of a real estate company 
recruit cosmos co 
also in july massive insider trading was suspected when the 
share price of sankyo seiki manufacturing co jumped hours before 
it was announced that nippon steel co the worlds largest 
steelmaker had acquired a stake in sankyo 
both the finance ministry and the tokyo stock exchange are 
investigating the case and it has been revealed that a large 
number of employees of both companies bought sankyo shares before 
the deal was made public 
shortly after the tateho case broke the finance ministry 
decided to revise the securities and exchange law and significantly 
enlarge the ministrys investigatory and surveillance functions on 
stock dealings 
the diet the japanese parliament passed the revised law in may 
and it will be implemented by october for the first time criminal 
punishment was introduced for insider trading that provision is to 
take effect next april 
david ruder chairman of the us securities and exchange 
commission said while visiting tokyo in february that the bill 
covered 98 percent of what we cover in the united states of 
illegal trading 
keisuke matsuura a private investment consultant who has 
followed the japanese stock market for more than 30 years said the 
disclosure of the recruit cosmos case with its links to top 
political aides was itself a sign of change 
five years ago behindthedoor dealings like these were 
routinely practiced but they were never revealed matsuura said 
meanwhile the securities industry is taking steps against 
insider trading 
nomura securities co the largest securities house in japan and 
one of the largest in the world recently announced that it is 
separating corporate and investment sections and will block the 
flow of information between the two a barrier known in the 
investment trade as the chinese wall its intended to block a 
major potential source of inside information 
earlier this month the tokyo stock exchange requested member 
companies to streamline the disclosure process and asked for the 
prompt release of corporate information which may affect share 
prices 
despite such favorable signs many market participants believe 
the dominance of traditions and customs wont change easily by 
simply establishing new rules and restrictive measures 
the mentality of the investors and stockbrokers has to be 
changed drastically if insider trading is to be stopped said 
matsuura who is also familiar with overseas stock markets 
keiichi nishida at kidder peabody amp cos tokyo office 
commented all those changes we hear lately seem to be just 
bluffs 
nishida who worked for japans daiwa securities co until 
recently believes it will require what he called a near miracle to 
change the fundamental nature of the japanese stock market 
interviews with brokers and officials at securities firms who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity showed how hard it will be to 
change the tradition of insider trading 
i cant recommend my clients what to buy if i have no insider 
information at all and my clients wont buy shares if i cant give 
them useful information said a broker at one of the top four 
securities firms in japan

international business machines corp is 
preparing to drop a dealer incentive plan that misfired by driving 
down the street price of the personal system2 
the program began jan 1 and was supposed to last for a year 
but will be dropped after sept 30 because of complaints by some 
dealers said roger savitt an ibm spokesman 
some dealers took the credits and bonuses that they received for 
achieving sales targets and applied the money to lowering their 
prices that disturbed other dealers who said the plan was eroding 
their profit margins 
in order to mollify dealers who like the plan incentives will 
be made richer until the program ends savitt said ibm has not 
decided what to replace the program with 
on another matter ibm spokesman james monahan said last week 
the company has no intention of reintroducing the pc at which it 
phased out after introducing the personal system2 line in april 
1987 
confusion may have arisen because ibm is planning to introduce a 
computer that uses the same microprocessor as the at intel corps 
80286 and does not run the new operating system2 currently the 
only members of the personal system2 family that dont use the new 
operating system have less powerful microprocessors 
ibm has not specified when such a computer might be released 
but has said since february that introducing one was part of its 
strategy

stock prices closed lower in the slowest trading 
day of the year with investors concerned that british interest 
rates may be raised again 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index closed 12 
points or 07 percent lower at 18323 
volume was a scant 2315 million shares the lowest recorded in

the market remained depressed throughout the trading session by 
fears of another increase in the british commercial banks base 
lending rate which was raised to 11 percent from 105 percent two 
weeks ago 
the government has raised interest rates several times this year 
to choke off potentially inflationary growth in the british economy 
we certainly wouldnt rule out another rise in the short 
term said kevin gardiner an economist at warburg securities 
but the government might wait for more economic data to be 
released and assessed before acting he added 
investors are awaiting thursdays release of british trade

matter well provide details later 
the contest was dubbed the first american texas national bank 
contest and survey 
many bank names are combinations of first national american 
texas and of course bank the contest is a challenge because many 
texas institutions use arrangements of those and other words

demand for us grain and soybean products 
wheat futures also closed sharply lower 
rain was moving east into the central corn belt where a 
summerlong drought has inflicted severe damage on the corn and 
soybean crops but analysts said the rain was coming too late to 
greatly benefit the crops corn plants passed their most vulnerable 
period in midjuly and most of the soybean crop is past the 
critical podsetting stage 
the rain was the catalyst for the selloff said victor 
lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
but the thing behind it all is that demand is still not very 
good he said we need an increase in demand to get this market 
moving and were just not getting it 
mickey luth a soybean analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc 
in chicago agreed the markets waiting for the demand to 
develop and with no players it moves lower he said 
corn and oat futures were limited to daily moves of 10 cents a 
bushel the wheat limit was 15 cents and soybeans were limited to 
moves of 30 cents a bushel except for the expiring august soybean 
contract which had no limit

the federal deposit insurance corp will try a new 
approach a public auction to sell more than 75 million in 
shaky loans it acquired in its 1984 bailout of the continental 
illinois national bank amp trust co officials said monday 
parties ranging from other financial institutions to collection 
agencies and vulture funds are likely to join in the bidding on 
oct 20 according joel d zegart president of jbs amp associates 
inc which will conduct the openoutcry auction in a ballroom at a 
downtown hotel 
the loans which include commercial real estate energy and 
personal loans are among 52 billion in continental bank loans 
the fdic purchased for 35 billion as part of its 45 billion 
plan to save the bank from failure 
continental acting as the fdics administrator has collected 
on or disposed of problem loans with a face value of more than 37 
billion since the federal rescue said jerry lemmons a member of 
the bank team in charge of the effort 
the fdic will assume sole responsiblity for disposing of any 
loans that are not sold or collected on by nov 1 lemmons said 
chicagobased jbs pioneered the auction approach to loan sales 
holding the first such event last october when it generated about 
27 million from the sale of 8 million worth of loans made by two 
failed central illinois banks zegart said 
the fdic and continental opted for the publicauction route 
after a failed offering of 12 billion worth of the problem loans 
none of the sealed bids received for that package met the minimum 
price set by the agency 
the biggest advantage is that the public auction provides a 
sense of confirmation for buyers zegart said it provides an 
opportunity for them to be in an open forum and see how their peer 
group values certain assets 
prices paid at similar though smaller jbs loan auctions ranged 
from a penny per dollar of face value for the most hopelessly 
uncollectable loans to 95 cents on the dollar he said 
the worstcase loans called chargeoff loans because they 
are regarded by the seller as not worth the cost of collecting 
typically are purchased for pennies on the dollar by collection 
agencies and investment pools called vulture funds the 
officials said 
loans with a better chance of being repaid may be bought by 
thrifts savings and loans or sophisticated investment groups that 
are prepared to work out payment schedules or take the debtor to 
court zegart said 
lemmons said the package of continental bank loans being readied 
for auction would be heavily skewed toward chargeoff loans

the stock market finished broadly lower today 
as worries that interest rates may continue rising helped extend 
last weeks losses 
the decline occurred in relatively sluggish activity 
analysts said many investors stayed away from the stock market 
in advance of a flurry of economic reports due to be released later 
this week 
the government plans to report this week on consumer prices for 
july and secondquarter economic growth among other things 
the economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the 
federal reserve boosted its discount rate by a half percentage 
point to 65 percent earlier this month in a bid to head off 
inflation 
some stock market analysts feel further rate increases may be 
forthcoming a development that would make treasury issues more 
attractive to big institutional investors at the expense of the 
uncertain returns on stocks 
today yields on the closelywatched 30year treasury bond edged 
past the 940 percent mark after finishing below that level last 
week 
analysts said traders were worried that tuesdays scheduled 
report on consumer prices would show a big jump that would 
encourage the federal reserve to tighten credit conditions further

a management groups offer to take 
wickes cos inc private in a 598 million leveraged buyout has 
brought numerous inquiries from other potential buyers the 
companys investment banker said monday 
the 12ashare tender offer made late sunday by a management 
group led by wickes chairman sanford sigoloff included a 60day 
wait before the group would begin buying wickes stock to give other 
bidders a chance to emerge 
numerous potential buyers called monday said michael 
tennenbaum senior managing director at bear stearns amp co inc 
which was retained to advise wickes management on the offer 
tennenbaum wouldnt reveal names but said some callers were 
interested in buying the company intact and others sought 
information on some of its parts 
our phones have been ringing off the hook tennenbaum said 
people who have a prima facie financial capacity to do this 
transaction are calling in impressive numbers 
wickes stock closed at 1325 a share monday on the new york 
stock exchange up 387 a share from fridays close 
a buyer of wickes would have to assume 21 billion in debt the 
companys main lines of business are industrial products including 
auto fabrics and aircraft and missile parts home improvement and 
furnishings including wickes furniture and builders emporium 
doityourself stores in southern california and a group that 
makes wallpaper and carpet 
sigoloff who led wickes out of bankruptcy proceedings 3 years 
ago said the management group financed by drexel burnham lambert 
inc wouldnt begin buying shares until oct 20 and didnt make it 
a condition of the deal that the company refuse other bids 
while we believe that our offer is fair both management and 
the board want to ensure that the companys shareholders obtain the 
best price for their shares sigoloff said in a news release 
announcing the leveraged buyout offer 
the 60day delay in purchasing shares was intended to ensure 
that ample opportunity is afforded to determine whether it is 
possible to achieve a higher price for our stockholders he said 
sigoloff refused an interview request monday and a company 
spokesman declined to expand on sundays statement 
the group is offering 12 a share for up to 83 percent of 
wickes 498 million outstanding shares if the buyout is 
consummated each share that isnt purchased would be exchanged for 
a share of a new class of preferred stock valued at 12 a share 
the offer is contingent on 50 percent of outstanding shares 
being offered for sale and on obtaining financing the company 
said 
in announcing the buyout offer wickes said it lost 124 
million in the second quarter in contrast to its profit of 189 
million in the second quarter of 1987 secondquarter sales were 
9379 million up from 865 million a year earlier 
sigoloff and others in management run little risk in making the 
offer said leslie w childress an analyst who follows the company 
for harper mclean amp co in seattle 
they win either way childress said they either are 
successful and get it at 12 a share or somebody comes in and 
offers a bit more and they win anyway 
some analysts suggested the heavy debt burden made it unlikely 
the price would rise much beyond the 12 offer others suggested 
potential buyers might be interested in various of wickes diverse 
businesses rather than in running the company as presently 
organized 
what you have in wickes are leadership niches in three major 
markets said gerald s may of painewebber in new york he valued 
the company at 12 to 15 a share 
sigoloff brought the company out of bankruptcy in january 1985 
to embark on a buying spree that included the acquisition of 
consumer and industrial products lines from gulf and western corp 
home improvement businesses from wr grace amp co and collins 
aikman corp a new york manufacturer of auto interiors fabrics 
and wallpaper 
wickes made unsuccessful bids for national gypsum of dallas 
owenscorning fiberglass corp of toledo ohio and lear siegler 
inc a southern california aerospace and auto equipment 
manufacturer

futures market said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter 
reynolds inc

bushel the wheat limit was 15 cents and the soybeans were limited

supervision of the merger with gulf corp following chevrons 133

in terms of its energy supplies he said oil imports are up 
to 40 percent of total us consumption today theyll be over 50 
percent in the next couple of years and who knows from there 
i think its important that the country adopts policies that

interestrate worries drove the stock market 
broadly lower on monday pushing the closing dow jones industrial 
average below 2000 for the first time in nearly three months 
this is very nervous trading said jack baker head of block 
trading at shearson lehman hutton inc this isnt the kind of 
market thats going to bring people off the sidelines 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which lost 2152 points 
last week gave up another 2578 to close at 199022 
that was the lowest closing level for the markets bestknown 
indicator since it finished at 195644 on may 27 the day before 
the threeday memorial day holiday when traders returned may 31 
the dow climbed 7468 points and the industrial average finished 
above 2000 every day since then 
declining issues outpaced gainers by a margin of nearly 3 to 1 
among issues listed on the new york stock exchange with 385 up 
1107 down and 466 unchanged the nyse index fell 160 to 14594 
the pace of trading was sluggish however volume on the floor 
of the nyse amounted to 12225 million shares down from 12237 
million shares on friday nationwide consolidated volume in 
nyselisted issues including trading at regional exchanges and on 
the overthecounter market totaled 14490 million shares 
as the market opened stock prices pushed marginally higher but 
quickly reversed course when a decline in bond prices drove 
fixedincome yields higher 
analysts said the yields available in the bond and money markets 
are keeping many investors out of the stock market that 
inclination was even more pronounced on the eve of the first of a 
flurry of economic reports due to be released this week analysts 
said 
the government plans to report tuesday on consumer prices for 
july later in the week it planned to revise its estimate of 
secondquarter economic growth among other things 
the economy has been growing at such a strong pace that the 
federal reserve boosted its rate on loans to member banks by a half 
percentage point to 65 percent earlier this month in a bid to head 
off inflation 
shearsons baker said traders were worried that tuesdays 
consumer price report would show a big jump that would encourage 
the central bank to push rates even higher that would make 
treasury issues even more attractive to big institutional investors 
compared with the uncertain returns on stocks 
on monday prices of the widelyfollowed 30year treasury bond 
fell 5 for every 1000 in face value pushing its yield to 945 
percent from 939 percent on friday 
alfred e goldman director of technical market analysis for the 
brokerage ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis said yields on 
shorter term issues are also attractive he noted that 5year 
treasury issues are yielding about 9 percent for instance while 
the dow jones industrials have lost more than 160 points since 
early july 
as long as stocks are going down these will provide some very 
stiff competition for the investors dollar the institutional 
investor who has substantial cash reserves is saying why bother

the department of housing and urban 
development said monday the demands of a homeless assistance group 
to stop the sales of foreclosed singlefamily dwellings would 
bankrupt a federal housing administration mortgage insurance fund 
the fund sustained by the collection of mortgage insurance 
premiums from homebuyers who use fha mortgage insurance has helped 
millions of firsttime low and moderateincome homebuyers since 
its creation in the 1930s hud said 
if we suspended sales the fha fund would be out of operation 
by the end of 1990 said j michael dorsey hud general counsel 
earlier this month hud called off a national sales campaign 
which the department hoped would unload 15000 foreclosed 
singlefamily properties and it canceled an auction of 158 
foreclosed washington dcarea homes last weekend 
the action was taken because of the threat of a lawsuit by the 
national housing law project which claims hud is violating a 
homelessassistance law passed last year that requires government 
agencies to consider the needs of the homeless before selling 
foreclosed properties 
dorsey said hud does not consider the foreclosed singlefamily 
dwellings it is selling to be surplus property the department 
considers the homes to be inventory he said 
additionally he said hud makes available all of its foreclosed 
singlefamily homes to homeless providers at a discount of 10 
percent below fair market value before the homes are listed for 
sale to the public 
the agency also offers homeless providers leasepurchase 
agreements for the hudowned homes at a cost as low as 1 per year 
he said the provider is responsible for maintaining the property 
and paying the property taxes during the lease period 
since 1985 the agency has transferred about 200 singlefamily 
homes to homeless providers about half by sale and half by lease 
he said 
dorsey said the department is reviewing its process of making 
singlefamily homes available to homeless providers and hud 
officials plan to meet with representatives of the berkley 
califbased national housing law project soon to discuss possible 
changes 
the national housing law project however is not satisfied the 
group which assists lawyers helping indigent clients with housing 
cases is threatening again to challenge the housing sale in court 
florence roisman a staff attorney for the project said the 
group planned to file suit in michigan on tuesday to challenge a 
scheduled sale there

a group of miners monday filed a 1 
billion federal lawsuit against the united mine workers of america 
and its leadership claiming the union prevented it from recovering 
wages lost during a 3year strike 
the lawsuit contended the union did not represent the miners 
properly and discriminated against them because they did not take 
part in selective picketing 
named in the suit filed in us district court included rich 
trumka umw president cecil roberts vice president and john 
banovick secretarytreasurer each was accused of conspiring to 
keep the 406 plaintiffs from collecting benefits to which they 
should have been entitled 
jerry hammond a spokesman for the socalled forgotten 400 
said the lawsuit stemmed from an agreement reached in may between 
the umw and the at massey coal co and its subsidiaries to end 
selective strikes launched against two eastern kentucky mines in 
1984 
the agreement requiring payment of 447 million to the union 
also settled a lawsuit challenging masseys decision to turn the 
mines into nonunion operations 
about 700 miners including hammond worked at the two mines 
until february 1983 when all but a maintenance crew were laid off 
the remaining miners workers lost their jobs sept 30 1984 the 
day before the two mines were sold to sidney coal co a subsidiary 
of ora mae coal co an operation owned by massey 
after the agreement was announced roberts said the 447 
million for lost wages and benefits would be divided among about 
250 miners who had been on selective strikes with each receiving 
about 18000 
hammond of red jacket wva said the lawsuit contends that 
the umw breached its duty of fair representation by limiting the 
number of members who would receive payments 
hammond and other plaintiffs also contend they have been 
excluded from union meetings thus violating the organizations 
constitution 
the lawsuit asks for a jury trial plus 500 million in 
compensatory and 500 million in punitive damages 
in washington union spokesman joseph corcoran said late monday 
that the unions legal department had not yet seen the lawsuit but 
corcoran said the union is very confident that that settlement 
will be upheld in any court 
trumka pushed for the unions use of selective strikes and on 
oct 1 1984 massey became the first target after the company 
refused to sign the unions national coal wage contract signing 
would have given masseys laidoff employees companywide 
reemployment rights 
the union finally called off the sometimes violent strike in 
december 1985 when massey agreed to settlement of an unfair labor 
practice charge but selective strikes against the two subsidiaries 
continued until may

venezuelan president jaime lusinchi 
leveled harsh criticism at foreign commercial banks monday 
blasting them for what he called their speculative treatment of 
latin american debtors 
either we are loyal to our peoples and we look after their 
wellbeing or we yield with those who impose conditions on us and 
violate our rights and who only feel egoism opulence and 
insatiable avarice lusinchi told conference delegates from 23 
spanish and portuguesespeaking nations of america and europe 
the speculative criteria that predominates in big financial 
centers is incompatible with the interest of all people on earth 
lusinchi said 
the president spoke during the opening ceremony of the sixth 
iberoamerican conference held to organize the planned 1992 
celebrations of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of america 
lusinchis remarks come as venezuela is seeking about 25 
billion in new loans from foreign financial institutions to help 
cover a balance of payments deficit 
commercial banks widely are expected to seek economic austerity 
measures as a condition for new lending to venezuela 
lusinchi labeled as absurd latin americas current economic 
situation in which countries from mexico to argentina are 
struggling to pay foreign debts of over 400 billion venezuela 
which has a 34 billion foreign debt is the regions 
fourthlargest debtor 
this is a threat to our most elemental rights against our 
democratic stability and against our societies that want 
wellbeing and freedom he said 
lusinchi earlier this month sent a financial mission to the 
united states and europe to seek new debt financing 
venezuelan officials claim commercial bank creditors have 
reneged on a promise included in a 1987 partial debt refinancing to 
provide venezuela with new funds and help it regain access to 
international financial markets 
but despite recent rumors that venezuela might declare a 
unilateral debt payment moratorium lusinchi and other top 
administration officials have said any suspension of payments would 
occur only if the financial mission failed and only in concert with 
commercial banks
