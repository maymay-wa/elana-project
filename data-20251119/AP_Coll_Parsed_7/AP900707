grouping students based on past 
performance keeps underachievers down and lumps minorities into 
classes that can prevent them from realizing their potential the 
nations largest teachers union says 
socalled academic tracking should be abolished a national 
education association report issued today said 
academic tracking has become a hot educational issue as us 
students continue to test poorly in basic subjects the report was 
issued in conjunction with the annual convention of the union 
representing 2 million educators 
opponents complain that minorities are too often placed into low 
ability and special education classes proponents argue tracking is 
needed so high achievers can move rapidly 
nea vice president robert chase said it would be foolhardy and 
unrealistic to expect that tracking can be eliminated overnight 
but he said the union will offer strategies to better arrange class 
groupings 
the report based on a commissioned johns hopkins university 
study said students can benefit from tracking but only under very 
specific conditions 
students should be grouped only for specific skills like 
reading rather than by general ability it said also group 
assignments should be frequently reassessed 
the report said most schools track students by segregating them 
all or most of the day based on general achievement or behavior 
rather than by abilities in specific subjects 
the study found that groupings in elementary and secondary 
schools are hard to break out of and are likely to create racially 
identifiable classes 
also the study said minorities are significantly 
underrepresented in socalled gatekeeper classes prerequisites 
to higher level courses 
without these courses the study noted many students are 
prevented from pursuing careers in advanced fields like science and 
engineering 
two years ago the union adopted a resolution calling for an end 
to academic tracking based on socioeconomic status race or 
sex todays report came from a task force appointed then to 
study the issue further

emergency measures that include banning 40 percent of all cars 
trucks and buses from downtown hospitals have reported a sharp 
increase in cases of respiratory disease

president bush is sharing credit with mikhail s 
gorbachev for natos decision to tone down its warfighting 
doctrine saying the embattled soviet leader is entitled to declare 
ive been right in dealing with the west 
bush said gorbachev can boast that the 16nation nato alliance 
agreed to overhaul its strategy in direct response to 
sovietsanctioned democratic changes in eastern europe 
at the same time bush observed it was the united states 
draft that shaped the new direction for nato 
gorbachev should get on the offensive against soviet critics 
who are angry over the collapse of the warsaw pact and the pullback 
of red army troops bush suggested friday at the conclusion of 
natos twoday summit 
bush was in high spirits as he flew here for two days of 
diplomatic meetings and texasstyle celebrations before opening the 
annual economic summit of the seven largest industrial powers 
monday 
the president jetted to houston on a 10hour nonstop flight from 
london and the nato meeting which swiftly agreed to his blueprint 
for changes in western military doctrine to reflect the reduced 
military threat from moscow 
relaxing against the side of a seat on air force one bush could 
barely conceal his delight you saw what happened to us 
influence today he said pointing to the nato communique which 
incorporated his proposals 
despite his upbeat mood bush refused anew to declare the cold 
war over 
ive tried to avoid code words he said at a postsummit 
news conference the cold war being over is something that id 
rather not comment on 
i dont think were dealing in terms of victory and defeat 
he continued were dealing in terms of how do we stabilize and 
guarantee the peace and security of europe 
acting on bushs suggestions nato agreed to shrink its arsenal 
of battlefield nuclear weapons in tandem with soviet action and 
relegate them to highly unlikely lastresort use 
the nato leaders also said that once negotiations begin on 
shortrange nuclear forces the alliance will propose in return 
for reciprocal action by the soviet union the elimination of all 
its nuclear artillery shells from europe 
they also decided to field smaller and restructured ground 
forces in the newest sign that natos 40year job of containing 
potential sovietbloc aggression was nearing a successful end 
at his news conference bush said that gorbachev could point to 
the nato meeting and say they have now changed their doctrine 
because of steps that i mr gorbachev have taken 
if i were him bush said id say ive been right 
the president said he would discuss the nato meeting with 
gorbachev in a telephone call over the next couple weeks aboard 
his plane the president said he recently received a communication 
from gorbachev but bush merely winked and smiled when asked to 
elaborate 
despite prodding from some allies bush said he was not ready to 
join west germany and perhaps others in rushing financial aid to 
moscow to prop up gorbachev and his sickly economy financial 
assistance for the soviet union is expected to be a major topic of 
discussion at the economic summit 
i have some big problems with that one and i think the 
american people do bush said 
if the germans decide they want to do that thats their 
business he said but i have made very clear to those who have 
spoken to me about this that at this juncture we have some serious 
problems and ive not been under any false colors about that at 
all 
he said for example the soviet union is spending too much 
money on its military bush also complained that moscow is paying a 
5 billion subsidy to cuba each year to sustain a totalitarian 
regime that is highly critical of the soviet union from time to 
time 
while objecting to direct financial aid bush said perhaps 
there are ways we can assist them as we go forward with credit or 
other matters before we go to direct government loans

bearing the offer of a nonaggression pact and a 
pledge to cut german forces nato secretary general manfred woerner 
is heading for moscow on the alliances most hopeful mission yet 
for allaying soviet fears about german unification and decades of 
eastwest enmity 
a day after woerner arrives in the soviet capital on july 14 
west german chancellor helmut kohl will also meet with president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the visits reflect a steppedup drive by the western allies to 
develop new ties and pacts with the soviet union following natos 
dramatic revamping of its longstanding military strategy at a 
summit which ended friday in london 
the london declaration transforms our relationship with old 
adversaries declared president bush who drafted the new 
doctrine to those governments who confronted us in the cold war 
our alliance extends the hand of friendship 
in a communique the 16 nato leaders pledged to reduce sharply 
both nuclear and conventional defenses in europe and said they held 
no aggressive intentions toward the soviet union they promised 
they will never in any circumstance be the first to use force 
in moscow gorbachev said he was ready to accept an invitation 
from the london summit to address a nato meeting probably in 
december 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze welcomed the 
summits outcome saying the decisions move in the right 
direction and pave the way to a safe future for the entire european 
continent 
bush headed for houston aboard air force one when informed of 
shevardnadzes comments replied thats very interesting and 
very positive 
but it remained unclear whether the alliances solemn pledges 
would be enough to persuade gorbachev to drop his objections to a 
united germany being a member of nato 
i would like to see the tangible response be an acceptance of 
the concept that a unified germany in nato is not only good but 
that it certainly is no threat to them said bush 
kohl called the commitment to cut german troop levels an 
indispensable signpost along the path leading to german unity 
this is a wideranging offer said kohl of natos new 
stance this is nato offering a hand 
the nato leaders committed themselves to decide on a troop level 
for a unified germany by the autumn 
the new reduced level will then become part of the next round of 
negotiations with the soviets on lower overall troop levels for 
both nato and the warsaw pact 
bonns defense minister gerhard stoltenberg has agreed to cut 
more than 160000 from the current combined forces of west and east 
germany down to 400000 foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
has said an even greater cut to 350000 troops is acceptable 
at the summit the allies also agreed to the eventual 
elimination of all nuclear artillery shells in europe in return for 
reciprocal action from the soviet union and they decided to 
field smaller and restructured ground forces 
in a switch in strategy that upset france and had made britain 
uneasy the nato leaders relegated nuclear weapons to being weapons 
of last resort 
french president francois mitterrand objected saying nato 
should stick to its longtime doctrine that it might use nuclear 
weapons to repel an overwhelming soviet conventional attack 
british prime minister margaret thatcher came round to the 
concept after insisting that the communique stress nato retains the 
option of using nuclear weapons she also said last resort was 
sufficient now that the crumbling warsaw pact has lost the ability 
to mount a surprise attack 
at long last we have the chance to make for the first time in 
history military aggression in europe materially impossible and 
also politically meaningless declared woerner

the lights of damascus twinkled through the 
windows of a french nightclub british businessmen sipped danish 
beer poured by palestinian waiters a singer warbled her way 
through georgia on my mind 
the performer was polish of course 
poles may be struggling with economic troubles at home but in 
the middle east musicians from the eastern european nation are in 
high demand 
they seem to be everywhere playing scottish music at a burns 
night dinner in jordan hammering out rock favorites in dubai 
saloons playing chopin in syrian piano bars 
in a kuwait hotel steakhouse a polish band romped through a 
more or less american classic dee starrs at night are shining 
bright deep in dee harrt of taxes 
the singers accent was closer to warsaw than west texas but 
the fiddle player could toss a bow with the best in austin 
even the italian cruise ship achille lauro was carrying a 
complement of polish dancers when it was hijacked in 1985 
polish entertainers have acquired the sort of reputation for low 
cost and quality that polish industry is striving to win 
were good and were not too expensive said beata 
lewtak hired to sing with a jordanian band at an amman hotel 
robert lillis assistant general manager of ammans 
intercontinental hotel agreed 
its cheaper for us to hire poles than to hire other european 
or american musicians he said 
we know what were getting with the poles he said the 
standard of music and the range of music are excellent 
this victory on the musical free market is a legacy of polands 
crumbling socialist system ms lewtak and most other polish 
musicians are graduates of special music academies which give 
intensive training grounded in the classics 
many musicians began playing jazz and rock outside class often 
to the disapproval of their elders 
in the 50s jazz was forbidden in poland said tadeusz 
toczyski who played recently at the meridien hotel in damascus 
but now schools have begun to teach the new styles 
i like jazz best said tadeusz kasproak whose veto band 
played at ammans intercontinental but when im playing with an 
electronic automatic drummer its impossible 
many touring bands find themselves playing everything from light 
classical music to disco to regional songs 
this kind of job is the most difficult because you have to be 
good enough to play any kind of music they want said toczyski 
from krakow 
in poland you can find a lot of good musicians for many 
years the main reason that polish musicians went out was to make 
the money to buy electronic instruments toczyski said 
kasproak and his band rely heavily on costly foreign instruments 
such as keyboards and synthesizers he has traveled off and on for 
almost a decade 
nobody in poland can afford such equipment said kasproak 
who plays guitar trombone and piano 
kasproak his vocalist wife anna and keyboardist andryej 
niescior all from lublin played in finland hungary and 
yugoslavia before coming to jordan 
but many musicians said they were worried by hardships at home 
poland ended 40 years of communist party rule last year the 
solidarityled government has implemented market reforms that have 
fueled unemployment and inflation 
what has changed for us is only the prices ms lewtak said 
before i had a lot of money now i have nothing 
she also said working abroad brought its own hardships 
i have my husband my daughter at home all the time i think 
of them she said 
in time kasproak said maybe work will be good for us in 
poland

beneath a naked bluff on a milelong boston harbor 
island known chiefly for its antiquated jail lie the unmarked 
graves of about 4100 early immigrants whose american dreams ended 
in death 
most were famineweakened irish who fled their starving country 
in the mid1800s only to be deemed undesirable and detained on 
deer island where they died and until now were largely forgotten 
they symbolize all immigrants that have come to boston and to 
america mayor raymond flynn said this week they may have been 
poor probably didnt have any family and werent among the elite 
but still every respect should be afforded to their memory 
residents of boston home to more irishamericans per capita 
than any other us city are resurrecting the citys missing 
chapter 
deer islands lowsecurity jail is scheduled to close in 1991 
and local business labor and other groups plan to have the 
gravesite landscaped by 1995 the 150th anniversary year of the 
potato famine 
the mayor has announced plans to erect a celtic cross on the 
island and a statue near fanueil hall as part of the citys great 
hunger memorial project the nations first memorial to irish 
famine victims and victims of hunger around the world 
the graves on the island about four miles from bostons wharves 
came to flynns attention several months ago after construction 
workers turned up bones at a new sewage treatment plant site 
you think of them getting this far coming across the atlantic 
and being able to look over and see the city only to end up in 
an anonymous paupers grave said francis j costello the 
mayors adviser on irishamerican affairs we have to put a 
proper finish on this 
many of the thousands of immigrants held on deer island 
eventually made it to a new life on the mainland but thousands 
more were buried in shallow limelined trenches that held eight or 
10 bodies each 
their anonymous graves tell the story of immigrants who saw but 
never reached americas shores 
irelands population of 8 million was cut in half by fatal 
disease starvation and emigration after a devastating plant 
disease hit the countrys staple potato crop in 1845 
during the next 10 years more than 152000 irish fled to 
boston many of them tenant farmers forced to move on when they no 
longer could afford to pay rent 
the yankees were unprepared for the influx of penniless weak 
and diseased immigrants many of whom were near death after a month 
or more aboard the crowded coffin ships they had taken across 
the atlantic 
as a precautionary measure to ward off a pestilence that would 
have been ruinous to the public health and business of the city 
a quarantine hospital was established on deer island according to 
a massachusetts senate document dated 1848 
paupers and inmates also were held on the island because 
officials deemed them like the irish and a fraction of immigrants 
from other countries undesirable within the core urban area 
according to city documents 
it was really a human dump heap said dennis p ryan author 
of beyond the ballot a social history of the boston irish 
several roughhewn wooden crosses stood for years on the bluff 
near the graves but by about 1970 they had disappeared or 
disintegrated a lone white celtic cross also was erected amid the 
yellow rapeseed but that too is gone 
it wasnt a deep dark secret said deborah cox president of 
the public archaeology laboratory inc in pawtucket ri 
i think it was just one of those things people dont pay 
attention to and then eventually forget said cox whose company 
surveyed deer island before construction began on the new sewage 
treatment plant in late 1988 
bostons archivist edward quill has begun researching death 
records and handwritten weekly logs kept by physicians at deer 
islands quarantine hospital 
for years the records have gathered dust now theyll be 
available to genealogists and other researchers several flynns 
have turned up among the 872 names quill has traced 
it could well have been any immigrant group that has come to 
our country said mayor flynn thats why we need a symbol a 
decent resting place so their history wont be forgotten

the worlds three greatest tenors they each have 
a stradivarius in their throat says maestro zubin mehta have 
set aside egos to sing together for the first time 
jose carreras placido domingo and luciano pavarotti in 
alphabetical order please will sing tonight under the stars and 
amid the ruins of the baths of caracalla in a charity sendoff to 
the world cup soccer championship 
music and sport are the most universal things in the world 
domingo said at a news conference friday 
the concert is scheduled to follow the consolation match between 
the national squads of host team italy and england to determine 
third place in the monthlong competition the champion will be the 
winner of sundays game in rome between argentina and west germany 
if the italyengland game in bari goes into overtime the 
tenors will have to wait in the wings until the last kick both 
events will be broadcast live to hundreds of millions of television 
spectators around the world 
the three tenors who will be accompanied by two orchestras led 
by mehta made a big show of their camaraderie at the news 
conference at a rome hotel near the pantheon 
its a great challenge for each of us to sing near the other 
two carreras said i dont think its a competition on the 
contrary its an honor 
with photographers and camera crews stumbling over each other to 
capture the three together domingo extended a hand and the other 
two tenors and mehta each put a hand on top of the others the 
stout pavarotti wiped sweat off his forehead with a handkerchief 
poured a glass of mineral water for carreras sitting at his side 
and affectionately patted him on the head at one point 
after an opening orchestral rendition of giuseppe verdis i 
vespri siciliani the tenors will each get a turn appearing 
first in alphabetical order to avoid possible offense to egos then 
alternating the order each man has four solos with pavarotti 
getting the final turn with nessun dorma nobody sleep from 
giacomo puccinis turandot 
nessun dorma ends with a crescendo of vincero vincero 
vincero i shall win which pavarotti sang in a commercial for 
italian state televisions coverage of the world cup and in a 
concert in milan in late may to inaugurate the competition 
an avid soccer fan pavarottis home team italy failed last 
week to make the finals and my heart is bleeding he said 
for the concerts promoters the winning moment will be the 
shows last 20 minutes when the three tenors will sing together a 
medley of popular songs including o sole mio 
how do you think i feel leading the three tenors mehta 
asked its a dream 
with the tenors providing enough sonic booms organizers said 
air traffic officials at romes leonardo da vinci airport agreed to 
reroute flight paths so planes wont be flying over the 
1800yearold ruins of the public baths 
there are only 6000 seats amid the ruins where several operas 
are performed during the summer and about 100000 wouldbe 
concertgoers were left disappointed organizers said 
there was more pressure to get a ticket to the concert than to 
the final of the world cup on sunday evening rome mayor franco 
carraro said 
sales of tickets ranging from 25 to 335 yielded 1 
million organizers said 
the three tenors agreed to sing without pay and will donate to 
charity their share of revenues from television showings ticket 
sales as well as sales of videos cassettes and albums from the 
concert which will be recorded 
our pay is being together in this marvelous musical and 
human circumstance pavarotti said 
domingo born in spain but raised in mexico said four mexican 
villages devastated by an earthquake in 1985 will benefit from his 
share carreras who battled back from leukemia said hell donate 
his proceeds to foundations fighting the disease pavarottis share 
will help benefit sufferers of a variety of diseases as well as a 
marrow transplant center in pesaro italy 
pavarotti said the three agreed to do it in part because 
carreras back to the stage after his illness is so exceptional 
and because the soccer championship is such an important moment it 
wouldnt have been possible in any other moment

in his 11 months as prime minister kaifu 59 has sought to 
ease trade tensions with the united states japans main ally 
while at the same time improving tokyos relations with europe and 
exerting influence at a rate commensurate with japans economic 
power 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe waving charts he will 
show in houston said japan advanced from 9 percent of world 
economic output in 1980 to 14 percent last year while the us 
share crept from 23 percent to 24 percent 
japans responsibility worldwide is increasing said 
watanabe who was forced to admit last year that japan didnt have 
a policy on eastern europe because it was so remote from japanese 
concerns 
the collapse of communism brought a quick change in tokyo 
however and japan has pledged 195 billion in aid to poland and 
hungary 
what was remote decades ago can affect the world and japan 
has some responsibility to act in concert with other 
responsible nations watanabe said at a briefing for foreign 
journalists 
despite its new political interest in europe japan is conscious 
of being the only asian country at the summit it will voice some 
distinctly asian concerns at the meeting with leaders from the 
united states britain france west germany italy and canada 
we are very much interested in drawing the attention of the 
other summiteers to what is happening and not happening in this 
part of the world watanabe said he cited problems in china 
tibet mongolia cambodia and the korean peninsula 
kaifu is exected to argue at the summit for an end to the 
punitive ban on development loans to china and if his six 
colleagues dont agree japan may go ahead alone with its own plan 
for massive loans to beijing 
at last years summit in france chinas brutal suppression of a 
prodemocracy movement was a vivid memory the summit participants 
agreed on sanctions including a ban on highlevel contacts with 
chinese officials and a freeze on development loans 
japan has been chinas main source of credit and had planned 
52 billion in a fiveyear program of loans now kaifu and other 
japanese government officials say its time to open the credit 
window again to avoid isolating china or contributing to economic 
unrest there 
china has to know our moral reaction to last years violence 
but if they go into misery and confusion whos going to suffer 
watanabe said 
farm trade is expected to come up at the summit ahead of the 
december deadline for agreement on the socalled uruguay round of 
talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
washington has proposed a gradual phasingout of farm subsidies 
which are high not only in japan but also in europe and the united 
states 
japans official position is that it is willing to negotiate 
rice when its partners put their farm subsidies on the table 
kaifus cabinet decided friday on only a tiny decrease in the 
subsidy it pays rice producers signaling that japan is not 
changing its policy on agricultural trade for now 
japan bans rice imports to the dismay of rice farmers in the 
united states and thailand on grounds that it is the national 
staple food selfsufficiency in rice is a matter of national 
security the government says 
yet within japan the official position increasingly is coming 
under attack even from old guard figures in the governing liberal 
democratic party former prime minister noboru takeshita recently 
commended what he called the courage of the opposition clean 
government party in suggesting the import ban should be eased 
there had been suggestions to cut the subsidy by 4 percent or 
more but farmers with small operations are an important 
constituency of the governing conservative party and fridays 15 
percent cut was widely seen as a move to maintain their loyalty

the louisiana house on friday night 
voted to override gov buddy roemers veto of the nations 
strongest state abortion bill which contains no exceptions for 
rape or incest 
the vote was 7331 three more votes than were needed for a 
house veto override 
the state senate still had to deal with the veto roemer issued 
earlier in the day senators voted 2118 to adjourn late friday 
rather than vote on an override 
sen allen bares conceded on the floor that the bills backers 
didnt have the 26 votes needed to override the adjournment gave 
abortion opponents three days to lobby the senate by law the 
legislature must end its current session monday night 
if the senate also votes to override it would be the first 
override of a gubernatorial veto this century 
the measure would send doctors who perform abortions to jail for 
up to 10 years and fined them up to 100000 it was written for 
the purpose of challenging the 1973 supreme court decision that 
legalized abortion 
also friday antiabortion activists in michigan filed petitions 
with more than 330000 signatures to initiate a bill that would 
require girls to have a parents consent before obtaining an 
abortion 
roemer signed the veto friday morning according to his staff 
attorney john kennedy 
in his veto message roemer called the issue one of the most 
wrenching and divisive issues to be faced by this legislature 
he also responded to charges by backers of the bill that he has 
changed his position on abortion since he was a congressman 
running for governor in 1987 
as a member of congress i consistently voted to curb abortion 
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus roemer wrote in the 
veto message i initially voted for the exception to save the 
life of a mother but over the years of struggling with this issue 
i became acutely aware of the need to except those instances where 
conception occurred because of rape or incest 
women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences 
of these traumatic illegal acts 
roemer has repeatedly said he sides with antiabortion forces 
but cannot allow a bill without rape and incest exceptions to 
become law 
at an afternoon news conference the bills author state rep 
woody jenkins cited statistics showing that of more than 15000 
abortions performed in louisiana in 1987 only one was done to end 
a pregnancy that resulted from rape 
hes for killing 15000 unborn children a year in louisiana 
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also 
killed said jenkins 
robin rothrock leader of an abortion rights coalition said 
earlier she remained confident that the senate would sustain 
roemers veto 
in the senate we believe that we still have the 15 rothrock 
said referring to 15 senators who voted against the measure when 
it passed the senate with 24 votes an override requires a 
twothirds vote in each chamber 26 in the senate and 70 in the 
house 
the house passed the bill last week with 74 votes 
in michigan the legislature will have 40 days to pass the 
vetoproof measure once the petition signatures are validated 
failure of the measure would put the issue on the november 1992 
statewide ballot as a public referendum 
lawmakers passed a similar measure earlier this year but 
couldnt override democratic gov james blanchards veto 
a majority of house and senate members signed the petitions 
said michigan right to life president barbara listing 
the bill would require girls 17 and younger to have a parents 
consent for an abortion or to ask a judge for a waiver on the 
grounds that she is mature enough to make her own decision or the 
abortion would be in her best interest

pearson said moore and barry used an upstairs bedroom at her 
home three times before their romantic relationship ended in june

crack to accompany him down the stairs she said moore had begun 
to run up a tab for drugs and moore said the mayor was the one 
paying it off the witness added 
after the affair with barry ended moore said that she was 
going to get him pearson testified suggesting a possible motive 
for moores cooperation with the government moore testified that 
she was concerned for the mayors health came forward because she 
wanted to tell the truth and wasnt seeking revenge against barry 
after moore and the mayor broke up barry would telephone 
pearson to ask whether everything is all right and he would 
then tell her when he would stop by pearson testified 
his chaufferdriven limousine would pull up at her home and 
barry would come inside she said and i would give him the 
bags of crack and he would give me the money

critical tests to ferret out the mysterious 
hydrogen leak that has grounded americas space shuttle fleet are 
starting this weekend 
rockwell international the contractor that built the space 
shuttles will test pipes and valves from space shuttle columbia 
today and sunday at the company plant in downey calif 
engineers at the kennedy space center in florida meanwhile are 
preparing a leak test on atlantis a space shuttle on a launch pad 
william lenoir nasa associate administrator for space flight 
said friday the goal of the tests is to find where a leak developed 
in the maze of pipes and valves used to load liquid hydrogen aboard 
the shuttles 
leaks found in may on columbia and last week on atlantis caused 
the national aeronautics and space administration to ground all 
three of the nations winged spacecraft the third craft 
discovery is scheduled to fly in october if the leak problem is 
solved 
meanwhile friday an investigative board concluded two days of 
closeddoor hearings here on another major nasa problem the 
focusing flaw that disabled the 15 billion hubble space telescope 
nasa said the panel led by lew allen director of the space 
agencys jet propulsion laboratory was to determine how a 
manufacturer ground and polished the wrong prescription into one of 
two focusing mirrors on the telescope the mistake has caused the 
instrument to see the universe as a fuzzy blur 
the mirrors were manufactured by the hughes danbury optical co 
of danbury conn under a 440 million contract that included 11 
million in performance awards 
a report to be published monday in aviation week and space 
technology magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying nasa was 
offered air force facilities to test the telescope mirrors 10 years 
ago but the space agency turned down the offer 
but another trade publication space business news says in a 
story to be published monday that nasa was blocked from using 
defense department facilities to test the hubble mirrors because 
the same contractor also was making optics for air force spy 
satellites 
space business news quotes james beggs who was nasa 
administrator when the hubble was being built as saying that the 
air force wouldnt let us in to test the hubble mirrors or to 
even oversee their manufacture 
efforts to reach beggs by telephone for comment were 
unsuccessful 
lenoir told reporters there is still no estimate about how long 
the space shuttles will be grounded it all depends on how long it 
takes to find and fix the hydrogen leaks he said 
a leak discovered on atlantis during a test on the launch pad 
last week is similar to one discovered in may on columbia when that 
craft was being loaded with liquid hydrogen in preparation for 
launch 
columbia was rolled back to the hangar and engineers removed the 
elaborate plumbing fixture called the umbilical that is used to 
load hydrogen into the shuttle rocket propellant tank the fixture 
was sent to the rockwell plant in downey for testing 
on sunday rockwell engineers plan to pump helium then liquid 
nitrogen and finally the much colder liquid hydrogen through the 
umbilical 
if it does leak we should be able to pinpoint it lenoir 
said 
a more vigorous test is planned for atlantis next friday when 
liquid hydrogen is pumped into the spacecrafts tank at a high rate 
of flow plastic bags will be placed over the various valves pipes 
and seals that are suspected of leaking gas captured in the bags 
will be analyzed to determine the hydrogen content lenoir said 
if we get through all of that and we still cant find a leak 
then in all honesty we dont know where well go he said 
engineers earlier suspected that the leaks may have been caused 
by a slightly crooked installation of propellant tanks on both 
atlantis and columbia but lenoir said an analysis of the 
misalignment determined it could not be responsible for the leak 
at rockwell internationals assembly plant in palmdale calif 
meanwhile power surged friday for the first time into endeavour 
the newest member of americas space shuttle fleet 
a nasa announcement called the powerup a major milestone in 
testing of the new shuttles electrical system the spacecraft is 
scheduled to be completed in april 1991 and make its first flight 
in 1992

with cuts in us defense spending at issue 
democrats and republicans on the house armed services committee are 
drawing battle lines over how much of a military threat the soviet 
union continues to pose 
the 17 democrats on the committees special defense policy panel 
concluded in a report released friday that the soviet conventional 
threat to the united states and its western allies is greatly 
diminished and cannot be revived 
based on that assessment reductions in defense spending are in 
order they said 
old assumptions about the soviet threat dont jibe with 
reality anymore committee chairman les aspin dwis said 
many of the changes are irreversible and that means we can cut 
selectively without jeopardizing our security 
but the 15 republicans on the panel rejected that view as overly 
optimistic 
endorsing this report is tantamount to believing that the 
soviet union is already militarily impotent and not a global power 
to be reckoned with such a view is more wishful thinking than a 
reflection of reality said rep william dickinson of alabama 
ranking republican on the committee 
the gop members in a dissent included in the 310page report 
cited the absence of a ussoviet treaty to scale back 
conventional forces in europe the unclear future of a unified 
germany and the economic and political instability in eastern 
europe 
the report cited the testimony of cia director william webster 
who told the armed services committee on march 1 that the lessening 
soviet conventional threat would be increasingly difficult to 
reverse 
planned withdrawal of soviet troops from europe as announced by 
president mikhail s gorbachev in december 1988 will continue as 
long as the kremlin leader remains in power the report said 
even if gorbachev is replaced his successor would be forced to 
follow the same policies it said quoting a us intelligence 
assessment 
in short there has been too much change in the soviet union 
and eastern europe for the reduction in the threat to be 
reversed the report said 
the republicans said the houseapproved budget that calls for 
296 billion in defense spending for the 1991 fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 would carve too much out of the us military 
president bush has proposed spending 303 billion on defense in 
fiscal 1991 
we believe that the house defense spending figure which in 
percentage terms cuts defense spending three times more than the 
presidents budget does is imprudent the gop members said

office of thrift supervision said 
he said over the last several years over 20000 referrals 
concerning possible criminal activity involving 350 savings and 
loans have been sent to the justice department in the burgeoning 
scandal 
justice was getting all these criminal referrals but no 
prioritization fulwider said they didnt know which ones 
we thought they should really go after and concentrate on 
the expanded list was drawn up in late june at about the time 
president bush called for doubled spending on savings and loan 
fraud and proposed to create rapid response teams to combat the 
problem 
the administration has been under fire from democrats on capitol 
hill who say that it should have done more to jail savings and loan 
officials guilty of fraud and recover more of the estimated 
hundreds of billions of dollars lost 
the administration has been pointing to 791 fraud convictions 
last year as well as the recovery of 100 million in stolen funds 
and 530 active investigations this year 
attorney general dick thornburgh and timothy ryan director of 
the office of thrift supervision were expected to appear on 
tuesday before the senate judiciary committee for a hearing into 
savings and loan enforcement plans 
the initial list of 20 priority institutions was developed 
shortly after ryan took office in april and met with thornburgh 
it was produced by a group of enforcement officials from the 
federal deposit insurance corp the resolution trust corp the 
office of thrift supervision and the justice department 
authorities from the same agencies drew up the expanded list 
along with representatives from federal agencies from around the 
country officials said 
they said it would be improper to disclose the names of the 
institutions on the list some of them already have been seized by 
the government and some have not fulwider said 
officials said the list was presented several days ago to james 
g richmond the justice departments newly appointed special 
counsel for savings and loan fraud

word of a monthlong english course with no 
grades no required papers no interruptions and no tuition was 
sheer poetry for 10 promising writers who usually have more than 
verse and meter on their minds 
poets often cant find time to write because they must find ways 
to put food on the table said john wheatcroft director of 
bucknell universitys seminar for younger poets 
so bucknell invites the 10 best young writers it can find puts 
them up for a month each summer and lets them work 
the writers completed their fourweek course friday night with a 
meal they cooked at a farm along the susquehanna river and a poetry 
reading in bucknells 105yearold poetry center 
im very grateful for this ive never had a time in my life 
devoted exclusively to poetry said lisa sornberger who recently 
returned to school at eastern connecticut state university in 
willimantic conn before her return she was recreation director 
at a home for retarded adults 
theres never enough time so i squeeze writing in when i 
can she said i write mostly in the car while im driving 
ive tried to keep a tape recorder but it picks up too much road 
noise 
to keep the poets off the streets bucknell began inviting them 
to its campus six years ago 
usually 50 to nearly 100 apply for the program submitting two 
letters of recommendation a letter of selfintroduction and 15 
pages of poetry only 10 writers are selected 
were not trying to teach a body of information were not 
even trying to teach a skill wheatcroft said were giving 
them an opportunity to develop themselves as poets we provide them 
with the environment and ambience for that 
an anonymous evaluation from a participant in one of the first 
five programs likened the seminar to a religious retreat in that 
everything felt sacred except that the religion was poetry 
sornberger wrote seven new pieces this year but none is a 
completed poem she said amy hickman of anderson sc who goes 
to goucher college in baltimore finished three and revised several 
she had done before arriving at bucknell 
for her reading friday night hickman prepared charlie and 
ruby junes champale party in which the heroes party in the back 
of a pickup truck knocking back rum and slurpees 
sornberger read aunt stella a composite of a lot of women 
i love 
even with an unpromising financial future from poetry hickman 
and sornberger said they couldnt quit writing it without losing 
part of themselves 
for instance when im not writing much i get very tense 
very on edge hickman said writing poetry is like making order 
of the world its sort of being like people who are obsessively 
neat 
jobs and other classwork are the main culprits stealing time 
from wouldbe poets wheatcroft said 
usually princes subsidized poets and in some countries the 
state subsidizes them in this country most poets have had some 
other job wheatcroft said ts eliot was in banking and william 
carlos williams was a pediatrician for example 
in undergraduate work usually students must divide themselves 
over four courses split their heads four different ways he 
said we wanted to provide them with a month to see what they 
could do

the acquittal of imelda marcos dealt 
a setback to embattled president corazon aquino but looming 
political battles and talks on the future of us bases promise 
rougher days ahead 
problems have beset her administration from all sides 
during the past six weeks communist rebels have killed two us 
serviceman and kidnapped a peace corps volunteer 
foreign business groups complain that poor infrastructure and 
government policies are driving away international investors 
annual inflation is running in double digits and the stock market 
is sluggish 
mrs aquinos formation of a new political movement has angered 
her supporters in congress 
now the acquittal of mrs marcos on federal racketeering 
charges by a new york jury monday has invigorated the dwindling 
ranks of supporters of her late husband ousted president ferdinand 
marcos 
surveys show filipinos are losing faith not only in mrs aquino 
confidence is also dropping in all institutions she proudly cited 
as evidence she restored democracy after a 1986 uprising toppled 
marcos authoritarian regime 
despite the problems amando doronila editor of the manila 
chronicle said he was impressed by mrs aquinos steely calm 
during an interview this week 
many filipinos are convinced that recent events have eroded mrs 
aquinos support in both this countrys congress and the united 
states 
congressional supporters are angry over mrs aquinos decision 
to organize a new political movement kabisig or arminarm to 
promote social programs 
critics see the movement as a bid by the cabinet to bypass the 
legislature in the distribution of patronage on thursday house 
speaker ramon mitra an aquino stalwart said the country did not 
need another poorly conceived program and blamed the 
governments failures on incompetent cabinet secretaries 
rightly or wrongly many filipinos believe the us connection 
has been frayed 
filipino nationalists rail constantly at american 
intervention but washingtons blessing real or perceived is 
seen as a strong political card and government opponents take 
heart when they believe that support is waning 
many filipinos are convinced that us backing is ebbing even 
though us jets helped put down a december coup that nearly 
toppled the government 
that view is based on several events that us officials insist 
are coincidental 
they include an offer by the us military to fly dependents 
home after communist rebels killed two airmen near clark air base 
on may 13 there were few takers but manila newspapers made banner 
headlines of the american evacuation 
last month the united states withdrew all 261 peace corps 
members because of fears communist rebels planned to kill or kidnap 
volunteers 
although one volunteer timothy swanson was reportedly 
kidnapped commentators and government officials say washington 
overreacted 
presidential spokesman tomas gomez said washington has an 
obligation to help correct the unfair image of instability it 
had created 
in addition the american chamber of commerce in the philippines 
recently complained of 57 antiforeign investor bills pending 
in congress it said the government appeared hostile to investment 
mrs marcos acquittal was seen as another sign that washington 
was no longer interested in accommodating mrs aquino 
ambassador nicholas platt has repeatedly stated support for mrs 
aquino however filipinos remember washington gave similar 
assurances to marcos before dumping him for mrs aquino 
all in barely a week we saw how the americans failed the 
popular expectations of the aquino government wrote columnist 
art borjal in the philippine star a proadministration daily 
the general feeling is that the americans are tightening the 
screws on the aquino administration 
such views will doubtless complicate talks on the future of the 
six us military bases by encouraging the philippines to take a 
hardline stand on compensation and other issues 
talks resume next month the lease on the bases expires in 
september 1991 
any new agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member senate as a sign of its mood the senate has agreed to 
consider a resolution barring us negotiator richard armitage 
because of antifilipino remarks during earlier talks

negotiations will resume next week on final 
details of an agreement expanding us access to military 
facilities in singapore the pentagon says 
the proposed deal would not give the united states its own 
military base in singapore but it would greatly expand us 
military activity in the southeast asian citystate lt cmdr 
edward h lundquist a pentagon spokesman said friday 
lundquist said no us planes or ships would be based there 
permanently but a small contingent of american military personnel 
probably fewer than 200 would be stationed at the singapore 
facilities to keep them ready for us use 
lundquist stressed that the proposed use of singapore military 
facilities would not be a substitute for the larger us forces at 
clark air base and subic bay naval base in the philippines a 
military bases agreement between the united states and the 
philippines expires next year and the administration is seeking to 
negotiate some form of continued use of those facilities 
if the singapore deal is concluded us f16 fighter planes 
based elsewhere in asia would be allowed to conduct occasional 
training missions in singapore and navy ships could use 
singapores strategically located port lundquist said

the administration is planning to enhance 
current seafood inspections with a voluntary program paid for by 
companies whose products could earn an official government seal 
the new program would use industry controls and government 
inspections to provide additional assurances to consumers that 
fish and fish products are safe wholesome and properly labeled 
officials said friday 
the program was proposed by the food and drug administration and 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
the fda has a seafood inspection program that requires 
examinations of processors shippers packers and repackers 
labelers warehouses and importers of fish and fish products that 
program would continue separately 
noaas national marine fisheries service runs a voluntary 
feeforservice seafood inspection program which uses a government 
inspection mark that program would continue to provide grading 
services but continuation of other parts of the program would 
depend on the extent to which companies switch to the new system 
officials said 
the new plan would be based on inspections at various critical 
points at which health risks such as spoilage and bacterial 
growth can be controlled the fda said companies would pay a fee 
for inspections and could earn an official mark or seal they could 
display on their products label

president mikhail s gorbachev is hoping the 
industrial powers will open their pocketbooks to moscow but there 
were indications a quick aid fix may not be in the cards 
the issue of western aid to bolster soviet reforms will be 
discussed at the meeting of seven industrial nations beginning 
monday in houston 
it was also a topic at a twoday meeting of the north atlantic 
treaty organization in london but no decisions were made on the 
matter 
president bush said at the close of the nato meeting that he had 
big problems with a germanfrench soviet aid plan that could 
total billions of dollars 
bush cited concerns including the american peoples objections 
to soviet assistance to cuba 
nato sources said gorbachev in a letter to british prime 
minister margaret thatcher appealing for aid said he hoped for 
positive conclusions at the london and houston summits 
the letter did not mention any particular aid figure the 
sources said 
gorbachev has already had some success in attracting western 
help 
west germany has granted an unconditional loan of 31 billion 
and european leaders agreed at a dublin summit in late june to 
grant significant sums to the soviet union 
we view this step as an illustration of the desire to support 
reform policies started by president mikhail gorbachev west 
german economics minister helmut haussmann said last week 
some have suggested that west germanys motives are not entirely 
altruistic however 
the communist party daily pravda said in a recent commentary 
that bonn was trying to grease moscow into agreeing to allow a 
united germany to belong to nato something the western allies want 
this act by the west german government must be explained above 
all by efforts of the west german government to buy from the ussr 
the desired position on the issue of unification of the two 
germanys said kommersant a soviet economic weekly of the 
cooperative movement that seeks to foster independent businesses 
whatever the motives of the donors there is little doubt that 
the soviet union could use some western cash 
moscows balanceofpayment deficit now tops 2 billion with 
nearly half that sum owed to west german companies and creditors 
soviet citizens are also unhappy about the short supply of consumer 
goods 
economists both at gosplan the central agency responsible for 
running the economy and at the reformist institute for world 
socialist economies have concluded outside aid is essential for the 
transition to a market economy 
but that transition carries the price of hardship on the 
population that means more discontent which puts even more 
pressure on gorbachev 
gorbachev has said the country must develop some kind of market 
economy 
but many delegates to the communist party congress under way in 
moscow oppose private property and individual ownership of 
factories two basic precepts of a freemarket economy 
in addition prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov has balked at 
freeing prices another key step toward a market economy 
soviet officials have not said exactly what they would do with 
any western money 
for now the question of how the soviet union is going to 
utilize the means it has received is open kommersant said 
then theres the problem of how much money it would really take 
to stabilize the soviet economy 
estimates range from 5 billion to 20 billion huge sums 
compared to what eastern european countries have gotten from the 
west to restructure their economies

to f scott fitzgerald they were 
breathlessly aristocratic clubs frequented by an impressive 
melange of brilliant adventurers and welldressed philanderers 
to sally frank princeton universitys menonly eating clubs are 
part of an oldboy network that discriminates against women 
fitzgerald venerated the tiger inn and the ivy and cottage clubs 
in the 1920 novel this side of paradise almost 60 years later 
ms frank sued the three organizations seeking membership in the 
ivy league schools menonly clubs 
after an 11year battle during which she was vilified by other 
students ms frank a 1980 princeton graduate prevailed last week 
when the new jersey supreme court ordered the clubs to open their 
doors to the opposite sex 
ms frank now a 31yearold law professor at the new york 
university law school said she fought for so long because she 
believed the battle had implications beyond the gothicstyle 
ivyshrouded campus 
you always have clubs that call themselves private across the 
nation where major business and political leaders are members and 
people take tax deductions for their members ms frank said 
we know that important business contacts are made in those 
places and public policy decisions are often made over the dinner 
table she said the case is part of the broader struggle to 
stop discrimination in those kinds of organizations 
the centuryold eating clubs which are near campus serve meals 
to more than 75 percent of princetons juniors and seniors they do 
not provide living quarters the clubs have competitive standards 
for admission and students pay membership fees 
the cachet of the clubs made a deep impression on princeton 
alumnus fitzgerald who described the ivy club as detached and 
breathlessly aristocratic in his romantic vision the university 
cottage club attracted brilliant adventurers and welldressed 
philanderers while the tiger inn preferred the 
broadshouldered and athletic type 
such distinctions did not sit well with ms frank who was 
raised in bayonne and said her sense of social justice grew out of 
the chicago eight trial and the kent state shootings at 12 she 
boycotted nonunion lettuce and at age 13 she worked for 
presidential candidate george mcgovern 
she said she had no inkling that her attempt to join menonly 
clubs in an institution that first accepted women in 1969 would 
spark such a ruckus 
i thought that they would be intelligent about it and that 
they would see it as an issue and argue or debate it ms frank 
said i expected some hot repartee 
instead a club member poured beer on her she was booed at 
alumni rallies and her face was painted with a mustache on 
frankbuster tshirts that said better dead than coed 
things have changed at princeton since the lawsuit was filed in 
1979 
the cottage club settled in 1986 and now accepts women the ivy 
club and the tiger inn the only two of the 13 eating clubs to 
cling to maleonly membership had voted earlier this year to admit 
women but two more rounds of voting were needed next year for the 
decision to become effective 
in court the tiger inn and ivy club had argued they were 
private associations and therefore exempt from state 
antidiscrimination laws but the supreme court said it was 
disingenuous for the clubs to pretend they could exist apart 
from the school the clubs the court said are places of public 
accommodation 
the tiger inn president has promised to take the case to the 
us supreme court 
princetons clubs are the first at an ivy league school to be 
ordered to admit women the massachusetts commission against 
discrimination ruled in march that it had no jurisdiction to decide 
the case of a woman seeking admission to the fly club one of 
harvards nine allmale social clubs yales most exclusive secret 
society skull amp bones of which george bush is a member recently 
voted to continue excluding women 
in a gauge of how far princeton has come the alumni council 
last month gave ms frank an award for her efforts in encouraging 
coeducation 
it felt really warm and nice she said what the award 
meant to me was that just because you are a dissenter it doesnt 
mean you are not loyal

the greek government has lost a lastminute court 
bid to block a sale by sothebys auctioneers of a collection of 
ancient greek marble statues and pottery 
the greek government had sought to prevent the cycladic marbles 
as the collection is known from being split up 
we are very disappointed victoria solomonidis cultural 
attache at the greek embassy in london said after fridays ruling 
by the high court in london 
the judge sir john mummery said if the greek government wants 
to keep the collection intact it can bid for the marbles and 
pottery itself at the auction in london on monday 
if the governments real interest is to prevent dispersal of 
the collection then it is within its power to do so by attending 
the auction and bidding for and purchasing the items he said 
sothebys sale catalog lists 180 auction lots of marble statues 
pottery drinking vessels vases and other items 
ms solomonidis declined to comment on the judges suggestion 
that the greek government buy the collection 
the greeks say the collection which dates between 2600 bc and 
2200 bc was looted from the uninhabited greek island of keros in 
the late 1950s or the 1960s british news reports called the 
collection as rare and valuable but no sum was mentioned in the 
court proceedings 
lawyers for the greek government on thursday obtained a high 
court injunction temporarily banning sothebys from moving any of 
the collection 
but mummery ruled friday against continuing the injunction a 
move that would have forced sothebys to cancel the sale 
the judge noted that the greek government had waited until the 
last possible moment to press its claim rather than seeking to 
establish ownership during the years since the sculptures were 
allegedly stolen 
the present owner is the 77yearold widow of professor hans 
erlenmeyer of switzerland she was approached by the greek 
government when the collection was first listed for auction on her 
behalf but she refused to withdraw it 
the sale is being held to raise cash for the erlenmeyer 
foundation which was established in 1981 in basel in switzerland 
it works for causes ranging from environmental protection and 
conservation of natural resources to safeguarding animal rights 
it was not the first time the greeks have contested ownership of 
ancient treasures britain has repeatedly refused greek government 
demands for the return of the priceless sculptures known as the 
elgin marbles which adorned the acropolis in athens 2500 years 
ago 
a british diplomat lord elgin removed them in the early 1800s 
the british government says the elgin marbles belong to the 
british museum in london which bought them from lord elgin in 1816 
britain maintains that elgin acquired the sculptures legally at 
a time when greece was ruled by ottoman turkey greece says he 
stole them

officials at the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant suspended handling of all nuclear materials because 
of lax security a us department of energy official said friday 
plutonium operations at the plant were halted in november while 
safety and management improvements were made at the plant the new 
ban applies to other rocky flats nuclear operations virtually all 
of which are classified 
the suspension went into effect thursday night following an 
annual inspection by members of the does albuquerque nm 
operations office according to rocky flats doe manager robert m 
nelson 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver is the nations only 
source of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
nelson said investigators discovered security at the plant could 
be breached investigators were sent in during the past few weeks 
to try to smuggle out pieces of metal such as plutonium and other 
securitysensitive materials he said 
nelson said the only line of defense that failed was a metal 
detector such as that used at airports and there were other lines 
of defense that caught the materials 
it wasnt like they could smuggle it off the plant site he 
said 
nelson said the deficiencies developed because workers were 
wearing steeltoed shoes required by federal regulations that kept 
setting off the metal detectors he said workers at the plant 
became frustrated at having to remove their shoes to pass through 
the detectors and security became lax 
he said there was no danger because of the security lapses and 
the problems have been corrected he said workers are now wearing 
fiberglasstoed shoes that dont trip the monitors 
maybe we overreacted when we shut down the plant he said 
they only made it through one line of defense but to me thats 
enough to stop everything 
nelson said other violations were found but none were 
showstoppers 
they included things like improper access to classified 
documents and improper handling of chemicals but he wouldnt be 
more specific

a political protest has not asked the government for taxexempt 
status ms whight said she was uncertain about any other details 
regarding any irs probe of snyder

striking students chanted victory 
victory and the premier appealed for calm after socialist 
president petar mladenov bowed to popular pressure and resigned 
mladenovs announcement friday night appeared to avert a general 
strike the students had planned for monday against the government 
led by excommunists 
the students and the political opposition had demanded 
mladenovs resignation after a videotape revealed he suggested 
tanks be used to stop antigovernment demonstrators in december 
mladenovs letter of resignation was read on television news 
friday night meeting a deadline set by the students in an 
ultimatum earlier in the day 
mladenov who was instrumental in ousting bulgarias longtime 
strongman todor zhivkov said he was resigning because he did not 
want to become the cause for an escalation of tensions in the 
country bta reported 
premier andrei lukanov appealed for order in the wake of the 
resignation so that parliament could hold its first session tuesday 
in a calm atmosphere 
the students had conducted a 26day sitin to push their demands 
for democratic change after the former communists won last months 
parliamentary elections the first free balloting in bulgaria in 58 
years 
they called for a general strike monday if mladenov had not 
resigned by then 
atanas kirchev a student leader said the students would 
probably declare an end to their strike bta reported it said 
students celebrated the resignation with victory chants 
students teachers and parents from across the country had 
joined in the student strike in sofia and the growing split in 
public opinion led to fears of violence similar to that which has 
rocked neighboring romania in recent months 
mladenov in a nationwide television address on wednesday 
implicitly admitted having called for the use of tanks during the 
december demonstrations earlier he had said a videotape in which 
he was heard to say let the tanks come was doctored but 
experts said it was authentic 
the videotape was broadcast on tv on an election program by the 
main opposition alliance the 16party union of democratic forces 
three days before the june 17 parliamentary runoff elections 
the film was made dec 14 when about 50000 angry demonstrators 
converged on parliament to demand that the communist party give up 
its monopoly on power the protesters later dispersed peacefully 
and tanks were not called in 
mladenov came to prominence in november when he and other 
reformminded party members ousted hardliner zhivkov after 34 
years 
mladenov who had served as foreign minister for 18 years 
replaced zhivkov as communist party leader and president he 
immediately began taking cautious steps toward reform and opened a 
dialogue with opposition groups that quickly organized 
in april the communists changed their name to the socialist 
party and won 211 of the 400 seats in parliament in the june 
elections the union of democratic forces won 144 seats 
mladenov was to have served until the parliament drew up a new 
democratic constitution in about 18 months 
most of the original demands of the students on strike since 
june 11 have been fulfilled including the resignation of the tv 
director and publication of alleged election irregularities 
but according to bta the students drew up a new list of demands 
friday they have demanded that a date be set for a public trial of 
zhivkov 78 who is in detention he has been charged with 
misappropriation of state property inciting ethnic hostility and 
grave abuse of power 
they also demand the removal of parliamentary deputies 
associated with the former communist regimes decisions such as 
setting up harsh prison camps and agreeing to take part in the 1968 
sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia

security lapses including a metal 
detector that had been adjusted by workers tired of their steeltoe 
boots setting it off prompted a suspension of all nuclear 
operations at the rocky flats plant officials say 
plutonium operations at the government plant were halted in 
november while safety and management improvements were made the 
new ban applies to other rocky flats nuclear operations virtually 
all of which are classified 
the suspension went into effect thursday night following an 
annual inspection by members of the department of energys 
albuquerque nm operations office said rocky flats doe manager 
robert m nelson 
nelson ordered the suspension to allow for correction of the 
shortcomings the duration of the shutdown was not immediately 
known 
the plant run by egampg inc for the department is the nations 
only maker of plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
nelson said investigators discovered that security there could 
be breached and investigators were sent in during the past few 
weeks to try to smuggle out items in their clothing such as 
plutonium and other sensitive materials 
nelson said the only line of defense that failed was a metal 
detector such as that used at airports and there were other lines 
of defense that caught it 
security was lax because workers were wearing steeltoe shoes 
required by federal regulations that kept setting off the metal 
detectors nelson said he said workers became frustrated at having 
to remove their shoes to pass through 
he said said workers are now wearing fiberglasstoe shoes 
plutonium processing operations are shut down right now so 
this was a good time to do it he said maybe we overreacted 
when we shut down the plant they only made it through one line of 
defense but to me thats enough to stop everything 
nelson said other violations were found but none were 
showstoppers they included such things as improper access to 
classified documents and improper handling of chemicals he said 
he would not elaborate 
energy secretary james watkins ordered the halt to plutonium 
operations late last year to let egampg address safety and 
environmental concerns

experts from both east and west germany have 
held their first full talks on the final stage of creating a single 
nation and some sticking points emerged 
also friday east germany was hit by factory workers warning 
strikes and farmers threats to dump their milk because the shift 
from communism to capitalism is hurting them 
guenther krause east germanys top negotiator and the 
parliament state secretary said friday the two sides agreed on a 
timetable of meetings that will result in a final unity treaty by 
the end of august 
krause also said the exact date of allgerman elections 
expected in december would be decided by the end of this month 
the two nations are negotiating a treaty that will reconcile the 
differing laws of the countries and build a political framework for 
a united germany 
one point of disagreement is the new nations capital 
krause said the treaty should mandate that berlin is the capital 
of a united germany but west german interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble told reporters the decision on the capital should be made 
by a newly elected parliament of both nations 
bonn is now the west german capital and east berlin is the east 
german capital 
the political treaty would have to be ratified by both 
parliaments east germany would then hold elections in october to 
create five state governments to match the west german state 
government system 
under one proposal common german elections would be held in 
december and the two countries would formally merge a day later 
the political treaty would be the companion piece of the 
economic pact that went into effect on sunday and formally combined 
the economies of the two german states 
the economic merger triggered soaring prices in east germany 
where lawmakers on friday passed a law to break up state grocery 
chains that suddenly had become unregulated monopolies 
lawmaker gerhard schultz said the new rule should help stop the 
exorbitant prices and price dictating 
the law allows local governments to sell the stores of the huge 
grocery chains ho and konsum in their towns to private buyers 
under the former communist system all prices in state stores were 
set by the government 
on friday 120000 factory workers were striking for job 
protection and higher wages to compensate for rising prices and 
farmers buffeted by western competition threatened to spill unsold 
milk in the streets 
farmers in southern leipzig said friday they would dump 2640 
gallons of milk on the streets monday to protest the loss of 
business the east german news agency adn said 
east german workers have been staging daily warning strikes 
to demand higher wages and protection against widespread 
joblessness expected as east german enterprises confront western 
competition 
the east german affiliate of the powerful west german 
metalworkers union ig metall called more strikes friday at 
factories in east berlin frankfurt an der oder cottbus potsdam 
hennigsdorf and eberswalde 
more than 120000 workers took part in onehour rallies said 
detlef kuchenbecker spokesman for the west german union 
the strikes were held to coincide with negotiations between the 
metal union and 151 berlinarea factories represented by a newly 
formed east german employers association 
ig metall is seeking labor contracts similar to those it has in 
west germany

some of the homeless had lived under the 
trees across from city hall for more than two years but within 
hours the transients occupation of civic center plaza seemed like 
it had never taken place 
office workers ate lunch under the olive trees in the oneblock 
park and children played tag on the grass mothers wheeled their 
babies on the paths and old men sat on benches reading newspapers 
and chatting 
police rousted some 100 transients from their illegal camp 
before dawn friday the deadline set by mayor art agnos five 
people were arrested for refusing to leave and another half dozen 
arrests took place later in the day 
the liberal mayor who had been under pressure to restore the 
showpiece park to public use was enforcing a city ordinance 
banning camping in public places 
after city workers had moved the transients tents sleeping 
bags and assorted possessions to homeless shelters and hauled away 
trash the plaza had an uncharacteristically pristine appearance by 
midday 
dozens of people who previously steered clear of the park 
reclaimed the lawns and benches 
i just sat on the bench enjoying the sunshine city hall 
employee tony pacheco said normally i wouldnt do that it 
looked like a campground until today 
there was a whole bunch of people before and we were 
afraid said karen valdez 9 who played with her sister and two 
brothers we didnt come a lot to the park because there were 
drunk people around here 
police said they planned roundtheclock patrols of the park 
which was virtually deserted friday night to discourage the 
homeless from returning 
one homeless men who had camped at the park for months pledged 
to return even if it meant being arrested 
ill just lay here and let them take me because im right 
im talking about the united states ive got rights said kenny 
martin 40 
martin said he had nowhere else to go he characterized the 
citys shelters including two that opened this week as 
warehousing and claimed they had no vacancies 
but larry bush an assistant to the mayor said no one has 
been turned away on thursday night the two new shelters with a 
total of 140 beds had about 20 vacancies he said 
scores of homeless people have lived in the plaza for several 
years and their numbers swelled to more than 300 after the oct 17 
earthquake which destroyed or made uninhabitable many residential 
hotels 
police officers used a lowkey friendly approach in telling 
the campers to leave said police chief frank jordan 
were going to take it a day at a time but long term we think 
it is a step in the right direction he said 
five homeless people went to court friday asking a judge to 
stop the arrests 
they claimed the ordinance violates the rights of the homeless 
and that the arrests are cruel and unusual punishment because the 
homeless have nowhere else to go 
superior court judge john dearman refused to block the arrests 
but set a july 23 hearing

auto crashes homicides suicides and swimming 
accidents account for threequarters of the deaths of more than 
22000 young people in this country each year the national centers 
for disease control says 
nearly 13 percent of the 22411 fatal injuries to children in 
1986 were homicides second only to motor vehicle accidents the 
agency said friday it said 1986 is the latest year for which 
complete statistics are available 
auto accidents accounted for 10535 deaths in people under 20 in 
1986 and between 15 percent and 30 percent of those deaths were 
associated with alcohol researchers said 
the agency said 2877 people under age 20 died from homicide in 
1986 and 660 of them or 23 percent were under 5 
suicide was the third leading cause of childhood fatal injuries 
accounting for 2151 deaths in 1986 males accounted for 80 
percent and the suicide rate was roughly twice as high for whites 
as for blacks 
drowning the fourth leading cause of childhood fatal injuries 
killed 2062 youths it was the most common fatal injury among kids 
under 5 and among young men 1519 
death rates for children from causes other than injuries dropped 
by 56 percent between 1968 and 1986 deaths from injuries fell 22 
percent in the same period the agency said 
in 1986 a total of 71383 people under 20 died in this country 
dr juan rodriguez a cdc injury research specialist said that 
if the deaths of infants are not included injuries account for 64 
percent of deaths in the under20 age group 
most homicides he said were among the older adolescents the 
15to19yearolds but a lot were the young children that is 
quite worrisome 
sixtyeight percent of the young homicides occurred among males 
and rates for black children were about five times higher than for 
white children 
a companion cdc report noted that fire officials in arizonas 
maricopa county recorded 243 calls for drownings and near drownings 
involving kids under 5 in 198889 about half of those incidents 
probably could have been prevented with pool fences and adequate 
gates and latches the cdc said 
arizona the agency said has a high risk of child drownings 
because of the large number of swimming pools there maricopa 
county alone which includes the phoenix area has an estimated 
125000 public and private pools 
another type of injury fire and burns killed 1619 young 
people in the us in 1986 53 percent of those deaths occurred 
among kids under 5 and 73 percent occurred among kids under 10 
for many deadly childhood injuries preventive measures exist or 
are being developed the agency said among the measures cited are 
car air bags pedestrian barriers and enclosing swimming pools with 
fences

angry about an international 
whaling commission decision to continue a ban on commercial 
whaling japan is threatening to quit the 37nation regulatory body 
japan blasted the commission friday for overwhelmingly rejecting 
a proposal a day earlier to lift the ban on certain types of 
commercial whaling it said the commission caved in to pressure 
from environmental groups 
japan says the minke whale the smallest commercially viable 
whale is no longer in danger of extinction supported by norway 
and iceland it called for exempting the minke whale from the ban 
but the commission by more than a twothirds majority upheld a 
1986 moratorium on all commercial whale hunting 
a group of nations voted as a likeminded bloc and for their 
advice relied on a minority of scientists that are mostly 
affiliated with antiwhaling organizations said alan macnow 
spokesman for the japanese delegation 
the japanese are going to give it another year at least to see 
if the group will accept its proposals for limited commercial 
whaling of the minke whale macnow warned 
if not the delegation will recommend to their government that 
they form another whaling organization he said 
macnow said the japanese held talks with delegates from norway 
and iceland to determine the character of a possible new body 
gudmunder eiriksson the leader of icelands delegation also 
accused the commission of allowing politics to pervade in its 
decisions 
the ban on whaling will continue for one more year until the 
commissions next meeting which is scheduled to be held in iceland 
compliance with the ban is voluntary among members of the 
commission which has no enforcement powers 
the international whaling commission was set up in 1946 by 
international treaty the organization which includes all the 
worlds major whaling nations works to save whales from extinction 
the whaling mortatorium was instituted in 1986 after nearly all 
the major whale species had been hunted to nearextinction 
the commission voted friday to begin surveying the worlds 
dolphin and porpoise populations those fishes have increasingly 
become the prey of whale fishermen deprived of their customary 
catch by the fouryear ban 
in the early 1960s when japanese whaling was at its peak 
whales provided about 23 percent of all meat consumed in the 
country since then declining whale supplies have turned it into a 
delicacy

hundreds of firefighters today spent 
another night defending the village of tok from a 50000acre 
wildfire at its edge statewide more than 180 fires have blackened 
an estimated 400 square miles 
fire was burning friday night to within a halfmile of tok a 
community of about 900 people along the alaska highway 260 miles 
northeast of anchorage 
but most residents planned to leave a shelter and sleep in their 
own homes overnight firefighters had widened the firebreaks 
protecting the village and the winds pushing the flames through 
the spruce forests and tundra had dropped 
mother nature dealt us a good hand its overcast and the 
temperatures are cooler so we didnt get active burning really 
said rob mcwhorter a bureau of land management spokesman on 
thursday the fire burned to within a quarter mile of the village 
because of gusty winds 
despite the apparent stall in the fire mcwhorter said it was 
too soon to declare the danger over 
todays weather is supposed to be the same kind of high 
temperature relative low humidity and possible gusting winds that 
was the situation when the fire blew up thursday he said 
were not out of the woods yet 
traffic was a stopandgo affair for a second day on the alaska 
highway a primary route for travelers heading north to fairbanks 
or south to anchorage 
authorities closed the highway nine miles outside of town for 
about a halfhour in early afternoon because of fire and heavy 
smoke traffic then was restricted to one way only cars had to be 
led through the haze by a pilot car 
at least 396 square miles were burned across a wide midsection 
of the nations largest state but equipment crews and attention 
have been focused on the tok fire the only one posing a 
significant threat to people and property 
statewide an estimated 1200 firefighters were deployed as 37 
new fires friday brought to 184 the number burning out of control 
across alaskas interior said pat flowers a fire spokesman 
most of the fires were blamed on nearrecord heat low humidity 
and lightning which struck an estimated 2300 times in a oneday 
period ending friday night 
no injuries or fatalities have been blamed on the fires which 
began last weekend

americans living abroad say the us government 
isnt doing enough to help them solve problems involving taxes 
voting education and citizenship 
the us expatriates concluded their first world conference 
friday by urging the government not to ignore them just because 
they dont live in the united states 
john f crawford the meetings cochairman said the twoday 
gathering could eventually lead to an expatriates bill of 
rights 
he argued that creating better conditions for the estimated 3 
million us citizens abroad could help american competitiveness in 
world markets 
the 200 expatriates who came from as far away as brazil and 
nigeria for the paris gathering said the united states lags behind 
other nations in helping its citizens overseas 
for example the united states is the only industrial nation 
that taxes citizen overseas on income earned abroad it allows 
expatriates no representation in congress unlike france for one 
whose overseas citizens have six senate representatives 
overseas americans can have problems ensuring citizenship for 
their children and their schools unlike those for japanese 
germans and french living abroad receive no government help 
the expatriates are also denied medicare and medicaid even 
though they make social security payments 
the group said its goals included congressional representation 
a congressional task force to deal with their problems and a 
highlevel panel made up of representatives of various government 
agencies to handle expatriate concerns 
other ideas discussed at the conference included teacher 
exchange programs bringing innercity american children to foreign 
american schools to widen their horizons and getting more overseas 
americans to participate in us elections 
rep mervyn m dymally rcalif said he already was taking 
steps to set up a congressional task force dymally who was one of 
10 members of congress at the paris meeting presided over hearings 
last november on overseas americans he said more hearings were 
planned this fall 
ben blaz who represents the pacific territory of guam in 
congress said overseas americans would have to work to win the 
attention of washington or their needs would continue to be ignored 
the burden is on you to change that attitude he said 
the meeting was sponsored by the association of americans 
resident overseas the european council of american chambers of 
commerce american citizens abroad democrats abroad federation of 
american womens clubs overseas and republicans abroad 
crawford said the mainly europebased groups that organized the 
meeting would try to bring together other americansabroad groups 
in the middle east latin american and asia 
the coalition will try to convene a second conference in 
washington in the spring of 1991 he said

federal investigators were sent to 
examine the wreckage of a chemical plant today to find the cause of 
a thunderous explosion that killed 17 workers and sent dozens of 
employees scrambling for safety 
two tanks that collected waste water and flammable hydrocarbons 
exploded at the arco chemical co plant about 15 miles east of 
houston late thursday the blast could be heard 20 miles away 
when i heard it i knew what had happened said employee 
kathryn cox i hollered to my people yall run run as fast as 
you can i looked back twice and then i just kept running because 
i knew if it went again wed probably get blown up 
the explosion leveled an area the size of a city block five 
people including two people living near the complex suffered 
minor injuries 
investigators with the occupational safety and health 
administration were to inspect the charred twisted metal today in 
hopes of finding the cause 
the roof of a threestory 900000gallon tank blew off and 
landed 100 yards away in a parking lot the rest of the tower was 
scattered over a blockwide area several smaller explosions 
followed a smaller connecting tank was blackened 
it looks like a tornado or fire went through that area said 
assistant us labor secretary gerard f scannell who is leading 
an investigation of the accident 
osha investigators are looking into a number of aspects at arco 
including the maintenance record and complaints from family members 
that some employees were having to work long hours scannell said 
plant manager earl mccaleb said the tanks were in operation but 
he added that it was believed that some kind of work was being 
done on a compressor which compresses gases before they enter the 
tanks 
seventeen bodies were pulled from the debris one victim an 
employee of a waste hauling company was found in the cab of his 
truck officials said 
five other victims were arco chemical employees and 11 were 
employed by a contractor austin industrial inc of houston 
more than 50 people were working in the plant at the time 
officials said the plant has more than 350 employees 
we were running through the mud just as fast as we could get 
out of there said tommy mcbridge a plant worker we knew what 
it was 
the fire was out by daybreak friday plant firefighters sprayed 
down the wreckage while other workers searched for bodies amid the 
twisted pipes and other debris 
the plant had one previous safety citation received in 1988 for 
a death at an offsite fire training facility mccaleb said 
the plant produces propylene oxide used to make flexible foam 
for seat cushions and bedding the substance also is used for 
cleaning compounds 
in addition the plant makes styrene monomer used for 
insulation foam drinking cups packaging materials and auto parts 
and methyl tertiary butyl ether a highoctane blending component 
used instead of lead in gasoline 
arco chemical based outside philadelphia has been running the 
plant since 1980 three years after it went into operation 
it was the second major loss of life at a houstonarea 
petrochemical plant in nine months on oct 23 a phillips 
petroleum co plastics plant in pasadena was hit by series of 
explosions that killed 23 workers and injured 130 
on june 8 two people were injured in an explosion and fire at a 
chemical packaging plant in pearland south of houston

hundreds of supporters of former 
first lady imelda marcos drove around the capital today held 
demonstrations and offered masses and prayers to celebrate her 
acquittal of racketeering charges in new york 
about 130 cars and minibuses filled with marcos loyalists drove 
through manilas major roads flashing victory signs and 
shouting marcos still to show their happiness over mondays 
verdict clearing mrs marcos 
mrs marcos with saudi financier adnan khashoggi were cleared of 
federal racketeering and fraud charges she had been accused of 
helping loot the philippine treasury of 222 million and spending 
the money to buy art and real estate much of it in new york 
many of the vehicles carried placards praising the american jury 
that cleared the 61yearold mrs marcos other placards were 
saying the acquittal showed that mrs marcos was innocent 
the caravan momentarily stopped by a hospital and the seaside 
cultural center where mrs marcos built several exhibition and 
convention halls during the 20year rule of the her late husband 
ousted president ferdinand marcos 
marcos and his family fled the philippines in february 1986 
after a civilianbacked military rebellion toppled his government 
and installed mrs corazon aquino to the presidency 
the former philippine strongman died in exile in hawaii last 
september before the racketeering charges in which his wife was 
acquitted went on trial 
mrs marcos however also faces court proceedings in 
switzerland in which the philippine government seeks to recover 
hundreds of millions of dollars the marcoses allegedly robbed from 
the treasury 
later today the motorcade broke into two groups and held 
separate rallies about 3000 loyalists attended a rally and mass 
at the seaside luneta park near the us embassy some 500 others 
demonstrated infront of the central post office building a few 
miles away 
we have reason to rejoice said rally de guzman a leader of 
one of several loyalist groups at the luneta the verdict favored 
the first lady because she was innocent the charges were filed by 
her political enemies and you know how dirty politics can be 
de guzman said they were still awaiting word from mrs marcos on 
whether her lawyers in manila would file a new petition before the 
supreme court asking the tribunal to allow her to return following 
her acquittal 
the high court had earlier agreed to a government ban on the 
return of mrs aquino saying she remains a threat to national

the louisiana senate has passed a bill 
that would require the music industry to put warning labels on 
recordings with themes of rape murder suicide drugs child abuse 
and satanic worship 
the measure passed 289 friday it goes back to the house for 
approval of amendments 
we pass bills all the time to have clean air clean water 
said sen oswald decuir why cant we do something to clean up 
the environment for children 
the measure originally made retailers responsible for labeling 
records tapes and compact discs but it was amended to put the 
onus on the recording industry 
a manufacturer could be fined up to 3000 for each item sold to 
a minor without the label a retailer who fails to heed the label 
and sells such a recording to a minor could get up to six months in 
jail and a 1000 fine 
opponents questioned the measures constitutionality and warned 
that the local economy could lose millions of dollars 
the national academy of recording arts and sciences has said it 
will no longer consider new orleans as a site for the grammy hall 
of fame if the bill becomes law the national association of record 
merchandisers has threatened to cancel a 1992 convention in new 
orleans 
in may the record industry unveiled a voluntary labeling system 
that it hoped would halt campaigns in some states for mandatory 
labeling it became effective this month 
jay berman president of the recording industry association of 
america said at the time that 16 of the 21 state legislatures 
considering such bills had backed down since the industry announced 
its plans 
earlier this week capitol records promised to provide legal 
help to store operators threatened with arrest for selling its 
recordings that bear labels warning consumers of sexually explicit 
lyrics 
last month two members of the rap group 2 live crew were 
arrested in florida for performing songs from their sexually

a defense lawyer suggested that the jogger who 
was beaten nearly to death in central park might not have been 
raped 
the question came up during crossexamination friday of dr 
robert kurtz the surgeon who supervised the the womans treatment 
at metropolitan hospital 
under questioning by robert burns a lawyer for one of three 
teenagers charged with rape and attempted murder in the 1989 
attack kurtz testified that there was no evidence of injury in the 
womans genital or rectal area 
he added that lack of such evidence is not unusual in rape cases 
the defense attorney did not ask kurtz directly whether he was 
certain the jogger had been raped outside the courtroom he said 
what we are really saying is that the examination of the genital 
area did not show any injury 
burns went on to say that if the jogger was fighting 
vigorously as a woman who is resisting would there should have 
been some evidence of injury 
but kurtz said you dont fight with your genitals you fight 
with your arms and legs and fists 
the jogger a 29yearold investment banker was jumped by a 
gang of youths in the park and apparently left for dead she 
recovered and is back at work 
on trial are yusef salaam 16 antron mccray 15 and raymond

dartman the mystery figure who gets his kicks 
blowing darts at the backs and buttocks of welldressed women 
could turn more violent if he remains on the loose a psychologist 
says 
next stage would be bullets instead of darts harvey 
schlossberg former head of the police departments psychological 
services unit was quoted as saying in todays daily news 
he has got to increase the amount of pain and reaction by the 
victim to give himself pleasure 
on friday hours after police commissioner lee brown appealed 
for help from the public the attacker hit his 52nd victim since 
june 26 all the attacks have taken place in daylight in midtown 
manhattan the most crowded part of town 
dubbed dartman by the citys tabloids the attacker has 
repeatedly blown twoinch homemade darts at his victims not all of 
the darts have met their mark some becoming entangled in clothing 
and no one has been seriously hurt 
judith blitman a psychiatrist and professor of clinical 
psychology at albert einstein college of medicine suspects the 
attacker will curtail his activities as police close in 
he feels attacked himself she told the daily news hell 
be quite scared by all the publicity

a social worker who allowed a foster child 
to return to his parents home where he was killed for soiling his 
pants plans to appeal after being placed on three years 
probation her lawyer says 
margaret barber 62 who could have been sentenced to up to five 
years in prison was the first employee of the department of health 
and rehabilitative services ever criminally convicted over the 
handling of a case 
ms barber the main fostercare worker for 2yearold bradley 
mcgee of lakeland was found guilty of negligence june 15 in 
recommending to a judge that the foster child be returned to his 
parents while not providing the court with a psychological report 
describing the parents as explosive and infantile 
bradley died two months later of head injuries after repeatedly 
being shoved head first into a toilet for soiling his pants 
authorities said 
thomas coe 23 and sheryl coe 21 each were charged with 
firstdegree murder and aggravated child abuse in the childs 
death mrs coe pleaded no contest to seconddegree murder and is 
serving 30 years in prison while her husband faces trial next week 
in fort myers 
i believe i did everything with the best of intentions and 
there were no malicious acts ms barber said before sentencing 
friday 
but circuit judge j tim strickland said negligence not evil 
intent was the issue 
ms barbers lawyer john liguori said he planned to appeal the 
conviction on grounds that crucial evidence was disallowed and that 
the jury didnt take its job seriously even reportedly throwing a 
party during deliberations 
to some extent margaret barber was the scapegoat for whatever 
failings were in the system liguori said 
i will carry on ms barber told about 100 fellow hrs 
workers who cheered her as she left court so far her colleagues 
have raised more than 1000 for her appeal 
public outrage over bradleys death led legislators to change 
the law to make child safety a top priority instead of family 
reunification 
three other hrs workers were cleared of misdemeanor charges in 
the case

a powerful aftershock jolted 
quakeshattered northwestern iran overnight panicking residents 
setting off landslides and injuring two people official media 
reported today 
the official islamic republic news agency also reported a tremor 
near the southern iranian city of yazd this morning but it was 
considerably less powerful than the aftershock in the north 
irna and tehran radio monitored in nicosia said the aftershock 
struck the city of rudbar in gilan province at 1105 pm friday 
335 am edt today tehran universitys geophysics center said 
it registered 59 on the richter scale 
more than 400 aftershocks have hit gilan since the devastating 
june 21 earthquake which killed about 40000 people injured 
60000 and left about half a million people homeless the initial 
quake was measured at between 73 and 77 on the richter scale 
the aftershock friday was felt in tehran but caused no 
casualties or damage in the iranian capital irna said 
the quake near yazd 370 miles from tehran measured 49 on the 
richter scale the center said 
the agency and the radio initially reported rudbar had been hit 
by a new earthquake but in later dispatches irna called it an 
aftershock 
irna said two people in rudbar were taken to hospitals for 
treatment the earthquakeflattened city has only makeshift relief 
clinics however 
the news agency said the aftershock triggered landslides in the 
mountainous region that blocked two main roads but it said crews 
immediately moved in and worked until the roads were cleared 
gilan and zanjan another agricultural province to its south 
bore the brunt of the june 21 quake 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude an earthquake measuring 5 on the richter scale can 
cause considerable damage and one registering 6 can cause severe 
damage 
iranian interior minister abdollah nouri said this week that it 
would be overwhelmingly difficult to rebuild the 
earthquakestricken region 
the interior minister said iran needed to repair roads water 
systems and electrical service as well as replace buildings the 
cost just to repair residences and the water and electrical systems 
will be 1 billion he said 
he said 90000 residences had been damaged in the quake most of 
them were made of mud brick or kilndried brick with little 
reinforcement in the walls 
he said iran had two months to build shelter before the rainy 
season begins in september

the governor of the troubled northern 
state of kashmir ordered an indefinite curfew in the capital 
effective today and gave the army full control of the battle 
against moslem separatists 
soldiers in camouflage uniforms manned checkpoints and patrolled 
in machinegun mounted jeeps strictly enforcing the curfew said 
residents who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the hindudominated government announced a special powers 
ordinance giving the army command of countering the moslem 
insurgency newspapers reported in the past the army was 
subordinate to the police and paramilitary forces 
residents said they feared the move could be the start of a 
fresh crackdown and more violence in the state which borders 
moslem pakistan 
jammukashmir gov girish saxena signed the order friday 
permitting army troops to conduct searches and destroy militant 
hideouts and ordering an indefinite curfew in srinagar the 
newspapers said 
on thursday saxena empowered security forces to fire at any 
suspected insurgent and search and destroy any building 
srinagar has been the focal point of the moslem movement for 
secession of the kashmir valley from hindumajority india 
at least 668 people have been killed in the picturesque 
himalayan valley since jan 20 when the government first ordered a 
crackdown on moslem insurgents 
however the insurrection has shown no signs of abating 
jammukashmir state is the only one of indias 25 states which 
has a moslem majority a separatist movement has been simmering in 
the kashmir valley since 1947 after its hindu ruler opted for 
union with india when the subcontinent was divided into 
hindumajority india and islamic pakistan 
the insurgency flared this year after moslem insurgents dropped 
their demand for union with pakistan and began agitating for 
independence and the status of an neutral nation 
the government responded by dismissing the state government and 
bringing the province under the federallyappointed governor 
on friday interior minister mufti mohammed sayeed said the 
state would be brought under direct federal rule from july 19 when 
six months of governors rule expires 
the decision is a technicality since gov saxena will remain 
the federal governments representative in the state but it 
indicates that the government has no immediate plans to hold 
elections to the state assembly 
under state law governors rule cannot be extended beyond six 
months but federal or presidents rule can remain in force for up 
to three years

south korea may join north korea in 
opening a strip of border for the first time in four decades an 
influential newspaper said today 
north korea said friday it would open a portion of its frontier 
at the truce village of panmunjom on aug 15 in order to promote 
korean unity and called on south korea to do the same 
south korea initially dismissed the move as propaganda but the 
donga ilbo newspaper quoting an unidentified government official 
said today that seoul was reconsidering 
also today kim daejung south koreas bestknown opposition 
politician expressed support for the north korean move and asked 
the seoul government to broaden contact with north korea at all 
levels 
kim addressing a rally also urged the seoul government to 
accept a north korean proposal to share a single seat in the united 
nations with rotating representation 
in another development today south korean officials said north 
korea agreed to reopen talks aimed at setting up a joint meeting of 
lawmakers from the capitalist south and the communist north the 
talks suspended since january were to resume july 19 
longtime observers expressed hopes that this weeks developments 
could lead to an easing of tensions between the koreas the 
peninsula has been divided since 1945 
northsouth negotiators agreed in principle this week to meet 
july 26 to sign accords for a historic first meeting of prime 
ministers of the two nations the talks are expected to be held in 
seoul in august 
north korea said friday it would open an 800yard stretch of 
border at panmunjom a truce village inside the 25milewide 
demilitarized zone on aug 15 korea was liberated from japan on 
that date in 1945 
panmunjom is an ovalshaped enclave straddling a western portion 
of the 155mile border between the two koreas it is where military 
officials of both sides meet to discuss alleged armistice 
violations the area is offlimits to civilians 
north korea said it would not allow outsiders to travel into the 
north beyond the perimeter of panmunjom 
the initial south korean response was negative but donga said 
some within the government were rethinking their stance 
although the north korean move is believed to be propaganda 
we would not reject it totally we would rather use it to help ease 
tension and bring them to openness the paper quoted the 
unidentified official as saying 
the paper said the south korean government may reciprocate by 
opening its own sector of panmunjom and suggest that the border 
village be made a meeting place for 10 million separated family 
members in the two koreas 
south korea also may propose building a peace city jointly 
with north korea inside the demilitarized zone it said 
north korea has rejected similar proposals in the past 
seoul officials said they suspect that the north korean move is 
aimed at encouraging south korean dissidents to hold a unification 
rally at panmunjom on aug 15 
a major south korean dissident group chonminyon welcomed the 
north korean announcement and said it will send 300 delegates to 
meet with north koreans that day 
the seoul government bans unauthorized contact with north korea 
by its citizens it contends dialogue with the north koreans must 
be conducted through official channels

irans official news agency reported 
today that one of the 16 western hostages held in lebanon most 
likely a european will probably be freed soon 
most western hostages in lebanon are believed held by factions 
of hezbollah or party of god a fundamentalist shiite moslem group 
that gets considerable financial support from iran 
a western hostage held in lebanon will probably be released 
soon said the islamic republic news agencys fivesentence 
dispatch from beirut lebanon citing informed sources 
it said the sources refused to disclose the identity of the 
hostage to be released but hinted that he is most probably a 
european national 
the englishlanguage irna report monitored in nicosia said 
it is not known when and where the hostage will be released 
the hostages include six americans and 10 europeans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an italian and an irishman 
in beirut a source close to the syrian army command said if a 
hostage were to be released it would probably be brian keenan 
the irishman who also holds a british passport the source spoke on 
condition of anonymity and refused to provide any other information 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon it has 40000 troops 
in northern and eastern provinces as well as the moslem sector of 
the capital 
keenan 39 was kidnapped in moslem west beirut april 11 1986 
as he walked from his home to the american university of beirut 
where he taught english 
no group has claimed the abduction of keenan of belfast but 
american educator frank reed said after his release in april that 
he had seen keenan 
two underground factions in lebanon the organization of islamic 
dawn and the arab revolutionary cellsomar mukhtar brigade had 
claimed to hold reed 
iran played a key role in mediating the release of reed and 
another american hostage in lebanon robert polhill 
the first word of a possible release of hostages in april had 
come from irna in short similarly worded dispatches within days 
polhill was freed and reeds release followed 
iran said then it would work for the release of other hostages 
if the united states and western governments make a gesture of 
goodwill 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani and other iranian officials 
suggested that western governments pressure israel to release about 
300 inmates most of them lebanese shiites held at a detention 
camp in south lebanon 
the inmates are suspected guerrillas involved in an underground 
warfare against israeli troops and allied militiamen of the south 
lebanon army who control a border strip in south lebanon 
israel has said it would not agree to any such deal unless it 
also involved freeing three israeli servicemen believed held by 
shiite groups after disappearing in south lebanon 
an outpouring of western assistance to iran after the 
devastating june 21 earthquake had raised hopes in some quarters 
that iran might use its influence with the proiranian groups 
believed holding the hostages 
rafsanjani has said iran should be grateful for the foreign 
quake aid however in comments earlier this month he made no link 
between such aid and the release of any western hostages 
rafsanjani seeking closer ties with the west has been in 
conflict with hardline moslem fundamentalists in the government 
who oppose his efforts 
iran also has demanded that the western governments help shed 
light on the fate of four iranians who were kidnapped in 1982 by a 
rightwing lebanese christian militia in north lebanon 
christian leader samir geagea has said that when he seized 
command of the lebanese forces militia in 1985 he found no trace 
of the iranians and blamed their murder on his rival predecessor 
elie hobeika 
but iranian officials have in recent weeks insisted that they 
have word that the missing iranians are still alive 
terry a anderson chief middle east bureau chief for the 
associated press is the longestheld western hostage in lebanon 
he was abducted march 16 1985

a christian science couple convicted of 
manslaughter for relying on prayer to heal their dying son said 
they would abide by a judges order to take their other children to 
a doctor for regular checkups 
the requirement was part of the 10 years probation handed out 
friday to david and ginger twitchell 
we always tried to obey the law both in 86 and now and 
well try to obey the judges instructions twitchell said 
the couple were convicted wednesday of recklessly and wantonly 
causing the death in 1986 of their 2yearold son robyn by not 
seeking medical care for the boy who had a bowel obstruction they 
could have received 20 years in prison 
superior court judge sandra hamlin imposed probation under 
maximum supervision and ordered the couple to take their three 
remaining children for checkups under guidelines set by the 
american medical association 
hamlin also said that at any signs of serious illness in the 
children who range in age from 9 months to 8 years a doctor 
must be called in 
in a statement twitchell said that while he would obey the 
order he would always pray first for his childrens health 
we have never ruled out medical care we just feel prayer 
gods power is a lot better said twitchell 
the former boston residents both 34 now live in brentwood ny 
the christian science church teaches that sickness can be healed 
by spiritual means alone church officials have said the case is an 
attack on their religion and expressed confidence the verdict will 
be overturned on appeal 
the trial has garnered wide attention in part because it was 
held in boston where the christian science church has its 
headquarters 
since 1980 there have been seven prosecutions of christian 
science parents on such charges as murder manslaughter and 
neglect five have been convicted one acquitted and one case was 
thrown out child rights activist rita swan 
no one was jailed in those cases 
prosecutor john kiernan had asked for a long period of probation 
for the twitchells periodic checkups of their children and a 
requirement for community service 
defense attorney steve lyons had asked that the twitchells 
receive four years probation with no conditions he said required 
checkups would place a medical policeman in the twitchell home 
when there are no guarantees with medicine

west germany welcomed results of the 
nato alliance meeting especially a decision that the size of a 
united german military should be negotiated at ongoing arms talks 
in vienna 
but east german prime minister lothar de maiziere and his 
foreign minister criticized the alliance for not renouncing the 
first use of nuclear weapons in europe where the sovietled warsaw 
pact alliance is unraveling 
de maiziere in an interview friday night with west germanys 
zdf television network said the results of the london summit 
which ended friday in many points remained behind our 
expectations 
he said the process of german unification would be considerably 
easier if nato would abandon its policy of flexible response 
and renounce the first use of nuclear weapons 
flexible response leaves open the possibility that the north 
atlantic treaty organization could counter a conventional attack 
with nuclear weapons 
the strategy was developed as a deterrent against the warsaw 
pacts superior numbers of troops and tanks but the sovietled 
alliance is losing strength and relevance after last years 
democratic upheaval in eastern europe 
the nato leaders in concluding their twoday summit said the 
alliance would from now on regard its own nuclear arms as weapons 
of last resort 
but at the insistence of britain they said there are no 
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military 
action might be discounted 
the leaders also proposed the elimination of nuclear artillery 
shells from europe but nato will still have 700 shortrange lance 
missiles in europe 
east germanys foreign minister markus meckel said the danger 
of a nuclear war in europe remained as long as nato has an arms mix 
of conventional and atomic weapons according to the east german 
news agency adn 
we believe that europe doesnt need atomic weapons for its 
security this is why we reject for germany the stationing 
ownership and transport of such mass means of destruction adn 
quoted meckel as saying 
meckels west german counterpart hansdietrich genscher was 
considerably more upbeat calling the london gathering a historic 
summit for europe 
the german delegation was very satisfied with the outcome of 
the summit a government source said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
another source said it was our very clear intention to have 
the size of a united germany military negotiated at the 
conventional arms talks in vienna 
the soviet union had wanted the question of german troop levels 
one of the contentious points in discussions over approaching 
german unification negotiated in the twoplusfour talks among 
the four world war ii victors and the germanys 
west germany rejected that idea not wanting its forces to be 
singled out among europe 
negotiating the size of germanys military in the 
twoplusfour talks would have amounted to the victorious world 
war ii allies setting german troop limits 
but negotiating it in the context of the conventional armed 
forces in europe talks puts the question in the broader context of 
european security 
genscher in an interview from london with west germanys rias 
radio said the summit had sent a clear and significant political 
signal to the soviet union and eastern europe that there would be 
cooperation on disarmament 
and he said germany could lead the way in that cooperation by 
giving the soviets assurances on what would be the future strength 
of a united german military 
west germanys fulltime military troop level is 465000 with 
30000 activeduty reservists who can be called into action 
immediately 
east germanys military strength debilitated by defections 
following the collapse of the communist government is 97000 east 
germanys defense ministry said this week 
defense ministry sources in bonn said this week the government 
was willing to consider limiting postunification troop strengths 
to about 400000 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said at the last 
round of twoplusfour talks in berlin the soviets would like 
to see a united german army of between 200000 and 250000 troops

a terrorist suspected of 
belonging to the red army who gave herself up to west german police 
has agreed to speak out on the groups structure and recent 
attacks according to news reports today 
but the woman susanne albrecht has refused to detail alleged 
ties between terrorists and east germanys ousted communist 
leadership der spiegel magazine reported 
albrecht 39 was arrested in east germany but voluntarily 
surrendered to west german police last week she was one of eight 
alleged red army members who lived in east germany under false 
identities supposedly supplied by the nowdisbanded east german 
secret police 
west germany had a warrant out for her arrest for her alleged 
role in the july 30 1977 shooting death of west german banker 
juergen ponto 
der spiegels article is to appear in its monday issue but an 
advance text was provided by the magazine today der spiegel did 
not say how it had obtained information on her testimony to police 
the magazine quoted west germanys chief prosecutor alexander 
von stahl as saying he did not expect the seven other red army 
suspects held in east germany to be extradited 
instead von stahl said the seven would probably stand trial 
under west german law after the two germanys formally unite 
theres hardly time to begin criminal extradition 
proceedings before unification von stahl said a formal merger 
of the two german states is expected in december 
however von stahl did call on the seven suspects still in east 
german custody to surrender to west german authorities 
no group in east germany has taken responsibility for hiding the 
red army suspects although west german media have accused ousted 
communist party chief erich honecker and the head of the stasi 
erich mielke of doing so 
the hardline communist leadership was ousted last year

rebels have tightened their noose on 
the capital attacking the port near the fortified mansion of 
besieged president samuel k doe 
dont die for doe rebels only two miles from the executive 
beachfront enclave urged demoralized government troops on friday 
many soldiers were abandoning their posts 
meanwhile renewed talks to end the 6monthold civil war in 
this west african nation stalled friday because a rebel delegation 
had not reached the negotiating site in neighboring freetown 
sierra leone 
doe who seized power in a bloody coup in 1980 was holed up in 
his mansion with troops of his minority krahn tribe who have 
remained loyal his top commanders and advisers fled last week 
the rebels led by charles taylor a former doe aide accuse the 
government of corruption and human rights abuses 
automatic rifle fire and artillery blasts echoed across the 
capital from dawn until noon friday and plumes of smoke from 
explosions rose from the city outskirts 
a rebel fishing trawler fired at a coast guard cutter about five 
miles offshore and a cannon from does israelibuilt mansion fired 
two shells into the ocean to deter rebel boats witnesses said the 
rebels withdrew from the port later in the day 
the united states supplied water to the presidents mansion 
under heavy guard by us marines a witness said four american 
vehicles escorted a water tanker to the mansion early friday 
morning the witness said 
in washington today state department press officer anita 
stockman denied that the united states had escorted tankers or 
delivered water to doe 
the situation remains the same in monrovia were certainly 
not providing water to doe she said 
in abidjan ivory coast diplomatic sources said doe had asked 
the united states to ferry him and 100 troops to his home region of 
grand gedeh county the united states refused the request which 
would have enabled doe to continue the war the sources said 
a senior us government source in washington said doe had 
mentioned a desire to visit his home region but did not ask for 
assistance to get there 
the united states has offered to help doe leave liberia a 
condition set by rebels before they will accept a ceasefire doe 
reportedly has offered to resign on condition his safety and that 
of his krahn tribe is guaranteed 
a senior rebel official based in the united states rejected a 
reported plan for the six west african nations that were leading 
the negotiations to send a peacekeeping force to liberia to oversee 
new elections 
but the rebel official tom woewiyu said he would go to 
freetown for the talks 
soldiers continued to loot in monrovia under cover of a 
dusktodawn curfew but residents said the looting was less 
widespread than during the previous night 
many of the citys 500000 residents searched for food and 
carried buckets of water from rapidly depleting wells 
monrovia has been without water for nine days and without 
electricity for one week most shops and markets have been closed 
all week and some people have been begging for food or collecting 
leaves to eat 
the rebels began attacking the capital on monday but their 
progress has been slow 
rebel sources in ivory coast said 4500 more troops joined the 
original assault contingent of 800 men wednesday night but the 
insurgents failed to live up to their claim that they could take 
monrovia in 12 hours 
the rebels invaded dec 24 from the ivory coast does forces 
then killed hundreds of civilian members of the gio and mano 
tribes seen as the main support base for the rebels the rebels 
sought revenge by killing members of does krahn tribe and the 
mandingo people who have supported him 
rebel leader taylor has gained much support throughout the 
country but the united states and other governments have 
questioned his commitment to democracy and free elections 
reports of summary executions of suspected doe supporters as 
well as the reported execution of one of the founding members of 
taylors movement also have damaged his credibility

president mikhail s gorbachev today forced the 
communist party congress to drop a plan to evaluate each member of 
the partys ruling politburo warning the move would bury the 
party 
despite rampant criticism of his policies by the largely 
hardline congress meeting for its sixth day the soviet leader 
showed his mastery of the delegates by pushing through the reversal 
if you want to bury the party to split the party then 
continue on this way he told delegates but think hard 
before its afternoon break the congress voted 25571393 for 
an individual thumbsup or thumbsdown vote on each politburo 
member delegates later reversed themselves 24951515 after 
hearing gorbachevs opinion 
gorbachev cited a note from the delegation from northern 
arkhangelsk that said there is no need to evaluate each 
politburo member the politburo according to the rules is an 
organ of the leadership and the leadership is collective 
instead the congress agreed to evaluate as a whole the work of 
the policymaking central committee and within it the 12member 
politburo 
evaluating each politburo member separately would have broken a 
tradition of regarding the body as a collective entity the idea 
brought criticism in the corridors of the kremlins palace of 
congresses from reformist delegates 
our russian thirst for blood is showing said inna 
dementyeva a moscow delegate its stupid and ugly and inhuman 
but other party members said they backed the decision because it 
would let future leaders know that they couldnt hide behind 
collective responsibility 
collective responsibility is no responsibility said a 
byelorussian delegate who identified himself only as alexander 
and there should be a full renewal of the leadership 
delegates and reporters standing outside the palace of 
congresses said gorbachev looked angry when he left following the 
initial vote on previous days he stopped to talk with bystanders 
but today he went straight to his car 
congress members had said they expected at least half the 
politburo members would get the thumbs down 
names singled out as most likely to receive negative votes were 
ideology chief vadim a medvedev criticized by many as 
ineffective and alexander yakovlev considered the most radical 
member of the politburo yakovlev has been unapologetic for his 
reformist views before the largely conservative congress 
the evaluations would have had no practical effect because the 
congress chooses a new central committee which would have selected 
a new politburo anyway but they clearly would have left a mark on 
each mans career 
the namebyname voting also likely would have hurt gorbachevs 
position by discrediting some of his allies and helping his rival 
yegor k ligachev who enjoys wide popularity at the congress 
delegates said 
now there could even be the variant that ligachev will come to 
power anatoly tubyshkin a moscow delegate had said its very 
worrying 
the congress had been expected to begin nominating candidates 
for its top post today but by midafternoon it appeared 
nominations would not come by the end of the day 
delegates said there did not appear to be any serious challenge 
to gorbachev as party leader 
at present we do not have outstanding leaders except mikhail 
gorbachev in the party said leningrad party chief boris gidaspov 
in a draft of party rules also expected to come to the floor 
today the partys head would still be called general secretary 
both he and a deputy would be elected by the full congress of about 
4700 delegates 
with gorbachev the presumed winner for the post he has held 
since march 1985 talk in the corridors revolved around who would 
be his deputy and run the partys daytoday affairs 
delegates mentioned ligachev prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
interior minister vadim bakatin and pravda editor ivan frolov as 
contenders gorbachev advisor georgy shakhnazarov said he thought 
the deputy might turn out to be a nearunknown someone 
completely new 
delegates said they expected a massive overhaul of the party 
leadership moscow party secretary yuri prokofiev said today as 
much as 80 percent of the leadership might be changed 
yakovlev and other members have already said they plan to retire 
from the politburo and medvedev indicated today he too would be 
happy to retire and let younger more energetic more 
strongwilled people take over 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party which opened 
last monday appeared likely to adjourn sometime late next week

state television today showed what it 
said was footage of a 1980 meeting in which communist intelligence 
agents tried to persuade the international terrorist carlos to 
leave hungary 
the footage appeared to back up allegations made three weeks ago 
that hungarys former communist leaders had allowed carlos also 
known as the jackal to use the country as a base for his terrorist 
attacks the report did not indicate how long carlos allegedly 
stayed in hungary 
a former communist official interviewed on the program claimed 
that the communists had tried to oust carlos as soon as they 
discovered he was operating in the country the nations communist 
party disbanded in october 
carlos a moscow university graduate began his life as a 
terrorist in 1973 and topped interpols most wanted list by 1975 
in december of that year he allegedly organized an attack in 
vienna on opec oil ministers in which three people were killed 
carlos remains at large 
state television said the meeting shown in the film took place 
in 1980 in an office of the interior ministrys department for the 
supervision of foreigners and was filmed without carloss knowledge 
there was no indication of how the film was obtained 
interior minister balazs horvath said on june 27 that he had 
instructed the chief prosecutor to investigate former communist 
party officials who allegedly provided shelter and training grounds 
for carlos whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez and his 
terrorist group 
the man identified as carlos in the film spoke fluent but 
accented english 
the two hungarian agents spoke hungarian among themselves and 
english to carlos the conversation was poorly recorded and 
difficult to make out at times so the film was subtitled 
one agent told carlos that he must liquidate your base of 
operations here must stop using hungary from where to direct your 
group because there is danger your operations may be compromised 
also if you were to continue the interests of the hungarian 
peoples republic may be jeopardized if you are associated with 
us 
you can travel through hungary or even stay for brief 
periods the hungarian official told carlos trying to mollify 
him 
andras petresevics one of the agents said in an interview on 
the program that the terrorist accused him of being an 
imperialist agent and of acting without the knowledge of his 
superiors to get him to leave 
the former communist chief of counterintelligence miklos redei 
also was interviewed in the program redei who also met carlos 
said he gave the impression of being paranoid afraid but he 
was not dumb 
horvath said last month that recently discovered documents 
implicated the late communist party leader janos kadar former 
interior minister andras benkei former president karoly nemeth 
and antal gyenes former head of the communist partys foreign 
relations department in the carlos case 
one of the documents produced by horvath was a letter allegedly 
written to kadar by carlos in 1980 the same year the terrorist 
apparently left hunagry 
from our base in hungary we have developed our international 
ties getting in contact with the revolutions of every nation 
without any hindrance on the part of the hungarian authorities 
the letter purportedly said 
benkei nemeth and gyenes have denied any role in sheltering 
terrorists 
redei asserted that a small group of terrorists led by carlos 
did not come here at the invitation of any hungarian official we 
tried to keep tabs on them after their arrival at one point we 
lost them said redei carlos was a welltrained agent and 
could spot a tail easily 
redei denied carlos was provided with any training facilities in 
hungary 
he said fear of the terrorist kept hungarian authorities from 
acting against him we knew that if we do anything to him 
his group would take revenge

a strong earthquake jolted west java 
destroying or damaging more than 150 homes and buildings and 
killing one villager officials said saturday eleven people were 
injured 
the quake friday measured 52 on the richter scale of ground 
motion and was centered in a mountainous area of majalengka about 
185 miles southeast of the capital said sutarjo a government 
meterology official in jakarta 
the death and injuries all occurred in the anggarwati area near 
the epicenter said majalengka district administrator djufri 
pringadi 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 55 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 45

a band of rogue bell ringers has been pealing 
under false pretenses in lincolnshire and vicars throughout 
england will be on the alert sunday for rats in their belfries 
six to eight bogus ringers have recently rung unsafe bells at 
four churches in the diocese of lincoln endangering themselves 
others and the bells according to church of england officials 
the rogues struck at st clements in worlaby and st andrews 
in bonby on the south bank of the humber and at two other 
churches that have not been identified similar incidents were 
reported in cambridgeshire earlier this year and a bell tower in a 
village church was damaged 
robin heppenstall secretary of the lincoln diocese guild of 
church bellringers said the pealers duped vicars and church 
wardens into allowing them into the towers where they rang bells 
long silent because of their dangerous condition 
it is conceivable that the clapper inside the bell could be 
worn and faulty and if it flies out it could go anywhere 
heppenstall said 
if that went out through a window it could conceivably injure 
someone seriously he warned 
it could be churches were thinking of spending a few hundred 
pounds to make the bell tower safe and the bells operational and 
then suddenly they are faced with a bigger bill he said 
the bells anchored on frames and weighing about 1000 pounds 
revolve 360 degrees 
if the frame is badly worn or eaten by woodworm and you start 
ringing there is considerable force the whole frame could collapse 
under the energy of the bell he said 
bell ringers require months of training heppenstall said 
ive seen people lifted several feet into the air because 
theyve lost control of the bell he said these tower grabbers 
are competent people they appear to have some knowledge of bell 
ringing 
each of the 5425 belfries in england provides a unique 
experience for ringers the size the weight the casting and the 
way the bell is hung contribute to a distinctive toll and feel 
they sound differently and you can go on a little outing and 
ring in different places but they have taken it to an extreme and 
are ringing where bells are not safe and obviously we are 
concerned heppenstall said 
anne carpenter assistant editor of ringing world a 
4500circulation weekly newspaper said there is a proper way to 
go about testing bells 
there are those who behave in a decent way and arrange proper 
outings to ring bells and have lunch that is a a perfectly 
civilized way of going about it ms carpenter said 
she said this was the first organized band of rogue bell ringers 
she has heard of since the distinctive english style of 
changeringing developed in the 17th century 
such knavery has sent ominous tintinnabulations echoing through 
the ringing fraternity 
if a vicar has been conned he wont be keen on bell ringers on 
the whole so if anyone asks can i have a ring on your bells he 
will say no ms carpenter said 
i like to visit fresh churches with my learners heppenstall 
said it would do them good to ring on bells that are a different 
weight and i like to take them on an outing but if i ring up a 
vicar he might say we dont have visitors here because of the rogue 
bell ringers so legitimate requests are refused

after just six months as virginias 
governor l douglas wilder is being hailed as a new national 
leader and hot democratic presidential prospect 
but at home the nations first black elected governor is coming 
under criticism for his travels unpaid bills and social life 
since becoming governor in january wilder has visited 11 
states including the early presidential sweepstakes states of new 
hampshire and iowa carrying his message of fiscal conservatism and 
social activism 
he criticizes the failures of the bush administration and tells 
audiences the same new mainstream that elected him governor 
should put a democrat in the white house he describes the 
qualities of the ideal nominee and says id like to think im one 
of those persons 
but wilder insists he has no plans to run for president 
the governor maintains that his travels and the attention he 
gets are helping virginia which has not been nationally prominent 
since colonial times 
its been a long time since virginias ever been considered at 
the national level he said its to virginias credit that the 
governor has been asked to travel 
i give virginia about 18 hours a day and thats seven days a 
week wilder told reporters last month 
but the governor has come under criticism for his busy travel 
schedule and most recently for his use of a state helicopter to 
take personal trips with patricia kluge estranged wife of 
americas richest man john w kluge 
the kluges who gave wilder his biggest campaign contribution of 
200000 separated two months ago the governor last winter 
appointed mrs kluge a former nude model and high school dropout 
to the board of visitors of the university of virginia 
were friends wilder told reporters last month and refused 
to elaborate a spokeswoman for mrs kluge gave a similar response 
friends and critics of the divorced governor agree his 
friendship with mrs kluge is a private matter 
but when the relationship somehow involves his use of state 
aircraft then to that extent it is a public matter the roanoke 
times amp worldnews said in an editorial 
some blacks say wilder has been targeted for criticism because 
of his race even whites admit he is being watched closely because 
of his unique place in american politics 
by the mere fact of who he is hes going to get some 
scrutiny thats acceptable jack gravely state president of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people said 
last week 
but he added many black folk that ive spoken to over the 
holiday have said theyve got barry now theyre going after 
doug referring to the ongoing trial of washingtons black 
mayor marion barry on drug and perjury charges 
an awful lot of white people are watching doug wilder closely 
and x percentage of them are hoping he will trip up said a 
white longtime observer of virginia politics who asked not to be 
identified 
wilders historic jan 13 swearingin ceremony still is making 
news with disclosures that his inaugural committee has yet to pay a 
148500 bill for printing the invitations 
the governor also has been criticized for refusing to reveal how 
he will use any profits from his inaugural ball lobbyists and 
corporations contributed an estimated 1 million to pay for the 
celebration 
meanwhile virginia has been having financial troubles of its 
own wilder has said he will announce spending cuts next month to 
cope with a projected 300 million budget shortfall over the next 
two years 
hes worked to cut back state services all the while 
establishing himself as the most extravagant governor in virginias 
history said joe elton executive director of the state 
republican party 
the governor also has drawn fire for ordering state agencies and 
institutions to sell stocks in companies doing substantial business 
in south africa teachers have worried about how the divestment 
would affect the states 11 billion employee pension fund 
the various criticisms are having some impact on his image 
instate said larry sabato a university of virginia political 
analyst eventually it will be part of the national evaluation 
of doug wilder the candidate for vice president or president 
while disavowing national ambitions wilder has shown no 
reluctance to address national and foreign policy issues he has 
asked president bush to appoint an independent commission to 
investigate the savings and loan bailout has expressed support for 
israel and has promised to visit the jewish state as well as saudi 
arabia next year 
at the same time he has shied away from some state issues such 
as whether taxsupported virginia military institute should be 
opened to women 
when the governor repeated last month that he has no opinion on 
vmis admissions policy he was met with groans and hoots from an 
audience of teenage girls attending a conference on state 
government 
his support among other constituents particularly blacks 
remains strong 
the overwhelmingly majority of the people in the community 
that i serve feel that the governor is doing a good job said the 
rev darrel rollins pastor of the 31st street baptist church in 
richmond

the united states and angola blame each other 
for a breakdown in efforts to mount a relief operation for hundreds 
of thousands of angolans who may face starvation 
a representative of the angolan government said he was worried 
that the bush administration could use relief deliveries as a cover 
for sending weapons to anticommunist rebels in angola 
us officials call that allegation nonsense and say the 
administration informed the angolan government some time ago that 
the us was willing to permit delivery of food shipments by the 
international committee of the red cross or another neutral relief 
organization 
the affected area is in southern angola and encompasses 
territory under the control of both sides in angolas 15year old 
civil war the government has received substantial aid from the 
soviet union over the years while the united states has been 
providing covert aid to the unita rebels since 1986 
the red cross estimates that some 250000 angolans are in 
immediate danger of starvation because of recent droughts and the 
internal conflict the lives of hundreds of thousands of others 
could be at risk in the coming weeks 
the administration favors an overland food delivery operation 
through a third country partly because airlifts are so costly the 
countries adjacent to the affected area are namibia and botswana 
robert b washington a washington lawyer whose firm represents 
the government of angola said in a letter this past week to 
congressmen that authorities in luanda strongly support food 
deliveries to angolans of all persuasions 
however he said the angolan government has concerns about food 
deliveries by aircraft or by truck from namibia or botswana 
we hope you can understand the reluctance of the angolan 
government to allow officials of the administration who have 
continued to support additional funding of lethal military aid to 
the unita rebels to oversee the movement of supplies over unknown 
boundaries into unitacontrolled territory washington told the 
congressmen in his letter 
a state department official who spoke only on condition that he 
not be identified said the united states has never proposed 
sending the food into angola unilaterally 
we dont know where they got that idea the official said 
washington sent his letter to the members of congress after 
unita leader jonas savimbi wrote to president bush and soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev asking them to consider a joint food 
airlift for angola 
savimbi also proposed that corridors of peace be created in 
angola through which international relief convoys could pass with 
guarantees of safe passage from rebel and government forces the 
bush administration supports that approach 
soviet and american officials have held discussions about a 
cooperative relief effort but no agreement has been reached 
the two countries agreed recently on a joint food airlift for 
ethiopia with us food to be flown on soviet planes

thousands of freedomhungry albanians 
crowding about a dozen embassies will be allowed to leave their 
hardline communist nation under foreign supervision a hungarian 
diplomat said today 
the diplomat who spoke from the albanian capital tirana on 
condition of anonymity said the logistics of the departure had not 
been worked out 
but he said ambassadors of embassies harboring up to 5000 
albanians had been told by foreign ministry officials their 
personnel could supervise the issuing of travel documents and 
accompany the emigres to their new homelands 
only people who have been accepted by another country will be 
allowed to leave the diplomat said in a telephone interview 
the reported breakthrough came just hours after albanian 
legislators guaranteed that the asylumseekers could leave the 
hardline communist nation without fear of punishment 
the rush on the embassies continued overnight and there 
reportedly were up to 5000 people in more than a dozen missions 
today 
about 10000 prodemocracy demonstrators gathered in a square 
near the embassies friday in the largest demonstration of its kind 
in 45 years of communist rule austrias apa news agency reported 
the silent rally dispersed after a brief clash between police and 
some demonstrators 
the albanian foreign ministry on thursday promised to grant 
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in a 
desperate attempt to flee their homeland which borders greece and 
yugoslavia 
but todays parliamentary decree published by the state news 
agency ata was the first pledge with the force of law that all 
albanians in the foreign missions could come out and receive 
passports without fear or prosecution 
a special central committee meeting to deal with the recent 
disorder continued into its third day today 
communist leader ramiz alia on friday criticized the thousands 
of asylum seekers and told the central committee that the party 
would not give up power as communists had done elsewhere in eastern 
europe 
the aims and actions of these destructive antidemocratic and 
antialbanian forces go too far alia said in remarks carried by 
albanias ata news agency we may be poor undoubtedly we have 
difficulties and shortages but the foreigner has never solved our 
troubles 
the apa report on the demonstration was sketchy but no injuries 
were reported the news agency has one of the few correspondents in 
albania 
meanwhile the embassies offering shelter to asylum seekers said 
sanitary conditions were nearly intolerable 
the number of refugees in the west germany embassy doubled to

albanian capital this week follows last years exodus of east 
germans to embassies in other east european countries shortly 
before the fall of their hardline government 
under 45 years of hardline communist rule travel for average 
albanians has been virtually impossible but under alia who took 
over after enver hoxhas death in 1985 the country pf 32 million 
people has increasingly sought ties abroad and has slowly begun to 
implement reforms

all albanians over age 16 to own a passport for foreign travel the 
passport regulations did not check the flow of asylumseekers 
most of the albanians who fled to foreign embassies before 
thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began monday under 
fire from albanian security forces diplomats said at least three 
people were wounded 
in recent months alia has begun to modify albanias stalinist 
economic and political systems he promised on friday to continue 
reforms but insisted that only the communist party could realize 
the genuine democracy the human rights the countrys progress and 
the defense of its freedom and independence 
alia promised a new election law but strongly implied it would 
not affect the communist partys monopoly on power

one two the drill master barked 
saturday one two the women of beijing universitys freshmen 
class barked back 
then arms swinging and faces stolid they goosestepped in 
unison across the parade ground of the shijiazhuang military 
academy 
this is how the first class to enter beijing university after 
last years democracy movement spent the school year learning to 
be good foot soldiers of the communist revolution 
their training reflects the chinese leaderships analysis of the 
root cause of the massive 1989 studentled protests weak 
ideological education its prescription for preventing further 
unrest is to intensify political training and discipline 
while older beijing university students passed the school year 
in glum cynicism after the violent quashing of the movement they 
helped lead the 728 freshmen spent 10 months training at 
shijiazhuang 
at the army school 170 miles south of beijing they learned to 
march salute shoot throw grenades and roll their bedding with 
military precision 
they also read the works of marx lenin and chinese 
revolutionary leader mao tsetung and were lectured on the error 
of the 1989 protests which ended in an army attack that left at 
least 300 people dead 
officials on saturday showed the freshmen off to foreign 
journalists allowed for the first time to visit them 10 days 
before the program ends the class now faces four years of regular 
coursework in beijing 
this experiment has been successful so far said beijing 
university president wu shuqing 
he said the next freshman class which will number 1600 will 
undergo the same program this years class was reduced drastically 
from the average 2000 so the academy could accommodate it 
it has toughened their confidence in socialism and invigorated 
their determination to build a strong china said the academys 
political commissar maj gen xiang xu 
a video prepared by the academy described the years training as 
a powerful formative and bonding experience much like that 
undergone by army recruits anywhere who have their egos broken down 
to be rebuilt in a military image 
we were critical stubborn and sometimes naughty said an 
unidentified woman student who narrated the video but gradually 
we were acclimatized and became part of the academy 
we have never learned so much in one year she said what 
we have gained will comfort us for the rest of our life 
most chinese high school and college students receive brief 
military training usually a few weeks of marching drills on campus 
and a compulsory course in military history that is as close as 
most intellectuals get to soldiers whom they tend to look down on 
because most are poorly educated peasants 
political study also is mandatory at all levels of school but 
in recent years many college students skipped political classes or 
paid little attention 
at shijiazhuang the freshmen knew their lessons 
military training was a great good fortune said 20yearold 
han tao unit leader in his 12bunk dormitory room explaining why 
he didnt mind spending five years at college instead of four 
his roommate jiang qinjun said he might make friends with an 
upperclassman who took part in the 1989 protests but we cant 
support their participation in the marches if someone has an 
incorrect understanding we should educate them 
the key question is how long the academys influence will last 
once the freshmen are exposed to beijing universitys far 
lessdisciplined atmosphere some upperclassmen have said privately 
they plan to reeducate the freshmen in politics and a 
morerelaxed lifestyle 
at the military academy the freshmen have followed a strict 
regimen up at 6 am and in bed at 10 pm after a day of 
exercise and study no drinking and no romantic relationships are 
allowed 
the students wear standard army uniforms and the womens hair 
is clipped to chin length or shorter many jumped to attention when 
approached by journalists 
xiang said the students could be relied on to rise in defense 
of the state and the people if china faced foreign aggression 
wouldnt it be ironic journalists asked if some of the 
freshmen put their new military skills to use during a future round 
of student protests 
i am confident my students will not do that xiang said of 
course he said there are always a few individual scum 
exceptional cases

the state plans to resume aerial spraying of 
the pesticide malathion to eradicate mediterranean fruit flies this 
week despite a study that says the material contains toxic heavy 
metals 
state officials say their tests show theres no threat to public 
health 
helicopters will spray a 14squaremile area of los angeles on 
thursday state officials said friday the spraying was scheduled 
for last week but was delayed after city attorneys presented the 
findings of their analysis 
the mediterranean fruit fly also called the medfly can destroy 
hundreds of varieties of fruits and vegetables and is considered a 
serious threat to the states multibilliondollar agriculture 
economy 
a study released by city councilman joel wachs found that 
samples of malathion contained excessive levels of lead nickel and 
chromium wachs said the presence of the metals violated strict 
state limits on toxic substances and said he would seek a temporary 
restraining order against the spraying monday 
truesdail laboratories in tustin calif conducted the 
independent analysis of malathion for the city of los angeles 
but state tests of the same samples found no dangerous levels of 
heavy metals state officials countered 
the numbers our lab got are very low in fact lower than that 
in plain old soil said james w stratton who headed the state 
department of health services review of the pesticide 
the department of health services has completed its latest 
test and like all previous tests has determined that our malathion 
spraying program poses no public health risk said henry j voss 
state agriculture director 
the downtown spraying was ordered after a single female medfly 
was found near dodger stadium 
malathion was last sprayed in southern california on june 26 in 
riverside and san bernardino counties 
the state also plans to release millions of sterilized male 
medflies in an effort to interfere with reproduction

its usually the pretrial publicity that 
lawyers worry about but little could rival the circuslike 
aftermath of trial that cleared a 19yearold woman of being an 
accomplice to her mothers murder 
the hartford prosecutors office has been besieged by angry 
phone calls after the june 28 verdict mostly from people who want 
to see karin aparo behind bars along with her former lover her 
alleged accomplice 
ive never ever ever seen anything like it said an 
employee in the office of hartford states attorney john m bailey 
who spoke on condition of anonymity weve never had people call 
this office and be so outraged 
ms aparos aunt her dead mothers sister has launched a 
publicity campaign to counter what she calls the lust for blood 
among those who believe ms aparo was responsible for the 1987 
death of her 47yearold mother joyce aparo 
though cleared of being an accomplice to murder ms aparo could 
still face a retrial on a less serious charge of conspiracy in 
which the jury could not reach a verdict 
dennis coleman the former boyfriend added to the trials 
bizarre conclusion when he gave a jailhouse interview to more than 
a dozen reporters last week to denounce the verdict he charged 
jurors were taken in by ms aparos tears 
ms aparo who shared a condominium with her mother in the 
welltodo hartford suburb of glastonbury was accused of hatching 
a plan when she was 15 to do away with her overbearing mother 
prosecutors charged she recruited her lovestruck boyfriend to do 
the deed as coleman now 22 referred to the alleged plot 
coleman who confessed and is serving a 34year sentence 
testified that his passion for ms aparo went beyond obsession 
the defense successfully portrayed ms aparo as an abused child 
who fantasized about her mothers death but didnt enlist coleman 
to act on her fantasies instead the defense said coleman broke 
in while karin was away and strangled mrs aparo as she slept 
because he believed she was encouraging her daughter to sleep with 
another man the 24yearold son of karins violin teacher 
the fourweek trial fixated connecticut residents with details 
about what coleman described as the teenage couples active and 
liberal sex life including bondage with handcuffs and pantyhose 
there was also bizarre testimony that mrs aparo psychologically 
abused her daughter even insinuating her real father was 
hartfords roman catholic archbishop a family friend michael 
aparo and joyce aparo were divorced when karin was 5 
the jury found ms aparo innocent of being an accessory to her 
mothers 1987 murder but deadlocked 75 in favor of acquittal on 
the conspiracy charge 
by thursday the prosecutors office had logged more than 150 
calls all but a handful from people who want to see ms aparo 
retried on the second charge 
the journal inquirer a newspaper that has covered the trial 
closely added its voice to the chorus urging a second trial 
suggesting that everyone who believed ms aparo was innocent might 
fit into one room lucky for karin it was the jury room in 
hartford superior court an editorial said 
a number of callers were upset by the behavior of jury foreman 
richard meister who winked at ms aparo before the verdict was 
announced and was later shown on television hugging her outside the 
courthouse and stroking her hair 
meister said he justed wanted to spare ms aparo a few seconds 
of agony before the verdict was announced but some people 
interpreted the wink as inappropriate intimacy 
one irate aparowatcher called baileys office and charged the 
jury made up of four women and eight men found aparo innocent 
by reason of an advanced case of the hots 
ina camblor ms aparos aunt calls the public response 
lunacy and complains that those who are unhappy with the 
verdict dont want justice they want blood 
shes asking those who share her feelings to write bailey and 
gov william a oneill to urge that the state drop the remaining 
charge against her niece so far about 30 people have done so she 
said 
ms aparos defense attorney hubert santos filed motions 
tuesday to dismiss the remaining charge arguing that a lynchmob 
atmosphere in connecticut makes a fair second trial impossible 
bailey says he wont decide whether to retry ms aparo for a few 
weeks to give himself time to step back from the emotions of the 
case

the rhetoric swirled through the marble 
corridors of the capitol republicans and democrats alike hauled 
out their most colorful cataclysmic language and vowed a battle 
royal should anyone dare to raise taxes 
all the while in a room across the hall from the senate 
chamber the men who actually might decide if taxes would be raised 
hunkered down and got to work 
it was kind of like being in the eye of a storm said senate 
budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn one of those in 
the quiet bargaining room 
the issue that day last month was taxes after president bush 
abandoned his staunch antitax stance but the scene is the same 
every day that negotiators for the white house and congress try to 
shrink the federal deficit while their colleagues play the issues 
for all their political worth 
the negotiators ability to seek compromise while the rest of 
the capitol rings with partisan clamor reflects two overriding 
factors their perspective about the task theyve been assigned and 
the personalities of the people involved 
the bargainers must look at the federal budget from exactly the 
opposite perspective that most members of congress usually have 
the negotiators are looking for 50 billion in new taxes and 
spending cuts for next year and about 500 billion over the next 
five years a search that entails nothing but thorny choices 
they know that if they fail the grammrudman balancedbudget 
law will automatically cut tens of billions of dollars from most 
programs this fall 
most lawmakers on the other hand see their jobs as a constant 
battle to bring federal dollars back home and to protect their 
districts from pain 
these people sitting around the table are staring the deficit 
problem in the face said rep charles schumer dny a member 
of the house budget committee who is not one of the negotiators 
members of congress are staring their constituents in the face 
participants in the talks are aware of this dichotomy and say 
that reacting to it is a crucial part of their job 
if we dont keep our lines of communication open to those 
members and make sure they have input we may come down from the 
mountaintop with an agreement that nobody is prepared to vote 
for said one of the bargainers house budget committee chairman 
leon panetta dcalif 
the talks have been moving slowly for two months but 
participants say the negotiating has gotten more serious since 
bushs reversal on his tax position 
bargainers would like to complete a deal on a package before the 
beginning of the august congressional recess negotiations resume 
tuesday 
another reason for the negotiators singlemindedness is the 
personality and political instincts of many of the people in the 
bargaining room and their bosses 
by historical accident many of the key figures are moderate 
consensusbuilding politicians who believe that compromise is what 
effective governing is all about 
bush house speaker thomas s foley dwash and senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine all fit that mold 
president ronald reagan and former house speaker jim wright 
dtexas did not 
theres no jim wright in there said rep vin weber 
rminn one of the houses most conservative members there 
isnt even a tip oneill the massachusetts democrat who as 
speaker was a persistent liberal champion during the reagan years 
ideologues are few among the negotiators with the best examples 
being the staunchly antitax sen phil gramm rtexas no 2 house 
republican newt gingrich of georgia and the white house chief of 
staff john sununu 
sasser a former chairman of his states democratic party and 
no 3 house democratic leader william h gray of pennsylvania are 
perhaps the most partisan of the democratic bargainers 
the bargaining teams are loaded with lawmakers who have been 
through the budget wars before and who seem inclined to compromise 
to deal with the deficit these include panetta sen pete 
domenici rnm rep bill frenzel rminn and the white house 
budget director richard darman 
youre dealing with people said rep tim penny dminn 
who really are willing to give a little bit of their own agenda 
to achieve the goal of deficit reduction

when george and barbara bush called houston home 
they often stopped by a nofrills texmex restaurant on the poor 
side of town and dined on beef fajitas and spicy green sauce 
they also frequented patterson hardware like other weekend home 
warriors picking up tools to fix their twostory pink brick house 
and to putter in the garden 
the bushes visit houston only infrequently now and the nations 
first couple calls a houstonian hotel suite their home away from 
home but local folks still have fond memories of them 
theyre beautiful people theyve always been very 
downtoearth says ninfa laurenzo owner of the chain of ninfas 
restaurants which specialize in texmex fare 
i think hes going to be very busy laurenzo says when asked 
if he thinks the president might visit his old haunt he has a 
pretty full agenda but theres always a chance hell stop by 
in fact the tight summit schedule doesnt include any stop at 
bushs old favorites but the president is known for his 
spontaneity one time his motorcade paid a surprise visit to 
molinas another texmex restaurant where bush is fond of the 
tejas enchiladas 
a few miles from the houstonian is hunan an elegant chinese 
restaurant and another bush favorite on new years the first 
couple even ordered some takeout from the restaurant that was 
delivered to their suite at the houstonian 
manager gigi huang whose father owns hunan said she hasnt 
been informed of any presidential visit like mrs laurenzo she 
says any visit will be last minute 
george and barbara bush have been dining with us for about the 
past 12 years she said when they lived in houston we would 
see them about once a week or every other week 
he really enjoys the people and mrs bush is very friendly 
and downtoearth she said shes very real we always enjoy 
seeing them 
when they had some household chores to do they went to 
patterson hardware where owner bill collins remembers them as 
just plain customers like everybody else they owned a home and 
they did their own upkeep they werent afraid to get their hands 
dirty 
despite the dilapidated surroundings the festive ninfas with 
its colorful decor attracts an affluent but casual crowd hungry for 
the traditional southofthe border fare 
the area is strikingly different from the manicured lawns and 
sprawling brick homes of tanglewood an expensive neighborhood in 
west houston where the bushes lived after the he moved his oil 
company to the city 
thenoilman bush moved his family from midland texas to houston 
some 31 years ago he became harris county chairman republican 
chairman in 1962 ran unsuccessfully for the us senate in 1964 
won a seat in congress in 1966 he sold his 6 percent stake in 
zapata petroleum at the time for 11 million 
the bushes also remain members of st martins episcopal church 
a brown brick church in tanglewood the rev edward stein said bush 
has been to services at st martins about three times since being 
elected president in 1988

world leaders will focus on global warming and 
the destruction of rain forests at the economic summit but they 
are unlikely to do enough to satisfy environmentalists 
president bush and his six summit partners are expected to sign 
a communique outlining how they will cooperate on international 
environmental issues 
several environmental groups who will be on hand with an 
environmental scorecard to grade the summit are skeptical 
about what the leaders of the industrial nations will accomplish 
the people of the world want more than just communiques that 
sound environmental they want policies that are environmentally 
sound said fred krupp executive director of the environmental 
defense fund 
global warming the socalled greenhouse effect has emerged 
as a thorny international environmental issue scientists say 
gaseous emissions trap solar heat causing a gradual warming of the 
earth 
while several european nations already have plans to reduce or 
stabilize carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 of 2005 bush 
contends more research is needed on global warming before such 
dramatic steps need be taken 
in advance of the summit us officials said participants are 
expected to agree on the outlines of an international convention 
to be held by 1992 to discuss global warming 
but the officials speaking on condition they remain anonymous 
said they appear to have avoided what could have been a bruising 
battle at the summit with european nations over the reduction of 
gaseous emissions 
the officials said the europeans seem to be willing to back away 
from their previous insistence that specific reduction goals be set 
at the summit led by germany some countries had sought a 
commitment to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions or reduce them by 
up to 25 percent by the end of the decade 
there is still wrangling however over when the nations should 
begin work on agreements to formally spell out how they will fight 
global warming administration officials said 
two other contentious areas involve curtailing the destruction 
of tropical forests and setting up an international green fund 
to help developing countries protect their environments 
the united states is not anxious to sign any agreements curbing 
the destruction of tropical forests but one official said im 
not going to throw down my body in front of a train if others 
nations devise a plan 
the summiteers are expected to agree on strengthening the 
tropical forestry action plan that was conceived in the mid1980s 
by the world bank and other international organizations 
the plan channels international investment into tropical 
countries to help them develop land use policies that will help 
save forests 
the plans critics say so far the projects selected to receive 
money ignore forestry protection goals there is a general feeling 
among the summit partners that a tougher plan is needed one us 
official said 
meantime the world bank is viewed as the most likely vehicle to 
administer a green fund to provide money for developing 
nations environmental projects 
but the bush administration will oppose a separately financed 
green fund at the world bank which lends money to poor 
countries for various projects one administration official said 
the united states would probably go along with a green fund if 
it were paid for out of existing resources a position some 
europeans would oppose 
bush in an attempt to blunt any criticism of the united states 
as reticent on global warming or other issues intends to tell his 
summit partners at tuesdays environmental session about recent 
us environmental accomplishments 
officials say he will recite a series of steps that when 
combined according to administration projections would stabilize 
or even reduce carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the decade 
they include the clean air act still pending in congress 
bushs plan to plant 1 billion trees a year and purchase wilderness 
areas and the us commitment to the elimination of 
ozonedepleting chemicals by the year 2000 
the economic summit communique is likely to include endorsement 
of the recent 93nation agreement in london to wipe out 
chlorofluorocarbons chemicals that deplete the earths protective 
ozone layer by the end of the decade

the communist party chief says the leaders of the 
seven industrialized powers should avoid meddling in chinas 
internal affairs at their annual economic summit in houston this 
week 
jiang zemin said the group of seven should confine themselves 
to discussion of economic and other issues among themselves the 
official xinhua news agency said in a report saturday that 
paraphrased his remarks 
jiang was interviewed friday by noboru watanabe president of 
the japanese mainichi newspaper group 
during the twohour interview jiang also disclosed that the 
party has been unable to resolve the case of former party chief 
zhao ziyang zhao was stripped of all his posts in june 1989 for 
supporting a studentled prodemocracy movement but he has not 
been brought to trial 
during their threeday summit the leaders of the seven 
industrialized nations are expected to discuss lifting economic 
sanctions they imposed on china after its brutal suppression of 
last years prodemocracy movement 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan will push for ending the 
economic sanctions imposed on china but his bid to unfreeze 52 
billion worth of development loans is opposed by other summit 
countries 
besides japan the summit participants include the united 
states canada britain west germany italy and france 
some western countries are very unwise to have imposed 
economic sanctions on china as this will bring about no positive 
result but will instead arouse the chinese peoples resentment 
jiang said 
many chinese citizens initially welcomed the sanctions saying 
the government should be punished in some way for killing hundreds 
perhaps thousands of people to crush the democracy movement 
however there have been more appeals recently for lifting of 
the sanctions which some say are beginning to hurt the chinese 
people 
japan the only asian member of the group of seven already has 
eased its ban on loans to china granting two loans last week for 
16 million to be used to improve drinking water 
japan acted after china lifted martial law in beijing released 
nearly 900 people arrested for joining the democracy movement and 
allowed dissident fang lizhi to leave the us embassy and go into 
exile in england 
if the western nations interfere in the affairs of other 
countries i am afraid that would not be proper jiang said 
his remarks contrasted with a foreign ministry statement last 
week urging the group of seven to take timely positive steps by 
seizing the opportunity to improve relations with china 
jiang was also asked about zhao who has not been seen in public 
for more than 13 months 
he is still a party member and no change has been made in his 
treatment in terms of material wellbeing jiang said chinese 
leaders had previously said zhao was living in his home and 
continuing to draw his regular salary 
in the weeks after zhaos purge party leaders hinted strongly 
that he would face criminal charges for supporting the democracy 
movement which china considers a counterrevolutionary rebellion 
but jiangs disclosure that the case was still under 
investigation suggests that a strong reform element still exists 
within the party

welcome to the lesperance home where 
kids will be kids will be kids will be kids will be kids and 
thats just the quintuplets the nations first testtube set 
besides the 2yearold quints michele and raymond lesperance 
have three sons from previous marriages and now are caring for 
three nieces at their home about 30 miles north of detroit thats 
11 kids if youre counting 
it hasnt been easy food costs 350 weekly the telephone was 
briefly cut off last month for nonpayment the couple worried 
their electricity was next and handed their limousine the only 
vehicle that could carry all the kids back to the finance company 
raymond 29 is a macomb county jail guard bringing in 26000 
yearly his wife 36 works at a shelter for battered women 
recent publicity over the couples tight finances upset the 
family mrs lesperance said she says they can care for their 
children but needed a fosterhome license and the increased 
state aid it would bring to care for her sisters brood 
why take them from family she said in a terse interview 
outside the familys twostory colonial home as she held one of 
the two horses they keep on their 10acre spread 
oakland county probate judge barry grant was angered at a 
hearing last week on the license requested five weeks ago he 
ordered the state department of social services to explain why it 
hasnt acted on the couples request to waive rules that normally 
exclude a family with eight or more children from being a foster 
home 
this is government bureaucracy at its worst grant said 
chuck peller a spokesman for the department said the 
fosterhome license decision was delayed because the family only 
recently filled out the needed paperwork 
as foster parents the lesperances would receive about 1000 
monthly for their nieces rather than 295 in welfare they now get 
the lesperances told grant that private donations will let them 
keep their nieces regardless of the governments decision outside 
court they wont talk about money id rather let sleeping dogs 
lie mrs lesperance said 
the couple apparently once expected that commercial endorsements 
would offset the sudden costs of erica veronica danielle 
alexandria and raymond jr born 10 weeks premature in january 1988 
no endorsements occurred multiple births had become a lot 
more common said attorney thomas plunkett who was hired to 
negotiate contracts even being the countrys first quints 
conceived through invitro fertilization didnt land offers he 
said 
there were donations limousine rides from the hospital cribs 
clothing and toys and gerber products co still pays for any food

some victims of last months deadly flash 
flooding in villages off the west bank of the ohio river are 
struggling to cope with the bureaucracy and confusion of relief 
organizations 
most of the attention has been focused on the wegee and pipe 
creek communities south of this belmont county village on the 
night of june 14 at least 26 people died when flash floods 
rampaged down wegee and pipe creeks 
but residents of several smaller villages dillonvale adena 
newtown rayland mount pleasant and connorville just to the 
north in jefferson county suffered as well when short creek and 
its tributaries went out of control the same night 
dillonvale mayor leon bailey said his valley suffered far more 
damage than wegee and pipe creek although with no deaths and 
fears rural jefferson county is being shortchanged because of the 
attention given shadyside 
the american red cross said it has issued 180600 in vouchers 
to belmont county residents and 207400 in vouchers in jefferson 
county red cross spokesman doug skroback said jefferson county 
reported almost twice as many houses damaged as did belmont county 
the federal emergency management agency the small business 
administration and the ohio emergency management agency are making 
grants and loans as specific problems and costs are identified and 
applications approved 
fema reports 3059 registrations for help from the ohio counties 
that were declared a federal disaster area as a result of recent 
severe weather it has disbursed 11 million in disaster housing 
aid statewide and paid 600000 in individual and family grants 
marion s szypkowski 76 and his wife nancy were evacuated 
from their dillonvale home by rowboat with little more than their 
nightclothes water from short creek caved in the front wall of 
their basement making their home unsafe they moved in with a 
friend but so far no one else has offered any help 
i filled out an application for fema a week ago said mrs 
szypkowski i turned it in at the church like they said and ive 
called that 800 number several times that they gave me but they 
havent got it yet 
i cant afford a loan szypkowski said adding that his only 
income is from social security he has estimates of 800 to 1100 
labor costs to rebuild his basement wall plus the cost of 
materials 
fema officials held a town meeting last week to explain to 
dillonvale residents how the agency makes cash grants for 
relocation or immediate repairs to dwellings 
rob svoboda walked out of the meeting after heatedly asking why 
some people are charged 8 percent for loans and others get grants 
or lower interest loans 
i applied to fema and i made out well but those on fixed 
income are getting stuck said svoboda 26 an electronics 
technician at a steel mill 
village leaders in shadyside dillonvale and adena have 
organized to accept and distribute money and materials donated to 
help flood victims 
the rev david baker president of the shadyside fellowship of 
churches says more than 300000 has been donated to the shadyside 
relief fund inc 
baker hopes fund managers can start distributing the money by 
midjuly he expects the fund will aid about 115 households hardest 
hit by the flood 
getting the organization set up and running properly is taking 
longer than expected said baker pastor of united methodist 
church attorneys accountants and other specialists are donating 
their expertise to be certain the distribution is properly handled 
adena a dozen miles up short creek has a little more than 
5000 in its local relief fund but chet masloski whose wife is 
coordinating the fund said the town has 153 damaged houses 
any of those we can help wont get much he said

on inauguration day president 
fernando collor de mello promised a better life in 100 days but 
recession looms strikes abound and grumbling has begun about his 
antiinflation shock therapy 
their flamboyant new president stunned the 150 million 
brazilians in march by freezing bank accounts as part of his 
drastic program of bringing down annual inflation of nearly 5000 
percent 
he was immensely popular at first but that is changing 
the shock was cruel monstrous and unnecessary paul singer 
an economics professor and planning secretary for the city of sao 
paulo said in an interview 
collor 40 is brazils first freely elected president since 
1961 he took office march 15 promising a new brazil and 
reform of the bloated corrupt bureaucracy 
he said the first task was to reduce inflation drastically and 
eliminate a 31 billion budget deficit 
on march 16 he announced an 18month freeze on 80 percent of 
the money in savings accounts and financial markets price 
controls a new currency and an end to numbered bank accounts 
police made showcase arrests of bank and supermarket managers 
accused of not complying with the plan cheering crowds gathered as 
the executives were taken away they were released later 
to set an example of austerity collor abolished half the 24 
government ministries and ordered the sale of 42 governmentowned 
mansions and 10177 apartments formerly used by top officials 
rentfree 
thousands of official cars were auctioned in lots with signs 
proclaiming the end of perks 
dozens of the 188 stateowned companies were put up for sale 
import taxes and trade barriers for thousands of imports were 
lowered or dropped 
automatic costofliving pay raises were eliminated collor said 
360000 of the governments 14 million employees would be fired by 
june 18 
official inflation fell from 84 percent a month in march to 33 
percent in april and the government said it soon would be zero 
brazilians were elated 
the collor government can be accused of almost anything in 
these first 100 days except indolence sluggishness or monotony 
the newspaper o estado de sao paulo said in an editorial called a 
hundred days that shook the country 
collors style appealed to the poor majority of brazilians who 
provided his main election support 
he personally checked prices at a supermarket and opened a 100 
bank account to encourage saving he tested an army tank flew an 
f5e jet fighter toured a remote amazon indian reservation in 
combat fatigues spent weekends riding jetskis and motorcycles 
jogging bicycling and kayaking 
a poll in may gave him a 74 percent approval rating 
his economic plan soon ran into trouble however the freeze on 
accounts slowed the economy to a crawl sales plummeted companies 
began laying off workers and the country slid toward recession 
in sao paulo brazils largest city and its financial center 
47447 workers were fired in may alone the highest onemonth total 
since 1981 unemployment in sao paulo rose to a record 12 percent 
it was a case of killing the cow to get rid of a tick said 
leonel brizola a former governor of rio de janeiro state who ran 
against collor for president 
unions said inflation was much higher than the government 
admitted their figures ranged up to 44 percent a month 
collors announced plans for layoffs led to strikes at 
government companies that run the docks railroads and oil industry 
inflation refused to go away prices rose 8 percent in may and 
nearly 10 percent in june according to official figures 
it was an error for the government to talk about zero 
inflation said sen roberto campos a former planning minister 
inflation of 7 or 8 a month is great progress but the goal 
became too ambitious 
opponents were nettled by collors habit of enacting key reforms 
by decree then sending them to the congress for approval many 
likened that to the decreelaws of the military governmnts of 
19641985 
when legislators prepared to vote on the economic plan collor 
told them not to meddle with it 
he tries to act like a prince of the brazilian aristocracy 
brizola said its been 100 days of impositions 
the target of 360000 layoffs by june 18 was not reached some 
critics even questioned the governments claim that 90000 were 
fired retired or sent home with pay one estimate put the figure 
at 41000 
theres more smoke than fire david fleischer a professor 
of political science at the university of brasilia said in an 
interview the popularity of the plan is sustained by imagery and 
the use of television when the government gets in trouble collor 
goes on tv hes very skillful 
a supreme court ruling that some reforms were unconstitutional 
did not help the governments credibility new bank deposits by 
small savers declined and businessmen found ways to unblock 
their frozen assets 
fleischer said the plan destroyed the faith of people in the 
savings account system which took 15 or 20 years to build up the 
government was naive 
a poll taken in june said only 36 percent of those rated 
collors performance good or excellent job 43 percent said average 
and 19 percent classed it as bad or terrible 
his press spokesman claudio humberto rosa e silva said the 
president was misunderstood 
everything that was promised is being done he said in an 
interview the layoffs of govenment employees were not intended to 
be finished by june 18 he said but will reach or exceed 360000 
by 1994

when helmut kohl received an honorary 
doctorate at harvard university a month ago the west german 
chancellor was lauded as a german hercules for his role at the 
head of one of the worlds richest nations 
the comparison may be apt kohl is a strong position to become 
the first chancellor of a united germany and as military might 
recedes as a measure of world power germany is certain to expand 
its international influence as an economic giant 
kohl has not been shy about wielding his influence he has 
bluntly called the 1990s the decade of the europeans 
he has become a champion of economic aid for the soviet union a 
message he will take to the economic summit in houston after 
raising the issue at the justended nato meeting in london 
in hungary poland and czechoslovakia the chancellor notes 
approvingly there is already talk of applying for membership in 
the european community following the collapse of communism 
for kohl the greater the steps toward full european 
integration the greater the chances for stability that will extend 
the continents longest period without war in centuries 
the conservative christian democrat 60 has been in office 
nearly eight years still he retains many of the folksy touches 
that appeal to the solid conservative majority at home and a 
similar bloc of voters in east germany 
during the nato summit kohl sat and regaled reporters for more 
than an hour late one night mixing a keen sense of history humor 
and frequent stinging barbs at the politicians he has known over 
the years 
diplomatically kohl strictly banned any repeat of those 
comments but his closing news conference on friday brought out 
several quips 
asked the reason for his close ties with us president george 
bush the chancellor said well right off i could say its 
because we are such good politicians thats the first answer that 
comes to mind 
of course thats not the answer ill give but i naturally 
like it when people say and write that the chancellor added with 
a smile 
instead kohl said of his relationship with bush the 
chemistry is right as you say in the united states 
when asked about an apparent rift in east berlin over nato 
membership for a united germany kohl said such the dispute was a 
specialty of the east german government he quickly added that 
occasional disagreements are hallmarks of democratically elected 
governments 
a man of huge dimensions 6feet3inches tall and 235 pounds 
kohl towers over most of his european counterparts 
two of those leaders 64yearold british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and french president francois mitterrand often 
bicker predictably at european summits 
that has left kohl in charge of much of the ecs direction 
guiding the communitys integration on a parallel track with german 
unification 
the twofold strategy is important for a country still acutely 
aware of international wariness of a powerful germany after the 
catastrophic experiences of two world wars 
we have learned the lessons of history kohl told the bush 
and the 14 other nato leaders echoing a statement he has made time 
and again 
kohl once infuriated jews by referring to the mercy of those 
born later which jewish leaders interpreted as an attempt on the 
part of younger germans to wash their hands of the holocaust 
despite that and other occasional gaffes the chancellor has 
held on to power during some of the most tumultuous years in his 
countrys nearly 41year history 
they include the massive resistance to the installation of 
mediumrange nuclear missiles in west germany in 1983 and the east 
german unrest that broke down the berlin wall last november 
earlier this year there were predictions that kohl could get 
hit by an antiunification backlash among west germans tired of 
seeing their country awash in handoutseeking east germans 
however two recent public opinion polls indicate that kohl has 
regained the momentum in his bid to become the first chancellor of 
a united germany after joint elections expected in december 
a poll conducted by the respected infas institute and released 
friday said kohl enjoys a 56 percent approval rating compared with 
37 percent for his social democratic challenger oskar lafontaine 
the spd and others have criticized kohl saying he has been 
pushing forward with unification too quickly at the risk of 
creating instability in east germany

a federal judge has awarded 3000 to a 
filmmaker who sued talk show host geraldo rivera for broadcasting 
part of his documentary on mass murderer charles manson without 
permission 
robert hendrickson claimed victory even though us district 
judge ronald sw lew awarded him far less than the 310000 he was 
seeking from rivera 
its all exclusive film thats what the court has ruled 
said hendrickson 45 i won the copyright issue against the best 
copyright lawyers in beverly hills i think thats something 
hendrickson who acted as his own attorney in the case filed 
his suit in may 1989 a month after rivera aired excerpts from the 
1972 documentary manson in a televised special called murder 
live from death row 
riveras attorneys argued that riveras production company 
investigative news group of new york had paid a video distributor 
3000 to use the excerpts hendrickson said the deal was made 
without his permission 
tribune entertainment and ktlatv which aired the rivera 
special also were named in the suit 
lew ruled thursday that investigative news group did infringe on 
a copyright on the documentary but he dismissed most of 
hendricksons damages claim including 42000 the filmmaker said 
rivera should have paid him to use the footage 
the judge ordered investigative news group tribune 
entertainment and ktlatv to jointly pay the award 
actress sharon tate and four others were murdered at her 
benedict canyon home on aug 9 1969 wealthy market owner leno 
labianca and his wife rosemary were killed at their los feliz

the nations largest teachers union 
issued a report saturday calling for a gradual end to the 
controversial practice of grouping students according to past 
performance 
robert chase vice president of the national education 
association said it would be foolhardy and unrealistic to expect 
that tracking can be eliminated overnight but said the union 
will offer strategies to better arrange class groupings 
academic tracking has become a hot educational issue as us 
students continue to test poorly in basic subjects opponents 
complain that minorities are too often placed into low ability and 
special education classes proponents argue tracking is needed so 
high achievers can move rapidly 
we must give students an education that will open up their 
options for the future not close them said chase at a news 
conference at the annual convention of the union representing 2 
million educators 
chase pointed to a carnegie study issued two years ago that 
found 63 percent of all us teachers considered tracking useful 
the report based on a commissioned johns hopkins university 
study said students can benefit from tracking but only under very 
specific conditions 
sue hovey of moscow idaho who worked on the nea report said 
students should be grouped only for specific skills like reading 
rather than by general ability also group assignments should be 
frequently reassessed 
the report said most schools track students by segregating them 
all or most of the day according to general achievement or 
behavior rather than by abilities in specific subjects 
the study found that groupings in elementary and secondary 
schools are hard to break out of and are likely to create racially 
identifiable classes 
leon horne an nea executive committee member who chaired the 
task force handling the report said the study also found that 
minorities are significantly underrepresented in classes that are 
prerequisites to higher level courses 
without these courses horne said many students are prevented 
from pursuing careers in advanced fields like science and 
engineering 
two years ago the union proposed and debated a resolution 
calling for an end to academic tracking based on socioeconomic 
status race or sex saturdays report came from a task force 
appointed then to study the issue further

this one was supposed to be different according 
to traditionalists and reformers alike the 28th congress of the 
soviet communist party would be a bitter struggle for the future of 
the party 
but halfway through their agenda the nearly 4700 delegates 
meeting in the kremlin have been able to do little more than erect 
a facade of unity on a foundation of words rather than action 
the most powerful assembly of the most powerful organization in 
soviet society appears dispirited and near ideological bankruptcy 
in the words of politburo member alexander n yakovlev the 
party of the revolutionary idea has turned into the party of 
power 
soviet society taking advantage of the changes under mikhail s 
gorbachev will pursue reforms no matter what course the party 
chooses yakovlev said 
but the new ideas however modest are being rejected by the 
congress 
rankandfile delegates are confused new faces are certain to 
appear in the party leadership but it is far from certain that 
personnel changes will be enough to bolster the partys sagging 
authority 
the congress sharpened the rhetoric soviets first heard at a 
party conference two years ago and at the governmental congress of 
peoples deputies last year 
then it was breath of freedom to watch the verbal duels between 
reformer boris n yeltsin and more traditional yegor k ligachev 
live broadcasts were curtailed because people were watching instead 
of working 
in march looking ahead to the congress ligachev said it would 
mean the fixing of boundaries and the cleansing from the party 
of all those who are destroying it who are engaging in a 
factional opposition struggle and who are participating in 
antisocialist movements 
on friday yeltsin warned that the party could not simply 
discard those ligachev considered troublemakers he said they would 
demand their share of the partys property or that the property be 
nationalized 
just has he has for years gorbachev continued to steer a middle 
course successfully avoiding the open split that had been promised 
by radical delegates consolidation was one of the congress 
buzzwords but it seemed to apply to preserving the party rather 
than forging new policies 
delegates seemed subdued rather than energized by months of 
buildup the lack of anything new drove some party members to 
despair 
on the opening day of the congress rafael belyalov a composer 
and party official in the city of kazan announced he was quitting 
the party 
i did not wait until the end of the 28th congress since i was 
sure that nothing is changing the postfactum news service quoted 
him as saying 
delegate yuri boldyrev from leningrad urged nationalization of 
the partys property on the first day of the congress and said 57 
percent of the active party constituents in his district agreed 
with him 
but he said 40 percent of the district party members did not 
bother to take part in elections to the congress apparently out of 
apathy 
for me nothing has been explained nothing is happening just 
as we predicted said vyacheslav shostakovsky a leader of the 
democratic platform reform group group members decided to quit the 
party and ask for a share of its assets after the congress 
the modest new ideas presented at the congress have been shot 
down 
gorbachev lost a bid to rename the party leaders post chairman 
rather than general secretary and add two deputies he said it was 
more likely that the congress would add one deputy 
he also wanted to expand the politburo in a move that would tend 
to diffuse power but he said it was likely the body would remain 
as it is 
several politburo members said they would step down and party 
leaders said 80 percent to 90 percent of the members of the 
policymaking central committee might be changed 
it was unclear whether that would make much of a difference 
gorbachev already has replaced most of the politburo and retired 
many old members of the central committee with little effect 
gorbachevs position as party leader was secure despite a 
barrage of criticism neither traditionalists nor reformers could 
find another acceptable candidate 
when delegates showed a burst of independence unthinkable in 
previous congresses by declaring that they would give each 
politburo member a separate evaluation gorbachev quickly cowed 
them with a warning they would split the party 
for those watching from the outside it hardly mattered 
i dont think theres any point to struggle with the soviet 
communist party said reformminded historian yuri afanasiev who 
quit the party two months before the congress it is leaving the 
stage it is simply falling apart

tens of thousands of african 
national congress supporters marched in cities across the country 
saturday to protest black factional fighting in natal province that 
has claimed thousands of lives 
official permission was granted for about 20 peace marches 
planned by the anc and its allies the congress of south african 
trade unions and the united democratic front to mark the end of a 
week of national protest against the violence petitions protesting 
the violence were presented to authorities at various police 
stations throughout the country 
about 80000 protesters staged a peaceful march through the 
streets in the eastern cape province city of port elizabeth the 
high turnout was attributed to the region being a traditional anc 
stronghold 
there were no incidents despite a heavy police and army presence 
and the sealing off of some roads with barbed wire 
the march was led by recently returned anc exile thobile mhlahlo 
and former police lieutenant gregory rockman who last year exposed 
incidents of police brutality 
a memorandum delivered to police read this is not 
blackonblack violence its also neither faction fighting but 
apartheid war president fw de klerk was urged to stop the 
violence 
about 12000 people marched through the natal capital durban 
protesters carried huge cloth banners that read stop the 
apartheid war defend natal 
they presented a memo to the local police commander col kobus 
le roux 
the johannesburg march was led by anc internal leader walter 
sisulu who was released in october after 25 years in jail he led 
about 2000 protesters to police headquarters john voster square 
sisulu and three senior activists presented a ninepage memo to 
police protesting the terrible carnage taking place in natal 
the government has to do something positive to bring peace in 
that region sisulu said after delivering the petition 
about 500 protesters marched through pretoria to deliver their 
petition to police 
authorities refused applications for marches in five towns which 
have been the scenes of racial conflict and white rightwing 
activity in recent months 
about 800 security force members were deployed in vereeniging 
one of the five towns to ensure a planned march did not go ahead 
the independent south african press association said police 
stopped 5000 black youths from marching they then gathered at the 
towns black township sebokeng where several blacks were killed 
by police during a protest march 26 
sebokengs police commander col paddy mazibuko said that 
since the march was thwarted the crowd had gathered in the 
township to attend the funeral of two local activists march 
organizers confirmed this 
the weeklong protest was aimed at drawing attention to four 
years of conflict in natal between supporters of the anc and 
inkatha a conservative zulu party more than 4000 people have 
died in the violence which the anc claims is caused by inkatha 
de klerk lifted most of the countrys state of emergency last 
month but kept it in natal because of the violence in the region 
the anc claims the government has not taken firm steps to stop 
the fighting it has demanded that the government end the state of 
emergency in natal and disband the police force of the kwazulu 
homeland inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi heads the homeland 
organizers of the protest said there could be no political 
settlement in south africa until the natal violence ended they 
said the natal crisis was an obstacle to a negotiated settlement to 
end whiteminority rule 
the anc and the government have begun a process of talks which 
they hope will lead to a peaceful end to apartheid both sides have 
identified various obstacles which they want removed before 
negotiations can begin

president bush cabled mikhail s gorbachev to 
reaffirm support for the soviet leaders economic reforms while 
flying to the texas summit hes hosting for his counterparts from 
major industrialized nations 
chief presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the president 
sent gorbachev the message from air force one his executive jet 
as he was flying to houston from the london nato summit friday 
night 
fitzwater revealed the communication from bush to gorbachev 
while briefing reporters today on meeting bush held here with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu bush expressed his support 
for gorbachevs program of perestroika or economic restructuring 
the spokesman said fitzwater said that bush gave his personal 
reflections with a little personal emphasis on justconcluded 
nato meeting the spokesman said 
bush was very pleased with the reaction of the soviet union to 
the summit fitzwater said citing the favorable comments issued 
by soviet officials gorbachev had said friday he was anxious to 
accept natos offer to address a future meeting of the western 
alliance 
bush had told reporters on the flight that he received a recent 
communique from gorbachev while he refused to disclose its 
contents there was speculation that it was similar to a recent 
letter gorbachev wrote to prime minister margaret thatcher 
appealing for western aid 
on the question of possible western aid to the soviets 
fitzwater said it would undoubtedly be raised at the houston 
economic summit and said there are a lot of things they can 
consider short of direct aid 
fitzwater also said the united states was willing to discuss 
the matter of bilateral aid by other countries to china which is 
still under economic sanctions from many countries 
bush started his bilateral session with kaifu by indicating the 
united states wouldl acquiesce to japans proceeding with its plan 
to give economic assistance to beijing 
japan is a sovereign nation the president told reporters 
they can make up their own minds on a lot of questions bush 
had been asked whether he would try to dissuade kaifu from 
proceeding with the loan package 
they work very cooperatively with the united states but 
sometimes they have interests that predominate bush added 
while the united states still retains sanctions against bejing 
in the wake of last years bloody crackdown on chinese 
prodemocracy demonstrations the bush administration has chipped 
away at those sanctions and said that the united states does not 
want to isolate such a geopolitically important country 
bush and kaifu got a jump on the sevennation economic summit 
which officially begins monday with their meeting scheduled today 
most of the other participants were due early too for some 
texasstyle social preliminaries 
the leaders of the worlds richest democracies faced a full 
likely contentious agenda ranging from whether to provide the 
soviet union with cash and other direct assistance to how to 
resolve a family trade fight involving billions of dollars in 
agricultural subsidies 
other countries participating in the 16th annual economic summit 
were britain west germany france italy and canada 
this was the first time in seven years that one of these 
gatherings has been in the united states and houston picked by 
the president because it is his adopted hometown was going all out 
to prove that the city has made a dramatic turnaround since hitting 
bottom during the oil price bust in the last decade 
before the formal summit talks began bush was playing host to 
the other summit leaders at a combination rodeo barbecue and 
performance by the grand ole opry on sunday 
flags of the summit countries were flying everywhere and the 
city gleamed in the wake of an effort by thousands of volunteers to 
clear it of trash and debris the actual meetings between the 
leaders will be held at rice university a 4000student private 
university located about five miles from downtown 
all of the talks were expected to involve a search for consensus 
on the differences separating the countries and some of those 
threatened to fray rather than bind their connections 
on soviet aid the united states britain and japan found 
themselves aligned in opposition to a proposal being pushed by west 
germany and france to provide a 15 billion assistance package to 
bail out president mikhail gorbachevs floundering economic reforms 
bush on friday continued to insist that such aid would 
inappropriate at a time when the soviet union is still spending 
huge sums on its military and also providing 5 billion annually to 
support cuba 
however the president seemed to open the door to a possible 
compromise with western allies when he suggested that it might be 
possible for the united states to extend trade credits such 
credits could take the form of loan guarantees provided to the 
soviets on their purchases of american farm and industrial products

mikhail s gorbachev turned defeat into victory 
saturday by persuading the communist party congress to drop plans 
to evaluate each member of the ruling politburo warning that such 
action would bury the party 
delegates to the 28th communist party congress have criticized 
many of the 12 politburo members and wanted to give the thumbsup 
or thumbsdown on each of them 
the delegates voted 2557 to 1393 for such a chance before 
their afternoon break but gorbachev later warned if you want to 
bury the party to split the party then continue on this way 
think think hard think hard 
the ire of the 59yearold soviet leader who has skillfully 
consolidated his position at the congress prompted the delegates 
to vote 2495 to 1515 to reverse themselves 
in his argument gorbachev read a note from the northern russian 
city of arkhangelsk that said there is no need to evaluate each 
politburo member the politburo according to the rules is an 
organ of the leadership and the leadership is collective 
instead the congress agreed to evaluate the policymaking 
central committee and within it the politburo as a whole 
politburo member vladimir ivashko later read a draft of a 
resolution on the central committee that is to be voted on this 
week 
the draft praises the committee for major changes enacted since 
the last congress in 1986 the move toward democracy and free 
elections but it blames the party for failing to carry out party 
policy leading to social and economic difficulties 
the congress broke a decadesold tradition last week by 
requiring each politburo member to account for his work and answer 
written questions from the nearly 4700 delegates 
inna dementyeva a moscow delegate said the vote on personal 
evaluations would have gone too far 
our russian thirst for blood is showing she said its 
stupid and ugly and inhuman 
delegates interviewed in the lobby of the kremlin palace of 
congresses said that allowing the mostly conservative congress to 
vote on individual leaders also might have embarrassed gorbachev 
and his allies and benefited such conservative critics as yegor k 
ligachev 
some also said they had expected at least half the politburo to 
get the thumbs down particulary ideology chief vadim a medvedev 
and international policy head alexander n yakovlev 
collective responsibility is no responsibility said a 
byelorussian delegate who identified himself only as alexander 
and there should be a full renewal of the leadership 
several politburo members responded to the written questions 
they received from delegates and medvedev said he had been accused 
of letting party ideology crumble and discipline among soviet 
journalists break down 
he responded that the party had shed fossilized thinking and 
dogmatism and that journalists should be governed by law and 
their party and civic conscience 
yakovlev one of gorbachevs closest advisers said he had been 
accused of connivance to separatism in the baltic republics and 
the loss of eastern europe 
he responded that he had spoken out against separatism and 
nationalism and that the people of eastern europe were the ones who 
rejected the communist party 
ligachev also took the floor and said he opposed reunification 
of the german states because the west was absorbing the east 
he criticized the concept of private property and plans to 
convert the soviet union to a marketoriented economy saying 
proponents of free market relations should become the first 
soviet unemployed 
ligachev also opposed political reforms that would diminish the 
partys role in society and government i dont see another force 
other than the party which could bring progress to our country 
he said 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze defended soviet policy 
on german unity saying moscows interests could best be served 
through international negotiations rather than attempts to block 
the merger 
he received only mild applause but drew strong support when he 
reminded the congress that the republic of georgia under his 
leadership started to fight corruption in the party 
although gorbachev preserved the facade of collective leadership 
by defeating individual evaluations of politburo members major 
personnel changes are expected at the congress yakovlev medvedev 
and lev zaikov have indicated they plan to step down from the 
politburo 
the congress will choose a new central committee which in turn 
will select a new politburo 
delegates said there did not appear to be any serious challenge 
to gorbachev as party leader nominations for the post were delayed 
until later this week 
in a draft of party rules the congress will elect a new party 
leader the general secretary and create a new post of deputy 
general secretary also to be elected by the congress 
among the candidates mentioned for the no 2 post are ligachev 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov interior minister vadim bakatin and 
pravda editor ivan frolov but gorbachev adviser georgy 
shakhnazarov said he thought the deputy might turn out to be 
someone completely new

police here have been authorized to 
use stun guns as an alternative to nightsticks but theres a catch 
any officer who wants to use the device has to get zapped first 
to know what its like 
forty pompano beach officers have signed up for a sixhour 
course on the use of the electric weapon the officers are 
responsible for buying their own stun guns which cost an average 
of about 150 
getting zapped is the last part of the course and on friday 
officers of all sizes yelled and crumpled helplessly to the ground 
when they were touched with the stun gun and the electricity hit 
their muscles 
its really a convincer officer bill butler said after he 
experienced it its like something really biting into you 
it hurt a lot said officer kathy konieczka 
after being zapped officers said they would not hesitate to use 
the guns as a last resort in place of physical restraint 
a nightstick will injure someone butler said 
officer ken holland who is in charge of the training program 
said the stun guns are completely safe but there are precautions 
an officer must stop the current as soon as the subject falls and 
they are forbidden to place the device on a persons head face or 
groin 
twelve officers carried the guns during a pilot program that 
began in february the weapons have been used 12 times with no 
complaints and no injuries holland said 
all were violent or potentially violent situations he said 
we had no allegations of abuse or use of excessive force 
the weapons shock is supposed to do nothing more than render a 
person defenseless for a few seconds 
it has nothing to do with your brain or heart police 
spokeswoman sandra king said your muscles will go limp for a 
couple of seconds 
and use of the guns will be strictly monitored 
any time the officer takes it out or shows it to someone they 
have to fill out a long form explaining why they pulled it out 
king said

katrin matthes got out of bed before dawn 
saturday left her home in southern east germany and drove three 
hours to west berlin to find food she can afford 
she was among hundreds of east germans crowding into a west 
berlin store to buy meat butter and milk that paradoxically are 
suddenly cheaper in the wealthy west than the struggling east 
the 17yearold factory worker from dresden paid 102 german 
marks 60 for groceries she said will feed her and three dresden 
families in the next few days 
it would have cost 300 marks 180 in east germany she 
said 
the stunning rise in prices just days after the german states 
merged their economies has created a scandal in both countries and 
sent droves of east germans into western grocery stores 
after the two nations unified their economies on july 1 east 
german stores began filling their shelves with western products 
but because east german stores face substantially less 
competition their prices are not only three or four times higher 
than before economic unification but also often higher than the 
same goods sold in west germany 
german media reported a flood of east germans heading west on 
saturday the first shopping weekend since the economic merger and 
the first saturday of the month when west german stores by law are 
allowed to stay open longer 
at one store a pound of salt was selling for 21 cents while in 
east berlin it was selling for 72 cents 
anna neitman a 22yearold student from the southern city of 
leipzig said the east german stores that were once stateowned and 
sold food at governmentset prices are now taking advantage of 
their captive markets 
we have to buy what they sell unless we come here she said 
as she stood outside a west berlin supermarket 
andries kurjo a west berlin economist and a leading expert on 
the east german agricultural economy said consumers will have to 
rebel to bring prices down 
the consumers wont accept these high prices he said 
they have to pay for bread that is four times higher they can 
get the same things in some west german shops much cheaper 
prime minister lothar de maiziere of east germany criticized the 
price increases last week and government officials asked consumers 
to begin reporting instances of price gouging 
the east german parliament on friday passed a law intended to 
break up the two large grocery chains that hold a virtual monopoly 
in the east german food business 
the law would allow communities to sell the formerly stateowned 
stores in their towns 
kurjo however said he expected few takers who has the money 
to buy them who has the knowledge to run such a store he said 
the two grocery store chains ho and konsum made deals with 
eight large west german companies in march to sell western 
products which now dominate the marketplace 
konsum in a statement on saturday denied that it was a 
monopoly and sharply criticized the law passed friday by parliament 
the chains board said the property rights of the company are 
protected and inviolable according to a statement carried by 
the east german news agency adn 
it said that 1500 stores were being run by private proprietors 
and that there were applications to run 600 others the statement 
claimed the chain is not a monopoly because it is not owned by its 
wholesalers 
kurjo however said the chains were monopolies because they 
dominate their markets with little competition and the products 
they sell are strictly regulated by their agreements with the west 
german firms 
ho and konsum were glad to get into these agreements but it 
has led to this monopoly kurjo said 
now they are under the control of the western food chains 
there is no real competition the lack of competition is so bad 
that east german producers are not allowed to offer their 
products in these shops he said 
many stores in smaller towns sell east german agricultural 
products but many of those prices also are higher because the 
government has eliminated the state subsidies of the old communist 
regime he said 
kurjo said consumers can bring prices down only by refusing to 
buy outrageously priced products buying in west german stores that 
sell cheaper goods because they face more competition 
he said east german farmers must be willing to find new ways to 
market distribute and sell their products if they want to survive 
retailers learned quickly however and their grasp of the laws 
of supply and demand drew some sour comment from german media 
with bravura the former staunchly socialist konsum and ho have 
sprung into the market economy as capitalistic as the greediest 
capitalist east germanys adn news agency said

the holding company for khashoggis us interests declared

two years ago khashoggi paid the triad estate 32 million 
which forms the bulk of money now being disbursed to creditors

the estate bringing the total amount paid to unsecured creditors

former paratrooper chuck beckman watched and 
remembered saturday as a group of modern army airborne troops 
marched past him in combat dress their backs straight jaws out 
and berets cocked just so 
we were tough he said but i dont know if we were that 
tough 
beckman from southern pines nc was one of several thousand 
former paratroopers who gathered in washington over the weekend and 
held a parade saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of americas 
airborne military 
former paratroopers from world war ii like beckman as well as 
those from the korean and vietnam wars and the periods in between 
and since also took part 
some marched and others chose to watch alex madsen 69 of 
solvang calif watched from a park bench with a friend from the 
old days hg bennett 73 of sun city ariz 
you know weve spent a lot of money just to come to a bull 
session madsen joked 
both were members of the armys 507th airborne regiment 
headquarters company and both parachuted into normandy on dday 
1944 they also parachuted at the rhine crossing in 1945 and 
madsen wore his paratroopers wings bearing a pair of stars one 
for each combat drop 
there were veterans from all periods but the world war ii 
crowd the original paratroopers were most in evidence they 
marched together with what was left of their old regiments 
the brass also was there retired gen william c westmoreland 
who was us military commander in vietnam from 1964 to 1968 
received the marching mens salutes at a reviewing stand 
only 13 grayhaired men marched with the original 501st 
parachute batallion which was formed in 1940 in other groups 
some rode in wheelchairs or walked on crutches and some wore what 
they could of their old uniforms 
its air conditioned one marching veteran said to the 
crowd tugging at the jacket that no longer met in the middle 
the allblack 555th battalion also marched 
charles mccloed 63 of philadelphia became a member of the 
555th in 1946 volunteering after a year in germany with army 
intelligence he served until 1950 and recalled when the order to 
integrate came in 1948 the battalion was made a part of another 
unit 
it was just on paper he said we stayed in the same 
place at fort bragg we just changed the patches on our 
shoulders 
paratroopers have always been a closeknit group in a way that 
transcended boundaries of race or rank he said i dont care 
whether its a general or a private today we all just say how 
you doing trooper mccloed said 
there were old jeeps trucks even a restored staff car all 
privately owned 
tony lambros a vietnam veteran from fallston md drove a jeep 
nearly as storied as the old veterans he carried in it the jeep 
landed in the invasion in 1944 and carries documentation of its 
stops through belgium and france where it stayed until it was sold 
as salvage more than 15 years after the war he said 
the world they fought in has been changing rapidly these 
veterans of the war in europe acknowledged but there were few 
regrets or sounds of alarm about the unification of germany or the 
easing of eastwest tensions 
i welcome it madsen said lets hope that the day will 
come when its no longer necessary to have such a vast amount of 
money tied up in the military

the louisiana senate today sustained 
gov buddy roemers veto of the nations toughest state abortion 
bill coming three votes shy of the number needed to override 
however the issue was not dead and a second vote on the issue 
is likely to be taken sunday under legislative rules the fact 
that a simple majority was in favor meant that backers can try for 
another vote on the issue sunday 
the vote in favor of the override was 2316 it takes 26 votes 
in the senate to override a veto 
the house voted to override friday 
the senators debated as chanting abortion foes and a few 
prochoice demonstrators gathered in the balcony in the capitol 
rotunda and outside at one point state troopers carried a 
screaming woman from the balcony after she interrupted the speech 
of an abortion opponent 
had the override succeeded it would have been the first time 
this century that louisiana legislators had overruled a governors 
veto 
roemer vetoed the measure friday because it made no exceptions 
for victims of rape or incest 
it is not just the people outside this building or in this 
state watching what we do said override backer sen mike cross 
a coauthor of the bill people all over the country all over 
the world are watching us i hope you will say no that you will 
not continue to do away with future generations 
sen sydney nelson who wanted the veto upheld said that a bill 
that did not include exceptions for rape and incest is inhumane 
im not for abortion on demand or for gender selection or birth 
control he said but for me as a man to say to the women of 
this state that we dont care how you get pregnant you must carry 
to term i just cant do that 
the deadline for action is midnight monday when the legislature 
is due to adjourn 
late friday the state house voted 7331 to reject roemers 
veto it was the first time this century that even one chamber of 
the legislature had overridden a veto in louisiana 
but the house unlike the senate had passed the bill by more 
than a twothirds majority in the first place 
as the senate resumed work this morning most of the 34story 
capitol building was sealed off to the public in order to better 
control demonstrators said senate president samuel nunez 
demonstrators were being allowed in the rotunda area and the 
upstairs gallery of the senate 
in the rotunda some 500 opponents chanted override 
override and waved antiabortion bumper stickers scattered 
among the crowd were small groups of abortion rights demonstrators 
one of the few abortion rights demonstrators in the gallery 
during todays debate interrupted sen john saunders antiabortion 
speech when he told the senate that none of the hundreds of 
demonstrators outside the chamber was carrying signs in support of 
the veto 
yes there is yes there is the woman screamed two state 
troopers carried her out of the balcony as she yelled let me 
go a few seconds of stunned silence followed before saunders 
said well there is one 
the woman identified as karen anklam 26 of new orleans was 
not arrested she was ordered out of the capitol and allowed to 
listen to the senate debate on loudspeakers set up outside 
before the senate quit for the day friday night sen allen 
bares a supporter of the bill acknowledged to his colleagues that 
abortion foes do not have the necessary twothirds majority of the 
senate 
proponents of an override were already at work buying fullpage 
ads in new orleans baton rouge and lake charles newspapers 
featuring a message from mother teresa of calcutta who sent a 
telegram to roemer in favor of the bill 
the bill passed two weeks ago would allow abortion only to save 
the life of the mother doctors could get up to 10 years in prison 
for performing an abortion 
the bill was written to challenge the 1973 supreme court 
decision roe vs wade that recognized the right to an abortion 
the governors forces wanted an immediate vote to sustain his 
veto but bares got his colleagues to adjourn 
this issue is too important to handle this late at night 
without a hearing bares said 
robin rothrock leader of an abortion rights coalition had said 
earlier she was confident the senate would sustain roemers veto 
in the senate we believe that we still have the 15 
legislators who voted against the measure when it passed the senate 
with 24 votes she said 
in his veto message roemer responded to charges he changed his 
position on abortion since he was a member of congress running for 
governor in 1987 
as a member of congress i consistently voted to curb abortion 
on demand and to protect the life of a fetus roemer wrote i 
initially voted for the exception to save the life of a mother but 
over the years of struggling with this issue i became acutely aware 
of the need to except those instances where conception occurred 
because of rape or incest 
women cannot and should not be forced to bear the consequences 
of these traumatic illegal acts 
the bills author rep woody jenkins cited statistics in a 
house debate that out of more than 15000 abortions performed in 
louisiana in 1987 only one was doe to end a pregnancy that 
resulted from rape 
hes for killing 15000 unborn children a year in louisiana 
just to make sure that one child conceived in rape is also 
killed said jenkins

according to the communique walesa and mazowiecki promised 
cooperation for the good of our country and further progress in 
democratization 
the statement didnt say what subjects mazowiecki and walesa 
discussed or whether they made any deals for the others 
cooperation 
mazowiecki has recently drawn sharp criticism from farmers and 
the faction of solidarity loyal to walesa 
in a bid to deflect the attacks the prime minister ousted three 
of the four communists in his cabinet on friday and caved in to 
walesas demands for elections earlier than next year 
he also appealed to the public and especially farmers for 
patience and selfrestraint 
but the moves did not satisfy the farmers demanding guaranteed 
minimum prices for their produce and threatening a nationwide road 
blockade on monday 
about 3000 farmers marched through central warsaw and then took 
up a vigil outside the council of ministers building for most of 
the day saturday inside negotiations between farmers unions and 
senior government officials lasted into the evening before breaking 
up with no results 
at least one leader of the protesters said they might try to 
bring down the government it is not our goal but it may be 
necessary said bogdan wlodarczyk vicechairman of the farmers 
strike committee 
if i know that in a few weeks i will not have any money to buy 
something for my child then nothing will restrain me he said 
walesa for months has been urging mazowiecki to accelerate 
political and economic changes particularly by removing communists 
from positions of authority in government and the economy 
beginning widescale privatization of state industries and holding 
early elections to parliament and the presidency 
walesa himself is considered the most likely candidate for 
president to remove president wojciech jaruzelski the longtime 
communist leader who has held the office for one year 
walesas criticisms have been accompanied by warnings to the 
solidarityled government he helped install that it was losing 
touch with the common people who are solidaritys base 
one example is the farmers who claim they cannot survive under 
the governments shock economic program the program has resulted 
in falling consumer demand leading to a glut of produce and low 
prices for farmers 
a national farm protest committee said all major highways in 
poland will be blocked for one hour on monday from noon to 1 pm

a 60 minutes show on bridgeport 
painted such a bleak picture of the city that hundreds of people 
wrote to offer the new mayor some free if not always sound advice 
on how to turn things around 
some even sent cash after the piece on bridgeport aired this 
spring including a man who wrote a check for 250 in appreciation 
of a general electric toaster manufactured in bridgeport many years 
ago 
its still working fine the man wrote 
two people from california both impressed with mayor mary 
morans portrayal as the antipolitician sent 100 each total 
donations topped 300 
we were appalled and heartsick at the monumental task you 
face one family wrote 
cbs depicted bridgeport a city of 142000 about 55 miles 
northeast of new york city as a oncemajor industrial center on 
the verge of economic collapse viewers were shown shot after 
shot of blighted housing and abandoned factories in a city 
described as depressed discouraged and broke 
the letterwriters ranged from a wall street investment firm to 
inventors with sometimes dubious claims about the moneymaking 
potential of their products and consultants seeking to be added to 
the citys payroll a chain letter that reached city hall and 
never left promised good fortune if the letter was sent on it 
warned of disastrous consequences if it was broken 
a man from ohio was not pleased when he saw the mayor cooking 
breakfast for her husband on 60 minutes he told her she could 
not be both a housewife and mayor of a city with so many problems 
let your husband learn how to fix his own breakfast a simple 
task millions of males already do for themselves he said before 
going on to suggest she should report for work at 5 am 
hong kong millionaires seeking to leave the british crown colony 
before it comes under chinese rule would answer to the citys 
economic difficulties several writers said 
if these men were offered a haven in bridgeport by buying up 
some old rundown sewing or other factories and turning them into 
modern enterprises you couldnt fail a woman writing from new 
york enthused 
in response to the show a 1000 prize is being offered to the 
person who can produce the best videotape showing bridgeports good 
side the contest which ends july 30 is called 6 minutes 
bridgeport reels back 
the top entries are to be shown next month at a downtown movie 
house that the owner has dubbed the ghost theater because of 
the 60 minutes claim that bridgeport has no cinema the cinema 
once featured xrated films but is now a family theater 
frank borres director of communications for the bank mart and 
one of the contest organizers said the 60 minutes segment on 
bridgeport was pretty scary because it was real 
moran a republican who upset twoterm incumbent thomas bucci 
last november in her first bid for major public office said shes 
grateful for the letters 
i think its wonderful that people would sit down and say 
this is what you could do whether it was good advice or not 
she said 
moran says the 60 minutes piece fell short in not showing 
the good things bridgeport has to offer the reasons why i would 
want to become mayor 
she cited the citys zoo museums parks symphony ballet pt 
barnum museum and proximity to new york as some of bridgeports 
many attributes 
the legislature imposed state review of bridgeports finances in 
1988 as a condition for guaranteeing a 35 million loan needed to 
cover accumulated deficits with no real growth in the tax base for 
five years now the city had to raise taxes 5 percent this year and 
eliminate about 170 jobs through layoffs and attrition 
homicides meanwhile have been occurring at a recordshattering 
pace there have already been 38 homicides here this year compared 
with 42 for all of last year a police official said 
moran says the best thing to come out of the controversy is that 
it made bridgeporters talk positively about their city for the 
first time in a long time 
people said how dare they attack us it was like when 
someone attacks your child moran said

the government overpaid as much as 1 million 
in bonuses to two hubble space telescope contractors for their cost 
control efforts on the device which has been a major headache for 
nasa a magazine reported saturday 
congressional quarterly reported in its july 7 edition that the 
overpayments occurred at the same time costs for the expensive 
telescope were rising dramatically the original cost estimate for 
the hubble was 678 million but its final price tag was more than 
15 billion 
the magazine said information about the bonus was contained in a 
july 1989 audit report by the national aeronautics and space 
administrations office of inspector general the material was 
obtained through a freedom of information act request 
the hubble was launched april 24 and nasa announced june 27 that 
its two main mirrors would not focus properly a manufacturing 
error was suspected 
congressional quarterly said the inspector generals report 
accused nasa management of not properly considering all cost 
overruns in figuring cost control bonuses paid to hubbles two 
principal contractors lockheed corp and perkinelmer corp now 
hughesdanbury optical systems inc which built the telescopes 
mirrors 
lockheed received 144 million in bonuses and hughesdanbury 
was paid 6 million in bonuses through april 30 1987 the report 
said if nasa had fully considered the cost overruns the bonuses 
may have been reduced by as much as 1 million it said 
attempts saturday to reach either of the contractors and nasa 
were unsuccessful but congressional quarterly quoted project 
managers at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala as 
disagreeing with the audit conclusions while promising to implement 
many of the reports recommendations 
a lockheed official also took issue with the report 
if this thing followed its normal course they probably didnt 
pay us enough h hollister cantus vice president of lockheeds 
space group told the magazine 
if youre going to do business with nasa dont expect to make 
a large profit nasa is a damned tough taskmaster he added 
the magazine said hughesdanbury declined to comment 
a nasa lawyer told congressional quarterly that the agency did 
withhold a significant amount of award fees that could have 
gone to the contractors francis p larocca jr said nasa declined 
to give the companies about 66 million of an available 27 
million

louisianas senate voted saturday 
against overriding gov buddy roemers veto of what would have been 
the nations toughest state abortion law 
the vote was 23 in favor of the override three short of the 
twothirds majority needed and 16 against when the bill to make 
abortion a criminal offense passed the senate last month it got 24 
votes 
the failure of the override attempt was not final however 
under legislative rules the bills backers get a second chance 
sunday because a simple majority was on their side for the 
override to pass the senate must act before the legislature 
adjourns at midnight monday 
well pray that we can change some minds said rep woody 
jenkins author of the measure 
the house had approved the override measure late friday 
terri bartlett director of planned parenthood of louisiana 
told her jubilant supporters that the battle wasnt over 
tomorrows vote is as critical and as important as the one that 
happened today she said 
after the vote viewers quietly filed out of the gallery in the 
rotunda prochoice backers waved purple flowers and ribbons and 
shouted we won abortion opponents countered with the chant of 
we will win we will win 
if the senate voted to follow the houses lead and override it 
would be the first time this century that a legislature overrode a 
louisiana governors veto 
since the legislative session began in april roemer had said he 
opposed abortion on demand but would veto a measure that made no 
exceptions for rape or incest he did just that friday 
supporters argued that exceptions would allow women to get 
abortions by falsely claiming to have been raped 
the bill provides a maximum 10year prison term and 100000 
fine for people who perform abortions but no penalty for the woman 
obtaining the abortion 
sen mike cross the senate sponsor of the bill warned that 
failing to override the veto would mean legislators would have to 
put up with continued intense emotional lobbying going into next 
years elections 
you think its tough this year said cross its not going 
to wait until next year at this time its going to be a long 
long long year if we dont vote to override the governors veto 
supporters of the bill said it would provide the us supreme 
court with a vehicle to overturn the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
which made most abortions legal because by outlawing abortion 
outright the louisiana bill forces the issue in the simplest 
possible terms 
sen sydney nelson argued that no woman should be forced to 
continue a pregnancy if it results from rape or incest or if there 
is evidence the child will have birth defects he also raised the 
spectre of women resorting to dangerous backalley abortions 
are we as 39 men to make a decision that so materially affects 
the ladies of our state asked nelson i say the governors 
veto is reasonable the governors veto should be sustained 
state police limited access to the capitol to avoid noisy 
demonstrations that might distract from debate 
demonstrators in and out of the capitol were for the most part 
orderly but at one point during the debate state troopers carried 
a screaming woman from the balcony of the senate chamber 
she interrupted sen john saunders antiabortion speech when he 
told the senate that among the hundreds of demonstrators outside 
the chamber there were no signs supporting the veto 
yes there is yes there is the woman screamed two state 
troopers carried her out of the balcony as she yelled let me go 
the woman identified as karen anklam 26 of new orleans was 
not arrested she was ordered out of the capitol and allowed to 
listen to the senate debate on loudspeakers 
theyre not going to stop abortion she said later 
theyre just going to make it so that everythings going to go 
completely haywire 
state police allowed almost 200 demonstrators almost all of 
them backers of the abortion bill to enter the senate chamber 
they allowed 500 others into the rotunda the wide highceilinged 
marblefloored hall that separates the senate and house chambers 
several hundred more gathered on the steps of the capitol 
inside and out the demonstrators sang hymns or broke into chants 
of override override the chants echoing through the rotunda 
could be heard in the senate chamber 
some demonstrators knelt in silent prayer for several minutes at 
a time 
abortion rights advocates but were greatly outnumbered one 
group of about 100 chanted sustain the veto

yugoslavias republic of serbia 
tightened its grip on the ethnic albanian majority in kosovo 
province saturday by disbanding the official trade union 
organization there 
the yugoslav news agency tanjug said the council of trade unions 
of serbia acted because the kosovo council failed to perform its 
role 
in pristina capital of kosovo the albanianlanguage daily 
rilindija carried a sharp protest of serbias occupation of 
kosovo 
ethnic albanians dominate the province and their leaders issued 
a declaration of independence last monday 
serbia responded thursday by dissolving kosovos local governing 
bodies replacing the managers and leading journalists of local 
news organizations and taking albanianlanguage radio and 
television programs off the air 
on friday serbian authorities detained several ethnic albanians 
and large numbers of uniformed police took up positions throughout 
pristina kosovos capital about 150 miles south of belgrade 
heightened security also was reported from other towns in the 
province 
kosovo was calm on saturday tanjug reported 
a group of provincial deputies demanded an emergency session of 
the federal legislature to discuss the situation 
serbian authorities dissolved the local assembly and government 
after 114 assembly members announced plans to secede from serbia 
the largest of the countrys six republics both bodies were 
dominated by ethnic albanians who make up 90 percent of the 
provinces 19 million people 
serbias moves have virtually abolished the autonomy granted the 
southern province under the 1974 yugoslav constitution 
at least 60 ethnic albanians have died in clashes with security 
forces since serbia began limiting autonomy in march 1989 
serbians consider kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom 
they allege ethnic albanians in seeking independence have 
pressured serbians to move out 
ethnic albanians who want free elections and a multiparty 
system deny serbias charges 
they say serbias communist leader slobodan milosevic has used 
such accusations to gain popular support for his drive to control 
kosovo 
the trouble in kosovo is one of many besetting yugoslavias 
fragile communistrun federal governement 
the northern republic of slovenia on monday adopted a 
declaration of regional autonomy and said it would take control of 
yugoslav military on its soil 
yugoslavias federal leadership on friday demanded that the 
republic rescind its proclamation but slovenias presidency on 
saturday refused the tanjug news agency reported 
the authority of the federal leadership has effectively been 
crippled since noncommunist centerright parties won elections 
this year in slovenia and croatia another liberal republic it was 
the first free balloting in yugoslavia in 50 years 
slovenia and croatia are demanding a looser national 
confederation 
the current federation of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces already allows each region to run its own government and 
communist party structure 
the decentralized system of government was devised by the late 
national leader josip broz tito it was intended to prevent one 
republic from gaining sway over the others but ethnic and economic 
differences are again threatening the countrys unity

eight of the saboteurs who blew up a key 
factory in nazi germanys atomic bomb project held their first 
reunion saturday reliving one of world war iis most daring secret 
exploits 
the eight norwegians all in their 70s and retired led several 
thousand people who walked along a new saboteurs trail a 
fivemile path that follows the route they used to reach the 
germanoperated plant in telemark county 
we didnt recognize the importance of what we did until the 
atomic bomb was dropped on japan said joachim roenneberg 
recalling the night of feb 28 1943 when the 10 men blew up the 
nazi heavy water plant near rjukan 125 miles northwest of oslo 
the allies fearing germany would build an atomic bomb before 
the west had ordered the plant destroyed at any cost after an 
aircraft carrying british commandos crashed in occupied norway it 
was up to the norwegians 
on saturday the eight saboteurs attending the ceremony stood at 
attention for the norwegian national anthem one of the 10 has died 
and another was unable to attend 
women and children handed them flowers and many in the crowd 
cried 
volunteers in rjukan a town of 4500 built the hiking trail 
the 10 norwegians have been celebrated in books and movies 
including the american film production heroes of telemark 
roenneberg who led the expedition at 23 years old said it 
was not like a military operation it was more like a group of 
friends who set out to do something together 
the mostly britishtrained saboteurs parachuted into norway and 
weeks later approached rjukan new yorkborn knut haukelig said 
they slid down a mountain through wet snow and waited for darkness 
one man remained behind as a radio operator five stayed near a 
german barracks ready to fight if the german soldiers were alerted 
four saboteurs found an unguarded railroad line leading to the 
plant and crawled through a pipe into its basement they met only a 
norwegian technician who did not resist 
roenneberg said they set explosives with fuses that gave them 30 
seconds to escape the saboteurs made their way back into the 
mountains and some skied 250 miles in 14 days to sweden before 
heading back to england

a couple with cerebral palsy who use a golf 
cart to drive city streets are challenging police orders to get 
them off the road saying the car provides their only means of 
transport 
john l shauberger 45 of lake city was cited may 21 for 
driving without a license and operating an unregistered vehicle he 
faced a magistrates hearing which was scheduled for friday but 
suspended 
if he is convicted and ordered not to drive the cart on public 
streets shauberger said he and kathy would be forced to walk with 
a cane or depend on others for rides 
thats not independence as far as im concerned said 
shauberger who added that he cant afford a car modified for 
handicapped drivers 
shauberger can walk with the assistance of a cane his 
28yearold wife is confined to a wheelchair 
district justice charles wise suspended completion of the 
hearing because shaubergers lawyer could not attend wise said he 
would rule on the traffic citations and decide whether to fine 
shauberger 370 after the lawyer presents his case 
wise said he would consider whether the golf cart qualifies as a 
wheelchair when he rules on the citations 
state trooper paul mcguire who testified friday said 
wheelchairs are exempt from being registered although operators 
must be licensed to travel on roads 
i think the essence of this whole case is really the 
definition of a wheelchair wise said it would seem to me that 
a golf cart would be safer than a little narrow wheelchair on the 
highway 
the magistrate said shauberger had been cited for driving in a 
traffic lane of the highway without a drivers license in an 
unregistered cart 
mcguire has stopped shauberger twice this year he said he and 
other troopers previously had warned shauberger not to drive on the 
highway

the worlds poorest nations have told the 
industrial countries meeting at a houston summit that they must 
provide more aid and debt relief to avoid a spiral of poverty and 
social unrest in the third world 
it is proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no 
substitute for a market economy and this is what we strive to 
achieve said ahg mohiuddin un ambassador of bangladesh and 
spokesman for the 42 nations known as the least developed countries 
but if our efforts are not met by commensurate aid we will be 
faced with social unrest which will undo all our good work he 
said in an interview before this weeks houston summit of the 
united states and six other leading industrial nations 
we have tightened our belts beyond our capacity and if there 
is a failure in reciprocal commitment from the industrial world 
then it will be suicidal for us he said 
mohiuddin has visited the capitals of the seven nations to 
sensitize them to the needs of the impoverished third world 
the poorest of the poor 
the poor nations are calling for development assistance in the 
form of 15 percent of the industrial nations gross national 
product by 1995 and 20 percent by the end of the decade they also 
seek debt cancellation and reduction and removal of trade barriers 
to their exports 
in general the bangladesh envoy said the response was positive 
but not specific the poorest nations hope that the final 
communique from the houston summit will address some of their 
problems 
nordic countries and most participants in the houston summit are 
approaching or have reached the development assistance sought by 
the poor nations 
however the united states and japan which give extensive aid 
have opposed aid targets the united states gives about 04 percent 
of its gnp the total annual value of produced goods and services 
to the worlds poorest nations 
the houston session could foreshadow what will happen at an 
international conference on the least developed countries in paris 
in september when a plan of domestic action and foreign help is to 
be developed officials of the poorest nations hope the wealthiest 
ones will persuade others in the international arena to support 
their cause 
but the wealthiest nations recently have been emphasizing the 
importance of respecting human rights and instituting democratic 
political reforms as conditions for foreign aid in eastern europe 
and elsewhere 
the poorest nations respond by saying that poverty is the 
greatest obstacle to human rights everywhere 
the poorest nations have expressed concern that aid to the 
emerging democracies of eastern europe should not take away from 
the industrial nations commitment to help the poorest countries 
which have a total of 475 million people 
the least developed countries as defined by the world bank are 
the worlds most abjectly poor with average per capita incomes of 
less than 500 per year 
their total foreign debt is about 55 billion their annual debt 
service payment alone is nearly 4 billion

the arco chemical cos inquiry into 
the plant explosion that killed 17 people has been stymied by a 
court order issued saturday for the wife of a deceased worker 
in response to her negligence lawsuit against the company a 
judge granted a temporary restraining order preventing atlantic 
richfield co and arco chemical from making any changes to the 
accident scene 
atlantic richfield based in los angeles owns 83 percent of 
arco chemical 
we cant remove anything until osha releases the area to us 
said jack johnson president of arco chemical americas he refused 
to comment further on the lawsuit filed friday by sandra lucas 
davis 
her husband gregory scott davis 27 was one of the names on a 
partial list of victims released by the company saturday 
state district judge shearn smith issued the temporary 
restraining order but it did not prohibit osha the occupational 
safety and health administration from conducting its investigation 
osha officials who were sifting through the damaged area 
expect to complete their investigation in about a week johnson 
said 
assistant secretary of labor gerard f scannell said friday his 
agency was focusing on maintenance reports and complaints that 
employees had to work especially long hours at the plant 
plant manager earl mccaleb said workers normally work 12hour 
shifts for four days then are off four days 
harold sorgenti president of arco chemical said the company 
was concentrating on helping families and employees deal with the 
deaths while making sure the plant is stabilized 
the explosion at about 1130 pm thursday ripped through the 
plants utility area on the extreme southern end of the complex 
where employees were doing maintenance work officials said 
what the employees actually were doing will be determined by 
the investigation sorgenti said initially they were 
beginning to fix a compressor 
initial speculation was that the five arco workers and 11 austin 
industrial inc contract workers killed were cleaning the 
900000gallon tank that exploded the other worker killed was the 
driver of a vacuum truck that was in the area to remove rainwater 
from a sump mccaleb said 
sorgenti also said the investigation will focus on why so many 
people were in the area when normally five people are assigned 
there 
i think its difficult to understand why there was that 
concentration of employees in that area at that time said 
sorgenti who flew to houston from europe where he was on business 
mccaleb said it would be several months before the plant begins 
operating again the 350 arco employees at the plant about 15 
miles east of houston are working to restore the plant and will 
not lose any pay he said 
the arco plant annually produces 560 million pounds of propylene 
oxide used to make flexible foam for seat cushions and bedding it 
also produces 13 billion pounds of styrene monomer used for 
insulation foam drinking cups packaging materials and automotive 
parts and 17 billion pounds of methyl tertiary butyl ether a 
highoctane blending component used as a replacement for lead in 
gasoline 
the explosion was the second major loss of life at a houston 
area petrochemical facility in nine months on oct 23 a series of 
explosions ripped through a phillips petroleum co plant in 
pasadena claiming 23 lives and injuring 130 people

thousands of albanians crowding into 
foreign embassies in hopes of fleeing their hardline communist 
homeland will be allowed to emigrate under foreign supervision 
diplomats said saturday 
also saturday the government announced a shakeup of the ruling 
politburo and central committee it replaced several hardliners 
including the police minister 
about 5000 people are sheltered in missions in the albanian 
capital of tirana western dipomats said many had climbed walls 
and crashed through embassy gates some under fire from security 
forces to gain entry 
hungarian diplomats said the logistics of the emigration had not 
been worked out but ambassadors were told by albanian foreign 
ministry officials their personnel could supervise the issuing of 
travel documents and accompany emigres out of the country 
a solution has been found hungarian ambassador mihaly 
kornidesz told state radio in budapest passports will be issued 
and embassy personnel will be allowed to oversee safe passage 
out of the country 
austrias apa news agency said thousands of protesters gathered 
near embassy row saturday to show their opposition to the hardline 
communist regime no violence was reported 
friday 10000 prodemocracy demonstrators marched in silence 
near embassy row apa reported the silent rally dispersed after a 
brief clash between police and some demonstrators 
reacting to the unrest the policysetting central committee of 
the communist party dismissed a politburo member retired three 
other politicians and relieved police minister simon stefani of his 
position the state news agency ata reported 
hekuran isaj who is regarded as a moderate was announced as 
stefanis replacement ata reported 
ata also reported that three new figures were appointed to the 
politburo and two new appointments were made to the central 
committee 
the changes appeared to reflect the power of communist leader 
ramiz alia and his efforts to reform albanias hardline communist 
system 
also saturday alia decreed several measures to reform albanias 
command economy including the introduction of smallscale private 
enterprise limited to tradesmen and farmers he did not however 
mention the embassy standoff or promise political reforms 
speaking from tirana a hungarian diplomat said on condition of 
anonymity that police sealed off the diplomatic quarter saturday 
afternoon apparently to prevent new asylumseekers from gaining 
access to the missions 
the reported breakthrough came just hours after albanian 
legislators guaranteed citizens could leave the embassies without 
fear of punishment 
the albanian foreign ministry on thursday promised to grant 
passports to those who have sought refuge in foreign missions 
but saturdays parliamentary decree published by the albanian 
state news agency ata was the first pledge with the force of law 
that albanians in the foreign missions could receive passports 
without fear or prosecution 
the thousands of albanians in the foreign embassies were a 
nearintolerable strain on some missions which lacked sufficient 
food and water albanian authorities were not allowing foreign 
governments to send supplies western officials said 
the hungarian diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that under the deal worked out with authorities the albanians were 
to remain in the embassies until told their passports were ready 
on the day of their departure or on the day immediately 
preceding it they will be going in groups to the passport office 
to get documents and can be accompanied by embassy staffers he 
said 
diplomats will be invited to board the aircraft trains buses 
or boats taking albanians to their new homelands the diplomat 
said but only those accepted by a foreign country will be allowed 
to leave he said 
the diplomat said he believed france had already pledged to take 
in all albanians packing its embassy 
in the 45 years of hardline communist rule travel for average 
albanians has been virtually impossible 
but under alia who took power in 1985 the country of 32 
million people has increasingly sought ties abroad and has slowly 
begun to implement reforms 
a package of new regulations that took effect tuesday entitled 
all albanians over age 16 to own a passport 
the ata dispatch said the embassy occupations were calculated to 
create a state of tension and opposition to the laws and 
regulations of the albanian state 
this is also proved by the fact that some countries want to 
send here food tents medicaments so as to turn the yards of the 
embassies into refugees camps 
such brutal interference and antihuman acts are unacceptable 
and punishable ata said 
on friday alia told the central committee that the party would 
not give up power as communists have done elsewhere in eastern 
europe 
the sometimesviolent rush to the embassies in tirana follows 
last years exodus of east germans to embassies in other east 
european countries shortly before the fall of their communist 
government 
most of the albanians who fled to foreign embassies before 
thursday entered in a rush during rioting that began monday under 
fire from albanian security forces diplomats said at least three 
people were wounded

horan a group director of field operations for computer 
sciences computer division was arraigned before superior court

fake or an authentic 6th century bc greek statue

when i first saw the torso in april this year i noticed 
subtle similarities of style and detail between the piece and the 
museums kouros said marion true curator of antiquities this 
gave me reason to reexamine our own statue

police fired bullets and tear gas saturday 
at thousands of demonstrators who defied a government ban and held 
a rally demanding a multiparty democracy 
the disturbances quickly spread throughout the city and police 
pursued demonstrators into nairobis commercial center 
the violence comes after months of agitation for multiparty 
democracy in kenya which has been a oneparty state by law since 
1982 
riot police moved through the streets saturday firing into the 
air and telling crowds to disperse by nightfall only small groups 
of demonstrators remained clashing sporadically with troops 
it was not immediately known if there were any casualties 
witnesses said they saw security forces beat people 
the violence broke out after about 500 protesters gathered at a 
field several blocks from nairobis busy commercial center for a 
rally to demand democracy 
kenneth matiba and charles rubia leading opponents of the 
government who were detained last week had called for the rally 
authorities had denied permission for the rally and president 
daniel arap moi said force would be used to break it up 
we want two parties many protesters shouted waving two 
fingers in the local multiparty salute they were joined by 
thousands of others who had watched the rally from the grounds 
fringes 
the demonstrators many carrying rocks then broke into crowds 
numbering in the hundreds and faced off with security forces who 
tried to block roads around the field trucks bearing dozens of 
armed soldiers headed toward the field 
when protesters stoned a plainclothes police officer and his car 
and commandeered a bus security forces charged the crowd firing 
bullets and tear gas 
panicstricken groups ran into downtown nairobi workers poured 
out of their offices and formed large crowds at bus stops as 
hundreds tried to flee the city most traffic other than buses was 
quickly gone from the streets 
the atmosphere remained tense hours after the clashes 
surrounding streets were littered with rocks glass and other 
debris 
thousands of people milled around downtown nairobi and special 
riot police moved through the streets firing into the air and 
telling crowds to disperse 
sporadic gunfire could be heard downtown throughout the 
afternoon a few shops were looted and isolated groups of 
demonstrators reportedly stoned some cars 
kenya has been at peace since independence from britain in 1963 
it often is cited as an example of stability and prosperity on a 
continent known more for guerrilla warfare military juntas and 
corrupt dictatorship 
since the beginning of the year however a loose coalition 
emboldened by the changes in eastern europe has repeatedly accused 
the ruling kenya african national union party of intolerance 
corruption and electionrigging 
demands for change began jan 1 in an address by the rev 
timothy njhoya long a critic of the government the presbyterian 
pastor urged africans to reflect on the experience of eastern 
europe and choose multiparty democracy 
however the government has rejected any move toward allowing 
other parties and calls its opponents subversives moi says 
multiparty politics would create ethnic strife among the east 
african nations 40 tribes and lead to tribal warfare 
moi has said he will hunt down political pluralists like 
rats 
the government has detained at least 11 opponents since 
wednesday according to their families and other sources close to 
the opposition 
matiba and rubia former cabinet ministers were seized by 
plainclothes security agents other detainees include raila odinga 
son of kenyas first vice president and gitobu imanyara a lawyer 
who edits a magazine critical of the governments human rights 
record 
kenyas last opposition party was banned in 1969 a 
constitutional amendment in 1982 declared kenya a oneparty state 
and last weeks detentions appeared to be the harshest crackdown 
since 1982 
moi has said the existence of about 40 tribes in kenya would 
invite tribalbased parties leading to ethnic divisions and even 
tribal warfare 
on friday the us state department said the detentions only 
serve to tarnish kenyas image in the international community 
and it urged the government not to persecute the opposition

delegates to the national education 
association convention on saturday easily defeated an attempt to 
stop the unions policy of lobbying for abortion rights 
the union was expected to reexamine its stance in favor of 
womens right to abortion at least twice more before it concludes 
business late sunday the union in 1985 agreed to support family 
planning including the right to reproductive freedom 
christine nowak of new york led efforts to eliminate abortion 
lobbying from the legislative agenda of the nations largest 
teachers union she and others argued that union dues should not 
be used for such activity because the neas 2 million members have 
a variety of views on the issue 
in a resounding voice vote the 8100 delegates to the groups 
annual convention rejected the legislative amendment 
nea officials said the union has not yet spent money on the 
issue because it has not come up in congress 
the action came only hours after television producer norman 
lear a leading advocate of the separation of church and state 
urged the nea delegates to focus more on morals during classroom 
instructions 
as educators you probably have more to do with the character 
of the next generation than anyone else lear told the educators 
in a sense you are the architects of that generation he 
said 
lear said teachers cannot successfully instill knowledge in 
young peoples minds unless they also feed the heart and soul 
neither can schools spark students interest in the world 
social wrongs and personal morality unless they also teach about 
the core values that bind society together he said 
educators must fling open the doors and find new ways of 
learning more about each others values and spiritual traditional 
and what we all hold in common he said

charged dominos pizza inc with religious discrimination for 
refusing to hire a sikh man whose religion requires him to wear a 
beard 
the nationwide chain has a policy that all employees must be 
cleanshaven but no maryland health law prohibits food service 
employees from having beards

catonsville was refused employment when he applied for a job as 
manager of a dominos store in december 1987

franchise that interviewed kohli said the complaint was a slap 
in the face to us when we are desperately trying to work things out 
with this individual 
james quoted in saturdays baltimore sun said kohli knew the 
dress code and policies when he interviewed for the job and that he 
also was unwilling to work the weekend and night hours required he 
said other company jobs that did not involve contact with the 
public were available but kohli refused to consider them 
kohli now an engineer with the state highway administration

a european hostage among the 16 
westerners held in lebanon might be released soon irans official 
news agency said saturday sources indicated an irish captive might 
be freed 
most of the hostages are believed held by factions of hezbollah 
or party of god a fundamentalist shiite moslem group that receives 
financial support from iran 
the 47word report from the islamic republic news agency in 
beirut the lebanese capital was attributed to unidentified 
sources the headline read a european hostage may be released 
soon 
a western hostage held in lebanon will probably be released 
soon said the story monitored in nicosia 
sources would not disclose the identity of the hostage to be 
released but hinted that he is most probably a european 
national the dispatch said it is not known when and where the 
hostage will be released 
the hostages are six americans and 10 europeans four britons 
two west germans two swiss an italian and an irishman 
longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
diplomats in tehran said in recent interviews that iranian 
president hashemi rafsanjani has renewed a push to get the 10 
european captives in lebanon freed 
earlier this year iran helped free two american hostages robert 
polhill and frank reed then asked for a reciprocal gesture from 
the united states president bush has said he will not make deals 
for captives 
but an outpouring of western assistance to iran after its 
devastating june 21 earthquake raised hopes in some quarters that 
iran might again use its influence with the proiranian groups 
believed holding the hostages 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani has said iran should be 
grateful for the foreign quake aid however in comments earlier 
this month he made no link between such aid and the release of any 
western hostages 
in washington state department spokesman anita stockman said 
saturday she had no information to confirm the report that another 
hostage may soon be released 
she said the united states provided earthquake aid solely as a 
humanitarian gesture 
while reiterating us policy demanding the unconditional 
release of all hostages she said the hostage issue is also a 
humanitarian issue 
in beirut a source close to the syrian army command said that 
if any hostage were released it probably would be brian keenan an 
irishman who also holds a british passport syria is the main power 
broker in lebanons 14yearold civil war but has little direct 
hold over the hostagetakers 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity refused to say 
why he thought keenan might be freed 
a threeman delegation from irelands ruling party visited 
tehran in midjune an irish red cross aid plane was the first to 
reach tehran after the quake 
keenan 39 was kidnapped in moslem west beirut april 11 1986 
as he walked from his home to the american university of beirut 
where he taught english 
no group has claimed to be holding keenan of belfast but reed 
said after his release from captivity in april that he had seen 
keenan 
we are hopeful but our hopes have been raised many times 
before said michael gillham keenans brotherinlaw speaking 
from his home in dundonald northern ireland 
it is looking good for somebody at least to be freed and if 
that happens it will be good news whoever it is he said 
in moville ireland prime minister charles haughey said we 
are following developments very closely i am always hopeful we 
are making a total allout effort constantly using every means at 
our disposal our embassy and friends 
factions within hezbollah are believed loyal to both 
antiwestern and pragmatic camps in the government 
the pragmatic camp led by rafsanjani has sought improved ties 
with the west to help repair irans shattered economy the 
hardline camp believes opposition to the west especially the 
united states is a cornerstone of the 1979 islamic revolution 
but western diplomats in tehran interviewed after the earthquake 
said quake relief could be an important lever for rafsanjani in his 
quest to free more hostages 
the government wants to solve this crisis one european 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity they are trying to find 
a way out by making a distinction between the european and american 
hostages 
he said that focusing on the large amount of earthquake aid sent 
by european nations to iran would help silence domestic opposition 
to making conciliatory gestures toward the west 
it could be a way of solving the problem internally the 
diplomat said 
when polhill and reed were released earlier this year the first 
word came from irna in a short dispatch worded similarly to 
saturdays 
at that time iran said it would work for the release of other 
hostages in return for help in gaining freedom for 300 moslem 
prisoners mostly lebanese shiites held at an israeli detention 
camp in south lebanon 
the inmates are accused of involvement in underground warfare 
against israeli troops and allied militiamen of the south lebanon 
army who control a border strip in south lebanon 
iran also has demanded that western governments help shed light 
on the fate of four iranians who were kidnapped in 1982 by a 
rightwing lebanese christian militia in north lebanon

prevent black majority rule 
mandela was addressing a public rally in ugandas capital of 
kampala on the third day of his visit to this east african nation 
during an international tour 
we know that there are many whites who are armed and

responsible for a series of six bombings in south african cities 
last week

black bus terminal inuring 27 people 
white extremists claimed responsibility for five blasts but 
there was no claim of responsibility for fridays bombing 
mandela who arrived here thursday accompanied by his wife 
winnie shared the platform with presidents yoweri museveni of 
uganda robert mugabe of zimbabwe and joachim chissano of 
mozambique 
mandela said his organization the leading group opposing white 
rule in south africa will strive in forthcoming talks with the 
government to create a constitution ending the apartheid system 
the policy of legal racial discrimination 
we will ensure that every person has the right to vote and 
serve in all organs of the government he said 
mugabe told the cheering crowd the visit had given the four 
leaders an opportunity to discuss measures that could hasten the 
end of apartheid in south africa he said they would present the 
ideas to the annual organization of african unity summit starting 
monday in addis ababa ethiopia

more than 170 wildfires still raged 
across alaska on saturday and fire officials expressed concern the 
blazes could threaten small towns for weeks 
hot dry weather in tandem with thousands of firecausing 
lightning strikes is making the summer fire season much worse 
than years past said pete buist a spokesman for an interagency 
fire information center at fairbanks 
in a more typical summer tundra and forests would be wetter 
humidity higher and most fires would be monitored but not 
aggressively fought he said but under the weather conditions we 
have now we start manning fires that we would not ordinarily 
unlike other western states where policies to let fires burn 
have been criticized alaska fire managers typically allow most 
wildfires to burn because they seldom pose a risk to people or 
property 
no lives or homes have been lost to alaska fires this year 
authorities said but massive fires across the state are burning 
nearer to villages than usual 
throughout alaska some 2400 firefighters were battling fires 
consuming more than 280225 acres in a wide eastwest band across 
the flat tundra and black spruce forests of the sparsely populated 
interior 
the most critical blaze was the 47000acre fire near tok at 
its worst on thursday it burned to within a quartermile of the 
crossroads village on the alaska highway 260 miles northeast of 
anchorage 
firefighters on saturday took advantage of a second consecutive 
day of overcast skies 30 percent humidity and temperatures in the 
60s to battle the blaze 
rob mcwhorter a bureau of land management spokesman at tok 
said about 400 firefighters would continue to defend the village of 
about 1000 people even though the fire posed no danger for now 
the fire is not a direct threat mcwhorter said saturday 
but the joker in the deck really is this cloud cover because 
were told that thunderstorms are imbedded in it 
mcwhorter said that could create gusting erratic winds that 
could blow the fire near town again 
the other serious fires included the 910acre pedro dome fire 
15 miles northeast of fairbanks the cassiar creek fire about 50 
miles north of fairbanks at 2500 acres a 33000acre blaze near 
the village of beaver about 100 miles north of fairbanks and a 
27000acre fire touched off by lightning within denali national 
park

harrahs headliner room one of the last 
bastions of bigname entertainment in reno will become a 
cabaretlounge next year featuring a nightly revue 
ronald s jeffrey senior vice president and general manager of 
harrahs reno announce the change friday saying the planned 
conversion of the 24yearold showroom into an intimate 
nightclub in december was a response to a changing entertainment 
scene 
the increasing cost of paying for topname entertainers and the 
difficulty of finding those who will perform two shows nightly 
influenced the decision jeffrey said 
the headliner room opened with eddie fisher as its top act in 
1966 and featured such stars as sammy davis jr danny thomas 
patti page and bill cosby during its heyday 
after its conversion the room will stay roughly the same size 
seating 400 to 450 people 
the loss of the headliner room will leave the reno area with 
only three stages designed for topname acts ballys the sparks 
nugget and the flamingo hilton

the internal revenue service had been 
examining the records of mitch snyder for a year prior to his 
apparent suicide last week an attorney for the homeless advocate 
said saturday 
the attorney gerald a kafka said the irs stepped in about 
a year ago to audit royalties paid to snyder from the 1986 
television movie samaritan the mitch snyder story snyder was 
a consultant on the film 
the irs was examining civilly mitchs tax liability for prior 
years it was the audit of any taxpayer and the irs wasnt 
handling it any differently kafka said in a telephone interview 
ellen murphy director of public affairs for the irs said 
saturday the agency was proibited from commenting 
the body of snyder 46 was found hanging by an electrical cord 
thursday in his bedroom at the community for creative nonviolence 
the washington homeless shelter he ran 
authorities said snyder apparently had killed himself one or two 
days earlier kafka said he had scheduled a meeting with snyder for 
last tuesday evening to wrap up the irs situation but he 
didnt make the meeting 
police found a note near snyders body in which he talked about 
problems with his relationship with carol fennelly his longtime 
companion and coworker at the shelter the two had planned to 
marry in september 
fennelly was scheduled for admission to capitol hill hospital 
after she collapsed outside the ccnv shelter during a meeting of 
the homeless advocacy group on saturday hospital spokeswoman lisa 
poulter said doctors advised fennelly be admitted for observation 
but she decided to leave 
police sources last week who described the note did not say if 
it mntioned any difficulties with the irs 
snyder had refused for philosophical reasons to incorporate 
his shelter as a taxexempt group kafka would not say whether 
snyder had refused to pay taxes 
its safe to say mitch was very consistent in his treatment of 
taxes kafka said 
mitch did not gain any economic advantage from the movie 
the attorney said the money went straight to ccnv 
according to a report in saturday editions of the new york 
times snyder told coworkers six weeks ago about the audit 
members of the district of columbia city council had criticized 
snyder for failing to apply officially for nonprofit status 
council members complained that snyders group received 360000 a 
year in free utilities for which the city could not be reimbursed 
because of the shelters refusal to seek official status 
taxexempt status limits the ability of an organization to 
engage in political activity snyder had been known for his 
political activism and he had been highly critical of the citys 
management of its homeless program

state television broadcast footage of a 
purported 1980 meeting between an international terrorist and 
agents of the old communist regime bolstering claims the exrulers 
let terrorists use hungary as a base 
a former communist official interviewed on the same program 
claimed the communists had tried to oust carlos as soon as they 
discovered he was operating in the country 
the footage purportedly showed agents of the old regime trying 
to persuade the international terrorist carlos to leave hungary 
the nations communist party disbanded in october 
however it appeared to back up allegations made three weeks ago 
that hungarys former communist leaders had allowed carlos to use 
the country at least for a time as a base for terrorist attacks 
the report did not indicate how long carlos also known as the 
jackal allegedly stayed in hungary 
carlos a moscow university graduate began his life as a 
terrorist in 1973 and topped interpols mostwanted list by 1975 
in december of that year he allegedly organized an attack in 
vienna on opec oil ministers in which three people were killed 
carlos remains at large 
state television said the meeting shown in the film took place 
in 1980 in an office of the interior ministrys department for the 
supervision of foreigners and was filmed without carloss knowledge 
there was no indication of how the film was obtained 
interior minister balazs horvath said on june 27 that he had 
instructed the chief prosecutor to investigate former communist 
party officials who allegedly provided shelter and training grounds 
for carlos whose real name is ilich ramirez sanchez and his 
terrorist group 
the man identified as carlos in the film spoke fluent but 
accented english 
the two hungarian agents spoke hungarian among themselves and 
english to carlos the conversation was poorly recorded and 
difficult to make out at times so the film was subtitled 
one agent told carlos that he must liquidate your base of 
operations here must stop using hungary from where to direct your 
group because there is danger your operations may be compromised 
also if you were to continue the interests of the hungarian 
peoples republic may be jeopardized if you are associated with 
us 
you can travel through hungary or even stay for brief 
periods the hungarian official told carlos trying to mollify 
him 
andras petresevics one of the agents said in an interview on 
the program that the terrorist accused him of being an 
imperialist agent and of acting without the knowledge of his 
superiors to get him to leave 
the former communist chief of counterintelligence miklos redei 
also was interviewed in the program redei who also met carlos 
said he gave the impression of being paranoid afraid but he 
was not dumb 
horvath speaking about the case last month said recently 
discovered documents implicated the late communist party leader 
janos kadar former interior minister andras benkei former 
president karoly nemeth and antal gyenes former head of the 
communist partys foreign relations department 
one of the documents produced by horvath was a letter allegedly 
written to kadar by carlos in 1980 the same year the terrorist 
apparently left hungry 
from our base in hungary we have developed our international 
ties getting in contact with the revolutions of every nation 
without any hindrance on the part of the hungarian authorities 
the letter purportedly said 
benkei nemeth and gyenes have denied any role in sheltering 
terrorists 
redei asserted that a small group of terrorists led by carlos 
did not come here at the invitation of any hungarian official we 
tried to keep tabs on them after their arrival 
redei denied carlos was provided with any training facilities in 
hungary 
he said fear of the terrorist kept hungarian authorities from 
acting against him we knew that if we do anything to him 
his group would take revenge

from the sugar fields of cuba to the shores of 
the kurile islands the ghost of josef stalin is haunting mikhail 
gorbachevs effort to win economic aid from the west 
with gorbachevs survival at stake western nations are flirting 
with a 15 billion economic aid package to moscow an issue that 
is likely to dominate the economic summit of industrialized nations 
that begins here on monday 
bush received a recent message from gorbachev and it was learned 
saturday that the soviet leader made his case for us assistance 
it was virtually the same request that gorbachev conveyed within 
the last two weeks to leaders of west germany and france 
west germany france and italy are eager to proceed but 
gorbachev may have to reverse decadesold soviet policy before the 
united states and japan will go along no one is expecting a 
consensus from this summit 
the sticking points for the united states soviet assistance to 
cuba and modernization of the red army 
for japan four kurile islands seized by stalin after world war 
ii 
after ridiculing the notion earlier in the year president bush 
seems to be slowly setting the stage for direct american aid to 
moscow but it isnt going to happen now he indicated on friday 
i have some big problems with that one and i think the 
american people do too president bush told reporters after the 
nato summit in london he said commercial trade credits might be 
possible but that the united states will not provide direct aid so 
long as the soviet union sends 5 billion a year to prop up the 
cuban economy 
perhaps more importantly bush also urged gorbachev to scale 
back the percentage of soviet spending devoted to the military 
secretary of state james a baker iii says moscow has been spending 
between 18 and 25 percent of its economy on military expansion 
which in the past has been hostile to the united states 
baker also said we really ought to see some progress toward 
economic reforms before sending american taxpayer funds to 
moscow we ought to have some faith that the money will be well 
spent he told cnn 
one obstacle dates back past stalin to the czarist days it is a 
legal restriction on credit to the soviet union based on 
prerevolutionary debt of several hundred million dollars 
on cuba bush is stating an american political reality the 
united states isnt going to subsidize moscow so that moscow can 
subsidize cuba 
soviet economic aid to cuba is estimated by us officials at 
more than 4 billion a year mostly in the form of subsidies for 
cuban exports such as sugar cuba receives an additional 15 
billion in military aid according to us figures 
aidtocuba is already the subject of heated debate in moscow 
where some argue that it would be wrong to turn on an ally under 
threat from the united states others say the kremlin cannot 
justify a largescale aid program at a time of economic decline at 
home 
japan is joining bush in using the economic aid question as a 
wedge to reverse longheld soviet policies the japanese are 
keeping their prodigious wallets zipped pending the outcome of a 
peace treaty that involves the kurile chain of islands 
in an interview shortly before leaving for houston japanese 
prime minister toshiki kaifu said it was soviet expansionism at 
the end of world war ii that prompted stalin to seize four of the 
kurile islands from japan 
he told the new york times that economic aid to gorbachev will 
not be possible until the northern territories conflict is 
resolved despite warming relations between japan and the soviet 
union a resolution will be none too simple since the islands 
etorofu kunashira shikotan and habomai are not the only or even 
the most prominent territories seized by stalin 
while japan is playing hardball on aid to moscow kaifu also is 
carrying the torch for resumption of western aid to china its 
possible japan will lift its sanctions against china even if the 
other summit nations do not bush allowed as much on saturday 
saying sometimes there are interests that predominate 
japan sees china as a huge and natural market and is anxious to 
proceed with a 5 billion aid package 
west germanys effort to win aid for moscow also seems to have a 
selfserving edge 
the communist party daily pravda said in a recent commentary 
that bonn was trying to grease the way for soviet approval of 
the key tenets of german unification 
despite his best efforts west german chancellor helmut kohl 
says the issue may not come to a head until the end of the year 
we are not under time pressure he told reporters in london 
on friday 
not under time pressure gorbachev said last week that if the 
soviet economy isnt awakening within two years hell give way 
with the ghost of stalin still complicating international affairs 
no one in the west is eager for that to happen

where the international economic summit will begin monday 
police made a few arrests but there was no serious trouble at 
the twohour protest 
charles lee the texas kkk grand dragon led klansmen in 
chanting no economic summit and bush should not negotiate 
with foreign countries 
the klansmen arrived in school buses carrying banners saying 
stop colored immigration and began their rally with a prayer 
by a minister from the aryan nation church 
demonstrators interrupted the klans activities with chants 
as the rally winded down one protestor travis morales who 
heads the revolutionary communist party was arrested along with 
two other antiklan demonstrators as they burned an american flag 
police said 
ktbctv cameraman andrew sowder of austin and associated press 
photographer greg gibson were arrested for crossing the police 
line police later released the two after ticketing them for the 
misdemeanor 
about 15 klan supporters calling themselves skinheads 
marched in front of angry demonstrators before the klan arrived 
the antiklan contingent threw dog food at the skinheads shouting 
dog food for the dogs 
members of the aidsadvocacy group act up members of cure aids 
now students and youth against racism and the all peoples 
congress taunted the klansmen 
hundreds of police officers wore 50pound flak jackets and riot 
helmets in sweltering 90degree heat while standing between 
klansmen and demonstrators 
earlier on the steps of houstons city hall a group calling 
itself racial acceptance class equality or race sang songs and 
spoke out against racism to drown the messages of the klan rally 
the kkks rally is irrelevant said jim greenwood a houston 
city council member who spoke in support of race the kkk has 
nothing to do with anything real in houston today 
about 50 people attended the rally held by race which was 
founded last year as a voice for white people against racism but 
now includes members from various ethnic backgrounds it was the 
first public demonstration by the group race president sue lloyd 
said 
we want to stress to the world that houston is a diverse 
interesting place and while we are not perfect we are committed to 
racial harmony she said 
across the street more than 400 vietnamese from across the 
country carried signs and chanted in support for human rights in 
their native land 
some of the 30 banners painted in the red and yellow of the 
vietnamese flag included slogans like freedom for vietnam and 
dont support the hanoi regime 
hang nguyen diep an organizer of the rally said the vietnamese 
were attempting to gather support from the world leaders attending

western leaders gathering for backtoback 
summits shifted continents saturday to take up a series of tough 
economic issues and mull the encouraging reaction from moscow to 
changes in the nato military alliance 
president bush welcomed his guests in the sweltering heat of his 
adopted hometown and met over a presummit lunch with toshiki 
kaifu the prime minister of japan 
their discussions touched on several of the most difficult 
issues that would arise monday when the formal summit meetings 
begin aid to moscow loans to china and trade among the allies 
themselves bush hinted that he wouldnt try to block kaifus 
intention to resume economic aid to china 
the prospering allies were trying to map a coordinated strategy 
to deal with the breakup of the communist bloc the 16th annual 
economic summit meeting is the first held in america since a 
gathering in williamsburg va in 1983 
a decision on sending aid to moscow was not expected to emerge 
this week but the climate was growing more hospitable and bushs 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the summit leaders there 
are a lot of things they can consider short of direct aid 
bush told kaifu according to fitzwater that he was very 
pleased with the reaction of the soviet union to the nato summit 
we have read the reports of comments by president gorbachev as well 
as foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and we are very pleased 
that they believe that the nato summit has been productive and 
helpful 
fitzwater disclosed that bush sent mikhail gorbachev a cable 
friday from air force one giving bushs personal reflections on 
the nato summit and describing the changing nature of the 
military alliance 
previously gorbachev wrote bush to make his case for us 
economic aid us sources said the message was much the same as 
one gorbachev advanced recently to the leaders of west germany and 
france 
the bushkaifu meeting also touched on american domestic 
policies with the japanese leader praising bush for newfound 
willingness to consider tax increases in order to reduce americas 
budget deficit a japanese official said 
we believe the statement issued by president bush on june 26 
was very courageous taizo watanabe spokesman for the japanese 
finance ministry told reporters 
the federal budget deficits have long been a sore point with 
other summit countries who contend that excessive american 
borrowing needs have driven up worldwide interest rates 
in addition to the united states and japan the other countries 
at the economic summit are west germany britian france italy and 
canada 
the world leaders were not spending all of their time discussing 
serious subjects bush was treating the summit leaders to a 
countrystyle barbecue rodeo and performance by the grand ole opry 
on sunday 
the city of houston anxious to show the world that it had 
rebounded after being flattened by the oil bust of 1982 raised 10 
million in donations and turned out an army of volunteers to assist 
visiting dignitaries and reporters 
last years economic summit was held in paris as part of the 
200th anniversary of the french revolution while houston boosters 
conceded that the houston summit would not top that affair they 
did try their best providing a texassyle welcome for each leader 
kaifu the first to arrive was greeted by a group of 
schoolchildren singing deep in the heart of texas in 
japanese with temperatures in the 90s and oppressive humidity 
kaifu and the other leaders had no trouble knowing they had arrived 
in houston 
before the start of his meeting with kaifu bush was asked 
whether he planned to pressure the japanese leader to drop his push 
to resume development loans to china this assistance was put on 
hold by agreement of the summit countries last year in paris in 
response to the brutal crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in 
tiananmen square 
bush indicated that the summit countries are likely to abandon 
their united front providing japan the opportunity to pursue its 
own lending policy 
japan bush said is a sovereign nation they can make up 
their own minds on a lot of questions 
the goitseparately approach was also likely to prevail on the 
contentious question over whether to provide direct economic aid to 
the soviet union west germany has already announced it will 
provide 31 billion in loans and economic assistance 
west germany france and italy have been pushing the allies to 
endorse a 15 billion economic aid package to bail out the 
floundering soviet economy but the united states and britain 
opposed providing direct economic aid until the soviets made a 
bolder move toward a freemarket economy and stopped siphoning 
large amounts of its resources into the military and support for 
cuba 
japan has its own special problem with soviet aid contending 
japanese assistance would be impossible until moscow has settled a 
45yearold territorial dispute over four islands north of japan 
that have been occupied by the soviet union since world war ii 
secretary of state james a baker iii said saturday that the 
summit scheduled to run from monday through wednesday was likely 
to conclude without a common position on soviet aid 
baker for the first time saturday discussed publicly a new us 
proposal to establish a multibilliondollar international aid 
program for latin america 
while details of the plan are sketchy it would be modeled after 
the economic aid package being offered to emerging democracies in 
eastern europe with the assistance coming from the same group of 24 
nations who are providing aid to eastern europe 
the latin american aid would be another effort by the bush 
administration to reassure new democratic governments in this 
hemisphere that they will not be overlooked in the rush to help 
eastern europe 
the united states received a warning saturday from an official 
of the 12nation european community that its heavy lobbying on 
elimination of farm subsidies could be counterproductive 
the united states is in a battle with european countries over a 
us proposal to phase out expensive farm subsidies over the next 
decade europeans contend that the request could cost the jobs of 
between 2 million and 3 million lessefficient european farmers 
bush has made resolution of the farm dispute a top priority for 
the houston summit believing that agreement in this area is 
crucial to the successful conclusion of 97nation effort to 
overhaul the entire world trading system those talks known as the 
uruguay round are scheduled to conclude in december

the bush administration will not object if japan 
resumes aid to china despite continued us economic sanctions in 
reprisal for beijings crushing of the prodemocracy revolt the 
white house said saturday 
president bush was not prepared to enter a multinational 
aidtochina agreement but was willing to discuss the matter 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said he said bush wanted to hear 
japans explanation of why it plans a 52 billion loan package to 
its giant neighbor 
a japanese spokesman said bush did not react negatively when 
prime minister toshiki kaifu raised that matter during their 
meeting saturday 
japan already is doing preparatory work on the loan it 
suspended after chinas crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
last year japanese foreign ministry press secretary taizo watanabe 
said saturday 
contrary to earlier reports he said it is not on our mind 
to push for other summit countries to similarly aid china 
bush hosting the summit of wealthy industrialized nations 
beginning here monday told reporters that japan is a sovereign 
nation that can make up its own mind on a lot of questions 
he was replying to a reporters question on whether he would urge 
kaifu to refrain from resuming aid to china 
they work very cooperatively with the united states but 
sometimes they have interests that predominate bush said before 
going to his meeting and luncheon with kaifu 
most noncommunist nations imposed sanctions on beijing after 
the brutal crackdown in tiananmen square last year against hundreds 
of thousands of prodemocracy demonstrators 
however bush has backed away from a totally hard line on the 
china question sending high level emissaries to begin opening the 
way to eventual renewed relations easing some parts of the 
sanctions and stating that he does not believe such an important 
geopolitical giant should be isolated 
later fitzwater was asked about whether bush would try to 
dissuade kaifu from going ahead with renewed aid to china 
he replied no well listen to their discussion and see what 
their interests are 
asked specifically whether bush objected to other countries 
resuming aid to china he said were willing to discuss it 
thats what this summit is all about 
as to why bush wouldnt pressure japan or other countries to 
hold firm against china given the administrations official 
position that china must show progress on human rights and 
political freedom fitzwater told reporters we do have concerns 
about multilateral lending in china on the other hand various 
countries have other interests that are outside the multilateral 
area were willing to talk about that we are not looking to 
change our position but were willing to discuss the matter we 
are concerned about china and not isolating that country but i 
dont anticipate any change 
meanwhile the chinese communist party chief said the leaders of 
the seven industrialized powers should avoid meddling in chinas 
internal affairs at their annual economic summit 
jiang zemin said the group of seven should confine themselves 
to discussion of economic and other issues among themselves the 
official xinhua news agency said in a report saturday that it said 
paraphrased his remarks 
regardless of the reaction of other summit participants 
officials have indicated japan likely would go ahead with its own 
loan plan to beijing 
at last years summit in france the participants agreed on 
sanctions including a ban on highlevel contacts with chinese 
officials and a freeze on development loans 
japan has been chinas main source of credit and had planned 
52 billion in a fiveyear program of loans now kaifu and other 
japanese government officials say its time to open the credit 
window again to avoid isolating china or contributing to economic 
unrest there 
bush said he had a wide array of issues to discuss with 
kaifu 
the included economic and trade issues and the ongoing uruguay 
round of trade talks as well as environmental and agricultural 
issues the two countries concluded this year an agreement on 
thorny trade talks designed to correct the massive us trade 
deficit with japan the idea would be to reform institutional 
economic practices that make it harder for us interests to 
compete in japan 
bush and his wife barbara later took kaifu to a houston 
production of rodgers and hammersteins carousel 
the musical was added to bushs summitweek activities after 
members of the citys host committee insisted that the cultural 
side of the city be highlighted the centerpiece social activity 
before this weeks addition of the carousel show at the wortham 
theater center had been the sunday nights rodeo barbecue and grand 
ole opry performance 
bushs attendance at the houston grand opera performance of 
carousel shows that houston is a city of wide cultural 
diversity said peter roussel spokesman for the houston host 
committee 
the performance was to have closed last week but was extended 
with three performances this weekend

the official vatican newspaper saturday 
assailed a righttodie bill passed by the new york state 
legislature this month 
losservatore romano in a frontpage editorial said the 
catholic church denounces the alliance that man makes today with 
death 
it called such laws simple acts of tragic stupidity 
the newspaper did not specifically mention new york but clearly 
alluded to the legislation approved earlier this month in albany 
the bill allows the sick to appoint proxies to make healthcare 
decisions for them when they are no longer able to do so the 
ruling opens the possibility of a proxy deciding that an 
incapacitated person should be allowed to die 
the legislation was passed after the us supreme court ruled 
that a missouri woman in an irreversible coma could not be 
disconnected from lifesupport equipment because it was unclear 
what her wishes would have been 
new york gov mario cuomo a roman catholic has not yet signed 
the bill into law but is expected to do so 
abortion and euthanasia express the same idea that human life 
belongs exclusively to man and that everyone is the exclusive owner 
of his life the editorial said 
the newspaper said only god had the right to terminate life 
if even the people who are asked to wisely govern the human 
community have fallen into such blackness as to promulgate such 
antihuman laws the culture and mentality of the end of the 
century have lost their sense of authentic values the editorial 
said 
in a lastminute concession aimed at avoiding the active 
opposition of new york states roman catholic bishops legislators 
said private hospitals could refuse for moral or religious 
reasons to carry out a proxy order to end life support 
the hospital would however have to inform the patient upon 
admission that it would not honor a proxys decision

a prominent state legislator has been 
convicted of conspiracy for inducing a former prison mate to invest 
in an illegal bingo operation then fleecing him of half the money 
a 12member jury convicted state rep tommy burnett on friday of 
nine conspiracy counts that carry a possible prison term of 45 
yearsno sentencing date was set by us district judge thomas a 
higgins 
two codefendants columbia businessman ee shutt and knoxville 
bingo operator virginia hurst were convicted on charges of 
conspiracy and operating a gambling enterprise 
burnett faces trial sept 11 on a related perjury charge 
the convictions were the first to result from a joint 
federalstate corruption probe that has produced indictments 
against 43 people including a former state representative an 
election commissioner a bingo regulator and various bingo 
operators 
the investigation has centered on misuse of profits from bingo 
which had been permitted in the state only to benefit charities 
and was made illegal altogether in 1989 partly as a result of the 
investigation 
while burnett was serving 10 months of a federal prison sentence 
in 1984 the indictment charged he convinced fellow inmate joseph 
cappello of naples fla to invest 48000 in the operation of a 
crossville bingo home 
burnett hurst and shutt created the columbia scholarship fund 
as a nonprofit charter to run the bingo hall in 1985 after 
burnett left prison but the hall operated only briefly and 
burnett made private use of about half of cappellos investment 
according to testimony 
burnett the oncepowerful majority leader in the state house of 
representatives apparently will lose his seat as a result of the 
conviction felons are barred from the office 
the 10term legislator was reelected in 1984 from the federal 
prison camp in alabama where he was sent for failing to file 
timely income tax returns 
burnett earned a reputation early in his career as a powerful 
speaker and champion of sometimes unpopular causes he once 
presented an eloquent attack on tennessees death penalty 
after the tax conviction which plea bargaining reduced to a 
misdemeanor burnett surrendered the party leadership and became a 
mediator helping forge compromise on such issues as education 
reform 
all good things must come to an end and perhaps this is the 
end of it i dont know burnett said after the conviction friday 
burnett said he would not seek reelection but that he hadnt 
decided whether he would resign he had previously filed for 
reelection and has two opponents in the august primary 
i wish id never taken a look at bingo obviously burnett 
said hindsight is 2020

an insurance company is refusing to 
pay a 2 million life insurance claim to the survivor of an aids 
victim saying the victim used someone elses blood to qualify for 
coverage 
lawyers for massachusetts general life insurance co want a 
federal judge in fort lauderdale to throw out the 2 million claim 
by anthony c fioretti who died of aids on feb 28 1989 in 
broward county 
fioretti 40 tested positive for the hiv virus and was rejected 
by another insurance company less than a month before virusfree 
blood was used in his application to massachusetts general the 
lawyers say 
the person submitting blood for hiv testing on june 29 1987 
was not in fact fioretti but represented himself and his blood 
sample to be that of fioretti the suit says 
fioretti also used the name finetti on the application to 
make it more difficult for insurance investigators to discover 
through national computer records he had previously tested positive 
for aids the suit says 
despite the proliferation of aids cases nationwide the 
massachusetts general lawsuit is one of only a handful of cases 
filed in federal court involving aids victims accused of trying to 
enrich survivors through fraudulent insurance claims according to 
a report in saturdays sunsentinel of fort lauderdale 
fioretti a former new york city florist had been paying 
30365 per year in premiums to maintain his 2 million insurance 
coverage since july 1987 the sole beneficiary was listed as 
fiorettis brother vincent of plantation who has an unlisted 
phone number and could not be located for comment 
last month fort lauderdale attorney steven fine filed suit on 
behalf of vincent fioretti to force massachusetts general to pay 
the 2 million claim calls to fines office went unanswered 
saturday 
mark f hughes jr an attorney for massachusetts general in 
newark nj said the company in accordance with insurance laws 
has offered to refund fiorettis premium payments with interest 
to his brother the offer was rejected he said 
hughes said the insurance company has filed a countersuit in 
federal court in new york city where the blood tests were 
performed asking the court to dismiss fiorettis claim 
how do we know that an imposter submitted the blood hughes 
asked rhetorically we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
fioretti died of aids we know that aids does not kill you 
immediately so he had to have had it before his death and we know 
that in january 1987 his blood tested positive for hiv 
if the company knew he had the aids virus massachusetts general 
would have never issued the policy he said the suit argues that 
because of alleged fraudulent acts by fioretti his application was 
void before it was accepted

the soviet circus stranded outside atlanta since 
may has filed for protection from its creditors under us 
bankruptcy laws 
the great circus bim bom filed for chapter 11 protection friday 
in bankruptcy court in atlanta said lawyer richard keck who is 
donating his services 
the circus named for two turnofthecentury russian clowns 
has been stranded in marietta northwest of atlanta when its 
planned twoyear goodwill tour of the united states was canceled 
after investors withdrew support 
circus members have been forced to live on charity unable to 
restart their tour because they cant pay the companies holding 
their performing animals costumes and equipment they blame a 
florida company international showbusiness inc for improperly 
managing their tour 
the bankruptcy action would consolidate claims and lawsuits 
against the circus so it can straighten out its finances keck 
said two lawsuits have been filed against the circus in new york 
and georgia by the equipment companies he said 
instead of having to defend it on a lot of battlefronts this 
consolidates it down to one keck said 
the situation right now is very optimistic for us said 
circus managing director yuri turkin 
about 70 circus members remain in the atlanta area some 30 
others stayed with international showbusiness and traveled to west 
virginia to look for work

the united states is willing to 
consider a role for afghanistans sovietbacked leader in a 
settlement to end the nations 10yearold war diplomatic sources 
said saturday 
diplomatic formulas recently drafted by washington could provide 
the united states and the soviet union with a facesaving exit from 
war between moslem rebels and the afghan government the sources 
said 
the options include what a year ago would have been out of the 
question for the united states allowing president najibullah to 
remain in office while transferring control of the armed forces 
the intelligence agencies and the staterun media to a broadbased 
interim council the sources said 
the options also include internationally supervised elections 
and a cutoff of weapons supplied by the united states to the rebels 
and by the soviet union to the government in kabul 
the proposed compromise comes as the soviet union is tiring of 
its costly involvement in afghanistan and the united states 
becoming increasingly frustrated by internal bickering that has 
sapped the moslem resistance of its political and military cohesion 
we believe the soviets are seriously interested in reaching a 
political solution we certainly are so there are a lot of forces 
moving and we have made a lot of progress said a senior us 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
although the mechanics have yet to be worked out the emergence 
of independent afghan groups could provide the springboard for an 
interim council 
the council would most likely include najibullahs ruling 
hezbewatan or party of the homeland which until last month had 
been known for a quarter century as the peoples democratic party 
of afghanistan 
the major obstacle to a settlement has been najibullah the 
44yearold ruler and former head of the feared afghan secret 
police who has been trying to distance himself and his party from 
the communist past 
until recently washington had insisted that najibullah and 
less than a planeload of people had to leave but najibullah 
has proven a formidable politician and refused to step aside 
moscow has said it cannot remove him 
he can stay and sign the checks he can call himself by 
whatever title he wishes he can run in an election and if he wins 
he can return to power said one western diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he just cant have the advantages of incumbency control of 
the military the police and the media before or during an 
election because he would probably cheat the diplomat said 
rebel leaders said thay have been informed of the us proposal 
if najib stays as president if only in title then 
symbolically and psychologically he has won said one guerrilla 
leader also speaking on condition of anonymity but if the 
soviets and the americans come to any agreement then its 
settled 
when the last soviet soldiers left afghanistan in february 1989 
after nine years of direct involvement western leaders confidently 
predicted that the government would quickly fall and the resistance 
would take command 
however neither side has achieved any significant military 
victory government troops control the cities and the guerrillas 
remain in control of the countryside

two lutheran pastors and their 
congregations went on trial before an ecclesiastical panel saturday 
for defying church rules and ordaining a gay man and a lesbian 
couple 
the hearing the first of its kind for the fledgling evangelical 
lutheran church in america could result in the expulsion of the 
local churches from the 53 millionmember denomination 
but the rev john frykman of first united lutheran church and 
the rev james delange of st francis lutheran church say they and 
their flocks are willing to be ousted to prove their support of the 
civil and religious rights of homosexuals 
gays and lesbians are the largest oppressed minority in this 
country frykman said the church for too long has betrayed gay 
and lesbian people and forced them to live as alienated people 
the threeday hearing before a 14member committee marks the 
first time the evangelical lutheran church in america has sought to 
discipline a pastor or congregation church officials said the 
church was formed in a merger of three major lutheran groups in 
january 1988 
the panel on monday may impose a penalty ranging from censure to 
suspension to expulsion 
that is a very painful kind of possibility to contemplate 
said sierra pacific synod bishop lyle miller who heads the church 
in northern california 
the evangelical lutheran church in america like most other 
mainstream churches forbids the ordination of sexually active gay 
men and lesbians 
we have standards for the ordained and one of them is that 
sexual activity is only to be practiced within the bonds of 
marriage said charles ruthroff millers assistant 
miller filed the charges against st francis and first united 
after jeff johnson ruth frost and phyllis zillhart were anointed 
messengers of jesus christ and installed as assistant pastors 
in january the three who were grand marshals in last months gay 
and lesbian freedom day parade had refused to take a church vow of 
celibacy 
johnson 28 is assistant pastor of united lutheran a 
predominantly heterosexual congregation of about 100 in the citys 
richmond district frost 42 and zillhart 32 a couple for five 
years are at st francis a largely gay congregation in the castro 
district 
at a news conference friday the two pastors and their 
assistants said they in turn would put the evangelical lutheran 
church in america on trial for violating its own promise to be 
inclusive to work for social justice and fight oppression 
frykman recalling how his church was founded in the 16th 
century when martin luther broke away from the roman catholic 
church accused denomination leaders of acting like roman 
bishops in attempting to control ordinations 
delange said other lutheran churches here have adopted a 
resolution of support but that his congregation and frykmans did 
not intend to break away from the church 
we are not trying to lead an exodus he said we hope 
the disciplinary committee will dismiss charges but we are 
prepared to suffer the consequences 
church officials on the other hand said the two local churches 
were pursing the issue the wrong way 
we dont see this discipline process as a way to change the 
policies of the church said ruthroff the sierra pacific synod 
he added already has asked the national church council to 
reexamine the ordination of gay men and women 
thats how the guidelines for ordinations should be changed 
he said 
the prospect of the new lutheran church allowing the ordination 
of sexually active homosexuals has prompted a dozen congregations 
throughout the country to form a conservative great commission 
network to monitor liberal trends in the church

the bush administration will allow us 
commercial satellites to be launched on soviet rockets for the 
first time the new york times reported sunday 
an australian commercial venture the cape york space agency 
will be permitted to hire a us company to run a base in australia 
from which soviet rockets will carry satellites for customers from 
around the world the times reported 
the project which could be in operation by 1995 would provide 
a major opportunity for the soviet union to expand its 
international space business and would increase competitive 
pressures on the american rocket industry the times said 
the national space council an interagency committee headed by 
vice president dan quayle met last week and completed a broad set 
of recommendations on the international launching business the 
newspaper said quoting unnamed government and industry officials 
the times said the decision to approve the cape york project was 
among the thorniest issues involved in the councils policy 
review 
a spokesman for the space council declined to comment on the 
report saturday 
the newspaper said the state department intends to grant an 
export license to the usbi division of the united technologies 
corp to operate the cape york station where soviet zenit rockets 
could be launched 
the project estimated to cost nearly 500 million is backed by 
an australian real estate development company and would not receive 
any australian government funds the newspaper said the soviet 
space agency glavkosmos would supply rockets and engineers but 
would not own a share in the venture 
the times said australia and the soviet union would have to 
comply with conditions laid out by the united states including a 
soviet promise to limit its overseas launching to a single site and 
to abide by an international agreement controlling the export of 
ballistic missile technologies which have commercial and military 
uses 
us rocket manufacturers fear they will suffer unfairly in a 
headtohead competition with soviet suppliers 
but the paper said us satellite companies have warned that 
if they are prevented from putting their payloads on the cheapest 
available rockets they will lose business to foreign satellite 
makers

militiamen responded in kind with each side sending 
reinforcements he said the clash lasted for two hours 
the firefight came a few days after the plo harshly criticized 
hamas a fundamentalist organization active in the israelioccupied 
gaza strip the ansarullah faction closely identifies with hamas 
which has been challenging the proplo leadership of the 30month 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
the palestine althawra magazine mouthpiece of the plo 
launched the attack against hamas in a commentary in its latest 
edition 
the article accused hamas of trying to break away from the 
rules and regulations of the palestinian house 
the commentary said such attempts by hamas will only serve the 
intrigues of the zionist enemies and their american masters

military spending in a postcold war era as 
well as the fate of the b2 stealth bomber and osprey aircraft top 
the agenda this week as the senate finally begins working on a 1991 
defense budget 
white house and congressional negotiators still havent agreed 
on how to reduce the federal budget deficit by 50 billion for 
fiscal 1991 and that has delayed action on the 307billion 
military budget that president bush unveiled in january 
but the senate armed services committee has decided it can wait 
no longer committee members working behind closed doors will 
draw up a defense blueprint for full senate consideration just 
prior to the august recess 
in fact theyll be giving senators two different budgets to 
mull over 
committee chairman sen sam nunn dga said one bill will 
allocate 286 billion for defense the figure proposed by the 
senate budget committee the other will use nunns own budget range 
of 289 billion to 291 billion 
nunn said the process will be an educational effort that 
will show the difficulty in making the kinds of cuts lawmakers 
have called for since the collapse of the warsaw pact 
its a given on capitol hill that bushs 307 billion proposal 
will be cut the question is only by how much 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the panel 
said the 286 billion budget will prove that the only bank from 
which those dollars can flow would be unacceptable cuts in 
personnel and maintenance accounts 
in another break with tradition the senate armed services 
committee will craft defense legislation ahead of the house armed 
services committee 
the democratic leadership had wanted the house to complete a 
military budget before august but the house is behind schedule and 
probably wont even start working on a bill until september 
according to congressional sources who requested anonymity 
the house is behind in part because there still isnt 
agreement on an overall budget figure for the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 
but another factor the sources said is the trouble committee 
chairman rep les aspin dwis has had getting house members to 
let go of their pet defense issues and work on drafting a bill 
the major issue facing congress is the b2 stealth bomber the 
batwinged plane that according to the latest congressional budget 
office report will cost 860 million a copy 
faced with increasing budget constraints and a diminished soviet 
threat to the west defense secretary dick cheney has suggested 
buying only 75 stealth bombers instead of 132 
he also suggested buying only two of the bombers in fiscal 1991 
instead of five but the air force has told congress that buying 
three fewer bombers would only save about 900 million of the 55 
billion for the b2 program 
the sticker price is driving that decision warner said in 
an interview last week 
in the house sponsors of a bill to kill the program after the 
15 planes now in production say they are just a handful of votes 
away from approval 
not yet but were close real close said rep john 
rowland rconn a member of the house armed services committee 
rowland acknowledged that he faces a formidable task because 
northrop corp the bombers manufacturer is lobbying hard to keep 
it and the air force is willing to give up the oncecrucial mx 
nuclear missile on railroad cars in exchange for the b2 
on the senate side nunn and warner remain strong supporters of 
the stealth bomber and comparable legislation to kill the program 
has not made significant progress 
support has increased however for the v22 osprey the 
tiltrotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and can fly 
like a plane cheney wants to cancel the 27 billion program 
arguing that a mix of helicopters is cheaper than building the 
osprey 
but lawmakers from texas and pennsylvania where the aircraft is 
built have touted a recent internal pentagon report that says the 
osprey is costeffective 
warner also said that as the nation turns its attention from 
weapons used to fight the soviet union and focuses on limited 
conflicts and third world threats thats where the v22 has begun 
to gain added significance 
elsewhere on capitol hill this week congressional budget 
negotiators plan to meet with white house counterparts in search of 
an agreement to cut the federal budget deficit 
agreement has been elusive after nearly two months of talks but 
the bargaining intensified after bush eased his position against 
taxes on june 26 saying he now believes they must be included in 
any budget pact 
the senate also is expected to approve an omnibus crime bill 
that calls for curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons plus 
capital punishment for 30 federal crimes ranging from presidential 
assassination to espionage 
one possible amendment to the bill is a controversial plan that 
would allow private citizens frustrated by the pace of prosecution 
in the 325 billion savings and loan mess to sue alleged defrauders 
and pocket some of the damages

alan greenspan looks for zeros as patiently as a 
guy with a handful of quarters stationed in front of a slot 
machine but the combination he wants just doesnt come up 
greenspan wants zero inflation in the american economy and he 
is willing to battle the odds and take big risks in order to get 
it a lot of people think hell bust the economy in seeking that 
goal 
so be it chairman greenspan seems to say contending that if 
inflation isnt drawn out of the economy now it will simply 
reappear and scuttle the next economic advance deny it fuel 
suffocate the fires 
as head of the federal reserve board greenspan is effectively 
in charge of monetary policy his hands control the money supply 
the fuel and by keeping a firm hand on those levers he can force 
his will on the economy 
that is in pursuit of zero inflation he can slow the economy to 
the point where consumer willingness and ability to buy will 
diminish where producers will cut output where borrowing and 
lending will wane 
the big risk in seeking zero inflation is recession and many 
relatively wellinformed people think the economy is on the brink 
of it gross national product is barely growing job growth is down 
sharply manufacturing is weak 
true the service sector as opposed to the goodsproducing 
sector shows a moderate amount of vitality but those who worry 
about inflation observe that this same sector is where prices are 
still continuing to rise 
nobody really wants to see an economy declining everyone 
benefits from an economy that grows without inflation but too 
often greenspan supporters say growth has been diminished and 
then halted by inflation 
broadly speaking those who support the chairman in his war on 
inflation who encourage him to hold fast against pressures to 
lower interest rates which would spur economic activity have 
some solid grounds for so thinking 
in their view the coals of demandpull inflation still smolder 
that type of inflation occurs when easy money allows people to 
demand goods and services at a rate that cannot be sustained 
eventually the glowing coals flame up 
the zero inflationists believe the country may not be able to 
stand such an excess of activity given its inability to solve 
existing debt problems a consequence it should be noted of 
earlier excesses 
among the existing excesses are the federal budget deficit a 
consequence of excessive government spending the foreign trade 
deficit municipal and state debt taxpayer debt incurred in 
collapses of savings and loans unpaid foreign debt to us banks 
high mortgage debt real estate development debt consumer 
installment debt 
lets get some of the excesses reduced before we try another 
expansion say fed defenders but what appears to be a growing 
number of critics contends that in waiting for that time the fed 
might waste the economy 
stakes like that make penny arcades of the biggest casinos and 
they put pressures on the monetary players that are inconceivable 
in a gambling casino what this country needs is some flashing 
zeros

if the rise of the stock market to record highs 
this year has produced a new wave of optimism in the business 
world you cant tell it by the level of activity in stock splits 
and dividend increases 
in textbook bull markets corporate boards of directors act in 
large numbers to celebrate the upward course of prosperity by 
voting a split or a higher dividend payout or both at the same 
time 
right now figures compiled by standard amp poors corp attest 
they are doing neither at anything like the rate of boom years in 
the past 
through the first half of 1990 sampp tallied 48 splits of at least 
three shares for two among the 1600plus companies listed on the 
new york stock exchange 
at that rate the total for the year might fall short of 
matching the 105 splits recorded in 1989 mounting no threat at 
all to the record of 225 set in 1983 
the story on dividends from all the public companies reporting 
to sampp is even less impressive 
the firm counted 868 favorable dividend actions increases 
resumptions of suspended dividends and declarations of extra or 
special payouts in the first half of this year down from 1155 
in the comparable period of 1989 
on the other side of the coin the number of unfavorable 
changes including reductions and omissions swelled to 187 in this 
years first half from 109 over the like period last year 
these figures point up two of the most common complaints voiced 
by wall streeters and their customers about the bull market 
1990style 
the paucity of splits demonstrates the narrowness of the 
recent market rally in the words of sampp analysts with much of 
the gains concentrated in a few dozen bigname blue chips and 
growth stocks 
sluggish dividend activity meanwhile spotlights persistent 
weakness in corporate earnings which has led to much doubt and 
skepticism about the staying power of the advance in stock prices 
a stock split represents a gesture by a companys directors with 
more symbolic than tangible value 
in a 2for1 split for example the number of shares 
outstanding is doubled cutting earnings per share in half and 
producing no change in the total market value of an investors 
holdings its comparable to receiving two 10 bills for a 20 
sampp notes 
splits can however broaden enthusiasm for a stock in the 
marketplace by making 100share round lots easier for small 
investors to buy furthermore the stamp of optimism they register 
is quite often reinforced with an accompanying increase in the 
dividend 
when such dividend increases are scarce as they are right now 
the bottomline impact is felt directly in calculations of 
investors total return capital appreciation plus current income 
at midyear the dividend yield on the 30 stocks that make up the 
dow jones industrial average stood at 374 percent compared with 
919 percent for a sampling of topgrade corporate bonds tracked by 
barrons magazine 
analysts say that wide competitive disparity helps put stock 
prices largely at the mercy of changes in interestrate 
expectations 
one note of consolation both stock splits and dividends right 
now show very little sign of the kind of speculative enthusiasm 
that is often cited as a warning of an impending top in stock 
prices 
so if you buy the optimistic view the current dearth of splits 
and dividend increases holds out hope that the best is yet to come 
for stocks

convoy of disguised police trucks were involved in transporting the 
disassembled crated thrones under cover of darkness 
authorities say tight security is needed to guard against 
attacks from the radical leftists 
secrecy is not the wish of the government or the imperial 
family said nobuo ishihara deputy chief cabinet secretary we 
want to hold the ceremonies in the most open manner possible the 
reason is the attitude of the radicals 
a spokesman for the ultraleft chukakuha middle core faction 
said thats just an excuse for them to carry out their 
oppression to protect that antipeople institution 
he said in an interview on condition of anonymity that his 
oftenviolent group would continue the struggle to crush the 
coronation 
radical leftists number in the thousands but represent only a 
tiny minority of japanese who generally either support or accept 
the imperial household 
during the mystical rice ritual to be held after akihito is 
formally enthroned nov 12 the emperor is believed to commune with 
the sun goddess and other shinto deities 
the daijosai or great food offering ritual will take place in 
two specially built halls on the imperial palace grounds in tokyo 
beginning late at night and lasting several hours 
although it has been part of coronations for more than 1000 
years the daijosais religious nature has prompted intense debate 
of whether government plans to provide funds for it violate the 
postwar constitution the budget for the entire coronation is 811 
billion yen 556 million 
more than 30000 police are expected to protect the guests 
expected to attend the coronation who include prince charles and 
princess diana of britain and president fidel castro of cuba 
that number of police officers would be equal to about three of 
four in tokyo and one of every 10 nationwide 
about the same number helped guard hirohitos funeral in 
february president george bush and representatives of more than 
160 other nations attended the funeral 
once a precedent has been set for security arrangements it is 
very hard to propose a lower level a police source said 
speaking on condition of anonymity if something goes wrong you 
will always be remembered as the one who let it happen 
the visibility of police in the weeks before the funeral 
coupled with spot checks of cars and interviews of residents 
living in strategic areas led to many complaints that human rights 
were being violated 
police vigilance did not however stop leftist radicals from 
setting fire to a shrine near the funeral site and planting a bomb 
along the funeral procession route no one was injured by the bomb

the federal reserves reluctance to reinvigorate 
the flagging economy means consumers could soon feel the pinch that 
already has squeezed many manufacturers and builders a growing 
chorus of analysts say 
confidence among consumers in their financial wellbeing lags 
partly due to months of disappointing economic news reports of 
factory layoffs slumping house prices and business belttightening 
have shaken faith in continuing prosperity 
its time to get interest rates lower says robert a 
brusca chief economist at nikko securities co international inc 
i think the fed should ease but i think the fed looks at the 
word ease like a fourletter word 
the central bank has resisted altering policy despite ample 
evidence that a change is warranted brusca says the june 
unemployment data released friday furnished more proof that the 
economy is dangerously debilitated and in need of urgent attention 
as i read the numbers real problems have already started 
brusca says noting that recessionary conditions arent confined to 
factories and building sites anymore 
stores for instance particularly ones that supply expensive 
longlasting merchandise such as home appliances have had weak 
sales for months the contraction in total retail sales has 
produced the worst period for consumer spending in nine years 
economists say 
brian j fabbri chief economist at midland montagu securities 
inc says i think over the next couple of months well continue 
to see rather sluggish spending on the part of the consumer 
reflecting his waning confidence 
the labor departments monthly assessment showed private 
nonfarm businesses created 92000 new jobs in june a weaker 
number than the 125000 payroll additions private analysts had 
expected 
private industry has added only about 100000 new jobs a month 
so far in 1990 after subtracting the governments onceadecade 
hiring of census workers at midyear in 1989 private payrolls 
were growing about 200000 a month this years weak job growth has 
coincided with slumps in manufacturing and construction 
at the same time the civilian jobless rate has stayed stuck at 
about the same plateau it dipped to 52 percent in june from mays 
53 percent largely because fewer people were looking for work 
pushing down the labor force tally 
bond traders were frustrated by the widely awaited report 
because it lacked any compelling reason for the fed to do anything 
other than what it has been doing 
part of the feds stubborness in sticking to current policy 
stems from an unwillingness to jeopardize its credibility by 
appearing to bow to the bush administrations badgering 
administration officials have been pressuring the fed to pursue a 
more generous credit posture and nudge interest rates lower 
david h resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international inc says the latest unemployment news gave the fed 
support for its argument against easing 
he said the fed can point to the figures and ask if our 
policies are so bad how come unemployment is falling central 
bank policymakers also can claim some credit in the fight against 
inflation the feds chief mission 
resler says he believes a standoff situation has developed 
between the fed on the one side and the markets and the 
administration on the other 
the markets and the adminstration want the fed to enable 
interest rates to fall by making credit cheaper to come by in the 
banking system the fed would prefer to have its key lending rates 
it directly controls follow rather than precede market rates down 
the fed doesnt want to lead the charge the market though 
is looking for the fed to make the first step neither one is 
budging resler says 
agreement on a plan to cut the federal deficit at the budget 
summit in washington will probably be the catalyst that causes the 
fed finally to budge economists expect

the economy may be barely maintaining headway 
right now in the midst of recession fears but growth is a hot 
commodity on wall street anyway 
some analysts say its popularity may be reviving a set of 
financial principles that fell out of favor for much of the past 
decade 
in the stock markets rally to record highs over the past couple 
of months many of the standout performers have been shares of 
large companies with long records of consistent aboveaverage 
earnings growth 
when the typical money manager picks stocks these days the 
emphasis is on high quality and stability an international 
presence and an ability to ride out recessions as well as the 
shock of any debt crisis that might arise 
the growthstock theory of investing enjoyed a long vogue a 
generation or more ago it flourished in the strong expansion of 
the 1950s and 1960s exemplified by the successes of such hardy 
growth enterprises as international business machines corp 
the fashion reached the point of frenzy in the early 1970s when 
investors poured almost limitless amounts of money into the 
socalled favorite 50 growth companies which were billed as 
good buys at any price 
a severe bear market punctured that bubble however and even 
when stocks began a subsequent recovery investors looked elsewhere 
for inspiration 
when the boom of the 80s got rolling the watchword was 
value rather than growth investors sought companies with 
assets whose market values might blossom in a hothouse of 
takeovers buyouts and corporate restructurings 
now many analysts say as the cleanup continues from that binge 
of borrowing and speculation growth stocks may be getting another 
chance to shine 
the stock market is nowhere near as outrageously overpriced as 
a lot of other things says barton biggs investment strategist 
at morgan stanley amp co 
as money flees the carnage why wont it run to high quality 
bonds and equities it has to go somewhere and if money begins to 
worry seriously about the safety of banks and money market funds 
the shares of real growth companies with global franchises may look 
as good as anything 
the growthstock theme manifested itself clearly in the second 
quarter when prominent companies in industries like 
pharmaceuticals and food posted some of the best gains 
it remained in evidence this past week as the market got off to 
a quiet start on the third quarter the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed friday at 290495 up 2426 from the week 
before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 030 to 
19578 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 175 to 46054 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 244 at 35887 
volume on the big board averaged 12507 million shares a day 
against 14055 million the week before 
investment themes have come and gone with stunning speed on wall 
street in the past few years so few analysts are ready to declare 
with any certainty that the growth stocks comeback is booked for a 
long run 
when and if interest rates fall further and the economy shows 
signs of picking up momentum the search for bargains in the market 
could well shift to industrial and other cyclical companies with 
close ties to the business cycle 
in any event nobody claims its easy to pick winning growth 
stocks that can sustain their performance over periods of years 
rather than weeks 
a single quarterly earnings disappointment has been enough to 
knock many a glamour stock off its perch of late 
but for the moment at least the trend seems indisputable we 
are in a growth stock market said john connolly at dean witter 
reynolds inc our strategy continues to have consumer growth 
issues at the core of our portfolio

a slow economy pressing debts and fewer readers 
have combined to demonstrate vividly the growing vulnerability 
among american newspaper publishers 
two of the most prominent names in newspapering ralph m 
ingersoll ii and the gannett co emerged this past week as the 
latest sufferers from a slowdown in what historically has been a 
highly profitable industry 
ingersoll the ambitious publishing executive who financed a 
us expansion partly through highinterest junk bond credit and 
unsuccessfully launched a new st louis paper earlier this year 
relinquished control of his american newspaper interests to an 
investment partner em warburg pincus amp co 
in the same transaction ingersoll acquired warburgs 
halfinterest in a european newspaper publisher he thereby 
extricated himself from the debt burden of his three us 
publishing companies which owe about 700 million 
ingersoll said his primary motive was to exploit what he 
believed to be a vibrant market for newspapers in europe which has 
become the most economically dynamic part of the world 
but industry analysts said the high debt load ingersoll amassed 
in this country clearly was a key reason for the move which seemed 
to shatter his desire to become one of the biggest newspaper owners 
in the united states he had controlled 10 dailies and more than 
120 weeklies 
sheer size however does not necessarily make a newspaper 
empire invulnerable gannett the current no 1 newspaper company 
in the country disclosed its own form of financial distress this 
past week 
the 82daily newspaper giant which also publishes usa today 
nationally said it expected secondquarter earnings to fall that 
would mark the first time since gannett went public 22 years ago 
that quarterly earnings have declined from a year earlier the 
company is due to issue secondquarter earnings later this month 
as one of the most financially stable newspaper companies 
gannett does not have the debt problem ingersoll faced but both 
have been affected by what industry strategists have called some 
common underlying trends 
the newspaper industry has been suffering a slowdown for the 
last three years as advertising revenues have slowed said susan 
putnam who follows the newspaper business for moran amp associates 
inc an investment firm in greenwich conn theyve cut costs 
and got operations down to a lean level but revenue growth hasnt 
picked up so theyre suffering earnings declines 
the sluggishness rippling through the economy has complicated 
the outlook for newspapers which generally derive most of their 
revenue from retail automobile and classified advertising 
many retailers hurt by high debt levels of their own have cut 
back drastically on ads although publicizing sales in newspapers 
historically has been considered the cheapest and most effective 
way to attract customers 
automakers which also are slumping havent been aggressively 
offering rebates this year which in turn tends to reduce the 
amount of newspaper advertising by dealers 
within the classified ad category the most prevalent ads real 
estate and employment also have fallen analysts say 
in some economically depressed parts of the country where many 
properties are for sale for example owners and brokers simply 
have given up advertising in newspapers because of poor response 
this past week the conference board a new yorkbased business 
research group that tracks the volume of employment advertising 
said its helpwanted index dropped in may to the lowest level in 
four years in recessionbattered new england the level was off by 
nearly a third from a year earlier 
many newspapers have responded to their slump partly by 
aggressive drives to increase circulation this gives newspapers 
the justification to charge more for ads because presumably they 
are seen by more readers 
but this strategy has been been undermined by another problem 
that the newspaper industry increasingly is confronting many 
people particularly the young arent reading the papers 
some studies show for example that only 30 percent of 
americans under age 35 read a paper regularly about half the 
percentage of two decades ago 
perhaps the most troubling study was released recently by the 
times mirror center for the people amp the press which shows the 
younger generation knows less cares less and reads newspapers 
less than any generation in the past 50 years 
in other business and economic news this past week 
more evidence emerged of softness in the economy the 
unemployment rate fell slightly to 52 percent but that was due to 
fewer people looking for work new job growth remained weak 
boeing co received a jumbojet order potentially worth 69 
billion from british airways plc but will have to wait for word on 
whether it receives an order from ual corp that could be worth 20 
billion unions trying to buy ual delayed negotiations on their 
potentially record jetliner order until they secure financing for 
their acquisition of the airline company 
brokers who belly up to the bar could be in for a doubly 
unpleasant tax surprise the federal government seeking ways to 
raise tax revenues to close the federal budget deficit is 
considering a 05 percent levy on securities sales and may seek to 
sharply raise the excise tax on alcohol
