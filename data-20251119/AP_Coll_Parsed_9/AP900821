the shortage of donor organs is so acute 
that hospitals must begin approaching the families of dead patients 
to save other lives a transplant specialist said tuesday 
hospital officials rarely ask grieving families to consider 
donating their loved ones organs said dr calvin stiller head of 
transplant surgery at the university of western ontario 
when they do the question is often so awkwardly worded the 
families immediately reject the idea he said 
sometimes it can be you dont want to donate the organs do 
you said stiller who estimated that at least 80 percent of 
possible donor organs go unused 
a panel of medical experts discussed the problem here tuesday 
during the international congress of transplantation society 
dr oscar salvatierra chief of university of californiasan 
franciscos transplant service said media attention helped find 
donors in some cases 
however publicity doesnt always work considering the 
limited donor pool he told the gathering of about 2700 people 
representing 47 countries 
last year 3993 people in the united states were registered as 
organ donors 
by contrast 13290 transplants were performed according to the 
united network for organ sharing which contracts with the federal 
government to run a national organ distribution network and 
registry 
there are about 20460 patients waiting for organs the unos 
said 
the public should be educated encouraged and cajoled to 
donate for love said dr anthony monaco professor of surgery at 
harvard university 
the government could pay the donor he said 
say everyone could get a government insurance policy if 
they will agree to donate he said 
but stiller said many in the medical and scientific communities 
opposed paying donors 
donating is no longer a charitable event its an 
obligation he

polands noble families dispersed around 
the world or reduced to cramped walkups in their native land have 
little but memories of their once elegant estates 
most of the landed gentrys homes have been destroyed since the 
communists nationalized their property in the late 1940s 
now with the communist regime gone a lastchance effort is 
afoot to preserve the remaining historic manors either by 
returning them to their former owners or finding new ones 
ludwika sobanskatyszkiewiczowa born to one of polands noblest 
families and married to another remembers the vast estate of her 
birth in the ukraine at age 2 she played with nuts on the floor 
as the bolshevik revolution of 1917 raged outside the sandbagged 
windows 
as a newlywed on the eve of world war ii she moved to her 
husbands manor in eastern poland within a year she was swimming 
the river outside with her baby strapped to her back and the red 
army in pursuit 
equally vivid are recollections of the carefree opulence of 
those years between the wars when the lawns and ballroom of the 
family palace at guzow outside warsaw was filled with polands 
dignitaries 
with a wistfulness echoed even by poles of common birth mrs 
sobanska lingers on the memory of her familys dwory manor 
houses of the selfsufficient estates on which rural polands 
social and economic system was based for four centuries 
dwory were administrative centers for the surrounding farmland 
warehouses and mills some were palaces others large farmhouses 
they were built in tune with the vacillating fortunes of polands 
passionately nationalist clannish and independent nobility which 
was 10 percent of the population in the 16th century and among 
europes largest through the 18th century 
of mrs sobanskas properties in poland guzow and a warsaw 
mansion still stand but they no longer belong to her what did not 
succumb to war or shifting borders was taken by the new communist 
state 
stately homes of polands muchromanticized gentry became the 
orphanages and factory headquarters of peoples poland farmland 
was divided among the peasants 
without money for proper upkeep dwory fell to ruin and were 
abandoned with tragic consequences to the nations cultural 
heritage 
fortyfive years later little remains of the estimated 20000 
historic homes that survived world war ii only about 2000 are 
salvageable 
nostalgia the desire to right wrongs and capitalist zeal for a 
good bargain propel the preservation effort 
former owners may apply to reclaim their properties the culture 
ministry and the postcommunist eras first private real estate 
companies also are hunting new buyers 
what is happening in poland now offers great hope for 
monuments said tadeusz zielinewicz the ministrys chief 
building conservator we conservators have always been saying the 
best way of protecting a monument is a good use a good owner the 
state was not such a good owner 
in many ways it is painful work 
it has all turned into ruin mrs sobanska said after a 
recent tour of the palace at guzow 25 miles east of warsaw now 
headquarters for an adjacent sugar beet factory it will be too 
late for me but maybe someone from my family can invest 
pravin shah a jeans merchant from wales stood somberly before 
the decaying facade and boardedup windows of a manor in zdunowo 
it makes me sad to see something so beautiful standing there 
waiting said shah who is looking over polish manors in search 
of an investment 
grass covered the sweeping drive and sewage choked the 
ornamental ponds sunlight filtering through a hole in the roof 
touched the few bits of ornamental plaster still in place 
the manor was used as an agricultural school then abandoned for 
a decade and a young polish architect bought it for a song two 
years ago 
he wants to make it into a 55room hotel and restaurant just 45 
minutes north of the capital but needs 25 million janusz 
lipinski cofounder of polands first real estate agency korona 
is looking for a western investor who sees the potential in a 
country so short of tourist accommodations 
lipinski has 100 or more applications from families seeking to 
buy back homes that were nationalized after the war parliament is 
working out favorable terms but most families dont have enough 
money 
this reprivatization of homes as opposed to farmland is 
encouraged by many people who harbor a deep respect for the 
stratified society of polands past glory despite four decades of 
communism the names of aristocratic polish families are easily 
recalled 
in july when princess klaudia sanguszko visited the family 
estate near tarnow in southeastern poland former servants lined up 
to meet her and the town council made her son called the young 
prince by newspapers an honorary citizen 
purchases by foreigners are more controversial and few have come 
to fruition members of parliament nervous about polands being 
bought out especially by a united germany next door voted 
last month to prohibit sales of stateowned property to foreigners 
longterm leases are allowed and privately owned tracts of land 
can be sold with interior ministry permission jointventure 
companies also can buy 
joanna onyskiewicz lipinskis partner in the korona agency is 
adamant about bringing commercial viability to polands historic 
properties 
we have no other chance in a country where the kitty is 
empty to save our heritage ourselves she said 
low prices are a large part of the lure a manor in rundown 
condition can sell for as little as 1000 
korona offers a 10room country house with surrounding gardens 
that could be remodeled as a small hotel for a modest total 
investment of 250000 
there is the stuff of dreams a gutted 36bedroom palace from 
the early 18th century on 30 acres of parks that once were 
landscaped the rubber industry institute will sell it for 200000 
falling in love with a polish dwor is just the beginning 
buyers face a fantastic amount of red tape lipinski said 
you have to be patient in poland 
both initial questions who is the owner and how much does it 
cost require detective work in the infamous bureaucratic maze 
some properties are governmentowned with a state industry as a 
longterm tenant 
buyers also face the daunting task of a complete renovation 
from water pipes to roof in a nation short of building materials 
strict rules for historical restoration must be followed 
an ugly polluting industry may have been built nearby lupinski 
said sighing over a paint factory beside a moated 15th century 
castle 
it is a pleasure to work with these buildings but so 
depressing to see their situation he said then pointed at the 
crumbling lifeless zdunowo mansion and added that from 45 years 
of communism

distraught people telephone the gulf support group 
for news of relatives stranded in kuwait and iraq but they often 
end up talking about themselves 
when people call looking for information we ask them are you 
all right and other questions which will elicit how they are 
coping joanna copley one of the hotline organizers said monday 
ms copleys 27yearold sister katharine was on board a 
british airways flight that stopped for fuel in kuwait on aug 2 
the day iraq invaded the emirate as of friday she was still in 
that occupied country 
many of the callers like the widow whose only child is in 
kuwait do not want advice theyre just looking for a soothing 
voice and a friendly ear to hear them work through their grief 
anger frustration and guilt 
they feel guilty first because they are safe in england and 
secondly because if theyve had a family quarrel they may wish 
that theyd left on better terms and that there may never be a 
chance to make things right ms copley said in an interview at 
the hotline offices 
the hotline was set up aug 7 as an information clearing house 
for relatives of britons stranded in kuwait and iraq it receives 
up to 200 calls each day said ms copley 29 a computer 
consultant 
her pearls and countrystyle dress with a large white ribbon 
belie a steely determination i dont know why i decided to act 
maybe i react faster or get angry quicker she said 
the foreign office estimates there are 4000 british citizens in 
kuwait and 500 in iraq the largest number of westerners in the 
crisis area 
ms copley said relatives grow more anxious each day their 
fears fueled by reports and rumors swirling around the persian gulf 
the only westerner to have been killed in kuwait since the aug 
2 invasion is douglas croskery a 45yearold british businessman 
shot near the saudi arabian border as he tried to leave kuwait 
on monday foreign secretary douglas hurd said diplomats were 
trying to verify the whereabouts of 123 britons rounded up in 
kuwait 
and he said the foreign office was working closely with the gulf 
support group which includes a member of parliament robert 
hayward among its founders 
our officials in kuwait and baghdad are doing their utmost 
they are doing a formidable job they are doing their utmost to 
keep in touch with people in difficulty to find out what is 
happening hurd said its extremely difficult to do so i pay 
tribute to rob hayward i pay tribute to people in the same 
business 
calls have come from all over ms copley said 
britons escaping kuwait have added to the information from 
diplomatic sources but many of the escapees require counseling 
themselves ms copley said 
a guy i just got off the phone with admitted that he only had 
10 pounds 19 he worked in kuwait his house is in kuwait and 
his bank account is there he has no way of getting money she 
said 
these people arent professionals they are not wealthy 
expats expatriots many are oil and gas workers with only the 
clothes they stand up in 
trained volunteers have said relatives and escapees are calling 
in a serious state of desperation 
many cant talk about it without crying both women and men i 
get emotional ms copley said her voice faltering 
the foreign office also set up a telephone line for relatives 
but it was heavily criticized for making it a paypercall number 
the foreign office subsequently announced that the proceeds would 
go to charity 
ms copley said she would not criticize the foreign office but 
she added families are not interested in future charities they 
have immediate problems

scientists are turning an isolated 
island into a laboratory to test a genetically engineered rabies 
vaccine on raccoons 
in the first field test of the vaccine in the united states 26 
scientists monday took boats to parramore island and put out 4000 
doses of the vaccine inside baited tubes to attract the 400 
raccoons on the strip of land 
over the next year some of the animals will be caught alive and 
tested to see if the vaccine produced antibodies to fight rabies 
raccoons are the biggest source of rabies in the united states 
often transmitting the virus to dogs and cats that tangle with them 
if we can control rabies in the raccoon population we will 
have come a long way in handling rabies in pets said dr suzanne 
jenkins assistant epidemiologist with the state health department 
the only sign of man on the 10milelong barrier island is a 
coast guard station at one end 
we knew we needed an island for this test because we wanted 
limited access and a population of raccoons that would not be 
wandering off somewhere ms jenkins said since this is a 
test it was felt it would be better if there was not public 
access you dont let people into your laboratory what weve done 
is create an outdoor laboratory 
the vaccine developed by philadelphias wistar institute is 
inserted into small tubes of soft plastic treated with fish oil 
then the bait is covered with a crab slurry crab parts that 
have been left out for awhile to attract the raccoons said 
warren b cheston wistar associate director as a raccoon chews on 
the bait the liquid vaccine is released in its mouth 
the wistar is the nations oldest nonprofit biomedical research 
institute 
using genetic engineering wistar took from the rabies virus a 
minute piece of genetic material that induces formation of 
antibodies and grafted that fragment onto the harmless vaccinia 
virus used in smallpox vaccine 
a similar vaccine is being used in europe and canada to control 
rabies in foxes scientists believe the wistar vaccine could have 
broader application 
robert miller of the us department of agriculture said if the 
test on parramore island works the department will approve a 
mainland test of the vaccine cheston said wistar has been working 
with pennsylvania to find a test site 
the vaccine engineered in 1982 may be available within five 
years 
ms jenkins said the bait could be spread from airplanes as is 
being done in canada 
i could see using it to produce corridors of vaccinated 
animals around population centers to keep rabies out she said 
you could encircle isolated cases of rabies in the same manner 
and keep it from spreading

an experimental drug made from a japanese 
fungus improves liver transplant patients chances of survival by 
up to 20 percent over those taking the standard antirejection 
medication scientists say 
transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl said monday that 23 
university of pittsburgh studies of fk506 confirm earlier findings 
of its superiority over cyclosporine 
starzl head of the universitys transplant program told 
colleagues at a meeting of the international congress of the 
transplantation society this week in san francisco that fk506 
poses a lower risk of kidney failure and high blood pressure side 
effects of cyclosporine 
both drugs prevent rejection of the transplanted organ 
immediately after the operation but fk506 also prevents delayed 
rejection researchers said 
the initial results are very encouraging said dr john 
armitage an assistant professor of surgery at the university who 
conducted one of the studies theres no question that fk506 is 
going to find its place in future treatment 
the university has given the drug to about 800 patients 
the studies conducted from february 1989 to june of this year 
included the first look at how the drug worked on children 
doctors said high doses of steroids were unnecessary for 42 
young patients who used fk506 some patients need steroids to 
reduce the toxicity of cyclosporine but high doses can cause 
stunted growth facial puffiness and other problems 
with fk506 were hoping that these children will not require 
a second or third transplant said dr andreas tzakis an 
associate professor of surgery who conducted the study with the 
scarcity of organs available for children this drug may result in 
organs available for a larger number of children 
but dr james wolf president of the united network for organ 
sharing said fk506 could make more people eligible for 
transplants creating pressure to find more donors about 20000 
people are waiting for organ transplants in the united states 
the drug made by fujisawa pharmaceutical co ltd of osaka 
japan has been approved for testing exclusively at the university 
of pittsburgh although in a few cases it was given to patients at 
other hospitals 
the drug must undergo further studies before the food and drug 
administration approves its general use for liver transplant 
patients further tests will be required before it can go on the 
market for other transplant patients 
theres no question its a very effective drug for liver 
transplants said dr robert corry board member of the united 
network for organ sharing we still dont know enough about it 
with other organs 
dr ronald lieberman who directs an fda team studying the drug 
said approval will probably take at least two years 
in studies on liver transplant patients the university reported 
eighteen percent of those taking fk506 developed high blood 
pressure compared with 60 percent of patients on cyclosporine 
thirteen percent suffered kidney failure compared with 26 
percent for those on cyclosporine 
potentially fatal infections occurred less frequently and were 
less severe in patients taking fk506

sometimes baggage would be purposely broken apart dropped 
etc so that the contents would be revealed and they could 
identify that it was something worth stealing said jim r

saddam hussein appears to be keeping a 
low public profile as iraqs confrontation with the united states 
intensifies but arab diplomats and other knowledgeable sources 
agree that hes firmly in control in baghdad 
the last time he was seen by the outside world was aug 14 when 
iraqis staterun television showed him greeting king hussein of 
jordan one of his closest allies at baghdad airport 
the jordanian monarch was in iraq for talks on the crisis 
following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
saddam 54 has made several important statements over the last 
few days but these have been read on iraqi television and radio by 
an announcer 
the sources who all spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed 
reports in the arab media that there have been attempts to 
assassinate saddam and his senior aides in recent days 
one wellinformed source declared hes very much alive these 
reports are groundless the source said the iraqi capital was 
calm but naturally a little tense as iraq builds up its forces 
in kuwait and the united states strengthens its military contingent 
in saudi arabia 
official sources in cairo reported monday that the foreign 
ministry received a report from sayed abuzaid the egyptian 
ambassador in baghdad that made no mention of any attempts on 
saddams life 
there have been several reported assassination attempts against 
saddam since he took power in 1979 
baghdad radio reported that saddam met monday with indian 
external affairs minister indir kumar to discuss bilateral 
relations the meeting was attended by iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz it said 
it also reported that the president sent a close confidant 
saadoun hammadi to moscow on monday hammadi is a member of the 
ruling 11man revolutionary command council headed by saddam 
a senior military source in an arab capital said monday that he 
was in daily telephone contact with saddam and that the iraqi 
leader was clearly in control in baghdad 
we know how president saddam is doing because were in touch 
with him constantly by telephone said the source who spoke on 
condition that his name and nationality were not disclosed he told 
the associated press we talk to him all the time 
this source said saddam is living with his inlaws in baghdad 
hes not hiding out in a military base as everyone thinks 
he gave no other details nor did he explain why the president 
should be living with his wifes family and not in his heavily 
guarded palace on the banks of the tigris river or in his command 
bunker 
but if the report is correct it could be that saddam is 
concerned about the possibility of a us air or missile strike 
against the palace or other buildings he is known to frequent 
egypts middle east news agency last week quoted a palestinian 
official as saying he met saddam at a military complex outside 
baghdad where the iraqi leader haggard and pale was 
protected by heavy security following a reported assassination 
attempt 
during the 198088 war with iran saddam was often not seen in 
public for periods of up to two weeks but the statecontrolled 
media bombarded iraqs 16 million people with photographs and 
television footage of their leader in uniform with his troops or 
meeting commanders

by midday monday the temperature in the 
saudi desert was probably 130 degrees but lt col jim mattis 
wouldnt know his thermometer only reaches 120 
the desert is a cruel place as the marine platoon in the hills 
several miles from the nearest road is finding out by 830 am 
monday the sun was so hot a group of marines in a mortar unit 
gladly remained hidden under their camouflaged tents 
we just try to rest when we can and stay cool when we can 
said one in line with defense department rules neither he nor any 
of the enlisted men could give their names and the location of 
their unit could not be disclosed 
the marines tents covered with camouflaged netting were so 
well concealed that only their vague outline could be distinguished 
in the brown sand 
a group of marines relaxed on tarps under one big tent while 
smaller numbers manned the mortars and served as lookouts 
the marines have trained in the mojave desert but the united 
states has not been involved in a desert campaign since the united 
states and great britain joined together to defeat the germans in 
north africa in 1943 
because of the heat the men usually keep watch just two hours 
at a time in their off hours they sleep eat bone up on desert 
warfare tactics and perform chores such as cleaning their guns 
all marines are issued three packages of food mres for meal 
ready to eat daily each package contains about 3000 calories in 
the form of crackers a beef or chicken meal cheese cookies and 
dehydrated fruit 
water is one of the biggest challenges in the desert marines 
are told to drink five gallons a day which is brought in by 
water buffalo or military trailers used to haul water 
to ward off the sun they cover their skin use sunscreen and 
wear hats and sunglasses 
even so they are only kept out in the desert for three days 
before rotating back to the makeshift barracks usually big 
airconditioned rooms 
while the heat is overpowering several marines said their 
biggest fear is the threat of chemical weapons 
each marine has a gas mask plus three vials of atropen an 
antidote to nerve gas should a marine be exposed to the gas he 
must inject himself with the agent 
for the marines one of the biggest frustrations is being out of 
touch with world events 
even maj gen john hopkins head of the 7th marine 
expeditionary brigade said he had no time to listen to the radio 
to find out what the reaction in the united states was to the 
deployment

scores of arabs have fled kuwait into 
saudi arabia by walking across the desert or slipping past iraqi 
soldiers by car but now only a few western refugees are making the 
run 
three britons who made it across the border on sunday were the 
last reported western escapees along that route border area 
residents said monday 
one saudi resident speaking in a telephone interview said 
fewer kuwaiti families were arriving but that dozens of egyptians 
pakistanis and indian workers were walking part of an 80mile 
stretch to reach saudi arabia 
the ones coming in just look very confused said the 
resident who could see the refugees at the saudi arabian border 
checkpoint at khafji 
the ones who go on foot seem to just move through the dense 
iraqi troop movements on the other side he said speaking on 
condition of anonymity but the cars do not seem to be coming 
across now as they used to do in earlier days 
some travelers said iraqi troops and tanks were apparently 
cutting off open border areas which hundreds of westerners and 
kuwaitis have fled across since iraqi president saddam hussein 
ordered his troops into kuwait on aug 2 
attempting a border crossing can be a deadly maneuver refugees 
said 
they shoot at any approaching car said a traveler who 
arrived in khafji late last week the soldiers fired at a car 
behind me and injured a 37yearold woman in her right thigh 
life inside iraqioccupied kuwait is also growing more dangerous 
iraqi television which is now broadcast in kuwait announced 
last week that anyone hoarding food would be executed 
one traveler told the khafji residents that the sultan center a 
large grocery store in the kuwait city suburb of salmiya was 
completely out of provisions 
but kuwaitis say their families usually have large quantities of 
food stored usually sufficient for a month 
some kuwaitis in saudi arabia said they contact relatives and 
friends still in kuwait by car telephones that work on the other 
side of the border those inside kuwait say they are not permitted 
to buy anything in large quantities 
irans islamic republic news agency quoted iranians returning 
from kuwait as saying foodstuffs were scarce the city bazaar was 
closed and the general situation in kuwait was tense 
they say iraqi soldiers are taking position here and there 
throughout kuwait and especially in alahmadi port with tanks and 
armored vehicles roaming in the city streets amid sporadic 
overnight shooting the agency reported 
the agency estimated that 10000 iranians of the 100000strong 
iranian community in kuwait have returned to iran 
kuwaitis fleeing their country into saudi arabia often arrive 
disheveled and dejected their eyes bloodshot 
they huddle around transistor radio listening to reports from 
free kuwait radio that are broadcast clandestinely somewhere in the 
persian gulf 
their newspapers among the liveliest in the arab world despite 
a censorship clamped since 1986 are beginning to emerge in other 
capitals alqabas in london alanbaa in cairo and shortly 
alseyassah in saudi arabia the others have yet to make a comeback 
kuwaiti embassies in gulf countries have been looking after the 
refugees arranging accommodations financial assistance and 
medical care 
the younger men invariably say they have decided on one thing 
to see that their families are settled in safer countries and then 
they will join the resistance at home 
we will fight win or die said bandar alshallahi a 
journalist with the kuwait news agency its pointless to live 
without a country and we will reinstate our emir sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah whether saddam likes it or not

at a long table in a windowless room in the 
state department us consular officers answer about 4000 
telephone calls a day from worried relatives of the americans whom 
president bush described monday as hostages in iraq and kuwait 
it was heavier in the beginning and it seems to kind of go in 
cycles depending on events said judy baroody press officer for 
the special task force set up by the department to deal with the 
crisis in the persian gulf 
ms baroody said from 60 to 80 officers staff the telephone bank 
24 hours a day in shifts of 15 at one time 
they have a system of data banks in which they keep names and 
information about american citizens to provide to relatives ms 
baroody said 
at all times one officer is detailed to handle special cases 
such as those with particular medical needs or small children 
she said this officer also deals with the families of those in 
iraqi custody such as the 12 the department said were taken from 
hotels in kuwaits capital and moved to undisclosed locations 
information that might be given out would be what kind of 
advice is being provided to americans in kuwait and iraq whether 
the borders are closed and whether it is safe to cross by a land 
route the press officer said 
she said they also provide information on food supplies 
available curfews and problems involving exit permits 
ms baroody described the room as a typical office with 
fluorescent lighting in the ceiling like others in the state 
department it is an interior room with no windows 
there are more than 3000 americans and thousands of other 
foreign citizens now under iraqi control 
the administration had been reluctant to call them hostages 
saying no demands had been made as conditions for their release 
bush addressing the national convention of the veterans of 
foreign wars in baltimore demanded the release of the foreigners 
and said that whatever these innocent citizens are called they 
are in fact hostages 
iraqi leader saddam hussein said in baghdad sunday that he would 
free the foreign nationals if bush withdrew us forces from saudi 
arabia and if a worldwide trade embargo against baghdad were lifted

residents of the florida keys are fed up 
with bausch and lombs monkey business 
the visioncare giant put thousands of monkeys on two small 
deserted islands more than a decade ago to breed offering a steady 
supply of laboratory animals to biomedical researchers 
but people who live near the islands where the rhesus monkeys 
have been allowed to run free fouling the water and turning lush 
mangrove trees into useless skeletons object to what they deem 
needless environmental destruction 
it looks like a war zone right now just like vietnam said 
james mcelroy whos part of a grassroots antimonkey campaign 
the rhesus monkeys have been good business since they were first 
brought over from india 18 years ago handlers regularly dispense 
monkey chow and capture more than a thousand each year generating 
more than 15 million in annual sales 
the breeding colonies became more important to us researchers 
after india pakistan and bangladesh banned monkey exports in the 
late 1970s said dr joseph held vice president for primate 
research at charles river laboratories the division of bausch and 
lomb that runs the islands 
and because they are untainted by herpes b virus and other 
infections from the outside world they are much more valuable than 
other primates destined for the nations laboratories held said 
its the cleanest healthiest commercial production colony in 
the world held said 
most of the animals are sold to labs doing advanced neurological 
research none are used for eyecare tests the company says 
more than 1900 breeding animals and several thousand of their 
offspring roam on 300 acres of partially submerged wetlands on key 
lois and raccoon key another companyowned island several miles 
away 
even charles river laboratories which is under a consent 
agreement to replace damaged trees and reduce the population 
agrees that the monkeys have made a mess of things 
the rhesus stripped the leaves from thousands of red mangroves 
a protected species and now struggle to find shade in the florida 
sun their waste has fouled the waters leaving a band of 
yellowishbrown algae that chokes out marine life 
they werent too noticeable until the vegetation began 
disappearing thats when people became alarmed mcelroy said 
even armed with the necessary permits from progrowth keys 
officials humans could never get away with such destruction said 
curt kruer a biologist and audobon society leader who has studied 
keys wetlands for 13 years and can see key lois from his backyard 
you could take all the mangroves destroyed for condo projects 
in the keys in the past 10 years and it wouldnt come close to 
this kruer said as he poled his boat in for a close look at key 
lois last week wheres it all going to end 
the state owns everything below the highwater line including 
the area where most of the mangroves have been destroyed and 
environmental officials ordered the company to clean up those 
grounds years ago 
charles river laboratories fenced in and replanted some trees 
but disputed the boundary and sued the state in 1986 nothing much 
changed until the two sides quietly agreed to a settlement in may 
that would allow the company to phase out the monkeys over 2030 
years 
mcelroy kruer and other keys activists raised a ruckus gov 
bob martinez and the florida cabinet eager to improve their 
environmental image in this election year responded by scuttling 
the agreement and deciding to go after charles river for destroying 
state property instead 
they just stripped all the state land and left it bare 
martinez said at the june 26 cabinet meeting id like to see if 
we can prosecute 
ken plante general counsel for the florida department of 
environmental resources says the title dispute must be resolved 
first a status hearing has been scheduled for aug 30 
the department is still trying to find surveyors willing to 
brave the monkeys and measure the property plante said 
meanwhile the company is quietly scouting out alternative sites 
where the breeding operation can be moved said barbara kelley a 
spokeswoman at bausch and lombs rochester ny headquarters

texans soon will be able to see previously secret 
documents stemming from legal battles including those fought over 
sensitive environmental and productliability cases 
civil liberties advocates goodgovernment groups and media 
organizations are hailing the state supreme courts 
firstinthenation procedural change which takes effect sept 1 
its not that we expect on the first day a line of people 
walking into the courthouse said jim harrington texas civil 
liberties union legal director but the rules will turn the files 
there into a public library for our watchdogs 
environmentalists and consumer organizations were particularly 
thrilled by the change adopted in april at the request of the 
legislature they frequently have won settlements only to have 
sealed court records keep information on toxic substances and other 
hazards unavailable 
if a manufacturer loses a lawsuit such as exploding gas tanks 
on an automobile that information cant be sealed up and filed 
away in a file drawer someplace said tom smith director of 
public citizen a consumer rights group in austin 
maintaining open records can do nothing but help protect the 
public said mary kelly an austin lawyer and legal coordinator 
for the sierra club in texas 
but dane harris president of the texas association of business 
said the rule could hurt businesses that may become targets of 
lawsuitminded attorneys on fishing expeditions 
we feel like it opens up the opportunity for people to become 
aware of sometimes competitive tradesensitive information we 
think it invites needless litigation said harris whose 
organization urged the justices not to adopt the rule 
we feel like just having these records available for whoever 
wants to go on a fishing expedition is not conducive to a 
probusiness climate that will maintain and create jobs 
some defense lawyers also have claimed the threat of publicizing 
court documents would hurt their chances of obtaining settlements 
the rules adopted by a 54 vote say no court order or opinion 
may be sealed other records are presumed open and can be sealed 
only by showing a serious or substantial interest 
the new rules open discovery documents those exchanged by 
opposing lawyers before trial if they contain information that 
could affect public safety or governmental operations 
it is extremely important in that some of the best information 
on hazardous chemicals has been developed through litigation 
said ms kelly in litigation everyone is motivated to find out 
as much as they can through discovery a lot of information on the 
hazards of asbestos was blown open through litigation 
the rules do not cover divorce records and other family matters 
some monetary amounts in settlements and pretrial matters involving 
trade secrets 
madelyn applebaum spokeswoman for the association of trial 
lawyers of america said texas was the first to adopt the rules 
although florida has since adopted such a policy and efforts are 
under way in new york to release records 
she said two weeks ago the rhode island governor vetoed a bill 
that would have adopted similar rules

a old safe found in a creek was cracked open 
before a crowd of onlookers revealing no gold jewels or cash 
just mud and rust 
a locksmith and his son pried open the door of the twoton 
6foot safe monday prompting a cheer from the crowd 
inside the rusty iron box were empty shelves coated with silt 
and mud from mill creek where it was thought to have been dumped 
after the old state capitol burned in 1935 
have you seen geraldo state treasurer tony meeker joked 
referring to geraldo riveras muchballyhooed tv program on the 
opening of al capones vault in chicago like salems safe 
capones vault was virtually empty 
since no one knew for sure that salems safe was only 
heavyweight litter the opening was awaited with hope of finding 
valuables or historical artifacts 
james jones coordinator of the state historical properties 
commission said it wasnt a total loss the safe has historical 
value and could become a museum pieceim just glad its in such 
good shape inside he said 
jones and about 100 volunteers had removed the safe from the 
creek last week and set it up on the sidewalk in front of his 
office

one man who acts as 
americas electronic eyes and ears over a good part of saudi arabia 
says the skies are filled with a constant stream of us aircraft 
from operation desert shield 
theres just a whole ton of people up there said lt mark 
smith a navy radar officer aboard the surveillance aircraft e2c 
hawkeye 
a bit clumsy in appearance but more hightech in performance 
smiths twinengine turboprop is adorned with a flat radar disk 
similar to the much larger awacs airborne warning and control 
system planes that also have been deployed to saudi arabias 
defense against a possible iraqi invasion 
smith and his colleagues fly high above northwestern saudi 
arabia to search out any possible threat from the air or the ground 
to the battle group of the carrier uss eisenhower sailing far 
below in the red sea 
because the crew with what its men call their electronic 
goodies can peer far into the skies they provide the battle 
group with a large envelope of security they can warn the ships of 
any missiles aircraft or vessels that might appear beyond the 
horizon undetected by the ships own radar systems 
and today in the skies above saudi arabia tension and activity 
are high us aircraft are appearing about every 30 miles or so 
in a constant stream either inbound or outbound smith said 
the crew might have 30 to 40 such friendly targets to follow at 
a time 
some of them most probably are the c130 transport aircraft 
recently allowed to operate out of the united arab emirates the 
federation of sheikdoms on the southern edge of the persian gulf 
has now joined saudi arabia in openly granting access to us 
forces to its strategic territory 
squadrons of f16s f4s and f15e jet fighters a10 bombers 
and the f117a stealth fighterbombers are packing the skies 
the pentagon has pressed so many transport aircraft into service 
for the saudi operation that theyve even turned to the civilian 
reserve air fleet for the use of some us commercial aircraft 
as far as i can tell the iraqis are staying on their side 
and were a long way away from them that suits me just fine 
smith said because of the heightened state of activity smith said 
the carriers two hawkeyes must be in the skies 24 hours a day 
were flying around the clock and we dont stop any more 
said smith during a 530 am breakfast break on the carrier 
the eisenhower and its air wing had been scheduled to return 
stateside next month until the persian gulf crisis diverted them to 
the red sea 
were racking up a lot of flight hours now that we normally 
wouldnt at the end of a deployment smith said adding that each 
crew takes to the skies twice a day sometimes six to eight hours 
at a time 
the flying isnt the high profile flyboy job held by the 
carriers jet fighter and bomber pilots but the role is just as 
vital 
and despite their grueling schedule the crews must fly with a 
high degree of alertness 
should an enemy aircraft appear their warning from the hawkeye 
might be the first to alert fellow seamen manning the battle 
groups air defense weapons 
if we make an error a lot of people pay a big price if we 
dont find somebody or something thats on the way in smith said

world wheat production in 1990 is at record 
levels and expected to exceed consumption leading to the lowest 
us prices in two years according to the agriculture department 
the report released monday says us wheat supplies are 
forecast up 18 percent from last year to 33 billion bushels with 
consumption up only 8 percent enough to use 24 billion bushels 
this will lead to farm prices of about 1 per bushel less than 
last years 372 usda says 
record 1990 wheat crops are forecast in kansas and north 
dakota the two largest producing states pushing us production 
over 27 billion bushels for only the third time said the usda 
despite the large us crop and lower prices slack world 
imports and increased competitor supplies will lead to lower us 
exports this year said the department 
however those losses are expected to be more than offset by 
greater feed use domestically 
the general trade embargo against iraq sponsored by the united 
nations is expected to cut about 3 percent from us wheat and 
flour exports according to the department 
that country opposed by the united states for its invasion of 
kuwait has been the eighth largest importer of us wheat it has 
been the seventh largest importer of wheat from overall world 
sources

juice in glass containers rather than paper ones 
american grapefruit juice also is popular said porter and 
martine

juice and orange concentrate accounted for 795 million porter

us citizens who want to escape from kuwait 
by crossing the desert receive daily words of caution by radio from 
the state department 
the messages beamed by the voice of america and also carried by 
the british broadcasting corp change daily but in general advise 
americans to know the hazards of setting out across the desert 
the voa carries the messages hourly during the morning and 
evening hours in which the voice of america is beamed into the arab 
world 
the message being carried late monday said 
the us state department advises american citizens that the 
situation at this time in baghdad and kuwait is unclear iraqi 
officials have reinforced their statement that americans will be 
gathered and moved our embassies are in contact with american 
communities and advising them to stay in their homes we have 
had reports of individuals who have been able to cross the border 
without incident but there can be no guarantee for the safety of 
those attempting to cross we are aware that american citizens may 
be considering departure from kuwait via the desert we advise 
americans who are considering this route that there is a confirmed 
report that at least one person has died attempting to cross the 
desert there are also unconfirmed repeat unconfirmed rumors that 
others may have died attempting this route we believe american 
citizens should be aware of this information before attempting any 
overland travel out of kuwait 
the report referred to as confirmed involved a british national 
about 500 americans already have been able to sneak into saudi 
arabia penetrating lax iraqi security but a caravan of others who 
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat 
the clandestine departures reduced the number of civilian 
americans in kuwait to 2500 according to state department 
figures also stranded are 500 to 600 americans in iraq

polands move to democracy and a market 
economy is threatened by its foreign debt of nearly 41 billion at 
least part of which should be forgiven says the countrys new 
ambassador to washington 
if there would be danger of the polish reform breaking down 
because of debt that would have consequences in europe and maybe 
beyond ambassador kazimierz dziewanowski told a us chamber of 
commerce gathering monday 
the bush administration has opposed debt forgiveness in 
principle but there is some sentiment for it in congress about 3 
billion of the debt is owed us creditors 
the new government feels justified asking some debt forgiveness 
because the money was taken by the former regime and we do not 
know exactly what was done with it said dziewanowski who was a 
writer and journalist during the communist era 
the gulf crisis has complicated matters he said but poland is 
both optimistic and patient about prospects for obtaining at 
least some rescheduling of our debt payments 
he said it was an odd twist that iraq the target of a worldwide 
trade embargo during this difficult period of our economic 
reform is one of those few countries which owes us money 
about 500 million 
while taking issue with a report that the iraqi debt to poland 
was 3 billion the ambassador did not dispute that part 
represented arms shipments 
poland stands to lose another half billion dollars as a result 
of cuts in supplies of oncesubsidized soviet oil he said 
dziewanowski in washington less than a month told the chamber 
that poland is framing new lenient regulations for foreign 
investment under which we will try to meet foreign investors at 
least half way or maybe the greatest part of the way 
he said the new rules will provide for unlimited transfer of 
profits abroad end prescreening of investments in all but the 
most strategic industries allow up to 100 percent foreign 
ownership use of western accounting methods and simplify income 
tax at a 20 percent rate half the former level 
the 50000 minimum investment requirement will be dropped 
opening the doors to small polishamerican businesses the 
ambassador added 
an american chamber of commerce will be opened in poland by 
november it was announced

americans held by iraq arent the only hostages 
mothers and fathers sons and daughters and husbands and wives 
seeking word from those trapped overseas are captives in a waiting 
game that began when iraq invaded kuwait early this month 
president bushs decision monday to label the estimated 3000 
americans in iraq and kuwait hostages confirmed waiting families 
worst fears 
ive felt all the time that they were hostages said 
marjorie walterscheid of jacksboro texas her husband rainard 
52 is among 35 americans moved from a baghdad hotel to an 
undisclosed location 
iraq announced that some westerners have been placed near 
military targets as shields against us attack heightening fears 
among relatives 
what happens if theres a shooting war asked the rev edwin 
davis of koran la id like to be over there with them hold 
my daughters hand 
the 68yearold minister said hes haunted by visions of the 
ordeal facing his daughter kuwaiti soninlaw and their two 
teenage children 
when he tries to sleep he imagines the middle east heat and 
hears the helicopters that buzzed in the background the last time 
his daughter called home the night iraqi tanks swarmed into kuwait 
since the invasion little news has reached relatives in the 
united states state department officials have contacted some 
families others simply wait 
it scares me to death that the iraqis would try and use 
them as bargaining chips said kitty dooley of hopkinsville ky 
she last heard from her 40yearold son hours after iraqi troops 
arrived in kuwait city where he managed several fastfood 
restaurants 
jean pryor is one of the lucky ones after a roundabout trip a 
message from her daughter in kuwait made it home to pelham ala 
last week it said im fine i dont think im in danger they 
have moved me from the city to another province 
pryor who isnt sure who they are said the brief 
reassurance answered her prayers but it is now more than a week 
old persian gulf tensions have escalated 
i get up very early in the mornings so that by the time the 
news goes off at night my body goes to sleep said pryor whose 
daughter moved to kuwait three years ago but my heart is still 
awake it never sleeps 
iraqs official news agency said monday that westerners would be 
used to shield military targets against american attack the 
government also has warned that those who hide foreigners will face 
the severest punishment 
later iraq said the westerners would be freed only if the 
united states withdrew all troops and lifted an international trade 
embargo 
we have been reluctant to use the term hostage bush told 
the veterans of foreign wars in baltimore but when saddam 
hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens 
of many nations he holds against their will in return for 
concessions there can be little doubt that they are in fact 
hostages 
laureen utz aljazireh an american visiting relatives in 
minnesota when iraq invaded kuwait awaits news of her palestinian 
husband who worked in kuwait the way things are going i dont 
think the outcome is going to be very good she said 
we live by the tv now said lynda parker of vidor texas 
i live with a telephone in one hand and the remote control in the 
other her husband bobby 49 is a kuwait petroleum co worker

the tactic of putting civilians in harms way to 
deter attack has been used in 20thcentury combat by germany 
britain and the viet cong but scholars say saddam hussein is the 
first leader to announce it as a tactic 
the iraqi president said he would prevent more than 11000 
westerners from leaving iraq and kuwait until the united states 
withdraws from the persian gulf and lifts the blockade against his 
country 
they will be deployed at strategic military and industrial 
points in iraq to deter assault baghdad radio said over the 
weekend saddam said the presence of the foreigners with iraqi 
families at vital targets might prevent an attack 
us british and other forces have been massing in the gulf 
since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 and annexed it 
adam roberts professor of international relations at oxford 
university said husseins public announcement was not only highly 
irregular it was illegal in terms of the 1949 geneva convention iv 
on international rules in time of war iraq signed the convention 
although the international force in saudi arabia is not at war 
with iraq the westerners were detained as a result of iraqs 
invasion 
clause 28 of the convention reads the presence of protected 
persons may not be used to render certain points or areas immune 
from military operations protected persons in this context 
roberts said means civilians both local and foreign 
but he said there were several instances of countries using 
foreigners and civilians in this way the most recent was during 
the vietnam war 
early in the war he said the communist viet cong insurgents in 
south vietnam forced local civilians to march ahead of its troops 
to try to prevent enemy troops from opening fire 
during world war ii the germans placed allied prisoners of war 
on rooftops in occupied holland to deter allied bombers 
another case of human shields was disclosed by old official 
documents declassified last year this was britains minesweeping 
taxi used during the arab rebellion in 1939 during the british 
mandate over palestine 
the documents showed that taxis owned by known arab 
troublemakers were commandeered with their drivers and put at the 
head of british convoys in case the road was mined 
lord dufferin of ava who was then parliamentary undersecretary 
at the colonial office commented at the time british lives are 
being lost and i dont think we can protest squeamishly about 
measures taken by the men in the front line 
b j bond a professor of war studies at london university 
said he knew of no official human shield threat by a national 
leader in modern times 
donald watt professor of international history at the london 
school of economics said he believed there were cases during world 
war ii where the germans used civilians to drive over mine fields 
but as for using hostages as a kind of shield as an instrument 
of state policy you would have to go back an awfully long way 
he said 
watt said there had been a medieval custom whereby a person 
signing a treaty gave the other party a close relative as a 
hostage a guarantee of your word 
david capitanchik senior lecturer in politics at aberdeen 
university scotland said the human shield idea is standard 
practice for terrorist groups who take hostages they always place 
the hostages near the bombs 
but is it not easy to think of a case in this century of a 
government using human sandbags in this way it is not easy to 
recall a case where this is implemented as an act of state policy

john and linda disosway 
say whenever they plan to visit a national park on their vacation 
it catches fire 
the atlanta couple and their three children were among the 
thousands who flocked to yosemite valley on monday when roads 
reopened after two lightningcaused fires forced an 11day closure 
and scorched more than 36 square miles 
the 1130squaremile park in californias sierra nevada had 
closed aug 9 for the first time in its 100year history 
the fires were among 1300 lightningcaused blazes this month 
that have burned more than 420 square miles throughout the state 
which in its fourth year of drought 
we were in yellowstone right after it burned mrs disosway 
said mpnday referring to major fires in that park two years ago 
our timings off

an extreme rightwing member of parliament has 
proposed that palestinians be used as human shields against an 
iraqi attack much as iraqs saddam hussein plans to use westerners 
to deter a us assault 
we should take them palestinians and put them in front of 
the invading arab forces lawmaker rahaman zeevi told 
parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee on monday 
iraq repeatedly has threatened to attack israel if the jewish 
state moves against it saddam has warned that he will use chemical 
weapons to destroy half of israel 
zeevi denied in an interview on israels army radio that his 
proposal was comparable to the iraqi presidents threat to move 
westerners to iraqi military and industrial sites as shields 
against an american air attack 
we cannot be compared with saddam hussein said zeevi who 
founded the extreme rightwing moledet party and was assistant army 
chief of staff during the 1973 middle east war 
he grabs peaceminded citizens and turns them into a military 
operation zeevi said i am talking about a hostile population 
that has proved their hostility to us with everything they can for 
the past 33 months 
it was a reference to the palestinian uprising against israeli 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip launched in december 
1987 
an estimated 17 million palestinians live in the occupied 
territories 
zeevis moledet or homeland party advocates the transfer 
of all palestinians from israelioccupied lands it has two seats 
in israels 120member parliament and is not a member of prime 
minister yitzhak shamirs likud coalition

will a luxurious condominium project 
lose anything in translation when builders try to duplicate its 
design near a lake outside moscow 
victor malnev thinks not even though wood will be replaced by 
concrete and steel 
maybe it will even look nicer than here he said as he 
toured the four beaches condominium development on long island 
sound 
malnev is chairman of the soviet farm collective zavet ilyicha 
which jointly developing the suburban moscow project with senie 
kerschner international housing ltd of westport 
the 1000member collective will not only lease the land for the 
project but also provide produce for those living in the complex 
the first of its kind in the soviet union malnev said 
groundbreaking for the 130 million townhouse community 
designed to house foreign businessmen is scheduled for the end of 
september the first of 528 units to be built a finnish company 
are expected to be ready by next july 
the international residential community to be named rosinka is 
modeled on four beaches a 135unit condominium community 
consisting of threestory woodframe buildings and a network of 
wooden promenades and decks 
rosinkas threestory buildings will also have new englandstyle 
architecture but without wood because the building code does not 
permit flammable materials said dick williams project manager for 
kerschner 
instead rosinka will be constructed of concrete with a steel 
molding designed to look like the cedar clapboard on the condos at 
four beaches williams said the stairwell towers will be built of 
glass and concrete rather than pressuretreated wood 
since the project was announced in april at least 18 companies 
from the united states western europe and japan have reserved 
units said christopher senie secretary of the senie kerschner 
international 
apartment sizes at rosinka will range from 1248 square feet to 
2712 square feet for a twostory townhouse annual rents will 
range from 45000 to 82000

yemen on tuesday agreed it would turn away 
an iraqi oil tanker expected to arrive within hours the agreement 
followed an emergency security council meeting called on the matter 
us ambassador thomas pickering said the united states 
requested the emergency council meeting after it received 
information of the imminent arrival in yemen of the tanker which 
defied a us warship that fired across its bow saturday 
in the course of the evening the yemeni permanent 
representative told the council that yemen would adhere to the 
sanctions on iraqi goods imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait pickering said 
yemen the 15member councils only arab member had abstained 
from the sanctions vote but had joined with the council in 
declaring the iraqi annexation of kuwait null and void yemen 
had also abstained from an arab league vote on sanctions 
diplomats said the tanker would arrive in yemeni territorial 
waters within hours 
pickering said the council also accepted a us draft resolution 
that asked the united nations to define what force it would take to 
back up its embargo 
the british ambassador sir crispin tickell also said the 
yemeni representative agreed to turn away the tanker 
the council agreed to convene at an early date to consider 
the resolution pickering said the adjournment was to allow each of 
the 15 security council members to consult with their governments 
before the final vote 
a formal meeting was possible today or wednesday to adopt a 
resolution calling for international military action against iraq 
diplomats said 
the draft proposal that called for members to take all 
necessary action to enforce the un embargo against iraq it 
would authorize the deployment of maritime forces and the use of 
minimum force as may be necessary to verify the cargoes and 
destinations of all shipping and to ensure the strict 
enforcement of the embargo 
the cuban delegation also presented a separate proposal calling 
for the exclusion of foodstuffs medicine and medical assistance 
from the un embargo 
the united states has been criticized by some countries for 
policing the un embargo without council approval 
france and the soviet union are believed to be supportive while 
china is said to be wary but unlikely to block an enforcement 
resolution with a veto 
there is no exact precedent for the loose international military 
action currently contemplated diplomats close to the negotiations 
described the talks as complicated and requiring legal research 
the diplomats emphasized that the united states and britain were 
not seeking to invoke article 42 of the un charter providing for 
a unsponsored blockade to enforce sanctions 
that article has never been invoked the last un enforcement 
action was launched in korea in 1950 that operation however was 
placed under a us command and was not organized under article 42 
neither the united states nor britain they said wanted a un 
commander to organize their national military actions even a un 
flag could imply some unacceptable un supervision they said 
the only precedent for un enforcement of sanctions came in 
1966 when the security council called upon britain to prevent by 
force if necessary oil shipments to whiteruled rhodesia which 
later was the object of a broad embargo 
on aug 6 the security council adopted sweeping economic 
sanctions against iraq to punish the baghdad government for 
invading and occupying kuwait on aug 2 
the security council last met saturday night to condemn iraqs 
holding foreigners against their will it demanded their immediate 
release 
under chapter 7 article 42 of the un charter the security 
council is empowered to take military action to enforce its 
sanctions the charter provies that the council may take such 
action by air sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain 
or restore international peace and security 
such action it says may include a blockade

outspent outadvertised and trailing in 
the polls ann richards says her bid for governor is doing just 
fine 
ive really felt up in about the last two weeks the 
democratic nominee said were running on target except weve 
raised more money than i thought we would 
during those last two weeks her republican opponent 
oilmanrancher clayton williams has been thrown on the defensive 
by news reports questioning his business acumen and richards has 
pounced on the issue 
a hardhitting tv commercial that began airing friday portrays 
multimillionaire williams as a troubled businessman who misused 
employees is mired in debt and lawsuits and wants to keep it all 
secret 
lets look behind the screen on claytie tv the ad says 
the commercial was richards first postprimary television ad 
and came after weeks of battering from williams tv commercials 
williams aides called the 30second spot mudslinging and a sign 
of desperation 
the farther she falls behind in the polls the more bizarre a 
sideshow her campaign is becoming said gordon hensley williams 
press secretary mr williams is a man of honesty and integrity 
and the polls are showing that the voters of texas believe this to 
be the case 
williams on friday countered with his new 30second spot which 
accuses richards of wrongdoing in the savings and loan debacle 
the commercial suggests richards as state treasurer assisted 
sampl executives in getting state deposits accepted their political 
contributions and then destroyed records showing where state money 
was deposited 
richards said the ad is totally false and clayton williams 
and his campaign staff know it 
richards who gained wide recognition with her caustic keynote 
address at the 1988 democratic national convention survived a 
brutal primary and runoff but has trailed in the few polls made 
public since the most recent a survey of 821 texans taken aug 
58 for several tv stations showed williams ahead 49 percent to 38 
percent no margin of error was given 
the democrat said she isnt bothered by such numbers she said 
that the numbers are holding even though williams has been on 
television almost continuously since june 
but the polls also show a small number of undecided voters 
around 13 percent and some texas democrats have said privately 
they are worried 
with williams and the wellfunded sen phil gramm atop the 
republican ticket those democrats are wondering just which of 
their candidates down the ballot could be the stopper to a gop 
sweep 
williams has raised some 13 million and spent 113 million 
more than 6 million of that his own money according to july 1 
campaign finance reports richards reported raising and spending 
just under 6 million 
karl rove a republican consultant said richards has failed to 
offer any message beyond her new texas slogan shes 
determined to run a vacuous campaign he said shes not going 
to talk about substance or issues 
richards aides dispute that campaign consultant glenn smith 
said richards is exposing the real story behind williams tv image 
early in the race williams drew the wrath of womens groups 
when he likened bad weather to rape if its inevitable just 
relax and enjoy it williams said later he admitted visiting 
prostitutes as a young man 
for her part richards a recovering alcoholic was dogged 
during the primary by allegations of drug use she repeatedly 
refused to say whether she had ever used illegal drugs 
the focus turned to business after newspaper reports aug 5 said 
that williams net worth has fallen by almost twothirds since 
1982 when he estimated it at 300 million and that a researcher 
hired by one of his primary opponents said half the 26 companies he 
founded had been sold or dissolved 
i am not backing up one bit on my business record williams 
countered ive had companies that broke even that i didnt keep 
and some that were extremely successful 
the democrats have paired the attack on his business dealings 
with a demand that he make public his tax returns something he has 
refused to do 
williams recently said it would take a mack truck to carry 
his returns 
richards quickly sent a mack truck to his headquarters

the birthday party of the pilots daughter 
the singleengine plane crashed in a corn field late saturday 
and was discovered the next morning 
pilot jay her 31 of watertown was trying to earn flight time

i understand that thats what this person was doing and i also 
understand that it had to be done before midnight on saturday 
the rented piper lance was designed to carry a pilot and five

the rain 
the hmong family fled their native laos to thailand at the close 
of the vietnam war and made their way to florida before resettling 
in wisconsin 
the airport was unattended when her took off but baum said 
pilots are authorized to use the small airstrip after hours a 
search was launched after hers wife telephoned authorities sunday

president bush has signed legislation 
restricting state and federal log exports in an effort to save 
thousands of timber jobs and extend federal protection of the 
northern spotted owl 
bush said in signing the bill monday that there was no doubt 
that high levels of export of unprocessed timber have contributed 
to the decline in habitat that caused the northern spotted owl to 
be listed as threatened 
while i am supporting this provision because it assists in the 
preservation of critical habitat i also note that it will ease the 
economic transition in areas affected by the listing of the spotted 
owl bush said 
the log measure is intended to preserve the pacific northwests 
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough 
oldgrowth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction 
the bill makes permanent what had been a yeartoyear ban on the 
export of raw logs from federal land and imposes a new ban on state 
lands in california and oregon exports from stateowned land in 
washington would be reduced but not halted

a bustheads tellittothejudge cop survived 
two demotions to become police chief in the city with the nations 
highest crime rate 
mayor maynard jackson appointed eldrin bell on monday 
declaring eldrin bell is exactly what the doctor ordered 
despite reservations by some city officials about bells alleged 
lack of respect for the law the city council meeting minutes 
later dispensed with the usual confirmation process and 
unanimously approved the appointment 
we dont need to be messing around said council president 
marvin s arrington we need to put him on the job 
bell one of three deputy chiefs on the 1600member force 
takes over a police department with a big job in this city of about 
445000 
in 1989 atlanta reported 210 serious crimes for each 1000 
residents worst among us cities with a population of 300000 or 
more according to the fbi it was the second straight year atlanta 
posted the worst crime rate 
let the word go forth the 54yearold bell said at a news 
conference lawlessness and drug trafficking and gangs are not 
welcome in atlanta atlanta will not tolerate this kind of 
lawlessness 
bell who succeeds retiring chief morris redding stands to 
become the citys most powerful police chief in nearly 16 years 
the mayor eliminated a commissioner post superior to the police and 
fire chiefs earlier this year 
bell who has what the mayor called a welldeserved reputation 
as a tough cop got little support from the man he replaced 
redding who served eight years as chief rated bells 
dependability and moral standards as low although he said bell 
is a hard worker 
randolph w thrower who heads the city ethics board said bell 
does not reflect great respect for ethical considerations 
hilary l chiz executive director for the georgia chapter of 
the american civil liberties union said she had some concerns but 
the aclu wanted to work with the new chief on developing ways to 
deal with the very serious issues of crime without encroaching 
further on individual freedom 
bell 54 has served on the force for 29 years and twice was 
demoted from deputy chief 
in 1979 he was busted to major because of an investigation of 
police protection for gamblers at fairgrounds where bell did 
security work no charges were filed and he was reinstated 
in 1985 he was again demoted to lieutenant after he was among 
patrons at an italian restaurant where invited guests were targets 
of an fbi drug sting it was determined that bell hadnt been 
invited and wasnt under investigation 
bell once reportedly picked up a billy club phoned for an 
ambulance entered a crowded bar and fought seven suspects into 
submission he was investigated in 1984 for pistolwhipping a 
motorist he had stopped but a civilian panel police board and a 
federal court cleared him of using excessive force 
as commander of a crimeridden section of the city he was known 
for patrolling streets himself in the middle of the night and 
popping in unannounced at headquarters to make sure the night shift 
was answering calls promptly 
bell also was questioned in a 1975 promotion exam cheating 
scandal investigators concluded he wasnt involved but may have 
known about the cheating 
thrower who headed the investigation said bells evasiveness 
and failure to cooperate thwarted justice

a wisconsin appeals court has cleared the 
way for the start this fall of a program that pays poor milwaukee 
children state money to attend private school 
several groups including the states biggest teachers union 
had sought an injunction blocking the program while they appeal a 
dane county circuit court decision earlier this month that ruled it 
constitutional 
but the court of appeals on monday refused saying there was no 
evidence any irreparable harm would occur if the program went into 
effect 
the program the first of its kind in the united states offers 
2500 in tuition assistance for up to 1000 poor pupils to enroll 
in private school it is scheduled to start when fall classes begin 
in about two weeks 
supporters and opponents of the program have 19 days from monday 
to file briefs in the appeals case 
at the hearing charles clausen representing the wisconsin 
education association council and the other groups said the 
program was unconstitutional because the legislature failed to pass 
it as a separate bill it was an item in the budget bill 
but attorneys for the state six private schools and families 
who support the program defended the legislature arguing it acted 
decisively to improve the quality of education in urban areas 
about 400 pupils have been accepted by 10 private milwaukeearea 
schools participating in the program which won legislative 
approval in april

the government has raised the reward for 
the capture of the reputed leader of the medellin cocaine cartel to 
nearly 1 million the army says 
thousands of handbills offering the doubled bounty were dropped 
from army helicopters over the weekend in medellin according to a 
statement monday by gen harold bedoya the commander of the army 
brigade based in the city 
photographs of reputed cartel leader pablo escobar and other 
cartel leaders appeared on the handbills offering 500 million 
pesos nearly 1 million for information leading to escobars 
capture 
escobar wanted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges is also accused of masterminding several assassinations in 
colombia including the august 1989 killing of sen luis carlos 
galan galan a leading presidential contender was gunned down at 
a political rally outside of bogota 
after galans death the government began extraditing 
trafficking suspects and seizing their properties the cartel 
responded with a series of terrorist attacks that killed some 500 
people before the organization declared a unilateral ceasefire 
last month 
this is the second time the government has raised the reward for 
escobar since it intensified a crackdown on the cartel at the end 
of 1989 the army announced it was increasing the bounty to 
500000 from 250000 
the handbills also offered a reward of nearly 500000 for jorge 
luis ochoa considered by authorities to be the cartels 
secondincommand 
the latest increase seemed to reaffirm the governments decision 
not to deal with traffickers last week justice minister jaime 
giraldo angel said there would be no government negotiations with 
organized crime despite the cartels truce 
but the minister added that an end to terrorism would allow the 
government to end the extradition of accused drug traffickers the 
government has extradited 22 drug suspects since implementing the 
policy last year 
the medellin cartel which has been able to avoid colombian 
justice by bribing threatening and killing judges has tried both 
to force and to coax the government into abandoning extradition 
security forces have continued to pursue the cartels members 
those killed in shootouts with police include gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha called the most violent cartel figure john jairo arias the 
leader of the organizations gunmen and gustavo de jesus gaviria 
escobars first cousin and righthand man

yemen agreed today to turn away an iraqi 
oil tanker lending further support to usled efforts to enforce 
an international embargo on iraqi goods 
the agreement came in informal security council talks on 
possible military action to back up the sanctions convened at the 
united states urging 
the meeting which began monday was adjourned early this 
morning following the announcement of yemens decision 
us ambassador thomas pickering said the united states 
requested the meeting after receiving information of the imminent 
arrival of the iraqi tanker which saturday defied a us warship 
that fired across its bow 
in the course of the evening the yemeni permanent 
representative told the council that yemen would adhere to the 
sanctions on iraqi goods imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait pickering said 
the british ambassador sir crispin tickell said the yemeni 
representative agreed to turn away the tanker 
yemen the 15member councils only arab member had abstained 
from the sanctions vote but joined with the council in declaring 
iraqs annexation of kuwait null and void 
yemen also abstained from an arab league vote on sanctions 
diplomats said the tanker would arrive in yemeni waters within 
hours 
at the informal meeting the council also accepted a us draft 
resolution calling for international military action to back up the 
embargo of iraq 
the council agreed to convene at an early date to consider 
the resolution pickering said the adjournment would allow council 
members to consult with their governments before a final vote 
the us proposal called for members to take all necessary 
action to enforce the un embargo against iraq 
it would authorize the deployment of maritime forces and the use 
of minimum force as may be necessary to verify the cargoes and 
destinations of all shipping and to ensure the strict 
enforcement of the embargo 
the cuban delegation presented a separate proposal calling for 
the exclusion of foodstuffs medicine and medical assistance from 
the un embargo 
the united states has been criticized by some countries for 
policing the un embargo without council approval 
france and the soviet union are believed supportive while china 
is said to be wary but unlikely to block an enforcement resolution 
there is no exact precedent for the loose international military 
action currently contemplated 
diplomats said the united states and britain were not seeking to 
invoke article 42 of the un charter providing for a 
unsponsored blockade to enforce sanctions 
that article has never been invoked the last un enforcement 
action was launched in korea in 1950 that operation however was 
placed under a us command and was not organized under article 42 
the only precedent for un enforcement of sanctions came in 
1966 when the security council called upon britain to prevent by 
force if necessary oil shipments to whiteruled rhodesia later 
the object of a broad embargo 
on aug 6 the security council adopted sweeping economic 
sanctions against iraq to punish the baghdad government for its 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait and subsequent annexation of that nation 
the security council last met saturday to condemn iraqs holding 
foreigners against their will it demanded their immediate release 
under chapter 7 article 42 of the un charter the security 
council is empowered to take military action to enforce its 
sanctions the charter provies that the council may take such 
action by air sea or land forces as may be necessary to maintain 
or restore international peace and security 
such action it says may include a blockade

about 40 zairean students today ended a weeklong 
occupation of their embassy in beijing after getting assurances 
from their government that it would send promised living allowances 
and plane tickets home 
the students began returning to their schools after holding 
their ambassador and his staff hostage in the walled compound since 
aug 15 
the decision to leave was made after a 30minute phonecall from 
the zairean ambassador in belgium kimbulu moyanso who assured the 
students that approximately 187500 in unpaid living allowances 
would be forwarded to beijing within 10 days said qinghua 
university graduate ngolo kilubisha 
government funds from zaire a former belgian colony are first 
transferred to banks in belgium before being disbursed overseas 
most of the more than 80 zaire students in china have not been 
paid since june 1989 with some going without their zaire 
government subsidies for two years the students also get 54 per 
month from the chinese government 
the students today received a telex from their education 
minister asking for a breakdown of money owed to each student and 
other details of their complaints 
the students said the head of zaires culture center in belgium 
which is responsible for its students studying overseas is to come 
to beijing on thursday to talk with the students 
kilubisha said the students regarded these moves as signs the 
government was prepared to resolve their problems which also 
included failure to provide promised plane tickets home for 
graduates after fiveyear stays in china 
it was the second consecutive year the students have protested 
over the same problems last year they occupied the embassy for 10 
days until the zaire government refused to resolve the problems 
unless the students withdrew 
kilubisha said the students voted monday night to retreat but 
warned if we dont get any solution based on what theyve 
said we might come back 
the students had secured the gate of the walled embassy compound 
with a bicycle lock refusing to allow the ambassador or his staff 
out or the chinese staff in 
kilubish said the lock was removed and the embassy was operating 
normally today 
the zaireans are one of the largest groups of african students 
in china under friendship agreements signed in the 1960s china 
gives scholarships to students from many african countries to 
complete entire degree programs in china usually in the sciences

leftist guerrillas attacked an 
army barracks in the capital across the street from president 
alfredo cristianis residence five people were wounded in the 
battle the military said 
the military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the rebels used bombs hurled from homemade catapults and also 
mortars in the attack late monday but none of the rounds hit the 
barracks 
the barracks houses a military communication unit on the south 
side of the capital 
hundreds of army troops backed by helicopter gunships 
immediately cordoned off the area and exchanged automatic rifle 
fire for about 30 minutes with the rebels before the attackers 
withdrew shortly after nightfall 
the guerrillas also dynamited a halfdozen electrical towers 
leaving large areas in the southern part of the city without power 
radio stations reported that cristianis residence was hit by a 
mortar explosion but an official there denied this 
cristiani was not here at the time of the attack they did not 
attack the presidential house the official who also spoke on 
condition of anonymity said in a telephone interview 
this was an attack mainly against the civilian population 
one of the military sources said 
journalists who toured the area after the fighting saw at least 
three houses in the neighborhood damaged by guerrilla mortar fire 
red cross volunteers at the scene said they picked up five 
civilians wounded by shrapnel fire and rushed them to hospital 
the guerrilla attack came as peace talks in san jose the 
capital of neighboring costa rica stalled monday over rebel 
demands that the army be abolished and officers be punished for 
politically motivated murders 
oscar santamaria justice minister and head of the government 
delegation described the addition of new guerrilla demands since 
the july round of talks as a setback 
he said the new demands were not in accord with the 
seriousness of the peace process 
the rebel farabundo marti national liberation front submitted an 
18point document its first demand calls for the total 
demilitarization of society by means of disappearance of the two 
armies 
the rebels in previous rounds of talks had demanded trial and 
punishment of officers implicated in four noted human rights cases 
including the 1980 assassination of archbishop oscar romero and 
last novembers massacre by army troops of six jesuit priests 
their housekeeper and her daughter 
the new document adds demands for punishment of those 
responsible for two other cases as well as the murders 
massacres and bombardments of civilians that have occurred during 
the negotiations 
the document also demands investigations to determine 
responsibility for 20 other specific crimes in addition to all 
the crimes murders disappearances and massacres committed since 
1979 
more than 73000 people have been killed since the war began in 
october 1979 the majority of them civilians

former us sen lawton chiles his 
campaign for governor dogged by questions about his mental health 
released medical records that said he never contemplated suicide 
during his bouts with depression 
chiles 60 released the inchthick collection of records monday 
after calls for disclosure from his opponent 
at a news conference at which the records were released chiles 
physician dr karl hempel said the former senator has been 
treated for depression since 1987 
the condition which afflicts an estimated 4 percent of the 
adult us population can be debilitating and lead to suicide but 
chiles is less severely affected the doctor said 
hes never been suicidal from the very start said hempel 
i would definitely not tell him to retire he doesnt have 
anything that is even close to being disabling 
chiles is running against us rep bill nelson 47 for the 
democratic nomination in the sept 4 primary nelsons running 
mate tom gustafson suggested chiles could be suicidal as governor 
but later apologized for the remark 
campaigning on monday chiles said the records should put an 
end to questions about his mental and physical health 
republican gov bob martinez and chiles democratic opponent had 
earlier released complete medical records and nelson repeatedly 
urged chiles to do the same 
i think that my health is perhaps a legitimate issue chiles 
said adding that his daily campaigning shows that he is fit 
he had his first episode of depression following openheart 
surgery in 1985 but that was brief and resolved without treatment 
hempel told reporters 
the medical documents dating to 1966 showed that in 1987 chiles 
complained of insomnia and loss of appetite and sex drive common 
symptoms of depression he was treated with the antidepressant 
doxepin a month later chiles made the surprise announcement he 
wouldnt seek a fourth senate term 
in the evaluation dr rj pentzien a psychiatrist at bethesda 
naval hospital wrote there was no history of suicidal ideation 
plan or intent 
chiles was switched to the popular new antidepressant prozac in 
1989 by hempel the drugs makers deny claims in several lawsuits 
that it can spur suicidal tendencies 
hempel said chiles would be fine as long as he monitors his 
condition which is being treated with antidepression drugs to 
correct a chemical imbalance in the brain 
chiles who served in the legislature in a political career 
dating to 1959 said he released the records because he didnt want 
to appear to be hiding anything

mayor w wilson goode says philadelphia is 
not bankrupt and can avoid a disastrous 2064 million deficit if 
the state and city council work with him to raise taxes and cut 
spending 
these actions may be painful he said monday but had they 
been taken in the past as i recommended they would not be 
necessary now to avoid tough times ahead we cannot avoid tough 
choices today 
goode urged the legislature to give the city power to raises 
taxes by 150 million to be spread among consumers homeowners and 
businesses 
he also called for a freeze on hiring and a cut in all 
nonessential services which he did not list 
and he proposed the lease or sale of veterans stadium where the 
philadelphia phillies and eagles play and of other city assets 
including the water department 
goodes call for action came as his administration announced 
plans monday to borrow 400 million in temporary loan notes within 
the next two weeks 
without the notes the city would be out of cash by late 
september according to a report by city finance director betsy 
reveal 
even with the notes the city will be out of cash by may unless 
short and longterm measures are taken the report said 
goode accused previous administrations of taking stopgap 
measures to avoid crises he pointed to federal grants that have 
dried up and the recession gripping the northeast but he reserved 
the largest share of blame for the state 
the root of our dilemma is that philadelphias fiscal problems 
are primarily structural they are built into the state system 
he said 
gov robert p casey defended his administration saying he has 
substantially increased the states financial contribution to the 
city 
goode also blasted the city council noting it has repeatedly 
thwarted his attempts to raise taxes over the years

stealing and selling horses and saddles across the country has a 
name and its not slim tex or buffalo bill 
the alleged thief had been using the name of a man who died in 
january and authorities say he used as many as 35 aliases in the 
last seven years he used so many false names that officers who 
arrested him earlier this month couldnt determine his real 
identity 
that changed when an anonymous caller who had seen his picture 
in a newspaper fingered him sheriff jerry cox said monday 
the mystery man known for wearing outlandish cowboy outfits and 
calling everybody pardner was identified as john richard brink 
a 39yearold native of quincy ill cox said

admitted to the name changes 
he said ive done this for the last six or seven years

and wanted to know how i had done it 
brink is in jail on 160000 bail on burglary and theft charges 
he also faces charges in indiana and two other missouri counties 
cox said authorities in tennessee and pennsylvania want to 
question him 
investigators believe he traveled from new york to texas 
stealing horses riding tack and other goods to sell further down 
the road

federal prosecutors say they have launched 
a criminal investigation of northern californias bankruptcy courts 
us attorney william t mcgivern jr confirmed the probe the 
san francisco daily journal a law publication reported today 
over the last several months matters involving the practice 
of bankruptcy law in general have been referred to this office 
and are under investigation by the fbi and this office mcgivern 
said 
mcgivern declined to comment further but an assistant us 
attorney told the journal that the probe began at least three 
months ago at his instance 
i see obstruction of justice i see violations of bankruptcy 
statutes bankruptcy fraud the unidentified prosecutor was 
quoted as saying i am seriously concerned about the bankruptcy 
system 
the prosecutor said complaints in the past year came from 
debtors creditors and attorneys most of the cases involved 
chapter 11 reorganizations in which attorneys and trustees often 
have wide discretion over assets 
there is a club the prosecutor said if you are on the 
right side of the club you seem to win in the bankruptcy court if 
you are on the wrong side you seem to lose in the bankruptcy court 
it was my opinion that the little people were the ones that 
were getting the short end of the stick the people who couldnt 
afford to hire lawyers go in with some highpriced legal talent 
werent getting a fair shake

against nike to the athletic shoe companys doorstep but wasnt 
allowed into enemy territory 
nike executives on monday refused to meet with members of the 
chicagobased civil rights group continuing its defiance of pushs 
call for a national boycott of nike products 
push leader the rev tyrone crider said the group was in oregon 
for a meeting with nike brass but company spokeswoman liz dolan 
said earlier that nike informed push by telephone on friday that 
executives would not meet with crider

nike protesters wore tshirts that read say no to nike

iraqi forces near the kuwait border 
are in disarray reduced to stealing water and siphoning gasoline 
from civilian cars british intelligence sources have said 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said monday 
that capabilities of the 120000member force have been exaggerated 
they believe iraqi resupply lines are so inefficient that a 
fullscale invasion of saudi arabia is all but impossible some 
iraqi soldiers are as young as 16 
air vice marshal sandy wilson commander of british forces in 
saudi arabia said there is a danger of giving too much credit 
to saddams capabilities 
wilson said however he did not underestimate the 
professionalism of iraqi pilots the iraqis have a small number of 
soviet mig29 and french mirage f1 fighter aircraft 
britains 12 tornado f3 fighters are flying regularly with us 
and saudi warplanes the planes have made radar contact with iraqi 
aircraft wilson said but refused to give any details 
wilson said an integrated command structure has been established 
for the us british and saudi air forces although each remains 
under national command 
during flights the planes are coordinated and controlled by 
us and saudi awacs airborne early warning radar aircraft 
the multinational military buildup continues at dhahran in the 
kingdoms northeastern corner and every day the air defense shield 
is strengthened the sources said 
it is a comfort to me that as a result the iraqis ability 
to get chemical weapons through is increasingly reduced wilson 
said 
he described the shield as not invincible but pretty capable 
rapier antiaircraft missile batteries sent from britain were 
being held in cyprus because the british had decided the air 
defenses provided by the united states and saudi arabia were more 
than adequate wilson said 
british intelligence sources meanwhile described most of the 
iraqi troops dug in 10 to 15 miles behind the border as young and 
shaky 
their resupply lines are a shambles and they have been 
reduced to stealing water and siphoning petrol from civilian 
vehicles one intelligence source said

government and black leaders 
pleaded today for an end to tribal violence that has killed at 
least 399 people and they urged the warring factions to work 
together for peace 
foreign affairs minister pik botha met zulu leader mangosuthu 
buthelezi and gen bantu holomisa leader of the predominantly 
xhosa homeland of transkei to discuss fighting in black townships 
around johannesburg between zulus and xhosas 
the need whatever the cause is is to put an immediate end to 
the bloodshed all political leaders have a responsibility in this 
respect which they must accept by putting aside political 
objectives the leaders said in a statement they also called for 
church leaders to oppose the violence 
but the african national congress was not represented at the 
45minute meeting in pretoria zulus loyal to buthelezis 
conservative inkatha movement and mostly xhosa followers of the anc 
have been fighting since aug 12 
buthelezi was to meet later with president fw de klerk 
not only must the bloodshed cease the war of words must 
cease the statement said this has often been interprteted at 
grassroots level as license for violence 
the zulus and xhosas the countrys two largest black tribes 
have battled with guns machetes spears clubs and axes in the 
worst township violence in years 
a police spokeswoman said two cars and a house were burned today 
in the kwathema while police disarmed bands of zulus and xhosas 
who had gathered in tembiza 
groups continued to gather in tembiza lt ida van zweel said 
but no new violence there was reported 
also tuesday a bomb exploded in a car at a johannesburg hotel 
believed frequented by anc supporters the blast broke several 
windows but nobody was injured police said 
the bomb made of commercial explosives appeared similar to 
weapons used by extreme rightwing whites opposed to government 
moves toward sharing power with the black majority 
de klerk met last week with anc deputy president nelson mandela 
to seek a halt to the violence 
buthelezi and mandela have made separate calls in the past for 
an end to the violence but their followers have continued to fight 
police figures today raised the overall death toll in township 
violence to 399 since aug 12 including 120 in tokoza 112 in 
soweto 56 in kwathema 42 in katlehong and 38 in tembiza police 
said they found more bodies overnight 
the johannesburg clashes marked a spread of the political 
violence from eastern natal province where inkathaanc fighting 
has killed some 5000 blacks over the past five years 
the anc has rejected a direct meeting with buthelezi since 
fighting began in johannesburg mandela previously canceled a 
meeting with buthelezi earlier this year reportedly because of 
pressure from anc leaders in natal 
but buthelezi claimed today he had met with what he called top 
anc officials in recent weeks to discuss the violence he would not 
identify them he also criticized mandela for refusing to meet 
previously 
the anc contends buthelezi is trying to broaden inkathas 
constituency beyond natal by instigating violence against anc 
backers in the johannesburg area townships 
it also claims meeting with him would reward such a strategy by 
giving the zulu leader legitimacy as a power broker in the black 
opposition movement 
buthelezi and other inkatha leaders contend the anc is not 
willing to tolerate rivals and seeks to monopolize political power 
inkatha says it must be included in negotiations between the 
government and the anc on ending whiteminority rule 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid the system of racial 
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and 
economic control over 30 million blacks 
but the two groups differ over tactics and plans for a future

iraq has moved as many as 800 sovietbuilt or 
iraqimodified ballistic missiles into kuwait the editor of janes 
soviet intelligence review said today 
henry dodds said he had learned from a saudi arabian source 
monday that up to 36 missile launchers and as many as 800 missiles 
are in kuwait 
it was unclear he added whether the missiles were the soviet 
scud b which has been sold to iraq or the alhusayn a 
longerrange iraqi version 
there are 36 launchers in kuwait and they seem to be scud 
launchers dodds said in a telephone interview 
but there are also missiles being moved about on flatbed 
trucks unless you can get close enough to measure there is no way 
of telling the difference between scuds and alhusayns 
dodds said the alhusayn is based on the soviet scud b but its 
range of 400 miles is more than double the range of the soviet 
version 
obviously that will make a tremendous difference to the 
targets that the iraqis could hit if they decide to fire those 
missiles from kuwait dodds said 
he said the reported deployment was large but it obviously is 
not all the missiles the iraqis have got 
they would be foolish to move everything they have up into 
kuwait so one must only assume that they have possibly at least 
the same number again possibly more somewhere in iraq he said 
the american british and saudi air forces based at dhahran 
about 250 miles from kuwait would be well within the missiles 
range 
iraq first demonstrated its longerrange missile capability on 
feb 29 1988 when a missile struck the iranian capital of tehran 
about 400 miles from the iraqi border 
in its may issue janes soviet intelligence review said 189 
such missiles were fired at iranian cities in the seven succeeding 
weeks during the socalled war of the cities 
the soviet union first supplied scud b missiles to iraq in the 
early 1970s and delievered hundreds during the iraniraq war 
janes said 
according to iranian reports the alhusayns achieved their 
longer range partly by reducing the explosive payload from 1650 
pounds for a scud b to 418 pounds for an alhusayn 
many of the warheads used against iran were defective and did 
not explode janes said adding that the missile did not appear to 
highly accurate

sirens howled today to commemorate 
the 1968 warsaw pact invasion on the first anniversary that 
czechoslovaks were able to mark without fear of police retaliation 
in prague mayor jaroslav koran honored seven soviets who 
protested the invasion that ended the prague spring of 
liberalization and replaced it with more than two decades of 
hardline communism 
making the soviets honorary prague citizens koran told them 
their demonstration in moscows red square on aug 25 1968 
salvaged the conscience of their silent country 
they protested against the shameful treason committed by 
the tyrants of the day on a small friendly country koran 
declared 
the mayor acting on a city council declaration last week also 
formally stripped soviet dictator josef stalin of honorary 
citizenship along with czechoslovakias first communist president 
and gustav husak the communist party leader installed by moscow in 
the wake of the invasion 
present at the ceremonies was yelena bonner the widow of soviet 
dissident andrei sakharov who criticized the invasion 
bestowing the keys of the city to ms bonner koran declared 
shes always had the key to our hearts 
among the dignitaries gathered for the ceremony at city hall 
were soviet ambassador boris pankin and alexander dubcek the 
reformist communist party leader who engineered the 1968 reforms 
only to see them crushed by the invading tanks 
dubcek 69 who came back from more than two years of official 
disgrace to become speaker of the nations first free parliament 
since 1948 chatted affably with pankin 
their rapport was a striking example of the new reality in 
eastern europe where democracies have replaced monolithic 
communist rule in many countries 
just one year ago riot police waded into thousands of 
protesters commemorating the sovietled invasion and those who had 
fought it and calling for democracy 
less than three months later even larger protests led to the 
resignation of czechoslovakias communist government and subsequent 
free elections 
earlier today a t55 tank appeared in wenceslas square where 
weeping czechoslovaks pelted soviet armor with rocks and garbage 22 
years ago this time the spectators cheered 
the sovietmade tank was tipped onto its side by a crane and 
will be left standing through sept 6 
its belly bore the logos of solidarity the trade union movement 
that spearheaded democratization in poland and civic forum 
president vaclav havels political movement that guided 
czechoslovakias peaceful democratic revolution late last year 
at daybreak costumed members of the jester society student 
group swarmed through subway stations in a mock invasion of the 
city 
it was a normal working day and most people went about their 
morning business near wenceslas square only a few craned their 
necks to listen to a twominute cacophony of sirens at noon 
but some took time to reminisce 
marie kratochvilova related that she awoke aug 21 1968 to a 
commotion in a neighboring apartment she complained and found the 
neighbors making plans to flee the country 
youre snoring away happily and dont realize that the 
russians are occupying our country the 56yearold vendor 
recalled her neighbors as saying 
on monday civic forum condemned domestic communist leaders said 
to have invited foreign troops into the country in 1968 
we continue to support the demand that these people who 
committed high treason and are guilty of opposing peace be put to 
trial said a civic forum statement 
no charges have been lodged against any of the deposed 
leadership for their role in the invasion partially because of 
lack of evidence

more than two years after the first of 
nine murdered women was found near here a serial murder case 
involving drugs prostitution and now politics finally has its 
first official suspect 
a bristol county grand jury monday charged lawyer kenneth c 
ponte 40 with the april 27 1988 murder of rochelle clifford 
dopierla ponte said he was innocent but he welcomed the indictment 
because his name circulated publicly for months 
mr ponte recognizes the fact that he has a very very strong 
case before a trial jury his defense attorney kenneth reddington 
said at mondays bail hearing in bristol county superior court 
he needs a trial to clear his name 
dopierla was one of nine murder victims whose bodies were found 
along wooded roadways near this old whaling port city in 
southeastern massachusetts between july 1988 and april 1989 two 
other women are missing and presumed to be victims all had 
histories of drug abuse and some were prostitutes 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina portrayed ponte as 
an unstable cocaineaddicted man with violent tendencies pina 
said ponte used prostitutes or women with histories of drug 
involvement to buy drugs and dopierla was preparing to expose him 
the victim was going to come forward and be a witness against 
attorney ponte pina told superior court judge george hurd during 
the arraignment and bail hearing he began a pursuit of her the 
record will show he tried to prevent her from testifying he 
threatened to kill her 
pina was careful not to link ponte to the other killings but 
pontes lawyer said his client has been smeared in a 
guiltbyassociation prosecution 
this man has been under more intense pressure for the past six 
months than anyone i can imagine reddington said his law 
practice as you can well imagine your honor has been ruined 
at arraignment ponte pleaded absolutely not guilty in a 
loud clear voice hurd set a 50000 cash bail and ponte was 
released after his mother posted her house as security for bond 
after the hearing ponte said his indictment was simply 
political showmanship on the part of ron pina 
pina seeking reelection to a fourth term faces a sept 18 
democratic primary challenge by lawyer paul f walsh jr who has 
accused pina of political motivation in his handling of the case 
pina denied any political motive in the timing of the 
indictments saying of the grand jurors they dont work for 
me the 21member panel began meeting in march 1989 
it was pina who in 1984 prosecuted the widely publicized big 
dans tavern gang rape trial four were convicted two were 
acquitted of charges they cheered during the attack

an iraqi newspaper warned today of a 
harsh winter for western nations and suggested the united states 
might face economic collapse because of its involvement in the 
persian gulf 
the baghdadbased aliraq said fuel shortages would result from 
a un embargo and the usled naval blockade against iraq 
following its aug 2 invasion of kuwait the paper was quoted by 
the official iraqi news agency 
the daily said george bushs crime against the iraqi people 
led to cutting down the virtual supply of oil and the rise of its 
prices the matter which predicts that the united states and the 
west would see besides the harsh winter severe reductions and a 
fierce shock in the trade balance that might lead the american 
economy to total collapse said the agency monitored in nicosia 
it said the presence of us troops in saudi arabia had already 
cost the united states 12 billion it predicted the total by the 
end of the year would be 200 billion and warned the american 
people that they would face acute economic and financial hardhips 
as a result of their presidents rash adventure ina said 
in another editorial the government newspaper althawra said 
the iraqi decision to ban foreigners from traveling aims in its 
essence to avert big harm by the lesser harm ina said 
it said althawra praised the decision as one expressing the 
will of the iraqi people and their natural and legitimate right 
for selfdefense 
officials in baghdad say they are moving citizens of 
aggressive countries to areas at risk of attack by usled 
military forces sent to saudi arabia to defend that oilrich 
kingdom from iraq

union tass reported today 
soviet law officers will travel to karachi to escort the 
prisoners home the official news agency said quoting gulyam 
aliyev deputy kgb chairman in the uzbekistan republic aliyev did 
not say when the extradition would occur 
the aeroflot tupolev 154 jetliner with 29 passengers and nine 
crew members returned to the uzbekistan capital of tashkent on 
monday night tass said 
the prisoners armed with guns and homemade explosives 
overpowered their guards in midair on sunday and hijacked the plane 
to pakistan the plane landed at karachi international airport on 
monday with less than 15 minutes of fuel remaining 
airport officials said the hijackers surrendered about two hours 
after landing and sought political asylum 
there have been at least 13 hijackings or attempted hijackings 
of soviet aircraft since late may mostly by soviet teenagers or 
young men who said they wanted to live in western countries 
the latest incident began sunday when 15 prisoners were being 
transported from neryungry 3100 miles east of moscow to the 
nearby city of yakutsk in eastern siberia 
they forced the plane to return to neryungry where their labor 
camp was located officials said six prisoners and 41 women and 
children passengers left the plane there but two more convicts 
joined the hijackers said soviet interior ministry spokesman yuri 
i arshenevsky 
the plane then flew west to krasnoyarsk in siberia where 
authorities negotiated with the hijackers for two hours and allowed 
the plane to refuel the next stop was tashkent where a new crew 
came on board and the hijackers demanded to leave the country 
officials negotiated with them overnight before allowing the 
plane to take off for pakistan the independent news agency 
interfax said the hijackers promised to free the hostages on 
arrival 
kadyr atabayev inspector of uzbekistans civil aviation 
department told tass the convicts thoroughly searched the new 
crew before they could enter the plane

authorities atabayev said 
tass quoted deputy interior minister ivan shilov as saying there 
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to 
commandeer the plane the news agency said one of the prisoners 
apparently smuggled weapons onto the plane in an artificial limb

whether robert mapplethorpes sexual photos 
should be considered on their own or in the context of his other 
works was the question at a hearing on obscenity charges against a 
museum and its director 
municipal judge david j albanese considered arguments monday on 
a prosecution request to limit the case to five pictures identified 
in the indictment against the contemporary arts center and its 
director dennis barrie 
defense lawyers earlier had asked albanese to dismiss the 
misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity contending that the 
175picture exhibit seen as a whole could not be considered obscene 
albanese ended the hearing monday without issuing a ruling on 
either request 
the photographs in question monday depict homosexual sex acts 
one shows a man urinating into another mans mouth others picture 
objects inserted into mens anuses but other photos in the exhibit 
are closeups of flowers 
they are difficult images but they are important to 
understanding the artists approach said martin friedman 
director of the walker art center in minneapolis 
friedman testified for the defense that each picture in the 
exhibit had to be considered as part of the entire show he said 
the cincinnati gallerys contract required it to show all the 
pictures 
the whole purpose of an exhibition is to set up context 
friedman said you cant isolate some of the pictures and talk 
about the exhibition 
the judge asked a defense witnesses whether sexually explicit 
pictures were required as part of a survey of the late 
mapplethorpes life 
is there some danger if the gallery was just a vehicle for 
exhibiting erotic photographs for people who wanted to see erotic 
photographs albanese asked evan turner director of the 
cleveland museum of art 
i dont think any of the photographs in this exhibition fits 
that definition turner replied 
judith reisman a communications consultant who said she has 
studied sexually explicit photographs for the justice department 
testified that photographs viewed individually would have affected 
visitors 
but i go in to see the exhibit as a whole dont i asked 
defense lawyer h louis sirkin 
absolutely not absolutely not ms reisman said there 
are people who walked in and saw one picture and left 
the judge earlier ordered barrie and the gallery to stand trial 
sept 24 on one count involving pictures that show nude children 
the charge of using children in material involving nudity and 
the other of pandering to obscenity each would carry a maximum 
penalty of six months in jail and a 1000 fine for barrie the 
gallery could be fined 5000 on each charge 
albanese has not determined if the obscenity pandering count 
will be tried or whether the five photos can be judged separately 
from the rest in the show 
the mapplethorpe exhibit closed in cincinnati on may 26 it then 
moved to boston where it opened aug 2 at the institute for 
contemporary art

the accident occurred monday afternoon as the cruise ship regent 
sun was docked at skagway fire chief carl mulvihill said no 
passengers were in the lifeboat

a prosecutor says she will ask for as 
much prison time as possible for a 23yearold man convicted of 
leaving a jogger staked to the ground to die after raping and 
assaulting her 
this is one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this 
county onondaga county assistant district attorney mary felasco 
said monday after jurors found erwin williams guilty 
williams of syracuse was convicted of seconddegree attempted 
murder rape sexual abuse unlawful imprisonment assault and 
weapons possession 
felasco said she would seek consecutive sentences on the rape 
and attempted murder charges when williams is sentenced by state 
supreme court justice walter gorman on sept 5 
the evidence showed williams attempted to murder her after he 
raped her because she could identify him to police to me those 
are two separate crimes she said 
both charges carry sentences of 8 and onethird to 25 years 
defense attorney william rose argued before the jury monday that 
discrepancies in testimony raised a reasonable doubt about his 
clients guilt the jury took just 2 hours deliberating 
rose said williams admission to authorities was the most 
damaging piece of evidence even though he later refused to sign 
the statement 
defendants admissions similarly helped bring a conviction two 
days earlier in a 1989 rape and assault of a jogger in manhattans 
central park that case attracted national publicity attributed by 
many to the victims status as an investment banker who fell prey 
to youths engaged in a rampage they called wilding in central 
park 
the 43yearold suburban syracuse woman was attacked by two men 
four years ago in onondaga lake park she was beaten choked and 
stabbed 11 times and then shoelaces were used to tie her hands to 
sticks that were thrust into the ground 
but she managed to pull free and walk more than two miles with a 
knife protruding from her neck for help she recovered from her 
injuries and testified in a closed session of the trial 
also testifying against williams were his exwife gwendolyn 
williams and codefendant ronald jock 32 of brasher rose 
pointed out that jock testified as part of a deal in which he 
pleaded guilty to attempted murder last month in exchange for 
prosecutors agreeing to recommend a 7 to 14year sentence 
the defense attorney noted that ms williams came forward 
earlier this year only after authorities very conveniently set 
aside charges of child endangerment against her 
its kind of incredible that she waited four years to tell her 
story to police he added

iraq said today it is willing to negotiate a settlement to the 
persian gulf crisis but did not offer to withdraw its troops from 
kuwait and said that if a war breaks out america will lose and 
be humiliated 
we are ready to talk iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
said at a news conference in jordan my president made proposals 
that we are ready to put all the cards on the table at a un 
security council meeting 
however aziz said all regional issues including israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip must be settled 
according to the same principles 
when a reporter asked aziz if iraq was prepared to discuss 
withdrawing from kuwait which baghdad invaded on aug 2 he did 
not directly reply saying only that all issues in the persian gulf 
must be discussed 
in a statement on iraqi television directed to president bush 
iraqi president saddam hussein said today that foreign detainees 
are being treated well and are only being held to prevent an attack 
by usled forces 
the detention of the foreigners is a product of aggression 
against the arab nation and iraq saddam said president bush 
is the one carrying out that aggression along with his allies 
iraq has begun rounding up the thousands of foreigners in iraq 
and kuwait and placing them around military installations saddam 
insisted that what happened to the americans so far is the 
lightest possible treatment that is dictated by necessity even by 
american standards of human rights 
he said the presence of us troops in saudi arabia violates 
holy moslem sites there and that if a war occurs you are going 
to lose and you will be defeated and we will be the victors with 
the help of god 
saddams statement was read on television by an unidentified 
announcer and was translated by cable news network 
aziz said he had carried a message from saddam to jordanian 
officials but he declined to provide details iraq has been 
pressuring jordan to continue to allow iraqi goods to pass through 
jordans red sea port of aqaba the port has been a key loophole 
for iraq in its effort to break the embargo 
aziz denied that the foreigners were hostages calling them 
guests and warned against any attack on iraq or kuwait 
the americans have prepared the ground for a war of 
aggression if the americans think this is a vacation like they had 
in panama and grenada this will be a bloody conflict and america 
will lose and be humilitaed 
earlier today egypt urged saddam to withdraw iraqi troops from 
kuwait or face a war that will devour everything and britain 
said the west must strangle iraq economically despite its threats 
against foreign hostages 
president bush planned to order thousands of military reservists 
into active duty as early as today to bolster us forces depleted 
by the massive deployment of troops to protect saudi arabia from a 
possible iraqi attack 
in another sign of growing arab support for the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia syria confirmed today that it 
was contributing troops 
syria began today sending its military forces to participate 
in the defense of saudi arabia an official source said on 
condition of anonymity 
in the persian gulf defense secretary dick cheney met with 
saudi officials to share military intelligence and to discuss the 
possible sale of additional f15 fighters and heavy tanks to 
bolster the kingdoms defenses 
the international economic embargo against iraq got a boost from 
yemen today when that country assured the un security council it 
would turn away an iraqi oil tanker that had ignored warning shots 
fired by us warships 
but two iraqi oil tankers that had been turned away from saudi 
arabia last week were seen docked in yemens port of aden today 
raising new questions about yemens commitment to the embargo 
a port official said the alfao and the alqadissiyah tankers 
were docked when he arrived at work today diplomatic sources who 
also spoke on condition of anonymity said the tankers may have 
arrived before todays un session 
the security council deferred action on a proposal that 
multinational forces be allowed to use force to back up un 
sanctions bush has already authorized us ships to use minimum 
force to interdict iraqi vessels 
at the first major european gathering to deal with the persian 
gulf crisis the ninenation western european union decided today 
to send forces to the gulf and urged the security council to take 
measures to enforce the embargo 
the union effectively gave the goahead to three nations 
belgium the netherlands and italy to commit naval forces to the 
tense region a spanish official at the meeting said his nation 
will send four ships to the gulf 
iraq meanwhile has moved 800 ballistic missiles into kuwait in 
addition to the tens of thousands of troops and hundreds of tanks 
massed on the saudi border the editor of janes soviet 
intelligence review said in london today 
the editor henry dodds said some of the missiles have a range 
of 400 miles or far enough to hit us troops and major saudi 
cities 
with the united states building up its armed forces in saudi 
arabia and blocking iraqi ports with an armada of ships iraq has 
moved to use westerners stranded inside kuwait and iraq as human 
shields 
for the first time bush on monday publicly referred to the 
21000 westerners including 3000 americans and 4500 britons as 
hostages and demanded their release 
egypts hosni mubarak who has rallied arab opposition to the 
invasion today urged saddam iraqs president to withdraw his 
forces from kuwait 
in a statement read on stateowned tv and radio mubarak said he 
was making his appeal in the name of everything sacred on our 
arab soil in the name of islam the religion of peace in 
the name of arab nationalism in the name of every man woman 
and child on our arab land 
in the name of light good and right i appeal to president 
saddam hussein to save both man and entity in our arab world from a 
destructive war that will devour everything mubarak said god 
only knows what the terrifying outcome will be if war begins or 
how much damage there will be if the fire erupts taking us 
backward into total darkness and loss 
in london mrs thatcher said today that she will not negotiate 
to secure the release of the british citizens detained by iraq 
as president bush pointed out yesterday saddam hussein is 
trying in his tactics to hide behind western women and children and 
use them as human shields and use them as part of his 
negotiations she said at a news conference 
she called for another un resolution to authorize the use of 
military force to make the international embargo against iraq work

leopards and llamas and doves oh my 
those are among the exotic denizens of animal kingdom a pet 
store that serves as a zoo for urban children and home for show 
business animals 
in addition to the usual assortment of puppies kittens 
reptiles and fish the store has a leopard that stars in 
commercials a duck that used to appear on a childrens program and 
an organ grinders monkey that shares his cage with a toy fox 
terrier 
we have one rule about our exotic animals they have to be 
able to work said general manager steve maciontek that way 
they arent just sitting in their cages all the time thats not 
good for them 
so joshua the llama pulls a cart at parades luther the leopard 
appears in commercials and the 30odd doves in the store are 
rented out for weddings serving as centerpieces at the bride and 
grooms table 
maciontek said the 10000 squarefoot store has a special 
exhibitors license that allows it to house and display the 35 
exotic animals it rents out but never sells 
when theyre not earning their keep the stores animals serve 
as entertainment for customers and school children who visit the 
store for free tours 
when i get an inner city kid thats never been to a zoo and i 
see his eyes light when he sees the leopard it makes it all 
worthwhile maciontek said 
the store on the citys north side averages at least two tours a 
day during summer maciontek said the purpose is not only to expose 
children to animals but to teach them about caring for pets and 
exotic animals 
twice a month employees take animals to hospitals and nursing 
homes offering pet therapy to patients maciontek said 
what were trying to get across with our store is that animals 
are only as wild as we make them he said people are shocked 
when we go right into the cages to clean the animals and the 
leopard or the tiger licks our hands 
only one of the stores animals is endangered a rhinoceros 
hornbill named harriet the 10pound blackandorange horned bird 
is similar to a toucan 
federal officials inspect the store every year checking to see 
that the animal cages are large enough and that theyre being fed 
the right diet 
maciontek said the store occasionally gets complaints from 
animal rights activists who dont think traditionally wild animals 
should be in captivity but he contends that the animals are 
wellcared for and fare better than they might if they were in the 
jungle

syria iraqs main arab foe said today it 
was sending troops to saudi arabia to help defend the kingdom 
against a possible iraqi attack 
syria began today sending its military forces to participate 
in the defense of saudi arabia should the kingdom be exposed to an 
external aggression a government statement said 
saudi official sources sid last week that more than 1000 syrian 
soldiers already had already arrived in the kingdom 
damascus would not comment on the earlier report 
todays government statement was carried by state radio and the 
official news agency it did not say how many soldiers would be 
sent to the kingdom 
it said syria was complying to the arab decision taken at the 
last summit conference in cairo which provides for fulfilling saudi 
arabias request for assistance in defending itself 
at the summit in cairo earlier this month 12 of 21 arab league 
members resolved to send forces to saudi arabia and other persian 
gulf countries requesting help in defending against a possible 
iraqi attack the three other factors which prompted the decision 
the syrian statement said were syrias readiness to defend 
islams holy shrines its belief that the gulf region should not be 
left to the foreigners and that arab troops should replace these 
foreign forces there and its conviction that the move constitutes 
a national duty that prevente division in arab ranks 
syria has been a chief critic of western policy and especially 
us policy in the region 
its agreement to send troops may improve its relations with the 
west especially with britain which severed ties with damascus in 
1987 over alleged syrian involvement in an abortive attempt to blow 
up an israeli jetliner at londons heathrow airport 
syria also is condemned by the us state department as one of 
the countries that sponsor terrorism

there is plenty of consultation but the 
united states and other western countries are stopping short of 
allout coordination of their responses to iraqi initiatives in the 
persian gulf administration officials said tuesday 
it is not that we sit down and say lets make sure that we 
do exactly the same thing said one administration official who 
asked not to be identified 
the same official said there have been instances where american 
diplomats planning to meet with the iraqis had been told by their 
british and french counterparts you can speak for us too 
another example was the administrations rejection sunday of 
saddam husseins suggestion that he would free foreign nationals in 
iraq if president bush withdrew us forces from saudi arabia and a 
worldwide trade embargo against baghdad were lifted 
i cant tell you specifically how we discussed that over the 
weekend state department spokesman richard l boucher said 
but all throughout this crisis weve been in very close touch 
with other countries both at the united nations in capitals and 
in washington 
there are a variety of countries whose citizens are in similar 
circumstances and of course we have approached the iraqis 
jointly as well as consulted amongst ourselves 
the five permanent members of the united nations security 
council the united states china britain france and the soviet 
union are discussing the possibility of a joint military 
operation under un auspices 
when asked whether there were discussions about the iraqi demand 
that the embassies in kuwait be closed boucher said we have 
discussed this clearly with other governments and of course we 
work with other governments at the united nations but im not 
going to speculate at this point on what will happen either by the 
iraqis or what our reaction might be 
boucher also said that the iraqi announcement had absolutely 
no legal standing and that the united states would hold iraq 
accountable for its treatment of american diplomats britain and 
other european countries also said they rejected the iraqi demand 
in paris where the ninenation western european union decided 
tuesday to send forces to the persian gulf the organizations 
secretary general willem van eekelen said we in western europe 
see the need to act so that the united states is not left to have 
to do the job alone

embassies in kuwait by friday 
diplomats are to remain in place as representatives of our 
governments italian foreign minister gianni de michelis 
announced he said however that diplomats are not to use force to 
keep the missions open 
western europe initially offered an array of cautious responses 
to the persian gulf crisis but iraqi president saddam husseins 
plan to turn foreign nationals into iraqi hostages has drawn europe 
toward a tougher response 
french foreign minister roland dumas opened the meeting by 
calling the trapped westerners hostages saying their plight 
revolts us 
it was the first time france which has the second largest 
military force in the gulf after the united states referred to the

possible violations of the un embargo against iraq it did not 
elaborate 
despite a strong start in sending naval and air force units to 
help defend saudi arabia britain only belatedly joined the united

american troops stationed here before the 
huge buildup of the past two weeks are complaining they have not 
been issued suits designed to protect against chemical weapons 
all these guys coming in here get gas masks and the suits but 
we get nothing one air force airman said they are treating us 
as if we dont count 
a military spokesman said the shortage was discussed at a 
command staff briefing tuesday and more suits are expected to 
arrive on transport planes in the next few days 
even so the enlisted mens comments suggest how deep the fear 
of chemical weapons runs such weapons and iraqi president saddam 
husseins willingness to use them are prime topics of discussion 
among troops here 
its as much psychological as anything one of the men an 
air force master sergeant said of the protective suits we see 
everybody else with them and hear everything being said about 
iraqs gas and chemicals but we get nothing 
one air force sergeant stationed in saudi arabia the past nine 
months went as far as calling a news organization in the united 
states to voice his complaint 
i was just fed up with the bureaucracy the sergeant said 
monday why should my guys be left naked 
pentagon ground rules prohibit the use of troops names in news 
media pool dispatches from saudi arabia 
in brief interviews with a dozen men stationed here as part of a 
standing us military training operation just one said he had 
chemical gear 
i scrounged it up by cutting a deal the air force sergeant 
said 
the sergeant who called the states to complain said there are 
about 120 us military personnel stationed at the training 
mission most of them air force the men conduct training with the 
saudi military and also provide security communications and other 
logistical support to a small us compound on a saudi air base 
i dont have a suit i dont have a gas mask i dont have any 
of it an army sergeant said when asked whether he had the 
protective gear 
both saudi and american officials have said they doubted iraq 
has the capability to successfully use chemical weapons against the 
base iraqs missiles are not considered very accurate at long 
distances and the united states has deployed missilekilling 
patriot missile systems at strategic areas as a precaution also 
air force officials have predicted us or saudi fighters could 
intercept any iraqi planes that tried to cross into saudi territory 
but the men said they still would feel more comfortable with the 
antichemical gear and had requested it several times 
one said he was told gear for the men stationed here full time 
was aboard a c130 transport plane that arrived at their air base 
monday but when he went the plane the man said he was told the 
chemical suits and gear already had been taken somewhere 
somewhere but not here not for us he said

the united states will upgrade the saudi military 
arsenal of us f15 fighter jets and heavy tanks a senior 
pentagon official said tuesday as defense secretary dick cheney 
concluded a whirlwind mideast trip 
the official who spoke on condition on anonymity said no 
specific agreements were reached during cheneys visit with saudi 
king fahd and defense minister prince sultan 
but the iraqi threat to the oilrich desert kingdom and the 
need to upgrade the saudi arsenal in the face of iraqi president 
saddam husseins millionman army means the bush administration 
will consider selling the saudis highpowered f15c and f15d jet 
fighters as well as heavy tanks the official said 
the official refused to confirm a report that the vastly more 
sophisticated version of the fighter the f15e was also on the 
saudis wish list but he also declined to rule out such a sale 
such weaponry would have to be bought from the pentagons 
present stock to quickly bolster the saudi arsenal 
cheney heading back to washington at the end of a fourday tour 
of five persian gulf states told reporters traveling with him that 
the bush administration also favors increasing aid to egypt 
noting its very close relations with the united states 
cheney commended egypts active role in the middle east and said 
president bush and our government feel very strongly about 
increased military aid 
egypt receives about 13 billion a year in such aid 
cheney spoke after a 90minute meeting with youssef sabry 
abutaleb egypts defense minister he said he and abutaleb 
compared notes on the crisis created by iraqs aug 2 invasion 
and subsequent annexation of kuwait 
we hope that diplomatic efforts through the united nations and 
economic sanctions will ultimately force saddam to have to give 
up cheney said 
earlier cheney told reporters the saudis are facing a very 
large tank army just across the border in kuwait 
we have worked with the saudis in the past and basically 
what were doing on a shortterm basis is reinforcing their 
capabilities in these areas cheney said 
he refused to confirm the exact kind of tanks that are under 
discussion but noted that the saudis have some substantial air 
assets from the united states such as the f15cs and the f15ds 
the saudis earlier agreed to buy 3 billion worth of the 
pentagons most lethal tanks the m1a2 but they are not due for 
delivery until the mid1990s in the interim possible candidates 
for purchase could be the m1a1 version or the m60 tank 
the senior pentagon official speaking of the f15s and heavy 
tanks said the united states will move quickly to consider such 
requests bush already has waived a congressional limit to 
provide 12 more f15s to the saudis during the crisis 
cheney termed his swing through the persian gulf a successful 
one in that it had increased cooperation with arab states with 
which the united states had rather cool relations in the past 
cheney met with king fahd in the saudi capital of jiddah before 
flying to cairo pentagon spokesman pete williams described the 
meeting as a good positive discussion 
cheney arrived in jiddah late monday after a 15hour swing 
through five persian gulf nations to seek support for the usled 
military operation against iraqs occupation of kuwait he also met 
with the princes and sheiks who rule bahrain the united arab 
emirates oman and qatar 
on monday sheik zayed al nahyan president of the united arab 
emirates welcomed the presence in his nation of a squadron of 
c130 transport planes and its company of 575 american military 
personnel 
the gesture was an important show of cooperation from a gulf 
nation that had never publicly acknowledged any major us military 
presence on its soil

after following his father into cherry farming 
ray pleva figures tart cherries are in his blood theyre certainly 
in his sausage 
pleva is negotiating to go nationwide with his awardwinning 
cherrypecan pork sausage such success he hopes could rescue 
michigans tartcherry industry from doldrums caused by production 
exceeding demand 
daughter cindy the 198788 national cherry queen is credited 
for inspiring the sausage which prompts most people to make faces 
until they try it 
wed be talking about cherry industry problems at the dinner 
table and shed say boy it would be nice if we could have 
something new the idea just popped up he recalled i thought 
about it 7500 times 
finally he experimented he hit on the recipe 20 percent tart 
cherries 4 percent pecans the rest lean pork and spices in 
february 1988 the former cherry farmer started selling it at 
plevas meats a business he and wife marge run in cedar in 
leelanau county northwest of traverse city he says he is patenting 
the mixture which has only a subtle cherrynut flavor 
in 1989 the product received the michigan new product award 
was featured on cable news network and was honored at the national 
restaurant show in chicago he said he has shipped the product to 
49 states and is talking with national fastfood chains 
we think well have good news for cherry farmers soon he 
said referring to michigans 1100 growers who produce about 
threequarters of the nations tartcherry crop 
production of about 275 million pounds of tart cherries in 1987 
exceeded national demand by about 55 million pounds haunting 
growers for the next two seasons said dick johnston of the cherry 
marketing institute in okemos 
this season supply and demand are expected to even out he 
said but products like plevas could boost tart cherries share of 
the competitive fruit market he said 
pleva is expanding his cherrypecan line making a spicier 
italian cherry sausage cherry pepperoni and cherry sausage snack 
sticks he says his links are sources of vitamins a and c because 
of the cherry content and of fiber because of the nuts 
a grand rapids laboratory analysis showed his sausage links have 
77 calories per ounce nearly 60 of them from fat a conventional 
breakfast sausage has 119 calories per ounce nearly 95 from fat 
said allison boomer of the american dietetic association 
though plevas sausage has lower calories and fat she said 
it wouldnt be something id eat often to me sausage is like 
eating butter

armenias parliament debated a declaration of 
independence on tuesday and considered setting up its own army for 
protection from neighboring azerbaijan soviet media reported 
azerbaijans president responded by calling for sanctions 
against armenia and warning that his republic might be forced to 
take steps to guarantee its security the soviet news agency tass 
said 
armenia a predominantly christian republic and azerbaijan 
which is primarily moslem have been engaged in bloody conflict for 
more than two years over nagornokarabakh an enclave in azerbaijan 
with a predominantly armenian population 
the spiral of ethnic violence mixed with aspirations for 
independence has been a major problem for the kremlin president 
mikhail s gorbachev has repeatedly warned that such divisions 
endanger his program of economic and political reforms 
in the latest fighting armenian militants marching behind dump 
trucks attacked and burned the azerbaijani village of baganisairum 
on monday after driving off soviet troops tass reported one 
soviet officer was killed and four soldiers and four civilians 
were wounded in the attack tass said 
on tuesday the armenian supreme soviet met in the republics 
capital of yerevan about 1200 miles southeast of moscow to 
consider a declaration proclaiming armenia a sovereign 
independent and selfgoverned state the independent news service 
interfax reported 
one proposed chapter of the declaration calls for establishment 
of armenias own armed forces interior troops and public security 
units interfax said 
the proposed declaration would bar any foreign country from 
deploying military units on armenian territory without permission 
interfax said this would presumably include the soviet union 
soviet interior ministry troops are stationed in armenia and 
azerbaijan to try to keep the peace they have come under fire from 
both sides 
the soviet officer who was killed monday lt alexander lipatov 
had been promoted to deputy chief of staff of his battalion after 
the previous holder of that post capt sergei osetrov was killed 
in action 
ironically tass said osetrov fell protecting an armenian 
village from azerbaijani extremists while lipatov was killed by 
armenian terrorists attacking an azerbaijani village 
tass quoted major gen anatoly kirilyuk as saying the militants 
who attacked baganisairum were armed with field artillery 
mortars grenade launchers submachine guns and sniper rifles 
the gunmen burned down or ravaged every house in the village 
but its population had managed to escape in advance kirilyuk was 
quoted as saying the news agency did not say how many people lived 
in the village 
in another clash monday azerbaijani militants fired on two 
villages in armenias noemberyan region killing three people and 
wounding six tass said no details were provided 
in a speech broadcast over azerbaijani radio and television on 
tuesday azerbaijani president ayaz mutalibov accused gorbachev of 
footdragging on a decree to disband militant groups and confiscate 
their weapons 
gorbachev issued the decree in july giving militant groups 
until aug 9 to comply with the order to turn in their weapons and 
disband tass reported aug 11 that the deadline had been extended 
two months 
the entire course of events demands that real political legal 
and other sanctions be finally adopted against the armenian 
republic within the powers entrusted to the soviet president and 
government as is the case when the soviet constitution is 
violated mutalibov said 
he appeared to be calling for sanctions similar to the economic 
embargo imposed by the kremlin on lithuania after the baltic 
republic declared itself independent in march

a pet cat named boogs who faced execution 
as a dangerous animal has won a court reprieve after his plight 
became the subject of a letterwriting campaign 
a state judge lifted the death sentence monday but ordered 
boogs owner to keep the cat on a leash and muzzled or in a cage 
when outside his home and to keep the cats rabies shots up to 
date 
about a dozen of boogs supporters applauded after dane county 
circuit judge susan steingass announced her decision 
im bitter but my bitterness is outweighed by the joy of 
getting boogs back said boogs owner dw wanberg a 
34yearold theater lighting designer 
the 6yearold grey and white cat had been on death row at the 
dane county animal shelter for 15 months city health department 
officials had ordered the cat put to death for growling at 
neighbors eating a neighbor cats food and nipping an animal 
control officer who picked him up 
officials also said the cat had menaced and bitten other people 
wanberg said workers at the shelter had denied him the right to 
visit boogs he argued that the citys actions were too extreme 
pit bulls can be a danger to life but not my cat he said 
there was no word on boogs reaction to being released wanberg 
did not answer his telephone tuesday 
mrs steingass said the stipulations regarding the caging or 
leashing and muzzling of boogs were necessary because of concerns 
about the way boogs has interacted in society 
the settlement capped a letterwriting campaign to the judge by 
boogs backers including inmates at the waupun correctional 
institution and a woman in puerto rico 
we are willing to take boogs in and make a home for him that 
is if warden gary mccaughtry approves said a letter signed by 
eight inmates at the prison in northeastern wisconsin 
elba nieves who heard of boogs situation through news reports 
wrote from puerto rico that she did not consider boogs to be a 
menacing cat 
people suffering from hunger sometimes steal to eat she 
said im not justifying this but give boogs a chance 
the citys lawyer carolyn hogg argued officials were right to 
confine boogs because they have a duty to protect residents from 
dangerous pets 
but boogs lawyer john hansen said the law does not allow city 
officials to kill pets simply because the health director decides 
an animal is dangerous

supreme court nominee david h souter should 
not be treated as a politician and asked about his personal views 
on supreme court rulings a conservative group that backs him said 
tuesday 
we dont think its proper that judge souter act like a 
congressional candidate and say read my lips ill do this 
said tom jipping of coalitions for america 
jipping said the senate judiciary committee which is to begin 
confirmation hearings for souter on sept 13 should not demand 
he bias himself in public on issues he would deal with as a high 
court member 
jipping author of an analysis of souters work as a longtime 
member of the new hampshire supreme court said the committee 
should conduct a properly focused investigation before 
confirming his nomination 
liberal groups especially those advocating abortion rights 
have been urging the senate to grill souter about his largely 
unknown views on issues the court is deeply divided over such as 
abortion churchstate relations and affirmative action 
but jipping urged the senate not to repeat the shameless 
treatment in 1987 of failed supreme court nominee robert h bork 
in fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent 
the senate in 1987 shifted radically from examining qualifications 
to checking out a nominees politics from conducting a searching 
inquiry into judicial philosophy to narrowly testing how a nominee 
would vote once on the bench jipping said 
this is not only a dangerous aberration from traditional 
practice it directly threatens the independence of the judiciary 
and literally demands that a nominee bias himself in public on 
issues that may well come before him as a judge he added

the leader of the secondlargest party in the 
east german parliament said today he was resigning and a plan to 
merge the german states on oct 14 appeared in danger 
earlier today prime minister lothar de maiziere said the 
leaders of all the major political parties had agreed that east 
germany would unite with west germany on oct 14 
richard schroeder leader of the leftleaning social democrat 
faction in parliament was among those who agreed to the proposal 
but members of his party later balked and said german unity should 
take place on or before sept 15 because of the countrys chaotic 
economic situation 
the social democrats who withdrew from de maizieres broad 
governing coalition on sunday in a dispute over unification met to 
discuss what action to take 
before the meeting schroeder said he was resigning as chief of 
his faction in parliament 
the opposition needs an opposition leader he said 
indicating he was closer to agreement with de maiziere than with 
his fellow social democrats 
the change was yet another example of the chaos in the young 
inexperienced democratic government as it tries to deal with 
mounting joblessness and falling industrial production 
six ministers have resigned or been ousted from the cabinet in 
the past week and the head of the agency set up to sell the 
nations ailing enterprises resigned amid criticism of his failure 
to unload the businesses 
after the oct 14 compromise was announced by de maiziere at a 
press conference social democrat spokesman juergen itzfeldt said 
the date for unity is too far away 
itzfeldt said it was possible the social democrats would try to 
set an earlier date during the parliament meeting on wednesday 
however they are not believed to have enough votes to challenge de 
maizieres christian democrats 
parliament must approve unification by a twothirds majority but 
only a simple majority is needed to set a date all the major 
parties are committed to unification but the debate has been 
reduced to a political brawl over when it should take place 
for weeks the leftleaning social democrats and the 
conservative christian democrats have argued over the date when 
formal unification should take place 
the dispute outraged many east germans who are more concerned 
about whether they will lose their jobs and homes and be able to 
pay steadily rising food prices caused by the switch to a free 
market economy 
de maiziere called todays meeting of party leaders in the 
latest attempt to settle the political brawl

the white house said today the united 
states had no interest in negotiating with president saddam hussein 
while iraq remains in kuwait president bush meanwhile awaited 
paperwork from the pentagon to activate us military reserves 
saddams latest message directed to bush and read over iraqi 
television was described by presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater as much of the same rhetoric that weve heard before 
same old litany from iraq 
at this point we see very little to talk about when all we 
get are negative responses fitzwater told reporters accompanying 
bush to a political fundraising golf tournament 
fitzwater also said there would be no announcement today on the 
pending callup of us military reserves white house officials 
said earlier in the day the executive order for bush to sign was 
making its way through the bureaucracy from the pentagon 
the callup which would primarily help fill the ranks of 
military doctors cargo handlers and other specialists could come 
wednesday after bush meets with defense advisers 
asked about iraqs suggestion for talks fitzwater said that 
many nations of the world are willing to talk with iraq but only 
in the context of compliance with the un resolutions which 
demand a full pullout of iraqi military forces from kuwait 
we demand a complete and unconditional withdrawal fitzwater 
said 
in amman jordan iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz said we 
are ready to talk however aziz said all regional issues 
including israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip must 
be on the table 
us envoy joseph wilson met with the iraqi foreign ministry on 
monday and demanded access to the us citizens who are being held 
by the iraqis and demanded they be allowed to leave 
of course he got no positive response fitzwater said 
fitzwater said that 18 dependents of american diplomats managed 
to escape on monday 
fitzwater also said the united states continues to shadow 
several ships in the persian gulf region to make sure none violates 
the trade embargo with iraq however he said one iraqi tanker was 
being allowed to dock in a yemen port based on assurances from the 
yemeni government that that country would not unload or use iraqi 
oil 
that tanker and another were being tailed by the us navy 
which had fired shots across their bow the second tanker was still 
being trailed fitzwater said 
president bush rebuffed reporters attempts to question him as 
he teed off for the golf tournament to benefit the reelection 
campaign of gov john mckernan 
however to underscore that bush is conducting work during his 
lengthy vacation in maine fitzwater said the president had spoken 
by phone this morning with un ambasssador thomas pickering and 
national security adviser brent scowcroft 
defense secretary dick cheney returning from the persian gulf 
and joint chiefs of staff chairman gen colin powell were to meet 
with bush in maine on wednesday fitzwater said 
the president escalated the verbal war during a trip monday to 
washington baltimore and rhode island he used the word 
hostages for the first time to describe the 3000 americans 
trapped in iraq and kuwait and called iraqi president saddam 
hussein a man of evil standing against human life itself 
starting his day with an early morning jog today bush kept his 
distance from watching reporters who wanted to question him about 
persian gulf developments bush has grown increasingly distant from 
news media accompanying him on vacation saying he does not want to 
comment on serious world affairs while having recreation time 
white house aides had said monday night the president might sign 
paperwork as soon as today ordering thousands of military 
reservists into active duty to bolster us forces depleted by the 
massive deployment of troops to protect saudi arabia from possible 
attack by iraq 
the white house announced friday that bush had decided to use 
the reserves 
bush returned to maine on monday afternoon and was spending much 
of today in falmouth he also planned to attend the funeral in 
kennebunkport of his uncle john walker a retired surgeon and 
investment banker who died thursday at 81 after suffering an 
aneurism 
bush spent part of monday on the telephone with foreign leaders 
prime minister margaret thatcher of great britain president 
francois mitterrand of france and turkeys president turgut ozal 
he praised all three for cooperating with the united states as 
it blockades ships that attempt to break the trade embargo against 
iraq he said strategically placed turkey took a courageous 
stand in going against iraq its powerful neighbor 
defense secretary dick cheney was returning to the united states 
today claiming success after a fourday trip to six mideast 
countries seeking their support the united arab emirates agreed to 
host a squadron of us military transport planes

for many weary east german workers the oct 
14 unification date set by their government tuesday is far too late 
it should happen more quickly we all want to work but our 
government cant do anything said construction worker horst 
schwaebisch 
earlier prime minister lothar de maiziere announced that 
leaders of parliamentary factions had agreed to the oct 14 date 
however a political squabble later threatened to torpedo the 
agreement and one of east germanys parties said it would push for 
earlier unification 
from the rusty bridge they were repairing schwaebisch and his 
crew could see the west german flag flutter atop the reichstag the 
historic site of the german parliament 
unity 
elsewhere in east berlin many expressed a similar opinion

eleven convicts from a siberian labor 
camp who hijacked a soviet jetliner to pakistan and requested 
political asylum will go on trial here the staterun television 
said tuesday 
however the soviet news agency tass reported that the hijackers 
would be extradited to the soviet union there was no explanation 
for the differing the reports 
the soviets surrendered monday two hours after the aeroflot 
tupolev 154 with 29 passengers and nine crew members landed in 
the city of karachi 
the late evening news on pakistans official television network 
said the hijackers were being interrogated and would be put on 
trial in pakistan a foreign office spokesman said no formal 
extradition request had been received from moscow 
earlier tass quoted gulyam aliyev deputy kgb chairman in the 
uzbekistan republic of the soviet union as saying soviet law 
officers would travel to karachi to escort the prisoners home 
pakistan has in the past refused to extradite hijackers 
preferring to put them on trial here palestinian guerrillas 
involved in a 1986 pan am hijacking that ended in karachi were 
tried in pakistan one was sentenced to death and the others to 
lengthy prison terms the death sentence has not been carried out 
the soviet hijacking began sunday when convicts from a siberian 
labor camp overpowered their guards and took over the jetliner as 
it was flying from neryungry where the prison is located to the 
nearby city of yakutsk 
the prisoners forced the commerical aircraft back to neryungry 
where six prisoners and 41 women and children left the plane two 
more convicts then boarded and the aircraft flew west to 
krasnoyarsk in siberia 
after two hours of negotiations the aircraft was refueled and 
flew to the soviet city of tashkent where a new crew came on board 
and the hijackers demanded to leave the country 
they originally wanted to go to new delhi but were allowed to 
land in karachi because the plane was low on fuel 
there have been at least 13 hijackings or attempted hijackings 
of soviet aircraft since late may 
tass quoted deputy interior minister ivan shilov as saying there 
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to 
commandeer the plane the news agency said one of the prisoners 
apparently smuggled weapons onto the fight in an artificial limb

the rev jesse jackson said today he is trying 
to arrange a trip to iraq as a television journalist to interview 
iraqi officials and american hostages for his new syndicated talk 
show 
jackson told reporters the government of iraq had indicated that 
he could interview officials in baghdad and talk to americans held 
hostages in that country 
the jesse jackson show which is schecduled to begin next 
month is syndicated by timewarner inc which jackson said would 
help underwrite the trip 
jackson who previously has played a role as a diplomat in 
seeking to free an american pilot held in syria said the purpose 
of the trip to iraq would be purely journalistic 
our purpose will be to communicate with high iraqi officials 
and to communicate with americans held hostage there just as 
various news organizations have sought to do jackson told a news 
conference 
it would not be appropriate to go there as a diplomat he 
said 
in this case it would interfere with what is a growing 
crisis said jackson who in 1984 traveled to syria to gain the 
release of lt robert goodman a navy pilot who had been shot down 
but jackson indicated that he hoped his trip would help 
encourage a diplomatic solution 
something must happen hopefully through communications and 
dialogue that will help break the cycle that is leading to an 
impending disaster unless it breaks jackson said 
we are not certain just yet as to what our governments plans 
are for that area jackson said if on the one hand it is 
military deterrence and diplomatic initiatives then communications 
could facilitate a level of dialogue that appears to be closing 
if in fact the american mission is an offensive military 
effort then even communications would be challenged jackson 
said 
jackson stressed that the trip would be a newsgathering effort 
the american people here have a great interest in seeing and 
hearing from their loved ones who are now held hostage and captive 
in iraq and in kuwait jackson said 
we have received communications from the iraqi government that 
communicating with high iraqi officials and the americans held 
hostages there would be possible jackson said

east germanys unruly political factions 
briefly put aside their differences tuesday and set an oct 14 date 
to unify the troubled nation with west germany 
but hours later the social democatic party said it wanted the 
date set a month earlier and would challenge the agreement richard 
schroeder the social democratic leader who had agreed to the oct 
14 date resigned as chief of his faction in parliament 
the social democrats were meeting to assess whether they could 
muster the votes to torpedo the oct 14 arrangement worked out by 
prime minister lothar de maizieres broad coalition government 
de maiziere is seeking a definitive timetable for the merger of 
the german states and the dissolution of economically battered east 
germany 
under the agreement the two german states will legally become a 
single nation oct 14 germans on both sides are tentatively set to 
elect a common government in december 
after meeting with the leaders of other parties in parliament 
de maiziere said lawmakers would convene oct 9 to formalize the 
unification date this was before schroeder announced his move 
oct 9 is the first anniversary of a large demonstration in 
leipzig east germany which fueled other prodemocracy protests 
the demonstrations spread across the country eventually bringing 
down the communist regime that had ruled four decades 
alluding to the attempt by lawmakers to capture the spirit of 
grassroots solidarity that toppled the old regime de maiziere 
said parliament will convene under the motto where we come from 
where we want to go 
de maizieres conservative christian democrats the nations 
secondlargest party and the leftleaning social democrats who 
abandoned de maizeires coalition two days ago agreed on the 
october date also agreeing were the former communists the 
thirdlargest party in parliament and the small buendnis 90 
coalition that includes the intellectuals and activists who led 
last years revolt 
the basic position of the social democrats was that unification 
should take place sept 15 because of east germanys serious 
economic problems 
christian democrats in both german states wanted to keep the 
date of unification and elections for a united parliament as close 
together as possible 
the social democrats said this was because christian democrats 
including west german chancellor helmut kohl were trying to win 
the election before west germans realized the true cost of bailing 
out east germany 
dec 2 has been scheduled for elections for a united parliament 
many details remain to be worked out the fighting between 
political parties in both germanys essentially in the throes of an 
election campaign will likely resurface 
how to distribute east german property some of which is 
claimed by west germans who fled the region after the soviet 
invasion of world war ii has been a roadblock to a political 
treaty that is to mesh the two countries 
east germany became a free market july 1 joblessness has since 
skyrocketed as enterprises struggle to compete with western 
competition 
regine hildebrandt a social democrat who resigned as labor 
minister tuesday in keeping with her partys decision to leave de 
maizieres government said 25000 east germans are losing their 
jobs weekly 
unemployment was pegged officially at about 270000 at the end 
of july but more than a million people are being kept on payrolls 
at reduced hours and wages under a program financed by west germany 
joblessness is expected to exceed 3 million of the nations 88 
million workers unrest among workers has been widespread 
sirens screamed around the prime ministers office tuesday as 
about 1000 public employees including firefighters and ambulance 
drivers rallied outside to demand better wages bus drivers joined 
by parking their vehicles for an hour 
several hundred doctors and nurses protested in front of the 
health ministry to demand that their clinics be privatized similar 
protests were held in cottbus dresden and other cities

the state department said today a us citizen 
in kuwait was taken from his home by the iraqi military increasing 
the number of americans believed under iraqi control to 54 some 
westerners have been moved to iraqi industrial installations the 
department said 
department spokesman richard boucher said the unidentified 
american and eight british citizens were rounded up from their 
homes by iraqi soldiers who apparently forced a kuwaiti man at 
gunpoint to identify homes of westerners 
boucher said the american was taken to the meridien hotel in 
kuwait where he was seen by us consular officials who said he 
was okay 
we have credible reports that some westerners have been moved 
to iraqi industrial installations boucher said he said he did 
not know the number or whether any of them were americans 
boucher also said the department had confirmed a report that 
eight american citizens crossed the border from kuwait into saudia 
arabia on monday he said they evidently acted on their own 
without any approval from iraqi authorities 
the united states will continue to press iraq by all means 
available to fulfill its obligation to the safety and welfare of 
foreign citizens in kuwait and iraq by allowing them to leave 
boucher said the united states will not negotiate concessions in 
return for what is an international obligation on the part of 
iraq 
boucher also said 18 us diplomats had driven across the border 
from iraq into jordan leaving about 10 in the american embassy in 
baghdad 
earlier boucher said the united states was protesting the 
removal of 12 to 14 americans and other foreign nationals from 
kuwaiti hotels to undisclosed locations 
boucher said monday that at least one family was among the 
americans taken from two hotels in kuwait city he said he did not 
know if there were any children 
thirtyfive americans taken earlier from kuwait and placed in 
the rashid hotel in baghdad were removed last week and boucher 
said they remain unaccounted for despite repeated us inquiries 
six americans were already living in the hotel and boucher said 
they have not been heard from 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said at least 12 and possibly 14 americans were taken from the 
hyatt regency and the kuwait international hotels 
the whereabouts of the americans was unknown boucher said they 
are among an estimated 2500 americans in the persian gulf country 
that was overrun by iraqi forces aug 2 
an additional 530 or so americans are trapped in iraq and 
boucher said securing all the americans safety was the 
administrations prime concern 
iraq announced it had carried out a plan to move western 
hostages to vital military installations to deter any us attack 
it warned iraqi citizens not to try to hide any of the thousands of 
foreigners trapped in the country 
president bush referred to the trapped americans as hostages for 
the first time monday while addressing a veterans of foreign wars 
meeting in baltimore 
whatever these innocent people are called they are in fact 
hostages bush said previously the administration had avoided 
using that word 
a state department spokeswoman said us consular officers are 
answering about 4000 telephone calls a day from relatives of the 
americans 
judith baroody press officer for the special task force set up 
by the department to deal with the persian gulf crisis said from 
60 to 80 officers staff the telephone bank 24 hours a day in 
shifts of 15 at one time the telephone number is 202 6470900 
the state department also announced that nonessential diplomats 
and dependents are leaving jordan which borders iraq the 
department said there are about 5000 americans in jordan 4700 
private citizens and the rest official 
nongovernment americans in jordan were advised to consider 
leaving similar instructions were issued for yemen which lies far 
beyond iraq on the arabian sea

hang gliders are swooping down over isolated 
forest areas to report illegal dumping maverick skeet shooters and 
possible arsonist activity in aerial spying that has authorities 
delighted 
members of the sylmar hang gliding association hope they will 
deter people from dumping stolen cars over the sides of cliffs and 
shooting guns illegally in the angeles national forest said group 
spokesman rome dodson 
i hate to see couches and stoves dumped up here because its 
such a beautiful area said member robert laukka 28 of thousand 
oaks 
the watch group was started to try to change the image of hang 
gliders as dangerloving and foolhardy 
if our watch stops one person from doing something wrong it 
will be worth it dodson said 
the club launched its anticrime effort friday soaring through 
the air with cameras in hand thousands of feet above the ground 
they take pictures of cars in isolated areas with lightweight 
disposable cameras dodson said 
records of the vehicles will be kept and if theres a fire

chief of air operations for the los angeles county fire department 
whatever these folks can do we appreciate it 
ninetythree fires have burned so far this summer in the 
690000acre forest said spokesman jim stump twenty of those 
fires were started by arsonists who have not been captured 
its been a bad year in terms of number of fires started but 
weve been lucky only 1735 acres have burned stump said 
every little bit the hang gliders can do helps 
watching out for arsonists will save us skybums a lot of 
grief said bob lafay 56 of suburban tujunga the forest launch 
pads are closed during fires

arab and western nations toughened their resolve against saddam 
hussein on tuesday condemning his threats against the hostages and 
adding more muscle to the force intended to strangle his economy 
and drive him out of kuwait 
in an address to president bush saddam defended detaining 
foreigners and promised a major catastrophe if fighting breaks 
out in the persian gulf iraqs defense minister tariq aziz 
called for a negotiated settlement but did not offer to withdraw 
iraqi troops from kuwait and restore its monarchy 
egypt which has led the arab opposition to the invasion urged 
saddam to withdraw from kuwait or face a war that will devour 
everything 
syria formally announced that it was sending troops to saudi 
arabia 
yemen promised to turn away an iraqi oil tanker but questions 
about its intentions surfaced when at least two iraqi oil tankers 
appeared in its port 
prime minister margaret thatcher refused to negotiate with iraq 
to win freedom for britains 4500 hostages and she urged the 
united nations to authorize the use military action to stop iraqi 
tankers in the persian gulf 
as president bush pointed out yesterday saddam hussein is 
trying in his tactics to hide behind western women and children and 
use them as human shields and use them as part of his 
negotiations she said at a news conference 
at the first alleuropean meeting on the crisis spain belgium 
the netherlands and italy said in paris they were sending warships 
to the region 
to bolster us forces depleted by the massive deployment of 
troops in saudi arabia bush planned to order thousands of military 
reservists into active duty administration officials said the 
executive order would probably be openended allowing the pentagon 
to call up reserves as needed 
in the persian gulf defense secretary dick cheney met with 
saudi officials to share military intelligence and discuss the 
possible sale of additional f15 fighters and heavy tanks to 
bolster the kingdoms defenses 
in the face of all this activity iraqs leaders again predicted 
that iraqs vast army would decimate the usled multinational 
force in a war 
the americans have prepared the ground for a war of 
aggression if the americans think this is a vacation like they had 
in panama and grenada this will be a bloody conflict and america 
will lose and be humiliated aziz said 
saddam defended his decision to round up thousands of 
westerners including 3000 americans and use them as a shield 
around military facilities 
in a speech on iraqi television the iraqi president said 
banning some foreigners from travel is not motivated by 
vengeance but rather a measure to prevent a crime of aggression 
which president bush intends to commit against the people of iraq 
after his crime of occupying the land of mecca and the shrine of 
the prophet mohammed if he commits this crime a major catastrophe 
will befall not only the region but also the world 
he denounced the united states for rejecting his offer sunday to 
free foreigners if the united states withdraws its forces from 
saudi arabia and guarantees that the economic embargo against iraq 
will be lifted 
aziz who spoke with reporters in jordan also said iraq was 
prepared to end the crisis through negotiations but neither he nor 
saddam offered to withdraw the iraqi troops that overran kuwait on 
aug 2 
iraq had accused kuwait of depriving it of vital oil revenue by 
stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides claim and 
by cheating on its opec production quotas and contributing to the 
world oil glut 
we are ready to talk aziz said my president made 
proposals that we are ready to put all the cards on the table at 
the un security council 
aziz said such a meeting should resolve all conflicts in the 
persian gulf including the palestinian uprising in israel 
although the minister said he had carried a message from saddam 
to jordans government he declined to discuss its contents 
jordan a us and iraqi ally has not fully committed itself to 
the international embargo and iraqi goods continue to pass through 
jordans port of aqaba on the red sea 
iraq meanwhile has moved sufracetosurface scud missiles into 
occupied kuwait increasing the threat of a chemical weapons 
attack brig gen turki bin nassar a saudi base commander told 
reporters in the kingdom on tuesday 
but he said that us and saudi forces have defenses against the 
scuds including us patriot antimissiles in place in saudi 
arabia 
in the persian gulf shipping radios crackled with conversation 
as us and british warships challenged almost every commercial 
vessel in the southern reaches of the waterway according to 
shipping executives in bahrain 
there were more than 25 us warships including three aircraft 
carriers in the region britain france the soviet union and west 
germany also have warships in the area belgium and australia have 
vessels on the way

asian organized crime groups are spreading 
into this country along with a brisk trade in heroin and soon could 
be double the size of the cosa nostra in its heyday a senate 
chairman said tuesday 
asian triads will be the dominant organized crime force in 
this country by the middle of this decade chairman joseph r 
biden ddel told a senate judiciary committee hearing 
he said triads highly secretive criminal societies born in 
china centuries ago could have 9000 members in the united states 
in 10 years that is double the justice department estimate of cosa 
nostra strength at its peak in the 1960s 
fbi officials confirmed the problem is growing 
its coming at us and its coming at us real quick and we 
better be ready said robert m bryant deputy assistant director 
in the fbis criminal investigative division 
biden and bryant both stressed that criminals represent only a 
tiny slivver of the asianamerican community most 
asianamericans are hardworking lawabiding patriotic 
citizens bryant said 
he also said the problem of asian organized crime is broader 
than the chinese triads but he said they were among the most 
dangerous groups 
he said the triads with an estimated 80000 to 100000 members 
in hong kong plus two large groups in taiwan in many ways resemble 
the organized crime groups that rose to power in america in the 
bootlegger era 
the two are similar in traits ranging from the use of secret 
signs and oaths to infiltration of legitimate businesses according 
to documents released by the committee 
bryant said the success of law enforcement in fighting heroin 
imported by traditional mobsters from the processing mills of 
marseilles has created a market opening for even purer shipments 
from southeast asia 
the heroin much of it coming from a rebel army based in the 
jungles of burma is shipped to singapore and taiwan and from there 
to seattle and vancouver bryant said he said most of it goes from 
there to new york for distribution throughout the country 
since 1985 southeast asian heroin as a percentage of all heroin 
seizures in the united states has increased from 14 percent to 43 
percent bryant said he said purity has increased from 3 percent 
to 5 percent in the early 1980s to 40 percent to 50 percent in 
major east coast cities now 
the bulk of the heroin enters the united states as seemingly 
legitimate cargo fbi officials said they said the traditional 
silence of the triads and the fear of retribution from them has 
made it hard to gather evidence but they added that some progress 
has been made 
in one notable case code named white mare a cooperative 
witness told agents of a new yorkbased heroin broker electronic 
surveillance turned up five other narcotics organizations one 
directly linked to the shan united army of general khnu sa based 
in the burmese jungle 
as a result fbi agents and new york police in february 1989 
seized 850 pounds of 90 percent pure heroin the largest domestic 
heroin seizure ever twentysix individuals were arrested in the 
united states and 18 overseas and 45 million in cash was seized

a former kgb general who has denounced the secret 
polices tactics outpolled 20 other candidates including a 
cosmonaut in the first round of elections to represent southern 
russia in parliament 
the former spy oleg d kalugin now faces a runoff election 
against an agricultural official nikolai gorovoi the soviet press 
agency tass reported tuesday 
if kalugin is elected to represent krasnodar province in the 
congress of peoples deputies he will gain parliamentary immunity 
allowing him to continue to criticize the kgb without fear of 
prosecution 
after kalugin publicly accused the secret police in june of 
resisting reform and continuing to carry out dirty tricks he was 
dismissed and stripped of his rank becoming an unlikely hero to 
soviet radicals 
the soviet prosecutor has been investigating him under a law 
that prohibits divulging state secrets but no formal charges have 
been filed 
the 55yearold former major general who was a kgb agent in the 
united states throughout the 1960s has hurt the kgbs recent 
effort to improve its image the secret police long associated 
with purges and repression reorganized itself this year 
officially eliminating the directorate responsible for harassment 
of dissidents it has undertaken a public relations campaign aimed 
at inspiring trust instead of fear 
kalugin has insisted that the kgb still infiltrates trade unions 
and the russian orthodox church taps the telephones of many 
citizens and engages in dirty tricks abroad 
tass said about 60 percent of the voters turned out for sundays 
election in krasnodar a heavily agricultural region along the 
black sea about 750 miles south of moscow the runoff election 
scheduled sept 2 is necessary because none of the 21 candidates 
won a clear majority of the votes 
interfax an independent soviet news service said kalugin 
received 959082 votes just under 45 percent of the total number 
cast gorovoi the next highest votegetter received 227572 
votes or nearly 11 percent he is deputy chairman of the regional 
agroindustrial committee and previously served as chairman of a 
collective farm 
among the other candidates were anatoly berezovoi a pilot and 
cosmonaut who took a 211day space flight in 1982 and gen 
vladimir sein political chief of the transcaucasian military 
district their vote totals were unavailable 
the kgb and its supporters attempted to discredit kalugin before 
the election and one resident said in a letter to the newspaper 
arguments and facts that it was rumored people who voted for 
kalugin would be imprisoned 
pravda the communist party newspaper said tuesday the election 
campaign was unusually sharp and tense sometimes going beyond 
the bounds of decency 
kalugin served as a kgb operative in the united states from 1958 
to 1970 first under the cover of a radio moscow correspondent and 
later as a first secretary in the soviet embassy in washington

government and black leaders 
tuesday made a joint plea for peace as the death toll from 10 days 
of tribal fighting topped 400 
president fw de klerk conferred separately with zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi and gen bantu holomisa head of the xhosa 
homeland of transkei to discuss fighting in black townships around 
johannesburg between zulus and xhosas 
not only must the bloodshed cease the war of words must 
cease the government and the black leaders said in a joint 
statement after the talks in pretoria this has often been 
interpreted at grassroots level as license for violence 
whether the talks will calm the townships remained in doubt 
holomisa leads a nominally independent homeland in the southeast 
part of the country far away from the fighting he is an ally of 
the african national congress the largest black opposition 
movement but he has no real influence outside his region 
buthelezis supporters have been fighting rivals in the eastern 
province of natal for five years 
the anc led by nelson mandela was not represented at tuesdays 
meetings 
the fighting since aug 12 has pitted zulus loyal to buthelezis 
conservative inkatha movement against xhosas most of them 
followers of the anc 
buthelezi said he had met privately with top anc leaders in 
recent weeks to discuss the violence but he would not identify 
them he reiterated his call for an immediate meeting with mandela 
buthelezi said mandela had almost been throttled by members of 
his own leadership for suggesting such a meeting 
holomisa meanwhile charged in a statement that south african 
police have been aiding inkatha fighters in the recent unrest 
police have repeatedly denied such accusations 
the zulus and xhosas have battled with guns machetes spears 
clubs and axes in the some of the worst township violence since 
nationwide unrest during the mid1980s 
police said the death toll had reached 405 by tuesday night 
there were several scattered clashes but no major fighting 
reported tuesday 
the johannesburgarea fighting has marked the spread of 
political violence from natal province where inkathaanc fighting 
has killed some 5000 blacks since 1986 
the anc has rejected a facetoface meeting with buthelezi since 
fighting began in johannesburg mandela canceled a meeting with 
buthelezi earlier this year reportedly because of pressure from 
anc leaders in natal 
the anc contends buthelezi is trying to broaden inkathas 
constituency beyond natal by instigating violence against anc 
supporters around johannesburg 
buthelezi and other inkatha leaders contend the anc is not 
willing to tolerate any rivals and seeks to monopolize political 
power 
both the anc and inkatha oppose apartheid the system of racial 
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and 
economic control over 30 million blacks but the two groups differ 
over tactics and plans for a future south africa

the militarybacked government 
removed the nations spy chief tuesday marking the latest in a 
string of dismissals of ousted prime minister benazir bhuttos 
associates 
shumsur rehman kallue a retired army general and head of the 
inter services intelligence was replaced by maj gen mahmood 
durrani a former aide to gen mohammad zia ulhaq zia who 
overthrew ms bhuttos father in 1977 and ruled pakistan for 11 
years died in a mysterious plane crash in august 1988 
in announcing kallues dismissal a defense ministry spokesman 
said he was an officer with a very good reputation there was no 
friction between him and the army 
the isi comparable to the us central intelligence agency 
served as washingtons conduit for arms shipments to the moslem 
guerrillas fighting to overthrow the sovietbacked government in 
neighboring afghanistan 
ms bhuttos 20monthold government was dismissed aug 6 on 
charges of corruption ineptitude and abuse of power it was 
replaced by a caretaker government seen by many as a thinly 
disguised form of military rule 
the new government composed of some of ms bhuttos former 
allies and fiercest opponents has removed several of her political 
appointees including a number of ambassadors 
kallues appointment as head of the isi last year created an 
uproar within the military and it was seen as a victory over 
pakistans army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg who had 
submitted his own candidate 
the isi is closely linked to the military and ms bhuttos 
appointment of kallue was seen as an attempt to distance the 
intelligence bureau from the military

following is the text of iraqi president 
saddam husseins message to president bush carried by the official 
iraqi news agency in arabic and translated by the associated press 
once again us president george bush stood before the 
american people to twist words hide facts or part of the facts 
and confuse causes with results 
in his speech yesterday 20th of august 1990 before american 
war veterans he referred to the americans in iraq and stressed on 
calling them hostages despite iraqi declarations that clarified 
beyond any doubt that the americans are here as result of a real 
aggression launched against the arab nation and iraq by president 
bush himself and his ally british prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
had this aggression not occurred had president bush 
considered realistically the interests of the american people then 
none of what happened to the americans and others would have 
happened nevertheless what happened to them remains the lightest 
all the formulas that such circumstances require even by the 
stands of america itself 
president bush know or should know that america itself and 
during world war ii had interned tens of thousands of its citizens 
simply because they were of japanese origin and based this action 
on the theory of deterring larger harm by lesser or smaller harm 
so if this precedent already exists and is recorded in the 
files of the united states of america along with other actions 
recorded in the files on humanity isnt it a form of racial 
discrimination when what is allowed for other nations including 
the americans is not allowed for the arabs including the iraqis 
despite all this the iraqis have stated clearly that what has 
happened was a force majeure dictated by the circumstances among 
many other options 
and we regret what happened 
preventing some foreigners from traveling is not an act of 
vengeance but a force majeure to deter a crime of aggression 
president bush intends to commit against the people of iraq after 
the crime he committed in occupying the shrine of kaaba mecca and 
the tomb of the prophet medina and should he proceed to commit 
this crime then a major catastrophe will befall not only this 
region but the entire world 
bush continues in his speech to talk about the outlaws 
comparing clearly between iraq and its representatives and hitler 
forgetting that all these descriptions apply to him because iraq 
did not send its fleets and aircraft to attack europe or america 
it is bush and those whom he dragged with him to the cliff who were 
the ones who embarked the aircraft and ships and invaded our 
region after desecrating our sanctities they want to kill the 
people and rob them of their human rights 
is there any doubt that these descriptions apply to presient 
bush when he is seeking to fuel a war that might burn the entire 
world is there a better proof of his intentions after he 
stonewalled all the initiatives and solutions which we had offered 
for settling the main problem or the issue of the foreigners which 
is a result of the main problem 
it is undoubtedly misbehavior a reflection of poor insight 
and wisdom for the white house to reject our initiative of the 
12th of august 1990 a few hours after it was aired before 
president bush took it upon himself to request official text to 
guard against inaccuracy in translation or deficiency in phrases 
for technical reasons 
is this possible president of the united states of america 
he who does not want history to link him to the basic 
characteristics of hitler must search thoroughly for peaceful 
means and not rush into preparations for war 
what we presented in our initiative of the 12th of august 
1990 and in our letter to the families of the foreigners whom the 
national council decided to host is a clear way for anyone to 
distance himself from the basic descriptions of hitler 
characteristics of love and peace that are desired by the 
peoples of the world 
at the same time we defend without fear from any arrogant 
and sinful tyrant or aggressor the principles of our religion and 
holy shrines and the honor of the homeland and nation even all the 
values of humanity combined 
the claim that the american forces have come here to defend 
saudi arabia does not stand in the face of the conflicting fact 
because the reality is that we have no intention of attacking saudi 
arabia or any other country 
however to say that your forces came here to defend american 
interests you know that the arabs including iraq are not opposed 
to legitimate interests whether they be the wests in general or 
the united states 
you also know that prosperity scientific and technical 
development and the promotion and flourishing of growth cannot be 
achieved in the way the arabs want it to without the wests 
cooperation 
to achieve this the arabs have to sell oil the major oil 
market is europe and the united states in addition to japan 
i assume that president bush knows that iraq for example 
sold a third of its oil to the united states until the 2nd of 
august 1990 and that iraq was against the feverish price increases 
that took place in 1973 we have documents to prove that 
at any rate the arabs including iraq wish to sell their oil 
for all the purposes we have already mentioned not to drink it or 
freeze it 
the fact that iraq owns about 20 percent of the worlds oil 
reserves does not annul the principles we have already referred to 
if whoever owns oil is boycotted by the world it would be all 
the more reason for the world to boycott america and the saudi 
arabian government 
after all is not food more vital to the human being than oil 
we answer by saying yes by all human standards it is more 
vital than oil the human being cannot survive without food 
if president bushs criteria for boycotts hostility war and 
siege are applicable to iraq merely because it will or that it 
already does own 20 percent of the worlds oil reserves then it 
is all the more reason that these standards in every sense be 
applied to those who own the same percentage or more of food 
primarily grain 
then what is required is that the world stand against america 
and australia 
but if us interests have become so small and narrow in 
bushs view that they are restricted to the relations between bush 
and saudi king fahd before bushs assumption of the presidency 
and followed his election and if their interests have become so 
narrow that they do not consider them as they should in terms of 
good and positive relations with a large and great nation but 
consider them only with jaber alahmed the croesus of kuwait and 
his band who is unable to construct a useful sentence and who 
along with people like him has been a source of shame to the arabs 
and proof to the west of their backwardness then you will be 
cursed by what you are doing 
before concluding my letter i would like to say that the 
source of potential and power mr bush does not lie in the size 
of armies and technological superiority nor in your alliance with 
those who betrayed their nation and people it lies in the 
inclination toward what is right 
however god is greater and more powerful than everyone and 
as we have previously said america would not have been a 
superpower if it had not been influential in the world 
in order to remain influential it must respect the freedom of 
peoples and the right of nations to make their own choices it also 
must respect other peoples sanctities and feeling 
if you continue to ignore this then i warn of the 
consequences and i hereby record for history that pursuing this 
policy will cause america to fall from its present status and it 
will lose many opportunities 
in all circumstances if your pursue war and blockade you 
will be defeated and with the help of god we will triumph 
god is great shame be on the shameless 
saddam hussein on the 30th of moharram 1411 corresponding to 
21st of auugust 1990

a government air traffic controller who lost 
his dulles airport job after he began taking an antiaids drug has 
accepted a lowerlevel faa position in miami the controller said 
tuesday 
ron wilkinson said he would continue to pursue an 
antidiscrimination complaint against the federal aviation 
administration and planned to file a federal court suit alleging 
discrimination based on a handicap 
faa spokesman roger meyers in miami confirmed that wilkinson 
29 had been offered a job in the faas miami control center but 
said he didnt know whether the job had been accepted 
the faa suspended wilkinsons medical certificate in july 1989 
when he told his superiors at dulles which serves the washington 
metropolitan area that he was taking the drug azt or zidovudine 
after testing positive for the presence of hiv virus 
the faa says that controllers who have the critical duty of 
monitoring and directing aircraft are to be given less critical 
jobs if they take azt wilkinson said he was only offered another 
job at dulles months later after being put on forced leave 
he had argued that the faa should offer him a job in miami where 
he was being treated by a doctor and had a group of people helping 
him deal with his exposure to aids wilkinson said he has none of 
the symptoms of aids itself and has been healthy since his medical 
certificate was lifted 
a person who tests positive for antibodies to the aids virus has 
a 20 percent to 30 percent chance of developing aids over a 
fiveyear period according to the federal centers for disease 
control 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys immune 
system rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and 
infections 
the faa has said azt may impair a controllers ability to keep 
track of aircraft 
wilkinson his lawyers and the controllers union have disputed 
that saying medical evidence shows no serious side effects from 
use of the drug 
wilkinson said he has accepted a job as an air traffic 
assistant with a salary 4000 lower than his earnings as a full 
controller in accepting he said he retained his right to pursue 
the antidiscrimination case the new job also will deny him an 
additional 4000 in overtime and differential pay he said 
the faa has yet to confirm his employment or set a starting date 
for the new job he said 
the agency gave him until aug 22 to accept or reject the offer 
he said 
wilkinson said he has nearly 11 years of federal service 
including eight years as an air force controller he said he would 
have qualified as a toplevel controller in about a year if his 
certificate had not been voided

the state board of pardon and paroles on tuesday 
commuted the death sentence of a repentant convict after receiving 
pleas for mercy from mother teresa jesse jackson and relatives of 
the murder victim 
william neal moores defenders call him a bornagain christian 
who has been a positive influence on other prisoners moore 39 
had been scheduled to die wednesday in georgias electric chair 
but won a stay of execution earlier tuesday from the us supreme 
court 
moore was a depressed 23yearold soldier from fort gordon when 
a friend told him about an old man who kept 20000 cash in his 
home according to evidence in the case moore got drunk and 
entered the home of 77yearold fredger stapleton when stapleton 
fired a gun at him moore said he panicked and shot back killing 
the man 
it was the third time the pardons and paroles board had granted 
clemency to a georgia deathrow inmate since capital punishment was 
reinstated in 1976 in both other cases a conspirator had been 
sentenced to die while the defendant who actually committed the 
killing received a life sentence 
chairman wayne snow jr said he believed the boards unanimous 
decision was based largely on the fact that moore who pleaded 
guilty did not have a jury trial the board members felt 
considerable information about moore might have come out in a 
trial of the case snow said 
he also noted that members of the victims family had asked the 
board to spare moores life thats not something we often see 
snow said 
the parole board heard monday from mother teresa the nobel 
peace prize winner who called from calcutta india and urged the 
panel to do what jesus would do said staff member marsha 
bailey who took the call jackson the former democratic 
presidential candidate wired the board on saturday to urge 
clemency 
snow said moore under georgia law will not be eligible for 
parole consideration until he has served 25 years in prison 
meaning moore will have to wait nine more years 
moore has written stapletons family members a lot of times 
from prison that hes sorry and that he hopes the family can 
forgive him said loretta jordan farmer stapletons greatniece 
and i can

white house chief of staff john sununu on 
tuesday shrugged off the idea that president bush was hurting his 
image by vacationing during the mideast standoff with iraq 
sununu joined the president on a golf outing here to raise funds

bush has gone boating daily and made several trips to the golf 
course since coming to maine aug 10 for a 25day vacation he has 
flown back to the white house twice met at his oceanfront home 
with jordans king hussein and spent hours on the telephone dealing 
with the crisis 
i think everybody knows he keeps in touch with whats 
happening sununu said id rather have a president that kept 
the whole thing in perspective than one who locked himself behind 
closed doors and brooded about the whole problem 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking separately with 
reporters said the presidents in command wherever he is thats 
all that matters

the white house on tuesday rebuffed 
an offer from iraq to negotiate saying the world is united in 
demanding the unconditional withdrawal of saddan husseins army 
from kuwait 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said western nations are 
willing to talk to iraqi officials about the welfare of their 
citizens held in iraq and kuwait 
but thats not the same as negotiations over a un demand to 
get out said the press secretary he declined to respond to what 
he called the latest litany of criticism of bush from saddam 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz said in amman jordan 
tuesday that we are ready to talk and put all the cards on 
the table at a un security council meeting aziz and saddam in 
separate statements warned that the united states would be 
defeated and humiliated if it went to war against iraq 
fitzwater said iraqi officials have refused to give a us 
diplomat in baghdad access to americans and he added at this 
point we see very little to talk about when all we get are negative 
responses 
the white house also announced that defense secretary dick 
cheney returning from a trip through the tense middle east and 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will 
fly to maine wednesday to confer with bush at his oceanfront 
vacation home among the matters they will discuss are a planned 
callup of military reserves 
fitzwater said bush will not sign before wednesday the order 
calling up reserves to fill in the ranks of doctors cargo handlers 
and other specialists depleted by the massive deployment of us 
troops to defend saudi arabia 
the number of reservists to be called was still unspecified one 
administration official said privately the order may be openended 
chief of staff john sununu said it will be a very surgical 
specialized callup 
fitzwater said 18 americans got out of kuwait tuesday but 
there are still 54 americans missing 13 in kuwait and 41 in 
iraq 
it does appear that citizens of all nations are being moved 
about in iraq to unknown destinations he said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
there were credible reports that iraq had forced some 
westerners to industrial installations and said an american in 
kuwait was seized in his home and interned in a hotel 
boucher said the reports had not been confirmed nor was it 
known whether americans were among those taken to plants 
saddam has threatened to use westerners as a human shield to 
dissuade the united states from attack more than 3000 americans 
are among more than 10000 foreigners trapped in iraq and kuwait 
the buildup of us forces continued in saudi arabia 
at the pentagon gen hansford t johnson the top official 
responsible for getting troops and supplies to saudi arabia said 
security rules prevented him from disclosing the exact number of 
ground troops there or on the way but that weve moved in 
essence the equivalent of a town the size of jefferson city mo 
preliminary 1990 census figures put jefferson citys population 
at 35408 
an additional 20000 or so sailors are deployed on warships in 
the area 
fitzwater spoke with reporters at the woodlands country club in 
falmouth maine while bush was out golfing at a tournament raising 
200000 for maine gov john mckernans reelection drive 
fitzwater stressed that it was not the united states alone but 
all nations that were demanding iraq to end its occupation of 
kuwait 
we demand complete and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
that is the position of the united nations and thats the position 
of all nations the spokesman said 
im sure all nations are interested in the welfare of their 
citizens interested in talking to iraq at any point thats not 
the same as negotiations over a un demand to get out he said 
fitzwater said joseph wilson the us charge daffaires in 
baghdad met with iraqi officials monday demanding access to 
americans his plea was spurned 
asked if there could be no talks with iraq until its tanks are 
out of kuwait fitzwater replied the important point here is 
that the world is united in demanding that iraq withdraw from 
kuwait that has not changed one iota by these comments this 
morning 
bush back from a day of speeches in which he termed the 
foreigners in iraq and kuwait hostages and attacked saddam as a 
man of evil standing against human life itself ignored reporters 
tuesday saying nothing to them during on an early morning jog and 
on the golf course 
bush spoke by telephone tuesday to thomas pickering the us 
ambassador to the united nations and to national security adviser 
brent scowcroft who was back at the white house 
fitzwater said us warships were still shadowing several ships 
in the persian gulf region to make sure none violated the trade 
embargo with iraq however he said one iraqi tanker was being 
allowed to dock in a yemen port based on assurances from the yemeni 
government that that country would not unload or use iraqi oil 
sununu also out golfing in mckernans tournament defended 
bushs decision to stay in maine in spite of the crisis 
everybody knows he keeps in touch with whats happening 
said sununu id rather have a president who kept the whole thing 
in perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and 
brooded about the problem 
the president later attended a memorial service for his uncle 
dr john walker 81 a retired surgeon and investment banker from 
easton md who died thursday

when the two germanys finally unite 
they will be a mighty nation of 78 million people stretching from 
france to poland 
the two germanys were founded in 1949 their division resulted 
from adolf hitlers defeat in 1945 east germany was run by 
stalinist leaders for four decades while west germany immediately 
adopted a parliamentary democracy system of government 
west germans built a prosperous nation from the ashes of world 
war ii west germany has one of the worlds most powerful economies 
and is known for its excellence in hightechnology its currency 
the deutsche mark is king in europe 
over the past two years west germany has also established itself 
as an important player in world politics 
east germany was long considered one of the most prosperous 
nations in eastern europe but last falls revolution revealed a 
nation that had been weakened by years of communist mismanagement 
and corruption 
east germany has major industries including chemical 
production but many of its industries are on the verge of 
collapse overburdened by antiquated production practices 
crumbling factories and skyrocketing debts 
financial experts say the germans will expand their economic 
might after unification 
but many problems will have to be overcome such as soaring 
unemployment in what is now east germany 
some experts predict that within 10 years east germans will 
enjoy the same kind of prosperity as their western neighbors 
when the two nations unite their total area will be roughly the 
size of montana

drug control cooperation between the united 
states and mexico is expected to improve in the coming year but the 
next few months will be critical in dealing with new governments of 
colombia and peru the state department said tuesday 
in a midyear update of its annual international narcotics 
control strategy report the departments bureau of international 
narcotics matters said it is encouraged by developments in the 
fight against cocaine but the heroin situation gives less reason 
for optimism 
with new governments of two of the andean nations colombia 
and peru the coming months will be critical if the hemispheric 
commitment to narcotics is to be sustained and tangible progress 
made in dismantling trafficking networks and reducing the cocaine 
supply the department said 
it said the outgoing government of peru declined to sign an 
agreement for 35 million in us military aid to assist in 
counternarcotics efforts but new president alberto fujimori has 
indicated a commitment to continuing the counternarcotics effort 
as well as a willingness to conclude agreements on military 
assistance 
it said the colombian government has continued to extradite 
major drug traffickers and money launderers to the united states 
an action which colombian traffickers fear most 
given recent decreases in reported cocaine usage in the united 
states and reported reductions in emergency room incidents 
involving cocaine these developments in the andes provide reasons 
for encouragement the report said 
the us and mexico continued to cooperate closely on cocaine 
interdiction and we expect that cooperation between the us 
and mexico will continue to improve during the coming year the 
department said 
however the department said the international heroin 
situation is not as encouraging as that of cocaine overproduction 
of opium has kept prices down in the us and europe and the supply 
of heroin is abundant worldwide

a marine who filed for conscientious objector 
status last week has been told to prepare for deployment as part of 
a us policy he says is unnecessarily interventionist 
marine cpl jeff paterson stationed at kaneohe marine corps air 
station has been told he wont be transferred to a nondeployable 
unit attorney eric seitz said monday but the attorney planned to 
file a lawsuit tuesday in us district court to ensure his client 
would not be sent to saudi arabia 
paterson 22 of hollister calif said he belongs to la casa 
a group that objects to us interventionist policies he said 
he does not want to be a pawn in americas fight for middle east 
oil and profits 
paterson who has seven months remaining in his military 
commitment has been working as a supply clerk he formerly worked 
in the field artillery 
military policy prohibits officials from confirming that a 
soldier or his or her unit are being deployed capt leonard ryan 
a spokesman for the marine base said filing for conscientious 
object status did not necessarily exempt him from deployment 
ryan said however that if military officials confirm paterson 
is a conscientious objector every effort will be made to transfer 
him to a nondeployable unit 
the determination will be made after a series of interviews 
ryan said he did not know how long it would take to make a 
decision 
ryan said paterson was being charged with unauthorized leave 
because he was not on leave when he gave an offbase news 
conference last week to announce his plans to resist deployment

the soviet union 
the pact along with secret protocols placed the three into 
moscows sphere of influence it also cleared the way for germany

after decades of denials soviet officials finally admitted in 
august 1989 that a secret deal with adolf hilter had deeded control 
of the baltics to the kremlin 
baltic activists have long maintained that the secret agreement 
and the republics annexation by the soviet union were illegal 
activists plan bonfire demonstrations in all three republics

talks or an agreement by soviet officials to deal with the latvians 
as equals the official news agency tass reported the claims by the 
latvian officials but also did not confirm any commitment by the 
soviet side 
latvia also promised to protect nonlatvians on its territory 
mainly russians but also said claimed threats against them had 
been exaggerated 
lithuania named an eightmember team to negotiate independence 
from the soviet union lithuania declared its independence on march 
11 but has agreed to suspend the measure for 100 days once talks 
begin 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis made a radio appeal

the persian gulf crisis is more than 
headlines to those with ties to the worlds largest naval base it 
means once again saying goodbye to husbands and wives sons and 
daughters neighbors and friends 
these are not just news stories these are our neighbors 
said jack hornbeck president of the local chamber of commerce i 
live in virginia beach next door and across the street are naval 
aviators a surface warfare officer lives just down the block 
when they deploy the neighborhood kind of pulls together to 
help out the families we want these people to know we support 
them 
deployments are nothing new to the norfolk area home to a 
variety of military posts inluding the largest naval base norfolk 
naval station in the past two weeks 34000 have left in ships and 
planes as part of the deployment of us troops to saudi arabia and 
the persian gulf 
thirtyfive ships carrying 28000 sailors left from the norfolk 
naval station and nearby little creek amphibious base since the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait fortyeight f15s have flown from langley 
air force base across the james river from norfolk 
but more than 100000 sailors and nearly 100 ships remain at the 
norfolk naval station 
the deployments came on short notice after iraqi tanks rolled 
into kuwait on aug 2 the aircraft carrier john f kennedy had 
five days notice that left little time for anything other than 
preparations 
the major challenge for these families was getting ready to 
leave capt tom johnson atlantic fleet chaplain said tuesday 
now they are seeing the empty piers and the reality of the 
separation is setting in 
cmdr george keller director of the norfolk navy family 
services center said the number of calls for assistance has 
increased 
the unknown is the most significant thing this was on such 
short notice and that has raised the level of stress deployments 
are something the navy lives with he said 
area leaders say the influence of the military on the area goes 
beyond the mere numbers the military brings more than 54 billion 
to the local economy every year more than a quarter of the areas 
13 million people have a direct link to the military 
its hard to find anybody in any walk of life in this area 
that didnt start in the navy said donald smith a sociologist 
at old dominion university 
the navy is very much a part of us part of our community 
there is no us or them norfolk mayor joe leafe said 
cathy stokoe executive director of the navy family services 
center and a navy wife for 26 years said the communitys feelings 
toward the troops and their families makes life a little easier 
when the threat of war is near 
if there is something going on you couldnt ask for a better 
place to be she said

more than two dozen groups filed a lawsuit 
tuesday challenging a nuclear regulatory commission decision to 
ease controls on the disposal of lowlevel nuclear wastes 
the lawsuit filed in the us court of appeals here said the 
new policy means unhealthy levels of radiation could be left in the 
soil and buildings at closed nuclear power plants and that 
radioactive contamination could drift into the ground water at 
garbage dumps 
the lawsuit also alleges that nrc didnt provide for adequate 
public participation before issuing the new policy in june 
the nrcs rule trades off peoples lives in favor of the 
financial interests of the nuclear industry said joan claybrook 
president of public citizen one of the environmental groups that 
filed the lawsuit 
the nrc said it would on a casebycase basis deregulate the 
disposal of certain lowlevel atomic wastes from nuclear power 
plants hospitals laboratories and other facilities if the 
radioactive emissions are considered below regulatory concern 
under the new policy such wastes could be disposed of in 
conventional landfills all radioactive wastes under previous nrc 
policy automatically must be given special precautions and taken to 
designated disposal sites 
the nrc has argued that many of the lowlevel wastes now 
requiring special treatment emit such a low dosage of radiation 
that they dont pose a health concern 
in addition to public citizen other groups joining the lawsuit 
were the us public interest research group the natural resources 
defense council the nuclear information and resource service and 
physicians for social responsibility

mayor manuel camacho solis said at mondays ceremonies in 
current times the most profound significance of this house is in 
communicating that what happened here should never again happen 
again harassing and taking the life of someone who thinks 
differently 
what trotsky predicted the end of the system that persecuted 
him is today being achieved said another speaker political 
historian adolfo sanchez vazquez 
trotsky died on aug 22 1940 26 hours after soviet dictator 
josef stalin had his political rival murderously assaulted at 
trotskys homeinexile in the fashionable mexico city neighborhood 
of coyoacan 
the assassin who struck trotsky in the skull with a 
mountaineers ice ax after trotsky returned from a seafood 
restaurant spent 20 years in prison his identity was a mystery 
but he was thought to be a spaniard ramon del rio mercader also 
known as jacques mornard and frank jackson 
the house formerly maintained on meager funds donated by 
trotskys grandson esteban volkow and members of the trotskyist 
revolutionary workers party was given a meticulous facelift 
the city spent more than 230000 to refurbish it and build the 
adjacent asylum rights and public freedom institute 
the institute affirms mexicos policy of providing political 
asylum to exiles regardless of ideology officials said at the 
ceremony 
it is a transformation of history into an instrument of 
rights institute board member javier wimer told about 200 people 
trotsky and his wife natalia sedova arrived in mexico in 
january 1937 after stalin ordered trotskys exile and execution 
the two leaders of the 1917 bolshevik revolution were locked in a 
power struggle as the health of vladimir lenin founder of the 
soviet state waned 
camacho said trotskys exile in mexico was an example of this 
countrys overall international and internal policy everyone 
was against trotsky and the president of the republic received him 
in mexico 
mexico has given asylum to the late shah of iran refugees from 
the spanish civil war and chilean exiles 
edgar sanchez spokesman of the revolutionary workers party 
attended the ceremony with more than a dozen party members waving 
red and white party flags 
its very positive what is happening here now he said in an 
interview 
he lauded the governments policy on political asylum but added 
that camachos presence doesnt change the fact that there are 
other rights that are not respected by the government of the 
institutional revolutionary party 
he was referring to the governing party that has dominated 
mexican politics since 1929 often through fraud and intimidation 
members of two other trotskyist groups gave the soviet unions 
mexican ambassador a petition with 500 signatures demanding changes 
in the way trotskys role is taught in the soviet union 
trotsky traditionally has been vilified in soviet textbooks as a 
traitor to the communist party 
the institutes book collection includes 5000 volumes by and 
about trotsky and other exiles museum coordinator jose enrique 
ortiz said 
harvard university donated a catalog of the complete works of 
trotsky contained in its library 
the institutes exposition hall opened with works by exiled 
chileans and spaniards in mexico two wallsized paintings 
depicting trotskys assassination dominate the exhibit 
volkow who found trotsky bleeding to death in his study 
attended the ceremony 
museum specialists restored the house and gardens where 
trotskys ashes are buried using documents and photos to return it 
to its condition at the time of trotskys death ortiz said 
the garden reflects trotskys passion for collecting the hardy 
desert plants that his wife spent much of her time tending he 
added 
trotskys eyeglasses broken in the attack are perched on his 
writing desk along with documents about world war i and stalin 
subjects trotsky was writing about when he was killed 
bloodstains from the fatal attack are still in the house so are 
bullet holes in bedroom walls from an earlier assassination attempt

an attack by leftist guerrillas in el salvador 
on an army barracks across the street from the presidential 
residence raises doubts about the rebels willingness to negotiate 
the state department said tuesday 
the guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and 
negotiate seriously to end the war said the departments deputy 
spokesman richard boucher 
military sources in san salvador the salvadoran capital said 
one person was killed and five were wounded in monday nights 
battle 
army troops backed by helicopter gunships exchanged automatic 
rifle fire with the rebels for about 30 minutes the attackers 
withdrew shortly after nightfall 
the guerrilla attack came as peace talks in neighboring costa 
rica stalled monday over rebel demands that the army be abolished 
and officers be punished for politically motivated murders 
these actions raise serious questions about fmln guerrilla 
willingness to reach a negotiated end to the war boucher said 
rather the guerrillas appear to be trying to cause a break in 
the talks and renewed violence the guerrillas continue to threaten 
a second offensive 
more than 73000 people the majority of them civilians have 
been killed since the war began in october 1979

even though the first test of a new federal 
law against drunken flying brought conviction of three airline 
pilots the prosecutor and others are renewing calls to beef up the 
law or test pilots for alcohol 
what we need is to provide the traveling public with 
aggressive steps to ensure that transportation professionals are 
sober and unimpaired steve hilton spokesman for sen john 
danforth rmo said tuesday danforth is cosponsoring a bill to 
require random alcohol testing in safetyrelated transportation 
jobs 
barry sweedler director of the office of safety recommendations 
for the national transportation safety board said he favors a 
zero tolerance level for alcohol in pilots 
theres no place for any alcohol in the cockpit of an airplane 
or the bridge of a ship or the cab of a truck or the engine of a 
train sweedler said 
former northwest airlines pilots norman lyle prouse robert 
kirchner and joseph balzer admitted drinking the night before their 
march 8 flight from fargo nd to minneapolisst paul they 
argued that they werent impaired during the flight despite 
bloodalcohol readings of 013 percent 006 percent and 008 
percent respectively two hours after landing 
a jury deliberated three days before finding the three guilty of 
flying under the influence monday in the first test of a 1986 
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on 
commercial transportation 
to reach a guilty verdict jurors had to decide the pilots 
performance actually was impaired by drinking thats because the 
law doesnt define drunkenness as a certain percentage of alcohol 
in the blood as do many state drunkendriving laws 
assistant us attorney elizabeth de la vega said congress 
should consider making the law tougher by specifying that it is a 
felony to fly with bloodalcohol concentrations of 004 percent or 
more 
for some pilots their former colleagues arrests was all it 
took for them to rethink their habits 
i stopped drinking period northwest airlines capt jerry 
wortman said tuesday i think it made me realize that in this job 
or in any job theres no point to it any more 
wortman a northwest pilot for the past 23 years said he was 
averaging only one drink a week when the arrests prompted him to 
quit 
the case has prompted a handful of commercial pilots to submit 
to an industrywide alcohol rehabilitation program said john 
mazor a spokesman for the air line pilots association in 
washington since the program began in the mid1970s about 1200 
pilots have signed up mazor said 
hilton said its important to focus on random alcohol testing 
legislation to improve detection 
rep james oberstar dminn who heads the aviation 
subcommittee of the house public works and transportation 
committee said there is opposition to random alcohol testing on 
civil liberties grounds 
besides oberstar said aviation experts consider the heavy 
drinking by the three former northwest airlines pilots an 
aberration 
were not talking about an epidemic thats for sure 
oberstar said 
according to the ntsb there have been only 16 airline accidents 
since 1983 in which drug or alcohol use by pilots was found to be a 
factor none of involved a crash of a major airline 
the faa office in oklahoma city said it has recorded 126 pilot 
revocations and 111 suspensions for drug and alcohol violations in 
the past five years only 36 of the pilots worked for commercial 
passengercarrying airlines and 12 of those had their licenses 
revoked including prouse kirchner and balzer the faa said 
joann sloane an faa spokeswoman in washington said the trial 
has heightened awareness of the problem but hasnt prompted changes 
in faa policy 
major us airlines arent planning changes in their alcohol 
policies said kathleen henriques spokeswoman for the air 
transport association 
they are continually talking about drinking and flying she 
said there hasnt been anything spurred by this incident

the bush administration is making contingency 
plans to cut back the us embassy staff in kuwait but will not 
shut its doors despite iraqi demands us officials said tuesday 
obviously we need to maintain an essential presence to take 
care of american citizens one official told the associated press 
there are about 120 us diplomats in the iraqioccupied persian 
gulf country their main concern has been keeping track of the 
2500 or so americans trapped in the country since the invasion 
three weeks ago 
one of the problems facing administration decisionmakers is 
whether the american diplomats will be able to leave easily or 
safely 
there is no final decision on whether or how many us 
diplomats may be withdrawn said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
iraqi president saddam hussein has demanded the closing of 
embassies in kuwait city in retaliation for the worldwide economic 
boycott approved by the un security council 
saddam on monday warned diplomats in kuwait to shut their 
embassies by friday and to transfer their missions to baghdad 
otherwise a foreign ministry spokesman said they will be 
treated as ordinary foreign nationals 
the nine west european nations meeting tuesday in paris 
rejected the ultimatum and asserted their intention to remain open 
the decision was announced by gianni de michelis the italian 
foreign minister 
the us embassy headed by ambassador nathaniel howell 
maintains contact with as many americans in kuwait as it can reach 
by telephone or in person they are advised of developments and 
keep the embassy informed of their own situations 
more than 500 americans have left kuwait during the crisis 
despite the embassys advice that they not risk defying iraqi 
travel restrictions 
last week when iraq demanded americans and britons in kuwait 
gather at hotels the embassy conveyed the order but gave no 
specific advice a handful of americans showed up at the hotel 
found no iraqi authorities there and left the next day 
britain and the soviet union already have decided to scale down 
their diplomatic presence in kuwait without ceasing operations 
this might provide a pattern for the united states to follow as it 
weighs its own decision 
earlier tuesday the state department said there were credible 
reports that iraq has forced some westerners to go to oil 
refineries and other industrial installations and that an american 
was seized from his home in kuwait and detained in a hotel 
spokesman richard boucher said the reports had not been 
confirmed nor was it known whether americans were among those 
taken to the plants 
the reports came from a variety of sources including diplomats 
in iraq another us official said 
the westerners were seen around oil refineries but no one got 
close enough to pinpoint whether they included americans said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
saddam has threatened to use westerners as a human shield in the 
event of a us military attack more than 3000 americans are 
among more than 10000 foreigners trapped in iraq and kuwait 
president bush has described the americans as hostages and said 
he would hold iraq responsible for their safety iraq has allowed 
only us diplomats to depart although eight private us citizens 
managed monday to reach saudi arabia boucher said 
the 18 us diplomats who left iraq drove across the border to 
jordan leaving about 10 members of the us embassy staff behind 
sufficient to operate the spokesman said 
the american seized at his home in kuwait monday night was not 
identified boucher said iraqi soldiers had forced a man probably 
a kuwaiti at gunpoint to identify the homes of westerners the 
american was taken to the meridien hotel where he was reported to 
be in good condition 
officials are uncertain about the whereabouts of two other 
groups of americans thirtyfive have not been seen by us 
officials since they were taken from the rashid hotel in baghdad 
last friday 
the state department presumes they are in another hotel the 
melia mansour where british citizens have been interned but 
american diplomats have been prevented from checking despite daily 
requests to the iraqi foreign ministry 
twelve americans were seized sunday night from two hotels in 
kuwait city 
in all 54 americans are in iraqi custody included are six 
americans who are being held in the melia mansour hotel in baghdad 
the holding of innocent people against their will for 
political gain is wrong and it cannot be condoned boucher said 
iraq is violating the most basic norms of international behavior 
by its stated policy of using innocent civilians as a form of 
insurance against against international efforts to impose 
unmandated sanctions 
the united states will continue to press iraq by all means 
available to fulfill its obligations for the safety and welfare of 
foreign citizens in kuwait and iraq by allowing them to leave the 
united states will not negotiate concessions in return for what is 
an international obligation on the part of iraq

iraqi authorities told western ambassadors that 
citizens of seven european community nations will be allowed to 
leave kuwait an official of the foreign ministrys persian gulf 
crisis unit said early wednesday 
the offical listed the countries as italy belgium spain 
denmark the netherlands ireland and greece he said the citizens 
would be allowed to leave kuwait by way of jordan and turkey 
about 120 italians are in kuwait nothing was said about 
foreigners in iraq and figures for other nationalities were not 
given 
the official spoke to the associated press on the condition of 
anonymity after rai italian state television reported that word 
was conveyed to the italian ambassador in kuwait 
he said the ambassador also was told about dutch citizens 
because italy represents dutch interests in kuwait 
state tv reported that premier giulio andreotti who is 
vacationing in northern italy received the news in an urgent 
telephone call from president francesco cossiga late tuesday 
there is wonderful news andreotti said according to an rai 
reporter who saw the premier take the call at an art exhibit the 
italians in kuwait will be able to leave 
andreotti told a reporter he hoped the news is the first sign of 
an easeup by iraq 
it was not immediately clear when any of these foreigners would 
actually leave the country 
they were trapped when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
president saddam hussein of iraq has said he would prevent more 
than 11000 westerners from leaving iraq and kuwait until the 
united states withdraws from the persian gulf and lifts the 
maritime quarantine of his country 
many of the foreigners already have been reported deployed at 
strategic military and industrial points in iraq to deter assault

iraqi forces in kuwait must steal 
water food and fuel to survive british intelligence sources said 
tuesday they also said the iraqi threat of chemical warfare is not 
as great as first feared 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
120000 iraqi soldiers now occupying kuwait are in far worse shape 
than the west first believed even president saddam husseins 
elite republican guard 
their logistics system is a shambles soldiers are reduced 
to stealing water and siphoning gasoline from civilian cars and 
many troops are young and shaky the sources said 
american intelligence now paints a picture of an iraqi army 
whose discipline is breaking down and whose equipment is becoming 
increasingly unserviceable in the rigorous desert climate the 
sources said 
there is a danger of giving too much credit to saddams 
capabilities said air vice marshal sandy wilson commander of 
british forces in saudi arabia 
he said he is confident the allied forces now in saudi arabia 
can repel an iraqi air attack 
the window of vulnerability which existed in the days 
immediately following the invasion of kuwait has passed we now 
have a very good air defense system in place and i am sure we can 
fulfill our commitments wilson said 
the intelligence sources said iraq would probably have a 
fairly small chance of mounting either a successful chemical or 
conventional attack on allied forces 
asked if the iraqis would seize the chance of attack before the 
arrival of us tanks by sea in two weeks time the sources said it 
was highly unlikely 
if they did we would chew them up from the air and could 
relatively easily shut off their already stretched supply lines 
one source said 
the intelligence sources said the threat of chemical bombardment 
by longrange sovietmade scud missiles had been largely nullified 
by deployment of saudi patriot antimissile missiles 
iraq possessed a very limited amount of deadly nerve gases such 
as sarin and tabun the sources said 
they said iraq has large quantities of mustard and phosgene gas 
but the effects of these would be severely degraded in the 
115to 130degree heat in the potential battle area 
at dhahran the main saudi air base parking space has become a 
critical problem with more than 240 fighter aircraft from three 
nations and scores of transport and helicopter gunships on the 
tarmac a steady stream of us military and chartered civilian 
aircraft drone in around the clock as the steady buildup 
continues on average an aircraft lands every 10 minutes 
on tuesday us c141 starlifter transport planes were landing 
at dhahran roughly every quarter of an hour some were forced to 
sit idling on the taxiway for up to half an hour awaiting a 
takeoff which would vacate a parking bay 
one us pilot stepping off a starlifter after a sevenhour 
flight from madrid said this was his fourth visit to dhahran in 
four days 
the saudi pilots at dhahran flying britishmade tornado fighters 
only received the aircraft weeks ago 
according to lt col yahya zahrani 39 commander of the royal 
saudi air forces 29th squadron we are now operationally fully 
ready and i believe in the longterm saddam will be shown that 
his invasion was a mistake 
he said his unit and the british air force tornadoes were now 
coordinating their efforts and were in all but name a joint 
force 
morale is high and the 1000strong british force gleefully 
point out that while they are sleeping in airconditioned huts 
most of the 60000 american troops here are bedding down in tents 
on the main airfield us air personnel have taken to sleeping 
at night beneath their fighter aircraft and helicopter gunships in 
an attempt to escape the heat 
the resolve among the british pilots was best summed up by 
flight lt steve pittaway a tornado navigator with 5 squadron 
i believe what churchill said britain is indeed a sleeping 
lion and given a cause and a sense of purpose such as that which 
we have over the invasion of kuwait our resolve is absolute he 
said

the moslem worlds venerated center of 
theology alazhar and egypts highest cleric on tuesday condemned 
iraqs invasion of kuwait the two also indirectly urged the 
execution of iraqi president saddam hussein 
alazhars sheik gad elhaq aly gadelhaq and egypts mufti 
mohammed sayed tantawi justified the presence of foreign forces 
to defend saudi arabia which many moslem groups oppose 
the statements by egypts mufti mohammed sayed tantawi and 
alazhar the ancient universitymosque and seat of islamic 
learning were published in early editions of wednesdays state 
dailies 
hours earlier president hosni mubarak appealed to saddam in a 
nationally broadcast message to withdraw his forces from kuwait and 
avoid a destructive war in the name of islam the religion 
of peace and in the name of arab nationalism 
the moslem clerics statement was run on alakhbar dailys 
frontpage under the headline the leader of iraq is treacherous 
and moslems have a duty to kill him 
however the text of the comments referred to a tyrant in 
general not specifically saddam 
accusing the iraqi troops of committing crimes in kuwait 
alazhars gad elhaq quoted a verse from the koran that said if 
the iraqi leaders continue to the end of the destructive road the 
arab and islamic world must react and save themselves from this 
tyranny and its armies must encircle the tyrant 
tantawi too referred to verses from the koran which moslems 
believe are the direct words of god to the prophet mohammed 
calling for the execution of a tyrant if he does not redeem 
the moslems and their leaders should first try and solve a 
dispute if one party is tyrannical to the other and does not 
accept reconciliation the moslems and their leaders must decide to 
kill the tyrant without any hesitation said tantawi in 
explaining the verses 
however he added if the tyrannical party changes and 
resorts to peace the moslem leaders must reconcile the two 
parties 
islamic leaders have shown varied reactions to iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait at an arab league summit earlier this month 12 
of the states agreed to impose sanctions on baghdad and to help 
defend saudi arabia against a possible iraqi threat 
islams holiest shrines mecca and medina lie in saudi arabia 
islamic activists in algeria and jordan among others have 
supported iraqs acts and condemned the deployment of american and 
western vessels and troops in the gulf region 
but both clerics justified the presence of nonarab nonmoslem 
forces

thousands of foreigners continued to pour 
across the border by land and air from iraq on tuesday including 
two excongressmen who arrived on a flight from baghdad 
george hansen of idaho and thomas kindness of ohio spent five 
days in iraq with an interpreter on a factfinding mission under 
the auspices of hansens free america foundation both were 
republican representatives in their states 
twenty arabamericans with dual nationality were among the 8419 
foreigners who arrived by land and air from iraq on tuesday said a 
jordanian immigration official who could not be named under 
standing regulations 
hansen and kindness who arrived with a planeload of foreigners 
on an iraqi airways flight said they would spend the night in 
amman before catching a flight wednesday for new york 
also on the flight were cbs anchorman dan rather and a network 
crew of eight that was ordered out of baghdad hansen said 
five australian diplomatic staffers also were on the arriving 
flight said airport sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
in a telephone interview kindness said he and hansen were 
carrying back appeals to president bush from iraqs moslem and 
christian leaders to give consideration to the sanctity of the 
arab peninsula where so many holy treasures are located 
hansen said he and kindness were examining us policy in the 
middle east but provided few details beyond that he said they 
went out and tested the water everywhere we could and we did it 
substantially alone and i guess i cant say that it was 
uncomfortable being there 
the two tried to find out about americans who had been stranded 
in baghdad after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but had only 
mixed success hansen told the associated press 
some of them apparently had made their way home hansen 
said others were still in iraq but had joined apparently some 
of the others that were also detained there and had been farmed out 
as quote guests end quote in the smaller villages around some of 
the defense installations and that type of thing 
hansen was a gop congressman for seven terms he lost election 
in 1984 after being convicted of filing false financial disclosure 
statements to congress 
in december 1979 hansen was criticized by the state department 
for visiting iran twice on an unauthorized oneman mission to 
discuss american hostages held in the us embassy in tehran 
kindness represented western ohio for 12 years until 1986 when 
he made an unsuccessful bid to oust sen john glenn he became a 
lobbyist in washington but ran for reelection to congress losing 
in the republican primary in may 
kindness said their trip arranged by the iraqi embassy in 
washington stemmed from conversations with some arabamerican 
friends who were concerned about the growing tension in the 
persian gulf 
he said he left baghdad with a better understanding of the iraqi 
point of view 
iraq does not want to fight the united states hansen said 
i think they understand the problem of doing such a thing 
they dont want to make a firststrike effort 
meanwhile as other foreigners mainly arab and asian nationals 
continued to flood into jordan overland from iraq 346 soviets and 
five frenchmen caught flights for home shortly after their arrival 
while the crisis sparked by iraqs aug 2 seizure of kuwait 
deepened the us embassy in amman called on the estimated 3000 
american citizens in jordan to register with it the state 
department monday called for the departure of all us citizens 
without essential business 
soviet and french nationals reached the ruweishid border post 
204 miles northeast of amman late monday according to their 
respective embassies officials said all had departed by air for 
home tuesday 
the soviets had been working in kuwaiti oilfields and were the 
third soviet group to leave since the invasion according to a 
soviet embassy spokesman 
a french embassy spokeswoman said the five french citizens 
included the wife of a french diplomat in baghdad two other adults 
and two children 
iraqi president saddam hussein has allowed soviets to leave 
freely the soviet union was saddams chief arms supplier before 
moscow agreed to cut off weapons shipments after the kuwait 
invasion 
france was also a major weapons supplier but the iraqis have 
interned french citizens along with other westerners 
a total of 560 french were in iraq and kuwait at the time of the 
invasion officials in baghdad said tuesday they would not be 
allowed to leave if france joins the us in enforcing a un 
embargo against iraq 
jordanian border officials said egyptians made up most of the 
hundreds of foreigners continuing to arrive from iraq 
about 20000 egyptians who had crossed into jordan earlier were 
gathered at jordans red sea port of aqaba waiting for ferries to 
take them home

radio stations in texas and california 
joseph isgro is charged under a 1960 federal law that makes such 
payola bribes punishable by one year in prison and a 10000 
fine 
but authorities hope also to convict him of far more serious 
crimes 
a 57count indictment handed up in november accuses isgro 43

case a jury will buy 
one of those witnesses is isgros bodyguard david michael

sen terry sanford dnc called 
tuesday for a gradual reduction in us forces in the middle east 
saying the show of force has accomplished its goal of stifling 
iraqi aggression 
we have accomplished our mission of stopping iraqs drive to 
take over saudi arabia and the rest of the middle east sanford 
said in a news release we should begin to reduce our forces in 
saudi arabia ever so slowly and look to a more multinational 
force to keep the peace 
the call by sanford who has a liberal voting record was the 
most outspoken criticism of the us buildup so far from capitol 
hill 
sanford said the united states must put the lives of its 
soldiers and the interests of americans stranded in the middle east 
ahead of worries about iraqs invasion of kuwait and its oil 
reserves 
iraq did not violate us rights particularly and it is not 
up to us to rectify their wrongdoing he said except that we 
are part of the united nations we have no interest in kuwait worth 
the life of a single serviceman certainly i would not risk a 
single life to restore the kuwaiti royal family to the throne 
sanford said president bush and his advisers may have exposed 
americans in the middle east to greater danger when they 
exhibited all that bluster about forcing iraq to retreat from 
kuwait 
seizing foreign nationals is about the only defense saddam 
hussein iraqs leader has to discourage invasion which the us 
buildup gives him reason to fear sanford said 
the matter is best left to the united nations and continued 
multinational efforts to embargo iraqi trade he said 
even the embargo should be tempered to avoid hampering food 
shipments sanford said 
this is not in keeping with the humane practices of civilized 
societies he said cutting off the income iraq would receive 
from the sale of oil will be quite adequate to resolve the matter

a government report showing a sharp rise in 
the number of food stamp recipients reveals a lot more poor people 
in the united states than many wish to admit the chairman of a 
congressional committee on hunger said tuesday 
it shows you to a certain extent the sleeping giant that is 
out there said rep tony hall dohio in a statement released 
by his office following published reports about an agriculture 
department study on food stamps 
he said the findings in the report demonstrate how even a slight 
downturn in the economy can be too much for some people throwing 
them onto public assistance rolls 
the report a summary of which was furnished by the agriculture 
department on tuesday said the number of people using food stamps 
rose by more than 1 million between the second quarter of fiscal 
1989 and the second quarter of this fiscal year pushing the 
overall figure to just over 20 million 
the rise extended to 44 states and the district of columbia 
varying in size and timing from state to state nearly half the 
total increase was attributable to a rise in recipients in texas 
california and florida the report said 
agriculture department investigators found no consensus about 
the causes of the increases they said the increases are so recent 
that much of the data traditionally used to analyze food stamp 
trends are not available 
however the study offers several possible reasons for the 
increases including greater unemployment more working poor 
higher food prices changes in the distribution of income more 
female heads of household changes in the immigration laws giving 
thousands of aliens legal status and making them eligible for food 
stamps and improved accessibility and outreach 
food stamps are an entitlement said halls statement it 
doesnt make any sense to create an entitlement program and then 
keep it a secret at some time everyone is going to have to come to 
grips with the fact that we have this many poor people 
further studies will be done to improve the food stamp program 
said a committee staff member also hearings on poverty in america 
will be held soon by the house select committee on hunger which 
hall chairs 
the house earlier this month approved a farm bill that would 
expand access to the food assistance program the house approved 
181 billion for fiscal 1991 the senate has yet to act 
the agriculture department study was undertaken at the request 
of the senate appropriations committee which was concerned about 
the recent rise in recipients 
the bush administration anticipating 181 million food stamp 
recipients this year requested 133 billion for fiscal 1990 
congress approved 148 billion and later provided another 12 
billion when the initial amount proved to be too low

equipment on board six ships tuesday as they prepared to set sail 
for liberia to halt the bloody civil war there their orders were 
to stand by in the port of beleaguered monrovia and avoid fighting 
during truce negotiations 
hours after the troops were scheduled to leave their ships 
remained in the harbor of freetown some soldiers were seen 
sleeping on the pavement while others were attending a disco in the 
port authority area 
hundreds of soldiers from gambia ghana nigeria and sierra 
leone were expected to leave for liberia on wednesday 
late tuesday they were still loading armored cars tanks and 
other military equipment on board their vessels 
the ships began loading after liberian rebel leader charles 
taylor refused to go to a meeting on tuesday to discuss a 
ceasefire with gambian president sir dawda jawara 
taylor had agreed on monday to attend the meeting instead he 
sent three envoys to meet with jawara chairman of the economic 
community of west african states task force commander lt gen 
arnold quainoo of ghana and west african foreign ministers 
guinean soldiers were traveling overland across their border 
with liberia to join the task force according to a west african 
community statement issued in the gambian capital banjul 
this would take the guineans through hostile territory held by 
rebels led by taylor he has threatened to attack any foreign 
troops that intervene in the 8monthold conflict in the west 
african nation of about 25 million people 
african leaders previously told their soldiers they must fight 
if necessary to force a ceasefire in the threesided conflict 
the rebels are out to oust the government of president samuel 
doe which they branded as corrupt but a rebel faction led by 
prince johnson broke with taylor rebels now are fighting each 
other as well as does forces 
the banjul statement said the task force has orders to remain on 
standby in the liberian capitals port and avoid all operations 
while mediation efforts to bring about a truce go on 
west african leaders decided aug 6 to intervene in the war 
they said it was no longer an internal conflict because thousands 
of their nationals were trapped in monrovia and because of the 
burden on neighboring states of about 400000 liberian refugees 
from the fighting 
guinea already has hundreds of troops stationed on its border 
after taylors rebels invaded to kill liberian refugees of the 
mandingo tribe mandingos are accused of supporting government 
soldiers 
on monday does soldiers and the rival rebel faction under 
johnson which controls most of monrovia announced a truce 
johnson has pledged to hold monrovias port for the arrival of 
the african force which doe also has welcomed 
fighters from both doe and johnson forces told a diplomat in 
monrovia on monday they were ready to join forces to resist any 
attack by taylors men 
taylors forces number about 10000 the largest army in 
liberia but are mainly illtrained peasant recruits and boys

clifftop presidential mansion 
the rebels invaded liberia on dec 24 invasion from ivory coast 
in february the rebels split into rival factions under taylor and 
johnson

prime minister margaret thatcher pledged on 
tuesday never to negotiate for the release of hostages held by 
iraq as government sources confirmed that some britons have been 
moved to military sites 
she denounced president saddam hussein of iraq for using 
innocent britons and other westerners as human shields saying 
this practice totally flouted fundamental human rights 
she emphasized british rejection of the iraqi order that all 
embassies in kuwait be closed by friday and said the british 
embassy will remain open 
solidarity is important here we are fully entitled to keep 
our embassy there our people are there and they have a right 
to expect the full amount of protection that we can possibly give 
them she said 
mrs thatcher promised that the hostagetaking would not deter 
britain from helping to liberate kuwait and defend persian gulf 
states from further iraqi aggression action she announced the 
government was considering sending additional forces and aircraft 
to the region 
hours later senior government sources disclosed for the first 
time that some of the 137 britons rounded up in kuwait by the 
iraqis had been taken to military sites 
there are some who are in civilian installations but we have 
found out today tuesday that there are others at military 
installations said one government source speaking on condition 
he was not identified 
the foreign office said tuesday night the iraqi military took 10 
britons and one american from homes in kuwait city to a civilian 
establishment in the city where they were safe and well 
it was the first report of britons being rounded up from homes 
the foreign office said it couldnt confirm a us state department 
report that they were taken at gunpoint 
it said the whereabouts were known of 97 of the 137 britons 
rounded up in kuwait 
the highlevel government sources said 76 were at civilian 
installations but refused to say if the other 21 were held at 
military sites they did not disclose the location of the military 
sites 
for the first time mrs thatcher referred to the britons being 
held by iraq as hostages 
as president bush pointed out saddam hussein is trying 
in his tactics to hide behind western women and children and use 
them as human shields and use them as part of his negotiations 
she told a news conference 
we will never bargain 
she accused the international committee of the red cross of 
failing to take action to protect foreign nationals in kuwait and 
iraq she said it was contacted aug 8 and 10 but she was deeply 
disappointed it did nothing 
foreign office minister william waldegrave met cornelio 
sommaruga swiss president of the icrc in geneva tuesday and asked 
the organization to try to help britons and other foreigners in 
kuwait and iraq the foreign office said 
it said waldegrave stressed it was clear iraq breached the 4th 
geneva convention which protects civilians 
waldegrave said sommaruga shared british government anger and 
frustration and that the icrc was doing its best to gain access 
to the hostages 
an icrc spokesman said the meeting was one of a series of 
contacts the icrc had held with several countries since iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
mrs thatcher asked other nations to contribute military forces 
or funds to show solidarity with the international effort to deter 
iraq and enforce the un embargo against it 
she said she and president bush had said from the beginning we 
do not rule out military force but the key was making the 
economic sanctions effective to bring pressure on iraq 
she said she supported a further un resolution following the 
sanctions on iraq voted by the united nations security council 
adding 
that resolution must have teeth if its to be effective

the producer of the hit london musical miss 
saigon said tuesday he would take a 600000 loss rather than 
bring the show to broadway amid controversy over his casting of a 
white man to play a eurasian pimp 
but cameron mackintosh left the door open for a rapprochement 
that could bring the show and its 25 million in advance ticket 
sales to broadway in april 1991 the show initially was supposed 
to begin previews a month earlier 
i cannot in good conscience reschedule the production in the 
absence of a positive working environment and an understanding 
that artistic freedom of choice cannot be compromised mackintosh 
said in a threepage statement released in new york 
mackintosh however said he was willing to work out differences 
with actors equity and that he had sent the union a letter 
outlining the problems he felt must be overcome for a us 
production the 600000 loss is expenses the producer already 
incurred preparing to bring the show here 
equitys approval of jonathan pryce to play the role of the 
eurasian was insufficient evidence that the union had a change of 
heart he said 
their decision was made solely on the technical basis of mr 
pryces acknowledged star status as i have repeatedly stated it 
is also essential that the profoundly unpleasant atmosphere 
currently surrounding the production be dispelled mackintosh 
said

have no comment until wednesday equity executive secretary alan 
eisenberg was in a meeting tuesday afternoon and unavailable to 
comment

after actors equity which has veto power over a foreign actors 
appearance in the united states voted against letting pryce bring 
his awardwinning role to broadway

for his portrayal of the brothel owner in the play the new york

was determined to be a star during the second equity meeting 
eisenberg said stars from other countries usually receive

minority actors the pryce role is the only one in the cast that 
has been announced the musical is a love story about an american 
soldier in vietnam during the final days of the war in 1975

western european nations agreed tuesday to increase 
pressure on iraq with a coordinated military response and urged the 
security council to give persian gulf forces more power to help 
enforce un sanctions on iraq 
the decision by foreign and defense ministers of the ninemember 
western european union or weu signaled a unified tougher 
european posture toward iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it was followed by a european community decision to refuse iraqi 
orders to close embassies in kuwait and a veiled threat that iraqi 
embassies in europe could also be shut 
the weu plan was a green light for belgium the netherlands and 
italy to send ships already heading through the mediterranean to 
the crisis area along with several other nations they were 
awaiting a decision by the ministers before committing naval forces 
to the region 
french defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said spain and 
greece also announced they would send ships 
all warships will remain under their national commands 
coordination will extend to zones of operation task sharing 
logistical support and exchanges of information according to a 
final communique 
our exceptional meeting responds itself to a situation which 
is exceptional in its gravity and its implications foreign 
minister roland dumas of france said a small country surely but 
a sovereign independent country would find itself wiped off the 
map if international reaction had not been so vigorous and 
unanimous 
europe has until now reacted with varied responses timid in 
comparison with the united states 
britain and france both with special interests in the arab 
world are currently the only weu members with forces now in the 
gulf region 
the european fleets are composed mainly of minesweepers 
corvettes frigates and destroyers france sent an aircraft carrier 
and guided missile cruiser in an eightship fleet totaling 3800 
sailors 
west germany said it would move to change its constitution to 
allow the use of military forces outside the european theater 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd announced 
but officials added this was likely a long process and not 
possible before joint german elections this year 
only portugal expressed reserves about joining in the 
multinational military effort dumas said 
weu secretarygeneral willem van eekelen said members agreed in 
principle to the use of force to respect the un embargo on iraq 
the ministers asked the un security council to take needed 
supplementary measures for the embargo to be effectively in place 
a us draft resolution now before the council calls for 
international military action to back up the embargo 
the weu warned of serious consequences should harm come to 
foreign nationals trapped in iraq and kuwait 
the weu was created in 1954 and is the only wholly european 
forum for security and defense its members france britain west 
germany italy belgium the netherlands spain portugal and 
luxembourg all belong to the 12nation european community 
the weu meeting was the first major european gathering to 
address the iraqi invasion it was followed by a working lunch of 
ec foreign ministers to discuss the plight of trapped westerners 
and other issues 
italian foreign minister gianni de michelis said the ec decided 
to defy an order by iraqi president saddam hussein to close 
embassies by friday in order to ensure the protection of our 
nationals 
he said diplomats were instructed not to forcefully resist 
closing of the missions 
de michelis said after the ec meeting that any attempt to harm 
westerners would be considered the most serious kind of offensive 
act against the community 
italy is current ec president 
president francois mitterrand of france which called for the 
two meetings said trapped westerners were being held hostage 
a term the ec declined to use 
it was the first time france referred to its 560 nationals in 
iraq and kuwait as hostages

the highest awarenesslevel commercials in the fast food 
industry said john merritt vice president for public relations at 
hardees food systems the new owner of roy rogers 
but marriott business and food services management which owned 
roy rogers at the time also provides food to school systems 
airlines universities and other customers 
the institutional food workers of america came unglued and

caesars palace attorneys say they will present 
evidence that comedian rodney dangerfield has severe problems 
with cocaine marijuana and alcohol abuse when his lawsuit 
against the resort goes to trial 
an attorney for dangerfield called the allegations a joke 
the civil trial is scheduled to begin monday in us district 
court here 
dangerfield and his paperclip productions inc of new york are 
seeking 225000 in damages from caesars the resort has filed a 
breach of contract countersuit against its former headliner for 
100000 plus punitive damages 
dangerfield sued the resort because of a march 16 1988 incident 
in which he said he suffered eye damage after being scalded by a 
burst of steam when entering a steam room behind the hotels 
showroom 
in documents filed with the court monday the resorts attorney 
jill r cohen wrote that the steam didnt cause dangerfields eye 
problems the brief blames dangerfields lifestyle and his use of 
a certain type of eyedrops despite warnings to the contrary 
the document said one witness will testify that at a party after 
the alleged incident dangerfield 64 was so intoxicated from 
drugs and alcohol that he literally passed out face first in a 
plate of food 
there will be substantial evidence that mr dangerfield has 
severe problems with cocaine marijuana and alcohol abuse that he 
swills vodka by the tumblerful smokes marijuana from morning to 
night and is a regular user of cocaine the trial document stated 
medical opinion testimony will demonstrate that such abuses 
significantly contribute to mr dangerfields eye conditions the 
document said 
dangerfields attorney barry langberg disputed the allegations 
rodney has denied them and i have never seen him use drugs 
landberg said tuesday weve heard the allegations of drug use 
and malingering before and they are totally contrary to rodneys 
performance record 
mr dangerfield has an excellent history of keeping his 
engagements the only recent performances he has missed have been 
the ones at caesars because their negligence caused his eye 
injuries and at ballys in las vegas because he wouldnt cross 
the picket lines during the musicians strike 
dangerfield filed the lawsuit in 1988 claiming his eyes were 
injured so severely that he had to cancel five performances at 
caesars dangerfield who is paid 45000 per show according to 
court documents was paid 135000 for performing three times 
during the weeklong run 
the trial brief contends dangerfield isnt entitled to be paid 
for performances he says he missed because of the injury the 
ceasars brief alleged he gambled at a competing hotel one night 
when he missed a performance on another night the document says 
he attended a boxing match at caesars sitting in a front row seat 
in public view while the resort had to announce he could not 
perform because of an injury

former hostage frank reed said tuesday the 3000 
americans held in iraq and kuwait are in for a long siege but he 
does not think they will suffer the deprivation of the 14 western 
hostages in lebanon 
im sure theyre nervous and tense reed said of their 
families back home but if we look at this logically to me there 
can be no benefit to saddam hussein to harm them somehow i think 
theyre in for a long siege and theyre going to sit in the desert 
for a long time 
reed a critic of the bush administrations refusal to negotiate 
with captors of the hostages in lebanon said he supports the 
presidents efforts against iraq 
as a protector of oil he is most likely doing the right 
thing reed said 
he expressed renewed concern for the six americans and other 
westerners held in lebanon he implored they not be forgotten in 
the gulf crisis 
for gods sake were talking about almost six years that terry 
anderson and tom sutherland have been in captivity he said in an 
interview they should be freed when i left them they were sick 
this is very degenerating this experience 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held hostage with nearly 5 years in 
captivity sutherland 59 acting dean of agriculture at the 
american university of beirut has been held for a little over five 
years 
the other american hostages are joseph cicippio 59 acting 
comptroller at the american university in beirut edward tracy 59 
west beirut resident alann steen 51 a communications instructor 
at beirut university college and jesse turner 42 professor of 
mathematics and computer science at beirut university college 
reed who is jobless and lives in an apartment in suburban 
malden was the director of the lebanese international school when 
he was kidnapped on sept 9 1986 
he said the showdown between the united states and iraq and the 
bush administrations preoccupation with the 3000 american 
hostages in the gulf further shoved the lebanon hostages into the 
background from the beginning theyve been lost he said 
i think theyve just been again put on the back burner he 
said i wish there was as much concern for them i saw some 
pictures on television this morning of the new hostages lying 
around swimming pools for me thats not hostaging hostages to me 
is deprivation cruelty dehumanization of people 
hell they arent chained they arent blindfolded they can 
walk around there wouldnt be any comparison as far as their 
treatment they can see their captives they know whos got them 
we never could see anybody 
state department spokesman richard boucher said he would have no 
comment on reeds remarks 
reed 57 was released last april 30 after 44 months in 
captivity in lebanon he said he was chained blindfolded badly 
beaten malnourished and poisoned with arsenic he tried to escape 
twice 
beaten about the face i had my jaw sticking out an inch below 
my face he said i couldnt eat for a month i had my feet 
broken if i do any prolonged standing or walking theyre very 
sore my nose was broken the ribs were kicked off the base 
protruding out like you would stick your two fingers through a 
tshirt 
the only similarity between the two hostage groups at the 
moment he said is that those americans held in iraq and kuwait 
have a prospect of endless time as terry and tom and the others 
are suffering from other than that i think theyre really pows 
held by a nation rather than by shadowy terrorists

leftist rebels stepped up attacks on 
government troops throughout el salvador on tuesday as hopes waned 
for a ceasefire accord in the latest round of talks aimed at 
ending the 10yearold civil war 
guerrillas staged a series of attacks on army positions south 
and east of the capital san salvador authorities said 
the attacks came after rebels used bombs hurled from homemade 
catapaults and mortars to attack an army barracks in san salvador 
across the street from president alfredo cristianis residence 
eleven people were killed and 12 were wounded in the fighting on 
monday and tuesday according to official and civilian sources 
as the fighting intensified government and rebel negotiators 
became less optimistic that any ceasefire accord would result from 
the current round of peace talks being held in san jose the costa 
rican capital 
it could be said that we are stuck and i dont believe we 
will reach substantial accords by the end of this meeting said 
the chief government negotiator salvadoran justice minister oscar 
santamaria before going into tuesdays negotiating session 
a rebel negotiator dagoberto gutierrez said if there is no 
government movement toward our proposal we would say that there 
wont be any spectacular accords 
both sides had expressed optimism an agreement might be reached 
when the current round of talks began friday between 
representatives of cristianis conservative usbacked government 
and the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front the 
talks are scheduled to conclude wednesday 
the talks are the fourth round of negotiations this year aimed 
at reaching agreement on a ceasefire by sept 15 
but un mediator alvaro de soto said it was unlikely there 
would be a ceasefire agreement by then 
given the dynamics of the negotiation process its impossible 
to arrive at a negotiated ceasefire agreement before sept 15 
de soto said 
but that doesnt mean that the negotiations wont continue 
he said 
the negotiators have made little progress toward reaching a 
compromise on rebel demands for reducing the size of the military 
and purging and punishing officers responsible for human rights 
abuses 
government officials have said discussions on the size of the 
army and a purge of officers should come only after a ceasefire 
neither side has agreed to suspend military actions during the 
negotiations 
a guerrilla spokesman said the attack on the barracks near 
cristianis residence was meant to pressure the government into 
softening its position in the talks 
this is how were going to crack the killer governments lack 
of will to negotiate said a guerrilla who read a communique 
monday on the local san salvador radio sonora 
in washington the state department said tuesday that the attack 
on the army barracks raises doubts about the rebels willingness to 
negotiate 
the guerrillas should immediately cease these attacks and 
negotiate seriously to end the war said the departments deputy 
spokesman richard boucher 
one civilian was killed and five others wounded in monday 
nights battle near the barracks military sources said but the 
rebels said no one was killed and only four civilians were wounded 
the rebels expressed regrets that civilians were wounded in the 
attack calling it a serious error in operational procedures 
we have given instructions that measures should be taken so 
that these types of incidents should not happen again the rebels 
said in a news release issued in mexico city 
army troops backed by helicopter gunships exchanged automatic 
rifle fire for about 30 minutes with the rebels before the 
attackers withdrew 
the military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
none of the rebel rounds hit the barracks which houses a military 
communications unit 
an official at cristianis residence said the president was not 
there at the time of the attack and denied radio reports that a 
mortar round hit the building 
on tuesday guerrillas attacked army positions in jucuapan san 
agustin and santa elena in usulutan province in eastern el 
salvador military officials reported 
the heaviest fighting was in jucuapan 68 miles southeast of san 
salvador where six rebels one national guardsman and one 
civilian were killed officials said three guardsmen and one 
civilian were wounded there were no reports of casualties 
elsewhere in the province 
more than 73000 people the majority of them civilians have 
been killed since the civil war began in october 1979

a rare operation has left a man with two 
functioning human hearts and a clean bill of health the university 
of wisconsin hospital announced tuesday 
surgeons inserted a human donor heart in william rammer 53 of 
kaukauna during an eighthour operation july 21 to supplement his 
diseased heart said dr barry fields the hospitals chief heart 
transplant surgeon 
rammer will be able to return to his hobbies and possibly even 
work fields said 
rammer who was discharged saturday from the hospital to an 
outpatient center and expects to return home next week attended 
the news conference tuesday 
i can feel the difference in the heartbeat it seems like i 
have a stronger heartbeat rammer told reporters theres a 
twin heart beat and you can feel them overlap once in a while 
rammer a former vice president at a farm equipment 
manufacturer said he was initially a little bit apprehensive 
when doctors discussed the procedure earlier this summer but it 
was either live with my old heart or try this he said 
rammer said he could barely breath or eat and had to severely 
limit his movements in the months before the operation but now he 
plans to resume golfing and bowling 
in ordinary transplants doctors remove a patients failing 
heart and replace it with a donor heart 
but in rammers case doctors opted for a heterotopic or 
piggyback transplant in which both a new heart and the ailing 
heart function in the patients chest fields said 
its a tight fit because were not removing anything the 
doctor said theyre sort of kissing back to back 
fields said the rare transplant performed only 17 times in the 
world in the last year is used only when patients over 45 suffer 
from high blood pressure in the lungs 
such patients cannot withstand a necessary heart and lung 
transplant so doctors then choose to insert a healthy donor heart 
to supplement the diseased heart fields said 
if the patients original heart stops functioning it is not 
removed and the patient can still function properly with the donor 
heart fields said 
fields said the procedure was developed in the 1970s but had a 
bad success rate primarily because the body would reject the donor 
heart now antirejection drugs have made all types of transplants 
more successful he said 
the us survival rate for the operation is now about 70 percent 
after one year and 61 percent after three years the hospital said 
rammer suffered from cardiomyopathy a disease that destroys the 
heart muscle as well as hypertension in his lungs after the 
operation his own heart pumped blood to his lungs while the new 
heart pumped blood to the rest of the body doctors said 
since then the new heart has become stronger and also supplies 
blood to the lungs which is a positive sign fields said 
fields said rammers original heart will continue to deteriorate 
because of the disease but at a much slower rate

only about 30 members of a rightwing 
paramilitary group linked to the nowdisbanded contra rebels 
surrendered their weapons on tuesday to an international commission 
a commander of the underground group speaking on condition of 
anonymity said most members planned to keep their weapons because 
they expected a sandinistaled leftist revolt 
the organization of american states set up the international 
commission for support and verification to help resettle 
demobilized contras and their families and it normally is not 
involved in collecting weapons 
we are making an exception because of an express request from 
the government and from the interior ministry said the 
commissions sergio caramagna 
a representative of cardinal miguel obando y bravo the 
archbishop of managua oversaw the arms surrender the weapons 
included hand grenades explosives and rifles 
contra leaders turned in their weapons on june 27 and the 
guerrilla force that fought the sandinistas was officially 
disbanded more than 18000 contra rebels were demobilized 
but the urban commandos of the internal resistance a citybased 
paramilitary group of contras continues to operate underground 
thousands of sandinista supporters are also believed to have 
weapons distributed by the sandinistas just before they handed over 
power in april to the usbacked government of president violeta 
barrios de chamorro her 14party coalition defeated the 
sandinistas in february elections 
the urban commandos surfaced last month during a sandinistaled 
strike calling themselves the brigades of national salvation they 
appeared on the streets after armed sandinista supporters began 
erecting barricades 
six people were killed in violence accompanying the strike and 
nicaragua appeared on the verge of a new civil war 
the commando commander said the urban commandos had an estimated 
350 members in managua but not many wanted to surrender their 
weapons 
we went around town last night asking others if they also 
wanted to disarm but they told us they felt safer with their 
weapons he this is a purely voluntary thing 
he admitted that the brigades and the urban commandos were one 
and the same but the brigades have a more civicsounding name 
the commander was unhappy with mrs chamorro for allowing gen 
humberto ortega a sandinista and brother of former president 
daniel ortega to remain as army chief 
you have to face the fact that its still a sandinista army 
and a sandinista police and were not going to let them take 
things over he said

making nuclear weapons the federal prosecutors office said

two iraqi tankers were docked at aden on 
tuesday but it was not immediately clear whether that signaled an 
aboutface from yemens pledge to adhere to antiiraq sanctions 
the official yemeni news agency quoted an unidentified foreign 
ministry official as saying tuesday that yemen does not intend to 
intercept or obstruct international navigation in the red sea the 
bab almandab straits the gulf of aden or arabian sea 
a port official reached by telephone said the iraqi tankers 
alfao and alqadissiyah were docked when he arrived tuesday 
morning 
the two tankers had been anchored in the red sea off saudi 
arabia which turned them away last week 
another iraqi tanker that defied a us warship challenge was 
reported steaming tuesday toward aden 
yemen told the un security council it would turn away that 
tanker one of two that refused to stop saturday when us warships 
enforcing the un embargo fired warning shots across their bows 
the ministry spokesman said reports that yemeni patrol boats 
will try to deter iraqi tankers from putting into port were 
incorrect 
he said yemen considers that would violate the un charter 
yemen could still adhere to un sanctions by ignoring the 
tankers and refusing them permission to load saudi arabia used a 
similar ploy to turn the tankers away from its ports 
diplomatic sources said the two tankers riding at anchor may 
have arrived before yemen announced its intentions at the united 
nations on monday night 
yemen has been gripped by proiraqi and antius demonstrations 
that included rockthrowing assaults on the us embassy early in 
persian gulf crisis 
an armed forces alert was heightened in yemen strategically 
located at the southern entrance to the red sea after the united 
states began the buildup of the multinational force in neighboring 
saudi arabia 
yemen has generally avoided criticism of iraq since the crisis 
began with iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 and opposed the 
dispatch of the multinational force to saudi arabia 
however gen ali abdullah saleh president since may in the 
merged state formed of north and south yemen went to washington 
early this year to foster ties with the united states

us sen alan simpson coasted toward an 
easy victory in the republican primary election tuesday while two 
women battled for their partys gubernatorial nomination 
with returns counted from 13 of the states 471 precincts mary 
mead had 771 votes or 74 percent to nyla murphys 272 or 26 
percent 
the victor will challenge incumbent gov mike sullivan who 
faced only token opposition in the democratic primary 
sullivan received 484 votes in the early returns while his 
opponent ron suds clingman a motorcycle repairman received 
just 66 votes 
simpson the senate minority whip was easily winning his third 
republican nomination with 87 percent of the early vote but it 
wasnt immediately clear who his democratic opponent would be 
simpson faced two political unknowns in the gop primary while 
six unheralded democrats sought their partys nomination for the 
seat 
the hunt for the gop gubernatorial nomination pitted mead 55 
the daughter of former gov and us sen cliff hansen against 
murphy a 59yearold casper woman who has served the past 12 years 
in the state house of representatives 
meads campaign stressed her skills as a rancher and 
businesswoman and attacked sullivans economic development efforts 
murphy in turn accused mead of having a negative attitude 
toward wyoming and of failing to propose solutions to the 
shortfalls she perceived 
sullivan largely ignored the primary campaign and stuck close to 
his gubernatorial duties 
us rep craig thomas was uncontested in the primary elected 
last year to fill dick cheneys unexpired term in office thomas is 
seeking his first fullterm in the house this fall also unopposed 
was his democratic challenger pete maxfield a university of 
wyoming law professor

in a dramatic toughening of the french stance in 
the persian gulf president francois mitterrand said tuesday that 
frances warships could open fire on other ships in the region 
mitterrand also said at a news conference at the elysee palace 
that the world had entered a war mindset toward iraq that will 
be difficult to shed 
an embargo without enforcement would be a mockery he said 
should the case arise the orders to our navy are to board 
vessels as for firing on a ship only the president of the 
republic can order it 
mitterrands implication that france could engage hostile ships 
in battle went beyond comments by a senior naval officer who said 
earlier tuesday that french warships in the gulf could fire warning 
shots on shipping to enforce the embargo against iraq 
but that hasnt happened yet rear adm pierre bonnot said 
in an interview with the french radio station antenne2 
last week french officials shied away from saying the french 
navy would take part in interdicting cargo ships entering or 
leaving iraqi waters 
but mitterrand said tuesday that iraqi president saddam 
husseins use of foreigners as human shields at strategic locations 
to prevent possible attacks on them had strengthened the worlds 
resolve 
without a doubt we are at this time in the wake of the 
responsibility taken by the iraqi president in a war mindset 
mitterrand said it is a mindset from which it will be difficult 
to emerge 
saddam has refused to allow thousands of westerners including 
about 560 french nationals to leave iraq and kuwait at least 27 
frenchmen have been forcibly transferred to unknown locations 
mitterrand also joined a growing chorus worldwide by calling 
french citizens being held in iraq hostages and acknowledged 
that efforts to negotiate their freedom had failed 
it was the first time the french leader had referred to the 
french being held in iraq and kuwait as hostages 
when you are told that they may be freed in exchange for a 
political or military benefit they are hostages mitterrand 
said there is no need to hide behind semantics 
the french national assembly will convene in an extraordinary 
session aug 27 to discuss the crisis mitterrand said

a federal judge tuesday ordered 
mississippi to pay more than 6 million to settle a 1970 lawsuit 
accusing the state employment agency of systematic racial and sex 
discrimination 
the settlement was the first of its kind in the united states 
said richard t seymour of the washington dcbased lawyers 
committee for civil rights under law which represented the 
plaintiffs 
im glad this has come to a closure and hope that employment 
services across the country will take this to heart seymour said 
us district judge lt senter jr ordered the state to pay 
47 million to about 760 former black and female clients of the 
employment services cleveland office the state also must pay 14 
million in attorneys fees 
this was no surprise said fred lotterhos general counsel 
for the state employment security commission he said there had 
been negotiations for the settlement for some time 
we stress the fact this happened a long long time ago what 
the court found we were doing wrong we are not doing that way 
anymore lotterhos said 
the lawsuit originally was filed in 1970 by rosie lee pegues and 
three other blacks the complaint later was amended to cover more 
than 1500 black or female plaintiffs who applied for assistance 
from the agencys cleveland office 
a federal appeals court ruled in 1983 that the cleveland office 
was guilty of referring blacks to lowpaying domestic and service 
jobs while reserving more desirable openings for whites it also 
found that the office discriminated against women by accepting 
orders for maleonly openings 
the court ruling covered blacks who sought jobs through the 
cleveland office in 1970 and women who applied for jobs between 
1969 and 1973 
the settlement amount was determined by comparing the salaries 
the plaintiffs made and the salaries of jobs they might have had if 
they had been referred by the cleveland office lotterhos said

the jury that convicted three former pilots 
of flying a jetliner while under the influence of alcohol reasoned 
they were drunk because they didnt have the sense to heed a 
federal inspectors warning not to fly 
if they werent concerned about the passengers lives they 
should have at least been thinking about their own careers said 
jury forewoman ruth boylan 
the jury deliberated three days before finding the former 
northwest airlines pilots guilty monday in the first test of a 1986 
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on 
commercial transportation 
the pilots flew a boeing 727 with 91 passengers from fargo 
nd to minneapolis after federal aviation administration 
inspector verle addison tipped off to their heavy drinking the 
night before met them at the fargo departure gate and warned them 
not to fly

disclosing the exact number of soldiers or amount of equipment that 
have been sent to saudi arabia but he said weve moved in

magellans first radar pictures of venus 
were released tuesday showing faults and lava flows like hawaii 
and idaho and parallel valleys and ridges like those between the 
sierra nevada and rockies 
the large number of fractures and venusquake faults seen in 
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that 
shaped the landscape are perhaps even more violent than i 
imagined before said steve saunders magellans chief scientist 
at jet propulsion laboratory 
overlapping lava flows of various ages and six to 10 miles 
wide appear as bright and dark splotches he said 
but saunders said the pictures dont yet show any of venus 
major volcanoes whether any of them are active or if the planets 
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole 
continents across the face of the earth previous spacecraft 
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes

a year ago abc began primetime live with a 
duo some called fire amp ice sam donaldson and diane sawyer their 
first show got more publicity than the first man to go over niagara 
falls in a beer firkin 
part of the hoopla was because the cool sawyer had recently 
joined abc to do the show with the brash donaldson it was summer 
and tv writers hadnt much to write about said abc news president 
roone arledge 
it was such an easy hype that abc people got carried away 
he wryly admitted as the onehour newsmagazine series began its 
second season of thursday broadcasts 
if he could do it all over again i would try to sneak it on 
the air he said noting that despite all the hoopla the show 
got only a 20 percent share of the audience in its time period when 
it premiered 
but things havent much improved in the nielsen department it 
generally has been third in ratings even last week when donaldson 
was dispatched to saudi arabia for a persian gulf crisis report 
there have been a few changes since last years premiere 
donaldson originally was teamed in a studio here with sawyer in 
hope the live atmosphere might result in crackling chemistry and 
snappy patter the chemistry proved uneasy the patter often forced 
with arledges blessings donaldson now usually does his part of 
the show in washington to which he returned in may 
how to use sam and diane has been an ongoing venture 
arledge said and whether this is the proper way or not well 
see 
but so far he said its worked out very well sam feels 
comfortable in washington he has done some of his best work 
there and it seems to work well so were going to keep it for 
the time being 
the studio audience is no more save for special occasions it 
was found too intrusive for use on a regular basis arledge said 
and there are more taped reports although alredge says all 
hands they include correspondents chris wallace judd rose and 
jay schadler are on alert for live targets of opportunity 
but the live part of the show now usually consists of sam 
and diane in their respective studios 
in his frank assessment of what went wrong the first year 
arledge said that somewhere we have an image problem caused in 
part by too much emphasis on the live of primetime live 
somehow in the original explanation of the program and i 
think we have to bear the blame for that the idea of liveness was 
distorted so that everything had to be live he said 
that never really was the intention he said the idea was 
to go live only when there was a sound reason to do so including a 
major breaking news story such as the january crash of an avianca 
jetliner here 
although he says primetime is starting to hit its stride and 
i think the program will define itself when people realize its a 
serious program he wishes it were not on abcs thursday roster 
arledge was not happy when abcs 2020 which starts its 
12th season this fall was shifted to friday from thursday nights 
in 1987 
as events proved though that show did much better in its new 
home averaging a 24 percent share of audience last season 
compared to a 17 percent share in its final season of thursday 
nights 
but arledge is not happy that primetime is on thursdays 
opposite cbs knots landing and nbcs la law 
if he had his druthers he said the show would air on tuesday 
nights where nbcs real life with jane pauley specials have 
had success or even on wednesday nights 
yes he said abc brass are mightily pleased with the show its 
turning a profit and its getting better ratings than the 
entertainment fare that it replaced a year ago but the idea of 
being in the toughest time period on television is not something 
that were happy with he said

his fame in hill street blues may have landed 
daniel j travanti a part on the london stage but he does not like 
being reminded of what he calls that series 
i will not say its name and i will not say that character 
said travanti who played capt frank furillo in the hit tv series 
which ended production in 1987 
but celebrity he admits has its rewards if i had not had 
that success i wouldnt have been asked to do this 
as a result tvs tightly wound precinct captain can be seen 
nightly at the ambassadors theater sporting an english accent and 
aristocratic garb in the longrunning play les liaisons 
dangereuses 
since june 18 he has been portraying the vicomte de valmont in 
christopher hamptons awardwinning tale of sexual cunning among 
the french haut monde inspired by choderlos de laclos 1782 novel 
the play now in its sixth year transferred to broadway in 
1987 and inspired the hit 1988 film dangerous liaisons with 
john malkovich as valmont 
im all trussed up and im pouring sweat travanti said of 
the assignment in which he is contracted through sept 29 
here i am doing a play thats more demanding than anything 
ive ever done and on top of everything else im fighting a 
3half minute sometimes fourminute fight with a 29yearold 
and im 50 he said early in the virtually 
streamofconsciousness monologue that constitutes an interview 
with him 
its a good thing im this healthy and sober and clear and 
have strong legs and all this energy he said sitting in the 
theater auditorium one recent afternoon before a brushup rehearsal 
as the actor makes clear such was not always the case after a 
promising beginning in the theater in regional theaters around the 
united states he took to drink and only faced up to his alcoholism 
after suffering a breakdown on tour in the play twigs in 1972 
a 1977 season at the old globe theater in san diego gave him 
renewed confidence but he had to wait until hill street was 
history before he could tackle the stage again 
there was very little chance of theater while i was doing 
the series he said of a schedule that left him just over three 
months off per year there wasnt enough preparation time plus 
playing time 
the liaisons offer came from the british productions 
american producer frank gero who met travanti 32 years ago in 
their home town kenosha wis 
i said sure id consider it how long and how much said 
travanti adding with a laugh that he knew the salary was not 
going to be much 
there were other enticements 
think of the exotic situation he said how many people 
get asked to go to the west end in an exquisite production we 
already know all its strengths we know there are no flaws to speak 
of 
travantis commitment to a film starting oct 8 means he cannot 
stay on in london but he is considering doing a short tour as 
valmont around europe in 1992 
the casting has had the desired effect at the london box office 
in a separate interview gero told the associated press that 
grosses increased by almost 25 percent in travantis first week 
the show is now playing to 75 percent to 80 percent capacity 
well above the 54 percent breakeven travantis arrival follows a 
slack spring during which gero said attendance was terrible for 
everybody 
the star for his part hopes to continue working on stage 
now ive got some opportunities and so what if im 50 years 
old travanti said theres still time ive got 10 good years 
to play the great roles 
none of which he believes are on television 
i will not do a crime of the week a social disorder of the 
week or a disease of the week said travanti and there is 
almost nothing else to choose from 
they talk about an important american miniseries and i say 
read my lips let me explain something to you there is no such 
thing as an important american miniseries 
there never has been he said and you can quote me on 
that

at a faith no more show there might be a 
few disgruntled faces amid the long hair and tattoos 
why because one of the bands favorite concert songs is its 
notefornote version of the commodores easylistening classic 
easy 
you read that right the commodores but its all part of the 
bands delight in making people a little angry at the same time 
its trying to give them what they want like a blistering cover of 
black sabbaths war pigs 
we just started doing it easy like two weeks ago 
bassist bill gould said in a telephone interview when we started 
doing war pigs we started doing it about three or four years ago 
and we were kind of like an underground band a punk band and it 
was very uncool to play black sabbath 
and thats kind of why we did it it became like a standard 
so now when we play it people start going war pigs war pigs 
the rock guys want to hear it so its about time to pull out the 
commodores he said with a laugh 
the californiabased band is an amalgam of styles tied together 
with a base of brutal guitar their second album on slashreprise 
records the real thing combines rap funk jazz and punk 
the bands main objective is to challenge itself to make itself 
happy the rest is up to the listener 
sometimes the music kind of turns people off on the first 
couple listens because its kind of strange gould said 
thats just the way it is the way it comes out this is the way 
we write music we cant help it it sounds like regular music to 
us 
and that music is almost agonizingly catchy both epic 
which now sits in billboards top 20 and falling to pieces 
incorporate the prerequisite heavy guitar sound but the lyrics are 
spoken as in rap not sung and they have hooks that just wont let 
go 
their lyrics pull no punches either faith no more sings of 
life rooted in obsession and colored in shades of gray but gould 
didnt see obsessions as being completely negative 
i think obsessions are a lot of fun he said 
theyre something to do right as long as you realize theyre 
obsessions i think theyre great things to indulge in as long as 
you can take em or leave em 
the band also likes to deal with keeping things in balance not 
emphasizing one thing over another gould likened that idea to a 
marriage which is built as he said on convention and ones own 
perception of reality 
you have to understand that its a convention and has no basis 
in reality except the reality you impose on it he said most 
people when they get about 45 or 50 years old realize that they 
were married to somebody and they were just cohabitating with them 
and that was it and theyve spent their whole lives doing it 
you have to understand that there is no real rule you 
have to realize that anything is subject to change 
faith no more was formed in 1982 by gould guitarist jim martin 
keyboardist roddy bottum drummer mike bordin and original vocalist 
chuck mosely their debut album on the independent mordam records 
label came out in 1986 and the track we care a lot received 
widespread college radio airplay 
that song was included on the bands first release on slash 
introduce yourself in 1987 which also found a home on college 
radio and the band played before packed houses here and abroad 
mosely left the band in 1988 and was replaced by 21yearold 
vocalist mike patton late of the san francisco funk band mr 
bungle the babyfaced singer has a voice that can go from a croon 
to a snarl to a wail sometimes in the same song 
gould saw pattons voice as not a separate entity but as 
another instrument which to him explained the bands use of rapped 
lyrics 
none of its just to be rapping but because we play a lot of 
counterrhythms the voice can be used as another instrument like a 
drum on top of the other drums and he just happens to be 
singing he said 
their music has been called intelligent metal by some but 
gould doesnt think intellectualism plays a role its more like 
being honest about things trying to put a little sense of reality 
into something 
we knew what we were doing was pretty good and its real 
gratifying that its finally being recognized he said

craftsmen are putting the finishing touches 
on a dream spanning generations of a restored mormon mecca on the 
mississippi 
completion of a log cabin and post office by oct 1 will cap the 
extraordinary rebirth of a city known in its heyday as nauvoo the 
beautiful the center of the mormon world for seven years in the 
mid19th century 
the mormons have spent more than 15 million over 28 years to 
restore more than two dozen homes and shops and to build two 
visitor centers and a 700acre farm dotted with 330 head of cattle 
people come here because its a historical setting said 
elder loren c dunn president of nauvoo restoration inc by 
telling the story of nauvoo we are also telling the story of the 
church the people are coming in through the historical door 
from 1839 to 1846 the swampland below a bend in the mississippi 
river some 80 miles upstream from hannibal mo was transformed 
into a bustling city of 12000 mormons fleeing mob violence in 
missouri and converts arriving from great britain were among the 
newcomers 
a rival of chicago as the most populous illinois city nauvoo 
was where church founder joseph smiths vision of a theocracy 
achieved its fullest flowering but just as before in missouri 
political economic and religious differences with nonmormon 
neighbors degenerated into armed conflict 
less than two years after smith was slain by a mob in nearby 
carthage in 1844 the city of joseph stood a virtual shell the 
mormons under brigham young made their pioneering exodus to the 
great basin 
the mormons didnt forget nauvoo decades after having left in 
sorrow pilgrims returned seeking a sense of their past one 
making the trip after 78 years put his thoughts to verse 
in 46 i left nauvoo 
behind an old oxen team 
now im going back in a henry ford 
to see how it will seem 
j leroy kimball a salt lake city physician whose patients 
included several top officials of the mormon church believed 
nauvoo could be reborn kimballs powers of persuasion were a match 
for his healing skills 
when youre there in a doctors office with your clothes off 
youre kind of forced to listen recalls his son james l 
kimball dad really pushed the idea that something should be 
done 
several of his captive listeners journeyed to nauvoo in 1960 to 
see the home of heber c kimball a smith associate and kimballs 
greatgrandfather the doctor had purchased the house in 1954 and 
restored it kimball and others who had bought homes or property 
were prepared to donate them to the church 
mindful that any largescale mormon effort would drive up land 
values and inflame antimormon sentiments church leaders in 1962 
established the nonprofit corporation to do the restoration 
the churchs 1250 acres of old nauvoo includes 23 restored 
homes and shops the reorganized church of jesus christ of 
latterday saints which split with the mormons after the nauvoo 
period has restored another 44acre section that includes joseph 
smiths residence and grave site 
the pastoral serenity hard by the big river and down a verdant 
hill from the modern town of 1100 inhabitants verges on the 
mythic a scholar of the citys story calls it a dreamscape 
almost a nauvoo of the imagination locals boast that it is 
the colonial williamsburg of the midwest 
thats the problem historians grouse 
although the project was carefully researched by archaeologists 
architects and historians it has drawn criticism from scholars who 
say its wellmanicured grounds and brick structures bear little 
resemblance to the original 
people who go to nauvoo and think they have seen the real 
nauvoo are sadly mistaken said robert bruce flanders a 
southwest missouri state historian of the town its true of 
nauvoo as of williamsburg it really doesnt look anything like 
nauvoo did in 1845 
still flanders gives the church high marks for its restoration 
of individual buildings like brigham youngs home and is unaware of 
any site where there is so little development overlaying an old 
settlement 
dunn has heard the criticisms and tries to put them in 
perspective there are not any two historians that will agree 
what nauvoo was really like he said and weve tried to 
restore it to the best of our ability 
dunn points out that the brick structures were the ones that 
survived in the best condition and once restored are far less 
expensive to maintain 
still sensitive to the preponderance of brick nauvoo 
restoration is erecting an authentic log cabin and a detailed 
model and film in the visitor center seek to correct any false 
impression about whats outside 
its too clean and too beautiful and you are seeing it at its 
sunday best concedes kimballs son who is senior librarian for 
the churchs historical department but i think the saints who 
left nauvoo carried in their minds the vision of what it could have 
been or will be again

plastics 
in the 1960s movie the graduate it was the one word of 
advice imparted to benjamin at his graduation party 
updated to the 90s in winona it still rings true as a sign of 
the times albeit a lot less cynically 
the mississippi river town is acknowledged as one of the 
birthplaces of spaceage plastics its longrunning love affair 
with the industry has produced a storybook tale of bigtime success 
in a small town 
winona companies have manufactured materials used to make 
heatresistant parts for the b2 stealth bomber solid rocket 
booster exhaust cones on us space shuttles airplane doors body 
panels for grand prix cars racing kayaks automobile bumpers and 
graphite fishing rods 
were not the hub like some people say but we are certainly 
one of the spokes said stan prosen a consultant in winona known 
as an industry godfather for his work in 1963 on a carbon 
fiberlaced o ring used to develop the polaris missile 
we do have a subset of the technology here that is 
spectacular said richard enochs of ici fiberite the nations 
largest manufacturer of materials for advanced composites the 
industrys term for hightech plastics 
unlike mere thermoplastics composites are a mix of stiff fibers 
woven or otherwise combined with resins they can be as strong as 
steel and lighter than aluminum 
they are industrial pioneers in this industry said dennis 
nielsen chairman of the engineering department at winona state 
university 
inspired by the success nielsen has helped to open the nations 
first undergraduate degree program in composite materials 
engineering with the help this year of 104 million in state money 
to build an oncampus home for the program 
were recruiting heavily from southern california the 
industrys heartland nielsen said it gives us national 
identity and thats hard to find in academia 
winona got its start in advanced composites in 1948 when rudy 
and ben miller founded fiberite and joined the ussoviet space 
race fiberite contributed rocket components light enough for 
launching and strong enough to withstand hellish temperatures 
unlike regular plastics composites can be tough and stiff 
without being flimsy or brittle they resist corrosion cut noise 
absorb impact and enable the b2 stealth bomber to duck radar 
detection 
the composites industry directly accounts for about 1000 of the 
20000 jobs in winona said judith bodway local economic 
development director to stimulate even more activity the city is 
seeking 584000 in state money to fund the fledgling advanced 
composites manufacturing center she said 
we know that composites have a huge future bodway said 
the office of technology assessment for the us congress 
estimates that sales of advanced composite components produced in 
the united states will soar from 2 billion in 1989 to 20 billion 
at the turn of the century 
enochs said winona is expected to share in that gain even if 
defense spending slows down production is shifting to auto making 
electronics construction commercial aviation recreation and 
other sectors 
the biggest hurdle is automation enochs said the expense of 
composites will continue to prohibit new uses until tools are 
developed for mass production 
its just a question of time enochs said there is no 
question that these industries continue to be driven by the 
properties that advanced composites can bring to them 
consider the allplastic small engine of a new jersey customer 
of fiberite or the plastic truck tire rims being made by a customer 
of winonabased polymer composites inc 
our basic strategy is metal replacement said pat johnson 
vice president of sales and marketing for polymer composites 
since fiberite was purchased in 1984 by great britains imperial 
chemicals industries company growth has been distributed to plants 
in other cities including sites in japan and germany 
but fiberite was the genesis for at least five spinoff 
companies still vibrant inside winona county 
sales at rtp co for example have more than doubled from the 
1983 level of 18 million and are expected to grow another 10 
percent this year said hugh miller chairman and chief executive 
were growing so fast i have trouble thinking back four or 
five years ago said miller whose company makes reinforced 
plastic pellets with conductive properties used in the computer and 
electronics industries 
once a division of fiberite rtp was sold to beatrice co in 
1980 and is now headed by miller the son of fiberite cofounder 
ben miller 
polymer composites also has fiberite roots it was started in 
1980 by former fiberite chemist ron hawley eight years later 
hawley sold the business to a subsidiary of hoechst ag a west 
german conglomerate 
after a brief retirement hawley last year founded another 
startup composite products inc 
its like that here said stephen bowen polymer composites 
chief executive if one company in winona sells out usually they 
move down the block and start another operation 
the enterprising spirit has also struck the university where 
professor myron snesrud helps operate a small scale contract 
research facility that expects to count the us navy as a customer 
soon 
it will be one of the selling points of the schools new 
composites engineering program which snesrud hopes will attract 
250 topnotch students 
the story isnt out yet snesrud said mostly its 
children of people in the industry who know about it

eleanor and isaac cullick are the kind of people 
who take time to chat with strangers but they were barely speaking 
to each other when their 12year marriage broke up in 1971 
he was a lecturer it seemed that every time he spoke to me 
it was a critique said eleanor who now lives in houston i 
dont think he was the type of person who could share 
experiences and emotions and feelings 
all i ever did was listen said isaac who is remarried and 
still lives in shreveport la she was going to have things her 
way i couldnt reach eleanor its amazing people can live 
together but cant talk things out 
the cullicks story is not unique and in her new best seller 
you just dont understand women and men in conversation 
georgetown university sociolinguist deborah tannen suggests why 
because men and women are regarding the landscape from 
contrasting vantage points the same scene can appear very 
different to them and they often have opposite interpretations of 
the same action 
no one is to blame here the author cautions 
its just that people of different genders generally speak 
different languages tannen reached that conclusion after studying 
hundreds of hours of videotaped conversations between men and 
women boys and girls 
men and women grow up in different worlds tannen said in a 
recent interview its utterly essential that people accept and 
understand the differences otherwise we end up blaming each 
other 
over 15 years of research tannen said shes seen clear 
conversational patterns emerge men use talk primarily to 
communicate a desire or goal while women consider exchanges 
important in and of themselves she said 
to a woman hashing through the days details often indicates 
intimacy for her mate the ritual may simply seem a drag 
similarly she said women often feel a relationship is 
working if youre talking about it men feel its working if youre 
not talking about it 
a lot of men feel that a womans insistence on talking things 
out is like a dog hanging onto a bone said tannen who lives and 
teaches in washington but for women talk is the glue that holds 
relationships together 
these are stereotypes but sociolinguists said they apply more 
often than not since the publication of her book this spring 
tannen said she has received scores of telephone calls and letters 
from fans of her theory 
misunderstood gender differences is one of the biggest causes 
of divorce said howard markman who directs the university of 
denvers center for marital and family studies 
its a pervasive problem but couples who learn how to 
understand each other can successfully improve their chances of 
having a happy marriage the marital researcher said 
john and kass patterson did the couple took markmans 
premarital relationship enhancement program before they wed two 
years ago today they are expecting their first child 
a lot of people wondered why we took the course said kass 
who lives with her husband in denver but it really helped us get 
our marriage off on the right foot 
it wasnt that the couple would otherwise have started out in a 
tangle of unusual problems the pattersons just didnt want to 
waste time bickering about the banal finances tardiness who 
interrupted whom 
women are trained throughout their lives on how to talk things 
out and express feelings said kass 30 a legal secretary i 
am still more the one that pulls things out of john but since the 
course hes much more vocal 
each also understands better what the other is trying to say 
you become aware of the differences in the way you argue 
kass said sometimes theres no changing the other person but 
understanding eases the frustration 
decoding the ways men and women communicate is not only helpful 
on the homefront sociolinguists said genderbased conflicts show 
up and can be resolved in the workplace as well 
take for instance the way in which a male employee interpreted 
an order from barbara meade coowner of politics amp prose bookstore 
in washington 
i wanted him to do some specific tasks having to do with 
bookkeeping and thought it was understood meade recalled 
but apparently he thought i was asking if hed be willing to 
do it 
tannen says this is common women often couch a direct order in 
an interrogative phrase would you mind whereas men usually 
say simply do it 
both bosses may be issuing an order she said but a male 
employee will likely interpret a female bosss request as optional 
while a female employee will often find her male bosss style 
unnecessarily peremptory 
its like speaking english and french its not that one is 
better than the other said robin lakoff a linguist at the 
university of california at berkeley they are just different 
gender studies experts whose field has blossomed since the late 
1970s said the communication gap is rooted in childhood boys and 
girls generally play separately and interact differently 
researchers said 
boys groups are hierarchical and activitiesoriented 
tannen said girls groups tend to be egalitarian smaller they 
tend to have one best friend and spend a lot of time telling 
secrets 
when they grow up women often expect their mates to be that 
same best friend which often baffles men more comfortable with 
locker room towelsnapping than sharing secrets 
tannen said couples can reach a happy medium with time patience 
and compromise but it will take a lot more to change the 
fundamental mindsets that separate men and women researchers said 
the kinds of language differences we see reflect real 
differences in the way men and women are in the world said penny 
eckert of the institute for research on learning in palo alto 
calif 
language is symptomatic of other things of underlying power 
relations in a maledominated society eckert said 
tannens book is only a point of departure a place to start 
discussing sexism

even as the highest court in the land 
drifts rightward the highest court in new jersey is staking out 
bold stands in the opposite direction and it is gaining influence 
the impact this court has had is incredible said ronald 
kl collins a state court expert and a visiting associate 
professor at catholic university in washington dc 
there is a battle going on between the united states supreme 
court and the new jersey supreme court for the conscience of the 
courts across the country on many issues the question is do we 
go with the united states supreme court or with new jersey 
collins said 
to go with new jersey is take a dizzying tour of judicial 
activism 
in the past three months alone the new jersey court has ruled 
the state must ensure that as much money is spent to educate 
children in poor cities as is spent on those in wealthy suburbs 
that police cannot sift through roadside trash without a search 
warrant and that warning labels on cigarette packages cannot 
shield tobacco companies from liability suits 
these decisions add to a legacy of assertiveness this was the 
court that allowed karen ann quinlans parents to remove their 
comatose daughter from a respirator and condemned surrogate 
motherhood in the baby m case 
the court also has ordered that housing for lowincome residents 
be built in every municipality it has ruled that poor women have 
the right to statefinanced abortions to protect their health 
when the court found that the state wasnt contributing enough 
dollars to provide a fair education to poor students 14 years ago 
it closed public schools the legislature then adopted an income 
tax to come up with the money 
often the seven state justices are on a collision course with 
the us supreme court in these cases new jersey justices rely on 
the states 43yearold constitution saying it provides greater 
protections than afforded by federal court decisions 
richard j hughes a former governor and chief justice who wrote 
the landmark quinlan decision said the new jersey state 
constitution is a font of individual liberties thats why our 
court many times goes a little further than the united states 
supreme court 
constitutional experts say such actions are spurring other state 
supreme courts to become more aggressive 
the new jersey panel is helping set a course where state bills 
of rights are seen as independent sources of bills of rights 
said g alan tarr chairman of the political science department at 
rutgers university and an author of several books on the court 
but critics say the new jersey court goes too far 
the new jersey supreme court makes earl warren seem like a 
timid soul said bruce fein a constitutional scholar and former 
official with the conservative heritage foundation theyve been 
involved in social engineering and theyve been rather inept at 
it 
he rejects the notion that new jersey is leading an offensive by 
state courts only about a dozen courts are becoming more 
active he said leaving 38 reasonably conservative courts that 
stay with the us supreme court 
other courts didnt always turn to new jersey before the 
adoption of the 1947 constitution its courts were political plums 
harvested by party bosses 
we discarded the worst court system in the country for the 
best said hughes 
constitutional experts say a combination of factors have led new 
jersey down a path few courts have traveled although lawmakers and 
governors have criticized the court they have stayed clear of 
exacting political revenge the new jersey justices are appointed 
not elected the governor and state senate can remove or reappoint 
justices seven years after they join the court if they are 
reappointed they serve until age 70 
they have the ability to get involved without too much 
political backlash said tarr there are no elections they can 
make decisions without playing political football 
tarr noted that former gov thomas h kean who branded the 
courts decision on lowincome housing communistic nonetheless 
reappointed two justices who supported it including chief justice 
robert n wilentz 
some of the courts landmark decisions have been a matter of 
coincidence the quinlan and baby m cases just happened to take 
place in new jersey 
but supporters and critics agree the courts reputation is no 
coincidence in new jersey the supreme court has long had no 
qualms about hearing cases other courts wont touch and it has 
consistently said government has an obligation to protect 
individual rights 
the court has said you show us a case with enough injustice 
and we will not refrain from acting collins said 
the courts actions on lowincome housing and school funding 
link constitutional justice to economic justice he said it 
says that justice is not limited to liberty but also to economics 
this is constitutional law at its zenith and its most controversial 
stage 
it has raised the ire of critics who say the court is stretching 
the state constitution their imagination has been triggered by 
something other than the state constitution the court is making 
all of these obligations out of nothing fein said 
as the federal courts become more conservative experts agree 
the new jersey supreme court will continue to command center stage 
the new jersey court has spawned an environment about the kind 
of cases that can be tried there said collins cases that 
wont go before other courts will come to new jersey

the night was filled with fierce mosquitoes 
humidity thick as an invisible syrup and the cries of a politician 
railing against indolent welfare recipients 
i dont mind them having illegitimate babies ladies and 
gentlemen david duke shouted to supporters at a coastal rally 
i just dont think we should have to pay for them 
duke is the head of the national association for the advancement 
of white people former grand wizard of the knights of the ku klux 
klan a man who once wore a swastika they are white and 
bluecollar workers and they hope to elect him to the us senate 
as he continued his tirade against welfare cheats and 
affirmative action they swapped horror stories of welfare abuse 
of waiting at grocery counters to buy bologna while welfare mothers 
bought steaks with food stamps 
nearly 500 strong they stood as one roaring approval when he 
talked of working for benefits and competing for jobs on merit 
when he charged that the liberals in washington had sold working 
men and women down the river many responded with open yells that 
the niggers are taking over 
duke a boyishlooking 40 was elected last year to the 
louisiana house from the new orleans suburbs his bills aimed at 
welfare and affirmative action have met with no success but he has 
proven himself an articulate spokesman for the far right his fans 
regard him as more than a messenger they see him as a savior 
dukes the only chance weve got to let america know were 
tired of those lazy bastards collecting checks a woman yelled 
over the din of a typical duke rally 
we want people to get off their ass and go to work said an 
elderly postmaster in a tiny rural community who showed up to hear 
duke in central louisiana weve got to have someone stand up for 
us were paying the tab for the coloreds even our president is a 
niggerlover 
duke drew widespread attention in 1973 when as a university 
student he demonstrated in a nazi uniform against antiwar 
protesters later in the 1970s he took off his hood as the 
persuasive head of the klan 
he was accused of trying to sell secret klan membership lists 
and in 1980 he left the kkk and formed the naawp in the next few 
years he ran unsuccessfully for a state senate seat wrote for a 
living and operated a bookstore 
he defeated the brother of former republican gov dave treen for 
a state house seat in 1989 and only a few months later started 
talking about the us senate race 
the national gop has repudiated dukes candidacy and let out a 
collective groan when he opened a washington office under the 
auspices of a group called republican action for the 90s the 
duke revolution of the 90s will collapse liberalism at home the 
group said in a letter to conservatives 
while duke builds steam us sen bennett johnston dla has 
barely launched his reelection campaign and state sen ben bagert 
the designated republican nominee is a distant third despite 
appearances with ollie north and robert bork 
a recent poll for television stations gave johnston 52 percent 
of the voters support duke 24 percent and bagert 7 percent 
all three and another three unknowns will compete oct 6 in an 
open primary professional political consultants say duke has a 
good shot at keeping johnston below 50 percent and thereby forcing 
a runoff in november but they say ultimately he wont be able to 
overcome the threeterm senate veteran 
johnston has urged voters to avoid a runoff saying it would 
attract even more undesirable national attention to the state 
it matters what people outside louisiana think said 
johnston we dont want people to think were like south africa 
people dont invest their money there 
gus weill the dean of louisianas political consultants 
attributed much of dukes appeal to the states ailing economy 
in louisiana we are absolutely in hard times and duke has 
presented us with a villain black people weill said hell 
get support that will surprise some people but there arent enough 
callous people in this state to elect him 
linus juneau head of the american legion in tiny bordelonville 
predicted a large number of world war ii veterans will back duke 
people like what he says about giveaways he said theyre 
not concerned about the past 
duke has spent more than 12 million so far to convince voters 
that he repudiates the reckless past of my youth i was 
intolerant im ashamed of that he stresses in every appearance 
that his past is dead 
there are indications however that duke has not undergone a 
complete transformation as late as 1989 his bookstore still was 
selling pronazi literature and on a television talk show this 
month he was asked about racial songs including one called 
some niggers never die that he recently sold in his 
bookstore he called them humorous 
the rev james stovall chairman of the louisiana coalition 
against racism and nazism said dukes remarks prove he is still 
a bigot and a hater 
whatever he is duke believes he is speaking for millions you 
may think my message is just mine he told one audience but 
what im saying openly is what the other politicians are saying in 
private if a man with my past can be elected to the us senate 
more politicians will follow and america will be heard

the islanders are restless hordes of tourists are 
pouring into their hallowed sanctuaries intruding upon their 
ancient ways corrupting them with cash snapping their pictures 
it sounds like a familiar lament from some exotic corner of the 
old empire but these islanders are the british and many are fed 
up with the more than 17 million tourists passing annually through 
their small and crowded realm 
the problem has become serious enough to merit a government task 
force the english tourist board has produced a leaflet that 
appeals to visitors foreign and domestic to behave themselves 
always remember you are the guest show consideration for 
residents and their environment the leaflet begins respect 
local laws and customs it is called 20 tips for visitors 
it advises tourists not to photograph the locals without 
permission to refrain from touching valuable tapestries vases and 
paintings avoid wearing highheeled shoes in historic buildings 
and dress appropriately in holy places 
although william davis chairman of the tourist board insisted 
in launching the leaflet that we dont want to nag some of the 
tips have a distinctly nannyish tone 
tourists are advised to say please and thank you and when 
complaining to do it politely 
dont argue with staff who seek to enforce rules it says 
they are only doing their jobs 
and inevitably dont push shove or jump queues 
davis says the leaflet does not mean to single out foreigners as 
the sole offenders it isnt being translated into other languages 
but it comes at a time of heated debate about whether tourism is 
good for the nation 
foreign tourism generates 42 billion a year for britain and 
employs 15 million people making it a prime moneyearner as heavy 
industry declines 
it is spreading well beyond the familiar landmarks of london 
foreign tourism in oxford rose 44 percent between 1983 and 1988 
bath recorded a 38 percent increase york and canterbury 33 percent 
internal tourism measured by the 109 million overnight hotel 
stays in 1989 also is a vast industry 
some of the people under invasion are protesting and this has 
prompted the government to announce a task force to identify 
problem areas 
i travel around the country a lot and have noticed a growing 
tension about tourism and we are seeking a way of heading off a 
backlash which could damage the entire industry said ivor 
manley the employment department official chosen to head the team 
in some areas like portsmouth or bradford a museum is 
welcomed as a badge of civic pride but in others such a plan would 
cause resentment he said at a news conference they do not 
want tourists in their town and will not build for them 
officials say they want to spread tourism to less familiar 
territory such as liverpool or the romney marshes of kent county 
rather than head straight for westminster abbey how about seeing 
the victorian cotton mills of lancashire or going down into a 
yorkshire coal mine 
davis of the tourist board worries about the growing tendency 
to use the word tourist as a term of abuse 
phrases such as tourism plague and hordes he protests 
are totally and utterly inappropriate to describe visitors whom 
we ought to be making feel welcome in this country 
lately arguments are being heard that tourism is more trouble 
than its worth 
tourist coaches congest the central area and park with 
impunity alfred sherman wrote in the sunday telegraph public 
buildings are disfigured by displays of gimcrack souvenirs the 
tawdry nightlife which mass tourism evokes makes our city centers 
and suburbs even more vicious 
the times of london concluded the solution was to ration tourism 
by making the main attractions charge prices high enough to deter 
at least some potential visitors 
it is an uncongenial concept the paper admitted yet both 
elitists and populists must accept that only some form of rationing 
can avoid the destruction of places that all the world wants to 
visit

next to a 
rutted tank trail on this training base between leningrad and the 
finnish border a poster still exhorts serve as lenin 
instructed as the party demands 
the soviet union legalized alternative political groups five 
months ago but the communist party is only just beginning to 
loosen its dictatorial control over the military 
at this point the army does not have a multiparty system 
said col leonid aksuita one of about 80000 professional 
political officers among the 4 million military personnel 
political officers have spent decades enforcing communist party 
orders in the army 
among the more notable were nikita khrushchev and leonid 
brezhnev who moved back into regular party jobs after world war ii 
service as political officers and eventually ruled the country 
col pavel medvedev said the party relinquished formal control 
of military promotions since losing its constitutionally guaranteed 
monopoly on power in march but acknowledged there had been no 
reduction in the partys influence 
change clearly is under way however and political officers are 
seeking new roles in such fields as psychology and public relations 
this infantry training base named for the young communist 
league still drips with redpainted party slogans draftees pore 
over propaganda pamphlets and newspapers in the lenin room of their 
barracks 
a young azerbaijani with a shaven head hunched over a pamphlet 
surrounded by images of the partys revered founder just five 
weeks into training he already had been assigned as a party 
activist and said fellow draftees accepted his proselytizing 
had any soldiers ever tried to organize around an alternative 
political viewpoint he shook his head and replied everybody 
wants to represent the communist party 
every unit still has a party committee that concerns itself with 
everything from combat training to officer housing soldiers said 
at the national party congress in july reformers tried 
unsuccessfully to have the committees abolished 
a deputy commander in each unit serves as its political officer 
party reformers also tried to eliminate that position in a 
compromise the zampolit officers are turning from political 
indoctrination to more practical matters like morale discipline 
and recreation 
even gen valentin varennikov commander of soviet land forces 
and a highranking communist has a zampolit assigned to him 
my husband could not be a unit commander if he was not a party 
member said lyudmila leshishina wife of a major at a paratroop 
base on the polish border near brest 
communist control is so pervasive that it will be years before 
the benefits of multiparty democracy come to the army said 
officers and soldiers interviewed during a twoday press tour 
all the persons i work with are communists and have the same 
points of view said ivan skrylnik of the defense ministrys new 
information department 
at four bases in three republics soldiers scoffed at the 
possibility of a noncommunist political party trying to organize 
within the army 
literally in the next 10 years its impossible because 98 
percent of the officers and sergeants are communists said gen 
vladislav lisovsky deputy commander of the leningrad military 
district 
gen boris gromov commander of the kiev military district and 
former commander of soviet forces in afghanistan seemed almost 
puzzled when asked whether the partys influence was diminishing 
i am a communist he said i know the decisions of the 
party and i enforce them myself 
switching the political officers from representing the party to 
representing the government is expected to make little difference 
immediately since all zampolits are communists 
they acknowledged however that their lives were changing 
dramatically 
people are different than they were three years ago and 
unanimity has given way to political debate said col pavel 
illarionov a political officer at the leningrad base 
we cant give commands anymore said col aksuita political 
officer of the minsk district we have to educate 
the stereotypical zampolit who earned the enmity of his peers 
for interfering with military orders apparently has not entirely 
disappeared 
its a dangerous question medvedev replied when asked about 
such men then added 
their activity has dropped since the brezhnev days seven 
years ago it seems as if they are not sure of themselves and not 
sure of what to do 
political officers duties are expected to change even more 
because the july party congress decided they must stop preaching 
the party line and concentrate on the general welfare of soldiers 
theyll be like uh chaplains said capt vadim v zvegin 
in an earnest attempt to explain 
many political officers are going back to college to earn 
degrees in psychology and sociology said skrylnik of the military 
press office and others are taking the new job of press officer 
we have much more work with the mass media illarionov said 
it used to be they always helped us he added with evident 
nostalgia for the days when the press always followed orders

the endangered species act is a powerful tool 
for saving wildlife but power has a price development now must 
steer clear of nearly 600 species no easy task as a hunt for 
phantoms in the forest shows 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was morning in the redwoods 
and simpson timber cos owl safari was off to a shaky start 
hoot hoothoot hoooooooo company biologist lowell diller 
called into the forest then cocked his head to listen 
but there was no reply 
diller and 17 biologists from the california department of fish 
and game were touring simpson timbers holdings along the northern 
california coast their quarry the northern spotted owl one of 
the latest and most controversial additions to the us endangered 
species list 
environmentalists portray the owl as a victim of human greed a 
shy bird whose home in the northwest forest is imperiled by 
loggers saws 
simpson paints a different picture that of a creature neither 
shy nor particularly threatened by heavy logging on the companys 
400000 acres we have owls practically everywhere diller 
promised 
now all he had to do was make one show 
hoot hoothoot hoooooooo he called again 
but there was no reply

if the effort to save americas endangered wildlife can be 
called a war and many wildlife biologists are fond of that 
analogy then places like simpsons timberland are at the front 
line 
such conflicts between wildlife preservation and economic 
development are the legacy of the federal endangered species act 
the 1973 law mandates recovery plans for dwindling wildlife 
populations and bars any disturbance of species listed as 
threatened or endangered the acts yellow and redalert 
labels for creatures nearing extinction 
at its signing the act was hailed as a visionary stand for 
wildlife decimated by habitat destruction pollution and 
overhunting 
but vision doesnt come cheaply recovery plans for a growing 
list of imperiled species are clashing with paychecks and 
pocketbooks as never before 
examples span the country 
saving the spotted owl declared threatened in june may 
become the most economically disruptive recovery program yet 
launched under the act in one scenario proposed by federal 
scientists logging bans to protect the 6000 to 10000 owls left 
in california oregon and washington could cost 28000 jobs over 10 
years 
in the gulf of mexico shrimp fishermen have blockaded 
harbors rammed boats and fired shots to protest regulations aimed 
at keeping their nets from drowning at least 11000 endangered sea 
turtles a year 
in the southeast timber companies oppose a federal program to 
protect some 10000 redcockaded woodpeckers by closing 12 million 
acres of national forest to logging 
in arizona construction of a 200 million mountaintop 
observatory is pitted against the mount graham red squirrel a 
subspecies of 150 animals found only on the mountain 
and there are many more from las vegas where the desert 
tortoise is blamed for delaying floodcontrol projects and housing 
tracts to rhode island where a popular nude beach was fenced off 
this summer to protect a shorebird called the piping plover 
the list of endangered and threatened us species now includes 
588 plants mammals fishes birds beetles butterflies reptiles 
frogs snails spiders and clams 
endangered clams some say the law has gone too far including 
interior secretary manuel lujan he has repeatedly urged congress 
to weaken the endangered species act to allow more consideration of 
economics 
do we have to save every subspecies lujan asked in may 
nobodys told me the difference between a red squirrel a black 
one or a brown one 
but environmentalists say the laws work has just begun their 
argument humans drove most of these creatures to the brink of 
extinction so humans have a duty to rescue them all of them red 
black or brown 
such polarized rhetoric erupts whenever economic development 
runs afoul of an endangered species say observers of the debate 
later when heads cool and compromise begins both sides look to 
science for facts how many creatures are out there what will a 
recovery plan cost and will it do any good 
unfortunately the questions come easier than answers as was 
evident one recent summer day in the redwoods

hoot hoothoot hoooooooo this time it was the real 
thing an owl called from somewhere in the trees and lowell diller 
dashed off leading a stampede of wildlife officials through the 
brush 
there diller said pointing to a branch 25 feet up where a 
female owl perched her talons clutching a dead wood rat a fluffy 
owlet sat nearby its creamcolored plumage contrasting with the 
mothers darker mottled feathers the adult male with his 
hoothoot call stayed hidden some distance away 
according to the established scientific literature none of 
these owls should have been here 
northern spotted owls the literature says nest in cavities of 
decaying centuriesold trees in the virgin or oldgrowth forest 
of the pacific northwest the birds supposedly need the open space 
among the old trees to hunt rodents and the treetop canopy to avoid 
predators 
nobody would mistake simpsons industrial timberland for the 
kind of forest wilderness that environmentalists want set aside for 
owls the company started logging giant old redwoods here at the 
turn of the century and now is clearcutting a second generation of 
trees burned and blackened stumps dot the naked hills 
but spotted owls seem to thrive here diller has banded more 
than 125 owls since march he estimates there is a nesting pair of 
owls per 1000 acres one of the highest densities ever reported 
the birds nest in trees as young as 30 years old often using 
platforms of woody debris on branches rather than avoid 
clearcuts many nest in patches of trees near them perhaps to 
hunt the abundant wood rats diller said 
its very hard to put limits on what spottedowl habitat is 
he said we have some interesting things to learn 
the same is true about many endangered species which by their 
nature are often hard to study 
the spotted owl at least hoots back 
compare it to the marbled murrelet a chunky little seabird 
recently proposed for the endangered list the murrelet is believed 
to nest in coastal oldgrowth forest from california to alaska 
despite extensive searching however fewer than 20 nests of the 
secretive bird have ever been found 
or consider bartrams ixia a florida wildflower that blooms but 
one day a year a proposal to give the plant endangered status 
prompted timber companies to launch a hunt for it in may they hope 
to derail the listing by showing that ixia isnt rare just hard to 
spot 
things were simpler in the early years of the endangered species 
act enforcement concentrated on creatures a heartbeat away from 
extinction such as the whooping crane or california condor 
but now protection plans are in place for most of those 
highprofile cases attention is turning toward species more 
obscure more widely distributed or further from extinction 
the us fish and wildlife service adds four or five species to 
the endangered list every month and the task is far from done 
researchers face a backlog of more than 3000 candidates assuring 
controversy over endangered species for decades

no matter what you may have heard the ordinary 
american isnt a financial and economic fool who buys on impulse 
invests on tips borrows recklessly and ignores the news 
that sometimes is the reputation they are given by those who 
like to claim superior knowledge such as certain economists and 
financial advisers who live off the claim that they can see into 
the future 
but when the chips are down when the economys future is in 
doubt who do these people turn to for advice none other than the 
consumer whose aggregate buying selling or savings often 
determines economic direction 
consumers speak with their pocketbooks theirs is a real world 
where they watch their cash 
growth in personal consumption in the second quarter fell to the 
lowest rate since the 19811982 recession the increase in retail 
sales last month was an almost imperceptible 01 percent 
consumer spending for nondurable items such as food and 
clothing in the second quarter actually fell 1 percent from the 
comparable period a year earlier and spending on durables such as 
cars and furniture also fell 
consumers are pulling in their credit cards installment credit 
in the first half of the year rose at only a 23 percent annual 
rate a fraction of the increase last year the personal savings 
rate has been rising 
in such numbers as these lie strong almost certain clues to the 
future because the consumer economy makes up twothirds of gross 
national product more by far than government and business together 
these are the clues that socalled experts examine before 
telling ordinary mortals what they think the economic future holds 
it makes expert forecasting easy the consumer has already told 
the expert what to expect 
the consumers intelligence about these matters is nearly 
foolproof it comes not from abstractions relied upon by many 
intellectual theorists but from hard data contained in the family 
checking account money speaks 
disposable income during the years first half mainly money 
left after taxes rose at a rate of just 15 percent a year less 
than onethird the rate of 1988 and well below that of 1989 
if you havent got the income you cant continue with the outgo 
at least for very long many consumers tried that 
credittoincome ratios are near record highs but theres a 
limit and millions have reached it 
there are many concrete dollarandcents reasons therefore 
for changes in consumer spending and saving there are more 
intellectual reasons too based on consumer interpretations of the 
state of domestic and world affairs 
throughout this year consumers have expressed doubts about the 
economys continued strength they have read about the decline in 
profits of washingtons inability to deal with the budget of woes 
in financial circles 
now they face the prospect of higher energy prices and an 
economy that might have to be directed more to military purposes 
and less to the production of marketplace items uncertainty 
including job insecurity is widespread 
all this blunts the urge to spend and spurs the urge to 
conserve and in the process tends to change the direction of the 
economy 
in a sense consumer power directs the economys future which 
is a lot more than can be claimed by the experts

employees at survival technology inc are 
accelerating production of an item they hope will never be used a 
nerve gas antidote for american troops in the mideast 
it helps the company but youve got to be concerned because 
it means theres a war going on somewhere and thats not good 
said j frank harmon director of manufacturing for the companys 
pharmaceutical division 
survival technology based in bethesda md makes 95 percent of 
the noncommunist worlds supply of the antidote at its plant here 
in suburban st louis 
it is the only american supplier of the antidote which troops 
in the persian gulf area may need if iraqi president saddam hussein 
uses his stockpile of deadly poisonous gases 
six days after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 the defense 
department asked the company to speed up production of 85000 kits 
it wasnt scheduled to deliver until the end of september 
at the same time the government asked for an additional 2 
million worth which harmon said amounted to several hundred 
thousand kits of two autoinject drugfilled syringes 
in response the company delayed its annual summer maintenance 
shutdown and asked 31 production employees to postpone vacations to 
help finish the order over the weekend all said they would 
they take tremendous pride in manufacturing something knowing 
that lives are very literally at stake harmon said 
employees said they didnt mind canceling vacation plans and 
working 10and 12hour days to get the order completed 
you know its a crucial time but were glad to be here to be 
able to help support the government said employee wanda moose 
every syringe i make is just like saving a life 
harmon said the company expected to ship the second order in 
about a month additional orders from friendly foreign governments 
also are expected to come in he said unlike the united states 
some countries do not have any of the antidote in stock 
the federal governments request came as us troops and planes 
moved into saudi arabia for a possible confrontation with iraq 
although chemical warfare was banned by the geneva disarmament 
conference in 1971 because of its heinous nature iraq used nerve 
gas and mustard gas in its eightyear war with iran and against its 
own kurdish minority 
while there is no known antidote to mustard gas which burns the 
skin on contact the antidote survival technology makes is 
effective against all known forms of nerve gas harmon said 
the antidote kit consists of atropine which stops the 
paralyzing effects of nerve gas and pralidoxime chloride which 
helps return the bodys functions to normal 
harmon said soldiers carry three packs of the antidote each of 
which is effective for two to six hours depending on how soon the 
drugs are administered 
to help speed the delivery of the drugs they are contained in 
two separate springloaded injectors about the size of cigars the 
soldier pulls off the cap and presses the injector against his 
thigh the spring inside fires the hidden needle into his leg even 
through heavy protective clothing 
the autoejector device was invented by the companys founder 
the late stanley sarnoff who was a cardiologist at the national 
institutes of health sarnoff was looking for a way for people to 
easily administer lifesaving drugs including nerve gas antidote on 
the battlefield 
before the autoinjector the military used a needle attached to 
a small tube the soldier had to push the needle under his skin and 
squeeze the tube to administer the drug 
most syringes are rather imposing harmon said a lot of 
people have a real aversion to needles 
with the autoinjector as soon as you feel the pinch its 
over he said 
since 1975 the company has made more than 50 million doses of 
the nerve gas antidote and can make 15 million a month at full 
production the kits cost about 10 and have a shelf life of five 
years harmon said 
the plant generally produces several million doses a year it 
also has sold the antidote kits to other countries including 
canada jordan and israel

the persian gulf crisis could stir interest 
in compressed natural gas and some in the industry say continued 
high gasoline prices would make it easier to sell businesses on the 
technology 
companies that operate large fleets of cars or trucks are seen 
as the most likely consumers of cng but before they make a large 
investment in compatible vehicles theyll have to be convinced 
theyll save money 
we have to show them the longterm economic benefit not a 
shortterm benefit based on a disruption overseas said jack 
rigg spokesman for amoco oil co 
the main attraction of cng in recent years has been pollution 
control but the american gas association hopes the persian gulf 
crisis will open up a new market for natural gas 
we think the economic benefits will be there in the long run 
as well as environmental benefits and now energy security said 
george lawrence aga president another part of the agas pitch for 
cng is that 93 percent of the united states gas supplies currently 
come from domestic sources 
there are already 30000 vehicles in the united states running 
on natural gas most of them are in company fleets where the gas is 
compressed at the motor pool 
amoco last week opened a cng pump at one of its stations in 
denver but access to cng remains the main obstacle to widespread 
use 
for now the economic benefits of cng are apparent the cng 
equivalent of a gallon of gasoline costs about 70 cents the aga 
said unleaded selfserve regular gasoline averaged 1237 a gallon 
monday according to the american automobile association the 
average price has risen 162 cents since iraq invaded kuwait aug 
2 the aaa said 
general motors corp announced july 24 that it would begin 
production early next year of at least 1000 lightduty trucks that 
would run on natural gas and be available for utility and private 
fleet use in california and texas 
any time you see gas prices go up you start to look for 
alternatives this is definitely an alternative said thomas 
klipstine a spokesman for gms truck division 
a price for the vehicles hasnt been determined but the company 
says they will be competitively priced amoco says it costs about 
2000 to convert a vehicle to accept both cng and gasoline 
although texas land commissioner garry mauro commended gm for 
taking a step toward meeting alternative fuel demands for the 
1990s klipstine said the driving force behind gms involvement was 
the environment 
in terms of saying it is an alternative fuel that depends on 
what happens who knows at this point klipstine said from an 
efficiency economical and availability standpoint gasoline is 
still the best thing going when one of those things change the 
interest in an alternative fuel peaks 
in oklahoma oneok inc a gas company has had its cng program 
in place for about eight years among its clientele are the tulsa 
public schools buses and a fleet of cars used by the states motor 
pool division in oklahoma 
chuck callahan oneoks manager of commercial marketing 
believes iraqs invasion of kuwait has raised the interest level of 
fleet operators considering conversion to cng 
it certainly improves the economic benefits also callahan 
said every time the price of gas goes up a dime it makes 
conversion look that much better 
another of the drawbacks to cng is its shorter range about 150 
miles per tank cng vehicles also carry heavier tanks although 
energy companies are exploring remedies 
in tulsa county officials are talking about converting 25 of 
their 294 county vehicles the conversion will cost about 40000 
which would be paid by a loan from the oklahoma alternative fuels 
conversion fund 
tulsa county clerk joan hastings says converting 25 vehicles 
would save about 15000 a year in the difference between cng and 
gasoline

the power outage that darkened parts of wall 
street for a week has revived a debate that gains force with 
electronic trading high real estate costs and gripes about the 
citys infrastructure and transportation 
does the nations financial market need to be based in new york 
some wall street executives angered by delays in restoring 
power that caused potential losses in the millions said new york 
is on the verge of an exodus by financial firms that logistically 
could operate just about anywhere 
everyone on the street is just waiting for one of the major 
houses to pull the plug said daniel schwartz managing director 
of ulmer brothers inc a small investment banking firm that 
operated out of schwartzs brooklyn brownstone house until 
regaining power monday 
if that happens i think you would see a domino effect he 
said 
others said dealmakers and stock traders need the centralized 
nature of the financial markets and new yorks constant hum 
i dont expect its going to happen for another 25 years 
michael mendelson president of fahenstock amp co a wall street 
firm founded in 1881 said of a major power outage this is still 
the most practical place to be 
consolidated edison co of new york said power was back monday 
at all 1600 customers in a 30block area knocked out aug 13 the 
outage initially included some major wall street firms the 
american stock exchange and the world trade center 
power was restored to many buildings the same day while others 
remained out all week 
firms that worked on backup generators and at the offices of 
friendly competitors criticized the citys utility for decisions 
such as restoring power to the fulton fish market before the 
federal reserve bank of new york 
they restored power to the fish market before the central 
bank said one executive who asked not to be named that gives 
you a reading on the citys priorities 
wall street executives said at least one major institution was 
intensifying relocation plans in the blackouts aftermath others 
reviewed emergency plans several said the problems dealing with 
con edison reflected badly on the citys concern about the 
financial markets 
con ed spokesman martin gitten said you do the best you can 
and you meet the needs as they are available with the equipment and 
people you have the matter was handled in the best way we could at 
the time 
the two biggest firms in the area out for the week nomura 
securities international inc and prudentialbache securities inc 
said they resumed full operations monday after running on backup 
power 
the fed successfully returned its electronicpayments system to 
lower manhattan after switching to an alternate computer center in 
in pearl river north of the city last thursday 
the move which occurred after two of three backup generators 
failed slowed banking transactions and government securities 
trading and led the fed to consider declaring a bank holiday that 
would have stalled 900 billion in transactions daily 
wall street and its environs have been the central location for 
the banking and securities industries since stock trading began in 
1792 the first major firm didnt move from the area until 1969 
when smith barney relocated in midtown manhattan more recently 
though many firms have shifted some operations to brooklyn and new 
jersey 
others are deciding whether to leave new york entirely morgan 
stanley amp co is discussing options for when leases expire in 1998 
and that includes the city that includes outside the city a 
spokeswoman said 
the reasons for being in a central location are a historical 
anachronism said junius w peake a securities industry 
consultant over time as you get away from trading systems that 
are people intensive geography becomes less important 
despite the outage the citys crowded highways maligned 
subways and high office costs many executives said the benefits of 
doing business in new york still outweigh the ills meeting and 
servicing clients recruiting employees proximity to the new york 
stock exchange all favor the city 
its also a quality of life issue said creighton peet 
administrative partner with the investment firm cowen amp co a lot 
of people like living in new york 
theres a closeness between the different parts of the trading 
community its important to their businsess to interact directly 
that aspect would be hard to replace if you moved people all over 
to remote spots he said

when lukasz malachowski edited an influential 
weekly back home in poland the bottom line was maintaining 
journalistic integrity while avoiding the ire of communist 
government censors 
came the revolution and all that changed the censors were gone 
but so were the government subsidies for essentials like paper and 
ink competing for survival became the new bottom line 
everything was subsidized or donated we never had to think 
whether it could be sold or not now we have to think over all 
these things or nobody will be able to survive says malachowski 
35 whose catholic weekly review essentially went broke with the 
change to a market economy 
this summer malachowski is one of 15 eastern european 
journalists spending 10 weeks at american magazine like elle 
rolling stone business week family circle and esquire in an 
internship program sponsored by the us government and the 
magazines 
the interns seasoned journalists in their mid30s from 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and 
romania have come to the united states to learn how a free and 
competitive press works 
they have to learn to operate a magazine as a business says 
anne sutherland fuchs senior vice president and publisher of elle 
who organized the magazine industrys role in the internship 
program 
they havent been faced with circulation decisions 
subscriptionpricing decisions advertising rates everything 
has been dictated whether its the kind of paper they print on or 
how many copies they print she says 
its a whole different ballgame when its a free press 
sitting in his cubicle at elle magazine peter janos sos 41 
leafed through a copy of kepes 7 illustrated week in english the 
hungarian family weekly of which he is deputy editor in chief the 
first advertisement in the 60page magazine appeared on page 30 it 
promoted paving stones 
then he pulled an issue of elle toward him and turned the glossy 
pages filled with ads enticing the reader to buy expensive 
cosmetics designer clothing glamorous perfumes and chic 
accessories 
at first i thought the quality of advertisements is not the 
job of the editor but the job of the advertiser says sos a 
burly man who chooses his english words carefully i talked about 
it with anne fuchs and she said i would never take the 
advertisement of x here on the first pages because its not 
beautiful enough 
the eastern european journalists admire the sleek look of their 
host publications their advertising knowhow and technical 
expertise above all they admire the huge sums of money that go 
into making the magazines they are also fiercely proud of their 
magazines at home but this pride goes hand in hand with a deep 
frustration about their financial and technical limitations 
gyorgyi kocsis 36 an intern at business week helped found a 
weekly economic magazine 12 years ago in budapest hungary that 
broke new ground in uptodate critical reporting at a time when 
most publications were mouthpieces for the government 
hvg the hungarian initials for world economy weekly became a 
very popular quality magazine in hungary says ms kocsis but in 
the last two years she adds as new newspapers and magazines hit 
the market it lost 15 percent of its readership and suffered an 
identity crisis 
she pointed on her cluttered desk at business week to a recent 
issue of her magazine the cover shows pieces of paper representing 
stock shares coming out of factory chimneys the illustration is in 
black and white and the paper on which it is printed is rough 
some of our ideas on the cover gags pictures can be on any 
world magazine but i have to look with a looking glass because the 
printing is so awful says ms kocsis hvgs look suffers badly 
in comparison to all the beautiful magazines on the newsstand 
here 
suddenly unable to contain her frustration she gestures toward 
her magazine and exclaims now i hate it 
but as the eastern european magazines get slicker and fatter 
with advertisements and censorship becomes a thing of the past 
even journalists who are ardent supporters of a freemarket economy 
feel a bittersweet twinge as their old world collapses 
the family business atmosphere at hvg probably will 
disappear ms kocsis says wistfully 
probably it will be more professional and big and sort of 
westernized we will lose this feeling we are going to be news 
factory which can be good and useful and profiting but probably 
we will lose this friendly atmosphere i think but we have to grow 
up 
malachowski an intern at family circle recently lost his job 
as a top editor at the catholic weekly review in warsaw poland as 
the only independent newspaper tolerated by the communist party 
its coverage of politics and social issues was very influential he 
says 
today the catholic church trying to cope in a freemarket 
economy and pay its bills has let the weekly become a slim 
pamphlet on religious affairs malachowski says 
we always treated our press as a sort of art piece and now we 
must start to think about this as a sort of product says 
malachowski whose wirerimmed glasses and tweed jacket reinforce 
his professorial air 
anyway he adds people arent as interested in art any more 
poetry he notes thrived in the 1960s and 1970s in poland when 
government censorship was extremely strict 
the problem is that today you have no censorship but much 
less people are interested in poetry he says a new generation 
thinks about commercial things about houses cars about normal 
things as they are in the whole western world 
the condition of the economy in poland gives us an absolutely 
new situation says malachowski the press is financially 
bankrupt it is difficult to survive with magazines and papers we 
need to see the average american paper or magazine to find out how 
it works 
american knowhow goes a long way but it doesnt translate 
directly into hard currency the survival of eastern european 
magazines and newspapers also depends on western companies 
investing capital in them hvg kepes 7 and mlady svet the largest 
weekly in czechoslovakia all have made deals with foreign 
companies or are close to doing so 
mlady svet the young word in english takes three weeks to 
produce complains marek hlavica 28 an editor at the weekly he 
also is a singer and harmonica player and is spending his 
internship at rolling stone magazine 
if his magazine founded by the youth group of the communist 
party is to stay ahead of its growing pack of competitors he 
says it needs an infusion of money from foreign investors to 
upgrade its technical capabilities 
the magazine is one stone in the mosaic of the whole society 
and it must change with those things politics society and so 
on hlavica says 
but we are optimists weve got a good starting position 
thats very important weve got tradition good tradition weve 
got good writers weve got opportunity to cooperate with foreign 
companies so we are optimists why not

commercial airlines have yet to feel the pinch 
of a diversion of jets for the military airlift to saudi arabia 
but an industry official says service could be disrupted under a 
prolonged airlift 
were operating routinely don morrison of trans world 
airlines said monday three days after the pentagon activated the 
civil reserve fleet 
on friday the pentagon mobilized 38 of the 508 commercial jets 
available for diversion about 20 large jets from the 16 airlines 
under the program are being used each day according to the 
military airlift command 
airline officials say they are under pentagon instructions not 
to disclose details of their participation 
pan am said monday it has had to cancel a small number of 
flights and put smaller planes on others but spokesman jeff 
kriendler said the impact has been minimal 
northwest airlines spokesman bob gibbons would not rule out the 
possibility of future disruptions but said that as of monday 
afternoon there had been no disruptions in the carriers regular 
passenger flights 
a lot depends on when they call for the airplanes he said 
tim neale air transport association spokesman said most 
airlines have a minimal number of planes in reserve and the 
military callup could reduce their options in case mechanical 
failure takes an airliner out of service 
cargo carriers are in a relatively slow season now neale said 
but could feel the pinch if the emergency fleet is still being used 
during the christmas season 
further forced usage of commercial jets would require an order 
from the defense secretary who could commandeer up to 506 
airliners for use on 48 hours notice 
this is the first time the civil reserve air fleet has been used 
since it was set up in 1952 during a period of bombshelter 
building and heightened concern over military readiness 
the initial order came from the military transportation command 
at scott air force base in illinois and requires planes to be used 
on military flights on 24 hours notice 
the planes remain available for commercial flights when they are 
not being used by the military 
carriers are paid for all flights under military contracts which 
require them to commit set numbers of aircraft and crews in times 
of crisis 
the airlines maintain operational control of their airplanes 
we just make them a deal they cant refuse said airlift command 
spokesman lt col mike cox 
airlines are paid for the mandatory military charters at rates 
set under their regular military contracts which include 
reimbursement for extra insurance costs and the cost of keeping the 
planes ready for such a callup 
the commitment to join the fleet is part of their obligation 
under lucrative military contracts that are a significant source of 
revenue for some airlines during peacetime 
cox said 20 or more dc10 dc8 l1011 and boeing 747 jetliners 
were being used each day since the fleet was activated 
the order to activate the civilian fleet came one day after 
transportation secretary samuel skinner had told authorities he 
thought it would be unnecessary transportation department 
officials said skinner was not involved in the military decision 
the military said it had tried for several days to conduct the 
massive airlift by calling upon airlines individually to charter 
planes but found it couldnt muster enough planes for the rapid 
troop deployment

the bush administration likely wont get its 
wish for lower interest rates because of the federal reserves 
concern over increased inflationary pressures stemming partly from 
the persian gulf crisis economic analysts believe 
these analysts forecast that shortterm interest rates such as 
banks benchmark prime lending rate will remain unchanged in coming 
weeks at 10 percent longterm rates such as 30year home 
mortgages will come under increasing upward pressure the analysts 
say 
that gloomy assessment of interest rate prospects was being made 
as fed policymakers convene today in washington for a meeting of 
the federal open market committee the panel headed by fed 
chairman alan greenspan is responsible for setting the central 
banks interest rate policies 
while the results of the closeddoor deliberations will not be 
disclosed until oct 5 many analysts expected the meeting to 
produce no change in the feds current tight money policies despite 
pleas from the administration for a looser credit stance to keep 
the country out of a recession 
the central bank is trapped with the situation in the middle 
east limiting the feds options considerably said allen sinai 
chief economist of the boston co ultimately a recession will 
bring forth some credit easing on the part of the fed but there is 
simply too much inflation in the system for the fed to ease at this 
point 
in normal times with the economy close to a recession the fed 
would be expected to loosen its grip on the money supply and allow 
interest rates to fall as a way of stimulating economic growth to 
avert a downturn or at least lessen its severity 
but analysts said that this time around in part because of the 
mideast crisis inflationary pressures are rising at the same time 
that economic growth is slowing 
even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait caused oil prices 
to shoot up by about 8 per barrel there were signs of growing 
inflationary pressures the government last week reported that 
consumer prices climbed a brisk 04 percent in july and for the 
entire year have been rising at a worrisome annual rate of 58 
percent 
any sign that the fed was giving up the fight against inflation 
could make investors more skittish and send interest rates even 
higher analysts believe 
fed policy makers would like to ease but they are hamstrung 
said lawrence chimerine a senior fellow at the economic strategy 
institute a washington research organization they will not be 
able to act until both the oil market and the bond market 
stabilize 
that forecast will not bring cheer at the white house where the 
administration has been unrelenting in its pressure on the fed to 
lower interest rates to stave off a downturn 
last week treasury secretary nicholas brady said that rising 
oil prices resulting from the mideast crisis likely would cut 
already sluggish economic growth in half for the rest of the year 
he predicted the economy as measured by the gross national 
product would grow at a barely discernible 075 percent rate for 
the rest of the year if oil prices remain near current levels that 
would be down from an already anemic 15 percent gnp growth rate in 
the first half of the year 
many private analysts are even more pessimistic forecasting 
that a recession defined as a contracting gnp is very likely to 
begin probably in the final three months of this year 
this economy is headed for a recession unless the middle east 
calms down in a hurry said david wyss senior financial analyst 
at drimcgraw hill 
wyss said that because of inflationary pressure the fed would 
not be able to push interest rates low enough to avert a downturn 
however he said he was looking for a slight easing move by the 
central bank perhaps as early as midseptember 
wyss predicted that the move when it comes likely would trim 
the federal funds rate the interest banks charge each other on 
overnight loans from a current level of 8 percent down to 775 
percent 
in addition to inflation another factor limiting the feds 
maneuvering room is recent weakness in the dollar which has been 
sliding on foreign exchange markets 
with interest rates rising in other countries the fed will be 
unable to significantly cut rates in the united states for fear of 
making it even harder for america to finance its budget and trade 
deficits with foreign capital economists said

toys r us and six other major distributors 
continue to sell unsafe imported toys despite warnings by the 
consumer product safety commission the government alleges in 
lawsuits aimed at halting the sales 
toys r us which operates 411 discount toy stores and the other 
companies were named in civil suits filed monday by the justice 
department and the cpsc 
the complaints charged that the companies sold baby rattles 
dolls stuffed animals and crib toys that either had small parts 
that could choke young children or contained excessive amounts of 
lead paint 
cpsc spokesman dan rumelt said most of the toys come from 
taiwan with the rest from hong kong china and south korea 
government officials said the two agencies knew of no deaths or 
injuries from the toys some of the items have been seized from 
store shelves and some others already sold have been recalled by 
distributors 
these cases emphasize the need for american companies to 
ensure that foreignmade toys are of the same legallyrequired 
standards as usmanufactured toys leslie southwick a deputy 
assistant attorney general said in a statement 
but a spokesman for one of the companies sued value merchants 
inc of milwaukee said the problem will not be solved until the 
customs service is given enough inspectors to check imported 
products 
mike mervis a spokesman for value merchants said the company 
had recalled all nine items cpsc cited as unsafe value merchants 
thought the toys met government standards but the product bought 
and the product that was shipped may have been different things 
he said 
mervis blamed inadequate inspection of foreign goods by the us 
customs service for the recurring problem 
there is no foolproof way to control this without much 
stronger federal intervention and some means of controlling the 
inspection process in factories overseas mervis said anything 
that gets through we then become responsible for regardless of our 
best efforts 
value merchants said it will continue to try to negotiate a 
resolution with the cpsc 
but toys r us headquartered in paramus nj indicated it 
would fight the suit filed against the company 
michael goldstein an executive vice president said the suit 
is without merit our safety record is excellent 
we believe we will prevail in the legal action and we believe 
its a waste of the taxpayers money said goldstein who was 
named as a defendant in the suit against the company 
also sued were child world inc of avon mass lionel leisure 
inc of philadelphia illco toy company usa inc of new york 
beachcombers international inc of fort meyers fla and division 
sales inc of itasca ill 
a woman who answered the telephone at lionel leisure a 
subsidiary of lionel corp declined to comment saying she was 
unaware of the lawsuit 
until we receive legal service as far as were concerned we 
havent been sued by anybody said the woman who refused to 
identify herself 
an official of division sales who also refused to identify 
himself declined to comment saying he didnt know anything 
about it

the states chief law officers complain that a 
lack of federal leadership is forcing them to launch their own 
investigations of possible price gouging by oil companies since the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the justice department has the stronger hand illinois 
attorney general neil f hartigan said monday at a special meeting 
of the national association of attorneys general wed like to 
get them to play it 
but he said the justice department suffers from political 
laryngitis and massive amnesia 
florida has subpoenaed 16 major oil companies to determine if 
oil prices were being fixed new york is issuing subpoenas to 
retail service stations charging particularly high prices and 
north carolina has taken exxon to court on suspicion of retroactive 
pricing pennsylvania is investigating possible price collusion 
the attorneys general from 24 states and representatives of 12 
other states met justice department and federal trade commission 
officials to press for action against oil companies found rigging 
prices since the invasion aug 2 
retail gasoline prices have jumped 20 cents to 30 cents a gallon 
in many parts of the country 
the attorneys general also issued a 15point plan that includes 
an appeal for the president and congress to set up a task force to 
examine the entire petroleum industry 
the plan urged the administration to assign highest priority to 
antitrust investigations to determine whether the current energy 
crisis is due to deliberate attempts to manipulate the market 
it also called upon the oil industry to exercise voluntary 
restraint and to be candid in their public statements about rising 
oil prices 
the attorneys general demanded effective federal legislation on 
pricegouging and creation of an energy scams task force to crack 
down on those who exploit consumers during periods of price 
instability 
president bush last week urged oil companies to hold down costs 
to consumers and several major companies temporarily froze or 
lowered prices 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday the 
administration was pleased with saudi arabias intention to boost 
its oil production in an effort to ward off shortages 
overall we believe we have reached a reasonably stable 
situation he said 
the attorneys general said their states were warning citizens 
about investment scams or comeons for lowcost heating devices 
new york attorney general robert abrams said a lot of people have 
had their life savings taken from them during past energy crises

auto industry labor negotiations intensify this 
week as two of the big three automakers plan to offer comprehensive 
contract proposals to the united auto workers union 
spokesmen for general motors corp and ford motor co said 
monday their companies would give the uaw their initial detailed 
contract proposals to replace agreements that expire sept 14 
lee sechler a spokesman for chrysler corp said he knew of no 
timing for such a proposal being offered by his company 
for the past month bargainers for the uaw and the big three 
have been meeting in subcommittees focused on specific contract 
issues results of those discussions will show up in the companies 
initial detailed proposals 
part of the uaws reaction to the suggested contracts will show 
up early next week when the union is expected to choose a target 
company for this years talks if things go according to the 
unions plan a contract reached with the target company will be a 
pattern for agreements at the other two companies 
gm vice president and chief negotiator alfred warren said his 
companys offer will be made late in the week a ford spokesman 
who declined to be identified said his companys was due thursday 
contracts covering more than 450000 active employees at the big 
three expire sept 14 
uaw president owen bieber is making the rounds this week 
meeting with toplevel company negotiators and reminding them there 
are less than four weeks remaining in the current agreements 
he visited with warren on monday and has sessions at ford on 
wednesday and chrysler on thursday 
i had hoped that they would have had a proposal out by this 
time bieber said monday morning after meeting with warren it 
hasnt been forthcoming i expect well see one in the next few 
days which ought to be one that is not a starter proposal 
later in the morning warren fulfilled that wish 
i think this week we will manage to put forth a proposal he 
said we have spent our time on putting together a whole set of 
options 
one of the things that the company has been looking at is the 
settlement a week ago today of a sixday strike at gms ac 
rochester west parts plant in flint that agreement ratified by a 
93 percent vote contains jobguarantee language for the plants 
employees for the next six years 
job security has been tapped as the top uaw priority in this set 
of negotiations 
make no mistake about it this company nor any other company 
can survive prosper move forward unless theyve got the good will 
of those workers behind them bieber said 
i think that situation there tells them how to get it they 
need it just as ford and chrysler need it he said 
warren agreed that the ratification margin was impressive 
i think the vote itself was encouraging and were certainly 
studying it he said one factor that comes out of it is the 
people were pleased with the settlement 
meantime the detroit news said in todays editions that 
bargaining between the uaw and chrysler is going slowly mainly 
because of companyproposed changes in healthcare coverage 
the company doesnt want to give nothing everythings a 
takeaway a uaw member who declined to be identified told the 
news another uaw source who also declined to be identified said 
bieber will find little progress has been made when he visits 
chrysler on thursday 
hes dropping by to get an update on where were at the 
second source said were probably going to report to him that 
were nowhere

the government abandoned 11 criminal probes 
against northrop corp in exchange for the companys guilty pleas 
in a defense fraud case according to secret documents unsealed by 
a federal judge 
the plea agreement was certainly no giveaway assistant us 
attorney william fahey said monday each of the investigations was 
conducted at least three years he said 
we determined that either the cases were beyond the statute of 
limitations or that we had determined there was insufficient 
evidence of criminal fraud he said 
the aerospace giant plead guilty in february to 34 counts of 
fraud involving the cruise missile and harrier jet contracts the 
company agreed to pay a 17 million fine one of the most 
substantial against a defense contractor 
the exhibits were unsealed monday by us district judge pamela 
ann rymer after a request by the los angeles times and wall street 
journal 
some of the criminal allegations that were dropped included 
mischarging in 1983 on production of a guidance component on 
the mx missile fahey said the statute of limitations passed in 
1988 
improper testing of a heat exchanger component in the mx 
pricing misconduct in a research report concerning the b2 
stealth bomber and mischarging by the b2 division 
failure to inform the government about a costsaving process

the jury that convicted three former pilots 
of flying a jetliner while under the influence of alcohol reasoned 
they were drunk because they didnt have the sense to heed a 
federal inspectors warning not to fly 
if they werent concerned about the passengers lives they 
should have at least been thinking about their own careers said 
jury forewoman ruth boylan 
the jury deliberated three days before finding the former 
northwest airlines pilots guilty monday in the first test of a 1986 
federal law aimed at cracking down on alcohol and drug use on 
commercial transportation 
the pilots flew a boeing 727 with 91 passengers from fargo 
nd to minneapolis after federal aviation administration 
inspector verle addison tipped off to their heavy drinking the 
night before met them at the fargo departure gate and warned them 
not to fly 
if they had heeded mr addisons warning and just said hey 
if theres questions well call northwest and get another cockpit 
crew boylan said none of them showed that judgment 
convicted of operating a jetliner while intoxicated were capt 
norman lyle prouse 51 of conyers ga 1st officer robert 
kirchner 36 of highland ranch colo and flight engineer joseph 
balzer 35 of antioch tenn 
the offense carries up to 15 years in prison and a 250000 
fine no sentencing date was set the defendants were freed without 
bail 
according to testimony the pilots went to a lounge the night 
before the early morning flight march 8 where balzer and kirchner 
shared six pitchers of beer prouse had 15 to 20 rum and diet cokes 
and fell on his way out of the bar according to testimony 
two hours after their arrest tests showed prouse with a 
bloodalcohol level of 013 percent balzer 008 percent and 
kirchner 006 percent the legal limit for driving in most states 
is 10 percent 
the 1986 law suggests that a person with a bloodalcohol content 
of 010 percent would be impaired but the law does not define 
drunkenness with a specific bloodalcohol level 
us district judge james rosenbaum told the jury it had to 
decide whether the pilots were so impaired that they lacked 
clearness of intellect and their usual control 
defense lawyers argued that the smoothness of the 40minute 
flight proved the pilots were not impaired and that prouse was an 
alcoholic with a high tolerance for alcohol but assistant us 
attorney elizabeth de la vega questioned whether they could have 
handled an emergency 
de la vega said she won despite the lack of trouble with the 
flight because as a matter of common sense people know that 
someone can be under the influence and not show it at all 
after the verdict many people including the prosecutor called 
for toughening the law de la vega suggested a limit of 004 
percent 
addison had testified he smelled alcohol on the pilots breath 
at the gate he said he wondered aloud if they had violated the faa 
rule against drinking within eight hours of a flight 
addison who had no authority to stop the flight warned prouse 
there would be no violation if the plane stayed where it was the 
plane left while addison was on the telephone seeking further 
instructions from a superior after the plane landed at 
minneapolis another faa official made a citizens arrest 
william mauzy kirchners lawyer said he would appeal peter 
wold attorney for prouse said he was considering an appeal bruce 
hanley attorney for balzer did not comment 
northwest fired the pilots for violating company policy by 
drinking within 12 hours of a flight and the faa revoked their 
licenses 
balzer said he will fight to regain his license its kind of 
hard to keep a good pilot on the ground he said thats kind 
of like asking picasso if he were going to paint again 
prouse said he is not hopeful of flying again i came in 
expecting the worst he said

grain and soybean futures prices opened lower 
this morning on the chicago board of trade 
the stock market opened with a huge plunge signaling possibly 
the onset of a recession which the grains view negatively said 
joel karlin an analyst with research department inc in chicago 
but even before the stocks started to plunge the board of trade 
markets were under pressure 
followthrough selling from mondays weak close undercut the 
opening of soybean trading 
and despite some concern about an early frost and too much rain 
in the midwest the weekly usda report late monday showed the corn 
and soybean crops both doing fairly well said karlin 
analysts say the lack of export demand also is weighing on the 
markets particularly wheat 
in early trading wheat futures prices were 1 cents lower to 
cent higher with the september contract at 279 a bushel corn 
was cent to cent lower with september at 252 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to cent lower with september at 116 a bushel 
and soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents lower with august at 608 
a bushel

kansas city power amp light co said 
tuesday it had extended its 857 million tender offer for kansas 
gas and electric co stock until sept 14 saying that about 43 
percent of kgampe shares had been tendered 
kansas city power said that about 137 million of kgampes 317 
million outstanding shares had been tendered as of the previous 
deadline of midnight monday 
kgampe based in wichita opposes the tender offer calling it 
illegal and inadequate the company has declined to call a special 
shareholders meeting requested by kansas city power 
the bid is the first hostile takeover attempt in the electric 
utility industry and some industry analysts believe it could have 
implications for other utilities 
kansas city power is seeking 90 percent of the kgampe stock for 
27 a share the offer began july 23 and represented a 37 percent 
premium over the market price of kgampe stock on the last trading day 
before the offer 
this confirms the strength of our offer there are just a 
lot of people saying this makes sense its just a stronger offer 
and people are saying its a strong offer kansas city power 
spokesman turner white said 
lyle koerper a kgampe spokesman said his company was not 
surprised by the extension of the tender offer or the number of 
shares tendered 
last week we said we would review all options to kcpls 
unprecedented action including remaining independent he said 
kgampe said last week it had asked its financial adviser to search 
out alternatives to the takeover bid industry experts have 
speculated that other utilities in the region might want to acquire 
the wichita company under terms more favorable to kgampe management 
and stockholders 
whatever the outcome of the tender offer some business experts 
say kcpl still has an uphill struggle to win regulatory approval 
for a takeover of kgampe

the state casino board today approved 
a financial bailout plan for developer donald trump staving off 
what his lawyers said last week could have been the collapse of his 
empire 
in a uninimous vote the casino control commission granted trump 
permission to use his three atlantic city gaming halls as 
collateral for a 65 million bank loan that is the center of the 
bailout 
trump attended the halfhour meeting staring straight ahead 
unsmiling and with his lips pursed even as the plan was approved 
this is a big hurdle and im happy trump told a throng of 
reporters and camera crews maybe you can focus on someone else 
now 
during hearings last week trumps attorneys told the commission 
that rejection of the plan or even a delay of more than a week or 
so could topple the first domino in the celebrity developers 
casino airline and real estate empire 
although the vote to approve was 50 commissioner w david 
waters said he was concerned because the commission had not looked 
into greater detail at trumps casino debt 
acting commission chairwoman valerie armstrong said trump would 
have to return sometime in october for a hearing on the overall 
financial stability of his casinos and other holdings 
i do not view this restructuring as the total solution to the 
problem armstrong said we must hold a full financial 
stability hearing as soon as possible 
the loan allowed trump to make an overdue 43 million bond 
payment in june on the trump castle casino 
earlier the state division of gaming enforcement had 
reluctantly endorsed the plan but criticized the debtheavy state 
of trumps casinos the division added provisos to the plan 
requiring that trump return three weeks from now with details of 
how he plans to make a 47 million bond payment due nov 15 on his 
new taj mahal casino resort 
trump is expected to return with a proposal to swap some of his 
32 billion in debt for equity sell assets perhaps the poorly 
performing trump shuttle airline or negotiate reduced or deferred 
interest rates 
ed tracy president of trumps three casinos and one noncasino 
hotel here said the commissions decision to postpone ruling on 
the matter until today did not cause problems with the banks 
claridge casino hotel president roger wagner said monday that

circle k corp has begun closing 201 stores 
targeted as unprofitable and will complete the job by the end of 
the month company spokesman ray cox said 
more closings are possible after the effects of the step are 
analyzed he said monday 
about 1600 employees in 21 states will be affected but 95 
percent of them will be moved to other stores cox said most of 
the stores are concentrated in texas california georgia and 
florida 
he would not say how much the closings were expected to save or 
how much it would cost to terminate the leases 
analysts said they doubted that 200 closings would suffice to 
pull the company from the protection of us bankruptcy court 
where it filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors may 15 
the company determined which stores to close mainly by gross 
sales and profitability figures cox said but other factors 
including traffic counts and neighborhood deterioration also were 
taken into account 
theyre probably closing all the leases they can get out of 
easily said dennis telzrow an analyst with eppler guerin amp 
turner in dallas 
circle ks latest move follows the recent termination of 400 
leases on stores that had been shut down those leases were 
estimated to cost the company 1 million to 15 million a month 
the company also had deals to sell 375 stores in hawaii and the 
pacific northwest before its chapter 11 filing the deals have been 
delayed pending court approval 
circle k operates about 4500 convenience stores in 32 states 
and has an additional 1300 licensed or jointventure stores in 14 
foreign countries 
other states where stores will be closed include arizona 
louisiana oklahoma colorado mississippi alabama new mexico 
north carolina oregon washington utah idaho tennessee 
kentucky missouri montana and south carolina

chinas economy is sluggish verging on 
recession but exports are booming 
foreign investment has lagged since the brutal crackdown on 
dissent more than a year ago businessmen still worry about 
political instability and are put off by numerous roadblocks to 
profitable joint ventures 
trade is the bright spot in the chinese economy a western 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity if the current trend 
keeps up this years may be the biggest trade surplus in chinas 
history 
total trade rose 86 percent in 1989 to 1115 billion from 
january through june this year the 2565 billion in exports 
exceeded imports by 256 billion economists predict a 10 billion 
surplus for 1990 nearly double the record 1982 surplus of 563 
billion 
more industries produce goods for export because economic 
problems have shrunk domestic markets economists say china also is 
pushing exports in order to repay foreign loans many of which are 
due in 1992 
led by its freewheeling southern coastal provinces china is 
exporting more to the united states than ever before despite 
international censure of the harsh action against prodemocracy 
demonstrators in june 1989 
exports to the united states rose 43 percent last year to 1199 
billion according to us commerce department figures president 
bushs decision in may of this year to continue mostfavorednation 
status eliminated a major threat to the growing trade 
japan has not cashed in on the boom even though it has moved 
faster than other industrialized nations to ease sanctions imposed 
on beijing after the army assault on tiananmen square 
chinas exports to japan fell 35 percent to 343 billion in 
the first half of 1990 and imports from japan plunged 399 percent 
to 322 billion total trade between the two fell 5 percent in 
1989 from the previous year 
japanese businessmen were discouraged by tiananmen said 
nobuo maruyama senior economist at the institute of developing 
economies in tokyo 
after more than a decade of investing in china and waiting he 
said the japanese are turning to other asian nations with cheap 
labor such as india indonesia and the philippines 
according to the western diplomat japanese businessmen arent 
terribly enthusiastic about china as a place to invest or to 
trade since exports have fallen due to import restrictions 
theyve become hardnosed about doing business here 
japanese investors express the same concerns about china as 
about the soviet union joint ventures can find little hard 
currency to buy imports and factories face shortages of electricity 
and raw materials despite recent orders that special help be given 
to foreignfinanced companies 
economic austerity measures china imposed in late 1988 to curb 
inflation caused the domestic market to shrink 
the pall cast by the military crackdown and fears of future 
instability further dampened foreign enthusiasm and investment in 
china fell 147 percent in 1989 to 185 billion according to 
chinese estimates 
late last year political and economic risk consultancy ltd of 
hong kong issued an evaluation for 1990 that pronounced china by 
far the riskiest for foreign investment of 10 asian nations 
including the coupprone philippines 
after pointing to corruption red tape and the potential for 
unrest it said 
only investors with a longterm view of profitmaking that 
takes into account huge potential short and mediumterm pitfalls 
should consider a large commitment of capital at this time 
investors willing to take the risk favor chinas southern and 
coastal provinces which have thousands of factories financed from 
nearby hong kong 
these areas have been incorporated into the world economy and 
technological and managerial innovation are seeping in the 
diplomat said 
five or six years ago guangdong had a bad problem with 
quality now its the preferred source for quality and ontime 
delivery even when wages are higher than in thailand 
japanese companies with a labor shortage at home increasingly 
use assembly plants along the chinese coast that require minimal 
investment and training said maruyama the tokyo economist 
smaller japanese firms making laborintensive lowcost items 
like tableware compact cameras pajamas and baby clothes are 
staying in business by producing in china he said longterm 
joint ventures are too risky they only want to use the labor 
power 
one investment bright spot comes from taiwan whose businessmen 
seek factory sites abroad because of rapidly rising costs and 
pollution concerns at home 
taiwanese invested an estimated 550 million in china last year 
replacing japan as the thirdranked foreign investor after hong 
kong and the united states 
beijing has established special investment zones with 
concessionary terms for taiwanese in fujian province across a 
narrow strait from the island and in guangdong

relationship with the state department helped provide an edge 
wang has worked closely with the us foreign affairs 
community for more than a decade said eugene shugoll vice 
president of wangs federal systems division 
while the contract will add to the companys revenue wang could 
use another major deal to show nervous customers that the state 
department contract was not a fluke said marc schulman an analyst 
with ubs phillips amp drew 
aside from the state department other foreign affairs agencies 
will be eligible to buy computers from wang under the contract 
announced tuesday they include the us agency for international 
development the us information agency and the foreign 
agricultural service of the us department of agriculture

mci communications corp said tuesday it was 
considering a writedown of 500 million to 550 million this 
quarter to cover the cost of replacing old analog equipment with 
digital gear 
the move came as the no 2 longdistance phone company announced 
plans to install a fully digital network by the end of next year at 
a cost of 11 billion 
the plan includes the integration of 3000 miles of optical 
fiber lines acquired when mci purchased telecom usa inc earlier 
this year it also includes an agreement with williams cos inc of 
tulsa okla for an interchange in each others phone systems 
terms of the williams deal were not disclosed 
both companies said the interchange agreement would allow them 
to save substantial amounts of capital investment over the next few 
years 
mci and telecom usa have been the second and fourth largest 
customers for williams fiberoptic phone system wiltel which 
sells access to its lines to longdistance companies 
the agreement will allow wiltel to serve a large number of 
cities using the mci network than it does now williams officials 
said 
digital phone systems transmit calls in computer language 
providing clearer reception and greater capacity than traditional 
analog systems 
mci earned 177 million in the second quarter on revenue of 
186 billion a writedown of assets could hurt earnings but mci 
did not speculate what that impact could be

venezuelas public foreign debt will 
cut by more than 20 percent under a reduction agreement reached 
between the country and creditor banks venezuelan officials 
announced tuesday 
the deal covers 205 billion of this oilproducing nations 26 
billion publicsector debt the country owes about 35 billion in 
public and private sector debt 
cutting the debt has been a major goal of the 19monthold 
government of president carlos andres perez he has said 
consistently that this oncewealthy nation is now too poor to pay 
on loans contracted over two decades of boom times 
debtcutting negotiations began early last year under the 
umbrella of us treasury secretary nicholas bradys plan to ease 
the burden of third world nations 
officials said more than 90 percent of a total 400 creditor 
banks have chosen from a list of five debtcutting options offered 
by venezuela 
the most popular options were the exchange of venezuelan debt 
for lowinterest 30year usguaranteed bonds and the loaning of 
fresh funds to venezuela 
least popular was the option that venezuela had pushed the 
hardest allowing venezuela to buy back debt on the secondary 
market at about 41 percent of its value 
although one option allows banks to recapture more funds if the 
price of oil rises officials said the income earned from high oil 
prices would far outweigh possible givebacks to the banks

ted turner is about to take his first step into 
the world of book publishing but not with the role of giant slayer 
this time 
turner publishing inc is getting started as a modest venture 
with little of the brashness that has accompanied other turner 
projects such as the launch 10 years ago of cable news network 
we dont have any intention of becoming a random house or 
simon amp schuster publishing is not the main business of tbs and 
it never will be said michael reagan vice president and 
publisher of turner publishing 
but reagan is hoping the publishing unit will cut itself a 
comfortable niche by utilizing turners cable television empire to 
generate interest in the book titles 
turner publishing a wholly owned subsidiary of turner 
broadcasting system inc puts its first book a coffeetable 
volume of reagans photographs on the market next month the book 
portrait of great britain and northern ireland is tied to a 
tbs miniseries 
most of what follows also will be tied to tbs television 
programming especially the companys vast movie library set for a 
valentines day release is kisses a photo collection of silver 
screen smooches ranging from clark gable and vivien leigh in gone 
withpside is that theres not a lot of expectations he 
said i dont think anyone expects us to make a profit right 
away 
but reagan added we have to prove ourselves financially 
as time goes by the burden will be on us to make a profit 
low expectations are probably a good thing considering the 
recent slump in some segments of the publishing industry 
several industry giants including simon amp schuster and harcourt 
brace jovanovich took writedowns in the past year competition for 
bestsellers has driven up the advances commanded by some 
wellknown writers some companies have taken on debt to buy other 
companies and have been forced to watch other costs more closely to 
meet repayment obligations 
analysts say turners relatively small investment in the book 
unit minimizes its risk 
its such a small part of the company said mary l 
kukowski who follows tbs for bear stearns amp co inc in new york 
a lot of what turner does is interesting but this is not 
important in terms of what moves the stock 
turner publishing evolved from the tbs chairmans creation of 
the turner tomorrow award in which a 500000 prize is offered for 
a novel that addresses positive solutions to global problems 
the award carries a promise to publish the winning manuscript 
and reagan said it became apparent wed need a publishing 
company 
reagan said the publishing venture was a natural given the tv 
material in the tbs archives with potential for transfer into book 
form as well as the companys existing marketing and promotion 
machinery 
if you spend 2 million doing miniseries or a documentary 
all that research is already being done its not much more money 
to add a book to that mix said reagan who is not related to the 
former president 
also ripe for mining are the 3700 movies turner owns mainly as 
a result of its 13 billion purchase of the mgm film library four 
years ago in addition to kisses a retrospective of outlaws 
rebels and rogues is planned as well as projects based on the 
film classics citizen kane and casablanca 
reagan said he expects the movieoriented books to have more 
mass appeal than those tied to the documentaries for example 
kisses a joint venture with citadel press will have a first 
printing of 50000 copies while portrait of great britain and 
northern ireland will ship 20000 
reagan who joined tbs in 1985 and worked on the portrait of 
america and portrait of the world series also has taken 
photographs for a book on cuba but once that volume is completed 
he said he will concentrate on his executive duties 
what were trying to do is break some ground on the idea of 
what a tiein is reagan said in the past publishers would 
take a screenplay and novelize it or slap a stars face on the 
cover this has nothing to do with a script its a tiein in the 
broadest possible sense

data general corp which has already cut its work 
force by about onethird may slash its payroll further to help end 
a string of losses analysts said tuesday 
employment at data general has shrunk to 11700 down from 
17700 in 1985 the last year the company reported a profit one of 
the biggest thorns for the company has been its line of midsize 
computers whose market has declined as smaller computers grow more 
powerful 
data general has been pushing a line of workstations which are 
powerful desktop machines to help reverse the companys slide 
its also been making products that conform to industry standards 
nonetheless data general is still struggling with weak 
revenues for the first nine months of the current fiscal year the 
company had revenues of 907 million compared with 957 million a 
year ago 
we are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to 
become profitable said james dunlap a spokesman for westboro 
massbased computer maker we are looking at all options that 
would allow us to cut costs we cannot rule out any possibility 
some wall street analysts said a round of layoffs could be 
announced soon and more than 1000 jobs might be eliminated 
there have been signals in the air that something major was 
coming said marc schulman an analyst at ubs phillips amp drew he 
defined a major cut as at least 1000 jobs 
most companies dont like to cut more than they have to 
said p martin ressinger an analyst with duff amp phelps i think 
data general might cut more than they have to in order to get the 
profits and not just break even 
analysts say data general has introduced potentially strong 
products particularly with its workstations but the company faces 
a tough task in carving out more of the market 
the company should concentrate first on becoming profitable and 
then turn its attention to attracting customers schulman said 
first they become profitable then people will start to 
evaluate their products he said

grain and soybean futures prices were weak 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade with wheat losing more than 
3 cents a bushel 
well need an influx of bullish news just to keep this market 
steady said joel karlin an analyst with research department 
inc in chicago 
the agricultural commodities withstood the buffeting of news 
from the middle east which sharply affected gold and oil prices 
however karlin said the sharp drop in stock prices at the 
markets opening was interpreted by grain traders as continuing 
evidence that a recession may be in the offing a negative 
influence on farm futures 
commodities also were under some pressure from a weekly 
government report issued late monday indicating the corn and 
soybean crops continue to be growing well in the midwest 
there was no help for prices on the demand side either said 
karlin 
theres no export demand for wheat and the situation may be 
the same for corn and soybeans in a few months he said 
at the close wheat futures prices were cent higher to 3 
cents lower with the contract for delivery in september at 277 a 
bushel corn was cent higher to 1 cents lower with september at 
251 a bushel oats were cent to cent lower with september at 
161 a bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 4 cents higher

iraqs invasion of kuwait has forced 
saudi arabia to make a fundamental and perhaps permanent change in 
its public approach to the outside world 
the invasion forced saudi arabia long equivocal about its links 
with the west to publicly ally itself with the united states 
despised by many arabs for its support of israel the united arab 
emirates and otherarate statements warned that the united states 
would be defeated and humiliated if it went to war against iraq 
fitzwater said iraqi officials have refused to give a us 
diplomat in baghdad access to americans and he added at this 
point we see very little to talk about when all we get are negative 
responses 
the white house also announced that defense secretary dick 
cheney returning from a trip through the tense middle east and 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will 
fly to maine wednesday to confer with bush at his oceanfront 
vacation home among the mattersfitzwater said bush will not sign 
before wednesday the order calling up reserves to fill in the ranks 
of doctors cargo handlers and other specialists depleted by the 
massive deployment of us troops to defend saudi arabia 
the number of reservists to be called was still unspecified one 
administration official said privately the order may be openended 
chief of staff john sununu said it will be a very surgical 
specialized callup 
fitzwater said 18 americans got out of kuwait tuesday but 
there are still 54 americans missing 13 in kuwait and 41 in 
iraq 
it does appear that citizens of all nations are being moved 
about in iraq to unknown destinations he said 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher said 
there were credible reports that iraq had forced some 
westerners to industrial installations and said an american in 
kuwait was seized in his home and interned in a hotel 
boucher said the reports had not been confirmed nor was it 
known whether americans were among those taken to plants 
saddam has threatened to use westerners as a human shield to 
dissuade the united states from attack more than 3000 americans 
are among more than 10000 foreigners trapped in iraq and kuwait 
the buildup of us forces continued in saudi arabia 
at the pentagon gen hansford t johnson the top official 
responsible for getting troops and supplies to saudi arabia said 
security rules prevented him from disclosing the exact number of 
ground troops there or on the way but that weve moved in 
essence the equivalent of a town the size of jefferson city mo 
preliminary 1990 census figures put jefferson citys population 
at 35408 
an additional 20000 or so sailors are deployed on warships in 
the area 
fitzwater spoke with reporters at the woodlands country club in 
falmouth maine while bush was out golfing at a tournament raising 
200000 for maine gov john mckernans reelection drive 
fitzwater stressed that it was not the united states alone but 
all nations that were demanding iraq to end its occupation of 
kuwait 
we demand complete and unconditional withdrawal from kuwait 
that is the position of the united nations and thats the position 
of all nations the spokesman said 
im sure all nations are interested in the welfare of their 
citizens interested in talking to iraq at any point thats not 
the same as negotiations over a un demand to get out he said 
fitzwater said joseph wilson the us charge daffaires in 
baghdad met with iraqi officials monday demanding access to 
americans his plea was spurned 
asked if there could be no talks with iraq until its tanks are 
out of kuwait fitzwater replied the important point here is 
that the world is united in demanding that iraq withdraw from 
kuwait that has not changed one iota by these comments this 
morning 
bush back from a day of speeches in which he termed the 
foreigners in iraq and kuwait hostages and attacked saddam as a 
man of evil standing against human life itself ignored reporters 
tuesday saying nothing to them during on an early morning jog and 
on the golf course 
bush spoke by telephone tuesday to thomas pickering the us 
ambassador to the united nations and to national security adviser 
brent scowcroft who was back at the white house 
fitzwater said us warships were still shadowing several ships 
in the persian gulf region to make sure none violated the trade 
embargo with iraq however he said one iraqi tanker was being 
allowed to dock in a yemen port based on assurances from the yemeni 
government that that country would not unload or use iraqi oil 
sununu also out golfing in mckernans tournament defended 
bushs decision to stay in maine in spite of the crisis 
everybody knows he keeps in touch with whats happening 
said sununu id rather have a president who kept the whole thing 
in perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and 
brooded about the problem 
the president later was attending the funeral of his uncle dr 
john walker 81 a retired surgeon and investment banker from 
easton maine who died thursday

a leading official of the european 
community on tuesday urged finance officials of the united states 
and other key industrialized nations to meet soon to discuss the 
persian gulf crisis 
jacques delors president of the european commission said the 
officials should meet to give positive signs to the jittery 
financial markets 
there have been increasing fears that skyrocketing oil prices 
caused by the international embargo against iraqi and kuwaiti 
crude will tip the united states and maybe other western nations 
into a recession 
delors a former french finance chief said the mideast crisis 
required more coordination of the economic policies of the group of 
seven countries the united states britain france canada 
japan italy and west germany 
those nations top finance officials meet periodically to assess 
the world economic outlook and monitor their own economic and 
monetary performance 
delors acknowledged he had no say in scheduling the highlevel 
talks comparing his suggestion to a bottle sent out to sea

conflicting reports about the prospects for stability in the middle 
east 
gold prices slipped after rising sharply in europe on the new

off 270 an ounce from monday later republic national bank 
quoted an afterhours bid of 40690 down 235 as of 4 pm edt 
traders sold the dollar following a report that iraqi president 
saddam hussein was willing to negotiate a peace settlement but 
later reports that the iraqis were mining kuwaiti ports and 
refineries pushed the dollar higher 
the dollar and gold got whipsawed by these conflicting 
reports said marc chandler an analyst with mms international in 
chicago the dollar put in its lows on the idea that there would 
be peace then when that seemed to fade it was pushed back up 
in times of international turmoil the dollar is in demand 
because it is perceived as a safehaven currency

already weak us currency the government reported that the 
federal budget deficit jumped 259 billion in july pushing the 
fiscal years imbalance so far to 1891 billion compared with 
1237 billion at the end of july 1989 
the report induced traders to sell dollars because it appears 
the us economy may be headed into a recession lower interest 
rates which typically follow in an economic slowdown would make 
dollardenominated securities less appealing to foreign investors 
still investors are a little afraid to get a little too short 
of dollars said gilbert cisneros a trader at the bank of 
bostons new york office if something does spark in the middle 
east its expensive to get the dollars back

ibm on tuesday announced two new lowerpriced 
models of its popular midrange application system400 computer 
line as well as software enhancements designed to improve the 
computers performance 
the cheapest of the new models is priced at 18250 27 percent 
below the previous lowestcost as400 international business 
machines corp said 
ibm says this means small companies or departments of large 
corporations can now afford an as400 computer 
ibm also announced a new model of its application systementry 
line a lowerpriced computer line this new model which will be 
priced at 11000 could later be upgraded to an as400 machine 
ibm said 
in addition ibm announced more than 200 hardware and software 
enhancements for the entire as400 line they include a new version 
of the as400s operating system the base layer of software that 
controls internal computer functions as well as new data storage 
devices 
ibm said it intends to announce new highend extensions of the 
2yearold as400 line by mid1991 that will increase performance 
and capacity 
bob djurdjevic an industry analyst and president of annex 
research in phoenix said the new lowend as400 models should help 
increase the market share for the line 
but he said more significant news was buried in ibms 
announcement the fact that it will license independent software 
houses to use the internal code of the operating system of the 
as400 computers to develop new applications programs previously 
ibm regarded this operating system code as proprietary djurdjevic 
said 
he said the move shows ibm is responding to the move by the 
computer industry toward open or nonproprietary operating 
systems 
the fact that the as400 is now becoming a more open system 
will undoubtedly aid it in its competition for software developers 
hearts and minds he said in a report on ibms announcement 
there already are about 8000 applications programs for the 
as400 line he said

straight record high on tuesday but the price of crude oil fell as 
traders reacted to what appeared to be more conciliatory rhetoric 
from iraq

there was another possible solution to the situation other than 
military

no plans to seek a deal while iraqi forces remained in kuwait

fifthstraight day to 1013 up 101 cents from monday 
concerns about shortages have some consumers keeping their tanks 
full and some service stations keeping their supplies at higher 
levels said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson 
lehman brothers inc 
theyre anticipating shortages down the line hittle said 
traders have been concerned of a lack of refinery capacity with 
us plants running at nearly full capacity and three modern 
kuwaiti refineries taken out of the world market by the 
international boycott of oil from iraq and kuwait

from 1417 to 1420 per 1000 cubic feet on september contracts 
and wholesale home heating oil rose 75 cent to 8371 cents per 
gallon tuesday was the last trading day for september petroleum

warwary traders sent gold futures prices into a strong rally 
then a sharp reversal as middle east developments sent conflicting 
signals tuesday to the trading pits at the commodity exchange in

on other markets petroleum futures were mostly higher orange 
juice was sharply lower grain and soybeans were mostly lower and 
cattle was mostly higher while pork declined 
the gold market was a pretty volatile session said craig 
sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york traders are nervous if you happen to be long in gold 
youve got a lot to lose if things calm down in the middle east 
even before trading began for the day the market was looking 
for higher prices on a rumor that a us plane had been shot down 
in the mideast the prices held firm even after the rumor was 
denied 
but when saddam husseim made an address to president bush and 
iraqs defense minister tariq aziz called for a negotiated 
settlement the gains in gold futures gave way dropping 15 below 
the days high 
perhaps the market was expecting or fearing a declaration of 
war or whatever sloane said 
the losses were trimmed before the close as the market came to 
realize that iraqs statements broke no new ground 
it doesnt take much to get the market moving in any 
direction said sloane 
gold futures settled 270 to 290 lower with the august 
contract at 40740 a troy ounce silver was 34 cents to 41 cents 
lower with september at 5105 a troy ounce

195 cents to 415 cents with september settling at 16675 a pound 
cattle futures were mostly higher while the pork complex 
declined on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle regained losses suffered monday when many traders 
interpreted a usda cattleonfeed report as bearish said tom 
morgan president of sterling research corp of arlington heights 
ill 
that interpretation was shown to be mistaken he said when 
tuesdays cash markets were strong 
in pork theres an overall bearish situation he said 
were going to see the slaughter increase more than seasonally as 
we move into the late summer and fall 
live cattle settled 30 cent lower to 53 cent higher with the

soybean trading on the chicago board of trade

crisis 
the two countries want opec to allow members to raise production 
to make up for 4 million barrels of crude kept off the market each 
day because of the international boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti oil 
world crude prices have risen significantly since iraq invaded its 
neighbor on aug 2 
saudi arabia plans no unilateral oil production increase to make 
up the fall in global supply according to the saudi ambassador to 
algeria 
but saudi arabia continues to consult with other opec members 
about raising oil production mohamed hassan faki told reporters 
monday evening 
an eventual increase in oil prices would have a disastrous 
effect on the world economy faki said saudi arabia had 
indicated over the weekend it would increase production by up to 2 
million barrels of oil per day even without approval from opec

us financial markets took a rollercoaster ride tuesday as 
traders reacted fitfully to sometimes belligerent sometimes 
conciliatory talk from iraq 
the stock market ended the day sharply lower oil prices fell 
bonds were nearly unchanged and gold prices slipped but the 
markets were characterized by wild ups and downs throughout the day 
comments on the middle east are just whacking the market this 
way and that said robert brusca chief economist with nikko 
securities international inc 
financial markets focused on televised statements from iraq by 
the nations defense minister and its president saddam hussein 
who again escalated the level of rhetoric in the persian gulf 
standoff 
the market was heartened when iraqi defense minister tariq aziz 
said in jordan the country was willing to negotiate a settlement to 
the crisis but he did not offer to withdraw iraqi troops from 
kuwait and restore the monarchy 
hussein later offered more harsh words for president bush and 
the united states predicting a major catastrophe if 
hostilities break out and a bloody conflict that america will 
lose iraq also was reported to be mining kuwaiti ports and 
refineries 
the war words rattled wall street which has taken a beating 
because of concerns over the us economys poor performance in 
recent months the dow jones industrial average fell 5248 to close 
at 260396 earlier the dow average was down by as much as 77 
points 
crude oil prices slipped after azizs settlement comment but 
inched back up when the white house said it had no plans to strike 
a deal while iraqi forces continued to occupy neighboring kuwait 
the price closed witha 15cent loss on the new york mercantile 
exchange at 2841 a barrel 
when hussein comes out and says lets talk people take some 
profits and stay on the sidelines and say lets see what he wants 
to talk about said jack odea manager of international energy 
futures for dean witter reynolds inc 
among refined petroleum products unleaded gasoline closed at a 
record high for the fifth straight day at 1013 per gallon up 
101 cents natural gas rose 03 cent to 1420 per 1000 cubic 
feet and home heating oil rose 75 cent to 8371 cents per gallon 
the dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies in a 
volatile session also buffeted by the conflicting comments from 
iraq gold prices slipped after rising sharply in europe gold 
prices closed at 40740 off 270 an ounce from monday 
after falling sharply amid fears of oilbacked inflation bond 
price gained ground to close nearly unchanged the treasurys key 
30year bond fell 63 cents per 1000 face amount after losing more 
than 5 in morning trading before rebounding sharply 
yields on the long bond cracked 9 percent during the day before 
falling back later 
with all the different comments you just dont really know 
what the heck to do brusca said the markets seemed willing to 
seize upon a seed of good news 
overseas financial markets were battered by an unconfirmed 
report later denied by the state department that a us plane was 
shot down over iraq the frankfurt stock market tumbled 5 percent 
while prices closed sharply lower in london and tokyo

automaker renault as jj international automotive corp the us 
company said tuesday

sportutility vehicle the company wants to make and market there 
have been rumors that chrysler may decide to build the vehicle by 
itself or may be looking for a partner to replace renault

its toledo ohio jeep plant as a kit with major assemblies such 
as body panels interiors and powertrains being made by suppliers 
that would cut chryslers investment in the vehicle

stardent computer inc shareholders voted 
tuesday to strengthen the companys relationship with kubota 
computer of japan and oust two board members who sued the japanese 
firm 
the removal of allen michels and matthew sanders iii from the 
stardent board of directors followed their dismissal last month as 
cochairmen of the company which makes graphics computers 
stardent was formed last year through the merger of stellar 
computer inc based in newton and ardent computer corp of 
sunnyvale calif 
prior to the merger kubota owned 44 percent of ardent and now 
owns 22 percent of the combined companies 
but in july michels and sanders who were the founders of 
ardent filed a lawsuit claiming that kubota forced the merger in 
order to weaken ardent and eventually gain its technology 
after the suit was filed the stardent board of directors 
removed michels and sanders as cochairmen on tuesday 
shareholders voted to remove the two men from the board entirely 
the company said the action was taken because sanders and 
michels were no longer officers or employees of the company 
roxanne frisiello a stardent spokeswoman insisted that the 
removal of the two men as cochairmen had nothing to do with the 
lawsuit instead it was due to differences in management style 
and the relocation of sunnyvale offices to newton which eliminated 
the need for their positions 
under terms of the agreements approved by stockholders kubota 
will invest up to 60 million in stardent over the next 12 months 
raising kubotas total stake in the company to 28 percent 
in return stardent has granted certain technology and 
distribution rights and licenses to a kubota subsidiary in san 
jose calif 
kubota abstained from the voting frisiello said

the chicago board of trade said tuesday it is 
keeping an eye on soybean oil futures purchases amid reports that a 
unit of grainprocessing giant archer daniels midland is trying to 
corner the market 
market cornering is considered an unfair trading practice in 
which one company controls so much of a commodity it can wield an 
enormous influence over the price to the disadvantage of other 
traders 
the actions by the chicago board of trade one of the worlds 
leading commodities exchanges involves adm investor services an 
arm of adm the action comes about a year after the exchange issued 
an emergency order to break up a similar suspected attempt by an 
italian firm 
the commodity futures trading commission the federal agency 
that regulates the futures industry also said it was monitoring 
the market closely 
at adm headquarters in decatur ill aides said the firm had no 
comment 
adm is believed to hold more than half of all contracts for july 
and august delivery of soybean oil the wall street journal 
reported tuesday 
board of trade spokesman michael oakes said a considerable 
amount of bean oil has been purchased by adm 
im sure its being handled by our business conduct committee 
that they are looking into it oakes said 
until it reaches a point where we feel its a threat we just 
watch and monitor he said 
the board of trade determined there was a similar threat in july 
1989 when it appeared that ferruzzi spa one of the worlds 
largest soybean processors was trying to corner the soybean market 
ferruzzi had acquired large positions in the soybean market and 
owned more than fourfifths of all soybeans available for immediate 
delivery exchange officials and regulators concluded 
to keep ferruzzi from gaining control over soybean prices the 
cftc ordered the firm to reduce its holdings by 20 million bushels 
the board of trade then issued an emergency order requiring the 
liquidation of large positions in its july soybean contract 
that touched off wild swings in bean prices and prompted sharp 
criticism by farm groups and traders who saw the value of their 
futures holdings plummet

a state panel this month will consider 
restricting overthecounter sales of robitussindm and other cough 
remedies because they apparently have found a niche among teenage 
drug abusers officials said tuesday 
in one case last winter police in the pennsylvania community of 
waynesboro discovered dozens of discarded cough medicine bottles at 
a park frequented by teens an officer in the town of williamsport 
said a local boy reportedly suffered kidney problems because of his 
longterm abuse of cough syrups 
the fact is they are using the substance to get high said 
gerald keenan a physicians assistant in waynesboro who has 
identified cases involving cough medicine abuse 
we could not believe at the time we saw this that the level of 
intoxication was caused by cough syrup we thought it was 
caused by alcohol or something else he said 
a group of pharmacists from southcentral pennsylvania has asked 
the state department of health to pull robitussin and other cough 
medicines containing dextromethorphan from store shelves placing 
it under the control of pharmacists 
if the request is approved medicines containing 
dextromethorphan the most effective cough treatment on the market 
could be purchased only by people 18 and older consumers would 
have to sign a form to buy the products and would be permitted to 
purchase only 4 ounces within 72 hours 
the department needs to address it in some manner said jack 
ogun administrative secretary of the state drug device and 
cosmetic board 
the change would take it off display which would be the 
biggest crunch as far as sales ogun said 
dextromethorphan the active ingredient in about 75 cough 
medicines including robitussin and vicks 44 first came on the 
market as a prescription medicine in the mid1950s it was approved 
for overthecounter sales in 1976 
officials said the drug is safe and effective when taken as 
prescribed but it can produce effects ranging from lightheadedness 
to hallucinations when ingested in large doses ogun said someone 
who drinks large amounts runs a risk of convulsions a allergic 
reaction or a slowdown in bodily functions he was unaware of any 
fatalities from abuse 
there is no comprehensive information on the extent of abuses 
but ogun said he was aware of at least 50 cases statewide 
were concerned with it here locally because its not illegal 
to buy it possess it or drink it said waynesboro police chief 
glenn phenicie 
its probably been a problem longer than we realize he 
added 
pennsylvania is not the first state to confront abuse linked to 
robitussin and other cough preparations in utah a group of 
parents led a successful campaign to have robitussin voluntarily 
placed behind pharmacy counters 
police said they favored the proposal to limit access to cough 
syrups but the nonprescription drug manufacturers association an 
industry group said such a move would create an inconvenience for 
legitimate consumers 
for the industry there is a lot at stake according to kline amp 
co a new jersey business consulting firm the 14 leading cough 
syrups containing dextromethorphan have a wholesale market of about 
625 million annually nationwide 
controlling sales would literally remove that convenient 
access to that medicine to the vast majority of people who use it 
safely and effectively said vincent clough an association 
spokesman 
the industry would not oppose voluntary controls clough said 
he added that the association was working with local officials in 
waynesboro and had provided pamphlets for distribution 
ah robins which manufacturers robitussin cough syrups said 
in a statement it was working with the association and other 
companies to address the misuse of dextromethorphan 
the us food and drug administration has formed a task force 
that is looking into reported abuses of dextromethorphan 
the state board on drugs devices and cosmetics plans to hold a 
hearing on aug 28 on the pharmacists request a recommendation 
will be forwarded to the state secretary of health who has the 
authority to reclassify drugs
