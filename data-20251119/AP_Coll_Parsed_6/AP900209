cbs news humorist andy rooney was suspended for 
three months without pay thursday although he denied making racial 
comments attributed to him in a gay magazine 
he was suspended after meeting with cbs news president david 
burke 
i guess he burke believes the person who said i said it 
rooney said referring to chris bull the reporter whose interview 
with rooney will be published friday by the advocate a biweekly 
magazine based in los angeles 
rooneys suspension is immediate he wont be seen this sunday 
in his usual 60 minutes slot a spokesman for the program said 
id like to think that my temporary departure would cause 60 
minutes ratings to plummet rooney said a statement but the 
show is too good without me for that to happen 
former cbs anchorman walter cronkite rooneys friend since the 
two were correspondents in world war ii came to his defense with a 
statement that seemed to indirectly criticize his friends 
suspension 
rooney is not a racist cronkite said his more outrageous 
comments may offend some people from time to time he added 
but any suggestions that such a rare journalistic voice should be 
silenced indicates a dangerous weakness in our pluralistic 
society 
cronkite was unavailable to elaborate on his statement his 
office said 
bulls article quoted rooney as saying that most people are 
born with equal intelligence but blacks have watered down their 
genes because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the 
most children they drop out of school early do drugs and get 
pregnant 
i do deny saying it said rooney who has worked in news 
and entertainment at cbs for 40 years and has been the resident 
humorist at 60 minutes since 1978 in a brief phone interview 
he declined to say whether he thought burkes action was fair 
rooneys cbs biography gives his age as 70 whos who in 
america gives it as 71 
but in his statement later he said the controversy put burke 
in a difficult position and i accepted his offer of suspension 
rather than to permanently end my career at cbs 
rooney won his first emmy award in 1968 for his script for a 
special about lacks black history lost stolen or strayed a 
program narrated by bill cosby 
in his statement rooney again denied a uttering a racial slur 
i did not say nor would i ever have thought that blacks have 
watered down their genes it is a knownothing statement which i 
abhor 
the advocate article in which rooney also discussed 
homosexuals was entitled andy we hardly knew ye and had a 
subtitle and now a few homophobic minutes with andy rooney 
rooneys suspension came just more than two years after cbs 
fired jimmy the greek snyder as an nfl today commentator 
after snyder told a tv interviewer that blacks were better than 
whites as athletes because they were bred that way during the 
days of slavery in america 
burke didnt return phone calls and was unavailable to say 
specifically why he suspended rooney his statement announcing the 
action strongly suggested that it was due to the remarks attributed 
to rooney 
he said he had discussed with rooney those reported remarks and 
that i have made it clear that cbs news cannot tolerate such 
remarks or anything that approximates such comments 
mr rooney has expressed his dismay that the values of cbs 
news have been called into question and offers his deepest 
apologies to any in our society who are given offense 
at the end of rooneys suspension burke said we will have 
further discussions about his future association with cbs news 
rooney said he wanted to continue with cbs after his suspension 
ends i hope so he said i hope that i will 
he said he would continue writing his twiceweekly syndicated 
humor column which he said is distributed to about 260 newspapers 
bull who says he didnt taperecord his interview with rooney 
on thursday reiterated that his quotations of rooney taken down 
during a phone interview three weeks ago were accurate 
on wednesday benjamin hooks director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people described 
rooneys reported remarks to the magazine as illinformed and 
racist and new york mayor david dinkins called cbs to register 
shock according to a spokesman 
rooney earlier got in hot water with homosexual groups because 
of because a remark he made in a dec 28 cbs special a year with 
andy rooney 1989 
in that show he said that many of the ills which kill us are 
selfinduced and then cited too much alcohol too much food 
homosexual unions cigarettes

first a judge said begging in subways and 
terminals was ok then a court said beggars could be banned 
everything had changed for these panhandlers and everything was 
still the same 
they were still hungry and they were still homeless 
are you going to give us some money no then go get out of 
here said one homeless man at pennsylvania station on thursday 
another man stood at the entrance with a cup and a sign 
homeless and i dont drink hungry thank you very much god 
bless you all 
he demanded money for an interview saying i know my rights 
he did not know that he had lost a right that he had temporarily 
the legal right to panhandle at the railroad station 
on jan 25 a federal judge barred the metropolitan 
transportation authority and the port authority of new york and new 
jersey from enforcing a rule banning beggars from the subway system 
and rail and bus stations 
us district judge leonard sand ruled that panhandling was a 
form of free speech protected by the constitution 
then on wednesday the 2nd us circuit court of appeals put 
sands decision on hold while the ruling is appealed 
begging was illegal once again 
caren gardner a spokeswoman for the transit authority which 
operates the subways said the agency is resuming its operation 
enforcement and rules banning begging and other activities it 
believes are offensive to commuters 
were just going to go ahead and enforce the rules and 
regulations that do exist in the subway system she said 
police officers said thursday they had yet to be told to crack 
down on beggars or anyone else as a result of the court ruling 
how you doing working hard transit authority police 
officer brian newcombe asked one homeless beggarn in penn station 
as she walked past with a coffee cup containing several coins she 
smiled and moved on 
i dont throw them out he said i just ask them not to do 
it in front of token booths 
newcombe said the homeless fight for territory in the train 
station 
the port authority is like a jungle he said of the bus 
terminal located on the edge of times square an area infested with 
drug dealers pickpockets and homeless people its safer here 
at the bus terminal on thursday dozens of homeless poked 
through garbage cans loitered by stairways and remained curled up 
and sleeping beneath blankets on floors or benches as noon 
approached 
port authority spokesman mark marchese said it would resume 
preventing the homeless from sleeping at its bus and rail station 
but it had never forced them to leave its not a heartless 
operation that we run he said

not far from the smithsonians museums and 
galleries is a photo exhibit with shock value sen jesse helms and 
his antipornography partisans wont be offended but frequent 
travelers might consider staying home next time 
hanging along the main hallway at the national transportation 
safety boards headquarters are 25 pictures of charred broken 
aircraft a burnedout school bus a collapsed bridge derailed 
trains automobiles engulfed in flames and a crippled tanker 
sliding beneath the waves 
the gruesome gallery was the idea of acting board chairman james 
l kolstad whose agency annually investigates about 3000 
accidents from plane crashes to gas pipeline ruptures and 
studies such safety concerns as drug abuse among truck drivers 
my purpose was to display graphic examples of just how 
horrendous these accidents can be in the hope that they wont 
happen again kolstad said i want to remind everyone of what 
can happen when mistakes are made in the cockpit of a plane the 
cab of a truck or the bridge of a ship 
kolstad sponsored an agencywide photo contest and invited his 
320 employees to send their best or worst action pictures to 
washington for judging each of the 12 winning entries netted a 
100 prize for dramatic impact other photos on display came from 
newspapers accident witnesses and other sources 
the unfortunate part of our business is that we get some great 
disaster pictures said kolstad aide john moulden 
one of the most dramatic scenes in the gallery is a color photo 
of the us tanker american eagle sinking in the gulf of mexico in 
1984 after it exploded and broke in half killing seven crew 
members 
the notorious tanker exxon valdez is pictured in drydock with 
inspectors examining the twisted hull that struck a reef and 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into alaskas prince 
william sound last march 
one of the boards favorites shows a nearcatastrophe a 
piedmont jetliner that overshot the airport runway at charlotte 
nc in 1986 and plowed to a halt just yards from railway tracks 
carrying an oncoming train 
another narrowly averted disaster is seen in the scarred hull of 
the americanowned cruise liner celebration which was carrying 
2200 people when it collided last year with a cuban freighter in 
the caribbean the freighter sank and three crewmen died but none 
aboard the cruise ship was injured 
had the freighter been traveling faster and the celebration 
slower there probably would have been a substantial loss of life 
and a significant catastrophe at sea said kolstad 
said agency spokesman alan pollock this is a sober reminder 
of the seriousness of what we do and the tragedies we deal with

majority rule free speech political liberty 
government by the consent of the governed 
these exalted concepts helped topple governments throughout 
eastern europe last year but the past few weeks have shown that 
democracy is not necessarily the only alternative to totalitarian 
rule mob rule is another 
if despotic governments can trample on human rights so can 
intolerant masses while democracy may well take root in eastern 
europe that outcome is not preordained 
we do not call democratic a regime in which 51 percent of the 
population may slaughter the remaining 49 percent with impunity 
says leslek kolakowski a polish emigre and student of marxism 
the loosening of totalitarian reins in eastern europe has 
exposed political ethnic and religious bigotry that the 
postmarxist regimes may have difficulty containing 
bulgarians by the thousands for example used their newly won 
liberty to protest a decision by the fledgling government in late 
december to end yes end oppression against the turkish 
minority 
the episode produced an irony guess which political group was 
perhaps the most stalwart defender of turkish rights the bulgarian 
communist party somewhat of a latecomer to the civil liberties 
camp 
in the soviet union there are some who apparently believe that 
one of the best uses of free speech is harassment of jews the 
antisemitism is such that jews are applying to emigrate in record 
numbers 
there was always antisemitism said meron nekterman an 
electrician who emigrated recently to israel but before people 
were afraid to say what they really thought now they can come 
forward and say straightforward exactly what they want theres no 
longer any room in the soviet union for jews nekterman told the 
new york times 
the small jewish community in east germany may feel the same way 
about their country on monday hundreds of skinheads goosestepped 
through leipzig shouting praise of hitler as well as bigoted chants 
including to hell with the jews 
as in the soviet union antisemitism had been largely contained 
in east germany during 40 years of rigid marxist rule 
in romania the bright hope of many for a multiparty democracy 
was set back somewhat last week when thousands of government 
supporters laid siege to the headquarters of two opposition 
parties demanding their dissolution on grounds they were trying to 
organize a coup 
in the soviet union glasnost has meant the lifting of the dead 
hand of repression but it also has galvanized longsuppressed 
ethnic hatreds in the transcaucus region and demands by some 
shiites in azerbaijan for either reunification with iran or 
outright independence 
now it is up to the new rulers in eastern europe to decide on a 
question that the traditional democracies historically have had 
difficulty with how much leeway should be given to nondemocratic 
forces in a democratic country at what point does free expression 
infringe on the rights of society as a whole 
americans given their own history have little grounds to be 
smug about eastern europes democratic growing pains at the time 
of the nations birth political liberty was limited to white male 
landowners almost 200 years passed before all blacks were assured 
the right to vote 
columnist charles krauthammer predicts that once the euphoria of 
ousting the tyrants is passed political disillusionment in eastern 
europe is inevitable 
democracy in the abstract is a glory second to none 
krauthammer has written but liberated europe is about to 
experience the first half of churchills famous quip that democracy 
is the worst form of government except for all the others

just in case people with low selfesteem want to 
hear that they may have another problem here it is new research 
suggests that happy events in their lives may make them feel sick 
later on 
the culprit appears to be stress that arises when good fortune 
such as finding a sweetheart or landing a promotion forces them to 
reassess their low selfimages researchers said 
if you think of yourself as basically a loser and all of a 
sudden youre accepted in the best sorority in town and youre 
doing really well in school youre forced to rethink some key 
aspects of who you are said researcher jonathon brown 
support for the idea comes from two studies conducted by brown 
an assistant professor of psychology at the university of 
washington and kevin mcgill of southern methodist university in 
dallas the work appears in the december issue of the journal of 
personality and social psychology 
one study included 261 students in grades 7 to 11 at a girls 
school in the los angeles area and the other focused on 107 
students at southern methodist researchers measured the 
selfesteem of the students and asked them which major life 
events from a list had occurred to them over the previous 12 
months 
the list included such events as breaking up with a lover or 
getting a new one or losing or adding a family member the 
participants also indicated whether they considered the event to be 
positive negative or neutral 
in the girls school study students were asked four months 
later about illnesses they developed since completing the survey 
for students with low selfesteem the more positive events they 
had recorded the more colds sore throats sinus infections ear 
infections and laryngitis they tended to report during the 
followup period 
in contrast for students with high selfesteem positive events 
led to fewer reports of illness during the followup period 
the southern methodist study found similar results when it 
looked at how often the students visited the health center for 
physical illness 
neither study verified medically whether the students were 
actually sick noted sheldon cohen psychology professor at 
carnegie mellon university such illness behaviors as reporting 
symptoms or visiting the health service are not necessarily good 
indicators of true disease he said 
that is because some people do get medically ill but fail to 
recognize the symptoms while others think they are sick when they 
are not actually diseased he said in a telephone interview 
most studies on the impact of life events have looked at illness 
behaviors rather than verified disease he said verification is 
costly and timeconsuming said cohen who has done research on the 
topic 
while there is good evidence that life events can influence 
illness behaviors a link to physical disease is a much iffier 
issue he said 
recent work has suggested that only negative events increase the 
risk of feeling ill he said the new studys hypothesis about 
positive events is creative and interesting he said 
brown acknowledged you have to be real cautious about saying 
that the positive life events were leading to disease itself 
brown said similar studies should be done in older people to 
see if the effect shows up for more serious illnesses such as heart 
disease he also said that although his studies included mostly 
females he believed the results pertain to both sexes

researchers have found the first gene able to 
suppress formation of prostate tumors one of the most common 
cancers among men according to a study published today 
the gene called the retinoblastoma gene or rb was found in 
earlier studies to block the formation of a rare cancer of the eye 
in a science magazine study published today scientists at the 
university of californiasan diego say they have shown that a 
normally functioning rb gene inserted into human prostate cancer 
cells is able to suppress formation of tumors 
the rb gene is usually missing mutated or not functioning in 
such tumors 
dr robert bookstein one of the researchers said the study may 
aid progress toward learning how to control cancer through use of 
tumor suppressor genes such as rb or the proteins that such genes 
produce 
the idea with cancer suppressor genes since the loss of the 
product is oncogenic cancer nurturing is that maybe putting it 
back somehow will be therapeutic bookstein said 
that is a distant goal but i think a valid goal you could 
call it gene therapy that directly makes up for the defect in 
the tumor cell 
such cancer therapy however is years and years away he 
said 
barry nelkin a cancer suppressor gene researcher at the johns 
hopkins university oncology center said the california study is 
potentially quite important 
a lot of people are looking for the genetic link to prostate 
cancer the few studies that have been done have not pointed to 
anything specific he said 
nelkin said finding that the rb gene is a suppressor in prostate 
cancer gives us a clue as to the mechanism of tumor genesis 
bookstein said scientists in the california study used a 
retrovirus to insert the rb gene into human prostate cancer cells 
that did not contain the gene 
the genetically treated cancer cells were injected into the 
right flanks of 20 nude mice a breed of laboratory mice that 
lacks an immune system the scientists injected untreated prostate 
cancer cells into the left flank of the mice 
within two months tumors formed in the left flank of all the 
mice three of the 20 mice did not develop any tumors in the right 
flank the right flank tumors that did develop in 17 mice were up 
to 350 times smaller than the leftflank cancers 
bookstein said the fact that tumors formed at all in the right 
flank showed that the transfer of the rb gene to the cancer cells 
was not perfect he said laboratory studies showed that the tumors 
that developed either lacked the rb gene or it was mutated 
cells that expressed the rb gene were unable to form tumors 
he said 
bookstein said much more work is needed to understand the role 
of suppressor genes in prostate cancer formation 
this is only the first tumor suppressor gene implicated in 
prostate cancer he said undoubtedly there are others i have 
already found cases with normal rb genes so other genes have to be 
involved 
scientists at the university of californiasan diego laboratory 
headed by wenhwa lee reported in 1988 that the rb gene was able to 
block tumor formation in the cells of retinoblastoma a rare eye 
cancer 
other laboratories have found suppressor genes for breast bone 
and lung cancer 
the latest study was coauthored by bookstein lee jinyuh 
shew phanglang chen and peter scully all of the university of 
californiasan diego it is in todays edition of science the 
journal of the american association for the advancement of science

the predawn mist melted quickly but 
was replaced by swirling smoke from tiny devotional fires as 
thousands of hindu pilgrims prepared for their annual day of 
penance 
their rites began at the river as they splashed in dirty water 
and prayed with relatives and friends mothers led their toddlers 
into the stream 
a man dressed only in shorts and with his head freshly shaved 
stepped from the water into a shuffle dance while others chanted 
encouragement and lit incense his eyes glittered he drooled and 
his limbs twitched spasmodically the chanting became louder and 
his dance more frenzied as sacred ash was slapped on his head the 
frenzy subsided in a few minutes and he seemed to fall into a 
trance 
helping hands perched him on a small stool and carefully forced 
a metal spike the size of a knitting needle through his cheeks a 
smaller rod was run through his tongue from top to bottom helpers 
attached barbed hooks weighted with limes to his back 
he didnt bleed and he suffered no apparent pain 
this was thaipusam in the tamil lunar month of thai when the 
moon is in transit across the brightest star pusa in the zodiacal 
sign of cancer it was thursday in malaysia this year and the 
scene described at batu caves nine miles north of the capital 
kuala lumpur was repeated elsewhere in the country by the hindu 
devout on that day 
officials expected more than 500000 at batu caves for the 
2day festival the annual mortification of the flesh is done to 
pay homage to the hindi deity lord subramaniam seek atonement 
give thanks and fulfill vows 
thousands of bedazzled foreign tourists also made the trek 
lending the religious ceremony the raucous atmosphere of a carnival 
sideshow complete with a ferris wheel trinkets and balloons 
featured players at the festival were the 3000 who registered 
with temple officials to carry a kavadi 
these ranged from relatively small wooden yokes decorated with 
peacock feathers tinsel and brightly colored paper to 60pound 
steel frames with dozens of spikes to penetrate the flesh at many 
points the kavadi symbolizes paravani lord subramaniams peacock 
steed 
to the uninitiated thaipusam at batu stone caves is a jolt a 
stunning assault on the senses where intense religious devotion is 
expressed among a throng of gawking sightseers 
while family and friends and devotional songs and beat drums 
humans covered with hooks cheeks pierced with spears and tongues 
with arrows walked a halfmile from the river to 272 concrete 
steps leading to cathedral cave 
the procession was a startstop affair as cars edged through the 
dusty column and the gates were occasionally lowered at a grade 
crossing between the river and the cave for passing trains kavadi 
carriers passed several acres of temporary stalls offering food 
drink clothing toys wood carvings and pictures of indian movie 
stars baubles bangles and beads were available along with vitamin 
pills and govindas vegetarian pizza 
bearded mendicants solicited alms small boys sold camphor 
pellets to be burned as devotional flames by the faithful once 
inside the cave a tour director cautioned his cameratoting 
charges against pickpockets 
kavadi carriers shuffled faster and whirled in circles as they 
approached the steps several insisted on making the climb in quick 
spurts of 20 or more steps at a time 
the stairs are divided in the middle with human traffic kept to 
the left going up and descended on the right soldiers police and 
whitesuited firstaid attendants helped control the crowd 
the vast limestone cave was lit inside by strings of electric 
lights devotional fires and a beam of daylight from a vertical 
shaft through the top at one end thousands packed the main floor 
of the cavern which smelled of incense sweat jasmine and bat 
dung 
penitents headed for a grotto holding the jewelencrusted image 
of lord subramaniam a priest removed the spikes and some kavadi 
carriers collapsed in exhaustion and religious fervor sacred ash 
and lime juice was applied to their wounds but even after the 
trance lifted there was no apparent pain 
several years ago researchers from the united states and 
australia separately investigated the seeming lack of pain but 
without conclusive results they did say that the lime juice and 
sacred white ash found to be mostly burned cow manure had nothing 
to do with it 
the few willing to talk about their deed said it was done for 
intensely personal reasons one said he vowed to carry a kavadi for 
three years after he regained his health after a motorcycle crash 
another said he did it to honor his father 
the tradition at batu caves originated before the turn of the 
century temple chairman s sockalingam said hindus in india have 
many sacred places in hills and mountains and there are celebrated 
cave temples tamils from southern india brought the observance of 
thaipusam when they came to what was then malaya to tap rubber 
india has banned such selftorture but it continues here with 
unabated fervor sockalingam said some of the wooden rods used to 
pierce the cheeks had been growing so long that a oneyard limit 
was imposed this year

the remains of eight 
american servicemen killed more than two decades ago in the vietnam 
war were returned home to military honors under a steel gray sky 
home at last said a sign behind about 150 soldiers and 
veterans who watched the arrival thursday of a military transport 
plane a brief ceremony was capped by the traditional playing of 
taps which echoed across the cold concrete airport apron as 
flagdraped caskets were carried to hearses 
earlier in the day the remains identified by the armys central 
identification laboratory in hawaii had been placed aboard the jet 
at hickam air force base 
six sets of remains belonged to army soldiers killed in the 
crash of a south vietnamese air force ch34 helicopter shot down in 
laos on nov 30 1968 the remains were recovered in a joint 
excavation by the governments of the united states and laos in 
march air force officials said 
the remains were identified as those of maj samuel k toomey 
iii of independence mo 1st lt raymond c stacks of memphis 
tenn sgt 1st class arthur e bader jr of atlantic city nj 
sgt 1st class gary r la bohn of wixom mich sgt 1st class 
klaus e scholz of amarillo texas and sgt 1st class michael h 
mein of cape vincent ny 
also among the eight remains were those of a serviceman who died 
oct 2 1968 his name was withheld at the request of his family 
the eighth set of remains was identified in november as that of 
air force col charles d roby of iowa park texas 
roby was killed while flying an f4 phantom jet on a 
reconnaissance mission over north vietnam march 3 1967

us and latin officials are close to 
agreement on a communique for next weeks drug summit pledging us 
help to revamp the drugdependent economies of peru bolivia and 
colombia sources say 
the communique to be signed at the fournation meeting also 
would commit president bush to press other western nations to 
provide economic aid to the andean nations said a south american 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity 
the document is being prepared for the signature of bush and the 
presidents of the three andean countries who will meet feb 15 for 
a drug summit in cartagena colombia 
us military assistance to the andean countries is not spelled 
out in the document but the latins have insisted it be restricted 
to equipment and training rather than direct us military 
involvement in interdiction said the south american diplomat 
those familiar with the document described it as broad in tone 
without specifying how much money the united states would give the 
latin nations in exchange for their participation in the war on 
drug production and trafficking 
however the document will get into specific issues regarding 
interdiction and military cooperation economic alternatives to the 
drug trade and efforts to get other countries aid in the 
antidrug effort said michael skol deputy assistant secretary of 
state for south american affairs 
were very close to agreeing among the countries on final 
wording skol said thursday 
he called the document a very comprehensive document of 
cooperation on the drug issue that recognizes rights and 
responsibilities of producer and consumer countries without 
fingerpointing 
among the promises expected from bush at the summit according 
to those familiar with the summit communique are 
tighter enforcement on export of precursor drugs such as 
ether that are used in the production of cocaine from coca leaves 
money for crops to substitute for the lucrative coca fields 
promotion of private initiatives for trade opportunities and 
technical assistance to help the andean countries expand their 
markets 
support for expanded trade opportunities for the andean 
countries 
pressure on other nations to help the drugproduction nations 
with economic and trade assistance 
in addition to the communique the summit may produce an 
agreement between bolivia and the united states to renew an 
extradition treaty that has not been updated since 1900 said one 
diplomatic source 
the white house has praised bolivia for extradition action 
particularly the december extradition of an alleged drug 
trafficker luis arce gomez but the bolivian law itself was 
written before drug crimes were considered and thus does not 
address them specifically 
the us portion of the summit communique is said to hew closely 
to what bush proposed last month for the second year of his 
national drug control strategy 
bush has proposed 206 million in new antidrug spending in 
military law enforcement and economic assistance for the andean 
nations in the 1991 fiscal year as part of a fouryear 22 
billion plan the administration has said that allocation of money 
is dependent on cooperation by the drugproducing nations in the 
antidrug efforts 
perus president alan garcia recently scoffed at us 
proposals for antidrug spending as insufficient to combat the 
multibilliondollar industry garcia also was irked with the us 
invasion of panama in december and agreed to attend the drug 
summit only after president bush promised to withdraw the invasion 
troops by the end of the month 
the document addresses the issues of money laundering and 
control of us export of weapons that are used by drug lords and 
could provide for information sharing on gun exports said one 
source 
president virgilio barco is known to be anxious to talk to bush 
about the need to reinstate a coffee export quota system that was 
beneficial to colombian farmers it was unclear if coffee will be 
addressed in the presidents communique or will be included in 
general terms under the category of us assistance to redirect the 
latin countries economies away from drugs

crude oil began washing up on a 
popular beach thursday evening as cleanup boats skimmed the ocean 
around a tanker that spewed 295000 gallons after apparently being 
punctured by an anchor 
small black globules of alaskan crude oil splashed a 
quartermile stretch of newport beach a community that includes 
some of southern californias mostexpensive beachfront property 
the 811foot tanker american trader which had carried 21 
million gallons lay off the coast surrounded by an oil containment 
boom and coast guard boats workers labored to patch a 3foot hole 
punched through the ships bottom near an offshore mooring station 
wednesday 
every indication is the vessel is no longer leaking oil 
coast guard rear adm william kime told a press conference after an 
inspection flight 
the slick covered an area measuring 3 miles by 6 miles offshore 
winds held the purple sheen away from beaches until afternoon then 
reversed direction and began nudging the mess onto shore 
the main part of the oil slick is still staying threequarters 
to one mile offshore said huntington beach mayor tom mays who 
flew over the slick in a helicopter at dusk a major portion of 
the spill or the slick is heading directly to the newport beach 
pier 
huntington beach fire department capt bill newton said thick 
black gobs of crude were hitting along a quartermile of the beach 
at about 830 pm the oil didnt appear to be covering the beach 
in thick sheets 
mays said about 300 professional cleanup workers were waiting to 
begin shoveling up the oil beach beginning at low tide friday 915 
am 
coast guard commandant adm paul yost said the ships hull 
apparently was punctured when it hit something on the bottom as the 
crew prepared to hook up to an underwater pipeline that carries 
crude oil to shore it was unclear if the tanker hit one of its own 
anchors or a buoy anchor he said 
five skimmer boats were at work and four more were en route to 
the area off the orange county coastline about 35 miles southeast 
of los angeles 
along the shore booms were laid to protect the environmentally 
delicate estuaries at the santa ana river mouth anaheim bay bolsa 
chica wetlands and upper newport bay all teeming with wildlife 
biologist esther burket said oil coming ashore on a sandy beach 
would be less harmful than in an estuary such as bolsa chica where 
birds would ingest the petroleum with the plants they eat 
once it gets onto vegetation its a nightmare burket said 
eighteen oilsoaked seabirds mostly western grebes were 
rescued from the beach and cleaned by volunteers at a lifeguard 
headquarters the count of dead birds totaled eight said state 
wildlife biologist jon fisher 
curt taucher a fish and game spokesman said there was some 
initial concern about migrating gray whales but that was not the 
biggest worry the concern is for the furbearing animals harbor 
seals animals like that he said 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said in a press release 
that president bush would be briefed and that everything that can 
be done is being done 
the broad sandy beach at this city of 180000 in northern 
orange county plus bolsa chica state beach to the northwest and 
huntington state beach to the south draw millions of sunbathers 
and surfers during summer 
federally mandated alcohol tests given to the ships captain 
identified as robert laware the pilot first mate and second mate 
all came back negative the coast guard said drug test results 
were in complete 
the american trader was last boarded by the coast guard on dec 
28 in san francisco and was found free of violations were found 
its last certificate of inspection was issued in honolulu on may 
11 1989 
after the hole in the tanker is patched the coast guard plans to 
pump the remaining oil from the punctured compartment into a barge 
the same pumps were used to unload the exxon valdez when it ran 
aground in alaska last year and spilled more than 10 million 
gallons of crude into prince william sound 
there were no formal discussions on use of chemical dispersants 
said rolf mall deputy regional manager for the state department of 
fish and game damage from chemicals has to be weighed against harm 
from the oil he said 
the further out it gets and the deeper the water the more 
likely it is well use them mall said 
mindful of the massive exxon valdez spill in alaska last year 
california politicians rushed to call for tighter controls on oil 
shipping and stiffer penalties for spills 
this is a wakeup call said lt gov leo mccarthy 
the american trader was chartered by british petroleum oil 
shipping co usa said joe braderich manager of the firms los 
angeles field office 
the spill began wednesday afternoon while the tanker maneuvered 
1 miles off huntington beach to moor at a nest of mooring buoys at 
an offloading station for an underwater pipeline leading to a 
refinery on shore 
the depth at the accident site was unclear the coast guard put 
the depth at 84 feet however huntington beach marine safety 
officer steve reuter said it was 56 feet 
the ship owned and operated by american trading transportation 
co of new york drops two bow anchors during such maneuvering 
said company president sanford schmidt 
a swell may have lifted the ship and swung one anchor against 
the bottom schmidt said in a telephone interview after speaking 
with the ships captain 
a diver found a 3foot hole in the singlehull bottom of the no 
1 forward compartment a tank which holds more than 1 million 
gallons of crude industry critics say tankers should have double 
hulls for safety 
the coast guards pacific area strike team was called in from 
its base in san francisco bp with its office in los angeles 
hired a local cleanup company clean coastal waters to recover the 
oil but the cost of that work will be paid by american trading or 
its insurance company 
the american trader had picked up alaskan oil from the vessel 
keystone canyon in long beach harbor and was to offload some of it 
at the offshore pipeline for golden west refinery in santa fe 
springs said bp spokesman chuck webster 
an oil industry newsletter oil spill intelligence report of 
arlington mass said the spill was the thirdlargest in 
california waters in the last 10 years the largest was 16 million 
gallons of bunker fuel from a 1984 sinking off san francisco the

the royal shakespeare company has announced it 
will close its two london theaters for four months citing the need 
for what falstaff called a remedy against this consumption of the 
purse 
the theaters staff of nearly 70 in london will draw half its 
regular pay while performances are suspended beginning in 
november artistic director terry hands said on thursday 
the companys two theaters in stratforduponavon shakespeares 
birthplace will not be affected 
the current sellout productions of hamlet and a midsummer 
nights dream plus the companys earnings from les 
miserables the international musical hit were not enough to 
make up for a financial shortfall hands told a news conference 
thursday 
im haunted by the specter of endless revivals of peter pan 
to pay for endless revivals of peter pan he said referring to 
the jm barrie play that has been a christmas perennial 
it is the 90s it is a new decade it is the moment to 
reassess the policies that have brought us to this point and all 
i can say is those policies are not working hands said 
it is the first time the company has taken such a move no 
performances will be affected because the theaters will not be 
closed until november and plays are not scheduled that far in 
advance 
the news came three weeks after the company announced an 
unusually small 19901991 season of 21 productions on tuesday the 
company opened a stage production of a clockwork orange to 
mixed reviews but capacity business 
hands said the 1162seat barbican theater and the studio pit 
theater with flexible seating for up to 240 will close for four 
months from nov 5 he said that would save the company about 275 
million on its projected 199091 budget 
hands who steps down at the end of the year said he opted for 
the closures keeping in mind his successor or successors to be 
named next week 
i believe in departing that whoever comes next should be 
relieved of the nightmare of the past 12 years without having 
to spend threequarters of the day raising saving or making 
money he said referring to the funding woes that have beset the 
company throughout the 1980s 
hands said the companys deficit will be 49 million by next 
month thirty percent of its annual budget of 321 million comes 
from government subsidies 
more than 40 percent of the operating costs at the royal 
national theater britains other flagship subsidized playhouse 
are met by government grants 
hands called on the government to keep its funding in line with 
inflation as recommended in a report in 1984 he said funding 
increases have either been at a standstill or lagged behind 
inflation 
of the upcoming repertory hands said im putting everything 
back on the drawing board from june because every single risk must 
be eliminated every single penny must be made 
the new musical children of eden with music by american 
composer stephen schwartz will open in 1991 in stratford instead 
of dec 5 in london as planned 
in 1985 the national theater closed its cottesloe auditorium 
for five months to cut costs 
sue rose press officer at the arts council which distributes 
government money to the arts said the organization was sympathetic 
but had already allocated our funding for the year

sen daniel patrick moynihan says his plan to 
cut social security taxes would neither endanger retirement 
benefits nor worsen the federal deficit but he apparently is 
winning little support for the plan 
the tax rates in the bill will fully finance benefits and 
maintain a safe reserve fund for 20 years longer than the current 
arrangement moynihan dny said in defending his plan before 
the senate finance committee 
this point is conceded by all but those who favor the politics 
of fear he said thursday 
president bush and his advisers have argued against a social 
security tax cut on grounds it likely would lead to an increase in 
other taxes and jeopardize benefits for future retirees 
there was little show of support at the hearing for moynihans 
bill it was criticized by white house budget director richard g 
darman by robert d reischauer director of the congressional 
budget office by four of five nongovernment economists who 
testified and by committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas 
bentsen said he sees no way the government can afford to 
increase the budget deficit by the 38 billion to 55 billion that 
the tax cut would cost moynihan uses the lower figure darman the 
higher 
that 38 billion is no great sum to make up moynihan said 
adding that most of it could be found by cutting the defense budget 
the real point of course is that there are lots of ways to 
reduce the deficit but the social security tax is not the right 
way moynihan said by what right and for how long do we 
continue to make the budget deficit the peculiar burden of people 
who get paid by the hour 
moynihan wants to cut social security taxes so the government 
will no longer be able to use surplus collections to make the 
deficit in other federal accounts appear considerably smaller than 
it is the surplus which now is growing by about 1 billion a 
week is being accumulated for the benefit of workers in the 
postworld war ii generation who will be retiring in large numbers 
starting in about 2010 
reischauer who is congress chief economist said a social 
security tax cut without offsetting tax increases or spending cuts 
could worsen inflation and could harm the economys performance 
over the next several years 
regardless of what happens to moynihans bill reischauer added 
a permanent increase in taxes or reductions in other federal 
programs appears to be a certainty in the future since the 
retirement of the postworld war ii baby boom will mark the 
beginning of a permanent increase in the ratio of retirees to 
workers 
darman said the bill would either seriously damage attempts to 
cut the federal deficit or cause an increase in income taxes or 
other taxes 
raising other taxes would hurt the very workers senator 
moynihans proposal is ostensibly intended to help darman said 
indeed it would hurt them doubly first by jeopardizing their 
future retirement benefits and second by taking back in new taxes 
what it pretended to give in the way of a tax cut 
darman said the bush administration agrees with moynihan that 
the government should stop using surplus social security taxes to 
hide the size of the federal deficit but the answer he said is 
the administrations proposal which starting gradually in 1993 
would require that surplus social security taxes be used only to 
pay off federal debt 
a worker now pays a 765 percent social security tax on the 
first 51300 earned each year and the employer matches the 
payment moynihans bill would repeal a rate increase that went 
into effect jan 1 restoring the rate to 751 percent and cut it 
again next year to 655 percent

wheat farmers would be in serious trouble if 
the bush administrations proposals for flexibility in the 1990 
farm bill were accepted by congress says a wheat state congressman 
rep glenn english dokla told an agriculture department 
official at a hearing thursday that farm income in his district 
would decrease under the administration plan unveiled this week 
later english predicted that any region where agriculture 
depends on one crop would be in trouble under the proposal 
i dont think most members of congress would feel comfortable 
with the proposals set forth english said after a hearing of the 
house agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains 
it reminds me of the budget proposal its almost as if they 
arent trying to put forth serious proposals 
at the hearing english asked agriculture undersecretary john 
campbell to explain how the administrations proposal to allow 
planting options under the price support system would protect 
farmers confined by climate and terrain to one crop from losing 
their share of the market 
farmers are pretty sharp said campbell they will respond 
where appropriate 
english asked campbell to say hypothetically which commodity 
would be best to grow next year if the administrations proposal 
for flexibility were in force 
thats up to the farmer said campbell he would not 
elaborate further saying instead that it would be better for 
farmers to guess about market changes than about congressional 
action on farm programs 
english said in an interview after the hearing that he 
considered campbells responses an abdication of the 
administrations responsibility 
in the proposals agriculture secretary clayton yeutter sent to 
congress on tuesday the administration is suggesting that farmers 
be allowed to substitute crops that are covered by subsidy programs 
if they see marketplace advantages to doing so 
in order to assure that farmers will plant commodities consumers 
need the government sets price levels for certain products if the 
market price is below those levels known as target prices the 
government makes up the difference 
the commodities that are subsidized this way are wheat corn 
cotton rice soybeans barley grain sorghum and oats 
the administrations proposals intend to allow farmers to 
respond to market demands rather than government planting 
requirements while still having the shelter of government 
subsidies 
the problem as english and other see it is avoiding 
overplanting of certain crops 
the congressman said he was particularly concerned about wheat 
producers 
wheat in the past has been the most vulnerable because of the 
kind of program we have and because you can grow it in any part of 
the country he said 
he said theres a temptation for farmers to start producing 
wheat if given the option 
usually it is followed by a sharp reduction in price and a 
surplus he said that means we are back in these wild 
gyrations as far as price is concerned 
english said he expected congress to pass legislation that 
provides some flexibility 
flexibility is something that people talk about but no one 
seems to know what it means he said 
english said he believes yeutters involvement with the 
international trade talks known as gatt has much to do with the 
administrations refusal to be specific about price supports 
many countries subsidize their exports to a greater degree than 
the united states and yeutter is trying to get them to stop the 
practice the negotiations will continue through this year

congressional democrats are working on their 
own 1991 budget that would launch new education and other domestic 
initiatives while shrinking president bushs defense proposal by at 
least 4 billion to 7 billion 
but republicans predict their democratic rivals will be unable 
to piece together a spending plan and move it through congress 
without gop support 
just 10 days after bush unveiled his 123 trillion spending 
blueprint for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 congress majority 
democrats said they will write an alternate plan to meet the 64 
billion deficit target 
first were going to see if we can piece together a budget 
resolution house budget committee chairman leon panetta 
dcalif said thursday if we can do that in a way that well 
have the votes to get the budget resolution passed there wont be 
much reason to go ahead with negotiations with the bush 
administration 
but rep bill frenzel of minnesota ranking republican on the 
house budget committee said he doubted the democrats could craft a 
budget including all the programs they seek without adding new 
taxes and they dont want to be the ones leading the way on 
that 
my guess is after internal discussions theyll decide to 
request negotiations with the administration frenzel said 
the democrats fervor was illustrated when rep john murtha 
dpa chairman of the house appropriations defense subcommittee 
brandished a mock viking battle ax during a visit to the panel by 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of 
the joint chiefs of staff 
murtha said members of both parties are looking for a peace 
dividend in the budget reflecting possible military savings in 
response to the reduced soviet threat 
democrats pressed their offensive on other fronts as well at 
the joint economic committee chairman lee hamilton dind 
challenged bushs claim of having submitted a budget that met his 
campaign pledge of no new taxes 
in the budget you submitted 33 revenue changes and 20 of them 
raise revenue totaling an increase of 139 billion hamilton 
told bushs chief economic adviser michael boskin 
boskin argued there were only minor tax increases and that most 
of the receipts would come from new and higher fees for government 
services 
elsewhere house armed services committee chairman les aspin 
dwis accused the administration of using strategic arms talks 
with the soviets to win permission to deploy weapons congress does 
not want including nuclear missiles and the b2 stealth bomber 
liberal democrats have been complaining that bush should have 
cut far deeper than his 3033 billion defense proposal for next 
year that figure is 7 billion higher than this years total but 
32 billion below the amount needed to stay even with inflation 
liberals would like to see defense spending drop below 290 
billion 
but moderates such as panetta say they believe the figure will 
end up about 4 billion to 7 billion lower panettas senate 
counterpart sen james sasser dtenn has talked about military 
spending in the 291 billion to 296 billion range 
such figures would allow democrats to avoid 139 billion in 
cuts bush has proposed in programs such as the medicare program for 
the elderly and handicapped retirement payments to government 
workers and other benefit programs 
to hit the 64 billion grammrudman target democrats say they 
will seek to raise the 21 billion bush proposed in new tax 
receipts user fees sales of federal assets and other collections 
while changing some of the components of that mix 
democrats believe enough room will be left in the budget for 
some new domestic initiatives likely including education child 
care nutrition health care and housing 
democrats still dont know what to do about a proposal by sen 
daniel moynihan dny to cut the social security payroll tax a

opposition leaders say they fear the 
outgoing national salvation front will put former ranking communist 
leaders in control of a new government that is to run the country 
until elections in may 
the new council of national unity which holds its inaugural 
meeting today is to give 29 opposition parties a chance to 
participate in government it will be the first real opposition 
role since the communist takeover in 1947 
but valentin gabrielescu spokesman for the national peasants 
party told reporters thursday that he believed the fronts 
outgoing sevenmember ruling council may try to control the new 
180member unity council 
gabrielescu said the front may also try to pack the new 
government with former ranking members of the nowdefunct communist 
party which caved in with the overthrow and execution of communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu in december 
they can be former communists but not big game not the 
aristocracy of the party he said 
the 150member national salvation front took power after the 
popular revolution that toppled ceausescu the front lost four 
members of its original 11member council in the last three weeks 
including two who complained of dictatorial methods 
the front agreed to give up its monopoly on power last week 
after large demonstrations against it the protests were prompted 
by the fronts decision to participate in the may 20 election 
despite an earlier pledge not to run 
students who were in the forefront of the revolution and 
opposition parties said the front could not be both a player and a 
referee in the election 
under the agreement the front left its ruling council to run 
the country until the council of national unity started operating 
and split off its political wing to run in the election 
the new interim government will have 90 representatives from the 
front and 29 political parties each with three seats and 90 
prominent romanians from all walks of life not formally 
representing any parties 
dan radulescu the chief front spokesman served notice that the 
front intended to try for at least some of the nonparty seats 
he also said he expected interim president ion iliescu to head 
the government and if he isnt elected i dont know who will 
lead the council 
gabrielescu signaled opposition to iliescu a former communist 
however saying maybe he will be a candidate but we are against 
it 
also thursday the minister of religion said it will take years 
to undo the moral damage caused by more than four decades of 
communism which he said turned romania into a nation of liars 
and thieves 
nicolae stoicescu a former dissident and professor of medieval 
history said that under ceausescus 24year tenure the romanian 
orthodox church was under the direct control and supervision of 
securitate the dictators feared secret police 
stoicescu said the church has a major role to play in 
rehabilitating the romanian spirit and correcting damage caused 
by decades of communist rule

china and the soviet union today began a second 
round of talks aimed at reducing forces along their 4300mile 
border patrolled by hundreds of thousands of troops on each side 
the soviet embassy said the talks on cutting military forces and 
armaments along the frontier will continue until feb 22 
the official xinhua news agency reporting on the opening of the 
talks said the two sides commented positively on the first round 
of talks held in moscow last november and expressed readiness to 
make further efforts to reduce the military forces in the border 
area to the minimum level corresponding to their normal and 
goodneighborly relations 
an embassy official said the soviet delegation is led by gv 
kireev chief of the foreign ministry department for socialist 
countries in asia and consists of six diplomats and six military 
experts 
the two sides agreed to open talks on troop levels along the 
frontier when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev visited beijing 
in may 
gorbachev said the frontier should be turned into a border of 
peace and pledged to withdraw 12 divisions or 120000 soldiers 
from the border by the end of this year 
the soviet union is believed to have some 600000 troops along 
the chinese border china armed with less sophisticated equipment 
has an estimated 1 million troops on the frontier 
the two sides are also expected to discuss the concept of 
creating a demilitarized zone along the border proposed when soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze visited china a year ago 
the two communist powers fought a brief border war in 1969 and 
there have been sporadic clashes since then around disputed areas 
of the frontier tensions have gradually eased as the two sides 
moved to normalize diplomatic relations in recent years and 
crossborder trade has grown rapidly

fourteen of the 31 senators up for reelection 
in november are starting the year with at least 1 million on hand 
with most getting considerable help from political action 
committees according to an analysis released today 
sen phil gramm rtex was the fundraising kingpin raising 
105 million since his last election in 1984 and beginning this 
year with 61 million in his campaign coffers common cause said 
in a report based on recent federal election commission filings 
the poorest of the 31 was sen nancy kassebaum rkan who has 
raised just 90860 since the 1984 election and began 1990 with 
157817 in campaign funds 
common cause which has been lobbying for changes to 
substantially curtail pac activity said 25 of the 31 senators 
facing reelection this year have exceeded limits that would be 
placed on pac donations in a campaign finance bill the group 
supports 
of the 14 senators who began the year with more than 1 million 
democrat david boren of oklahoma was the only one who has not 
accepted any pac donations of all 31 only boren and democrat john 
kerry of massachusetts who had 874000 in campaign funds as of 
dec 31 accepted no pac contributions 
of the 29 whose campaigns took pac money gramm was also the 
leader receiving 11 million from pacs in the last six years 
according to common cause illinois democrat paul simon was not far 
behind reporting 976769 in pac contributions since the 1984 
election kassebaum was again at the bottom of the list accepting 
19250 from pacs since 1984 
the only senator remotely close to gramm in terms of cash on 
hand to begin the election year was bill bradley dnj who 
reported having 41 million mitch mcconnell a kentucky 
republican was next with 28 million democrat max baucus of 
montana had just more than 1 million 
gramm considered by some a potential republican presidential 
candidate in 1996 raised nearly 6 million in 1989 with most of 
that coming from a fundraiser at the houston astrodome attended by 
president bush 
bradleys active fund raising despite his virtually certain 
reelection has increased speculation he is considering challenging 
bush in 1992 or at least mulling a 1996 presidential bid 
common cause complains the highpowered fund raising by 
incumbents many of whom face little or no opposition can scare 
off potential challengers because of their ability to raise huge 
donations from pacs 
in releasing its analysis common cause president fred 
wertheimer renewed his call for congress to quickly enact new laws 
limiting pac donations and setting campaign spending limits 
common cause said the 31 senators together raised 774 million 
since all but one last faced election six years ago with 166 
million of that total coming from pacs the only senator in the 
group not involved in a 1984 senate election was republican dan 
coats of indiana who 13 months ago was appointed to replace vice 
president dan quayle in the senate

president bush claims no regrets over his 
restrained response to the historic political reforms in the soviet 
union and says he hopes both moscow and us allies see it as a 
stabilizing sign 
bush denied that his emphasizing of defense issues during his 
three days on the road coinciding with moscows dramatic moves 
toward a more democratic form of government was a matter of bad 
timing 
i think its fortuitous bush told reporters traveling home 
with him aboard air force one 
the president was back in the nations capital after a threeday 
western trip that focused on defense policy including his call for 
continued modernization of us strategic weapons systems 
he watched army war games in the mojave desert toured the 
lawrence livermore national laboratory near san francisco for an 
update on star wars research and toured the strategic air command 
headquarters in omaha neb 
at sac headquarters bush on thursday broadcast a message to 
nuclearcarrying us forces telling them the historical changes 
we are seeing in the soviet union are in no small part due to 
us nuclear deterrence 
he told reporters aboard air force one later thursday that he 
didnt think his assertiveness on national policy was out of sync 
with developments in moscow because it sends a clear message that 
i am behind a sensible defense program and ill stay behind it 
so i hope that message comes through in a balanced way that we 
are not going to suddenly drastically change our course away from 
a reasonable defense program bush said so i think the message 
is one of stability of reasonableness he added 
im not going to miss an opportunity in arms control but 
were going to keep a strong defense 
bush said he was trying to send a stabilizing message not a 
militant message 
and thats why i think the timing happened to be fortuitous 
because we had planned this trip before the central committee 
meeting but it worked out in my view very well 
he said he wanted western european allies to know that the 
united states was not about abandon them or decouple from 
europe 
as long as im president it wont take place bush said 
in remarks at a republican fundraising dinner in columbus 
ohio thursday night his last stop bush praised party leaders 
in moscow for taking the first step toward pluralism and a 
multiparty system

rep henry waxman wants federal law enforcers 
to treat animal rights groups that break into laboratories to make 
off with rabbits monkeys and other creatures as terrorists 
nothing but terrorists 
scientists told a congressional panel thursday that extremist 
groups such as the underground animal liberation front are creating 
a serious threat to university lab workers and researchers around 
the nation 
the scientists told waxmans energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment that they have faced arson burglary 
vandalism theft and hate mail from such groups 
waxman dcalif is proposing legislation to allow federal 
investigation and prosecution of people who break into and commit 
other crimes at laboratories receiving federal funds 
he said members of the underground animal rights movement are 
terrorists nothing but terrorists 
the department of health and human services originally supported 
waxmans measure but the bush administration has since said it is 
opposed to it because of justice department concerns that it will 
be difficult to enforce according to dr james o mason assistant 
secretary for health 
the antiabortion national right to life committee inc has 
joined other critics who say the bill would inhibit 
constitutionally protected forms of protest 
robert f phalen a laboratory director at the university of 
california in irvine medical school said dogs he was using for air 
pollution research were stolen in january 1988 and his family was 
later harassed 
in one case a caller harangued my 15yearold son saying that 
his father was evil and would burn in hell phalen said 
we always kept our doors locked we left external lights on 
we covered our phones at night with pillows and we slept with 
weapons near all of our beds he recalled 
but the most serious threat the scientists said is that 
students are turning away from animalrelated research out of fear 
animal rights groups many of which dissociate themselves from 
illegal tactics beyond civil disobedience say most of the research 
is needlessly cruel and could be duplicated by other more humane 
means

to most carolyn warmus is a bright 
energetic schoolteacher to police she is an obsessed woman who 
pumped nine shots into her lovers wife then met the man for 
drinks and sex 
it took a year of intense legwork by two detectives to put 
together the case that made a murder suspect out of the 26yearold 
computer science teacher and insurance heiress 
warmus was charged with seconddegree murder monday police said 
she shot betty jeanne solomon 40 nine times on jan 15 1989 
then drove to a local hotel to meet her lover fellow schoolteacher 
paul solomon for drinks and a sexual tryst in her car 
her attorney charles fiore maintains his client is innocent 
he said thursday that she passed a polygraph test taken on the 
advice of her family attorney five days after the slaying 
warmus was not the initial suspect in the killing solomon was 
you can compare it to a large puzzle with many many pieces 
said lt cornelius sullivan head of detectives in greenburgh a 
new york city suburb near white plains 
police would not say when their focus shifted to warmus 
daughter of a wealthy michigan insurance executive but a vacation 
trip to puerto rico five months after the killing may have been key 
in highlighting warmus alleged obsession with the dead womans 
husband 
police said solomon 39 told investigators that warmus followed 
him and a friend barbara ballor 28 to puerto rico once there 
they said she called a member of ballors family pretending to be 
a police officer and made disparaging comments about solomon in an 
apparent effort to break the couple up 
police traced the call back to warmus investigators then 
focused on other telephone records 
the paper trail led them to vincent parco a private 
investigator in new york city who told police he sold warmus a 
silencer and a 25caliber handgun the same type of weapon used to 
kill mrs solomon 
police say they linked the weapon that parco sold to the killing 
through ballistics evidence but did not elaborate the weapon has 
not been recovered 
on thursday parcos new york city pistol permit was suspended 
and parco agreed to give police his weapons said city police 
spokesman detective joseph mcconville 
law enforcement sources said warmus knew parco because she had 
hired him before to investigate an exboyfriend a married 
bartender who lived in new jersey 
police said warmus who lives in a highrise on manhattans east 
side told parco she needed the gun for protection but parcos 
expartner gabe laura told the new york post she offered him 
three different reasons 
we figured her for a flake laura said adding we told 
her to get us some proof about what she was saying and sent her 
away 
warmus and solomon had been having an affair for a year 
according to an indictment unsealed monday they met in 1987 at an 
elementary school in greenburgh 
at the time of mrs solomons murder police said warmus wanted 
to intensify the relationship solomon wanted to cool things off 
investigators said he ended the affair after his wifes death 
in her statement to police warmus said she called solomon at 
home hours before the murder and they talked for 45 minutes about 
everything from his 15yearold daughter kristans basketball team 
to a bar mitzvah he attended 
they agreed to meet for drinks at a yonkers hotel bar at 730 
pm mrs solomon was killed between 7 pm and 730 pm police 
said adding that warmus knew mrs solomon would be home alone 
warmus told detectives they left the bar at 1030 pm went out 
to her car in the parking lot and had sex before leaving each other 
about 1130 pm 
her attorney said warmus frequently had dinner with the solomon 
family at their home and that neighbors knew both her and her car 
it would be a pretty good trick for her to knock on the door 
kill her and leave and not be seen or have her car seen 
fiore said 
warmus father is president of american way life insurance co 
in southfield mich whose assets reportedly are about 150 
million she grew up in birmingham mich

illinois has joined a lawsuit filed by 
ethanol producers that accuses nine oil companies of running ads 
that discourage the use of ethanolblended gasoline 
attorney general neil hartigan said at a news conference 
thursday he filed an antitrust action with the us district court 
in danville that seeks a halt to the ad campaign and fines of 18 
million on the oil companies 
the oil companies are accused of using ads such as my gas 
contains no alcohol and my station sells clean gas to imply 
that ethanolblended gasoline is unsafe and pollutes 
ethanol a form of alcohol often distilled from corn helps 
illinois corn growers and improves the environment because its 
combustion produces less carbon monoxide than gasoline hartigan 
said gasoline blended with ethanol also lowers fuel prices he 
said 
in 1988 11 ethanol producers sued the oil companies in five 
states two of the companies that sued greater rockford energy and 
technology co and cepo inc of batavia were forced out of 
business in 1986 hartigan said 
this is nothing more than a consumer fraud perpetrated on an 
unsuspecting public said hartigan 
illinois may have lost millions of dollars in the last 10 
years through higher fuel prices and lost economic development 
opportunities through this action perhaps we can begin reaping 
the benefits of a truly fair competitive environment he said 
a spokesman for one of the companies amoco oil co declined to 
comment on hartigans action but criticized the lawsuit 
we feel its without merit said mike thompson we expect 
to contest it vigorously and we expect to win 
also named in the lawsuit were shell oil co exxon co usa 
mobil corp marathon petroleum co chevron usa inc atlantic 
richfield co citgo petroleum corp and bp america

a timber dealer accused of illegally 
exporting federal logs admitted that he sold the timber to japan 
but said he didnt know the wood had been cut from national forests 
they were not marked as forest service logs john j 
tortorelli of bellevue wash told a federal court jury on 
thursday 
tortorelli and his codefendant winston bentley of spokane 
wash each denied that they conspired to export federal logs 
illegally to japan two years ago i never entered into any such 
agreement i never conspired to i never even thought about it 
bentley said 
federal law forbids the export of raw logs cut from national 
forests intending the logs to be processed in us mills raw 
logs or unprocessed timber fetch a higher price than finished 
lumber on the export market 
federal officials have said this case may be the first time 
anyone has been prosecuted for violating the export ban which is 
designed to protect american jobs in mills 
the concern over exports has been heightened by timber shortages 
blamed for layoffs and sawmill closures 
if convicted the defendants each could be sentenced to 10 years 
in prison and fined 20000 
tortorelli is accused of arranging to buy about 160 truckloads 
of logs from sawmills and independent loggers in northwest montana 
north idaho and eastern washington in 1987 and 1988 then exporting 
those logs while knowing they had been cut from federal forests 
prosecutors say bentley assisted with some sale arrangements and 
routed some timber through a yard in mead wash 
assistant us attorney robert brooks asked tortorelli why he 
told a truck driver picking up the some of the logs to say they 
would be processed in a domestic mill 
tortorelli said if a buyer reveals that he is exporting the 
logs the seller automatically wants a much higher price 
in testimony earlier this week several loggers and sawmill 
operators who sold logs to tortorelli said they told him the logs 
had been cut from national forests others said some of the logs 
were marked with paint or us forest service brands 
tortorelli testified that he could not recall being told that 
the logs were cut from federal forests and that he dealt with many 
different buyers and sellers that handled private and federal 
timber 
crossexamination of tortorelli was to resume today final 
arguments in the trial were scheduled for monday

the rising temperatures that turned the 
december freeze into a januaryfebruary thaw are bound to end as 
soon as frigid air in the far north builds enough muscle says the 
agriculture departments weatherman 
the question at this point is exactly when and where the dike 
will break said norton d strommen chief meteorologist for the 
departments world agricultural outlook board 
meanwhile although most americans enjoy the midwinter warmth 
many farmers are apprehensive 
it reduces winter hardiness of the winter wheat crop 
strommen said thursday in an interview it promotes the early 
development of fruit buds and while we can benefit from the early 
growth of pastures it does set us up for frostrelated 
problems 
he also said very limited soil moisture supplies are being 
drawn on earlier than usual by the springlike warmth and the 
growth of pastures and winter wheat 
the joint agricultural weather facility operated by usda and the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported this week 
that last month ranked as the nations warmest january on record 
following the fourthcoldest december 
precipitation in january varied greatly showing a large 
contrast between the unusually wet south and the unusually dry west 
north central region the report said 
for example precipitation ratings showed wyoming had the third 
driest january since 1895 while south dakota had its sixth driest 
and north dakota had its eighth driest january 
by contrast alabama louisiana mississippi and oklahoma had 
one of the wettest januarys since 1895 
the last four months in the primary hard red winter wheat 
region in the central and southern plains have been extraordinarily 
dry the report said combined octoberjanuary precipitation 
across this region ranks 198990 as the seventh driest such period 
on record 
but strommen said there are some benefits to the warmer weather 
notably for livestock producers whose feeding and watering labors 
have been eased cattle and hogs gain weight better and there is 
minimal death losses from midwinter cold 
in december almost all the feed energy consumed by animals 
went to maintaining weights he said the january thaw took all 
that stress off that they had in december 
for weeks dominant highaltitude currents from the pacific have 
flowed across the northern part of the united states acting as a 
fence or dike against the savagely colder arctic air normally 
flowing down from canada 
theyre really holding in a building quantity of arctic air up 
over the pole strommen said eventually weve got to tap and 
release that cold air

a federal judges ruling that us courts have 
jurisdiction over manuel noriegas drug case has opened the way for 
the next battle defense efforts to win access to government 
secrets 
us district judge william hoevelers ruling came at a status 
conference thursday the first time noriega and his five 
codefendants appeared together 
though the new panamanian government has stripped him of his 
military rank noriega wore his fourstar generals uniform 
hoeveler ordered the case to proceed after rejecting defense 
arguments that noriega as a prisoner of war must be transferred 
to his homeland or a third country until an international tribunal 
determines his status under the geneva convention 
this court does have jurisdiction to proceed hoeveler said 
and we will 
william bryson us deputy solicitor general argued the judge 
has jurisdiction even though the government agreed to noriegas pow 
status 
defense attorney frank rubino strongly dissented saying the 
government was trying to stretch the geneva convention to justify 
what he described as the illegal invasion of panama and detention 
of noriega 
after the hearing rubino said he planned to ask the us 
supreme court to free noriega 
hoeveler agreed to rule in the next two weeks on an issue both 
sides agree is central to the case how us government secrets 
relating to noriega must be handled 
part of the expected defense strategy is to try to introduce 
material documenting links between the deposed panamanian leader 
and the cia and other intelligence agencies 
we believe a tremendous amount of exculpatory material is 
hidden in agencies that the government maintains said noriega 
attorney david lewis a new yorkbased expert on the classified 
information protection act 
we want to be able to go forward and we dont want the 
government to restrict that lewis said 
assistant us attorney james mcadams said he did not expect an 
avalanche of confidential documents he said the defense was 
exaggerating the amount of material at issue 
we conducted what we would call a very thorough and exhausting 
search mcadams said he estimated the secrecy issue could be 
settled by july 
lewis calling the case a megatrial said the government 
would need at least nine months to provide the information and for 
the defense to respond with less time he argued the trial itself 
could be interrupted frequently by appeals over unresolved secrecy 
issues 
to quote tina turner we can do it nice and easy or we can 
do it nice and rough lewis told the judge paraphrasing a line 
from the singers version of proud mary 
because of the secrecy issues all sides agreed that the march 5 
trial date is unrealistic noriegas attorneys estimated they would 
need up to two years to be ready while the prosecution said it 
could be go to trial by the end of the year 
no new trial date was set 
during the hearing noriega occasionally leaned over to talk to 
codefendant luis del cid who prosecutors say was one of his aides 
also attending were defendants luis saldarriaga daniel miranda 
eduardo pardo and the only one out on bond brian alden davidow 
whose attorney is seeking a separate trial ten other defendants 
are still at large 
in tampa fla meanwhile more than 250000 in drug profits 
traced to a tampabased smuggler who once described noriega as his 
partner was doled out thursday to lawenforcement agencies us 
attorney robert genzman said at a news conference 
the money came from assets forfeited by steven michael kalish a 
convicted drug runner who told a us senate subcommittee that 
noriega agreed to let him launder as much as 100 million a month 
through panama as long as noriega got his cut 
kalish said he paid noriega more than 1 million in bribes and 
agreed to pay him 3 million more 
after his arrest kalish struck a deal for leniency with federal 
prosecutors in a sentencing memorandum us attorneys said the 
1988 drug indictment against noriega wouldnt have been possible 
without kalishs help

committees are being considered but a spokesman said no 
decisions have been made on time place or topic 
velikhov made his proposal both as chairman of the supreme 
soviets defense panel and as chairman of the moscowbased 
foundation it was founded in 1988 with the aim of finding 
solutions to problems in such areas as international security the 
environment and human rights 
thursday marked the beginning of a 12day visit by members of 
the soviet legislatures defense panel to us military 
installations members of the house committee made a similar 
inspection tour of soviet military bases last august

democratic values in the soviet union is in the us national 
interest 
representatives of the international foundation said velikhov is 
asking the proposed joint hearings be based on a report written by 
members of the groups security committee 
the report reducing the dangers of accidental and 
unauthorized nuclear launch and terrorist attack alternatives to a

felling old forests in the american northwest 
may aggravate global warming by releasing millions of tons of 
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere according to a study published 
today 
mark harmon a researcher at the department of forest service at 
oregon state university said that even if new trees are planted to 
replace the old trees there is still a net gain in atmospheric 
carbon dioxide from the demise of the ancient forest 
the young forest simply doesnt store anywhere near as much 
carbon as the old forest said harmon a finding he said is the 
opposite of the conventional wisdom 
the scientist said more than half of the wood cut from old 
forests is burned or used in ways such as paper making that 
quickly puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere also large trees 
absorb carbon dioxide at about the same rate that decaying dead 
tree parts on the forest floor give it off a balance that new 
forests dont reach for more than two centuries 
harmon said he and his coinvestigators studied the effects of 
old forest harvesting on the greenhouse effect because weve been 
concerned that decisionmakers are going to make important policy 
decisions based on inaccurate armchair ecology 
carbon dioxide and some other gases in the atmosphere act as a 
blanket to trap heat given off by the earth this is called the 
greenhouse effect some experts believe that a surplus of carbon 
dioxide is causing the earth to slowly overheat and they warn that 
such a change could disrupt the global climate many scientists 
however disagree that the planet is warming up 
in a study published today in the journal science harmon 
reports that old growth forests areas that have never been logged 
capture and store much larger amounts of carbon from the 
atmosphere than younger forests 
he said many believe that the old trees aggravate the greenhouse 
effect because old forests are littered with dead branches leaves 
and other material that decays and puts carbon dioxide into the 
atmosphere 
but harmon said a computer study shows that an old forest with 
very large trees actually reaches a carbon equilibrium that 
neither adds nor subtracts from the total carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere 
when the old trees are cut down however the forest litter 
continues to decay giving off carbon and harmon said it takes new 
seedlings about 250 years to grow enough to reestablish the 
carbon equilibrium 
additionally he said that only about 45 percent of the wood 
harvested from old forests is turned into lumber or other building 
materials that store carbon for long periods much of the 
material is burned rots or is used for paper all of which release 
carbon into the atmosphere within a short time 
in the past century harmon said about 18 billion metric tons 
of carbon have been released into the atmosphere from harvesting of 
about 175 million acres of old growth in western oregon and 
washington 
land use changes such as ripping out old forests contribute 
only a fraction of the carbon dioxide that comes from the burning 
of fossil fuels the scientist said but harmon said that on a 
global basis the loss of forest land can be significant 
harmon estimated that of the total carbon added to the 
atmosphere in the past century by land use change 2 percent came 
from harvesting forests in oregon and washington even though the 
area covers only 017 percent of the earths land surface 
we have very poor records of land use change and how much 
carbon was in a forest before it was lost said harmon as a 
result these estimates have not been as precise as fossil fuel so 
i wouldnt be surprised if the actual value is substantially larger 
than we estimated 
the forest study was coauthored by harmon and william k ferrell 
of oregon state university and jerry f franklin of the university 
of washington science is the journal of the american association 
for the advancement of science

three years ago they threw stones at 
indian security men at the first sign of retaliation they would 
run for cover and flee into the narrow lanes of srinagar waving 
clenched fists as a gesture of defiance 
but today moslem militants campaigning for kashmirs 
independence have graduated to kalashnikov rifles and firebombs in 
battling an estimated 40000 indian soldiers in the strategic state 
intelligence reports say the militants most of them in their 
20s have acquired rocket launchers and even usmade stinger 
missiles 
india now faces the risk of fighting a prolonged guerrilla war 
in kashmir said a retired colonel of the indian army and like 
most other guerrilla war situations the odds are in favor of the 
terrorists he spoke on condition of anonymity 
over the years these terrorists have graduated into becoming 
real fighters not in the conventional sense but as guerrillas 
said jitendra narain saxena the directorgeneral of the 
jammukashmirs 40000member police force 
before the police could just scare them away but today they 
stand up and try to defy saxena said 
saxena would not discuss the reasons for the change of mood in 
kashmir where analysts say india faces the toughest challenge to 
its unity in the countrys 42 years of independence 
more than 80 people have been killed in the wave of separatist 
violence that began jan 20 with the arrests of more than 250 
people 
the killings and open defiance by the militants triggered a 
panic in the adminstration curfew was imposed for days the army 
was called out and foreign journalists expelled from the state 
curfew passes of local journalists were withdrawn and indian 
journalists working for foreign media were confined to their hotel 
jammukashmir home of 6 million people is indias only 
moslemmajority state 
nationwide moslems account for about 11 percent of the 
countrys 880 million people but in the kashmir valley the 
stronghold of the militants moslems make up 94 percent of the 35 
million people 
kashmir became part of the mogul empire when akbar invaded the 
area in 1586 the afghans annexed it in 1756 the sikhs came in 
1819 a hindu king took it over in 1846 
when britain divided the subcontinent in 1947 into islamic 
pakistan and hindudominated india kashmir was given the choice to 
either remain independent or join either of the two nations after 
initial hesitation the king joined india and triggered a pakistani 
armed invasion 
a brief war followed and india claims that of the states 88894 
square miles of territory pakistan is in illegal occupation of 
31572 square miles new delhi also alleges that pakistan gave away 
17094 square miles of territory to china when islamabad and 
beijing signed a boundary agreement 
intelligence reports attribute the guerrillas popularity to 
fear but many including some junior government officials and some 
kashmir police admit privately that even if they do not support 
the militants they do not oppose them either 
in kashmir today everyone even a 10yearold boy is in favor 
of independence said maulvi mohammad farooq the chief moslem 
priest of kashmir 
if police actions are not stopped i have to ask the people to 
join the armed struggle the 45yearold farooq said in an 
interview at his fortified home in srinagar 
the entire population has risen as one man against indian 
occupation said politician abdul ghani lone of the peoples 
conference party it looks as if the indian government wants to 
create peace in kashmir but that peace will be the peace of the 
graveyard 
gov jagmohan ruled out any threat to indias sovereignty 
the issue is very simple he said in a interview at his home 
guarded by indian troops manning light machine gun positions behind 
bunkers there was lack of economic development people are 
frustrated 
once we set things right kashmir will again become jannat 
heaven said jagmohan who uses only one name 
but the scene outside his home is different 
behind a graveyard in the old srinagar district 11yearold 
riaz sheikh holds his toy kalashnikov rifle and waits for his 
friends not to play but to discuss how to become moslem holy 
worriors 
before we played cricket but now we talk about how to 
liberate kashmir from india said riaz whose brother hamid 
sheikh a top militant leader was shot and wounded by the police 
why you want to talk to us he asked can you give me a 
gun

federal officials would gather data on hate 
crimes motivated by race religion sexual orientation or ethnic 
roots under legislation that is moving towards approval in congress 
if were going to curb crimes of hate we need to know their 
extent sen paul simon dill said thursday as the senate 
approved the bill 924 
the senate shrugged off complaints from sen jesse helms 
rnc that the measure fans the fires of the homosexual 
movement as it sent the bill back to the house which has already 
approved a slightly different version 
the bush administration supports the measure and so chances are 
good that it will be signed into law this year 
it also has support from civil rights ethnic and police groups 
concerned over what has been portrayed as a rising tide of hate 
crimes 
the bill would require the attorney general to keep statistics 
on crimes motivated by race religion sexual orientation and 
ethnicity the data would become part of justice department uniform 
crime reports 
under the plan the department would count murder nonnegligent 
manslaughter forcible rape aggravated assault simple assault 
intimidation arson and destruction damage or vandalism of 
property 
the justice department said in a may 1988 report that accurate 
information about the number of crimes involving bias against 
groups is not available 
these types of offenses are far more serious than comparable 
crimes that do not involve prejudice because they are intended to 
intimidate an entire group the report said 
simon told the senate there have been reports of a rising tide 
of hate crimes by neonazi skinheads and other groups but he 
said some observers also believe the problem is leveling off 
unofficial estimates of the cost of gathering the data have 
ranged from 1 1 million to 10 million annually the department 
says there would be little if any difficulty in making hate 
crimes part of the uniform crime reports 
urvashi vaid executive director of the national gay and lesbian 
task force said after the vote that the senate today sent a 
strong signal to the bigots and bashers that violence against 
lesbians and gay men is intolerable 
the human rights campaign fund which describes itself as the 
countrys largest homosexual lobby expressed surprise at the 
overwhelming support shown in the senate 
helms blasted the bill as the flagship of the homosexual and 
lesbian legislative agenda citing provisions that require data 
on crimes motivated by sexual orientation 
sponsors said all such crimes including ones directed against 
homosexuals should be included in the count sen orrin hatch 
rutah a leading supporter said he did not condone homosexual 
behavior but that he always opposes violent crimes against 
individuals 
theyre human beings too and they ought to be treated like 
human beings hatch said theyre citizens of this country and 
they ought to be treated like citizens of this country 
the senate overwhelmingly rejected a helms amendment to express 
the nonbinding sense that the homosexual movement threatens the 
strength and the survival of the american family as a basic unit of 
society and state sodomy laws should be enforced because they 
are in the best interest of public health 
it also said government should not provide discrimination 
protections on the basis of sexual orientation and school 
curriculums should not condone homosexuality as an acceptable 
lifestyle in american society 
but senate minority leader bob dole rkan rallied opposition 
to the amendment when he said it appears that the need for the 
national hate crimes statistics act has never been greater and 
thats what this is a statistics act its not about anybodys 
behavior 
besides helms those voting against the bill were sens gordon 
humphrey rnh trent lott rmiss and william armstrong 
rcolo not voting were sens christopher dodd dconn carl 
levin dmich alan simpson rwyo and malcolm wallop rwyo

sen dave durenberger defending his financial 
dealings before the senate ethics committee says he told the panel 
some decisions would be made differently if he could do it over 
again 
the minnesota republican met with the committee privately for an 
hour thursday afternoon at his request 
although questions about durenbergers conduct are still 
emerging the senator told reporters afterward the cloud of 
questions that has been hanging over my head since my 1988 
reelection campaign has finally started to clear today i have 
had the opportunity to address the issues in the proper forum the 
senate ethics committee 
he refused to answer questions from reporters after reading a 
brief statement 
durenberger said he told the panel he received approval from 
the appropriate official bodies for a book promotion 
arrangement that netted 100000 in speaking fees and for rent that 
he charged the senate for staying in his minneapolis condominium 
durenberger previously said the federal election commission 
approved his book promotion agreement and the senate rules and 
ethics committees sanctioned the reimbursement he received for the 
condominium 
the committee is investigating durenberger to determine if he 
should answer charges in the panels equivalent of a trial the 
committee gave no indication when it would finish its 
investigation said a durenberger aide 
the questions are whether durenberger broke senate rules by 
evading outside income limits when he made promotional speeches for 
the books improperly charged the senate for the condominium stays 
and received improper reimbursements for trips to boston that 
combined official appearances with visits to his marriage counselor 
the rules committee found last month durenberger improperly 
claimed reimbursement for staying in his condominium when the 
senate was out of session and durenberger repaid the senate 
11005 
the committee said there were other unspecified questions about 
the deal that the ethics committee would have to answer 
durenberger who is up for reelection in 1994 has apologized 
to minnesotans for what he says were mistakes in judgment still 
more than twothirds of respondents in two recent minnesota polls 
said he should resign if the committee finds significant wrongdoing 
i have accepted full responsibility for my actions and i have 
acknowledged that had i to do it all over again some decisions 
would be made differently durenberger said thursday 
accompanied by his lawyer jim hamilton and an aide 
durenberger made a lengthy presentation that took up much of 
the hourlong appearance before the committee thursday said his 
press secretary carrie collins 
meanwhile the star tribune of minneapolis disclosed wednesday 
that durenberger obtained 13 million in lowinterest unsecured 
loans from a minnesota bank where his cousin is a vice president 
many of the loans were at interest rates several points below prime 
lending rates 
durenberger said the story was a blatant distortion of the 
facts 
he said his loans were based on a normal longstanding 
relationship with the bank but neither he nor his staff have 
attempted to explain why he did not disclose three of the 23 loans 
to the senate including a shortterm 484000 loan he obtained in 
1988 
i guess i would say were looking into that collins said 
senate disclosure reports require the listing of any liabilities 
exceeding 10000 
minnesota republican chairman bob weinholzer said thursday that 
he expected state democrats to increase pressure for durenberger to 
resign because democratic gov rudy perpich could appoint a senator 
from his party to serve until an election 
weinholzer said durenberger told him last week he has 
absolutely no intentions of resigning unless something major comes 
along in an ethics committee report 
in april 1988 the ethics committee criticized durenberger for 
discussing an espionage case in public the previous year but it 
did not recommend disciplinary action

the imperial palace has chosen two paddies where 
sacred rice will be grown for a ritual that marks emperor 
akihitos first communion with the gods a mystical part of his 
ascension to the throne 
the ancient selection ceremony was criticized by several 
christian academic and leftist groups which say state backing of 
the communion rite violates japans constitution 
imperial ritualists dressed in flowing robes and black headgear 
gathered at three palace shrines thursday morning and divined 
auspicious locations for the paddies by burning sea turtle shells 
over charcoal 
an official of the imperial household agency which manages 
palace affairs said northeastern akita prefecture or state and 
western oita prefecture were chosen 
because of security concerns the exact location of the paddies 
is not expected to be announced until the rice is harvested in 
september 
police fear attacks by radical leftist groups which have 
announced they intend to disrupt akihitos coronation in november 
nearly two years after he actually became emperor on the death of 
his father emperor hirohito the leftist middle core faction 
claimed responsibility for launching projectiles at the home of 
akihitos younger brother last month 
by tradition one paddy must be to the east and one to the west 
of kyoto japans former capital the rice must go through an 
elaborate purification process before being used in the daijosai 
or great food offering ritual to be held after the lavish 
coronation ceremonies 
during the nightlong ritual tradition holds that a new emperor 
has his first communion with the gods of shinto japans indigenous 
religion 
banquets will be held for two nights after the rite and the 
government has said about 1000 dignitaries will be invited 
in the last such ceremony in 1928 hirohito offered rice to the 
gods at two shrines in kyoto akihitos daijosai ceremony will be 
held on the grounds of the imperial palace in tokyo but government 
officials say it will otherwise follow the example set by hirohito 
the palaces respect for precedent has led to criticism from 
several groups that claim the ceremony is a remnant of japans 
prewar emperorcentric nationalism 
they have thrown themselves back into the world of myth 
said tsutomu moriyama a spokesman for the national christian 
council an umbrella group for christians in japan from the 
constitutional viewpoint these preparations to deify the emperor 
are unforgivable 
it is clear that the government in planning the daijosai has 
ignored the principle that sovereignity lies with the people and 
not the emperor the rites violate the constitution said a 
statement issued by the historical studies association a 
nationwide group of historians and college professors 
at the urging of usled occupation authorities hirohito 
renounced imperial divinity soon after world war ii the current 
constitution omits references to the old godemperor concept and 
strips shinto of its official status the postwar constitution also 
guarantees the separation of religion and state 
a government committee recently released a report saying that 
although the daijosai has strong religious overtones it is 
public in nature and is extremely important as part of 
japanese culture 
the government has budgeted more than 58 million for akihitos 
coronation and the ceremony 
preparations for the coronation had to await a oneyear mourning 
period after hirohitos death of cancer on jan 7 1989 hirohito 
was 87

several lawmakers say sanctions that have 
damaged south africas economy probably wont be repealed until 
pretorias white government makes further concessions to the black 
majority 
but a top administration official speaking wednesday on 
condition he not be identified said south africa is likely to make 
enough progress in easing oppression against blacks over the next 
year to permit the lifting of sanctions 
this is a time when the united states can do the most good by 
waiting and watching said sen richard lugar rind the former 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee who supported 
sanctions initially 
south african president fw de klerks reforms important as 
they are do not meet all the conditions required to build the 
appropriate prenegotiations climate said rep howard wolpe 
dmich chairman of the house africa subcommittee 
rep dan burton rind the ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said he continues to oppose sanctions which he thinks 
have hurt black south africans more than the whites 
but he predicted the sanctions will not be changed until a lot 
more has been accomplished because of a prosanctions climate in 
congress 
the sanctions debate is likely to become more intense if de 
klerk continues to announce reforms in the whiteruled country 
president bush has said it is certainly time to review all 
policy when people move in the right direction 
in general there is agreement the sanctions congress imposed in 
1986 over president reagans veto harmed the countrys economy and 
took a psychological toll on the white minority 
stephen r lewis jr author of the economics of apartheid 
said international trade sanctions alone have probably resulted 
in a 2 billion loss annually to the south african economy 
but lewis president of carlton college in northfield minn 
said us sanctions were probably more of a blow psychologically 
because the united states has little economic leverage over the 
country 
all told there are about 123 american companies doing business 
in south africa employing roughly 1 percent of the populations 
the political significance of sanctions was very 
substantial said lewis saying it meant the south african 
government could no longer kid itself the united states would 
come down on its side 
but michael johns said that although sanctions increased 
pressure on the government they should be ended now to boost the 
nations economy and ease pressure on de klerks government from 
blacks and rightwing white groups 
randall robinson head of transafrica a lobbying group that 
encouraged sanctions said they have had more impact than any 
previous or current pressure 
south africas economy is weak because of a combination of 
factors he said including an international oil boycott other 
countries restrictions and the inefficiencies of apartheid 
south africas economy has grown at less than 2 percent annually 
in recent years compared with about 5 percent between 19501970 
lewis said 
they finally made an impact on whites said pauline baker of 
the carnegie endowment for international peace a think tank the 
economy was in irreversible decline 
us sanctions barred new american investment in south africa 
including bank loans to the government prohibited the import of 
south african iron steel coal and uranium and agricultural 
products including sugar prevented the united states from 
exporting computers to south africa banned all nuclear trade and 
halted landings by south african airways 
last week de klerk legalized the african national congress 
after three decades of guerrilla war against white rule and said 
he would soon free nelson mandela the anc leader imprisoned in 
1962

three slayings and a suspected suicide at the 
topsecret trident submarine base have raised questions of 
espionage and complaints that the navy has not conducted a complete 
investigation 
the intrigue is focused on a 23yearold submarine technician 
named shyam david drizpaul whose body was found last month in a 
vancouverarea motel about 180 miles south of the bangor trident 
submarine base 
navy investigators say they believe drizpaul killed two fellow 
submariners in the bangor bases barracks then killed a woman and 
wounded a man during a pawnshop robbery in nearby bremerton 
they claim drizpaul then drove to the motel and killed himself 
but a lawyer for drizpauls family family members and even a 
shipmate said the navys story doesnt make sense 
attorney larry scruggs jr of milwaukee who traveled to the 
base to investigate the shootings noted that drizpaul had a 
sensitive position working on the weapons systems aboard the uss 
michigan that drizpaul was a computer whiz and his personal 
computer is missing and that he was killed by a single bullet 
through his forehead which he said was unusual for a suicide 
scruggs also said he has evidence of another person being 
involved in the plot but he would give no details not even the 
persons gender 
i think he was either murdered or compelled to do those 
things scruggs said of the slayings drizpaul had high 
clearance and my indication was that clearance was extremely high 
extremely critical 
maybe the thing fell apart and people began to panic and 
couldnt accept the results there is one person who can answer 
those questions he said referring to the other individual 
drizpauls relatives in milwaukee said drizpaul was an 
intelligent and responsible person who did not fit the description 
of a killer 
nothing makes sense there are a lot of questions that havent 
been answered said an uncle yoganand kumar whats going on 
what are they trying to cover up were not saying he didnt do it 
were saying tell us what happened 
at drizpauls funeral last month petty officer paul gamache of 
osseo wis who escorted drizpauls body from washington to 
milwaukee told mourners that drizpauls coworkers were surprised 
by the allegations 
gamache who knew drizpaul for 18 months said the navys 
allegations about drizpaul did not really seem like the guy we 
knew he always performed every job ever asked of him in a very 
professional manner he took pride in his work 
scruggs said the circumstances around the shootings of two 
sailors in a bangor barrack were unusual the sailors identified 
as david allen parker 21 of san diego and 18yearold scott 
anthony seely of north ridgeville ohio had been shot in the 
head and were found about fifteen feet apart he said 
whoever was shot second would have heard the first gunshot but 
investigators found no signs of trauma or struggle in either 
victim scruggs said 
sometime after the shooting bangor gate guards detained 
drizpaul for driving while intoxicated and took from him a 9mm 
automatic pistol 
navy ballistics reports should confirm next week whether that 
gun killed parker and seely said banger spokesman lt cmdr keith 
arterburn 
the navy has refused to respond to scruggs questions 
allan michaels 28 identified drizpaul from photographs as the 
man who wounded him and fatally shot his sister julie lynn 
tuscher 24 in the pawn shop where they worked i dont know how 
much clearer that can be arterburn said 
but scruggs said michaels identification was too detailed 
he described him exactly the same way it was printed in the 
newspaper neatly trimmed mustache give me a break 
the morning after the sailors were shot police and navy 
authorities said drizpaul allegedly drove to bremerton in one of 
the dead sailors cars and shot tuscher and michaels while trying 
to take another gun 
arterburn said 35 investigators are still working on the case 
the drizpaul incident is the latest of several deaths close to 
the base two navy servicemen committed suicide in the last 13 
months and one crewman faces charges of killing an elderly couple 
north of seattle 
the shootings have raised questions about the navys training 
arterburn said all submarine crew members undergo psychological 
testing before being assigned to duty he also said those who work 
around nuclear weapons are monitored by the defense department 
we all believe this to be a real tragedy arterburn said of 
the string of shootings weve lost shipmates its one of those 
things that shocks you but you have to keep on

condoms should be distributed free to young users 
of crack cocaine say researchers who found that many such youths 
sell sex for drugs or engage in sexual practices that increase 
their risk of catching aids 
the researchers reported in todays jornal of american medical 
association that 76 percent of the subjects in their study were 
worried or somehwat worried about catching hiv the aids virus 
the researchers viewed the degree of worry by the respondents as 
positive 
the kids were worried about contracting aids some aids 
education has gotten through said robert fullilove who led a 
team of researchers that questioned 222 young black crack users in 
san francisco and oakland calif 
fullilove said that he and his colleagues recommended a campaign 
of widespread distribution of condoms that might make it possible 
for even the worried implusive crack user to have safe sexual 
encounters 
crack is such a deadly thing many people think the only 
thing you can do is watch the community commit suicide fullilove 
said in a telephone interview thursday we dont see it that way 
at all 
threefourths of the admitted crack users ages 13 to 19 said 
they engaged in sexual practices that increased their risk of 
catching hiv the researchers said 
fiftyfive youths or 25 percent reported exchanging sex for 
money or drugs a practice equally common among boys and girls the 
researchers found 
other alarming trends among the 140 boys and 82 girls surveyed 
were 
just 59 percent reported ever using a condom and just 23 
percent said they had used a condom in their most recent sexual 
encounter 
twentyseven percent of boys and 4 percent of girls said they 
had more than 10 sexual partners during the previous year 
fortyone percent had a history of sexually transmitted 
diseases mostly gonorrhea 
fiftyone percent said they had engaged in sex while under the 
influence of crack 
twentynine percent said the following statement was true of 
them i dont usually know ahead of time if im going to have sex 
it just happens 
fullilove conceded the distribution of condoms is not a panacea 
to the spread of aids 
obviously it would work best in a much more comprehensive 
program teaching everything from be responsible to this drug 
crack is dangerous he said 
the national conference of catholic bishops is opposed to 
distributing condoms in a statement issued in november the bishops 
said condoms were technically unreliable and fostered a false 
sense of security that actually leads to a greater spread of 
disease 
father gregory coiro a spokesman for los angeles archbishop 
roger mahony who led the bishops ad hoc committee on the aids 
statement said thursday this notion of safe sex is a myth its 
a fraud 
besides encouraging sexual encounters that are immoral coiro 
said the failure rate of condoms can be as high as 50 percent in 
anal intercourse one of the main ways the disease spreads 
crack use coupled with exchanging sex for the drug has been 
cited as a factor in the recent increase in sexually transmitted 
disease oberved in many us urban areas according to fullilove 
who led the study for the university of california at san 
franciscos center for aids prevention studies 
subjects for the study were questioned by interviewers who were 
familiar with drug dealers and users in known areas of crack 
activity the researchers said 
the interviewers went to those neighborhoods and questioned 
youths who approached them either requesting or offering a sale of 
crack a highly potent smokable form of cocaine that is both 
inexpensive and highly addictive

the government and mining industry rejected a 
safety proposal in the early 1950s that would have protected 
uranium miners from lung cancer and other respiratory diseases 
says a former government scientist 
the atomic energy commission disclaimed responsibility they 
were not responsible for radiation protection until after the ore 
reached the mills dr victor e archer told the senate committee 
on labor and human resources 
the mine operators rejected it because it would cost them too 
much to ventilate the mines he said the states reflected 
the mine operators opinion pointing out that they had no 
expertise in radiation safety and no money for extra mine 
inspectors 
he said all three groups justified their inaction by arguing 
that it was not clear that there was a radiation hazard in us 
mines despite high levels measured in us mines and the lung 
cancer experience of miners in central europe 
archer an epidemiologist with the us public health service in 
utah in the 1950s said the safety proposal came from duncan 
holaday an industrial hygiene engineer with the health service 
holaday proposed in 1952 and 1953 that a maximum radon exposure 
limit be set and that it be enforced through mine ventilation 
archer said 
the safety measures would have cost a nickel per pound of 
uranium he said 
sen orrin hatch rutah has written legislation that would 
compensate victims of radiation exposure through uranium mining 
from 19471971 or aboveground nuclear tests at the nevada test 
site in the 1950s and 60s 
the level of their exposure was in large part due to the 
governments unconscionable failure to properly care for or warn 
these victims hatch said 
uranium mines are located in new mexico wyoming utah and 
colorado 
full protection began only when federal authorities took over 
regulation with the occupational safety and health administration 
in 1971 and the mine safety and health administration six years 
later archer said 
hatch said legislation which would create a 100 million trust 
fund is necessary because courts have rejected individual claims 
on the grounds of government exemption from liability 
hatch said he expected the full committee to complete action on 
the bill when it meets feb 28 
rep wayne owens dutah has filed similar legislation in the 
house he said he expected the house to complete action within six 
weeks 
the government carried out more than 100 aboveground tests at 
the nevada test site between 1951 and 1958 according to hatchs 
office

a federal judge says he wont consider 
national security and diplomatic implications in deciding whether 
former president reagan should turn over some 33 diary excerpts to 
john poindexter 
reagan invoked executive privilege monday in an attempt to avoid 
supplying the diaries to his former national security adviser who 
is scheduled to go on trial feb 20 on charges of conspiracy 
obstructing congress and making false statements in the irancontra 
scandal 
however the bush administration did not join in reagans move 
the privilege relating to national security foreign affairs 
and burdensomeness considerations is that of the incumbent rather 
than the former president us district court judge harold 
greene said in a fivepage order thursday 
in the absence of a claim of executive privilege by the 
incumbent president the interests of the current presidency will 
not receive the benefit of the higher standard of review greene 
wrote 
reagans claim to executive privilege is based on the 
constitutionally protected privacy of his diaries his lawyers 
said monday 
the justice department said wednesday that it would review 
secret proffers that poindexter has submitted to the court before 
the bush administration decides whether to claim executive 
privilege 
greene ordered that three such court filings by poindexter be 
turned over to reagan and the justice department by friday 
they include a june 12 filing seeking classified material and a 
sept 18 statement seeking permission to obtain material from 
reagan and president bush the third document is a jan 8 memo by 
poindexter explaining why documents subpoenaed from reagan are 
important to his defense 
greene ordered poindexter to supply the secret court filings so 
that reagan and the justice department can respond to poindexters 
demands for documents the judge said in december that he would 
follow such a procedure if executive privilege were invoked 
in the watergate scandal the supreme court ordered president 
nixon to produce white house tape recordings he had been trying to 
shield invoking executive privilege nixon said confidential 
conversations between a president and his close advisers should not 
be disclosed 
but the supreme court said a generalized interest in 
confidentiality cannot prevail over the fair administration 
of criminal justice

a judge said he may reverse himself and permit 
joseph hazelwoods defense to allege that government negligence 
not recklessness by the exxon valdez captain caused the nations 
worst oil spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone reopened the question after 
he had ruled thursday that such a theory could not be advanced by 
the defense 
defense attorney dick madson said in his opening statement that 
the us coast guard monitors werent watching their radar screen 
and failed in their duty to notify hazelwood that his 987foot 
tanker was heading for disaster at bligh reef 
a coast guard traffic monitor civilian employee gregory taylor 
testified thursday that part of his job was to watch the radar 
screen for trouble and communicate with tankers if a problem was 
imminent he also said he was to let people know what was going 
on to make things easier 
he said he spoke with hazelwood some time before the exxon 
valdez disaster and discussed ice conditions in the valdez narrows 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating 
a vessel while intoxicated if convicted he faces up to seven 
years and three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
most of the testimony in hazelwoods weekold trial has focused 
on whether the captain was drunk when the exxon valdez ran aground 
early march 24 the spill spewed more than 10 million gallons of 
north slope crude killing thousands of birds fish and other 
wildlife and blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline 
taylor and another traffic monitor have said the exxon valdez 
was in a hazy area at the edge of their radar monitor and may not 
have been visible before it smashed into a rocky reef 
johnstone initially ruled the defense couldnt use a theory of 
government negligence but later said he may reverse himself 
what the defense seems to be saying johnstone said is 
were not reckless we didnt create the problem the government 
created the problem the more i think about it the more i think 
the defense should be able to show they didnt create it the 
government did im reconsidering it 
the prosecution which says the accident was all hazelwoods 
fault tried to block such testimony saying if hazelwood wanted to 
claim he was not reckless he could testify on his behalf 
johnstone suggested this might force the defendant to testify 
when he would not otherwise do so 
in another ruling johnstone decided that jurors will not be 
told that taylor the coast guard monitor tested positive for 
marijuana two days after the grounding he did not immediately rule 
on whether a second monitors alcohol test would be admitted in 
evidence 
i find the inquiry about this marijuana has nil probative 
value and is far outweighed by the invasion of mr taylors 
privacy johnstone said in other words its a red herring 
documents filed in the case showed that bruce blandford the 
second traffic monitor showed a bloodalcohol level of 203 
percent 15 hours after the tanker went aground assistant district 
attorney brent cole said blandford went home after the accident and 
began drinking 
there is absolutely no evidence that mr blandford was under 
the influence of intoxicating liquor at any time during his 
shift said cole who conceded that in a later test blandford 
also showed a trace of morphine in his urine 
he said there was no evidence taylor was under the influence of 
marijuana the night of the crash traces of marijuana can remain in 
the bloodstream months after its use

government officials say the effort to save 
the american bald eagle from extinction has been so successful that 
the national symbol may be taken off the endangered list 
the eagle which was threatened with extinction in the 1960s 
partly because of contamination from the pesticide ddt would 
remain under protection of federal law but its status would be 
lowered officials said thursday 
we are not considering removing the bald eagle from the 
protection of the endangered species act said john turner 
director of the us fish and wildlife service 
turner said the agency was gathering additional data on eagle 
populations before making a formal recommendation to the interior 
department to lower the status of the eagle from endangered to 
threatened 
but the proposal has raised concerns among some 
environmentalists 
the improvements in eagle numbers may be only temporary 
because eagle habitat is still being destroyed at an unprecedented 
rate said m rupert cutler president of defenders of wildlife 
cutler said in some parts of the country such as the great 
lakes area and some coastal areas the eagle remains in danger 
because of pesticides and toxins and development is eating up 
eagle territory elsewhere 
the american eagle was placed under protection of federal law in 
1967 after its population had been declining since the 1940s 
largely because the widespread use of the pesticide ddt interfered 
in its reproductive process 
the environmental protection agency ordered a halt to the use of 
ddt in 1972 
from an estimated low not counting birds in alaska of only 400 
nesting pairs in the early 1960s their number increased to more 
than 2660 nesting pairs in 1989 the interior department said 
turner said four of the five government recovery programs in the 
country are showing eagle population figures that exceed numbers 
that would warrant reducing the status of the bird from endangered 
to threatened 
the bald eagle is listed as endangered in 43 states and 
threatened in five others the bald eagle is not under federal 
protection in alaska where the population is thriving with more 
than 30000 birds 
turner said his agency would review the bald eagle population 
figures when the latest data comes in before making a determination 
whether to lower its status to threatened in the 43 states

lord maclean the former chief official of queen 
elizabeth iis household and organizer of the 1981 wedding of 
prince charles has died his family announced today he was 73 
maclean died thursday at hampton court palace a former royal 
residence in london where he had been chief steward since 1985 
the announcement gave no cause of death 
the scottish baron became lord chamberlain in 1971 before he 
retired from the post in 1984 he had established a reputation as a 
perfectionist in royal ceremonies while overseeing the queens 
household 
the wedding of prince charles the queens eldest son and lady 
diana spencer in st pauls cathedral was a highlight of his term 
in a spontaneous gesture princess diana kissed him before a 
train carried the newlyweds away on their honeymoon 
maclean served as a scots guards infantry officer in world war 
ii fighting in france belgium the netherlands and germany after 
the war he became a sheep and cattle farmer 
in 1959 he became leader of the boy scouts in britain and the 
commonwealth he went on to revolutionize the staid image of the 
movement founded by lord badenpowell in 1908 adding sports such 
as gliding and cave diving to traditional scouting activities he 
retired as chief scout in 1975 
macleans first ceremonial assignment as lord chamberlain was 
the 1972 funeral of the duke of windsor who as king edward viii 
abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry american divorcee wallis 
simpson 
the assignment was difficult because of the bad feeling 
engendered by the abdication among other members of the royal 
family but maclean was judged to have handled the funeral 
arrangements with great skill 
royalty watchers noted with approval that maclean did not bow 
when he said farewell to the dukes widow as she left 
maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of queen 
elizabeth ii and her husband prince philip that year 
his job as lord chamberlain sometimes involved odd 
responsibilities he once had to advise the queen whether she 
should keep her centuriesold legal right to possession of every 
whale and sturgeon washed up on the british coast after some 
deliberation maclean advised her to renounce it saying it might 
prove a nuisance 
there was no immediate word on funeral arrangements 
he is survived by his wife and their son and daughter

aids spread at its slowest rate in the united 
states last year as fewer homosexual and bisexual men developed the 
disease and drugs delayed symptoms in people already infected 
federal officials said 
but aids is spreading faster among heterosexuals newborn 
babies women and southerners the federal centers for disease 
control reported thursday 
the cdc reported 35238 new cases of aids or acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in 1989 compared with 32196 in 1988 
that 9 percent increase is easily the slowest since the aids 
spread began in early 1981 for example aids was up 34 percent in 
1988 and 60 percent in 1987 
this is somewhat of a continuing trend said dr ruth 
berkelman chief of aids surveillance for the atlantabased cdc 
of the new aids cases reported last year 56 percent were among 
homosexual and bisexual males but the cases among gay and bisexual 
men were up just 8 percent over 1988 levels while 
heterosexualcontact cases just 4 percent of the total were up 
27 percent over the year before 
i think the leveling off reflects both a reduction in the 
number of new infections among homosexual and bisexual men and 
also the introduction of some effective therapies such as the drug 
azt in 1987 delaying the onset of aids itself among infected 
persons ms berkelman said 
in 1989 547 cases of aids transmission from mothers to newborns 
were reported up 17 percent from 1988 and while females made up 
just 3931 of the 35238 cases last year that was an increase of 
11 percent over 1988 the number of aids cases among males last 
year was up 9 percent from the preceding year

lowerincome mothers dont seem to bounce back 
from the anemia common in early pregnancy as well as other women 
and that puts their babies at higher risk of premature delivery and 
fetal death a new report says 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
a 1987 survey of lowerincome women showed that 38 percent of 
blacks and 19 percent of whites in the third trimester of pregnancy 
had hemoglobin levels indicating anemia 
during the second trimester 6 percent of white women and 18 
percent of black women were anemic in the first three months of 
pregnancy 4 percent and 13 percent respectively were anemic 
among pregnant women who receive sufficient iron hemoglobin 
levels normally decrease early in pregnancy then increase through 
the third trimester to near prepregnancy levels the 
atlantabased cdc said 
for the women in the lowincome survey the failure to attain 
prepregnancy levels during the third trimester suggests that many 
of these women were iron deficient during pregnancy 
the survey results mean many lowincome women have poor iron 
nutrition both before and during pregnancy the cdc said 
anemia during pregnancy increases a womans risk of premature 
delivery and increases the childs chances of low birth weight and 
fetal death the cdc said 
nationwide about 5 percent of nonpregnant childbearingage 
women have anemia the cdc said 
the racial differences may be related to a greater risk for 
iron deficiency in black women the cdc said but the 
explanation for the difference observed in this analysis is 
unclear 
the findings came from the cdcs 1987 pregnancy nutrition 
surveillance system which studied anemia during pregnancy among 
more than 68000 lowerincome women in 13 states most of them 
enrolled in the women infants and children wic food program

the southern california oil spill might have 
been avoided if the 811foot american trader had been equipped with 
a double hull and double bottom said state officials and shipping 
experts 
a number of officials speculated thursday that a large swell 
caused the american trader to fall on its own anchor wednesday 
ripping open a 3foot hole while the ship maneuvered alongside an 
offshore pipeline 
weve always recommended that this design change be looked 
at said peter douglas executive director of the state coastal 
commission if the information is born out that this tanker 
lifted up and came down on its own anchor doublehulling the 
vessel may well have prevented the spill 
the spill off huntington beach brought to a head debate over 
requiring the design change on tankers opposed by many oil 
officials because of the higher cost and arguable safety advantages 
even some oil industry executives acknowledged that 
doublehulling and doublebottoming could have prevented this 
spill a 1985 spill from a grounded arco tanker in port angeles 
harbor wash and the devastating exxon valdez spill in alaska 
the double hull in this case could have avoided the spill 
and our own spill said jerry aspland president of arco marine 
inc and a former ship captain experienced in offshore moorings 
but aspland and morris croce a chevron usa executive and former 
ship captain said the doublehull doublebottom construction had 
important drawbacks 
if for example a doublehull ship hits rocks at full speed it 
could be more difficult to handle because the extra steel makes for 
a bigger messier hole they said the space between the two hulls 
can fill with water making the ship less buoyant 
these considerations have got be addressed before one jumps to 
concluding that the double hull double bottom is the solution to 
everything croce said 
several panels are studying the doublebottom doublehull 
issue including the american academy of sciences which set to 
release a report this summer many oil companies said they would 
strongly consider the academys findings 
mike murphy vice president for operations at american trading 
transportation co inc operator of the american trader was 
noncommittal when asked at a news conference thursday whether a 
double hull might have prevented the spill 
he said that as a shipping company official he had mixed 
feelings about the doublehull issue 
the cost is one issue but there are other issues he 
said refusing to elaborate 
the senate and the house have passed differing oil liability 
bills that a conference committee is now blending into a measure 
both can approve by the march 24 anniversary of the exxon valdez 
spill 
the main sticking point is over double bottoms and double hulls 
which the house wants to see on all tankers calling at us ports 
with oil or hazardous materials within seven and 15 years 
respectively the senate bill calls for further study which is the 
position the oil industry prefers 
on wednesday the house voted 37637 to instruct the conferees 
to include the hullbottom provision in the bill though 
nonbinding the vote was taken to illustrate the strength of 
support for the provision in the house

thursdays close of 14550 yen it opened the day at 14508 yen and 
ranged between 14465 and 14515 yen 
the us currencys lower start in tokyo followed its downswing 
in new york thursday where it closed at 14532 yen

the yen is getting slightly stronger against the dollar as 
investors buy the yen against the mark said a dealer with the 
bank of tokyo speaking on condition of anonymity 
concerns about the implications of a proposal to unify the two 
german monetary systems along with profittaking helped push the 
mark lower traders said 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 21437 points thursday fell 22810 points or 
06 percent to close at 3728814 
trading on the market has been light since the beginning of this 
week in anticipation of japans upcoming parliamentary elections 
traders said a lack of trading focus was another element that 
has been discouraging buying interest there also was growing 
expectation in the market that the bank of japan will raise its 
official discount rate soon after the feb 18 elections traders 
said 
traders said indexlinked trading moved the market as most 
investors avoided dealing due to concern about the outcome of the 
elections where the governing liberal democrats face a possible 
loss of their lower house majority thin trading makes the market 
more vulnerable to indexlinked buying they said 
volume on the markets first section was estimated at 350 
million shares the lowest daily volume since last august an 
estimated 430 million shares changed hands on the first section on 
thursday 
both the stock and currency markets will be closed monday for

the head of the us central command says the 
most serious threats to us interests in the persian gulf are 
regional conflicts and the extensive acquisition of weapons by iran 
and iraq 
army gen h norman schwarzkopf told the senate armed services 
committee on thursday that although iran and iraq agreed to a cease 
fire in august 1988 the two countries have never signed a peace 
treaty 
this no peaceno war situation has caused both sides to pursue 
rearmament programs schwarzkopf said while each nation is 
purchasing more lethal weapons the balance of power is 
dramatically in favor of iraq 
under questioning from sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
armed services panel schwarzkopf said the soviet union has been 
supplying modern equipment directly to iraq 
in addition unbelievable amounts of modern equipment is 
flowing into afghanistan on a monthly basis the commander said 
based on this information the united states has changed its 
strategy altering its military plans for a regional conflict 
rather than a soviet invasion of iran 
the defense planning guidance a classified report the military 
leaders use to plan troop levels weapons purchases and bases for 
19921997 which was described this week in published reports 
reflects the change that schwarzkopf described

kansas lawmakers say unexpected opposition has 
convinced them to drop a proposal to rename washington dulles 
international airport after dwight d eisenhower 
rep pat roberts had planned to introduce a resolution thursday 
asking the regional airport authority to change the name of the 
airport located 25 miles west of the nations capital to eisenhower 
international airport to honor eisenhower in the centennial year 
of his birth 
but the suggestion drew expected opposition from area 
businessmen and the family of the late john foster dulles who 
served as secretary of state in eisenhowers administration it was 
an executive order by eisenhower in 1959 that named the airport 
after dulles 
from the outset we had no desire whatsoever to take away from 
the career of john foster dulles or to cause any problem said 
roberts 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan also received criticism 
after he introduced a similar resolution shortly after congress 
convened last month 
the metropolitan washington airports authority operates both

bombs exploded at a post office and on a 
parked bus today prompting authorities to tighten security in an 
attempt to halt moslem separatist violence in the northern kashmir 
region 
no one was hurt or killed in the blasts but state authorities 
later imposed a curfew and banned all public assembly including 
friday prayer services forcing tens of thousands of moslem sabbath 
worshipers to stay indoors 
moslem militants have been demanding for more than four decades 
that jammukashmir state break away from predominantly hindu india 
the latest flareup erupted last month with clashes between 
indian security forces and the militants and at least 82 people 
have been killed officials say 
a bomb exploded in a bus parked at the city terminal adjacent 
to the tourist information center officials said two other buses 
were damaged but no one was hurt they said 
another bomb exploded in a neighborhood post office but there 
were no casualties said the district magistrate of srinagar 
ghulam abbas 
most of the victims have been protesters shot while defying a 
curfew imposed jan 20 by government forces to stem rising violence 
in recent days authorities had relaxed the curfew during 
daytime hours but it was reimposed following the bomb blasts 
after moslems were told they would not be allowed to attend 
services the citys chief moslem priest denounced the decision and 
called on moslem leaders worldwide to force the indian government 
to allow the gatherings 
i strongly condemn the antiislamic act of state authorities 
to impose day curfew consistently on fridays for the last two 
months to make jumma friday prayers impossible moulvi mohammad 
farooq said in a statement 
kashmir once a princely state was divided between india and 
pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end 
of british colonial rule in 1947 srinagar and the surrounding 
areas of the valley became part of jammukashmir indias only 
predominantly moslem state 
sixtyfour percent of the states 5 million people are moslems 
but nationwide moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million 
population 
kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with 
pakistan which claims kashmir because of its predominant moslem 
population but now demand independence and the status of a neutral 
country 
india routinely blames neighoring pakistan of arming training 
and supporting the militants pakistan denies the charge but says 
the kashmiri people have a right to selfdetermination 
india and pakistan have fought two wars over the region

tel aviv teenagers from a nearby collective farm gave him a white 
dove which he symbolically freed 
he then shook hands with the director of the prison and said 
lehitraot hebrew for until we meet again 
nathan 63 was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading 
guilty to meeting arafat and other palestine liberation 
organization activists in tunisia in 1988 he entered eyal prison 
oct 10 and the penalty was reduced by two months for good 
behavior

the israeli siege of beirut in a unsuccessful attempt to gain 
freedom for a captured israeli soldier 
he said he was willing to risk another prison sentence because 
this is my way of fighting

was jailed 
i was put in a prison because of a law which is an 
undemocratic law which would not be accepted anywhere in the 
world nathan said i will do everything in my power in order 
to continue my struggle to change that law 
among those greeting nathan was peace activist latif dori who 
also has met with plo officials dori carried a placard with a

cbs news humorist andy rooney his future 
uncertain after a threemonth suspension without pay denies he 
made racial comments attributed to him in a gay magazine and said 
he wants to return to 60 minutes 
cbs news president david burke told rooney in a meeting that cbs 
would not tolerate racist remarks according to a statement from 
burke who did not return phone calls for further comment on the 
suspension 
rooney deined making the comments but i guess burke believes 
the person who said i said it rooney said 
rooney was interviewed by chris bull a reporter with the 
advocate a biweekly magazine based in los angeles the article was 
to be published today 
rooney has worked in news and entertainment at cbs for 40 years 
and has been the resident humorist at 60 minutes since 1978 
in a brief phone interview he declined to say whether he 
thought burkes action was fair but he later said in a statement 
the controversy put burke in a difficult position and i accepted 
his offer of suspension rather than to permanently end my career at 
cbs 
rooneys suspension is immediate he wont be seen this sunday 
in his usual 60 minutes slot a spokesman for the program said 
also thursday network officials were quoted as saying 
anchorwoman kathleen sullivan of cbs this morning was being 
taken off the program which has been rated consistently below 
morning abc and nbc shows sullivan could not be reached for 
comment 
rooney was quoted as saying that most people are born with 
equal intelligence but blacks have watered down their genes 
because the less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most 
children they drop out of school early do drugs and get 
pregnant 
rooney denied making the slur it is a knownothing statement 
which i abhor he said 
rooney won his first emmy award in 1968 for his script for a 
special program about blacks black history lost stolen or 
strayed which was narrated by bill cosby 
former cbs anchorman walter cronkite said rooney a friend since 
the two were correspondents in world war ii was not a racist 
cronkite said his more outrageous comments may offend some 
people from time to time but any suggestions that such a rare 
journalistic voice should be silenced indicates a dangerous 
weakness in our pluralistic society 
the article in which rooney also discussed homosexuals was 
entitled andy we hardly knew ye and had a subtitle and 
now a few homophobic minutes with andy rooney 
rooneys suspension came two years after cbs fired jimmy the 
greek snyder as an nfl today commentator after he said blacks 
were better athletes than whites because they were bred that 
way during slavery 
in his statement burke said that rooneys future with cbs will 
be discussed at the end of the suspension 
i have made it clear that cbs news cannot tolerate such 
remarks or anything that approximates such comments burke said 
mr rooney has expressed his dismay that the values of cbs news 
have been called into question and offers his deepest apologies to 
any in our society who are given offense 
rooney said he would continue writing his twiceweekly 
syndicated humor column which he said is distributed to about 260 
newspapers 
bull the reporter said his quotations of rooney taken down 
during a phone interview three weeks ago were accurate he did not 
tape the interview 
on wednesday benjamin hooks director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people called the 
purported remarks illinformed and racist 
hooks praised cbs for moving so quickly but said the naacp did 
not wish to rush in judgment and we will insist that there be a 
further and thorough investigation 
new york mayor david dinkins called cbs to register shock 
according to a spokesman later dinkins said gay men and 
lesbians as well as africanamericans are justified in their 
outrage about both mr rooneys comments and his subsequent 
attempts to explain them away 
rooney previously has gotten into hot water with homosexual 
groups because of a remark he made in a dec 28 cbs special a 
year with andy rooney 1989 
in that show he said that many of the ills which kill us are 
selfinduced and then cited too much alcohol too much food 
homosexual unions cigarettes

israeli officials today praised east germanys 
decision to acknowledge a share of responsibility for the holocaust 
but said they want practical steps before forging ties with that 
country 
in a letter released thursday prime minister hans modrow of 
east germany recognized that his people bore some of the 
responsibility for the deaths during the holocaust he also pledged 
material support for the victims of nazi persecution but did 
not elaborate 
michael shilo an israeli foreign ministry adviser on diaspora 
affairs said today we have to chew a little bit on the 
wording of modrows declaration but obviously it is a beginning i 
dont think we have ever heard before this kind of a declaration 
from east germany 
israel and east germany never had formal ties because of east 
germanys denial of responsibility for the holocaust in which an 
estimated 6 million jews were killed by nazi germany 
east germany has maintained it was a new state created in 1949 
by communists and could not accept blame for crimes committed by 
the third reich in world war ii communists also suffered 
persecution under the nazis 
however in his letter addressed to edgar bronfman president of 
the world jewish congress modrow said east germany recognizes 
the responsibility of the entire german people for the past 
this is a consequence of the deep guilt of hitler fascism 
which committed terrible crimes against the jewish people in the 
name of the german people modrow said 
the daily jerusalem post today reported a similar letter was 
sent to the israeli government and that its text was approved in 
last weeks talks between the two countries in copenhagen denmark 
those discussions were described as a preparatory meeting to 
discuss establishment of ties 
israel followed the talks with a statement saying establishing 
relations would be linked to the question of the acceptance by 
east germany of its share in the moral and historical 
responsibility for nazi crimes against the jews 
shilo who attended the talks in copenhagen welcomed modrows 
statement in an israel radio interview today 
asked whether israel could now establish diplomatic relations 
with east germany shilo said a verbal declaration is just a 
beginning a verbal declaration should be backed up by some 
tangible deeds in terms of education in school curriculum and 
maybe in legislation and some other things 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu noted east germanys 
shift in position came as speculation increased about uniting 
germany which was split in the aftermath of world war ii israeli 
leaders have expressed fears of unification 
west germany has accepted blame for the crimes of nazi germany 
and paid 43 billion in reparations to holocaust survivors and 
their families over the years 
israel singer secretarygeneral of the world jewish congress 
said his group is now likely to handle the issue of reparations 
from east germany

a bill creating a special commission with subpoena 
powers to investigate the way the media and police handled events 
unfolding from the shooting of carol stuart won support from 
several lawmakers and the governor 
if this thing continues and if there is no cleansing of the 
wound a lot of people are going to be hurt state sen bill 
owens of boston said at a hearing thursday before a joint judiciary 
committee 
backers of the bill said that a study is needed to determine why 
police focused on a black suspect in the initial investigation and 
why reports about the investigation were leaked to the media 
the bill would establish an 11member commission that could meet 
in secrecy much like a grand jury 
charles stuart originally told investigators that he and his 
pregnant wife were shot by a black mugger while leaving a 
childbirth class mrs stuart died of her wounds and the couples 
son born prematurely after the shooting died later 
stuart apparently committed suicide last month after 
investigators learned his story was a hoax and that he had plotted 
to kill his wife 
gov michael s dukakis said he supports the bill the 
creation of a commission would allow us to step back and look at 
the larger picture he said in a letter to the committee 
members of bostons black community criticized the way police 
handled the investigation saying young black men were targeted 
unfairly during police searches 
many of those who spoke in favor of creating the commission said 
the media must take much of the blame for the way the stuart case 
was presented to the public 
the media today is a business the media is a big business 
the media is a profitable business said house ways and means 
chairman richard voke whose law partner is representing members of 
the stuart family if people get riled up its good for 
business 
one member of the committee rep michael flaherty of boston 
spoke against the proposal saying it could hurt the criminal 
investigation the creation of such a commission would be 
improper imprudent and unprecedented he said 
frank mcgee attorney for the boston police patrolmens 
association said there was no need for a special commission to do 
what 15 agencies already have the authority to do he said the 
polices actions in the case were appropriate 
the police response was excellent he said if anything 
they should have been even more aggressive 
but several groups including the national organization for 
women and the antidefamation league said a commission was needed 
the interest in this case on the part of city officials 
state leaders and the media reflects nothing short of insidious 
institutional racism ellen convisser president of boston now 
said in prepared remarks

breaking with an 80year tradition and a warning 
in the first boy scout manual that girls can lower a mans innate 
character the british boys group has opened its doors to the 
other sex 
the decision announced thursday by chief scout garth morrison 
prompted criticism from the girl guides the boy scouts sister 
movement 
a scout spokesman said thursday there were 680000 british 
scouts and there had been a lot of pressure from girls eager to 
join attracted by the more adventurous activities 
morrison announced local scout groups would be able to choose 
whether to admit girls noting that some want nothing to do with 
girls no group would be forced to have them he said 
we are aware that in some places there is a pressing need for 
it and we are anxious to meet that need it is an important move 
and a move in the right direction morrison said 
morrison an exroyal navy lieutenant said the scout movement 
would be opened to girls ages 6 to 15 with the first girl scouts 
probably enrolled in 1991 
the boy scouts of america movement has allowed girls ages 6 to 
15 in its explorer division for about 19 years according to 
national spokesman lee sneath 
dr june patersonbrown chief commissioner of the british girl 
guides association said she was very angry when she learned of 
the decision 
i hope we are big enough to say that if the scouts want this 
its their decision if they try to poach our girls then it will 
make things very difficult she said 
the two groups had just finished a twoyear joint study on 
greater cooperation 
the head of the guides who count queen elizabeth ii as their 
most famous exmember added they are out of step youth 
services in general have gone full circle and now generally tend to 
favor singlesex activity again 
lord badenpowell the founder of the boy scouts developed many 
of his ideas about scouting from his experiences in the boer war 
and originally envisaged the group as a surveillance force to keep 
watch on enemy movements 
when badenpowell founded the scouts he allowed girls to join 
although he had difficulty communicating with women and 
preferred the company of boys and men it had always been his 
intention that the scouts would be for boys and girls biographer 
timothy jeal told the times of london it was only an edwardian 
outcry against the coarsening effect that such a thing would have 
on genteel young ladies that forced him to abandon the idea 
the times said eight girls had come in uniform to the first 
national scout rally in 1910 badenpowell reportedly turned to his 
sister agnes and said do something about them will you the 
girl guides were founded two months later 
badenpowell himself always had doubts about the effect of the 
female of the species on the psyche of the developing male in his 
1908 founding manual scouting for boys he wrote a loud 
vulgar girl could lower a mans innate character 
nicola lowes 14 who was turned down in october when she and 
two friends applied to join the scout group in wark northern 
england said she would reapply monday 
i was in the guides for a little while but i thought it was 
really boring she said scouts seem more active and you get 
outdoors more i was really upset when i was turned down it 
just wasnt fair

a washington consultant who has been fighting 
the bureaucracy of the port authority of new york and new jersey 
for months has walked into its offices here and seized repayment in 
office equipment according to a published report 
us marshals accompanied frank m graves as he carried a fax 
machine a computer and other equipment from the office of the 14 
billion agency thursday morning to repay the 90980 debt 
according to a story in todays editions of the washington post 
graves had been fighting the port authority for months in small 
claims court saying the agency owed him the money for filling in 
as a speaker at a 2500ahead seminar run by the authority the 
agency said it had made no such agreement with graves 
graves won judgment when the agency failed to turn up for a 
hearing he was therefore allowed to collect 152415 adding 
court costs to the original amount under dispute according to the 
post when the money wasnt paid him graves obtained a writ of 
seizure and took the two us marshals to the office to collect the 
full amount in cash and assets the post said 
the whole case is based upon a giant mistake made by the 
court hugh welsh an assistant general counsel in new york told 
the post as a public agency the port authority has sovereign 
immunity from lawsuits he said 
i guess the answer is youve got to come to court to say 
that responded superior court commissioner thomas j gaye who 
issued the ruling for graves in november 
dc law allows the authority to reopen the case which it began 
efforts to do thursday afternoon by hiring a local law firm to seek 
the return of its equipment and dismissal of the case

the lithuanian parliament has declared its 1940 
annexation by the soviet union was unlawful and invalid and 
tass today acknowledged the move as a step toward secession 
the lithuanians whose communist party broke with the kremlin in 
december took the new action wednesday they said they want to 
start talks with moscow on lithuanian independence 
estonia took a similar action in november declaring the 
annexation of the baltic republics invalid 
the legislatures of all three baltic republics including 
latvia already had condemned the sovietgerman agreement of 1939 
that gave free rein to hitler in poland and to stalin in the 
baltics 
lithuanians supreme soviet or parliament on wednesday passed 
a resolution declaring that legislation passed on july 21 1940 
making lithuania a soviet republic did not express the will of the 
people and was unlawful and invalid 
the lithuanian action coincided with the final day of a meeting 
of the national communist party central committee where party 
leaders denounced the lithuanian party for breaking ties with 
moscow they said the split undermines the unity of the party and 
damages president mikhail s gorbachevs reform program 
however the central committee also said it was ready to drop 
its own constitutional guarantee of power and accept a multiparty 
system 
in its report tass the official news agency said wednesdays 
resolution in lithuania cannot be regarded otherwise than a step 
toward this baltic republics secession from the soviet union 
will lithuania and the soviet union proceed along the road 
together or take separate paths the news agency asked time 
will judge who is right in this contention 
the lithuanian resolution also called for abolishing all 
constitutional ties of lithuanians to the soviet union and 
returning some nationalized industries to private ownership

cows can graze on land littered with errant 
ordnance from neighboring naval bombing ranges but people are too 
curious to be allowed to hike or drive offroad vehicles there a 
navy commander said 
we dont feel cattle are inquisitive enough to go over and 
start banging on a bomb with a hammer capt rex rackowitz 
commander of fallon naval air station said thursday 
we should not ever allow the public to go on there for any 
recreational purposes rackowitz told the state multiple use 
advisory committee on federal lands 
rackowitz appeared to explain the navys operation ugly baby 
last year to clear out or blow up bombs and other ordnance dropped 
outside his bases ranges for 30 years because of pilot or 
equipment error 
about 110000 acres of federal bureau of land management 
property adjacent to three fallon base ranges starting about 60 
miles east of reno have been closed temporarily for winter while 
the cleanup progresses 
the bureau opposes letting the navy acquire the land however 
bureau spokesman bob stewart said any permanent closure of the land 
around the naval bases ranges would require congressional action 
its either totally open or totally closed stewart told the 
state panel 
environmentalists and state officials also oppose the navys 
request 
during the cleanup efforts that were initially secret but made 
public in news reports the navy said it recovered 1270 live 
pieces of ordnance on the three ranges including 80 bombs and 
1996 inert pieces of ordnance including 52 bombs one rocket and 
88 small training bombs 
the navy believes it retrieved about 92 percent of the surface 
bombs dropped on the public lands where cattle have grazed and 
people have hiked and ridden offroad vehicles since the base 
opened in 1942 
but the military cant get at belowsurface explosives and duds 
that landed outside its bombing areas because of pilot or equipment 
error or which bounced on the desert surface and over fences 
surrounding the ranges rackowitz said 
we have to assume theres a significant quantity of ordnance 
lying below the surface which we have no capability of finding

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev today pledged 
to press on with yet more reforms once he has implemented the 
sweeping limits on communist party power he pushed through the 
leadership just days ago 
an economic adviser warned the party faces the stark choice of 
reforming itself or losing power to the opponents it has agreed to 
legalize and leading populist boris n yeltsin said progressive 
communists may break away to form their own party 
the comments by economist nikolai petrakov were the first since 
the partys central committee agreed to end communists monopoly on 
power in which a top official raised the possibility that it 
actually could lose its ruling position 
gorbachev meeting with us secretary of state james a baker 
iii said he had achieved everything he had set out to do at a 
threeday meeting of the communist party central committee that 
ended wednesday 
once we have solidified this phase we will move on he said 
gorbachev gave a guarded answer when asked if he would run for 
president if the country implements a new stronger office chosen 
by a contested election 
lets wait and see he told reporters at the start of his 
meeting with baker 
looking relaxed as he spoke with a halfdozen reporters he 
added that the changes pushed through the central committee this 
week had been in the works ever since he took power in 1985 
it certainly would be wrong for the west and everyone to 
believe we began these changes only in the last few days he 
said they have been under way since 1985 
on wednesday the central committee gave gorbachev nearly 
unanimous approval of his proposal to strike an article of the 
soviet constitution that guarantees the party the role of the 
countrys leading and guiding force gorbachev said that now on 
the party will have to prove its right to rule 
the central committee also gave gorbachev approval to move up 
the next party congress which has the power to choose a new party 
leadership 
petrakov told tass that after the party gives up its guarantee 
of power the party may face the possibility of losing power or 
perhaps even disappearing altogether 
a choice stands before the party in the conditions of 
political pluralism restructure itself and struggle to show in 
competition its right to be the ruling party or slide into 
opposition maybe even to leave the political arena petrakov 
said 
reformers contend that the partys decision to release its legal 
grip on power doesnt address the countrys main problems economic 
chaos and continued pervasive party control of society 
yeltsin an unorthodox communist who has emerged as the leading 
advocate of farreaching change on thursday called the partys new 
program only a halfstep forward 
you talk about approving this program how can i do it he 
asked 
a second party should be formed unless the congress removes 
conservatives from the party hierarchy said yeltsin who cast the 
only vote against the changes wednesday in the policymarking 
central committee 
reformers said the party must end its sevendecade strangehold 
on the nations institutions to fulfill its promise for a 
multiparty political system 
it is necessary to eliminate party organizations in the army 
the police the kgb the courts in all the state institutions 
saidyuri mityunov a spokesman for the independent democratic union 
the movement for reform is building popular strength with a 
growing number of angry crowds across the soviet union demanding 
the ouster of hardline communist leaders mityunov said 
party secretaries in volgograd tyumen chernigov and sverdlovsk 
were removed in recent weeks the tv program vremya showed a 
rally in donetsk on thursday where people demanded the resignation 
of politburo member yegor k ligachev a leading conservative 
in london party ideology chief vadim a medvedev said the 
country had avoided a cataclysmic explosion in putting into 
effect gorbachevs program of reforms known as perestroika we 
have channeled this process into an area of controlled reaction 
he told a news conference 
yeltsin who also belongs to the soviet parliament called the 
platform a halfstep forward that lessens the tension before 
the party congress late in june 
the party congress will vote on the party platform and has the 
power to change the central committee 
yeltsin said the party platform which has yet to be made 
available in its details to the public contained outdated language 
and failed to endorse radical measures needed to undo the economic 
chaos created by central planning 
he said the draft still endorses democratic centralism the 
principle used to justify central planning

government troops have overrun a 
stronghold of ethnic minority rebels along the thai border after 10 
days of fighting that killed at least 36 people a military 
spokesman said today 
the seizure of the town represented another in a string of 
victories in recent months that has crippled burmas ethnic karen 
insurgents 
thai authorities confirming the capture of three pagoda pass 
said 3000 to 5000 civilians had fled into thailand to escape the 
fighting 
the capture came as rebels of the new mon state party and the 
karen national union were preparing to celebrate their national 
days foreign correspondents in bangkok thailand had been invited 
to the festivities and a news conference at three pagoda pass this 
weekend 
col than tun a military spokesman told reporters that 16 
government soldiers were killed and 42 wounded in five major 
clashes leading to the capture of the frontier town thursday he 
said 20 rebel bodies were counted 
than tun said mopping up operations were continuing in the area 
located 170 miles southeast of rangoon and 175 miles northwest of 
bangkok 
the mon and karen rebels are among several ethnic groups 
fighting for greater autonomy from the government dominated by the 
burman majority 
col lertchai pinthong of thailands border police said fighting 
was continuing today at a mon military camp two miles from three 
pagoda pass he said thais living in a village opposite the town 
had fled their homes and some wounded were being treated at 
hospitals inside thailand 
the border police also reported escalated fighting at kaw moo 
ra further north along the thaiburmese frontier 
burmese troops have been trying to seize that karen base and had 
stepped up artillery and mortar barrages in recent days the police 
said 
government forces have overrun a string of karen military bases 
along the border although the karen national unions headquarters 
at manerplaw has not been attacked 
the ramshackle town of three pagodas pass includes a thriving 
marketplace warehouses brimming with smuggled goods and the mon 
headquarters some karen also have been living there 
the ethnic insurgents have come to rely on smuggling between 
thailand and burma to fuel their rebellions while the burmese 
government has stepped up efforts to control the jungle frontier 
the mon claim to field more than 3000 fighters while the karen 
have a considerably larger force 
the two have joined 20 other insurgent groups in the democratic 
alliance of burma which has vowed to topple the martial law 
government of gen saw maung 
saw maung and a group of military officers put down a 
nationwide prodemocracy uprising nearly two years ago killing 
hundreds of people the resistance forces now include students who 
fled the interior in wake of the crackdown and sought refuge with 
the rebel groups

high school wrestlers focusing on pins reversals 
and takedowns had better worry about herpes gladiatorum too 
federal health researchers say 
an outbreak of the viral skin disease swept through a high 
school wrestling camp in minnesota last summer leaving 60 out of 
175 young men battling symptoms including blistery skin rash 
fever sore throat and swollen lymph nodes the national centers 
for disease control reported thursday 
the disease is spread the cdc said through skintoskin 
contact obviously a problem for wrestlers 
the atlantabased cdc said wrestlers should have skin 
examinations before practice or matches and wrestlers with 
suspicious skin lesions should sit out 
the virus is herpes simplex type 1 the same one that causes 
cold sores a different virus herpes simplex type 2 causes 
genital herpes 
and although the skin rash and other symptoms go away the 
infection like all herpes infections can reappear months or years 
later 
in 1985 a survey of athletic trainers found that about 3 
percent of the nations high school wrestlers had herpes skin 
infections during the previous wrestling season 
herpes gladiatorum was reported in 1964 in a study in the new 
england journal of medicine it also is know to afflict players of 
rugby another contact sport 
we really dont know to what extent it is a problem but it 
seems to be recognized by the wrestling community as something to 
watch out for said dr edward belongia a cdc medical 
epidemiologist at the minnesota department of health 
some of the 60 young wrestlers who became ill at the robinson 
wrestling camp at the university of minnesota last summer already 
have had a recurrence belongia said its not known if they have 
spread the ailment to any other wrestlers in this years 
competition 
the outbreak was discovered during the final week of the 26day 
minnesota camp and contact was discontinued for the final two 
days herpes conjunctivitis inflammation of the eye covering 
occurred in five patients although none developed keratitis a 
more serious inflammation of the cornea

the governing party and two opposition 
groups formally merged today into a powerful new conservative 
coalition and hundreds of radical students battled police in two 
cities to protest the alliance 
the leader of the only remaining opposition party denounced the 
merger as a kind of coup detat that betrayed the people no

april kim youngsam would be made the chief executive of the new 
party he said kim 62 is regarded as a likely successor to roh 
whose term expires in 1993

change next year to replace the nations current presidential 
system of government with a parliamentary system headed by a 
premier 
kim daejung said his partys champions several issues spurned 
by the new coalition the right to form independent labor unions 
a more equitable distribution of wealth abolishment of the

rival christian forces ignored a truce 
and traded heavy sniper fire in east beirut today as hundreds of 
civilians scrambled to safety outside the christian sector 
snipers killed three people as they tried to escape the 
lowincome residential district of ein rummaneh police said 
rescuers evacuated the bulletriddled corpses of 42 victims from 
east beirut districts where most of the savage fighting took place 
between soldiers of gen michel aoun and samir geageas lebanese 
forces militiamen 
those victims raised the toll by police count to 418 killed 
and 1680 wounded in the worst intrachristian conflict of the 
15yearold civil war the fighting began jan 30 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
regulations said the exchange of sniper fire threatened the pact 
announced late thursday to end the showdown for control of the 
310squaremile christian enclave encompassing east beirut and 
coastal communities to the north 
aouns soldiers are besieging the residential district of 
ashrafiyeh a stronghold for geageas militia from the northeast 
and southeast 
the clashes have divided east beirut and other christian 
districts into hostile territories forcing hundreds of civilians 
to flee into the citys moslem sector and other areas outside the 
enclave 
local radio stations have been broadcasting messages from people 
asking about missing relatives 
mrs nadima mazboudi worried about her daughter therese and 
crippled granddaughter reine said over the voice of the people 
radio where is reine what happened to her 
snipers bullets whizzed overhead today as civilians carrying 
bags of clothes and other belongings rushed into moslem west 
beirut 
in one lebanese forces stronghold in the city ein rummaneh 
geageas militiamen took cover on street corners 
aoun will pay dearly if he tries to storm ein rummaneh said 
a bearded lebanese forces militiaman 
thousands of his soldiers would be killed he said and then 
shouted to civilians to avoid mines planted in a nearby street 
snipers from aouns army fired at targets in the ein rummaneh 
district and geageas militias responded with salvoes from their 
sovietmade ak47 assault rifles 
come and take our guns if you can a militiaman shouted as 
he fired a 30bullet clip from his automatic rifle in the direction 
of aouns lines 
geagea held a news conference and called aoun mad a liar an 
utter fool in politics 
you shouldnt think you can finish us off we shall fight you 
100 years he said 
the peace pact included a ceasefire agreement and affirmation 
that there is no intention or decision to liquidate the lebanese 
forces 
however it said a national authority under aoun should be 
formed to tackle essential issues 
aoun has accused geagea of trying to enforce an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end the nations civil war the 
october accord worked out by lebanese legislators in saudi arabia 
led to the formation of a government under president elias hrawi 
also a christian 
however aoun attacked that pact because it set no date for 
withdrawal of the 40000 syrian troops in lebanon who control most 
of the country aoun who was appointed last year to head an 
interim cabinet refused to acknowledge hrawis government 
the syrian soldiers were deployed in lebanon in 1976 under an 
arab league mandate to quell the civil war fighting 
however aoun says they violated their peacekeeping mandate by 
siding with the moslems

a man with at least seven 
previous theft and fraud convictions was sentenced today to 12 
years in prison for the shotgun murder of frank budd father of 
distance runner zola budd 
christiaan barnard 24 who could have been sentenced to hang 
was described by supreme court justice ap von coller as a 
dishonest witness but the judge said there was a reasonable 
possibility that barnard had been provoked into the killing because 
budd made sexual advances toward him 
barnard also was convicted of stealing a pickup truck from 
budds farm 
budd 59 at the time of his death in september was a 
homosexual according to associates and family members 
zola budd said after his death that his homosexuality was a 
factor in her parents separation in 1984 and subsequent divorce 
she had very little contact with him after the divorce and did not 
invite him to her wedding last year 
because of her fathers british ancestry ms budd was able to 
obtain a british passport and compete in the 1984 summer olympics 
in los angeles south africans are barred from the olympics and 
most international competition because of the governments racial 
segregation policies 
in the 3000meter run in los angeles ms budd collided with 
us star mary decker and the american was unable to finish budd 
finished seventh to a chorus of boos 
she later set several world distance records while living and 
training in britain but returned to south africa in may 1988 
complaining of mental exhaustion because of harassment from 
antiapartheid activists 
she has resumed competition in south africa although her times 
are still far slower than her career bests

the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
order calling for the death of author salman rushdie must be 
carried out irans spiritual leader said today 
in london british prime minister margaret thatcher condemned 
todays sermon by ayatollah ali khamenei and said it was much to 
be regretted in a related development nine iranians deported 
from britain arrived in tehran 
khamenei khomeinis successor said khomeinis fatwa or 
religious decree about the writer of the blasphemous book the 
satanic verses is still valid and must be implemented according 
to a tehran radio broadcast monitored in nicosia 
rushdie an indianborn british author has been in hiding in 
britain since khomeini issued the decree feb 14 1989 moslem 
fundamentalists consider his 1988 book blasphemous for its 
irreverent treatment of the prophet mohammed islams founder 
rushdie said this week he considered appearing in public to 
deliver a lecture on censorship but had been dissuaded by his 
police guards he also said he regretted the pain the book had 
caused but said he stood by his work 
he said he was pressing for a paperback edition viking penguin 
rushdies publishers has said no decision has been made about a 
paperback edition 
blake morrison literary editor of the independent on sunday and 
a friend of rushdie called khameneis statements disappointing 
news in a week when he rushdie has made a real effort to reopen 
the debate in a more peaceful way 
obviously it was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory 
tone adopted here would filter through to tehran morrison told 
bbc radio 
the international controversy over the book increased last year 
when khomeini issued the death decree and several iranian leaders 
put a 52 million bounty on rushdies head 
britain along with about 12 western allies recalled their 
ambassadors from tehran to protest the fatwa the european allies 
resumed ties with iran but tehran severed relations with london 
accusing it of trying to pressure khomeini to revoke the death 
decree 
in tehran today an iranian tv journalist deported along with an 
iran air official and seven students said it was no coincidence 
that their expulsions came near the anniversary of khomeinis death 
decree 
the london bureau chief of the islamic republic of iran 
broadcasting identified only as keivanara told tehran radio the 
expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the 
anniversary of the death order against salman rushdie 
britain announced feb 1 that the nine had to be out within a 
week for reasons of national security it did not elaborate but 
similar expulsions in the past have been linked to the rushdie 
death decree

an american diplomat met with highranking 
officials of the plo and the arab league to discuss the emigration 
of soviet jews to israel sources in the tunisian capital reported 
today 
in damascus syria the soviet ambassador suggested that arab 
nations take active steps against the united states to prevent 
soviet jews from settling in the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip the official syrian arab news agency reported today 
soviet ambassador alexander zotov did not specify what steps 
should be taken and did not refer to the united states by name in 
the statement he made to the agency thursday 
but he said arabs should take effective and active steps 
against those western nations who provide israel with large 
economic financial and military aid which constitutes the 
essential base for israel to continue its expansionist and 
aggressive policy and ignore the demands of the international 
community 
the united states gives israel 3 billion in aid annually its 
largest single beneficiary the aid cannot be earmarked for use in 
the occupied territories but it amounts to a massive subsidy for 
the israeli budget 
zotov said the soviet union understands the distress of arab 
governments over israels plan over the next three years to settle 
300000 soviet jews in the territories it seized in the 1967 
mideast war but he said moscow cannot block soviet citizens from 
settling where they wish 
the palestine liberation organization wants to establish an 
independent state in the territories and fears largescale 
settlement of soviet jews will make a negotiated settlement 
impossible the populations of the west bank and gaza strip are 
overwhelmingly palestinian 
the palestinian uprising in the territories now more than two 
years old has left more than 800 palestinians and 40 israelis dead 
in tunis us ambassador robert pelletreau met with plo 
official hakim balawi and with arab league president chedli klibi 
sources said as both organizations stepped up the campaign to 
choke the emigration 
the palestinian news agency wafa said the talks thursday between 
pelletreau and balawi covered the gravity and the repercussions 
of the migration of soviet jews and their implantation in the 
occupied palestinian territories 
wafa did not say whether pelletreau and balawi reached an 
agreement the us embassy the sole american body authorized to 
talk with the plo never comments on such meetings 
sources close to the arab league said klibi and pelletreau 
discussed the leagues plan to send a delegation to moscow 
washington and the european community to press for cuts in soviet 
jewish emigration 
a senior aide of plo leader yasser arafat was quoted today as 
warning that the influx of soviet jews into israel might encourage 
israel to invade jordan as part of its endeavor to create greater 
israel 
arafat spokesman bassam abu sharif also warned that israel would 
force palestinians out of the occupied territories to make way for 
the influx 
the soviet jewish immigration will form a new army that helps 
israel to realize the expansionist dreams of the israeli prime 
minister he told the kuwaiti daily alanbaa from plo 
headquarters in tunis

twentytwo senior antiapartheid 
leaders met with nelson mandela today for a political strategy 
session johannesburg police clubbed peaceful demonstrators marking 
their first week of new freedoms 
also today president fw de klerk warned that conservative 
whites who have criticized the concessions he announced last week 
could ignite a racial war in south africa 
police beat and chased hundreds of blacks through the streets of 
downtown johannesburg after the blacks spilled out of st marys 
anglican church dancing and singing freedom songs 
about 1000 people had been marking last weeks legalization of 
the african national congress guerrilla movement 
a policeman ordered the crowd to disperse but within seconds 
his fellow officers converged on the activists from both sides and 
began hitting them with clubs 
police chased fleeing demonstrators through busy downtown 
streets toppling the stalls of vendors and forcing cars to come to 
screeching halts 
in several instances police surrounded unarmed demonstrators 
and hit them five or more times with their batons police arrested 
several people and several more were hurt 
some activists threw bottles and rocks at the police after they 
began hitting the demonstrators 
de klerk has said his government will permit peaceful protest if 
permission is sought from authorities in advance on several recent 
occasions police have forcibly dispersed peaceful crowds calling 
the demonstrations illegal 
on feb 2 in a speech that opened a new era in south african 
politics de klerk also lifted restrictions on internal opposition 
groups ended a 30year ban on mandelas african national congress 
and pledged to free mandela soon 
at victor verster prison farm the largest delegation yet to see 
mandela at his home included most members of the executive 
committee of the united democratic front a nationwide 
antiapartheid coalition 
his feeling was at the end of the meeting how he wished 
he could come home with us said murphy morobe one of the 
fronts chief spokesmen mandela and his visitors ended the session 
by singing god bless africa the anthem of the antiapartheid 
movement 
the delegates presented mandela with a policy document saying 
negotiations with the government could start only after democratic 
nonracial elections to form an assembly that would draft a new 
constitution de klerk has rejected this demand 
morobe said on his way into the prison farm that he was very 
hopeful this could be the last meeting in prison between mandela 
and south african activists 
the rev jesse jackson tentatively plans to meet mandela on 
monday as part of his 12day visit to south africa the government 
has not confirmed that this meeting will take place nor has it 
confirmed reports that the american civil rights leader will meet 
de klerk on monday 
mandela 71 is the most popular leader among south africas 
disenfranchised black majority and has offered to serve as mediator 
in talks between the government and the anc he has been jailed 
since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for helping plan the 
start of the ancs guerrilla campaign 
the leader of the proapartheid conservative party andries 
treurnicht introduced a noconfidence motion friday in parliament 
and denounced de klerks moves to open talks with the anc 
treurnicht contended that the security forces had been 
instructed to view rightwing whites rather than the anc as the 
governments principal enemy 
who is being monitored now not the terrorists not the 
infiltrators but our people treurnicht said 
the conservative party has threatened to employ militant tactics 
to force de klerk to call an election so whites can express their 
views on his moves 
in parliament de klerk for the first time responded publicly to 
the rightwing criticism and warned that the conservatives will 
plunge this country into racial war 
de klerk defended himself and his national party in a 
noconfidence debate 
the national party talks of renewal and courage and they talk 
of racism and aggression he said 
de klerk said his own party will still be here 10 to 20 years 
from now looking after the interests of its people and cooperating 
with the leaders of other people 
de klerk said his national party had recognized that a ban on 
the anc and the south african communist party had the effect of 
drawing attention away from their faults at the same time it was 
a stumbling block in the path of the politics of negotiation 
meanwhile the antiapartheid national sports council said a 
tour by an english cricket team was provoking violence and urged 
british prime minister margaret thatcher to order the players home

excommunist members of parliament 
threatened to walk out of the chamber today after a solidarity 
deputy suggested they had no moral right to vote on the design of 
polands new official emblem 
the emblem a crowned white eagle on a red background will 
replace the uncrowned white eagle that decorated government offices 
and official documents during the 45 years of communist rule after 
world war ii 
parliament in december voted to restore the prewar crown 
symbolizing polands sovereignty the vote today in the sejm 
parliaments lower house was on the specific pattern of the emblem 
despite heated appeals by religiousoriented deputies 
parliament rejected a design change that would have included a 
small cross on the crown 
solidarity deputy jan lopuszanski then rose to address the 173 
parliament members elected to seats guaranteed last year to the 
nowdissolved communist party 
i have a moral appeal to the left side of the hall i think 
that this voting should take place without you i think you would 
be right to abstain from voting on this issue he said 
the appeal was met by murmurings in the hall with about a dozen 
of the excommunist deputies rising as if to leave 
sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz immediately called a short 
recess to avert a walkout 
in recent months there has been an increasing questioning of 
the legitimacy of the excommunist deputies who now have become 
independent or joined one of two new socialdemocratic parties 
they were elected to seats set aside for communist party members 
under last years talks 
the agreement reached in april by the communists and the 
thenopposition set up what were at the time the most democratic 
elections in east bloc history 
poles voted june 2 on candidates for a new completely freely 
elected senate and 161 sejm seats the communist candidates won 
none of the freely contested seats

a federal judge has cleared the way for a trial 
by former nevada test site workers who claim in a decadeold suit 
that they contracted cancer and other diseases from nuclear weapons 
testing 
us district judge roger foley on thursday rejected a 
government appeal of his earlier ruling stripping government 
immunity from the lawsuits and ordered both sides to determine by 
midmay which of the 400 cases should go to trial 
in denying the appeal foley had harsh words for a government he 
said once felt it had the right to sacrifice its citizens at the 
nuclear altar 
thank god the government has found its conscience foley 
said in a ruling that was greeted with applause by family and 
friends of the former workers who crowded into the courtroom 
foley said thursday that evolving legal precedent and a 
heightened awareness among federal lawmakers have made such claims 
a whole new ball game and said a trial should be held as soon 
as possible 
i dont see any basis for trotting this issue back to the 
court of appeals the judge said 
attorneys for the plaintiffs who first filed suit in 1980 said 
the ruling may bring the case to trial by early next year 
this is a big day for us said stewart udall 
udall and fellow attorney larry johns said they plan to select 
six litigants as a representative sample for the trial including 
former test site employee keith prescott who first sued for 101 
million in may 1980 
prescott now 64 worked at the nuclear proving ground from 1961 
to 1968 and later developed multiple myeloma a disease that 
destroys bone marrow 
the original litigation included 220 former test site workers 
all but 18 of whom are now dead but was later expanded to about 
400 plaintiffs who are seeking more than 1 billion in damages 
foley in his ruling had harsh words for the governments 
management of the nuclear testing program 
at the highest level of government it was believed and decided 
that national security required for human safety to be subjugated 
to the greater national need of the nuclear weapons test he said 
foley said minutes of an atomic energy commission meeting 
unearthed in another test site suit revealed the governments did 
not want to warn its citizens of the perils of nuclear testing 
because theyll raise a protest they must be sacrificed 
although foley suggested that some surviving workers be included 
in the group johns said that may not be possible 
not too many are still alive he said cancer is a fatal 
disease thats the reality

secretary of state james a baker iii 
will make an unscheduled stop in romania this weekend after his 
trip to moscow the government announced today 
baker would be the highestranking us official to visit 
romania since the december revolution that toppled communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
it would follow strong us criticism of the provisional 
governments attempts to impede opposition parties taking part in 
the may 20 general election 
dan radulescu spokesman for the governing national salvation 
front said baker would spend a few hours in bucharest 
probably sunday morning 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutweiler recently 
indicated that baker would not stop in romania because his presence 
might give the wrong signals about us support in the campaign 
baker met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in moscow 
today for a third day of arms control discussions 
bakers visit to romania was announced as the new council of 
national unity which gives 29 opposition parties a voice in 
running romania until the may election was holding its inaugural 
meeting 
the 180member council replaces the sevenmember ruling council 
of the national salvation front which came to power at the height 
of the revolution 
the front which has transformed itself into a political 
movement to contest the election is considered the frontrunner 
because of its role in overthrowing ceausescu 
the national peasant party the largest opposition party said 
it fears the front will try to control the new council and give 
seats to highranking communists 
the front expanded the ruling council to include more opposition 
members after widespread criticism of an antiopposition 
demonstration that appeared to have been orchestrated by the 
provisional government the united states was among the nations 
issuing criticism 
the united states has been criticized in romania for not giving 
enough help to the country following the revolution the only one 
of the six revolts against hardline communism in eastern europe 
that became a bloodbath 
ion radulescu who was appointed by the front to coordinate 
foreign relief said the biggest donors have been france belgium 
holland west germany italy soviet moldavia which has a large 
ethnic romanian population and other east bloc countries 
from the united states we are still waiting he said 
the united states gave 500000 worth of aid to the 
international committee of the red cross for romania and donated

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
secretary of state james a baker iii met for nearly four hours 
today and gorbachev said president bushs proposal for reducing 
troops in europe deserves very serious consideration 
baker and senior aides were in their third day of talks with 
gorbachev and other kremlin leaders on arms control and other 
issues in advance of an expected superpower summit next summer 
gorbachev and baker accompanied by close aides met for one 
hour and 45 minutes and then the two met for another two hours 
without aides 
baker saw soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze before 
and after his meetings with gorbachev us officials said their 
focus was on arms control which experts from the two sides tried 
to advance during the day at their own meetings 
shevardnadze said the discussion of the disarmament problem is 
proceeding very well 
at the start of todays meeting with baker gorbachev praised 
bushs troopreduction proposal for cutting the number of us and 
soviet troops in europe it merits very very serious 
consideration he said 
the soviet leader has called in the past for even broader 
disarmament measures asked if bush should have gone further than 
to propose leaving 225000 american and soviet troops in europe 
gorbachev said 
i dont know its up to the us government to make its own 
proposal it would be good if we cooperate just as we are 
cooperating now 
the soviet leader appeared relaxed as he shook hands with baker 
and a half dozen us officials 
baker ends his visit here saturday and will fly to bucharest 
romania where that government says he will spend a few hours 
probably sunday morning the state department earlier had indicated 
baker would not stop in romania because of us criticism of the 
provisional governments attempts to impede opposition parties 
taking part in the may 20 elections 
before todays sessions with gorbachev baker met with 
shevardnadze who told reporters i think we may speak of 
progress at the talks 
deputy foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh told tass the 
soviet news agency said the talks had a particularly 
businesslike and constructive character 
baker was eager to hear gorbachevs assessment of bushs 
proposal to cut troops 
so far the reaction from shevardnadze and other soviet 
officials on a proposal by president bush to limit both sides 
troops tanks and nonnuclear airplanes in europe has been 
positive but gorbachev whose own disarmament goals are more 
ambitious had the opportunity in todays meeting to push for even 
deeper cutbacks than bushs proposal to limit both sides to 225000 
bushs troop reduction proposal included limiting us and 
soviet troops in central europe to 195000 on each side he 
proposed allowing another 30000 americans elsewhere in europe 
gorbachev spoke on a wide range of other issues before going 
into his meeting with baker today including his own future as head 
of the communist party now that the central committee has decided 
to revoke the partys monopoly on power 
asked how the action would affect him gorbachev said i would 
not think anything particular happened to me what we wanted to 
achieve at this plenum we did achieve he said 
he said the changes began when he came to power five years ago 
and once we have solidified this phase we will move further 
over two days of meetings baker and shevardnadze made some 
headway toward a treaty as well as on another accord due for 
signing at the washington summit meeting in june to reduce 
longrange nuclear missiles bombers and submarines by 30 percent 
to 50 percent 
on another front the two sides are finding themselves in 
agreement in opposing israels resettlement of jewish immigrants 
from the soviet union on the west bank 
it is quite possible that as a result of the sovietamerican 
talks a common viewpoint will be expressed on this issue 
condemning israels attempt to resettle immigrants on someone 
elses occupied territory gennady i gerasimov the soviet 
foreign ministry spokesman said thursday night there are no 
differences between the united states and us on this issue 
shevardnadze and bessmertnykh echoed the positive us appraisal 
of the arms control talks the discussion of the disarmament 
problem is proceeding very well shevardnadze told tass 
baker offered at least one concession that would permit the 
soviets to exclude from a projected ceiling some of the combat 
aircraft they contend are defensive 
the soviets meanwhile dropped their demand for a provision 
that would allow them to scrap a treaty to reduce longrange 
nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent if moscow concluded 
us antimissile defenses in space were illegal 
but the us official who reported the concession acknowledged 
the treaty would include a common escape clause either side could 
abandon the restrictions if it concluded the treaty did not serve 
its national interest 
the separate briefings produced evidence of discord too 
gerasimov said the united states still refuses to consider 
reducing naval forces and he said the soviets would not sign the 
treaty if a dispute over sealaunched cruise missiles was not 
resolved 
here too the bush administration refuses to accept limits on 
the weapons carried aboard nuclear submarines and surface ships 
the net result of the talks so far is that the superpowers 
steadily more cooperative relationship apparently will not be 
inhibited by the decisions at the central committee meeting 
in fact shevardnadze said it will mean that we have more 
elements of trust in our relationship we simply cannot afford 
lowering our international activity

tu electric today began loading nuclear fuel at 
comanche peak the final tedious step in the construction of the 
twinreactor plant that took 15 years and 9 billion to complete 
the utility received a lowpower testing license thursday from 
the nuclear regulatory commission which said it was satisfied with 
the plants safety 
the license authorizes tu electric to test unit 1 of the plant 
at up to 5 percent of full power 
during that phase they will check things out they will do a 
lot of testing checking things out they cannot go to full power 
without the commissions approval nrc spokesman bob newlin said 
assuming these early operations are successfully conducted in 
about three months we will be able to gradually increase output and 
be in full commercial operation this summer said david fiorelli 
a spokesman for the utility 
newlin however said he could not predict when the utility 
would win a fullpower license 
the license action upset members of citizens for fair utility 
regulation a fort worthbased activist group that asked the nrc 
wednesday to indefinitely postpone licensing the plant 
the group which is also battling the plant in court argues 
that tu electric managers have not learned how to recognize and 
resolve serious safety problems at comanche peak betty brink a 
group member said she does not think the plant will ever operate 
at full power but if it does i fear the very worst 
but the nrc in a news release said the safety questions have 
been resolved satisfactorily 
construction on comanche peak began in 1975 and original 
estimates put the total cost at 779 million the facilitys price 
is now 91 billion tu electric serves 5 million customers in 85 
counties in texas including the dallasfort worth area

after denying for 40 years that it had 
anything to do with the nazis extermination of 6 million jews 
east germany now admits responsibility for war crimes committed by 
the german people 
the decision adopted by the east german cabinet was conveyed in 
a letter by prime minister hans modrow to the world jewish 
congress the east german government also has decided to compensate 
survivors of the nazi atrocities according to the statement 
released thursday in the united states and in east berlin 
the shift in east germanys position brings it a step closer to 
west germany which in 1951 accepted full blame for the war crimes 
of the third reich west germany has since paid 43 billion in 
reparations to israel to jewish organizations and to survivors and 
their families 
but east germany until now rejected any share of the blame and 
refused to compensate victims of the nazis arguing that the 
country had only come into existence in 1949 and did not bear 
responsibility for the deeds of adolf hitlers third reich 
the communists who founded east germany had themselves been 
persecuted by the nazis and viewed themselves as victims rather 
than perpetrators 
the german democratic republic recognizes the responsibility 
of the entire german people for the past said the government 
statement conveyed by modrow in the letter to wjc president edgar 
bronfman 
this is a consequence of the deep guilt of hitler fascism 
which committed terrible crimes against the jewish people in the 
name of the german people according to the statement 
the gdr recognizes its humanitarian duty with regard to the 
survivors of the jewish people who suffered under nazi oppression 
and confirms its readiness to provide material support to former 
persecutees of the nazi regime of jewish origin the letter said 
there are only about 4000 jews in east germany and some 37000 
in the west down from a prewar high of 530000 community 
leaders have estimated that billions of dollars worth of jewish 
property was seized by the nazis in what is now east berlin 
the gdr stands unaltered in its commitment to do everything 
against racism nazism antisemitism and hatred among peoples 
the statement said 
east germany is eager to establish ties with israel and with the 
jewish community in the united states apparently as a means of 
attracting investments and us support for its declining economy 
modrow urged bronfman to visit east germany soon in order to 
further our common aims 
a wjc official said bronfman probably would visit modrow after 
east germanys first democratic elections scheduled for march 18 
the acceptance of the gdr of its historic moral responsibility 
is an important first step toward speedy reparations for the 
victims of the nazis the wjc said bronfman leaves for israel next 
week to discuss the development with prime minister yitzhak shamir 
in jerusalem israeli officials today praised east germanys 
decision but said they want practical steps before forging ties 
with that country 
we have to chew a little bit on the wording of modrows 
declaration but obviously it is a beginning i dont think we have 
ever heard before this kind of a declaration from east germany 
said michael shilo an israeli foreign ministry official 
at the initiation of east germany its representatives met last 
week with israeli officials in copenhagen for preliminary talks on 
establishing diplomatic relations 
israel said diplomatic relations would be contingent on east 
germanys acceptance of its share in the moral and historical 
responsibility for the nazis persecution of jews 
most of the eastern european countries moving from communism 
toward democracy have recently established diplomatic ties with 
israel

seditious article festo ebong 29 of the governmentowned new

not consider relinguishing zambias presidency after 25 years in 
power

an elderly woman who was the focus of a court 
battle over her refusal to have lifesaving surgery has agreed to 
have the operation a relative said friday 
ruth trabelsi consented to the operation after a visit from 
mordechai eliahu chief rabbi of israels sephardic jews said a 
man who described himself as one of mrs trabelsis grandsons 
the chief rabbi spoke to her explained the situation to 
her he came out with a positive answer the grandson said in a 
telephone interview from poriah hospital in tiberias 
he said doctors were planning to perform the operation later 
friday to remove the 84yearold womans gangrenous right foot 
the case went to court wednesday after mrs trabelsi refused to 
have the surgery saying she wanted to enter the garden of eden 
on both feet 
doctors said she would probably die without the operation and 
the government went to court under a law that requires it to 
protect people who may not be capable of making decisions for 
themselves 
the case was dropped thursday after a geriatric specialist 
testified that mrs trabelsi was fully capable of making her own 
decisions 
but some of the womans 258 children grandchildren and 
greatgrandchildren along with leading rabbis said they would 
continue pressing mrs trabelsi to have surgery 
the case was widely publicized in israel and the subject of much 
debate over the right to die the broadcaster who announced the 
outcome of the case friday on israel radio introduced it by saying 
now to the leg affair 
rabbi eliahu said he agreed to talk to mrs trabelsi after the 
family stopped arguing over the case 
the family is all united sometimes amputation is also 
healing eliahu said on israel radio 
eliahu said before his trip that he felt mrs trabelsi should 
accept doctors advice to have her leg amputated rabbis who shared 
his view said that if she refused she would be violating religious 
law by in effect comitting suicide 
other rabbis had argued that the surgery should not be forced on 
mrs trabelsi who developed the gangrene in her right leg as a 
complication from hardening of the arteries and blood clotting

gubernatorial candidate ann richards who 
gained national attention for a speech at the 1988 democratic 
national convention has stirred up controversy by seeming to refer 
in a debate to a white woman 
ms richards the state treasurer denies that she used the term 
white woman during wednesdays debate among the three leading 
democratic candidates saying her comment was misheard and she was 
saying why a woman 
rival jim mattox state attorney general said the comment shows 
ms richards represents the white feminist fringe that 
prompted ms richards campaign manager glenn smith to say mattox 
had exceeded the bounds of decency 
at issue was an answer ms richards gave during the televised 
debate ms richards said she would veto a bill that would forbid 
abortions for girls 16 years of age or younger 
no legislator no judge and no bureaucrat has any business in 
determining whether a white woman has an abortion or not she 
appeared to say 
after the debate ms richards said she didnt recall exactly 
what word she used but added that white women is not a 
phrase that i use i think what i said was why women 
smith insisted thursday that ms richards was saying whether 
or why a woman in her answer 
but mattox said that his opponent had offended many texans 
based on the comments last night and based on the calls that 
have been coming into my office ms richards owes the black and 
hispanic communities of texas an apology its very clear that 
in her mindset that she represents the white feminist fringe in 
texas mattox told a houston news conference thursday 
smith said mattox was panicking because of polls showing him 
running third among democrats in the march 13 primary incumbent 
republican gov bill clements is retiring 
mattox is acting desperate but this goes beyond the bounds of 
decency smith said adding that mattox should be criticized for 
injecting race into the campaign 
neither mattox nor the third leading democratic candidate 
former gov mark white nor a panel of journalists questioned ms 
richards about the remark during their debate the subject was 
raised during a postdebate news conference 
a spokesman for white called for clarification thursday 
i dont think ann intended to make a racial slur however i 
think that she needs to clarify what she said said gary rasp 
whites press secretary 
ms richards made the keynote address during the 1988 democratic 
convention and poked fun at thengop presidential candidate george 
bush saying he was born with a silver foot in his mouth

nonunion truck drivers waited until federal 
marshals left before taunting union strikers outside a coal 
preparation plant wracked by confrontations between the two sides 
the chief marshal says 
chief us marshal walt biondi said the taunts were witnessed by 
a deputy marshal who hid in a picket shack at rum creek coal sales 
inc to see what would happen after the other marshals left 
im extremely angry that after all weve tried to do to calm 
the situation in the last two weeks that this has happened 
biondi said 
the chief marshal said he was told that the drivers made lewd 
gestures to the strikers and used obscene language 
it just incenses me that something like this could occur 
biondi said i was particularly angered after risking the safety 
of my people and the reputation of my people down there to restore 
calm 
the united mine workers have been picketing the rum creek coal 
plant since it reopened in august with nonunion contractor 
conserv inc running it a nonunion trucking company also is used 
to haul coal from the facility which previously was worked by 
union employees 
last month strikers tried to block a bridge leading into the 
plant with their cars and truck drivers for several days pushed 
through the barricade damaging cars and injuring several strikers 
the union criticized federal marshals for not stopping the 
trucks and claimed the government was siding with rum creek coal 
sales a charge biondi has denied 
a umw official said thursdays incident supports the unions 
longstanding accusations about companyprovoked violence 
what weve been alleging all along is that these people are 
there to provoke us said howard green the district 17 
international executive board representative 
conserv vice president mike holbrook said he doesnt condone 
the truckers action but understands it 
both sides do it i get the finger daily every time i cross 
the picket line thats just a fact of life on rum creek 
holbrook said 
the umw and rum creek coal sales are holding closeddoor 
negotiations aimed at settling the dispute

most of the 31 senators up for reelection in 
november began the year with bulging campaign war chests with 
nearly half having at least 1 million on hand and one a whopping 
6 million 
the fundraising kingpin was republican phil gramm of texas who 
has raised more than 10 million since his 1984 election and began 
the year with 61 million according to reports filed with the 
federal election commission 
an analysis of those reports released friday by common cause 
said political action committees have played a significant role in 
helping incumbents gain huge fundraising edges over most potential 
challengers 
indeed 25 of the 31 senators facing reelection this year have 
accepted pac donations that would exceed pac contribution limits 
included in a campaign finance reform proposal being pushed by the 
public interest group 
the closest senator to gramm in terms of fundraising prowess 
was new jersey democrat bill bradley who is expected to coast to 
reelection and is often mentioned as a possible presidential 
contender in 1992 
bradley told the fec he had 41 million on hand as of dec 31 
the poorest of the 31 was sen nancy landon kassebaum rkan 
who has raised just 90860 since 1984 and began 1990 with 157817 
in campaign funds 
a breakdown of pac donations provided in the common cause 
analysis supports the organizations claim that pacs are providing 
hefty assistance to most incumbents 
of the 14 senators who began the year with more than 1 million 
democrat david boren of oklahoma was the only one who has not 
accepted any pac donations of all 31 only boren and democrat john 
kerry of massachusetts who had 874000 in campaign funds as of 
dec 31 accepted no pac money 
of the 29 whose campaigns took pac money gramm was again the 
leader receiving 11 million from pacs in the last six years 
according to common cause illinois democrat paul simon was not far 
behind reporting 976769 in pac contributions since the 1984 
election 
at the bottom of the pac list except for boren and kerry was 
kassebaum who has accepted 19250 from pacs since 1984 
simon faces a tough challenge from republican rep lynn martin 
who leads all senate challengers with about 800000 in campaign 
funds three other house republicans challenging or expected to 
challenge incumbent democratic senators bill schuette of michigan 
thomas tauke of iowa and claudine schneider of rhode island 
trailed the incumbents in fundraising but not by as large a margin 
as most of the lesserknown challengers 
schuette who faces a primary in his effort to challenge sen 
carl levin had about 350000 on hand to begin the year while 
levin had 23 million tauke trying to unseat sen tom harkin 
had 300000 to beging the year while harkin had 11 million 
schneider began the year with about 540000 in the bank not 
far behind sen claiborne pell who had nearly 650000 schneider 
is expected to announce her candidacy soon 
common cause said the 31 incumbent senators together raised 
774 million since all but one last faced election six years ago 
with 166 million of that total coming from pacs 
the only senator in the group not involved in a 1984 senate 
election was republican dan coats of indiana who 13 months ago was 
appointed to fill the seat vacated by vice president dan quayle

he spoke as a report by the national conference of state 
legislatures said that half of the states face deficits or 
unexpectedly low revenues 
at the same time only a few of these states are likely to 
resort to electionyear tax increases the conference said in its 
report 
bush told the state lawmakers not to expect quick fixes from 
washington for pressing problems 
he noted his new federal budget contains increased money for 
education and for financing experimentation in the states 
and he promised to help find ways of making federal regulations 
less burdensome on states more federal money should not in my 
view automatically mean more federal management he said 
but bush said that in the long run more political power needs 
to be returned to the states vowing further implementation of 
this broad philosophical commitment to federalism 
federalism is the word the reagan administration used for a 
variety of proposals to transfer programs and the associated 
costs from the federal government to states 
in its report on state finances halfway through the 1990 fiscal 
year the organization of state legislatures said on thursday that 
slower revenue growth in the states is attributable to both 
regional economic problems and a general slowdown 
the most severe financial problems are in the northeast and new 
england states but midaltantic and southeastern states face 
shortfalls as well 
funding for education for medicaid and for expanding prison 
capacity will be at the top of the agendas in many states said 
lee daniels a republican who is president of the national 
conference of state legislatures and minority leader of the 
illinois house 
but finding funds for these purposes will be more difficult 
than in the past few years with half the states reporting slow 
economic growth is reducing revenue below projections for the 
current fiscal year he said 
the conference an organization of lawmakers from all 50 states 
released its report on state fiscal conditions as it held a 
leadership meeting in washington 
only a few states are likely to impose electionyear tax 
increases the group said but it predicted more tax increases in 
1991 particularly if the economy declines 
the report said potential deficits are expected by the end of 
fiscal 1990 in massachusetts vermont new hampshire rhode island 
new york new jersey virginia and west virginia 
massachusetts where gov michael dukakis pointed to as an 
example of strong economic growth when he was the 1988 democratic 
presidential nominee suffers the states most spectacular 
problems according to the report its deficit may reach 10 
percent despite tax increases last year 
in all of those states governors and legislatures have moved to 
reduce spending and some are considering increased taxes the group 
said 
arizona and a few midwest states joined the southeast and 
midatlantic states in facing possible revenue shortfalls in fiscal 
1990 that is revenue collections are running below projections 
although reserves may be sufficient to make up the difference 
those states were maine connecticut pennsylvania north 
carolina south carolina georgia tennessee alabama mississippi 
florida missouri kansas minnesota michigan north dakota 
montana wyoming and arizona 
the recession that has crippled budgets in the northeastern 
states remains regional but a slowing revenue stream is creating 
difficulties for most of the midatlantic and southeastern states 
as well the report said far western states are generally in 
good condition as are many of the states in the nations 
heartland 
some of the farm states that faced economic hardship and tax 
increases in the 1980s have seen an upturn the report said energy 
states which saw their state finances crash with their economies 
in the 1980s are stabilizing the report said although it said 
louisianas 1990 surplus was based on temporary tax measures 
the report said significant tax increases are likely in 1990 in 
massachusetts new jersey new york louisiana and arizona 
kentucky oklahoma and texas are considering increases for public 
education

middleaged blacks die at a rate more than twice 
that of whites but income is a major factor in the difference 
according to a government study published today 
a 13year study by the national centers for disease control in 
atlanta found that blacks between the ages of 35 and 54 die at a 
rate 25 times greater than that of whites in the same age group 
according to a report in the journal of the american medical 
association 
it said 38 percent of the difference in the death rates between 
the races can be attributed to income disparity 
thats a big proportion to be concerned about because its not 
something that public health workers and physicians can do much 
about said dr mac w otten an epidemiologist at the cdc and 
one of the authors of the study 
those are issues for health policy makers and political 
officials otten said in a telephone interview thursday night 
we need health policy makers to seriously study those factors 
related to income 
otten said lowerincome people may have less access to 
prevention services such as screening for cervical cancer with pap 
smears or for breast cancer with mammograms screening for 
diseases like diabetes or hypertension disease prevention programs 
for weight control or stopping smoking and educational efforts to 
reduce risks that can be prevented 
the study said another 31 percent of the difference in the death 
rate for blacks can be explained by their higher incidence of 
disease from preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure 
alcohol consumption and smoking 
researchers said the other 31 percent of the difference in death 
rates is unexplained though part of it may be due to lack of 
access to health care or factors they didnt study such as 
exercise 
he said researchers studied data collected between 1971 and 1984 
from 8806 black and white amercans living in rural and nonrural 
areas and in communities of all sizes 
the causes of death among blacks were the same as in the 
general population heart disease strokes cancer and so on 
they are dying of the same things only at higher rates otten 
said violence and homicides did not contribute to the excess 
death rate 
otten said researchers adjusted death rates within the study 
group for family income and for the preventable risk factors of 
smoking blood pressure weight diabetes cholesterol level and 
alcohol intake to come up with their conclusion 
it has been known that blacks in most age groups die at rates 
much higher than those of whites 
but the national study broke ground by quantifying the 
importance income plays in the different death rates between the 
races otten said the study also marked the first time the effects 
of high blood pressure diabetes and other risk factors were 
quantified to explain the difference in death rates he said 
black medical leaders around the country said thursday that the 
study will help overcome the perception that blacks lead 
unhealthier lifestyles 
the time has come to consider universal entitlement to health 
care in this country said dr james a goodman president of 
atlantas predominantly black morehouse school of medicine 
dr bailus walker former president of the american public 
health association said that povertys dominant role in preventing 
access to health care means that tinkering with the system 
expanding medicaid to this group granting catastrophic care to 
that group will no longer work

del shannon whose distinctive 
falsetto style on such rock classics as runaway and keep 
searchin pushed him to the top of the charts in the 1960s was 
found dead in his home from an apparent selfinflicted gunshot 
wound authorities said today he was 55 
shannons wife bonnie found her singersongwriter husbands 
body at about 1125 pm thursday with a bullet wound to the head 
said los angeles county sheriffs deputy roger hom 
a 22caliber rifle was found next to shannons body in the den 
hom said he said the death was being investigated as a possible 
suicide but the exact cause of death had not been established by 
coroners officials 
shannon was born charles westover in grand rapids mich on 
dec 30 1934 according to coroners spokesman bob dambacher 
dambacher said an autopsy would be conducted over the weekend 
shannons first and biggest hit was runaway recorded 
shortly after his discovery by detroit agents harry balk and irving 
micahnik as with many of his songs it dealt with the pain of 
young love gone astray 
the single made no 1 in the united states in early 1961 
his other top 20 singles included hats off to larry 
little town flirt and keep searchin 
shannons popularity declined in the mid1960s but english duo 
peter and gordon gained success with his i go to pieces 
he tried varying his sharp early 1960s sound by recording with 
producer andrew loog oldham toward the end of the decade but it 
was a commercial failure 
in 1982 he signed a new contract with elektra records which 
released his album drop down and get me produced by longtime 
admirer tom petty that album met with critical approval but did 
not sell significantly in 1986 television producer michael mann 
had shannon rerecord runaway with new lyrics for the series 
crime story 
in a recent interview he discussed the stress of having a flash 
of fame in the music industry 
this business will eat you up he said if it becomes your 
love and you dont have humans to love i think youre in a lot of 
trouble

black protesters spent the night in city hall 
and selma high school then locked the doors of the school this 
morning while all public schools in the city were closed for a 
third day because of a racial protest 
police said they had no reports of problems during the night 
during which about 150 black students and adults some in sleeping 
bags camped out in the high school cafeteria about 50 others 
spent the night in city hall 
police made no immediate effort to enter the high school this 
morning after the protesters locked the doors jl chestnut a 
selma lawyer helping negotiate for the protesters urged caution 
if they go in there to arrest somebody all kinds of things 
may very well happen said chestnut 
black protests have escalated since six white members of the 
11member selma school board voted last week to dismiss schools 
superintendent norward roussell who is black 
the board voted tuesday to rescind its action but by then the 
protests had widened to include other issues including police 
treatment of a woman protesting the superintendants ouster 
on thursday school officials announced that all 11 public 
schools would remain closed until monday 
thursday night a mostly white group of nearly 1000 parents 
arrived at the high school for a meeting but had to go to another 
school because black students blocked the entrances to the high 
school witnesses said there was no friction between the two groups 
diane crisman a leader of the parents group said we were 
just told by some adults that that group had as much right to 
occupy the building as we had to meet there 
rose sanders a black protest leader who claimed a white 
policeman abused her during an arrest monday said the protest 
should spotlight education as next months 25th anniversary of the 
1965 selmatomontgomery voting rights march approaches 
i think the focus has to be on separate and unequal 
education said mrs sanders a selma lawyer 
she has said officer ronnie rushing touched her private 
parts with his billy stick as she was dragged to police 
headquarters earlier this week 
mayor joe smitherman said a report would be released this 
afternoon on the arrest of mrs sanders and three others on 
misdemeanor charges after they entered his offices to protest the 
dismissal of roussell he said rushing had been reassigned pending 
an investigation of the confrontation 
the mayor earlier said rushing was injured by mrs sanders when 
she forced police to physically remove her from city hall mrs 
sanders was briefly hospitalized after the incident 
scores of blacks crowded into city hall corridors thursday 
promising not to leave until rushing is suspended hundreds of 
students and adults settled in at selma high 
we as students are sick and tired of being sick and tired 
catrena norris a 1986 graduate of the high school told the selma 
timesjournal were here and we wont leave until our demands 
are met 
mrs sanders was released thursday as protest leaders turned the 
spotlight on her case her husband state sen hank sanders has 
said he would use any means necessary to personally respond to 
abuse of his wife 
i admire what hes doing as a husband but i dont think we 
can lose sight of the issue mrs sanders said the issue is 
not roussell not me because many communities have the same 
problem unequal education im hoping other people will take a 
close look at their school systems

a committee of blacks has sued the county 
school board charging the district discriminates against minority 
middle school children 
the lawsuit by the committee of organized groups asks that the 
district give every black middle school student an individualized 
education plan 
what has become clear is that in regular education 
particularly black and hispanic children are simply ignored said 
attorney gabe kaimowitz who filed the lawsuit thursday in federal 
court in orlando 
the individual plans created by guidance counselors parents and 
psychologists now are written only for students in 
specialeducation classes the committee wants similar plans for 
black middle school students to eliminate the last vestiges of 
the dual school system said kaimowitz 
orange county middle schools have about 22000 students and 
about 24 percent are black 
superintendent james schott said writing individual plans would 
be costly and cumbersome 
kindergartners and new students up to third grade are evaluated 
and placed depending on their needs schott said teachers and 
counselors do similar evaulations throughout a students schooling

the head of a national chiropractors group today 
hailed a appeals courts decision to uphold a 1987 ruling that the 
american medical association illegally attempted to destroy his 
profession 
the ruling will make up for years of oppression chiropractors 
have suffered from the ama louis sportelli chairman of the 
american chiropractic association said in a telephone interview 
today 
theres no question about the fact that the ruling paves the 
way for chiropractic to proceed without hindrance sportelli said 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals on wednesday affirmed the 
finding of us district judge susan getzendanner who found the 
ama boycott of chiropractors to be in violation of antitrust law 
she permanently barred the nations largest organization of 
physicians from boycotting chiropractors who treat patients with 
physical manipulation focused on the spine 
the experience of the ama in this case should now put other 
medical associations and hospitals dominated by them on notice 
that chiropractors will fight for the rights of their patients 
said attorney george mcandrews who represented the chiropractors 
those rights include fair treatment by hospitals insurance 
plans and other groups that have limited patients access to 
chiropractors mcandrews said 
the ama has not decided whether to appeal the case further said 
association attorney kirk johnson 
although the ama disagrees with the court of appeals decision 
the ruling should have no material impact on physicians or 
patients he said in a statement 
after an eightweek trial ms getzendanner issued a permanent 
injunction on sept 25 1987 barring the ama from restricting 
regulating or impeding its 275000 members or the hospitals where 
they work from associating with chiropractors 
the judge said the ama had proved it was motivated mostly by 
sincere concern about whether chiropractic was scientifically 
valid though evidence indicated there was also selfish economic 
reasons behind it 
a threejudge appellate panel which heard arguments in the case 
in december unanimously agreed saying ms getzendanner had 
reached a reasonable decision in granting the injunction 
at the time of her ruling ms getzendanner also directed the 
ama to publish a copy of her ninepage order in the journal of the 
american medical association and to separately mail all of its 
members and employees copies of the order 
she also required that the ama amend its current opinions of the 
council on ethical and judicial affairs the groups guidelines on 
ethical behavior to reflect that it is ethical for medical doctors 
to associate with chiropractors 
the ama printed the ruling in the ama journal but was granted a 
delay on the other two requirements pending appeal 
the lawsuit filed in 1977 by four chiropractors in four 
different states sought no monetary damages but challenged the 
refusal of medical doctors to acknowledge chiropractors 
professional abilities 
there are about 45000 chiropractors in the united states 
according to the american chiropractic association 
chiropractors are required to finish two years of college plus 
four years of chiropractic college 
the ama has said previously that during the 1960s it advised 
physicians not to refer patients to chiropractors because the group 
believed some of their treatments had no scientific basis 
the policy was prompted by concern for patient safety not by 
doctors fears of competition from chiropractors the ama said 
even so the policy was abandoned in 1980 the ama has 
maintained

east germany is only days away from 
economic collapse a west german official said today but east 
germany denied the grim assessment 
a west german government spokesman later also said east germany 
is not in danger of collapsing in the next few days but that some 
west german leaders believe that is the case 
there was no clear reason for the conflicting assessments from 
bonn where officials have different opinions about how to bail out 
the neighboring country and the pace of reunifying the nations 
earlier today a senior government official speaking to 
reporters on the condition of anonymity said the east german 
economy has moved to the point where insolvency could be within a 
few days 
that would mean the communist nation where the government owns 
virtually all components of the economy would be unable to pay 
workers or make payments on its foreign debt 
the official in bonn said chancellor helmut kohl would address 
the situation during his weekend visit to moscow where he will 
meet with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
later east german government spokesman wolfgang meyer denied 
that his communistled nation is in such dire circumstances 
bonn government spokesman hans klein also issued a statement 
saying that bonn was not officially predicting an east german 
collapse 
the federal government is not of the opinion that east germany 
in the next days will be insolvent klein said but he noted that 
some individual leaders fear such extreme possibilities 
the plummeting economy has hastened and been worsened by the 
mass immigration of east germans to west germany the crisis 
spurred mass unrest last year that toppled the hardline communist 
regime 
the interim communist government says it will hold free 
elections on march 18 when a new government is likely to take 
control but it appears likely that that government instead of 
being the answer to east germanys future will oversee the 
transition to reunification of the germanys 
kohl has been pressing for a combining of the two countrys 
currencies to give the east germans a palpable reason to stay home 
bundesbank president karlotto poehl the chief of west 
germanys central bank told reporters in bonn today that such a 
monetary union most likely the circulation of west german 
currency in the east will require major sacrifices by both 
countries 
but poehl who earlier had cautioned against giving east germany 
a quick monetary fix appeared to soften his stand he said west 
germany could afford merging currencies with east germany and may 
in fact have little choice 
some europeans fear a united germany could again become a 
military threat 
in a speech in the east german city of potsdam outside berlin 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher sought to allay 
european fears by saying that both nations should soon sign an 
agreement not to build nuclear weapons or encroach on the borders 
of neighboring countries 
the superpowers worry that such a union could crumble their 
military alliances nato has about 255000 troops in west germany 
most of them americans more than 380000 soviet soldiers are 
stationed in east germany a key member of the warsaw pact 
east germany premier hans modrow has proposed that a united 
germany be neutral but western nations have uniformly rejected 
that stand 
in paris foreign minister roland dumas said in an interview 
published today that france does not oppose the reunification of 
germany but is against a neutral germany which he said would lead 
to european instability 
officials in bonn have proposed that what is now west germany 
could remain with nato and the territory that was east germany 
could technically be nuetral 
kohls talks with gorbachev no doubt will deal with the 
willingness of the soviet union to accept the loss of perhaps the 
key component of its military strategy

the federal exportimport bank is making a 
104 million grant to help china build a subway in shanghai the 
bank announced friday 
the grant will be part of a 231 million financing package to 
encourage the chinese government to buy equipment from american 
companies against competition from similar subsidies offered by 
france and west germany 
had eximbank not finalized its financing at this time the 
contracts won by american companies would have been jeopardized 
the us announcement said 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger earlier this week 
went before committees of congress to defend the bush 
administration on its china policy members from both parties have 
accused president bush of being too quick to lift sanctions against 
the chinese government after its bloody suppression of the movement 
for democracy 
the us grant will come from a 1095 million war chest 
being used in china for the first time congress voted the money to 
help us businesses compete against similar government subsidies 
from japan west germany france and other industrial countries 
jeni falkiewicz public affairs officer for the bank said the 
french and west german offers to china violated an international 
agreement the agreement was designed to limit the subsidies given 
by governments of industrial countries to promote foreign sales 
the rest of the us financing package will consist of a 
guarantee from the government bank of a 127 million loan to the 
private export funding corp which works closely with it because 
of the guarantee the corporation can offer easier terms to the 
chinese government than would otherwise be available in this 
country 
ms falkiewicz said the bank is also working with the us 
agency for international development aid to finance export deals 
with money appropriated to help raise living standards in poor 
countries competing governments also use aid funds in this way 
the banks announcement said major contracts for the shanghai 
subway were awarded to west german suppliers after a financing 
offer that included a grant of 732 percent while the us grant 
accounts for only 45 percent the french won a contract for 
tunneling equipment while us companies were chosen for 
signaling fire alarm detection and other systems 
the biggest us exporter is general railway signal inc of 
rochester ny 
officials who spoke on condition that they not be named said 
criticism in congress led to a us request to the world bank to 
postpone until feb 27 its consideration of a 60 million loan to 
help chinas farmers 
a treasury department spokesman robert levine said he could 
neither confirm nor deny that the postponement was sought by the 
united states the world bank is owned by 151 governments and is 
the biggest source of aid to the third world this loan would be 
part of a 780 million package that bank president barber conable 
postponed in june just after chinese government tanks went into 
tiananmen square bush later asked that these loans be held up 
a 30 million world bank loan to china announced on thursday was 
for relief of an earthquake that occurred in october and so was not 
part of the package

the world health organization plans a 
new campaign to fight aids in east european countries which only 
recently began reporting cases of the deadly disease officials 
said friday 
dr jonathan mann head of the un agencys aids program said 
east bloc countries form the new frontiers of the global 
epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of victims 
primarily in the americas africa and west europe 
during a news conference he urged the new governments that came 
to power in the eastern european prodemocracy movement to help the 
campaign by looking at aids as a health rather than an 
ideological issue 
he told a news conference that romania was expected to be the 
worst hit country in eastern europe because of the large number of 
children infected by contaminated blood and needles 
but he said who was also concerned about developments in other 
countries citing signs that drug users in poland have become 
infected with the hiv virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
dr david heymann a who specialist who returned late thursday 
from a visit to bucharest said about one third of 1500 romanian 
children screened for the disease were infected with the hiv virus 
mann said another who team will travel to romania next week to 
begin making plans for a program to fight the disease there the 
who campaign for all of eastern europe will officially be launched 
at the end of february he said 
heymann said that at the beginning of february romanian 
authorities had reported 74 cases of aids including 50 children 
those figures are likely to increase once testing for the disease 
is more widespread the doctor said 
priorities of the who campaign include improving medical care in 
east european countries ensuring the use of sterile needles in 
hospitals counseling for victims and their families and providing 
better training of medical workers 
who has already sent 100000 screening kits to romania as 
initial assistance to help authorities determine the true extent of 
aids in their country 
mann stressed the need for a nationwide education program to 
publicize the risks of aids which was long concealed by the regime 
of former dictator nicolae ceausescu who was overthrown dec 22 
romania shows the dangers of the silence on aids he said 
aids is often spread through sharing of needles or syringes by 
drug abusers hardline communist leaders of the past viewed drug 
abuse as a western problem that did not affect them 
a private organization doctors of the world said this week 
that romania is in the grips of the first known epidemic of aids in 
children because of the backward practices in its hospitals 
mann said that by the end of 1989 about 300 aids cases had been 
reported from all eastern european countries albania was the only 
country in the region with no registered cases 
worldwide more than 215000 cases of aids had been reported to 
who by the end of last month however many cases go unreported 
aids attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a variety of infections and cancers 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

since 1956 the government has 
charged helen joseph with treason detained her repeatedly placed 
her under house arrest and made it a crime to quote her 
but the 84yearold white antiapartheid activist survived 34 
years of bannings and on feb 2 became one of nearly 500 people 
living and dead whose restrictions were lifted by president fw 
de klerk 
i didnt think id see this day mrs joseph said adding 
that she was a bit disappointed the government no longer considered 
her a threat im a stubborn old bag and i wasnt expecting 
things to change 
police restrictions have been a way of life for many 
antiapartheid activists hundreds detained without charge during 
the 3yearold state of emergency were released but then placed 
under virtual house arrest 
the restrictions varied but often prohibited the activists from 
leaving their neighborhoods required them to be home each night 
prevented them from attending meetings or participating in 
politics and often made it impossible to hold a job 
zwelakhe sisulu son of recently released african national 
congress leader walter sisulu was freed from prison in december 
1988 after two years in detention but he had to report daily to 
police and was unable to resume his job as editor of the new nation 
newspaper until de klerk rescinded his restriction order 
few have endured as much as mrs joseph a former social worker 
and union official now confined to a wheelchair much of the time 
the government charged mrs joseph anc leader nelson mandela 
and more than 150 others with treason in 1956 for their 
antiapartheid activities all were acquitted in a trial that 
lasted until 1961 
however mrs joseph a divorcee with no children remained 
under a banning order and in 1962 became the first south african 
placed under house arrest for the next nine years police were the 
only visitors allowed to enter her comfortable white house with a 
red roof and a flowerfilled garden in a johannesburg suburb 
her house arrest ended in 1971 while she was undergoing a cancer 
operation but until feb 2 she remained a listed person 
meaning she could not be quoted in south africa 
she has been arrested numerous times most recently in 1983 when 
she sang a freedom song and gave a clenchedfist black power 
salute while attending a treason trial 
as part of his reform program de klerk lifted the police orders 
on 374 people who had been restricted after their release from 
detention he also removed the names of all 110 people who had been 
listed and could not be quoted many of the listed people are 
either dead or have left south africa they include 
most of the african national congress leadership such as 
president oliver tambo who is recovering from a stroke in sweden 
donald woods whose book cry freedom about the life and 
death of black activist steve biko was made into a movie by the 
same name three years ago woods now lives in london 
numerous whites including anne heymann who died of pneumonia 
feb 3 at the age of 66 and her husband isaac heymann who died 
of cancer four days later at the age of 79 
the heymanns both listed since the 1960s lived only a few 
blocks from mrs joseph and often visited her at her front gate 
during the years when she wasnt allowed guests inside her home 
so many people suffered for so many years mrs joseph said 
im not grateful for the lifting of the restrictions it was 
not an act of compassion it never should have been done in the 
first place 
despite failing health she occasionally travels to 
antigovernment protests such as an anc rally last october in the 
township of soweto where she received a rousing cheer from the 
mostly black crowd of 70000 
mrs joseph whose requests to visit mandela were repeatedly 
denied finally was granted permission and the two met last dec 21 
for the first time in 28 years 
he looked different after so many years but then so did i 
mrs joseph said he was in very good form full of jokes full 
of laughter 
four days later mrs joseph had christmas dinner with walter 
sisulu and dozens of other activists at the home of a friend 
after her house arrest was lifted she began a tradition of 
making a toast at noon on christmas to remember all the 
antiapartheid activists who were in exile in prison or had died 
word of the tradition had spread to exiles and prisoners and 
sisulu told mrs joseph it was observed during his years in jail 
she hopes one day all the activists will be able to hold a 
christmas toast together in south africa but she doubts shell be 
around to take part 
i dont think ill see the end of apartheid but ill see it 
diminish she said you cant wash away 300 years of cruelty 
and injustice overnight

record price increases for vegetables and fuel 
oil combined in january to produce the highest monthly wholesale 
inflation rate in 15 years a temporary spurt economists attributed 
to the holiday cold snap 
the labor departments producer price index soared a seasonally 
adjusted 18 percent last month the sharpest rise since a 2 
percent gain in november 1974 in the midst of the opec oil embargo 
january energy prices rocketed 136 percent for the largest 
monthly gain on record since the department began tracking the 
sector in 1974 food costs jumped 21 percent the biggest increase 
in six years 
the months overall price climb was triple the already brisk 06 
percent gain in december and far above economists average forecast 
of about 12 percent 
if wholesale inflation persisted at the january pace it would 
produce an annual price rise of 241 percent in 1990 
however economists expressed little worry and stock and bond 
prices actually rose immediately after the report because the 
core rate of inflation prices of goods excluding food and 
energy rose a slight 01 percent the core rate is viewed as a 
better measure of underlying inflationary pressure 
economists warn that the wholesale food and energy jolt is 
filtering through to consumers and is likely to push up the 
consumer price index the bestknown inflation measure but the 
effect at both the retail and wholesale levels will be temporary 
they said 
analysts are predicting the wholesale inflation rate which more 
than doubled between 1988 and 1989 from 22 percent to 48 percent 
will retreat to about 4 percent this year 
without food and energy commodity price inflation was very 
low in january said economist allen sinai of the boston co 
the report suggests much of the activity was weatherrelated and 
will diminish in coming months 
as temperatures plummeted fuel oil prices rose a startling 253 
percent the biggest jump on record as refineries switched 
production to fuel oil supplies of gasoline grew short sending 
those prices up 167 percent natural gas costs rose a brisk 32 
percent 
the price of fresh and dried vegetable rose 58 percent for the 
month the largest seasonally adjusted gain recorded since the 
department began tracking that category in 1967 prices for 
cabbage lettuce and tomatoes more than doubled while snap beans 
and dried beans nearly doubled the department said 
it was snowing in brownsville texas and orlando fla on 
the same day i doubt that ever happened before that means we lost 
both the texas and florida vegetable crops said economist 
donald ratajczak of georgia state university 
egg fruit and fish prices also rose while rice pasta chicken 
and turkey costs fell 
in other categories wholesale prices rose 29 percent for 
childrens clothing 08 percent for mens and womens clothing 
and 09 percent for home electronic equipment 
ratajczak suggested the decline in the value of the dollar since 
fall could be behind the increase in the cost of clothing much of 
which is imported 
balancing that were drops of 13 percent for tobacco which had 
risen 22 percent in december and 07 percent for automobiles the 
result of a new round of discounting at auto dealerships 
the various changes put the producer price index at 1175 in 
january this meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods 
which cost 100 at the wholesale level in 1982 cost 11750 last 
month up from 11110 a year earlier 
soaring energy costs also drove up inflation in earlier stages 
of the production process the price of intermediate goods rose 12 
percent overall but only 01 percent excluding food and energy 
the price of crude goods was up 24 percent overall and 02 percent 
minus food and energy 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude

college officials who gathered at a 
conference on black fraternity and sorority hazing said friday 
their goal was to end the practice which one speaker called a form 
of selfhatred 
it is a realistic goal that speaks directly to the issue 
of self determination said eric abercrumbie director of 
minority programs and affairs at the university of cincinnati 
speakers at the twoday conference at hampton university defined 
hazing as the physical psychological or financial intimidation or 
abuse of pledges to the social groups before they are initiated 
i dont find it necessary to first dehumanize a person then 
turn around at a later time and call him brother said carroll 
hardy dean of minority affairs at the college of william and mary 
in williamsburg 
organizers of the event which drew about 400 college officials 
and students said they hoped to find alternatives to hazing 
students at the conference planned to discuss the issue saturday 
manning marable a professor of political science and sociology 
at the university of colorado told the group that blacks must 
build strong organizations with a new vision of brotherhood and 
sisterhood is hazing is violence like this the kind of 
example we want to set 
abercrumbie said hazing is a form of selfhate his experience 
was that groups that used hazing to strengthen their feeling of 
cohesiveness generally pledged people who did not graduate and who 
had problems with drug abuse 
penny saffold dean of students at san francisco state 
university said fraternities and sororities are being asked to 
change our community is in a state of crisis we need crisis 
measures somewhere along the line many of our chapters have 
forgotten the ideals that established their organization we need 
to talk about what the fraternities and sororities can do to help 
the africanamerican community 
last year a morehouse college student died in a hazing 
incident raymond e crawford the schools vice president of 
student affairs said pledging of fraternity and sorority members 
has been suspended at the georgia school until a commission can 
decide whether there is a role at morehouse for the groups 
college administrators said the fraternities and sororities need 
to replace hazing with community service and a dedication to 
academic excellence 
we need to ask what are the kinds of initiations what are the 
kinds of preparations for leadership that we need for our 
community we need leaders who are more passionate more 
courageous more willing to take on the odds said vincent 
harding professor of religion and social transformation at the 
iliff school of theology in denver colo

hungary on friday became the second 
soviet bloc nation to reestablish diplomatic ties with the vatican 
that were severed more than four decades ago 
the agreement was signed in parliament by hungarian premier 
miklos nemeth and cardinal agostino casaroli the vatican secretary 
of state 
nemeth told a news conference that a nuncio would represent the 
vatican in hungary and that budapest will send an ambassador to the 
vatican 
restoration of relations will also contribute to the success 
of pope john paul iis visit in 1991 said nemeth 
cardinal casaroli said that by restoring relations both 
parties wanted to show that this move is in their mutual interest 
hungary follows poland which restored vatican ties in july 
other east bloc nations are likely to do the same following 
revolutions that ousted hardline communist governments and cleared 
the way for westernstyle reforms 
casaroli who arrived here wednesday on a fiveday visit also 
said the agreement signed friday will not jeopardize the autonomy 
of the churches but rather will serve to protect and strengthen 
their autonomy 
the restoration of diplomatic ties with the vatican comes after 
hungary abolished restrictive laws on religion as part of the 
countrys move toward democracy 
relations between hungary and the vatican were broken after the 
government expelled the vaticans envoy in 1945 
the hungarian roman catholic church gave in to pressure from the 
stalinist leadership aug 30 1950 agreeing to surrender its 
autonomy 
nemeth recalled that in 1964 the two sides signed a partial 
agreement which reflected our differences but also contained 
agreements which made further cooperation possible 
despite the differences the dialogue between the vatican and 
hungary always had its sincere adherents nemeth said 
negotiations between hungary which has a roman catholic 
majority and the vatican had been going on for months 
casaroli jointly celebrated mass on thursday with hungarian 
cardinal laszlo paskai in the basilica at esztergom the seat of 
hungarys roman catholic primate 
at a ceremony following the mass interim president matyas 
szueroes denounced the trial of cardinal jozsef mindszenty under 
stalinist rule as a show trial marking the late primates de 
facto rehabilitation 
in reply to a question friday about confiscated church assets 
nemeth said i myself raised the matter in our talks the 
government is seeking ways of returning the illegally seized church 
assets this will be done gradually and in ongoing consultations 
with the churches 
parliament enacted a law jan 24 that separates church and 
state ending state interference in church affairs and granting all 
denominations full autonomy 
commenting on the pontiffs visit to czechoslovakia in april 
this year casaroli said it would be a brief one while the 
hungarian trip would be a full apostolic visit 
czechoslovakia was more isolated from the holy see and 
therefore it was deemed desirable to make an early brief visit 
he said

salman rushdie must be killed as the 
late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered for blaspheming islam and 
the prophet mohammed in his novel the satanic verses irans 
new spiritual leader said friday 
in britain prime minister margaret thatcher said the 
announcement by ayatollah ali khamenei was much to be 
regretted a friend of the british novelist called it a rejection 
of rushdies recent peace overtures to moslems 
there was no immediate comment from rushdie who has been in 
hiding since khomeini declared the novel blasphemous and decreed on 
feb 14 1989 that faithful moslems should kill its author 
several iranian leaders put a pricce on the writers head of 52 
million 
khomeini died in june but the death sentence was not lifted on 
friday his successor as spiritual leader of irans shiite moslems 
said the religious decree about the writer of the blasphemous 
book the satanic verses is still valid and must be implemented 
tehran radio said he made the statement in a sermon at weekly 
prayers on the moslem sabbath 
rushdie who was born in india to moslem parents said this week 
he had considered appearing in public to deliver a lecture on 
censorship but his police guards dissuaded him 
in a 7000word essay published in the british newspaper 
independent on sunday and in an interview earlier this week with 
newsweek magazine rushdie expressed regret for the pain the book 
had caused but said he stood by it 
he said he was pressing for a paperback edition and declared 
that charges of reneging on his faith were invalid because he had 
not been a practicing moslem for years 
independent on sundays literary editor blake morrison 
described the iranian position as a disappointing rebuff and told 
bbc radio it was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory 
tone adopted here would filter through to tehran 
bob gregory of viking penguin which published the satanic 
verses said that when khomeini originally announced the death 
sentence we condemned it in the strongest language we could 
think of and we do precisely the same again 
irans main opposition group condemned the reaffirmed threat to 
rushdie in a statement telexed to the associated press from its 
headquarters in baghdad iraq the mujahedeen khalq accused 
khamenei of trying to divert attention from internal conflicts in 
iran 
dr kalim siddiqi director of the moslem institute in britain 
said in an interview with british broadcasting corp television 
there is a sentence of death which will be executed by the 
political and judicial authorities of islam not by private 
citizens living in britain or anywhere else 
siddiqi said he met with khamenei in tehran this week and was 
told iran would not compromise on the death decree 
asked whether he approved of such threats siddiqi said i 
approve of it entirely it is not a death threat it is a death 
sentence passed by the highest judicial authority in the world of 
islam and it is according to islamic law 
britain and a dozen western allies recalled their ambassadors 
from tehran last year in protest all but britain have resumed 
relations 
on friday the foreign office said britain sought normal 
relations on condition iran renounced threats and violence helped 
obtain the release of british hostages held in lebanon and freed 
roger cooper a british businessman imprisoned in tehran 
nine iranians deported from britain arrived in tehran on friday 
they included an iranian television journalist an iran air 
official and seven students 
the london bureau chief of islamic republic of iran 
broadcasting identified by tehran radio only as keivanara said 
the expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the 
anniversary of the death order against salman rushdie 
britain ordered feb 1 that the nine leave within a week for 
reasons of national security it did not elaborate but similar 
previous expulsions were linked to the rushdie decree

the bush administration has completed a 
drugsummit agreement with three south american countries 
committing the united states to broad economic and military 
assistance to counteract the latin nations economic reliance on 
drugs an official said friday 
in addition to the 423 million antidrug package president bush 
is proposing for peru bolivia and colombia the administration 
will pledge to help track illegal export of usproduced firearms 
used by drug dealers and crack down on drugrelated chemical 
exports officials said 
the fournation pact also calls for bush to press other western 
nations to provide economic aid to the three andean countries said 
a south american diplomat familiar with the document 
the presidents of the four countries are expected to sign the 
agreement when they meet at the feb 15 drug summit in cartagena 
colombia 
weve got agreement on the final wording said michael skol 
deputy assistant secretary of state for south american affairs 
he described the agreement as a very comprehensive document of 
cooperation on the drug issue significant for its recognition of 
rights and responsibilities of producer and consumer countries 
without fingerpointing 
the us portion of the document closely tracks bushs national 
drug strategy plan skol said the agreement deals with the general 
categories of interdiction and military cooperation economic 
alternatives to the drug trade and efforts to get other countries 
aid in the antidrug effort 
theres a promise of asking for increased spending by 
congress but no dollar amounts in the document he said 
for the second year of his national antidrug strategy bush 
last month proposed 423 million for fiscal 1991 in total 
drugrelated spending for the andean countries in military law 
enforcement and economic assistance 
some 206 million of that is an increase in spending as part of 
a fiveyear 22 billion plan 
skol said the communique will discuss money laundering arms 
exports and extradition as well as military assistance and 
economic aid including such matters as balance of payment 
assistance and substitute crops to make up for destruction of 
lucrative fields of coca which is used to make cocaine 
he described the weapons export provisions only by saying that 
they discuss cooperation among countries on the process to make 
it work better 
a spokesman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms said 
that refers to a new us policy that will station two atf agents 
in colombia to help local law enforcement officials trace the 
origins of recovered weapons 
the policy is aimed at addressing the latin nations complaints 
about usexported arms which can be legally exported with a 
state department permit and enduser certificate falling into the 
hands of drug lords said spokesman tom hill 
the bush administration has linked aid to the drugproduction 
countries to their cooperation in the antidrug efforts 
the drugsummit communique does not spell out details of us 
military assistance to the andean countries but the latins have 
insisted it be restricted to equipment and training rather than 
direct us military involvement in interdiction said the south 
american diplomat 
there are no plans to use the military except in a training 
capacity said skol a new washington postabc poll shows a 
majority of americans 55 percent favored sending us troops to 
help the colombian military and 45 percent were opposed only 19

an american wildlife biologist embarks 
saturday for the frozen wilderness of siberia where he will begin 
a sovietamerican research project to help save the endangered 
siberian tiger the largest cat in the world 
thousands of siberian tigers used to roam asia in an area 
roughly the size of europe today fewer than 500 are fighting for 
survival in a region smaller than pennsylvania according to howard 
b quigley assistant biology professor at frostburg state 
university in western maryland 
based on the way the population has gone down in the past 100 
years if we dont take some dramatic steps we could lose this 
species in this century he said if we dont do something the 
only place you might see tigers in the year 2000 is in zoos 
the remaining siberian tigers live near the sovietchinese 
border on the east coast of the soviet union but their habitat is 
being eroded by chinese and soviets who are clearing forests for 
timber and to make room for farms and urban development 
the loss of habitat is the most important but a close second 
is that people are hunting wildlife the same prey as the 
tigers quigley said if you take away all their prey there is 
nothing for them to eat 
if we can get cooperation from both countries to develop a 
comprehensive conservation plan the tiger will be the winner 
the siberian tiger which can measure up to 12 feet from nose to 
tail has brownishyellow and burnt orange fur with black vertical 
stripes white and ivorycolored fur accents its throat belly and 
inside legs 
a fullgrown siberian tiger weighs between 450 and 800 pounds 
it is the biggest of cats bigger than the african lion often 
called the king of beasts and bigger than the bengal tiger 
the one most commonly seen in zoos and circuses african lions 
weigh up to 500 pounds bengal tigers average about 400 pounds 
humans admire the animal for its strength grace and 
independence but they also fear the tiger which has on some 
occasions attacked people generally theyre more afraid than we 
are quigley said 
during the past two decades three of the eight subspecies of 
tigers have become extinct he said there are no more caspian 
tigers roaming central asia and the javan and bali tigers in 
indonesia have died out 
the populations of bengal sumatran and indochinese tigers are 
stable but there are only 20 to 30 chinese tigers left in 
southcentral china 
there are some chinese scientists looking into the 
situation quigley said there isnt enough habitat and im 
told its hopeless 
quigley 37 is traveling to the soviet union with maurice 
hornocker director of the university of idahos wildlife research 
institute in moscow idaho the wildlife institute and frostburg 
state are helping sponsor the project which will cost an estimated 
75000 
they will fly to vladivostok a port city of 550000 just north 
of north korea and journey into the wilderness with three soviet 
scientists to survey the tigers habitat they plan to begin their 
field work 11 months from now 
the researchers plan to trap the animals and put fistsized 
transmitters attached to collars around their necks using radio 
signals they will be able to track the tigers 
the researchers want to know what the tigers eat and how far 
they roam they want to find out how often they reproduce in the 
wild and the size of their litters 
the soviet researchers have learned about all they can using 
the technology they have available to them quigley said its 
time to use modern technology to expand on our knowledge of the 
animals ecology 
the siberian tiger is one of the most impressive predators to 
ever walk the face of the earth quigley added if we as humans 
the dominant species in the world cant protect their existence 
by setting aside a tiny island where they can live how dignified 
can we say we are

college studies that stress classic 
western art and literature over works of blacks women or other 
groups are a form of white supremacy says amiri baraka 
baraka the poet and playwright also known as leroi jones told 
a university of virginia audience thursday the cultural revolution 
that accompanied the civil rights movement subsided in the last 
decade and was replaced by attitudes similar to those of the 1950s 
baraka challenged the more than 200 people in the audience to 
take an active role in turning the tables 
in his keynote address for the universitys black history month 
baraka urged students and professors to fight literary canons that 
elevate classic european art and literature above all other forms 
art and literature should not be segregated but should instead 
reflect the variety of people in the world he said 
in the 1960s we wanted a poetry that would come out of the 
library and into the streets where the people were said baraka 
in the 1950s poetry was an emotionless craft that mirrored the 
traditional values of the era he said while the catchword of the 
following decade was revolution 
we were challenging the whiteness in works of art baraka 
said 
barakas writings include 24 plays seven works of nonfiction 
and 11 books of poetry

drug policy director william j bennett on 
friday accused district of columbia officials of lackluster efforts 
in the war on drugs and a bennett aide said the city let 24 
million in federal funds slip away 
i dont know why its heresy when i say it bennett told the 
senate budget committee everybody in this town knows that this 
government is not fulfilling its responsibilities to its citizens 
the testimony came at a hearing in which democrats on the senate 
budget committee queried bennett about efforts to combat drugs in 
the district of columbia 
chairman jim sasser dtenn sought to spotlight the rampant 
problem in this city whose mayor marion barry is in a florida 
alcohol and drug clinic after his arrest on a cocaine possession 
charge an aide has said barry is being treated primarily for 
alcoholism 
sasser reminded bennett that when he became drug policy director 
a year ago he promised to make washington a test case in the fight 
against drugs that still can be bought on streetcorners only 
blocks from this capitol 
bennett said action by federal officials cannot take the place 
of local government federal initiatives cannot replace local 
initiatives 
were tired of being flogged for a problem that is not of our 
making bennett told the committee 
district police estimate that more than 60 percent of the record 
438 murders recorded in the nations capital last year were 
drugrelated 
sasser said district of columbia officials have complained that 
they have not gotten the assistance from the federal government 
promised in the early days of the drug war 
bruce l carnes director of planning budget and administration 
under bennett told the panel that the federal government has made 
a commitment to provide more than 90 million of the 102 million 
that the district sought 
he said however that despite repeated warnings district 
officials allowed 24 million in defense department funds for 
bolstering the national guard as a drugfighting tool to slip away 
through inaction 
almost every penny of that lapsed because the district did not 
draw down that money carnes told lawmakers i kept telling 
them the clock is ticking youve got to draw down that money 
or its going to lapse it lapsed 
he was asked by a reporter after the hearing if he had delivered 
his warning personally to the mayor and said he had not he was 
then asked if he had warned city administrator carol b thompson 
who is operating a caretaker government while the mayor is in 
treatment 
im not going to get into that carnes said i said it to 
various district officials 
lurma rackley a barry spokeswoman said the mayor chose to 
have no comment on mr bennett when he was here im sure that he 
would rather have mr tucker or ms thompson who are the 
administrations spokespersons on drugs handle this 
sterling tucker the citys antidrug policy coordinator was 
out of town and unavailable for comment friday a tucker aide said 
thompson did not immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment

an israeli peace activist walked out of 
prison unrepentant friday and vowed to meet again with plo chairman 
yasser arafat the crime that put him behind bars for 122 days 
i will meet arafat another dozen times abie nathan told a 
handful of supporters who gathered outside the prison gates in the 
pouring rain i dont mind spending the rest of my life in prison 
i will meet with palestinians and with any arab leader who 
stretches his hand to talk of peace he said this is my way of 
fighting 
also friday israeli soldiers killed an arab youth in the 
occupied west bank town of qabatiya and palestinians observed a 
general strike to mark the beginning of the 27th month of the 
uprising against israeli rule in the occupied lands army and 
hospital reports said 
the army said soldiers shot abed elkader iknin 19 after he 
tried to stab them his death raised to 655 the number of 
palestinians killed by israeli soldiers and civilians since the 
uprising began in december 1987 at least 181 palestinians have 
been killed by their fellow arabs most on suspicion of cooperating 
with israel fortythree israelis have died 
a group of leading leftwing authors and poets published an ad 
in the independent haaretz newspaper friday demanding the repeal of 
the amendment to israels antiterrorism law that makes meeting 
with plo officials a crime punishable by up to three years in jail 
nathan 63 was sentenced under that law to six months in prison 
after pleading guilty to meeting arafat and other palestine 
liberation organization officials in tunis in 1988 he entered eyal 
prison oct 10 and the penalty was reduced by two months for good 
behavior 
as nathan left prison he shook hands with the warden and said 
lehitraot hebrew for til we meet again 
a group of teenagers from a kibbutz or collective farm then 
presented him with a white dove which he symbolically released 
peace activists also handed nathan a bouquet of flowers and an 
olive branch 
i was put in prison because of a law which is an undemocratic 
law which would not be accepted anywhere in the world nathan 
told the associated press i will do everything in my power in 
order to continue my struggle to change the law 
nathans first of seven meetings with arafat was in 1982 when 
he went to lebanon during the israeli siege of beirut in an 
unsuccessful attempt to gain freedom for a captured israeli soldier 
he is best known for making a dramatic trip in a private plane 
to cairo in 1966 to try to persuade egypt to make peace with 
israel in 1978 he went on a 45day hunger strike to protest the 
building of jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip

snipers killed three civilians fleeing an 
embattled district of east beirut on friday as rival christian 
forces battled with machine guns and rocketpropelled grenades 
police said the three a married couple and a friend were 
killed as they tried to escape the lowincome neighborhood of ein 
rummaneh about noon 
earlier in the day police said rescuers took 42 bulletriddled 
corpses from east beirut districts that were the scenes of most of 
the savage fighting 
the command of renegade gen michel aoun also reported the 
deaths of 10 soldiers and two officers in the last two days of 
hostilities 
that brought the overall casualties to 430 killed and 1680 
wounded in the worst intrachristian conflict of the 15year civil 
war pitting aouns soldiers against samir geageas lebanese forces 
militiamen 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the factions blamed each other for provoking the 
intermittent skirmishes across confrontation lines dividing the 
christian enclave in east beirut 
the shooting forced maronite catholic churches to cancel 
services on the occasion of st marouns day the patron saint of 
the sect 
mass was celebrated instead in the studios of the voice of 
lebanon radio station in east beiruts ashrafiyeh neighborhood it 
was said by archbishop khalil abi nader an aide to maronite 
patriarch nasrallah sfeir and was broadcast live 
the french embassy based in east beirut issued a statement 
saying frances minister for humanitarian affairs bernard 
kouchner would try to pursue efforts aimed at stabilizing a 
ceasefire in lebanon 
a french source who refused to be further identified said 
kouchner who had sponsored the evacuation of 16 wounded victims 
from east beirut for treatment in france was not optimistic 
about the future of the ceasefire 
the police spokesman also said the combatants do not seem to 
be preparing to withdraw 
the tanks are still in combat formation fighters are still in 
firing positions these are not indications that a truce is in the 
making he said 
papal nuncio pablo puente who had launched repeated efforts to 
halt the bloodshed left beirut to undergo an operation that he had 
postponed for a long time a statement said it did not elaborate 
a security committee grouping representatives of geagea and aoun 
held a twohour meeting in bkirki north of beirut 
a statement afterward said both sides assured puente who 
attended the meeting that they would strictly adhere to a 
ceasefire they also agreed on reopening the christian enclaves 
three main highways 
more than a halfdozen previous ceasefires have collapsed 
this is your last chance his holiness pope john paul ii 
insists there will not be a second chance you have to resolve your 
difference on a basis of coordination in military affairs and 
plurality in political affairs the statement quoted puente as 
telling committee members 
the clashes in the christian enclave have forced hundreds of 
civilians to flee to safety in moslem west beirut and other areas 
outside the enclave 
the fighting between rival christian forces for control of the 
christian heartland is the latest in the 15year cycle of sectarian 
bloodshed 
aoun has refused to recognize a syrianbacked christianmoslem 
government and has battled to drive out syrian troops siding with 
moslem militias in west beirut 
rival shiite moslem factions also have battled intermittently 
for control of beiruts southern slums

cuba accused the united states on friday 
of playing modernday buccaneer by attacking a cubanchartered 
freighter but the us ambassador said the coast guard acted 
properly 
ambassador alexander watson told the security council the us 
actions were fully consistent with international maritime law and 
practice the action taken by the cuban government was not 
the freighter hermann registered in panama was hit at least 
twice by fire from a us coast guard cutter jan 31 when the crew 
refused to allow a search and us authorities suspected the vessel 
was involved in drug smuggling the freighter then sailed into 
mexican waters and the us cutter chincoteague ended its pursuit 
ambassador ricardo alarcon de quesada of cuba accused the united 
states of endangering security in the region and violating 
international law by interfering with the freighter in 
international waters 
he said cuba is not ready to grant the united states the right 
of practicing piracy nor will cubans allow themselves to be 
intimidated by imperial arrogance 
what difference is there between this repressive action and 
actions undertaken by buccaneers of the old pirate days alarcon 
asked 
he said the hermann had no connection with drug trafficking and 
urged the 15member security council to put an end to us actions 
he described as threatening international peace and security 
cuba requested the meeting of the council which adjourned 
without action cuba is council president for february and passed 
the gavel temporarily to south yemen 
watson the deputy us permanent representative said the 
united states had obtained permission from panama to search the 
hermann if necessary 
he said cuba inexplicably ordered the civilian crew of the 
hermann to resist the lawful efforts of the coast guard to inspect 
the vessel as part of a routine law enforcement operation 
that showed blatant disregard for international efforts to 
stop the illegal drug trade the ambassador said 
since cuba had allowed previous searches in similar 
circumstances watson said the incident proved president fidel 
castros government wanted to provoke a confrontation 
the incident is not a spat between the us and cuba although 
the cuban government for reasons that are opaque tries to make it 
one he said the only states involved are the united states 
and panama the government of cuba acted as if it had the right 
to frustrate a lawful inspection duly authorized by the flag state 
that is a prescription for chaos at sea 
watson said the hermanns captain refused to identify the crew 
by nationality and caused suspicion because his answers to 
authorities on the cutter were unusually brief and evasive he said 
previous searches of vessels on the same route had yielded illegal 
narcotics 
although the hermann crew told the coast guard the vessel had no 
cargo aboard the freighter was low in the water creating further 
suspicions of illegal activity the us ambassador told the 
council 
he said the cutter tried to disable the hermann by firing shots 
into its stern when other attempts to stop it failed 
before firing at the freighter watson said the cutters crew 
displayed blue law enforcement lights sprayed water across the 
hermanns decks and down its stack and fired warning shots across 
its bow

the bush administration asked congress on 
friday to remove import duties on clothing shoes and other 
laborintensive products from the caribbean and central america but 
said it opposes any tampering with sugar quotas imposed on the 
region 
endorsing an extension and expansion of president reagans 1983 
caribbean basin initiative us trade represenative carla hills 
said lifting the present duties would mitigate the need for 
foreign aid and raise our own exports to the region 
however she said changing import quota formulas on sugar to 
assure the caribbean a stable us market to the possible detriment 
of other exporters such as australia and the phillippines would 
violate international trade agreements 
when asked at a senate hearing if she would recommend that 
president bush veto a bill that includes a guaranteed minimum for 
sugar imports from the caribbean mrs hills said she didnt know 
congress is expected this year to make permanent the current 
program now scheduled to expire in september 1995 but expanding 
it to include dutyfree status on a wide variety of goods that 
compete with us products is encountering widespread opposition 
supporters should keep in mind the adverse consequences 
said sen max baucus dmont chairman of the senate finance 
committees subcommittee on international trade 
lawmakers baucus said at fridays hearing by his panel have 
close ties with the caribbean but they have even closer ties with 
their own constituents 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and sen john 
danforth rmo for example strongly oppose removing the present 
duties on shoes and leather products their states are major 
producers of both 
the house last year approved a bill by rep sam gibbons dfla 
to make the initiative permanent but struck provisions that would 
have extended the dutyfree status for several products 
however the bill would cut duties in half for a wide variety of 
products including nonleather footwear handbags luggage and 
work gloves 
it and a companion bill by sen bob graham dfla would 
increase the dutyfree allowance for tourists returning from the 
caribbean from 400 to 600 
congressional sources said the senate version could be ready for 
a floor vote by late march

an assembly of 72 members who were on 
opposite sides of a 23year war unanimously adopted a democratic 
constitution friday in the last major step to independence from 
south africa 
it guarantees fundamental individual rights and limits a 
president to two fiveyear terms a rarity on a continent where 
leaders often serve for life the constitution will take effect 
with independence march 21 
a spirit of compromise and reconciliation was evident during the 
80day drafting process although the members constituents ranged 
from black marxists to rightwing whites 
this is indeed a historic day said hage geingob chairman 
of the constituent assembly and an official of the southwest 
africa peoples organization 
swapo guerrillas ended a 23year bush war against south african 
rule last year and in november the movement won 41 of the assembly 
seats to assure itself control of the new government 
delegates adopted the constitution in a ceremony on the front 
steps of the tintenpalast the legislative building on a hilltop in 
windhoek capital of the vast sparsely populated territory south 
africa captured from germany in world war i 
former guerrillas and the territorial police once enemies 
stood beside one another to watch the events 
today the masses of our people have a constitution which 
embodies their aspirations to be masters of their own destiny 
said sam nujoma leader of swapo the assembly is expected to elect

president bush told state lawmakers friday not 
to expect quick fixes from washington but promised federal help to 
promote new approaches to solving old problems 
speaking to a group of state legislators at the white house the 
president promised to help cut burdensome red tape that restricts 
the flow of federal funds to the states 
my formula for federalism comes down to more flexibility 
and fewer mandates bush said 
his remarks came a day after a report by the national conference 
of state legislatures said that half of the states are facing 
deficits or unexpectedly low revenues 
bush said his fiscal 1991 budget proposal calls for increased 
spending on the environment and education and for combatting drugs 
and crime 
that might help financially strapped states deal with these 
problems bush suggested more federal money should not in my 
view automatically mean more federal management he said 
but he added we dont need a quick fix we need quick 
action 
using the states as laboratories theme he has sounded 
before bush said he was prepared to support more demonstration 
projects both fostering and financing experimentation in the 
states 
from criminal justice to education from child care to the 
environment state and local governments are looking for new 
approaches to solving old problems he said 
the president also voiced a broad philosophical commitment to 
federalism 
federalism is the word the reagan administration used for a 
variety of proposals to transfer programs and the associated 
costs from the federal government to states 
bush told the lawmakers he was committed to the return of 
american political power to the states thats where it began 
thats where it belongs

president fw de klerk accused 
his rightwing opponents friday of stirring up blackwhite 
animosity that could plunge south africa into a race war 
in johannesburg police beat blacks with batons and chased 
hundreds through downtown streets to break up a peaceful 
antiapartheid demonstration in which they marked their first week 
of new freedoms 
and 22 senior antiapartheid leaders met with nelson mandela but 
said the jailed african national congress leader had no information 
on his release which is widely expected this month 
de klerk responding to his critics in the proapartheid 
conservative party said his national party talks renewal and 
courage and they talk racism and aggression 
on feb 2 in a speech that launched a new era in south africa 
de klerk lifted restrictions on more than 60 opposition groups 
including mandelas anc guerrilla movement and pledged to free 
mandela soon 
the conservatives who won 31 percent of the white vote in 
elections last year say de klerk has capitulated to the 28 million 
black majority they also have threatened to stage boycotts and 
protest strikes 
they the conservatives will plunge this country into a 
racial war de klerk told parliament but he added the 
government and i will not allow anyone or any party to set fire to 
this country 
de klerk said his own party which has ruled south africa since 
1948 will still be here 10 to 20 years from now looking after 
the interests of its people and cooperating with the leaders of 
other people 
de klerk says he wants to bring south africas disenfranchised 
blacks into the national government within five years but he 
opposes a oneman onevote system the basic demand of all leading 
antiapartheid groups 
at the victor verster prison outside cape town the 22 
antiapartheid leaders met with mandela in what they hoped was the 
last such political strategy session before he is freed 
his feeling was at the end of the meeting how he wished 
he could come home with us said murphy morobe one of the 
activists 
the delegation the largest yet to see mandela at his house on 
the prison farm included most members of the executive committee 
of the united democratic front a nationwide antiapartheid 
coalition 
the fronts delegation gave mandela a policy document that said 
negotiations with the government could start only after democratic 
nonracial elections to form an assembly that would draft a new 
constitution de klerk has rejected this demand 
there are daily rumors that mandela is about to be freed 
however according to sources mandela is expecting visitors 
through monday including the rev jesse jackson neither the 
government nor jackson has confirmed the meeting date the american 
civil rights leader is on a 12day tour of south africa 
mandela 71 is the countrys bestknown black leader and has 
offered to serve as mediator in talks between the government and 
the anc he has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping to launch the ancs guerrilla campaign 
in johannesburg more than 1000 demonstrators rallied in st 
marys anglican church to mark last weeks unbanning of the anc 
after the twohour service activists spilled out into a 
pedestrian mall and began dancing and singing freedom songs a 
policeman ordered them to disperse but within seconds his fellow 
officers converged from both sides and began hitting the activists 
with clubs 
police chased demonstrators through busy streets toppling the 
stalls of vendors and forcing cars to come to screeching halts 
in several instances police surrounded unarmed demonstrators 
and hit them five or more times with their batons some activists 
later hurled bottles and rocks at the police police arrested 
several people and several more were hurt 
de klerk has said his government will permit peaceful protest if 
advance permission is sought from authorities on several recent 
occasions police have dispersed peaceful crowds calling the 
demonstrations illegal 
in another development two whites who had been jailed for their 
involvement with the african national congress were released friday 
barbara hogan and rob adams both sentenced to 10 years in 1982 
for treason were freed in johannesburg 
dozens of activists jailed for belonging to the anc and other 
previously banned organizations are expected to be released now 
that the groups are legal 
the unbanning was a triumph for the movement and we both feel 
vindicated for our involvement ms hogan said

fundamentalist hindus decided friday to 
postpone building a temple at a disputed religious site claimed by 
both moslems and hindus 
avaidyanath a hindu priest who uses one name told reporters 
the world hindu conference decided to postpone construction of the 
temple for at least four months so the government can find a 
solution to the longrunning dispute 
construction was to have started feb 14 on land that also 
contains a 16th century mosque 
prime minister vp singh said building the shrine would inflame 
religious passions and lead to widespread violence and he urged 
hindus to call off construction 
we have decided to accept the prime ministers appeal said 
avaidyanath who wore the saffron robes of a hindu ascetic well 
give him four months to solve the issue 
last year at least 300 people died in violence sparked by the 
hindu groups decision to build the temple and raze the mosque the 
foundation stone for the shrine was laid nov 9 but construction 
was postponed because of the dispute 
hindus claim the site is the birthplace of the rama an 
incarnation of vishnu one of the most important hindu gods they 
say the babri masjid or the mosque named after moghal emperor 
babar was built over ramas birthplace 
moslems say it is difficult to say where rama was born and they 
will not accept destruction of their mosque 
the issue has become a flashpoint for tensions between indias 
majority hindus who make up 82 percent of its 880 million people 
and its moslems who form the countrys largest minority but still 
comprise only 12 percent of the population 
the dispute became a major issue in last novembers general 
elections and analysts say it was one of the causes of the 
downfall of the previous prime minister rajiv gandhi 
singh his successor has not come up with any specfic plan to 
solve the problem but has promised to set up a government committee 
to meet hindu and moslem representatves and try to come up with a 
solution 
the problem has been hanging for 450 years said ashok 
singhal general secretary of the world hindu conference four 
months more will not matter

czechoslovakia renewed ties with 
israel on friday in the latest move by an east bloc nation to scrap 
a sovietordered policy of the past 
foreign minister moshe arens of israel called the restoration of 
diplomatic ties a first step toward very good and very friendly 
relations 
foreign minister jiri dienstbier of czechoslovakia and arens 
both said they hoped the resumption of ties would lead to trade and 
increased cooperation between israel and czechoslovakia which was 
one of israels strongest supporters when it was founded in 1948 
arens paid tribute to pragues supplies of weapons and training 
of air force pilots during that period noting that 
czechoslovakia was one of the few nations that lent important 
assistance to israel in its hour of need during the war of 
independence in 1948 
czechoslovakia and other east bloc nations followed moscows 
mandate and broke ties with israel because of the 1967 middle east 
war romania maintained ties at the time and east germany never had 
established relations 
since the revolts that toppled old communist regimes in eastern 
europe soviet bloc nations have been moving toward a more western 
orientation in their foreign policies 
czechoslovakia became the second soviet bloc nation to 
reestablish ties with israel after hungary 
on friday hungary became the second nation to restore relations 
with the vatican following poland last year 
arens told czechoslovak television late friday he expected 
relations with poland to be resumed by the end of this month and 
with all other east european nations and the soviet union within 
months 
east germany has never had relations with israel because of east 
berlins consistent refusal in the past to acknowledge any guilt 
for the nazi holocaust that killed 6 million jews or to pay 
compensation to victims 
now however east german premier hans modrow has acknowledged 
east germanys part in the nazi past 
arens declined to react to modrows statement saying only that 
it would be very carefully examined initial contacts between 
the israeli and east german foreign ministries on establishing ties 
had identified the admission of guilt as a key issue he noted 
dienstbier signaled the clean break that he and president vaclav 
havel are trying to make with the communist past 
im very happy that we could meet and remedy that nonsense of 
cutting off relations with israel dienstbier told arens the 
israeli in turn said his nation is watching czechoslovakias 
transition to democracy with great sympathy and admiration 
czechoslovakia has long maintained ties with the palestine 
liberation organization elevating those to full diplomatic 
relations in 1988 
havel has offered to mediate in the middle east if required 
havel and arens discussed that offer friday afternoon with the 
israeli thanking czechoslovakia for its concern for peace the 
state news agency ctk said 
it said havel was invited to visit israel but made no mention 
of whether his offer to mediate would be taken up 
before signing fridays agreement arens toured pragues ancient 
jewish quarter and visited the former site of a nazi concentration 
camp at theresienstadt 
before world war ii there were 240000 jews in czechoslovakia 
prague was for centuries one of the leading centers of jewish 
education and culture 
today there are only about 6000 jews in czechoslovakia most 
of them in the capital

lincoln savings and loan association was 
manufacturing profits by giving its money away an accountant who 
examined lincolns books at the governments request testified 
friday 
roger johnson said in us district court that the collapsed 
thrift owned by phoenix financier charles h keating and seized by 
federal regulators last april recorded 135 million in pretax 
gains on 15 land transactions in 1986 and 1987 
in reality however there was a net outflow of cash from 
lincoln in each instance said johnson a certified public 
accountant for kenneth leventhal amp co 
the net cash expended by lincoln to accomplish the sales totaled 
217 million according to a draft of a report prepared last july 
by johnsons firm and introduced in court 
reading from the report johnson said the irvine calif thrift 
was made to function as an engine designed to funnel insured 
deposits to keatings phoenix holding company the american 
continental corp 
the cash outflow is precisely the opposite of what you would 
expect the profits reported should have been reversed 
johnson told us district court judge stanley sporkin 
lincoln is suing the governments office of thrift supervision 
seeking a court order to remove the conservatorship and 
receivership regulators imposed last year to seize control of the 
thrift 
american continental corp benefited from the 15 transactions 
under a taxsharing agreement in which lincoln made payments to its 
parent 
seldom in our experience as accountants have we encountered a 
more egregious example of the misapplication of generally accepted 
accounting principles testified johnson reading from the report 
lincoln created profits by making loans many of the loans 
were bad said johnson lincoln was manufacturing profits by 
giving its money away 
in two hours of testimony johnson described a series of deals 
in which lincoln sold land to buyers who didnt have enough cash to 
make the down payment ten of the 15 transactions involved an area 
in arizona known as hidden valley 8500 acres which johnson 
testified likely wont be developed during the remainder of this 
century 
in one transaction lincoln received a 35 million cash down 
payment for the sale of 1000 acres to westcontinental mortgage 
investment corp a firm with only 87000 in assets 
westcontinental got the down payment the day before the sale 
from a company operated by businessman ec garcia garcias 
company in turn had received 196 million from lincoln the same 
day garcia lent the 35 million to westcontinental 
calling westcontinental a straw buyer johnson said garcia 
placed the property involved in the sale on his books in june 1988 
johnson said we find no evidence that westcontinental or garcia 
has paid any principal or interest on a 105 million note held by 
lincoln for the remainder of the deal lincoln reported an 111 
million profit in the transaction 
garcia who had no loans outstanding with lincoln at the 
beginning of 1987 had 128 million outstanding by the end of that 
year said johnson

president mikhail s gorbachev on friday refused 
to say whether he would run in a campaign to keep his job a 
onceunthinkable scenario made possible by his partys historic 
acceptance of a multiparty system and direct elections 
lets wait and see he said in a relaxed encounter with 
reporters gorbachev is riding high on success after persuading the 
communist party central committee wednesday to adopt a new platform 
favoring reforms 
besides opening the way for competition with new parties and 
abolishing the partys constitutionally guaranteed leading role 
the platform favors a stronger presidency to be filled in a 
contested election 
gorbachev has never faced a popular election during his five 
years in power the soviet parliament named him to a fiveyear term 
last summer and there has been speculation that he will be allowed 
to serve a second term without having to submit to voters 
there also has been speculation that gorbachev eventually will 
step down as leader of his splintering party and concentrate on his 
duties in a strengthened presidency 
gorbachev told reporters that the party platform contains only 
the current stage of his longplanned reforms 
once we have solidified this phase we will move on he said 
the changes pushed through the central committee had been in the 
works since he took power five years ago gorbachev said 
it certainly would be wrong for the west and everyone to 
believe we began these changes only in the last few days he 
said they have been under way since 1985 
gorbachev made his comments before meeting with us secretary 
of state james a baker iii who is in moscow in hopes of forging 
an arms agreement to be signed at the june summit 
one of gorbachevs assistants meanwhile offered the first 
highlevel warning that the communist party must reform or lose 
power to the opponents it has agreed to legalize 
a choice stands before the party in the conditions of 
political pluralism restructure itself and struggle to show in 
competition its right to be the ruling party or slide into 
opposition and maybe even leave the political arena economist 
nikolai petrakov said in an interview with the official tass news 
agency 
petrakov also said the partys platform accepts private 
ownership of factories which would amount to a second dramatic 
reversal of longstanding soviet policy 
the economic section is based on many forms of ownership of 
the means of production and other things including cooperative and 
individual property he said in marxist jargon means of 
production are factories and equipment 
other soviet officials have said the platform bans property that 
involves exploitation of the working man defined as the 
appropriation of some of the value created by a laborer 
the contradiction implies that the kremlin leadership plans to 
redefine marxist terms to fit the new policy 
activists have criticized the new communist platform as 
inadequate because the party will continue to exert control through 
party units in factories army units the police courts and most 
public organizations 
but on friday an official soviet trade union cut its ties with 
the party and government tass reported friday 
tass said the action by the fishing industry union was a first 
for the soviet union official unions have been used for decades to 
keep workers under control and prevent strikes the fishing union 
also took control of its own budget and set up a strike fund tass 
said

a collection of 14 ancient silver dishes worth 
an estimated 70 million that will rewrite the history of roman 
art will be sold unless its authenticity or ownership is 
challenged sothebys said friday 
the sevso treasure has four large plates five pitchers a tall 
jar two buckets a basin a ladys toilet casket and the 
copperalloy cauldron in which the silver was believed to have been 
found in lebanon in the mid1970s 
the pieces decorated with mythological and contemporary figures 
of the fourth and fifth centuries in total outweigh the combined 
weight of the 98 pieces of the two other main silver treasures of 
the period the auction house said 
every time i look at it i get goose pimples said marcus 
linell senior director of sothebys of europe it is a startling 
find in every respect 
it is so good and so grand and of such good quality that it 
will make a reappraisal of the art of the period necessary he 
said 
this is an incredible moment said michael l ainslie 
president of sothebys holdings inc this is the most important 
collection of roman silver known to exist this will rewrite the 
history of roman art 
he said sothebys was estimating its worth at 70 million but 
added that the treasure was too unusual to easily put a price tag 
on 
but one reason sothebys is displaying the collection is to 
spread the word in case anyone wants to challenge its ownership or 
authenticity if not it is expected to be offered in the fall in 
zurich switzerland by sothebys which also plans to entertain 
private offers 
sothebys says it has confirmed the collections authenticity 
through extensive laboratory testing as well as scholarly and 
scientific research 
it also had the owners export licenses examined and ratified by 
the lebanese embassy in switzerland and sent descriptions and 
photographs of each piece to cultural attaches in switzerland for 
each of the 29 countries which were in or part of the roman empire 
in the fourth century 
to increase scrutiny of the collection sothebys announced it 
would publicly display it from saturday to feb 20 while 5000 
scholars and academics gather for the college art association 
conference 
the collection was acquired piecemeal during the 1980s from its 
owner in lebanon by the marquess of northampton settlement a 
family trust in guernsey england linell refused to disclose how 
much the estate paid for the silver 
the collection was named after a hunting plate which carried the 
name of its owner sevso 
linell said it was likely that the person who discovered the 
treasure sought anonymity so others would not know about the money 
paid for the silver

month ago but production is still down sharply from last season 
because of widespread freeze damage in late december the 
agriculture department said friday 
the new estimate of 169 million boxes was based on feb 1 
indications and is up 7 percent from the january forecast of fewer 
than 158 million boxes 
even so the freezedamaged crops is expected to be down 19 
percent from 209 million boxes in 198889 most of the reduction 
was attributed to a 32 percent decline in the florida crop 
the severe freeze in floridas citrus belt on dec 2425 
further reduced an already short orange crop the report said 
the increase in total output from last month reflects 
betterthanexpected salvage operation in florida and increased 
expectations in california

down from 1466 million last season but up from 92 million forecast 
last month 
the texas crop was forecast at 12 million boxes down from 185 
million in 198889 and 125 million forecast in january california

last season and 63 million indicated last month 
arizona production was expected to be 17 million boxes 
unchanged from january and the same as last season 
total grapefruit production was forecast at 416 million boxes 
down 9 percent from the january forecast and 36 percent below last 
year reflecting the freeze in florida and texas 
higherthanexpected fruit droppage in florida due to the 
freeze is a main reason for this continued decline the report 
said 
florida grapefruit production was estimated at 34 million boxes

advocates for the homeless are blasting a 
proposal under consideration by mayor maynard jackson to require 
people who want to beg for money to buy a license first 
the licenses are part of a proposed program that would also 
include counseling and jobplacement programs paid for by local 
businesses details including the license fee havent been worked 
out 
were going to present the strongest law possible because it 
begging has gotten out of hand jackson said this week adding 
that he plans to offer his panhandling plan within a month 
as many as 10000 homeless people live in atlanta said anita 
beaty codirector of the task force for the homeless 
ed loring director of the open door community an atlanta 
shelter called the license proposal awful 
a person with enough money to get a license is not a 
panhandler he said 
but the licensing plan is supported by some downtown business 
leaders 
business leaders are concerned about street crime about 
panhandling that goes far beyond begging and about the conduct of 
some people who are being abusive said joe martin president of 
central atlanta progress 
at the same time we feel its important to take a positive 
approach to the needs of the homeless including providing 
opportunities for temporary and permanent jobs and forging a 
comprehensive strategy to deal with the causes of the problem he 
said 
atlanta already has a law that makes panhandling illegal but it 
is rarely enforced a federal judge in new york recently said a 
rule banning panhandlers from that citys subway system and bus and 
rail stations could not be enforced he said begging is protected 
free speech 
after his ruling the new york agency that runs the bus and rail 
stations began issuing permits to beggars as it does to anyone who 
wants to solicit 
but an appeals court has put the new york ruling on hold and 
panhandling is again illegal 
jackson said he personally sympathizes with beggars 
ninety percent of the people who panhandle have no money and 
are desperate and they beg he said my policy is when someone 
asks for money i give it

us secretary of state james a baker 
iii will make a stopover saturday in bulgaria en route from moscow 
to romania the state bta news agency reported 
the oneparagraph dispatch friday offered no details beyond 
saying baker would arrive in the afternoon it will be the first 
visit to bulgaria by a us secretary of state 
bakers visit to romania was announced earlier friday he is the 
highestranked american government official to come to bucharest 
since the december revolution that toppled dictator nicolae 
ceausescu and ended two decades of communist party rule 
todor zhivkov bulgarias hardline communist ruler was ousted 
in november and his more reformminded communist successors have 
promised free elections and other reforms 
bakers brief visits to the two countries appear meant to signal 
american interest in the process of democratization in romanias 
case the visit also seems calculated to defuse criticism by 
romanian officials that washingtons reluctance to send a ranking 
official signals disinterest in the reforms 
us officials have been cautious about the chances of true 
democracy in the two countries while both plan elections in may 
the officials have pointed to the continued communist grip on power 
in bulgaria and to the prolonged reluctance of romanias 
selfinstalled interim government to share the running of the 
country pending the planned elections

classified military mission 
the working target has been feb 22 but officials want to 
assess the readiness of all launch elements before setting a firm 
date saturday 
nasa said a delay in replacing a faulty engine turbopump could 
cause a oneday slip but the agency said it was hoping the time 
could be made up a new pump was installed friday and leak checks 
will be conducted saturday 
if the feb 22 date holds atlantis is scheduled to blast off at 
114 am with a crew of five astronauts 
for security reasons neither the pentagon nor nasa will 
identify the satellite but sources close to the project report it 
is a highly sophisticated reconnaissance satellite that will gather

arguments on both sides of the monosodium 
glutamate issue spiced up a hearing on a proposal to make 
restaurants disclose their use of it 
leading the charge against msg a flavor enhancer was san 
francisco supervisor wendy nelder whose proposal has angered 
restaurateurs at the hearing thursday nelder accused her critics 
of not caring whether diners live or die 
it is really no skin off anyones nose to make restaurateurs 
let people know what they are eating said nelder 
but restaurateurs disagreed 
ive had more people with problems with mayonnaise said 
colleen meharry of miz browns restaurant i have people who come 
in and say they are allergic to mayonnaise but i dont post that 
mayonnaise is dangerous to them 
supervisor angela alioto chimed in dont give her any ideas 
nelder said friday that her proposal would require restaurateurs 
to put a small mark on their menus next to dishes that are made 
with msg 
among those who testified on behalf of nelders proposal was 
jack samuels an investment banker from chicago who told the 
committee if i dont stay away from this stuff im going to 
die 
samuel said he came to testify because san francisco is a very 
important trendsetting city 
apparently the atlantabased glutamate association agreed 
because the trade organization comprised of msg manufacturers 
has sent its executive director to san francisco four times in the 
past month to fight the proposal 
the food and drug administration despite anecdotal evidence 
has categorized msg as a safe ingredient 
by the time the meeting ended nelder had stormed out angry 
because she didnt have enough votes to support the measure until 
the citys health and small business commissions issue their 
opinions the committee will take up the issue again next month

the soviet union is expected to trim total 
grain imports to about 38 million metric tons this year up 1 
million tons from estimates last month the agriculture department 
said friday 
but that would be down from 39 million tons of grain imported by 
the soviets in 198889 the imports are for the trade year that 
runs from july 1 through the next june 
the departments foreign agricultural service said moscow 
reported in late january a 1989 total grain harvest of 2111 
million tons the departments earlier forecast of the soviet 
harvest was 208 million tons 
a metric ton is approximately 2205 pounds about 367 bushels 
of wheat or 394 bushels of corn 
moscows harvest figures would make the 1989 harvest one of the 
largest on record up from 1951 million tons in 1988 but 
fractionally below the 1987 harvest of 2114 million tons 
according to the report the record was 2374 million tons in 1978

foods as diverse as chocolate sea 
slugs and calf brains have been touted as aphrodisiacs throughout 
history says the coauthor of a book on the subject 
almost everything you can think of has been used as an 
aphrodisiac including tree bark sharks fin and hippopotamus 
snout said george armelagos coauthor of consuming passions 
often foods perceived to enhance sexual desire simply may add to 
physical or mental wellbeing because they are good sources of 
protein such as eggs caviar and oysters he said 
the prune was thought to be such a strong aphrodisiac that the 
brothels in elizabethan england would serve them to their 
customers said armelagos chairman of the university of 
floridas anthropology department 
when irelands population boomed the english assumed the potato 
was an aphrodisiac he said 
many seafoods are considered erotic eating partly because the 
ancient goddesses of love aphrodite or venus were said to have 
emerged from sea foam one 17thcentury french physician reported 
that his people felt most amorous during lent when they ate a lot 
of fish 
chocolate a popular valentine days gift has a substance 
called phenylethelalanine that accumulates in the pleasure centers 
of the brain mimicking what happens during sexual activity he 
said 
alcohol especially champagne is commonly thought to be an 
aphrodisiac reflecting poet ogden nashs sentiment that candys 
dandy but liquors quicker armelagos said 
although champagne is a noted ingredient in seduction scenes 
whatever effectiveness it may have is probably due to the flattery 
of being offered an expensive commodity he said 
still no food has ever been proven to be an aphrodisiac 
the brain is the most important sexual organ he said if 
you think saltines will work then youve got a good cheap

in what will be the second exit of a network 
morning anchorwoman in a years time kathleen sullivan is being 
replaced on cbs this morning her agent said friday 
cbs said it cant confirm or deny that 
sullivan whose cbs contract expires in november got the word 
wednesday in a meeting with cbs news president david burke and 
other executives said her agent ron konecky no date is set for 
her departure he said 
not really he said when asked if they gave any reason why 
they wanted to replace her on the twohour morning show that she 
has coanchored with harry smith since its premiere nov 30 1987 
i think that was a management decision they felt they had to 
make konecky said im having ongoing positive meetings with 
them with a view to other assignments for kathleen at cbs 
there have been reports she will be succeeded by paula zahn 
coanchor of abcs world news this morning and the news 
segments of the following good morning america 
scott richardson an abc spokesman said he had no comment on 
whether zahn will leave abc cbs spokeswoman terry everett said cbs 
cant confirm or deny if sullivan 36 is out at cbs this 
morning 
asked if sullivans coanchor smith is staying at the cbs 
show a cbs official who spoke on condition he not be identified by 
name said yes 
from its start the program has been a distant third in ratings 
to good morning america and nbcs today speaking last 
october on the syndicated donahue show last fall sullivan 
predicted my days are numbered if the ratings didnt improve 
ironically another anchorwoman appearing with her on 
donahue was jane pauley who as part of the most controverial 
change in today left that show in december after 13 years as 
its cohost she was succeeded in january by deborah norville 
sullivan coanchored fridays cbs this morning from atlanta 
during the broadcast she made no mention of her impending 
depature neither did smith or news anchor charles osgood she 
couldnt be reached for comment friday 
everett who said the program will originate from florida next 
week said sullivan had gone to atlanta on personal business 
ted turners cable news network is based in atlanta but konecky 
said she wasnt there for talks with cnn officials nor was he 
negotiating with them for her 
he said cbs officials have asked her to stay on at cbs this 
morning during its transition to a new anchorwoman and shes 
happy to do so 
the news of sullivans impending exit coupled with the 
threemonth payless suspension of 60 minutes humorist andy 
rooney for a racial slur attributed to him came at an awkward time 
for cbs executives 
a spokesman said that burke cbs this morning executive

a crack in the steel barrier encasing the 
damaged three mile island nuclear reactor apparently is deeper than 
initially thought officials said friday raising new questions 
about the severity of the 1979 accident at the plant 
gpu nuclear corp said in a statement that the discovery was 
made thursday when scientists examined pictures of a metal sample 
taken from the 5inch thick bottom shield in the unit 2 reactor 
the discovery is an indication that the consequences of the 
accident could have easily been much worse robert pollard a 
nuclear safety engineer for the union of concerned scientists said 
pollard said he was surprised that the nuclear reactor remained 
intact adding apparently it did so by a small margin 
company spokeswoman mary wells said what appeared to be surface 
cracks in a steel lining shield were discovered last summer new 
pictures show the crack apparently extended through the lining and 
into the bottom steel wall of the reactor 
the companys statement said the crack appears to extend most of 
the way through the 3inch thick sample cut from the reactor bottom 
ms wells said the steel wall that contains the apparent crack 
is the final steel wall before we get to concrete a 13feet 
thick concrete wall separates the shield and the reactor from the 
ground 
ms wells said it is too soon to tell if the discovery means the 
accident was more serious 
this is a sample and it has to be analyzed she said when 
all the scientists have analyzed them they will draw the 
conclusion as to what it means 
she said however that there is no indication that radioactive 
material escaped from the reactor vessel 
the nuclear regulatory commission was notified of the 
development but spokesman frank ingram agreed it was too soon to 
draw conclusions 
eric epstein of the antinuclear group three mile island alert 
said the finding clearly indicates that we do not know the full 
extent of the damage to the reactor we question whether the plant 
is in a stable condition 
the 1979 accident was caused by a combination of human and 
mechanical errors which resulted in protective cooling water being 
drained from the reactor it is considered the worst commercial 
nuclear accident in the united states

a us diplomat said friday that 
colombia and the united states had never cooperated more closely in 
the antidrug war but a colombian economist suggested the economy 
here could collapse if that war succeeds 
the statements came days before president bush is to join 
presidents virgilio barco of colombia alan garcia of peru and 
jaime paz zamora of bolivia in cartagena colombia to discuss ways 
of better cooperating in the fight 
bolivia and peru together produce most of the coca leaf used to 
make the worlds cocaine colombia is the processing center before 
the drug is smuggled abroad and the united states is the worlds 
largest consumer of cocaine 
to me the real story leading up to the drug summit is the way 
people in the united states and latin american drugproducing 
countries are beginning to talk about the problem in the same 
serious way the us official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told reporters at a briefing at the us embassy 
he said he expected the feb 15 summit to produce the kind of 
agreement in which each country that is part of the problem becomes 
part of the solution 
since august colombia has intensified a crackdown on 
traffickers that drew praise from us officials 
but the crackdown focusing on capturing traffickers responsible 
for a terrorist campaign here has failed to significantly reduce 
the supply of cocaine reaching the united states us officials 
say 
colombian officials economists and news commentators complain 
in turn that colombia is spilling its blood to protect us 
interests while the bush administration fails to compensate it 
economically for the effort 
bogota economist salamon kalmanowitz says in an interview 
published in el espectador newspaper colombia should demand from 
the united states adequate compensation for the losses both human 
and material that the war against drug trafficking has produced 
kalmanowitz a professor at the bogotas national university 
said drug traffickers invested 65 billion in colombia over the 
last 10 years and predicted an economic collapse if the drug fight 
continues without what he calls adequate compensation 
he said colombian drug traffickers also invested 35 billion in 
other countries including the united states the past decade 
if we add up the value of all of colombias equity inside the 
country and abroad we see that 35 percent of the national wealth 
accumulated over 100 years of modern history is in the hands of a 
bourgeois class of gansters kalmanowitz said 
kalmanowitz has spent years analyzing the possible economic 
impact here of an end to the drug trade but did not spell out in 
the interview how he arrived at his figures 
us drug enforcement administration officials here have 
questioned how kalmanowitz and other economists obtain their 
information on the the shadowy drug trade but have rarely disputed 
the results of the studies 
the bogota economic magazine coyuntura economica calculated last 
december that drug traffickers foreign exchange profits accounted 
for 38 percent of colombias annual gross national product 
estimated at 40 billion 
it said the drug trade accounted for 3 percent of national 
employment 
the united states gave colombia 20 million in economic aid and 
80 million in military assistance in 1989 the us official said 
he said military aid will rise to 95 million in 1990 and that 
the amount of economic aid will be announced at the summit 
colombian officials have indicated that the amount of aid 
planned for colombia this year by the bush administration falls 
short ambassador victor mosquera chaux told a congressional 
committee in washington last month that colombia will need 1 
billion a year in economic and military assistance 
foreign minister julio londono said in a recent interview in el 
espectador that more economic cooperation was needed between the 
two countries if the drug war was to succeed 
colombia asked the united states to help it renegotiate an 
international coffee pact broken last year resulting in a steep 
drop in coffee prices 
coffee is colombias top official export the price drop has 
already cost colombia 187 million and barco says it stands to lose 
up to 400 million a year

federal setasides for minority businesses 
should be given the same strict scrutiny that the supreme court 
applies to state and local programs the justice department said 
friday 
any such racial classificiation must be narrowly tailored to 
achieve the compelling governmental interest identified by 
congress the justice department said in a filing with the 
supreme court 
the justice department made its statement in a 
friendofthecourt brief filed in a case challenging the federal 
communications commissions policy of giving preference to minority 
businesses seeking broadcast licenses 
the high court is considering a challenge to the fcc policy of 
giving extra weight to applications for broadcast licenses by 
businesses owned by blacks women hispanics or other minorities 
the justice department said the same standard under which the 
high court last year threw out a minority setaside program for 
construction contracts in richmond va should be applied to the 
fcc case 
in our view racial classifications adopted by the federal 
government must also withstand the strict scrutiny applied to 
those adopted by state and local governments the justice 
department said 
thus federal minority preference programs no less than state 
and local programs must serve a compelling government interest and 
by narrowly tailored to achieve that interest the department 
said 
the justice department said the high court owed greater 
deference to a finding by congress that there is compelling 
need for remedial action than a similar conclusion by a state or 
local government 
nevertheless there remain important limitations on congress 
power to adopt racial preferences 
but this additional measure of deference is appropriate only 
if congress itself makes the critical determination that such a 
program is required and only if this determination has an adequate 
basis in fact the department said 
and any such racial classification must be narrowly tailored 
to achieve a compelling governmental interest identified by 
congress 
when the supreme court upheld a federal minorityset aside 
program for construction contracts in 1980 it found that 
congress had abundance evidence that discriminatory practices 
had hurt minority contractors the department said 
the justice department said the high court should not give any 
deference to the fccs policy of giving preference to minority 
license because the program was not specifically mandated by 
congress 
here there can be no claim that congress had before it 
evidence suggesting that minorities have been denied any 
opportunity to acquire broadcasting facilities because of official 
or private acts of discrimination 
the justice department said it found no legal support for the 
proposition that a federal administrative agency acting under a 
general grand of authority to regulate a particular industry in the 
public interest should be entitled to any special deference if it 
makes a finding of prior discrimination within that industry 
that might support the use of racial classifications

accompanied by soviet scientists officials and interpreters 
committee members saw parts of an experiment to develop a device 
that would fire a socalled particle beam in space they also saw 
the aurora laser project part of an effort to develop nuclear 
fusion a technology cleaner that the current fission process used 
in nuclearpowered electric plants 
reporters were excluded from the tour and officials gave only a 
sketchy account 
in response to a reporters shouted question what do you want 
to see here and relayed through a translator a member of the 
soviet delegation responded you and gestured with a smile at 
the laboratory 
the group was led by committee chairman vladimir lapygin who 
was greeted at the labs main headquarters by james jackson deputy

an american man was found shot to death amid 
ancient stone ruins in the andean city of cuzco perus tourism 
center and once the capital of the incas police said friday 
cuzco police spokesman maj rafael zavala said the body was 
found shot in the head on thursday at sacsayhuaman a group of huge 
incan stone ruins on a hill that overlooks the city 
zavala said a us passport carrying the name charles john 
williams 42 was found with the victim 
however the state department in washington identified the dead 
american as william carlos yount 41 of southern pines nc and 
said no american named williams had died in cuzco 
us embassy spokesman tom leary said in lima that police

zavala said he had no information on whether the victim was a 
tourist or how long he had been in cuzco which is 355 miles 
southwest of lima he said police had no suspects but that the 
investigation was continuing 
tourism is a major source of revenue in peru bringing more than 
400 million a year into the country according to the government 
however the number of tourists coming to peru has dropped for 
several years due to guerrilla violence that is affecting much of 
the andean highlands and some urban areas 
cuzco has been relatively unaffected by the political violence 
and thousands of tourists still pour through the city each year 
police said earlier friday that maoist guerrillas of the shining 
path shot nine people to death in scattered violence throughout 
peru 
the victims included two policemen a teacher a government 
worker and three men the rebels accused of stealing cattle two 
women also were killed in their home 
the policemen were gunned down in an outlying district of lima 
by a group of rebels in a passing truck thursday night police 
said the attackers stopped and took the victims revolvers before 
fleeing the police said 
the bodies of three men who had been shot were found friday in 
the highland village of san pedro de sano 140 miles east of lima 
a handwritten sign found on one of the victims read this is 
how cattle rustlers die police said 
the village of 3000 is currently without a local government 
the mayor judge and police chief have resigned due to rebel 
threats 
rebels killed a high school teacher thursday by shooting him in 
the head in his home in ayacucho 235 miles southeast of lima 
police said 
also thursday the bodies of a 45yearold woman and her 
22yearold daughter were found in their home in ayacucho police 
said the two women had been shot to death 
other rebels thursday stopped two men in a truck as they were 
driving to a government irrigation project in huanta 200 miles 
southeast of lim according to police the passenger an employee 
at the project was ordered by the rebels to lie on the ground he 
was then shot in the head police said 
the driver told police the rebels did not kill him because he 
told them he was not associated with the government project 
the maoinspired shining path launched its armed insurgency 
against perus elected governments in 1980 the government says 
more than 17500 people have died in the violence

a former danbury mayor accused of 
extorting more than 100000 from developers while in office was 
found innocent friday of all charges in his federal corruption 
trial except a single count of tax fraud 
james e dyer broke into a slight smile as us district judge 
jose cabranes repeated the words not guilty six times before 
reading the jurys guilty verdict on the final of seven counts 
dyer had been charged with one count of racketeering two counts 
of extortion and four counts of filing false federal tax returns 
he was the first elected official in connecticut ever charged under 
the federal racketeer influenced corrupt organizations act 
all i can say for now is im relieved dyer said after the 
verdicts were returned he called the verdicts an absolutely 
unmitigated victory 
dyer thanked jurors as they filed out of the courtroom then 
hugged his wife alice who wept as the verdicts were read the 
jury deliberated 2 days before reaching a verdict 
this is a case that was worth bringing us attorney 
stanley a twardy said it was a tough fight it was a fair fight 
and its over 
dyer who is to be sentenced april 10 faces up to three years 
in prison and a 250000 fine for his conviction on a single count 
of filing a false income tax return 
he failed to list on his 1986 tax return a capital gain of 
10000 from the sale of his condominium after learning he was 
under investigation he filed an amended return and paid the 3500 
in taxes due 
dyer had faced 72 years in prison and 16 million in fines if 
he had been convicted on all counts 
his attorney hugh keefe said they hadnt decided whether to 
appeal the single count or discuss what sentence the government 
will seek for dyer 
they just nicked jimmy and they cant very well punish him for 
something the jury didnt convict him of keefe said 
the jury rejected the far more serious allegations that dyer 
danburys democratic mayor from 1979 through 1987 took nearly 
115000 from developers to assure his support for their projects 
in the city and ran the mayors office as a racketeering 
enterprise during his last five years in office 
dyer called witnesses who testified that they paid him off a 
load of liars 
the idea that i sat in my office and asked these guys for 
money is ridiculous dyer said as waited for the verdict to come 
in friday morning 
twardy said dyer would be barred from running for public office 
again as a convicted felon 
dyer said his only immediate plans are to spend time with his 
family and return to work as the marketing director at applied data 
inc in north haven

voters in this remote western pacific 
archipelago failed to approve a political arrangement that would 
give it more selfgovernment its president officially told the 
us government friday 
a majority of voters supported the proposal but the island 
chains constitution requires a 75 percent majority 
president ngiratkel etpison in a letter written friday to 
assistant us interior secretary stella g guerra said he has 
asked palaus congress for legislation to amend the constitution to 
allow a compact of free association to be approved by simple 
majority of the voters 
the 30member congress is expected to go into special session 
late this month 
the proposed compact already us law provides for 
selfgovernment more control over internal and foreign affairs 
and nearly 500 million in economic aid it also would end palaus 
nearly 43 years as a un strategic trusteeship under us 
authority ten other territories formed in 1947 under the 
trustreeship system have achieved independence or selfgovernment 
 
the united states captured the islands in 1944 from japan 
with about 85 percent of the votes counted from a plebiscite 
tuesday about 60 percent of palaus voters supported the proposed 
compact and its subsidiary agreements the vote was 3906 for the 
agreements 2573 against 
counting of the remaining 1164 ballots was to resume saturday 
morning 
it was the seventh attempt in seven years to obtain the 75 
percent margin 
opponents of the pact complained their land could be used by the 
united states for military purposes or they wouldnt receive 
adequate compensation for their land 
some opposition was based on antinuclear sentiment although 
the united states has said it wont store test or dispose of 
nuclear or other unconventional weapons in the islands the compact 
would allow nuclearcapable ships and aircraft to use palau waters 
and airspace 
the cluster of 200 islands 600 miles east of the philippines and 
4500 miles southwest of hawaii has an estimated 15000 people 
residing on eight of the volcanic islands an estimated 5000 to 
7000 palauans live overseas

protesters targeting the majority white 
school board and alleged police brutality promised to continue 
their occupation of selma high school and city hall for a second 
night friday 
also friday city officials said an investigation of the alleged 
brutality had cleared an officer accused of using excessive force 
when he arrested a black protest leader 
mayor joe smitherman released a preliminary report into the 
claim that officer ronnie rushing abused protest leader rose 
sanders when she was arrested monday and carried from the mayors 
office 
city attorney henry pitts who announced the findings of the 
citys investigation said there is no evidence to support any 
allegation of physical or sexual abuse 
mrs sanders who charged into the mayors private office as a 
melee erupted in an outer room claimed the policeman touched her 
private parts with his nightstick and dragged her to police 
headquarters with her jogging pants around her knees 
according to the citys report rushing twice asked mrs sanders 
to leave the police car when they arrived at jail but she refused 
the officer then put his baton between her handcuffs and pulled her 
from the car 
during the walk to the jail mrs sanders went limp and rushing 
and another officer had to drag her to an elevator the report said 
from the time she was first arrested she was uncooperative 
and refused to obey his orders the report said 
although the citys probe cleared the officer of wrongdoing 
rushing was placed on administrative duty friday until the fbi 
justice department and alabama bureau of investigation complete 
their investigations 
blacks staged allnight sleepins at city hall and selma high 
school awaiting the report at the high school where about 150 
students former students and adults spent thursday night in the 
cafeteria doors were locked friday morning but police did not try 
to enter 
students said they discussed black history and watched films 
including the color purple 
later friday six parents and about two dozen students briefly 
occupied city school board offices in a building one block from 
city hall 
they left without incident after chanting no contract no 
school a reference to protesters calls for the white majority 
school board to extend the contract of superintendent norward 
roussell beyond june when it expires 
roussell is the first black school superintendent in selma the 
board voted in december against extending his contract setting off 
weeks of protests and periodic school boycotts 
his supporters contend the majority white board refused to 
extend his contract because he is black and because he lessened the 
impact of a tracking system that allegedly tended to separate 
blacks from whites on the basis of classroom levels of achievement 
white board members who removed roussell from office last week 
but reinstated him tuesday as racial tensions forced the closing of 
two schools have cited a critical evaluation of roussells 
managerial skills in his 80000ayear post 
all 11 public schools in the 70 percent black 6000student 
system have been closed since wednesday because of what school 
officials call the threat of violence the schools are scheduled to 
reopen monday 
besides protesting roussells treatment black protest leaders 
have called for a change in the way the school board is formed the 
board with six whites and five blacks is appointed by the city 
council which has five whites and four blacks 
the protest broadened to include the treatment of mrs sanders 
after she and four others were arrested on misdemeanor charges 
monday but she said the protests focus should not be on her but 
on what she called a racially unfair educational system 
her husband state sen hank sanders said the main issue is not 
that schoolchildren are missing three days in class at stake he 
said is the quality of education for the future 
ozell sutton regional director for the justice departments 
community relations service division said he arrived for meetings 
with both sides 
everybody is receptive he said the problem is everybody 
wants the situation resolved in their favor

a judge cleared the way friday for joseph 
hazelwoods lawyers to blame us coast guard negligence rather 
than the skipper for the nations larget oil spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone said he had decided to allow 
crossexamination of two coast guard traffic monitors on the role 
the agencys vessel traffic system played in the march 24 grounding 
of the 987foot tanker exxon valdez 
after brief legal arguments he allowed for the monitors to be 
questioned about how closely they were watching radar and whether 
they had a duty to notify hazelwood that his ship was approaching 
rocky bligh reef 
however johnstone refused for now to admit in evidence a blood 
alcohol test given to one of the monitors 1315 hours after the 
disaster at sea 
the test showed that bruce blandford had a blood alcohol reading 
of 203 more than twice the legal limit for driving in alaska 
blandford has said he had four drinks of bourbon and water when he 
returned home after the accident 
johnstone said he would reconsider his ruling if hazelwoods 
lawyer dick madson can prove relevance madson said he planned to 
call experts to say that a few drinks after work could not have 
produced such a high blood alcohol reading in blandford he 
maintains the monitor was drinking while on duty 
on thursday johnstone refused to admit the results of a urine 
test showing that the second monitor gregory taylor tested 
positive for marijuana three days after the accident 
also friday the alaska supreme court rejected hazelwoods 
request for a hearing on whether he was immune from prosecution 
the former skipper had claimed he was the first to report the spill 
and that state and federal law grants immunity from prosecution to 
those who make such reports 
most of the testimony in the trials first week has focused on 
liquor the prosecution maintains that hazelwood spent the hours 
before his ship set sail drinking vodka with his shipmates and was 
drunk when the exxon valdez ran aground just after midnight 
the tanker spilled almost 11 million gallons of north slope 
crude blackening hundreds of miles of shoreline killing thousands 
of animals and hundreds of thousands of birds exxon says it has 
spent some 2 billion trying to clean up the mess 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating 
a vessel while intoxicated 
the maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years 
three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
testimony was to resume monday with taylor and blandford 
scheduled as witnesses

workers blotted up gooey blobs 
from along miles of beaches and boats skimmed oil offshore friday 
as the slick from a punctured tanker drifted off the scenic coast 
the spill of up to 300000 gallons of alaskan crude oil from the 
tanker american trader sent globules and a sheen ashore thursday 
night at spots along several miles of beaches south of los angeles 
newport beach five miles down the coast from huntington got a 
brown tide of quartersize globs and that city declared a state of 
emergency 
the 811foot tanker carried 21 million gallons when its 
singlewall hull was punctured apparently by an anchor as it 
approached an oil pipeline mooring about 1 miles offshore 
wednesday night 
several hundred workers hired by the oil shipper and volunteers 
worked around the clock to soak up the goo at newport they had 
filled some 800 large trash bags with towels sand and oil by 
friday morning 
sixteenyearold lisa virak skipped school friday and came to 
the beach with a roll of paper towels and a pair of rubber gloves 
i came because its part of our community youve got to keep 
the beach clean the newspaper says it will take two years but i 
dont think itll take that long with everyones help she said 
newport beach city officials were pleased by the effort said 
city fire capt ray pendleton the impact has been less than we 
thought he said 
are we out of the woods no not yet said charles webster 
crisis manager for british petroleum america inc which owns the 
oil and chartered the tanker but were working to stay ahead of 
the curve 
booms had been placed across the entrances to the bolsa chica 
wetlands the santa ana river and upper newport bay and there were 
no reports of oil reaching those wildlife habitats 
coast guard rear adm william kime said the soiled shoreline 
measured 1 miles at huntington and threequarters of a mile at 
newport the slick stretched 5 miles by 7 miles from bolsa chica 
state beach to newport beach 
there was concern the slick might drift south to laguna beach a 
scenic art colony fronted by rocky tide pools webster said a 
cleanup firm was on call there 
the cleanup bill has already reached the millions of 
dollars kime told a news conference in huntington beach he 
noted that results of federally mandated drug and alcohol tests of 
the ships officers were negative 
cleanup costs were to be borne by the ships owner american 
trading transportation co inc of new york webster said british 
petroleum said it had 390 cleanup workers along a 20mile stretch 
of coast from bolsa chica to laguna beach eight skimmers were at 
work and five more were due by days end four others were en route 
skimmers had collected 16800 gallons of oil by 7 am friday 
kime said 
the tanker remained off huntington beach as the coast guard 
pumped remaining oil and water out of the forward hold which may 
have been gashed by its anchor as it was mooring at an offshore 
pipeline ships unload their cargo into the pipeline for transport 
to an inland oil refinery 
it looks like the vessel rode up over its anchor and punctured 
itself kime said 
the 1 million gallons of oil left in the forward compartment was 
being pumped onto a barge the ship has stopped leaking the coast 
guard said 
since the spill began 49 oilsoaked sea birds have been brought 
to a wildlife aid station for cleaning said california department 
of fish and game biologist john grant twelve died 
except for the change in wind direction that pushed tentacles of 
the slick ashore sea and weather conditions were favorable 
federal and local authorities noted their luck but remained 
cautious 
to date weve been lucky said john turner director of the 
us fish and wildlife service theres a lot of oil that could 
come ashore 
the spill is tiny in comparison to that unleashed when the 
tanker exxon valdez struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound 
last year spewing more than 10 million gallons the alaska spill 
had more than 30 times the amount of oil as the current california 
spill 
turner said the state department of fish and game director had 
decided against using chemical dispersants on the slick and he 
concurred 
the proximity to the shore was a key in the decision here 
he said 
the potential toxic affects of the chemicals on animals was also 
considered along with the fact that chemicals and a dispersal plane 
could not have reached the scene for 36 hours turner said by then 
the spill was too broken up for chemicals to be effective he said 
fish and wildlife experts also went out in a boat to try to 
determine the extent of harm to the environment 
huntington beach is a city of 180000 about 35 miles southeast 
of los angeles newport beach about five miles down the coast has 
about 70000 residents

former president reagan on friday agreed to 
answer questions about his role in the irancontra affair in 
videotaped testimony for the upcomig trial of john poindexter 
reagan said he will respond to questions from poindexter but 
said he or the bush administration could invoke executive privilege 
to avoid answering specific questions during the deposition 
the expresident proposed in a court filing that he give the 
videotaped deposition in los angeles feb 16 four days before the 
scheduled start of poindexters criminal trial 
us district court judge harold greene scheduled a hearing for 
monday to consider the timing and circumstances of the videotaped 
deposition 
on monday poindexter was given approval by a federal judge to 
ask reagan 154 questions about the irancontra affair greene gave 
reagan until friday to decide whether he would invoke a blanket 
claim of executive privilege in an attempt to avoid giving the 
deposition altogether 
reagan recognizes that this court has a considerable 
responsibility to protect and preserve the rights of the defendant 
in this case as well as to be sensitive to the interests of the 
former president and the constitutional rights and duties of the 
presidency reagans lawyers said in court papers 
they said reagan recognizes that the videotape deposition 
format will provide an appropriate mechanism to protect 
sensitive classified national security information and 
confidential deliberations 
greene said monday that poindexter would be permitted to ask 
followup questions in addition to the 154 main questions the 
subject areas include reagans knowledge of oliver norths 
activities and whether reagan authorized written responses to 
congress for which poindexter now faces felony charges 
in a separate filing the bush administration said it would also 
waive executive privilege to allow the former president to give the 
deposition 
but bush administration reserved the right to invoke the 
privilege to prevent reagan from answering followup questions 
during the deposition that might involve the foreign policy 
deliberations within the presidents office 
specificially the bush administration expressed concern about 
questions that seek to delve into the nature of various 
communications between former president reagan and foreign heads of 
state which are to our knowledge still undisclosed and 
sensitive 
but in the filing the justice department said it did not find 
serious problems with the 154 questions for reagan that have 
been approved by the judge 
giving testimony by videotape away from public view will provide 
an opportunity to stop the questioning if it impinges on sensitive 
national security or diplomatic matters 
greene will attend the deposition and rule on disputes 
the former president will defer to the incumbent president 
with respect to issues of executive privilege that may arise during 
the deposition said reagans lawyers 
reagan could still invoke executive privilege with regard to 
specific questions if his lawyers deemed it appropriate possibly 
terminating the deposition and triggering a protracted legal battle 
in the courts 
assuming the deposition is completed the edited videotape would 
be shown at poindexters trial 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of making false statements charges that 
carry a maximum of 25 years in prison and 125 million in fines 
upon conviction poindexter asserts that reagan approved of 
activities that led to criminal charges against his former national 
security adviser 
on monday reagan invoked executive privilege in an attempt to 
avoid turning over to poindexter approximately 33 presidential 
diary entries that claim is being reviewed by greene who is 
presiding in poindexters case 
greene wanted the question of reagans testimony resolved before 
the trial saying it would be difficult if not impossible for 
poindexter to formulate a coherent strategy without knowing in 
advance whether the former president will answer questions 
the expresident would be asked about his knowledge of the 
relationship between north and specific individuals in both the 
iran arms sales and secret assistance to the contras 
reagan told the tower board on jan 26 1987 that he did not 
know the staff of the national security council where north 
worked was helping the contras the board said it was aware of no 
evidence to suggest that the president was aware of norths 
activities 
reagan also would be asked whether he approved responses to 
congress inquiring into whether north was assisting the contras 
in the responses poindexter endorsed letters sent to congress a 
year earlier by national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
poindexters predecessor denying that north was raising money or 
providing military advice to the contras mcfarlane in 1988 pleaded 
guilty to withholding information from congress in connection with 
the letters 
one question reagan would be asked 
did you advise admiral poindexter to inform the congressional 
committees that the information sought had already been 
provided to them and that this information made it clear that the 
actions of the nsc staff were in compliance with the law 
reagan also would be asked about discussions with poindexter 
regarding a chronology on the iran arms sales that is involved in 
four of the five criminal charges against poindexter 
the chronology prepared by others at poindexters direction 
falsely states that no one in the us government knew until 
january 1986 that a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment from iran 
to israel contained hawk missiles 
president ford gave a videotaped deposition in the criminal 
trial of lynette fromme in the assassination attempt on ford 
president carter provided a videotaped deposition in the criminal 
trial of a state senator and a sheriff on gambling conspiracy 
charges carter while in office also gave videotaped testimony 
for a grand jury investigation of an alleged white house attempt to 
quash extradition proceedings against an international fugitive

government on foreign artists performing in malaysia he did not 
say what these conditions were 
i am very disappointed and was really looking forward to 
meeting my wonderful fans in malaysia and warming their hearts on 
valentines day ms jackson said late friday i guess this

the canadian dollar went into a tailspin friday 
after prime minister brian mulroney said interest rates will likely 
fall when a federal budget aimed at reducing the deficit is 
released this month 
the drop forced the bank of canada to jump into the market 
where it bought unwanted dollars and forced rates higher to defend 
the currency 
after the next budget on feb 20 you will begin to see the 
downward trend of interest rates by years end mulroney said 
in an interview with the canadian press 
the currency began falling minutes after mulroneys remark was 
reported it closed at 8321 us cents a drop of more than half a 
penny from thursdays close and nearly threequarters of a cent 
down from its friday high 
mulroney later stood by his comment 
i believe the policies taken by finance minister michael 
wilson will have the general effect of lowering interest rates i 
believe those policies will increase canadas competitiveness and 
enhance our economy 
like the us government canada is wrestling with a large 
budget deficit which can drive up interest rates when money is 
borrowed to finance it 
in the year ending march 31 canada ran a deficit of 305 
billion canadian on a budget of 143 billion canadian in a country 
of 25 million people 
the canadian dollar has been under siege since last month when 
the bank of canada reversed its longstanding policy and eased 
interest rates the move triggered a run on the dollar and the 
market has been jittery ever since 
on thursday the bank of canada boosted its bellwether bank rate 
to 1279 percent the highest level in 5 years in a bid to stop 
the continued selloff of canadian dollars it marked the third 
week of rate increases which influence the level of broader 
consumer and business loan rates

a lawyer said friday he has new evidence to file 
for a retrial in the case of jeffrey macdonald a former army 
doctor found guilty in 1979 of murdering his pregnant wife and two 
children 
this time weve got it nailed cold said harvey silverglate 
who was acquainted with macdonald while both were students at 
princeton university some years ago 
silverglate who hasnt previously represented macdonald 
refused to disclose the nature of the evidence but said it was 
startling 
some of it is newly discovered some of it is known to the 
prosecution and was suppressed at the time of the trial 
silverglate said we have the heart of the evidence but we are 
still pursuing a few strings and are in the process of pulling 
it all together 
the attorney said he planned to file a retrial motion in the 
spring at which time the new evidence would be made public 
a book about the case fatal vision was written by joe 
mcginnis and later made into a television movie 
macdonald a former physician and green beret was convicted of 
fatally stabbing and bludgeoning his 26yearold wife and daughters 
while he was stationed at fort bragg nc in 1970 he has 
contended his family was victimized by a band of drugcrazed 
hippies 
his conviction was reversed in 1980 by a richmond vabased 
appeals court on grounds he was denied a speedy trial but the us 
supreme court subsequently overturned that ruling 
in 1985 a federal court denied macdonalds request for a 
retrial but silverglate said this time it was a different 
story

the sign said no ingles no travato 
a mangled attempt at the spanish for no english no work 
but even if it had been spelled right no ingles no 
trabajo the placard posted outside a construction site near 
greeley probably would have been illegal state and federal 
officials say 
jorge amaya state director of the league of united latin 
american citizens said he confronted the construction foreman at 
the sand livestock systems construction trailer thursday after he 
spotted the sign 
that sign was telling a whole group of people to get lost and 
thats discrimination he said 
its exactly the kind of thing we feared when the official 
english amendment passed in a 1988 referendum ill tell you if 
we put up a sign saying no more white people wed get nailed in 
seconds 
the posting marks the latest shot fired in the battle over 
official english statutes which have been enacted in dozens of 
states in the past few years they are intended to discourage 
bilingual education and other concessions to nonenglishspeaking 
immigrants 
on tuesday a federal judge in phoenix tossed out arizonas 
official english law saying it violated the right to free speech 
that law required state and county governments in arizona to 
conduct most of their business in english only 
colorados constitutional amendment is less specific it simply 
declares english to be the official state language without 
describing what that means 
to officials at a hog farm under construction for national farms 
in kersey about 10 miles east of greeley in northcentral 
colorado the amendment meant that spanishspeakers could be 
discouraged from applying for work 
we had some pretty poor communications around here said 
project superintendant al benson we were getting so many people 
who couldnt speak english for example i have a cement finisher i 
cant even talk to 
the sign was posted last summer benson said he insisted that 
it was legal 
we checked he said because of the englishonly bill we 
know its legal 
but state and federal officials disagreed 
ed gibbs regional officer for the colorado civil rights 
commission in greeley said the sign was definitely illegal 
no one had filed a complaint with his office but gibbs said he 
would investigate the incident and the company could be ordered to 
pay damages to anyone who could prove they were discriminated 
against because of the sign 
joe esquibel of the us labor department said the sign is 
probably illegal because the construction business isnt one 
that requires english to be spoken 
another labor department official loren gilbert said that 
unless english is an occupational qualification as for example 
for a disc jockey it is illegal to refuse to hire people because 
they dont speak the language 
you cant tell me that english is a requirement for digging 
post holes he said 
amaya of the league of united latin american citizens said he 
intends to file complaints with the labor department and the state 
civil rights commission 
the local manager for national farms bill ohare said he had 
been unaware of the subcontractors sign he said national farms 
allows all people to apply for jobs and we do not discriminate in 
any manner

the first flight test of the socalled 
brilliant pebbles system under the strategic defense initiative 
is scheduled for this summer the pentagon announced on friday 
the defense department has ruled that the test complies with 
the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 which bans 
antimissile weapons in orbit sdi officials announced 
president bush touted the brilliant pebbles concept earlier 
this week when he visited a major star wars research laboratory in 
california 
in his latest budget bush has asked for 45 billion for the 
socalled star wars spacebased antimissile shield in the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 nearly a 1 billion more in the current 
fiscal year 
congress cut 1 billion from bushs 48 billion star wars 
request for this year 
the brilliant pebbles idea envisions deploying thousands of 
tiny maneuverable satellites packed with sensors to detect enemy 
missiles in lowearth orbit where they could ram and destroy the 
missiles if commanded to do so 
at a briefing and in documents handed to reporters sdi 
officials said the cost of putting a brilliant pebbles system 
in space under the strategic defense initiative has been cut by 
some 20 percent because of technological advances 
technological progress and an evolving architecture for the 
spacebased portion of phase i now permit projected cost figures 
near 55 billion expressed in dollars of 1988 buying power the 
sdi office said 
in june 1988 officials estimated the cost of a phase i missile 
defense to be 115 billion but that estimate was reduced to 69 
billion in october of 1988 
the new lower estimate appears to be due to the shifting of 
emphasis to the brilliant pebbles sypstem and because the 
advances allow scientists to make smaller less expensive devices

the young amp rubicam inc advertising 
agency pleaded guilty friday to making improper payments to a 
jamaican businessman in its efforts to win the jamaican government 
tourism account 
in a plea agreement the government dropped racketeering and 
bribery charges against the new yorkbased agency and two of its 
executives 
the company was fined 500000 for conspiring to violate the 
foreign corrupt practices act by paying 130000 to arnold foote 
jr while having reason to know that foote might offer bribes 
to eric anthony abrahams the former minister of tourism in 
jamaica said us attorney stanley a twardy 
the company had faced fines of up to 75 million on the bribery 
and racketeering charges 
us district judge peter dorsey also placed the company on 
probation for two years and said he would consider ordering the 
agency to perform community service 
young amp rubicam said friday that some of its employees did on 
occasions hear reports of alleged bribery efforts but that the 
company still has no reason to believe that foote ever bribed 
abrahams 
further the company said the government now agrees that young 
amp rubicam won the jamaica account fairly 
the agency pointed out that the reason to know section of 
the corrupt practices act was considered controversial and was 
removed by congress in 1988 
ironically if the case were brought today there would have 
been no such charge the company said 
the government alleged in an indictment last year that young amp 
rubicam made the payments of 900000 to win and retain the 
lucrative jamaican tourism account for which it produced the 
awardwinning come back to jamaica campaign in the early 1980s 
in the indictment the government characterized foote as an 
adviser to abrahams and thus a public official as defined under the 
corrupt practices act 
until friday the agency denied any wrongdoing maintaining it 
hired foote to help with the account and that he was not a public 
official 
federal prosecutors citing exculpatory evidence recently 
turned over to the government dropped charges against two young 
amp rubicam executives who faced racketeering charges executive vice 
president arthur r klein and former account supervisor thomas 
spangenberg 
a third young amp rubicam employee steven m mckenna faces 
federal perjury charges his trial is scheduled to begin feb 26 
foote and abrahams have also been charged but they remain in 
jamaica twardy said he has been advised by the justice department 
that he cannot extradite foote and abrahams on racketeering charges 
under current jamaican law 
the settlement came the day after jury selection began in 
federal court in the trial of the agency

west german opposition politicians said 
friday their government has information that libyas controversial 
rabta chemical plant has begun producing poison gas 
a government spokesman in bonn when asked about the 
allegations said we cannot take a position at this time 
reinhard kraemer a spokesman for the environmentalist greens 
party in bonn said the greens have received information that the 
plant has produced enough poison gas for 1000 artillery shells 
a us official in washington said friday that the libyans have 
been producing very small amounts of chemicals possibly for 
weapons use for about a year 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the plant 
60 miles south of tripoli is producing nowhere near its design 
capacity and that the united states is monitoring the situation 
but that nothing has occurred the past year to raise further alarms 
the libyan government of col moammar gadhafi has denied the 
rabta plant was designed to produce poison gas saying it instead 
is for the production of pharmaceuticals 
ali sunni muntasser libyas deputy representative to the united 
nations said friday night all these stories about manufacturing 
gases or chemicals or anything is untrue 
albrecht mueller a federal lawmaker with the main opposition 
social democratic party said he was told by a west german 
government official the rabta plant is making poison gas 
he said the information was released during a meeting wednesday 
of the parliamentary economics committee 
i gathered from the meeting the production started last 
year mueller told the associated press in a telephone interview 
he said an economics ministry official identified the chemical 
name as lost which is a military term for 
dichlordiaethylsulphide a poison gas that renders opponents unable 
to fight when it comes into contact with the skin 
mueller said he had heard from other sources that the rabta 
plant has produced more than 20 tons of the poison gas since last 
year he would not identify the other sources 
kraemer the greens spokesman said we have information that 
the libyan chemical plant in rabta has produced large amounts of 
lost gas enough to arm 1000 shells 
kraemer said he could not be more specific on where the party 
had obtained the information 
other sources in bonn speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the matter came up at closeddoor meetings of the parliamentary 
foreign committee as well as the economics committee 
the rabta plant caused a huge scandal for west germany last year 
with us allegations that west german firms helped build the plant 
west germany at first denied the us allegations but 
ultimately launched its own investigation and accused the 
imhausenchemie firm of helping build the libyan plant 
the investigation has not yet been concluded 
mueller said he did not recall the name of the economics 
ministry official who released the information 
he said members of the committee were deeply disturbed when 
they heard the allegations 
mueller said he did not know where the economics ministry 
official got the information but that he assumed it came from 
intelligence sources 
this was a very embarrassing affair from the state and 
continues to be one said mueller

its important to remember that the battle of armageddon was to 
begin in an area in israel according to the prophecy

parliament on friday restored a golden 
crown to polands national emblem the eagle recreating the prewar 
symbol of independence after a debate so emotional one member 
suggested former communists had no right to vote 
deputies elected as members of the nowdissolved communist party 
started to walk out in protest and a hasty recess was called 
before parliament voted overwhelmingly to go back to the national 
symbol used from 1927 until the nazi occupation in 1939 
the white eagle with a golden crown beak and talons its wings 
outspread and turned to the right on a red shieldshaped 
background will replace the uncrowned white eagle that decorated 
government offices and official documents during 45 years of 
communist rule after world war ii 
it was with this eagle that we lost our independence first 
under western nazi german and then under eastern soviet 
force said piotr nowinakonopka a minister of state to 
president wojciech jaruzelski who proposed the new symbol 
despite that it survived in polish homes and families as 
well as among poles abroad as a symbolic sign awaiting better 
times ahead 
the postwar communist government rejected the crowned eagle as a 
symbol of poland monarchial past 
poles began agitating for restoration of the crown almost as 
soon as the solidarityled government replaced the communists in 
september 
parliament voted 3163 with 52 abstentions friday to return the 
crown reshape stars on the eagle to avoid any resemblence to 
soviet red stars and remove a border around the shield that was 
the heraldic symbol of illegitimacy 
documents currency and other uses of the old emblem will be 
valid until the end of 1995 although official signs must be 
changed by dec 31 1992 
the debate friday was whether the eagles crown should have a 
cross too 
when poland was restored as an independent nation following 
world war i the eagles crown included a small cross this was 
removed in 1927 reflecting the nations religious diversity 
but poland is more than 90 percent roman catholic now following 
the obliteration of the jewish population during world war ii and 
the annexation by the soviet union of polish lands home to its 
ukrainian and byelorussion minorities 
the cross was rejected however and solidarity deputy jan 
lopuszanski then rose to address the 173 parliament members elected 
to seats guaranteed last year to the communist party 
i have a moral appeal to the left side of the hall i think 
that this voting should take place without you i think you would 
be right to abstain from voting on this issue he said 
amid murmurings about a dozen excommunist deputies rose to 
leave 
sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewicz immediately called a recess of 
the lower house to avert a walkout later a deputy said the 
solidarity caucus rejected lopuszanskis view

students at the nations top colleges now 
are more likely to be from upper middleclass families than from 
old money according to a study released friday 
the new elite is defined more by intellectual achievement than 
family tradition but is an exclusive one nonetheless two 
sociology professors say in their study of the freshman class that 
enrolled in 1986 
its not the old gentry any more said professor lionel s 
lewis of the state university of new york at buffalo theyve 
incorporated the upper middle class and professional class 
lewis and his coauthor paul william kingston of the university 
of virginia compared freshmen entering all colleges and 
universities that year to those who enrolled in the 76 most 
selective schools as defined by the american council on education 
those are schools where the freshman class averaged at least 1175 
of a possible 1600 points on the scholastic aptitude test 
that would be the ivy league schools and the prestigious 
colleges oberlin swarthmore haverford places like that 
lewis said 
more than 60 percent of the freshmen at the selective schools 
came from families with income of at least 50000 a year compared 
with 31 percent overall nearly 25 percent of the freshmen at 
selective schools came from families with incomes of 100000 or 
more compared with 7 percent overall 
the freshmen admitted to those schools are unquestionably chosen 
for their academic merit and extracurricular achievements rather 
than family wealth or connections but merit is measured on a 
yardstick that favors the affluent lewis and kingston said in an 
article in the journal academe 
most students who are meritorious in the conventional sense 
come from highincome families where they have enjoyed special 
opportunities children from lowerincome families acquire 
relatively fewer linguistic and cultural skills the professors 
wrote 
the allaround person is an upperclass value and the 
dominance of this value in the admissions process has made it 
possible for elite private institutions to tighten their academic 
requirements for admission and still cater to the privileged 
many of the top schools say their admissions policies are 
needblind and promise to give all students as much financial 
aid as they need but lewis said those policies arent designed to 
attract students from lowerincome backgrounds 
the first part of financial aid is always a student loan then 
they give workstudy then after that they might give some kind 
of a grant lewis said in an interview if you accept any form 
of student aid youre going to have to borrow and some people 
choose not to do that 
he said an increase in meritbased scholarships might be part of 
the solution but other issues would remain such as the 
possibility that poorer students might feel uncomfortable at those 
schools or that the sat and other admissions criteria discriminate 
against the poor and minorities 
i dont have a pat and easy answer he said the problem 
is the problem of inequality in our society

the plo came under fire friday in a 
government newspaper editorial for failing to condemn a terrorist 
attack on a bus carrying israeli tourists in egypt that left nine 
dead 
sources close to the government say relations have chilled with 
the palestine liberation organization which could endanger efforts 
by the united states to initiate israelipalestinian peace talks 
because egypt is acting as surrogate for the plo in the process 
in a related development one of the israeli survivors has given 
a authorities a videotape he took of last sundays attack which 
may help track down the assailants newspaper reports said 
ibrahim nafei editor of the leading governmentowned newspaper 
alahram said in an editorial friday that a plo statement on the 
attack was flimsy and weak to say the least it is not at all 
commensurate with the magnitude and monstrosity of this bus 
incident 
he said he was reluctant to say the statement conflicts with 
the plos renunciation of terrorist acts 
in the ambush two masked gunmen killed nine israelis and 
wounded 20 with hand grenades and automatic weapons fire on a 
desert road between cairo and the suez canal an egyptian tour 
guide also was wounded 
the sources said egyptianplo relations have deteriorated so far 
that the estimated 3500040000 palestinians in egypt have come 
under government scrutiny they said breaches of travel and 
residence rules have been uncovered in the checks that followed 
strong hints of a palestinian connection in the bus incident 
it was the worst chill since president hosni mubarak shut down 
seven plo offices in egypt for seven months in 1987 the closure 
was to protest criticism by the palestine national council the 
organizations parliament in exile of egypts 1979 peace treaty 
with israel 
egypt resents a statement issued monday from plo headquarters in 
the tunisian capital tunis that failed to condemn the bus attack 
it appeared to equate the killing of israelis on the bus with the 
killing by israelis of palestinians in the 2yearold uprising in 
the occupied west bank and gaza 
faisal husseni a leading proplo activist in the territories 
had condemned the attack saying such violence comes from groups 
who are fed by the stubbon israeli position in the peace process 
 
the statement by the plo distributed by the organizations news 
agency wafa also obliquely criticized egypts peace with israel 
and us disregard of the plo in washingtonled peace efforts 
on thursday mubarak sent a message to plo chairman yasser 
arafat which the sources said was believed to have conveyed 
cairos displeasure over the organizations position 
the plos cairo representative saeed kamal said he relayed 
mubaraks verbal message to arafat by telephone neither he nor 
egyptian officials would discuss its contents 
about 100 people mostly palestinians have been detained for 
questioning in the attack including the bus driver and the man who 
rented the peugoet according to a police source 
in an interview published saturday in the cairo newspaper 
algomhouria interior minister abdelhalim moussa said a videotape 
shot by pinchas first one of the israeli survivors recorded the 
voice and faces of the attackers 
i used my camera right from the start of the attack and im 
sure that i managed to film the assailants first said in an 
interview with the israeli newspaper yediot ahronot

secretary of state james a baker iii reported 
progress toward agreements cutting long range nuclear warheads 
troops in europe and chemical weapons in marathon talks friday with 
mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet officials 
the soviet president urged bush to modify his new proposal for 
troop reductions in europe to eliminate a 30000soldier advantage 
for the united states and baker labeled the counterproposal very 
interesting 
baker said he and the soviets made headway on a number of other 
fronts and clashed over cuba in negotiations designed to pave 
the way for a summit next summer between gorbachev and president 
bush 
if you ask me if i am pleased at what we are able to do here 
i am very pleased baker said at a midnight news conference after 
long sessions with gorbachev and then with foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze 
he said the talks made headway very very smartly toward a 
treaty on longrange missiles 
the two sides also prepared to announce on saturday soviet 
approval of a usproposed phased plan for the abolition of 
chemical weapons 
the two superpowers the only nations to acknowledge possesion 
of chemical weapons already have agreed in principle on the deep 
cuts outlined by bush at a united nations speech last september 
bush proposed that both countries cut their arsenals of chemical 
weapons to 20 percent of the current us inventory while a 
40nation treaty is worked out requiring us and soviet cuts to 2 
percent of the current us level in eight years that 2 percent 
would be destroyed within 10 years if all countries capable of 
building such weapons agreed to a total ban 
bush in his state of the union address called for troop limits 
of 195000 each for the united states and the soviet union on the 
central front for the united states basically west germany 
with the united states allowed to retain 30000 soldiers elsewhere 
on the continent 
gorbachev proposed applying the 195000 limit to all of europe 
thus cutting the us advantage 
alternatively gorbachev proposed a ceiling of 225000 
throughout europe since most soviet troops are in central europe 
the total there could be boosted to 225000 
baker said the idea of a 195000 limit for all of europe was 
very close to the presidents proposal but he said he would 
consult the us allies in the north atlantic treaty organization 
before responding formally 
he is to meet with the 15 foreign ministers at a conference in 
ottawa canada next monday and tuesday officials from the seven 
warsaw pact nations will be on hand as well to consider open 
skies and other measures designed to reduce eastwest tensions 
while virtually all soviet soldiers on the continent are 
stationed in the central region of poland east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary the united states has forces in 
britain greece italy spain and turkey 
baker said the soviets dont want to deal with central europe 
as such and he said the united states obviously is not 
wedded to the concept of linkage 
baker winds up his visit here on saturday with an unprecedented 
appearance before the international affairs committee of the 
supreme soviet the soviet parliament 
he will then fly to sofia bulgaria and on sunday to bucharest 
romania the two east european allies of moscow are in the midst of 
rocky transitions from hardline communism 
baker will meet with opposition leaders as well as government 
officials in those countries the state department said 
while the issue of troops drew most of the attention baker and 
the soviets made headway on a number of other fronts and clashed 
over cuba 
baker confirmed reports the soviets are in the process of 
providing mig fighterbombers to cuba but evidently was unable to 
persuade the soviets to relent 
on afghanistan he said the united states was willing to permit 
president najib to remain in office while peace negotiations are 
conducted between the sovietbacked government and usarmed 
guerrillas 
but baker said najib would have to step down once an agreement 
was reached to end the 11year war in the southwest asian country 
on another regional front baker criticized israel for settling 
some soviet jewish immigrants on the west bank and in gaza he said 
the settlements were an obstacle to peace 
however baker said that since israel is a strong ally of 
the united states he had rejected a soviet proposal to join in 
condemning the settlement of the jewish refugees they amount to 
about 1 percent to 2 percent of the jewish exodus to israel from 
the soviet union 
gennady i gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
said thursday night the two sides were likely to adopt such a 
public stance together 
on several arms control fronts baker also reported progress 
he said the issues of revealing missile test data in flight to 
the other side and where to store nondeployed missiles were 
settled and baker said a third complex issue how many 
airlaunched cruise missiles could be carried on bombers was 
settled except for questions about their range 
these were the three complex issues bush and gorbachev at their 
malta summit meeting in december had turned over to baker and 
shevardnadze for resolution 
they are part of the negotiations on a treaty to slash 
longrange us and soviet nuclear missiles bombers and submarines 
that bush and gorbachev would like to sign at their summit meeting 
in washington in june 
an even more ticklish issues what to do about sealaunched 
cruise missiles apparently will be finessed with a statement 
outside the treaty itself stating each sides policy 
baker said he did not think the declaratory statement would be 
submitted to the us senate for ratification along with the treaty 
what to do about the missiles which are carried on submarines 
and surface ships has been the most difficult problem in the 
treatys path 
the soviet news agency tass said gorbachev told baker that new 
us proposals make it possible to bring the positions closer on 
several items and inspire hope that the program of preparations for 
the summit in washington will be successfully implemented

public schools closed three days by protests 
over white management of the citys mostly black school system 
will reopen monday officials said thursday 
the demonstrations continued in this 1960s battleground of the 
civil rights movement as about 250 people crowded into city hall 
to protest the alleged sexual abuse of a protest leader when she 
was arrested earlier in the week 
the protesers promised to stay in city hall until the police 
officer involved is suspended about 45 people remained there 
thursday night as city council members met to seek a resolution of 
the situation 
school officials announced that all 11 public schools would 
remain closed friday schools superintendent norward roussell said 
later that the schools would reopen monday 
rising racial tensions forced the closing of two schools tuesday 
morning all schools in the 70 percent black 6000 student system 
closed that afternoon and remained shut wednesday and thursday 
the six white members on the 11member board dismissed roussell 
last week but reinstatated him tuesday and he returned to work 
wednesday 
white board members voted in december against renewing his 
80000ayear contract it expires in june prompting the five 
blacks on the board to announce their resignations 
roussell and his supporters claim the board was terminating his 
contact because he is black rather than because of his alleged 
lack of managerial skills as claimed by his critics 
the latest protests were over the arrest monday of rose sanders 
in a melee at city hall 
mrs sanders claims a policeman touched her private parts with 
his billy club as she was dragged to police headquarters she was 
released from the hospital thursday 
the wife of state sen hank sanders who was hospitalized monday 
with injuries she said she received at the hands of police was 
released from the hospital thursday 
sanders and a law partner of his met thursday with mayor joe 
smitherman who said the matter was under investigation and a 
report is expected friday 
smitherman said the policeman ronnie rushing has been given 
office duty the mayor said earlier that rushing was injured by 
mrs sanders when she forced police to remove her from city hall 
he said rose bit him and he had to have medical treatment 
smitherman said i dont believe it at all when she said she was 
mistreated 
i know rose sanders would not say anything if it did not 
happen said one of the protesters the rev ll ruffin nor 
do i believe she instigated it

subway panhandlers aging rock stars 
bluecollar punks rappers ruthless lawyers selfsatisfied 
doctors street crazies drug heads 
eric bogosian hears america singing and the song is one of 
excess and how people handle it 
his blistering portraits come to life in sex drugs rock amp 
roll a terrific collection of monologues that bogosian unleashed 
thursday at offbroadways orpheum theater 
the dark frizzyhaired performer has done oneman shows before 
specifically funhouse and drinking in america but in his 
latest effort bogosian captures even more successfully the 
schizophrenic nature of his characters lives 
nightmarish and comic at the same time they sum up the late 
notsolamented 1980s as the decade of greed and preoccupation with 
self 
even bogosians bums have an ego im a product of my 
environment snarls an aggressive subway beggar i want your 
money 
some of the material is savagely funny particularly a geriatric 
pop idol who now that he has made his dough has discovered the 
evils of dope the risks of sex and the plight of the amazon rain 
forest 
or theres bogosians almost slapstick picture of a lowerclass 
italian kid who takes a good friend out on a bender the night 
before his wedding an escapade that results in the trashing of a 
mcdonalds and a postponement of the ceremony 
theres a chilling effect to the evening too especially in the 
final almost scary monologue where a stoned young man talks about 
computers taking over the world these machines are going to get 
you one way or another he warns and you believe him no matter 
how high he is 
a tough social critic bogosian has a kind of weird affection 
for these misfits he understands them 
bogosian also has become a better actor since his last new york 
appearance for example director jo bonney has coaxed out of him 
an acerbic portrayal of a nasty combative lawyer who is as 
hilarious as he is frightening the man keeps repeating sue me 
so often that it begins to sound like a religious chant 
a lot of bogosians monologues have a rhythm an almost musical 
quality to them the language flows whether it is street talk or 
highfinance legalese 
bogosian is a physical as well as verbal performer he paces and 
prowls the small spare stage in his swagger struts shuffles and 
pacings you get a sense of the fierce energy these characters 
invest in pursuing both pleasure and pain 
the evening goes on a little too long and might work better if 
there were an intermission sex drugs rock amp roll is such a 
densely packed work that by the time its over the audience is 
exhausted from both laughing at and worrying about the 
memorable people bogosian has put on stage

criminologists and other experts tell them 
otherwise but many norwegians are convinced their country is 
overrun by thugs hooligans and the mob 
the experts say the public concern verges on national 
hysteria they argue that norway still has one of the worlds 
lowest crime rates and is nowhere near being in a league with the 
united states or other countries with serious crime problems 
our biggest crime problem is the unfounded anxiety people feel 
about it said nils christie a university of oslo criminology 
professor 
muggings are rare and city parks generally are safe some 
cafeterias leave it up to the customers to leave what they owe in a 
till and even make their own change 
few of norways 42 million people have actually witnessed 
criminal violence according to an informal poll by one newspaper 
police who usually are unarmed used or threatened to use 
weapons just 28 times last year according to justice ministry 
figures 
norway is at the bottom of the list of violent crimes per 
capita said christie the risk of being murdered in the united 
states is nine times greater than in norway according to a local 
study 
sociologist cecilie hoigaard listed norways murder rate in 1988 
as 09 killings per 100000 residents compared to 14 in sweden 
and 51 in france the world almanac said the us figure was 83 
the same year 
yet crime in norway has increased by about 15 percent a year 
since 1986 according to official figures and thats what has 
brought all the repercussions 
we arent interested in comparing ourselves to other 
countries said tor aksel busch deputy director general of 
public prosecutions we must compare ourselves to the way things 
were it is the increase that is disturbing 
crimes for monetary or material gain such as theft and fraud 
represent 81 percent of the offenses 
there is simply much more to steal because norways standard 
of living has increased enormously criminologist christie said 
norway had an economic boom when it discovered oil off its coast 
from 1986 to 1988 drug arrests doubled and violent crime rose 
29 percent partly because alcohol is more accepted by 
traditionally reserved and pious norwegians christie said 
we norwegians are very worried about crime said kjell solem 
of the justice ministry it is a frequent topic of debate we 
started with very little and dont like the increase 
norway has an oldfashioned crime rate he added you have 
to go back 25 years to find such a low rate in sweden it is safe 
almost anywhere any time in norway 
in december robbers rammed a large truck into an armored car 
and escaped with about 1 million leaving a trail of burning 
getaway cars norwegians could perhaps understand the greed but 
were appalled that the thieves were prepared to harm the security 
guards by ramming the armored car with the truck 
people speak of moral decay the fraying of societys 
fabric solem said 
crime was a major issue in last autumns national election 
everything from drugs and alcohol to video tapes and foreigners 
came in for the blame the rightwing party of progress increased 
its standing in parliament tenfold partly on the basis of a 
lawandorder campaign 
crime has become a matter of national hysterics said 
sociologist thomas mathiesen there is a much greater fear of 
crime than there is any grounds for 
many norwegians are responding by fortifying their homes lock 
sales soared 60 percent from 1987 to 1989 and burglar alarm sales 
are said to be on the rise 
mathiesen said fear was being spread unwittingly by the news 
media politicians and even police who seek larger budgets 
tabloid newspapers routinely brand any group of criminals the 
mafia they devote sensational and lengthy coverage to murders 
and pursue the cases for weeks 
the respected aftenposten newspaper in a review of the 1980s 
said more crime produced more crime reporting in the 1970s 
trivial crimes were reported it wrote now its hard to find 
space for all the corruption theft and violence

established two years later are based in munich but controlled by 
the washingtonbased bureau of international broadcasting and 
funded by the us congress it is popularly known as rferl 
rferl was distinct from the voice of america the british 
broadcasting corp and other western radios because it was a 
surrogate for free media that did not exist in eastern europe 
said robert e gillette the deputy director 
rfe broadcasts to bulgaria czechoslovakia hungary poland and 
romania as well as the lithuania latvia and estonia radio 
liberty broadcasts to the soviet union in 12 languages 
gillette and a ross johnson a director say they believe rfe 
was a powerful catalyst in the revolutions that have swept eastern 
europe 
it not only broadcast international news but news from inside 
the countries to which it beamed its programs people got news of 
home from abroad 
but now after the revolutions rferl is hearing increasingly 
from people who ask for practical advice on democracy and the 
freemarket economy the radios officials say 
setting an example of western journalistic ethics is another 
role rfe sees as vital in the establishment of democracy in eastern 
europe 
it wont be a short or easy process to have a pluralistic 
media johnson said it is relatively easy to close down the 
censors office and get the communist party out of the media but 
it is not so easy to change a generation of habits 
the best way to teach western journalistic ethics is by 
example but it will take some years said gillette a former 
correspondent for the los angeles times 
but the broader role is to answer the countless questions people 
have about democracy and western economics 
they dont know much about democratic institutions how to go 
about establishing them marsh said they are trying to learn 
about the democratic process 
we get specific requests on the practice of democracy 
johnson said 
people want to know how parliaments and courts work in the west 
how political parties are financed what entrepreneurs do even how 
to clean up the environment 
we are trying to provide that kind of practical information 
johnson said in a sense lessons in democracy 
what happens when that job is done 
in an ideal world if there were no need for us we would be 
very happy to close our doors marsh said but that doesnt 
exist yet 
said gillette history has been on fastforward but that 
doesnt mean there cant be a reversal there are lots of 
alternatives to democracy its not done yet

mountain stage appalachias radio 
answer to a prairie home companion is hitting its stride as a 
showcase for new and avantgarde folk blues bluegrass country 
and even rock music 
now were to the point in the world of music that a lot of 
people know about us i dont think were in our prime yet said 
larry groce host and coproducer 
the twohour weekly show broadcast on nearly 150 american 
public radio stations brings eager artists before appreciative 
crowds in a historic downtown theater every sunday afternoon 
between them stand live microphones 
theres a lot of uncertainty in this thing groce said 
every show is like writing a song its not art without 
uncertainty 
coproducer andy ridenour saw a dearth of live radio shows when 
he created mountain stage for west virginia public radio in 
1981 
the idea is not a novel one he said the contemporary 
presentation is unique theres no one else doing what were 
doing 
mountain stage went into regular production in 1984 and was 
first distributed nationally by national public radio in 1986 the 
show switched to apr last october it is often compared to a 
prairie home companion garrison keillors celebrated live public 
radio variety show 
mountain stage producers say they admire keillors show but 
emphasize they didnt jump on the minnesota shows bandwagon for 
one thing they say mountain stage emphasizes music over talk 
and moves quickly between acts 
a typical show broadcast live in west virginia and rebroadcast 
on a tape delay elsewhere usually offers three acts and the 
everpresent groce backed by the house band and the fabulous 
twister sisters 
groce 41 is a singer and songwriter from dallas whose junk 
food junkie was a 1976 hit his smooth tones and gentle manner 
now probably come across best when he sings a traditional hymn on 
every mountain stage 
the band which includes twister sisters deni bonett and julie 
adams on fiddle and guitar is making its own name as stark raven 
mountain stage often features regional acts from texas and 
cajun country and such international acts as latin american 
african and irish folk singers 
ridenour 40 a former radio newsman was not met with 
enthusiasm when he created the show groce said even npr 
poohpoohed the show 
people spent a lot of time telling us what we couldnt do 
ridenour said we were told the show would never work that 
we couldnt do a show like this in charleston wva npr said there 
was a maximum of 60 stations that would ever use mountain stage 
 
funding for the show hasnt grown as rapidly as its popularity 
the producers manage up to 40 broadcasts on about 500000 a year 
about onethird the amount similar radio shows receive ridenour 
said the money buys a small staff and musicians stipends for the 
artists rental of the auditorium and a little promotion 
stations now get the show through their apr fees but west 
virginia public radio will be paid directly beginning in july 
ridenour said 
a la carte public radio is becoming a trend as funding 
becomes more difficult and stations pick and choose which shows 
they want groce said 
the reality is that it costs money to make this programming 
and if youre going to take it youre going to have to start 
paying money he said 
mountain stage is fast becoming a key stop for rising 
musicians as agents and record companies realize the shows 
popularity artists too are enthusiastic and show their 
appreciation by signing the walls in the basement of the capitol 
plaza music hall downtown 
i was west virginia when west virginia wasnt cool wrote 
country singer kathy mattea a charlestonarea native who performed 
in december after being named the country music associations 
female vocalist of the year 
pop songwriter livingston taylor younger brother of the singer 
james taylor was recently greeted like an old friend ive been 
here lots of times he said theyre a really comfortable crew 
to work with 
taylors enthusiasm came through when he modified the final 
stanza of you are my sunshine in the finale singing on 
super sunday i flew to charleston my loneliness to assuage at 
long last i have contentment with my pards on mountain stage 
 
robin williams the traditional folk musician not the comedian 
said hes been on mountain stage four times to work with 
great musicians in a great atmosphere he also likes the 
exposure and the chance to do new songs instead of old hits

eighteen years after it was made a clockwork 
orange still cannot be seen on british screens but it is about 
to find a new home on stage 
set in the next century and featuring music by members of the u2 
rock band the royal shakespeare companys version extensively 
reworks a script by anthony burgess author of the 1962 novel 
a clockwork orange remains bestknown for stanley kubricks 
controversial 1971 film starring malcolm mcdowell as the marauding 
alex a 15yearold briton drunk on the joys of violence 
the film was nominated for several top academy awards but was 
also denounced for supposedly extending the frontiers of screen 
violence in 1972 kubrick withdrew it from british circulation 
because he was receiving death threats 
written in nadsat an anglorussian slang invented by 
burgess the novel and film were about alexs love of violence and 
beethoven and the doctors who destroy both passions by meddling 
with his brain 
burgess wrote the stage script simply to deter others from doing 
it but lately he has taken to deriding his most famous novel 
its a terrible book in some ways im not prepared to defend 
it burgess told the independent newspaper 
but the plays director ron daniels disagrees he calls the 
novel a brilliant piece of work and he believes the stage show 
will be complex and interesting and vivid and at times funny 
a clockwork orange 2004 as the playwithmusic is now 
called opened feb 6 at the rscs barbican theater in london 
running in repertory through march 13 
its very much a morality play for the 90s daniels said 
during a rare afternoon off from rehearsals as many of his cast 
are appearing in his concurrent rsc hamlet 
nowadays after pictures of vietnam after punk after video 
nasties after all those appalling images of violence the way i 
hope we will assess the novella will be not so much as a play about 
violence but as a play about right and wrong he said 
alex leader of the socalled droogs who get their kicks 
beating and raping others is the malefactor as hero a 
modernday richard iii daniels said 
its amazing how attractive the character is daniels said 
hes someone free from all sense of guilt he says im 
celebrating myself 
the stage version restores the original ending of burgess novel 
which was excised in both the american edition of the novel and in 
kubricks film 
what happens is alex goes back into the wide world now hes 
18 but hes no longer enjoying the ultraviolence no longer 
enjoying the gang society daniels said 
hes becoming a much more stable citizen but at the same time 
we miss his creative energy hes the brightest and the best 
burgess script includes musical numbers to beethoven melodies 
phil daniels a 31yearold londoner and no relation of the 
director plays alex the show features some beethoven while 
adding a contemporary sound provided by bono and the edge two 
members of u2 
i phoned up their manager and said im going to be doing 
this would they be at all interested ron daniels recalled 
ironically they had just been in los angeles where they were 
struck by the gang identity and violence 
had i wanted abrasive music i would have gone to a hard rock 
group this music is immensely evocative and haunting other 
moments have a very here and now sound 
while a clockwork orange is not daniels emphasizes a 
musical its choreography by arlene phillips starlight 
express involves knives and chains not highstepping chorus 
lines 
the fact is we have a boy who is enjoying evil he said 
he added that the play has a moral and a social context its 
about people who have no stake in society the discarded the 
marginals 
to those who wonder whether its a suitable project for the 
royal shakespeare company daniels replies this is precisely the 
sort of frontline theater the rsc needs to be doing it does 
what i think theater must do it disturbs it unsettles it makes 
you think new thoughts

early in black stars in orbit on pbs 
tonight a former air force pilot nominated in 1963 to be the 
first black astronaut discusses what he says was the racial 
prejudice that kept him from that achievement 
president john f kennedy had prodded him to apply for the space 
program says edward j dwight jr and there were rumors that he 
had this dream of having a black or an oriental on the 
nations first mission to the moon 
dwight never became an astronaut the reason he says his 
bitterness muted but still there was racial prejudice 
particularly by a white senior officer at the air force test pilot 
school to which dwight had been assigned 
youll wish that this otherwise excellent orbit had done 
more in the segment had identified the officer dwight doesnt 
name and listened to his side of the story 
it might have shown that even with dwights accusations of 
bigotry perhaps a bit more was involved the program produced by 
filmmaker william miles should at least have raised more questions 
but this onehour documentary about americas black astronauts 
and the blacks who worked behind the scenes in the nations space 
program still is well worth viewing 
it lets them tell of their dreams and the obstacles they faced 
and amply shows their determination to succeed in what for years 
had been an allwhite allmale preserve 
the program profiles six black astronauts including the late 
dr ronald e mcnair one of the challenger crew members killed 
when the spacecraft exploded in january 1986 
others on the program include dr mae c jemison who will make 
her first space flight next year and air force col guinon s 
bluford who in 1983 became the first black to travel in space 
orbit also shows sparingly the outright racism that 
existed the ugliest example a letter once sent the widow of air 
force maj robert h lawrence jr the first black pilot selected 
for astronaut duty 
sympathy cards poured in she says after he was killed in the 
mid60s when the ejection seat of his f104 fighter malfunctioned 
just before the plane crashed 
but the mail also brought hate one writer she recalls said he 
was glad her husband was killed because now there would be no 
coons on the moon 
in a long but interesting segment actress nichelle nichols lt 
uhura of star trek speaks about how she agreed to use her tv 
fame to help the nations space program recruit minorities and 
women 
but perhaps the programs best moments come when individuals 
simply are allowed to talk about what they do or about their 
experiences in space if theyve been there without a big deal 
being made about what first they accomplished 
its good that viewers particularly young ones know what 
blacks have faced in the space program and prior to that such as 
their struggle to fly combat missions in the racially segregated 
military of world war ii 
but sometimes its just as helpful to just listen to someone 
like marine col charles f bolden jr who flew the space shuttle 
columbia in 1986 talk about the space program or his memories of 
mcnair 
hes articulate and obviously loves his work he shows that 
todays right stuff cadre has no color only desire courage 
education and ability

americans have seen how efficiently the japanese 
make and deliver cameras television sets electronic accessories 
and automobiles 
soon they may witness that same efficiency in the grocery store 
already the japanese have perfected their techniques at home now 
they are preparing to move into the american market 
acquisition and aggressive market entry is only a matter of 
time says bill best of at kearney a consulting firm that has 
just completed two studies of what is likely to become a 
controversial situation 
already says best who heads the companys tokyo office many 
japanese food companies have set up at least an outpost in the 
united states and he predicts the matter will become a major 
issue in the next five years 
the battle could be bitter and controversial too because the 
japanese have developed advantages over american counterparts in 
the efficiency of food delivery a critical factor in the highly 
competitive food business 
even now competition for space in foodstores is intense with 
some outlets earning less than a penny a dollar stores cannot 
afford empty shelf space and even brandname products can be 
removed because of tardy deliveries 
in japan says best it takes japanese food manufacturers less 
than a day to deliver to their customers while a similar study in 
the united states showed food producers took 77 days from 
processing to delivery 
while travel time conceivably could be a factor in the japanese 
advantage other factors seemingly play a far greater role among 
them best cites three 
1 japanese manufacturers focus entirely on service 
coordinating closely with customers to meet their daytoday needs 
2 pointofsale data systems are much more accurate than us 
systems 
3 the japanese have more flexibile delivery conditions for 
small lots often using window distributors or thirdparty 
contractors for actual delivery 
while the japanese view the american market as an opportunity 
domestic factors also influence their attitudes market growth in 
japan has slowed says best because calorie intake has leveled off 
and population growth is slow 
while this situation has existed for a while japanese food 
companies feared entering the us market says best because they 
were unsure of ability to adapt to american tastes 
he says that fear is receding as japanese companies acquire 
interests in us companies such as del monte already active in 
the united states are scores of brandname firms such as nissin 
noodles house spices asahi beer ajinomoto the biggest food 
company in japan and kikkoman soy sauce 
the efficiency of the japanese could present a critical 
challenge to american food manufacturers especially if retailers 
seek to lower inventories historically a large expense in favor 
of justintime delivery 
it wouldnt be a first accustomed to warehousing large 
inventories of components american automakers quickly shifted to 
justintime deliveries when they discovered them to be a major 
factor in japanese price competition 
best lists these implications for the us marketplace 
1 american grocery products companies will need to respond to 
customers with faster more reliable service 
2 distribution strategy will become more important in customer 
relations 
3 reliable current market information data on sales and 
inventories for example will be essential to providing better 
service with less inventory

stocks of wall streets big brokerages are 
dancing the limbo the question is how low can they go 
not much lower say securities analysts who think brokerage 
stocks already may have bumped the bar with their bellies 
bottoming out after a pathetic showing in 1989 
one sign of apathy was troubled shearson lehman hutton incs 
decision last month to scrap a sale of 20 million shares of common 
stock shearsons own brokers were said to balk at selling the 
issue 
in a typically gloomy assessment analyst lawrence eckenfelder 
of prudential bache securities inc said the securities business 
remains sluggish and investors pessimistic about brokerage firms 
performance in 1990 
eckenfelder said it will take at least six to 12 months to 
evaluate securities stock buys made at current depressed levels 
because the market seems poised to take a waitandsee attitude 
and earnings for the march quarter are not expected to improve 
significantly 
while a revival isnt imminent that doesnt mean stocks of 
major firms will fall further shearson brokerage analyst dean 
eberling said stocks of fullline investment firms fell 21 percent 
in 1989 compared with a 106 percent rise in the standard amp poors 
500 index and 27 percent jump in the dow jones industrial average 
this may mark the bottom of the cycle eberling said i 
cant say its going to turn around tomorrow night but 
securities stocks may improve over the long term he said 
just how long that term will be no one knows unless crucial 
wall street businesses such as investment banking and retail 
brokerage both in the doldrums pick up the consensus is at 
least a year 
how bad has it been shares of shearson beset by internal 
management turmoil hit an alltime low of 1012 late last month 
down 44 percent from the start of 1989 and more than 70 percent 
from its public offering in 1987 
stock in the nations largest brokerage merrill lynch amp co 
has lost more than 25 percent in the last year salomon inc is off 
about 20 percent even though it reported a 1989 profit of 470 
million the best on wall street though much of that came from the 
firms oilrefining and trading businesses 
wall street firms have been grumpy since the october 1987 market 
crash washed away the giddy prosperity of megamergers and buoyant 
stock market activity 
after tanking in the crash brokerage stocks idled through 1988 
individual investors cautiously returned to the market in mid1989 
investment firms turned in strong second and thirdquarter profits 
and their stocks responded 
but hopes of a lasting revival were wiped out when the dow 
average plunged 190 points on oct 13 brokerage commissions are 
down and investment banking activity has all but dried up along 
with the junkbond financing market a double whammy for wall 
street firms 
now we have a soft retail environment and a very weak 
investment banking environment eberling said those two have 
come together to create a very tough operating environment 
not all firms have performed badly analysts recommend stocks 
such as the st louisbased retail brokerage ag edwards inc 
whose shares have risen since the start of 1989 discount brokerage 
charles schwab amp co has more than doubled in the same period 
analysts point to low overhead and wellmanaged costs at those 
firms 
of the large publicly traded firms only morgan stanley amp co 
and bear stearns amp co are getting high marks for similar 
reasons specialization and controlled costs 
analysts laud morgans domestic and international investment 
banking business the company also is buying back its own stock a 
good sign for investors analysts said bear stearns wins for 
consistent earnings and a successful stock clearinghouse operation 
regional brokerages could do better because of less 
susceptibility to the junkbond market mess that has crippled big 
takeover deals industry executives said 
the middlemarket deals those of 250 million and less are 
continuing to get done because they are much less dependent on 
public offerings of subordinated debt that is on junk bonds 
lloyd greif vice chairman of the san franciscobased investment 
firm sutro amp co said at a conference of regional brokerages 
earlier this month 
but securities industry analysts caution that investors 
shouldnt expect instant profits from brokerage firms wall street 
is in a recession and there are no indications it will end soon 
the message beware of bulls 
the brokerage industry is characterized by its optimism and 
enthusiasm said analyst john keefe of drexel burnham lambert 
inc theres a tendency on the part of management to think the 
next market turn is just around the corner

a minor executive of an immensely powerful japanese 
bank invites you for a nightcap at his bar where pretty young 
women in leather miniskirts pour your whiskey 
three hours later the banker takes care of the 620 tab by 
handing the cashier a business card as you walk into the neon 
glare of tokyos ginza you wonder how the home office will react 
when you try to return the hospitality 
welcome to the moderate end of business entertainment in japan 
dinner for four at a swank ryotei restaurant where geisha 
entertain with mournful ballads and witty stories while diners 
feast on prawns so fresh they wriggle on the plate can cost 
6900 
yet many japanese companies expect their executives to entertain 
clients several nights a week at such restaurants and hostess bars 
in 1989 the cost of entertaining climbed 87 percent to a 
record 31 billion says the national tax administration 
surpassing the 29 billion budgeted for japans defense 
the rise occurred despite a call from the keidanren a leading 
business group for restraint in the aftermath of the notorious 
recruit affair a scandal over alleged bribery of numerous 
politicians bureaucrats and businessmen 
the money is spent not so much on closing deals as on building 
close relationships 
without liquor japanese cant be frank said kazutaka 
nakamura an accountant who has crunched the numbers on expense 
accounts its a national characteristic 
for small companies entertainment expenses can make up 20 
percent to 30 percent of project costs he said 
the practice can hobble a foreign enterprise in japan 
robert j collins president of the american club in japan and 
author of the satiric novel max danger the adventures of an 
expat in tokyo cites golf as evidence 
if a guy is really laying it on golf can easily run to 
half a million yen 3500 
laying it on may include sending a limousine or even a 
helicopter for the guest and providing luxury accommodations by the 
green he said 
even a nofrills golf excursion during the weekdays costs 
about 1000 said collins who has been an insurance executive and 
head hunter during his 12 years in japan 
expense is not the only burden 
with traffic jams snarling tokyo highways every weekend you 
go out there the night before stay up late drinking get up at 
dawn and go out in the rain and play all day long 
then you drive four hours back to tokyo and never once has 
anyone said a word about business 
collins said the object is to endure an ordeal together 
afterwards he said i can get on the phone to a company 
chairman and hell come out of a meeting to talk to his golfing 
buddy 
afterhours entertainment follows tediously predictable 
patterns collins said mutual appreciation over dinner then 
some gossip then you move onto a hostess bar theres a 
karaoke singalong machine and four or five girls 
for hours you sing and drink names get shortened 
finally he said you go home sick and show up the next day at 
work complaining god i had to stay out til three in the 
morning 
the effort can create a bond stronger than any contract 
though a company may have to absorb losses for a few years in hopes 
of longterm profits 
spending into the red on entertainment is hard to explain to 
management or shareholders overseas but it is a way to enter 
japans tightly knit business circles and help find a market for an 
import 
as wives are never included in such activities the family life 
of western businessmen suffers 
for women inside japans corporate world business entertainment 
often means pouring tea during the day and whiskey after hours 
anastasia morgan 23 of seattle left a japanese advertising 
firm recently after finding her position as an assistant account 
executive was short on substance and long on entertainment 
she accepted serving tea to visitors as part of the job but 
found that accompanying guests to hostess bars galled her 
while young hostesses flirted with the men ms morgan was 
expected to make pleasant conversation 
there was a little bit of hankypanky involved she said 
it was done in good taste but you could sense the lust around 
you as a woman i didnt want to see that 
she went along with it for a year and a half because i came 
to learn from japan not to change it pausing she added i 
learned to deal with leches 
sometimes the lechery becomes a commercial transaction 
one japanese businessman speaking on condition of anonymity 
admitted he had been offered sex with a prostitute as a business 
gift 
tapping his wedding ring he said it happens but we dont 
talk about it 
for most businessmen however entertainment means a numbing 
cycle of meals drinks and golf 
takehiko yamaguchi formerly an executive of marubeni corp 
says that while in the trading houses steel export division he 
found it a bit tough to entertain two or three times a week 
yamaguchi now a senior analyst at the japan institute for 
social and economic affairs added japanese businessmen are not 
so very pleased to entertain every night but it is traditional 
it will not change in the near future

the history of salmonfishing in the 
stormy north pacific is filled with tales of brave fishermen riding 
the wild seas but its future is being shaped in calmer waters 
thousands of salmon in this sheltered arm of puget sound are 
captives in sunken pens the size of basketball courts crowded fin 
to fin they swim endless laps gobbling feed pellets and being 
fattened toward the day theyll be scooped up and whisked to market 
yet while the crenulated coastline and pristine waters that 
stretch from washingtons puget sound to southeastern alaska might 
be ideal for fish farming the political climate is not so 
welcoming 
in alaska where commercial fishermen are a powerful lobby 
bumper stickers in fishing towns proclaim real fish dont eat 
pellets and the legislature is considering a permanent ban on 
fish farms when a twoyear moratorium expires in july 
in washington state salmon farmers have the official blessing 
of the legislature but that has helped little in the face of 
challenges from fishermen and environmental groups which have 
defeated several proposed farms 
the fish waste produced by a twoacre salmon farm is equivalent 
to the sewage produced by a town of 5000 people claims a 
washington citizens group called the marine environmental 
consortium 
environmentalists also fear introduced species such as atlantic 
salmon favored because they fetch a higher price and are more 
docile than pacific salmon will corrupt the local gene pool and 
spread disease wealthy owners of shoreside homes meanwhile dont 
want fish farms spoiling their views 
promoters call fish farming an efficient way to help meet the 
worlds growing appetite for fish not only does it provide a 
yearround supply of fresh salmon to supplement the seasonal wild 
catch they say it also creates jobs free of the hazards of 
commercial fishing one of the nations most dangerous occupations 
they also contend salmonfarming provides an economic incentive 
to preserve clean water 
were the best environmentalists of all because were 
dependent on it said jerry polley site manager for global aqua 
the nations largest salmon farm if somethings wrong with the 
water quality were going to be the first to complain 
production of farmed salmon here and abroad has boomed in five 
years flooding markets traditionally held by wild salmon and 
driving down prices 
for the first couple of years as more salmon was around on a 
yearround basis the farmed fish seemed to help the wild market 
said commercial fisherman randy babich now its a battle at the 
retail counter 
fish farming or aquaculture is hardly a new concept for 
years farmers have raised oysters in the northwest rainbow trout 
in idaho and catfish in the southeast but techniques have 
developed more slowly in domesticating salmon the mainstay of 
fisheries off oregon washington british columbia and alaska 
for years it was practiced only by the norwegians forced into 
salmon farming by their declining wild fish populations but 
interest has spread quickly since 1985 after norway refined 
methods to raise salmon cheaply enough to compete with the wild 
catch 
in 1983 world production of farmed salmon was 23500 metric 
tons just 3 percent of the 670000ton wild salmon catch by last 
year farmed salmon production had soared to an estimated 202000 
tons or 30 percent of the relatively constant wild catch 
norway still leads the pack producing about 75 percent of the 
worlds farmed salmon but other places including scotland chile 
canada and iceland are catching up the united states with 50 
fish farms in washington state and maine lags far behind 
producing 1 percent of the total 
many of the us salmon farms are run by norwegian companies 
including global aquas fouracre operation in rich passage 10 
miles west of seattle 
global aquas farm is fairly typical a huge raft anchored 
offshore holds 40 pens each lined with a net holding up to 15 tons 
of fish which range from fingersize smolts to fatbellied salmon 
2 feet long 
a halfdozen workers tend the pens from metal walkways filling 
automatic feeders and mending nets at harvest workers herd fish 
into one end of the pens scoop them out with an oversize dipnet 
and load them onto a boat the salmon are still kicking when they 
reach a seattle processing plant 30 minutes away 
in the three years it takes to raise salmon to harvest farmers 
contend with prowling otters hungry sea lions and diseases that 
can wipe out whole farms if left unchecked 
aquaculturists say their operations will never be a major blot 
on the coastline 
it would take just 40 acres of farms to produce all of the 
salmon that was imported into the united states in 1988 said 
chris gibson of sea farm washington in port angeles the industry 
does not need a lot of space 
it may need even less space in coming months worldwide growth 
of salmon farming and recent overproduction in norway have glutted 
the market with fish prices have plunged and many farms are 
selling below cost just to keep cash flowing 
in british columbia lax regulation and a surge of norwegian 
investment capital helped the number of fish farms soar from five 
to 135 in the last six years but now many are in trouble nineteen 
have filed for receivership in the past year and small businesses 
are being bought out by large investors better able to outlast the 
lull in prices 
aquaculture boosters profess confidence in their longterm place 
in the salmon trade 
declining stocks of wild salmon already have forced northwest 
fishermen to rely more heavily on fish that are started in 
shoreside hatcheries and released to sea about 23 percent of 
alaskas wild catch now comes from hatcheries while some 
salmon populations off washingtons coast are 60 percent 
hatcheryreared 
were not going to reestablish the wild resource you just 
dont have the habitat for them to come back to said john pitts 
who promotes aquaculture for the washington department of 
agriculture future generations will become more dependent on 
aquaculture 
perhaps but as long as any wild salmon remain some 
independentminded fishermen will take their chances on the high 
seas rather than turn in their rain slickers for bags of fish chow 
its the cromagnon in us said randy babich fishing is 
one of the last huntinggathering professions in the world tossing 
feed into a pond just doesnt provide the same adventure

carl gershman whose job is fostering the 
spread of democracy around the world has it easy these days 
democracy is fostering itself 
when gershman wrote the annual report of the organization he 
heads the national endowment for democracy he warned of 
democracys vulnerabilities and of setbacks here and there but 
nothing could hide one triumphant fact 
the central reality of these times he wrote is that 
throughout the world millions of people are striving to establish 
and secure democratic systems based upon peaceful political 
competition the rule of law a free market economy and respect for 
basic human rights 
the endowment created by congress in 1983 at ronald reagans 
suggestion draws its money from the government but is administered 
privately it receives less than 20 million a year small change 
in washington 
it doles out grants as little as a few thousand dollars as 
much as 1 million to solidarity in poland in 1988 to bolster 
democracy where it is tender or to support independent groups in 
closed societies 
in an interview in his yearend report and in an essay 
gershman offered one experts view of how the worldwide assertion 
of the democratic spirit happened to occur at this time 
he thinks he can pinpoint the crucial place and moment portugal 
in the mid1970s 
at that moment gershman said democracy seemed to be in 
retreat america democracys bastion was experiencing selfdoubt 
the vietnam malaise 
intellectuals argued over whether the united states should 
support rightwing authoritarian regimes if they were opposed to 
leftwing totalitarian regimes a debate which was based upon the 
assumption that the best we could hope for was the lesser evil 
said gershman 
then in portugal the poorest country in western europe 
bloodied by the loss of its overseas colonies a military coup 
overthrew a dicatorship 
in the confusion communists attempted to seize power but the 
people injected themselves into the streets much as they would do 
in 1989 in eastern europe and popular government prevailed a 
republic was proclaimed and a constitution adopted 
next door spains dictator francisco franco a remnant of 
prewar fascism died a similiar struggle resulted in a 
parliamentary monarchy greece too underwent a transition toward 
democracy 
from there the wind swept through latin america ninety percent 
of the regions people lived under authoritarian rule at the start 
of the 1980s now every country in the hemisphere except haiti and 
cuba has some form of democratic government or is planning 
elections 
next of course the democratic bug descended on europe poland 
hungary east germany czechoslvakia romania and within the soviet 
borders themselves 
in asia the uprisings were less successful brutally suppressed 
in china and burma but their occurrence gershman said should 
erase any remaining doubts about the appeal of the democratic idea 
in the nonwestern world 
while gershman does not claim that these events are linked 
that the overthrow of the 18year rule of gen alfredo stroessner 
in paraguay last year somehow precipitated the street uprisings of 
eastern europe he does conclude that they did not occur in 
isolation either 
events have a momentum of their own and no country can be 
shielded from the sweep of historical forces he said 
several historical forces coincided to drive democracy forward 
on a global scale he said among them 
the scientific and technological revolution which rigid 
political systems could not assimilate 
the communications revolution which makes for rising 
expectations 
the tendency toward a world economy which subjects governments 
to the discipline of the market 
the human rights revolution of the 1970s which spread the 
view that all individuals have rights that governments must 
respect 
with that idea fixed you need to find a way in which people 
can live together in peace to negotiate differences without 
violence gershman said 
the alternative to democracy is simply the imposition of 
tyrannical force and that doesnt work very well it produces a 
lot of deaths it doesnt produce economic growth it means one 
group ruling over another and the other resorting to violence 
because theyve been excluded

murdoch magazines a division of rupert 
murdochs news corp ltd plans to make available commercially 
sponsored programming for use in beauty salons starting in june 
it would be the first regularly scheduled video program from 
murdoch magazines and the first video entertainment program aimed 
at reaching clients of beauty salons the company said thursday 
phillip cassidy director of special projects at murdoch 
magazines said his company hopes to sign up at least 3000 beauty 
salons reaching 2 to 25 million women for the launch of the 
service 
but while creating television programs for people getting their 
hair done may be new the concept of trying to reach people in 
unusual settings is not 
a number of media companies have come up with magazines 
sponsored posters and video programs designed to reach patients in 
waiting rooms pet owners at the veterinarians and students at 
school 
in what may be the most controversial commercial video project 
to date whittle communications of knoxville tenn plans to 
launch its channel one daily news show with commercials next month 
in more than 1000 classrooms across the country 
the service has been vilified as an unjustified intrusion on the 
rights of students who are required by law to be in school 
the murdoch magazines project is not likely to cause any such 
uproar 
cassidy said the service called salon network would consist of 
a bimonthly program of 30 to 40 minutes drawing on health 
fashion beauty and other stories that appear in its mirabella new 
woman seventeen premiere and european travel amp life magazines 
he said the programs would be distributed on twohour 
videocassettes to beauty shops that already have their own 
videocasette recorders and television monitors the salons would be 
expected to air the tapes for four hours a day 
a new program would be made available every other month 
each program would contain 7 to 10 minutes of commercials 5 
minutes of which would be sold to advertisers and the remaining 
time used to promote services available at particular salons 
murdoch said its production partner in the venture is teletime 
inc a privatelyowned production company based in great neck 
ny that has previously created programs in beauty shops for 
individual sponsors 
cassidy said he has been presenting the plan to advertisers for 
about a week and plans to begin showing it to beauty salon 
operators next month 
no clients have been signed yet he said the advertising rates 
will be 20000 for a 30second commercial the promotions will be 
run for free 
cassidy said that if the program proves successful murdoch 
magazines would probably begin offering advertisers the chance to 
buy packages that include ad space in magazines and commercial time 
on salon network starting next year

mazda motor corp has entered the already crowded 
fourwheeldrive sportutility vehicle market with a twodoor 
version at a time when other automakers are shifting to fourdoor 
models 
mazda officials said thursday that dealers will begin selling 
the navajo sportutility vehicle this fall it will compete against 
a swelling number of entries from companies hoping to grab part of 
one of the few market segments forecast to grow in the early 1990s 
unlike other companies mazda which calls itself a targeted 
niche marketer will sell only a twodoor vehicle made by ford 
motor co beside its new explorer 
we simply cant afford not to be in this market said clark 
vitulli general manager of mazdas us marketing arm 
the popularity of the fourdoor vehicles has zoomed recently 
with each of the big three and some japanese competitors getting 
into the market most of the fourdoor buyers rarely if ever take 
the vehicles off the road an original selling point for jeeps and 
others 
generally fourdoor sportutility vehicles are seen as 
appealing to families while twodoor versions are more likely to be 
used in the back country 
mazdas navajo the japanese companys first sportutility 
vehicle for us dealers will be built at fords lighttruck 
assembly plant in louisville ky ford began building its explorer 
there monday 
ford officials said about 70 percent of the 200000 or so 
explorers it intends to sell annually will have four doors 
mazda which plans to sell less than 20000 navajos a year is 
banking that families shopping for fourwheeldrive vehicles will 
head to its minivan called the mpv 
we concluded the mpv is a better way to serve this customer 
vitulli said 
sportutility vehicles made up 145 percent of the light truck 
segment last year up tremendously from 1982 when they had just 15 
percent manufacturers and analysts expect sportutility vehicles 
and minivans will gain in popularity while other parts of the total 
vehicle market shrink 
vitulli projected the sportutility vehicle segment alone will 
grow by 24 percent by 1992 
over the past few months ford general motors corp toyota 
motor corp and nissan motor co ltd have introduced fourdoor 
vehicles to compete with fourdoor jeeps the market leader made by 
chrysler corp 
there will be only slight differences between the navajo and the 
explorer mostly in some interior and exterior styling and larger 
bumpers on mazdas version 
prices have not been set for either vehicle 
the sportutility project is the second us vehicle 
manufacturing agreement between ford and mazda ford gets its probe 
cars from mazdas plant in flat rock mich 
mazdas introduction came during a media preview of the chicago 
auto show which opens saturday also on thursday 
ford introduced its 1991 escort gt and mercury tracer cars 
they are the products of an engineering cooperation between mazda 
and ford 
ford said it wants to sell more than 400000 escorts and tracers 
in 1991 escorts will be made in wayne mich and tracers will be 
assembled in hermosillo mexico the government will classify 
tracers as domestic vehicles because more than 75 percent of each 
car is made in the united states 
robert rewey fords vice president for north american sales 
said the company had reduced its newcar inventories into the 60to 
70day range about normal for this time of year gm and chrysler 
plan indefinite plant shutdowns during the next seven weeks which 
will result in thousands of auto workers being laid off 
each of the nations big three automakers shut down assembly 
plants in january for a week or more at a time 
i believe that the inventory correction that we planned was 
essentially completed at the end of january rewey said

bank of new england corps cash crisis apparently 
hasnt abated despite the recent sale of more than 11 billion in 
assets an analyst says 
the federal reserve bank of boston considered the lender of 
last resort for banks reported thursday that it loaned an 
unusually high amount of 723 million to member banks this week 
marcia ryan a bank of new england spokeswoman confirmed that 
the bank borrowed money from the federal reserve she declined to 
give the amount except to say it was slightly above last week 
our borrowing was as we expected it to be she said 
gerard cassidy an analyst with tucker anthony inc said bank 
of new england likely was the prime borrower and he said the 
numbers were particularly troubling because until this week the 
bank appeared to have gained more control over its problems 
two weeks ago the boston fed loaned 478 million and last week 
the figure dropped to 440 million at the same time bank of new 
england has completed asset sales of more than 11 billion 
it means the situation is still bleeding cassidy said 
bank of new england reported last month that its 1989 losses 
should exceed 1 billion largely because of bad real estate loans 
the bank has been trying to sell 6 billion of assets to raise 
cash after watching depositors withdraw millions of dollars 
ryan noted that the bank has not received all the proceeds from 
its recent asset sales though she could not say specifically how 
much money the bank has collected 
in comparison with recent boston fed lending totals the weekly 
figures from middecember to midjanuary ranged from 1 million to 
5 million said herb wass a federal reserve spokesman 
the federal reserve does not identify the institutions borrowing 
the money 
wass stressed that the loans normally are repaid within a day 
and do not accumulate 
earlier in the day it was announced that the bank of tokyo had 
restructured a deal to buy part of bank of new englands leasing 
business after the japanese company became concerned about the 
banks troubles 
under the new agreement bank of new england will sell bank of 
tokyo its bancnewengland leasing group operations and 500 million 
of its lease portfolio and record a profit of 925 million 
the original terms of the agreement announced last november 
would have given bank of new england a 110 million gain 
bank of tokyo expressed concern about bank of new england 
given the publicity the last few weeks said tom lavelle a bank 
spokesman theres been some give and take on both sides 
lavelle noted that under the new agreement bank of tokyo will 
cut by 20 percent the cost to service a 1 billion leasing 
portfolio retained by bank of new england 
the revised terms of the sale do not change the advantages to 
us of the previously announced transaction h ridgely bullock 
the banks interim chairman said in a statement the transaction 
will help improve our capital ratios and will raise in excess of 
500 million in cash 
bullock said he hoped to complete the transaction within the 
next several weeks

a federal judges ruling that just a

victory in its 38 billion takeover attempt 
we are delighted with the courts decision said 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr this is one more 
important advance in bringing georgiapacific closer to completing 
this acquisition which we believe is best for great northern 
shareholders employees and communities in which they operate 
a great northern spokesman declined to predict whether directors 
will be able to survive a march 2 proxy vote in light of us 
district judge gene carters decision which lowered the percentage 
of votes needed to oust the board from threefourths to twothirds 
were disappointed and we certainly are going to study what 
he had to say and then well decide how to react to it great 
northern spokesman stephen m hill said from his office in norwalk 
conn 
carter agreed with atlantabased georgiapacific that the 
threefourths requirement in great northerns bylaws ran afoul of 
maine corporate law the judge also struck down two more portions 
of the companys bylaws that allowed outgoing directors to name a 
new board and called for a 90day nomination period for new 
directors 
great northerns board has been fighting the takeover attempt 
but georgiapacific succeeded in forcing next months special 
shareholders meeting in portland 
georgiapacific contends that great northerns directors are 
resisting the takeover offer so they can hold onto their own 
highpaying jobs at the expense of shareholders 
despite thursdays setback great northern still hopes to 
persuade the judge to block georgiapacifics effort to oust its 
board the judge plans to hear oral arguments monday on that motion 
great northern also hopes to block the hostile tender offer on 
grounds including allegations that georgiapacific has violated 
federal securities laws by covering up plans to sell maine assets 
should the deal go through

an advertising company that uses all the 
tricks of the trade to boost consumer appetites for raw 
agricultural products believes in a fun food fight 
ketchum communications inc leads a growing number of firms 
battling old images to give people a new and at times humorous 
way of thinking about food staples 
prunes for example they shouldnt remind you of something 
youd most likely find at grandmas house ketchum touted them as 
high fiber fruit 
or raisins instead of gobbling them straight from the box 
ketchum advises adding them to citrus juice and dabbing the mixture 
on a slice of salmon for a pink lady 
ketchums campaign pushing beef as real food for real people 
is probably its best known one it used hollywood stars to tell 
consumers that meat can be low calorie and packed with protein 
pittsburghbased ketchum with offices in san francisco and 
several other major cities claims the largest client list of 
commodity boards of any advertising and public relations company in 
the united states 
the agency believes says food producers need new strategies to 
get their goods into the modern kitchen where the microwave is 
king and oldfashioned cooking techniques are becoming obsolete 
american home life has taken to the fast lane ketchum 
spokesman phil siegel says 
with a growing need to do everything quickly longstanding 
traditions like baking are being lost and the marketers of 
certain food staples are now forced to rethink strategies and 
inspire consumers to use traditional products in nontraditional 
ways after all how can baking ingredients like walnuts and 
raisins be sold to a country of nonbakers 
the nations more than 200 commodity boards consist of farmers 
shippers and distributors of food products from salmon to wild 
rice that unite to market their products 
dianne snedaker president of ketchums san francisco ad 
division said the firms commodity business has tripled in the 
last five years and accounted for nearly 200 million of its 750 
million in billings last year the beef industry council ketchums 
largest commodity client has increased its marketing budget 
eightfold since 1981 to 35 million for example 
the growth should slow because the number of boards is limited 
and ketchums contracts with some like the beef council prohibit 
the firm from accepting rival clients like the chicken or pork 
boards still snedaker predicts further growth in billings this 
decade 
i have always considered them the premiere public relations 
agency for food in the united states said robert phinney 
director of the california raisin advisory board 
his group became a household word overnight after its 
advertising agency foote cone amp belding created the california 
dancing raisins in 1985 ketchum later created human models for the 
characters that toured the nation even getting invited to 
president bushs inaugural parade 
ketchum made a concerted effort 20 years ago to be pioneers by 
taking the marketing expertise from the rest of the food industry 
and bringing it to commodity groups said phinney whose board 
was ketchums first commodity client in 1971 
ketchums clients list also includes the california strawberry 
advisory board california prune board the peanut advisory board 
the wisconsin milk marketing board norway sardines the american 
egg board and the national mushroom growers association 
the key to finding a new image for food staples is keeping track 
of how people eat snedaker says company research shows that a 
remarkable number of people eat while standing up 
allen miller executive vice president of ketchums public 
relations division says food marketers find many people have grown 
up with little cooking experience because of the advent of the 
microwaves and fast foods 
youve got to show these people how to quickly and easily make 
a meal out of something you dont necessarily take out of a 
package miller said 
take potatoes ketchum has been trying to boost sales for the 2 
billion american potato crop by calling them the ideal fastfood in 
the age of the microwave 
magazine advertisements tout the vegetables smooth skin and 
luscious curves aerodynamically designed for speed it is 
the perfect alternative to food like pasta one ad stresses 
ketchum has sponsored food preparation demonstrations by cooking 
experts in stores and on television shows to show how to prepare 
potatoes and other food staples in the microwave other than just 
baking 
ketchum also runs a food research center where it experiments 
with new ways for producers to capture greater slices of the 220 
billion annual food service industry 
the center worked on walnuts finely grinding them to invent a 
creamy walnut smear for bakery use it also formulated 
chocolatecovered walnuts that withstand freezing and created a 
walnut additive for ice cream 
by creating american versions of traditional japanese recipes 
ketchum was able to help increase sales of kikkoman soy sauce by 25 
percent during the first year of a marketing program according to 
kaz takei a kikkoman international inc vice president

a federal bankruptcy judge indicated that 
federated department stores inc would get approval for a 400 
million loan before a drop dead bank deadline enabling the 
retailer to keep its shelves stocked 
after more than eight hours of testimony thursday and a 
lastminute compromise proposed by federateds unsecured creditors 
us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug jr said he would review the 
agreement and sign it today 
a similar proposal by federateds sister retailer allied stores 
corp to borrow 300 million from chemical bank of new york was 
expected to face no opposition at a hearing today attorneys for 
federated told aug 
the 400 million debtorinpossession loan from a 90bank 
syndicate led by citibank would be in addition to a 1 billion 
financing package allowing federated to sell credit card receipts 
to a subsidiary federated credit corp the credit division wasnt 
among those that filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors 
jan 15 with federated and allied 
there was a great deal of testimony today that provided the 
committee with information that had not been available 
previously said lewis rosenbloom a lawyer for the committee of 
unsecured creditors 
it permitted the committee to better understand the 
consequences involved and we also were able to make some changes 
in debtors proposal to give the creditors greater assurances he 
said 
the committee also withdrew its opposition to the 1 billion 
receivables 
in return federated gave the unsecured creditors substantial 
protections rosenbloom said including guarantees that all 
inventory which the committee considered excess will remain in 
the estate federated also will provide a monthly accounting of all 
its operating units he said 
federated and allied the us retail division of torontobased 
campeau corp listed 77 billion in debt when they filed for 
chapter 11 protection 
the two divisions employ about 100000 people and operate 260 
stores within nine chains abraham and straus and bloomingdales 
of new york burdines of miami lazarus of cincinnati richs of 
atlanta in the federated group and the bon marche of seattle 
jordan marsh of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of 
paramus nj in the allied group 
federated treasurer mark kennedy testified at the hearing that 
federated could not survive more than a month without the infusion 
of money he said the retailer had been turned down by other 
lenders and that vendors would lose all confidence in federated if 
aug refused to approve the loan 
quick approval was needed to beat citibanks feb 14 deadline 
the creditors committee had opposed the loan contending that 
federated does not need the money and had pledged the creditors 
only collateral its inventory to get the loan 
but kennedy testified that federated had no contingency plan if 
approval were denied and that federated wouldnt survive the two 
months it would take to negotiate another loan providing a lender 
could be found 
the company doesnt have 60 days 30 days maybe kennedy 
said 
the existence of the loan is mandatory to reestablish our 
credibility in the eyes of our creditors a headline which says 
federated dip rejected would have a disastrous effect 
kennedy said failure to get the loan would put federated in 
default of the 1 billion receivables arrangement 
creditors had objected to federated putting its profitable store 
chains under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection kennedy testified 
that three of the profitable ones bloomingdales burdines and 
richs were worth more than 1 billion each and probably could be 
liquidated to pay creditors full value for their goods 
but he said although federated has 858 million in inventory and 
250 million cash on hand forcing federated to spend all its cash 
to buy merchandise would ensure its demise 
the biggest losers would be the creditors of this company 
kennedy said 
one of the provisions of the loan is that federated cannot 
borrow more than 40 percent of the wholesale value of its 
inventory meaning that federated could borrow the full 400 
million only if it had 1 billion in inventory

standard amp poors corp says sears roebuck and 
co deserves a lower debt rating because of the weak performance of 
its retailing business

downgrade 
on monday chicagobased sears released fourthquarter and 
annual results that were slightly better than expected but still

items were excluded 
sears has been battling a decadelong slide in its share of the 
retail market the company has pinned its hopes on the switch to 
everyday low pricing with competitive prices yearround and fewer 
sales

strong and its financialservices businesses dean witter

the former no 2 official at the general 
accounting office is emerging as the top candidate to replace 
thrift regulator m danny wall according to administration 
congressional and industry sources 
frederick d wolf is known for offering a blunt assessment of 
the savings and loan industry during 1988 when wall was offering a 
more optimistic evaluation 
he is backed by treasury department officials who worked with 
him while fashioning president bushs sampl bailout last year and by 
senior aides to the senate banking committee which would have to 
vote on his confirmation 
wolf has been lobbying for support from members of congress 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity thursday 
but wolfs independence and popularity with congressional 
democrats may hurt his candidacy according to two industry 
officials the administration must already cope with federal 
deposit insurance corp chairman l william seidman who often 
differs with treasury officials on regulatory issues 
the bailout legislation made walls agency the office of thrift 
supervision a wing of the treasury department also the thrift 
office director would sit on seidmans fivemember board which 
handles the deposit insurance funds for the sampl and banking 
industries and governs the resolution trust corp the sampl bailout 
agency 
wolfs enormously able outspoken blunt and understands the 
issues said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america but hes an 
independent force and theres some concern in treasury about 
bringing in an independent force 
however another industry official said when all is said and 
done i dont think they have another choice 
wolf did not return a telephone call seeking comment thursday 
about a dozen names of possible successors have circulated but 
most have ruled themselves out provisions in the sampl bill applying 
to the rtc would prevent the thrift office director from working 
for or representing an insured financial institution until two 
years after leaving office 
william taylor director of bank supervision for the federal 
reserve system was asked to consider the thrift office post but 
opted to stay at his current job which pays a higher salary and is 
independent of the administration according to congressional 
sources 
another possible candidate is william t graham banking 
commissioner in north carolina a former judge he was active in 
bushs 1980 and 1988 presidential campaigns according to a 
government source graham was interviewed in washington for the job 
meanwhile the administration is coming under increasing 
pressure to decide on a thrift director soon the us league of 
savings institutions and house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas have written to bush urging action 
i have applauded your never again statements about the 
savings and loan crisis gonzalez wrote the president earlier 
this month i am very disappointed that this affirmation has been 
diminished by allowing regulators who share responsibility for 
the disaster to remain in office 
wall who announced his resignation dec 4 after harsh criticism 
from congress for his handling of the failed lincoln savings and 
loan association is anxious to move on according to his aides 
an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the administration intended to decide on walls successor in 
the near future and called wolf an extremely capable 
experienced person 
but even if wolf is selected soon the clearance process 
including fbi checks could take several months 
before joining the gao wolf 49 spent 22 years with arthur 
andersen amp co an accounting firm he recently left the gao after 
six years including nine months as assistant comptroller general 
to become a partner at the price waterhouse amp co accounting firm 
the american banker a trade publication first reported wolfs 
emergence as the leading candidate for thrift office director

the oil slick spreading from the tanker 
american trader spilled into politics as officials and 
environmentalists demanded stronger controls on oil industry 
operations in coastal waters 
we need to do something to make sure this doesnt happen 
again attorney general john van de kamp a democratic candidate 
for governor told a news conference in huntington beach on 
thursday 
controller gray davis a member of the california lands 
commission pledged a state investigation into the 295000gallon 
spill and said his panel would urge congress to require tankers to 
be fitted with double hulls 
the commission which regulates oil development in state lands 
and waters has declared previously unprotected tracts in state 
waters offlimits to new drilling 
the spill off huntington beach renewed debate about requiring a 
double hull and double bottom on tankers a move opposed by many 
oil industry executives because of the higher cost and arguable 
safety advantages 
this oil spill is another warning that our legislators are 
dragging their feet on doublehulled tankers at great peril to our 
environment said dorothy green head of heal the bay a local 
environmental group 
a number of officials speculated that a large swell plopped the 
american trader onto its own anchor wednesday punching a 3foot 
hole into the singlehulled ships bottom as it maneuvered toward 
an offshore mooring 
if the information is born out that this tanker lifted up and 
came down on its own anchor doublehulling the vessel may well 
have prevented the spill said peter douglas executive director 
of the state coastal commission 
the double hull in this case could have avoided the spill 
said jerry aspland president of arco marine inc and a former ship 
captain experienced in offshore moorings 
but he stressed other factors including human error may have 
played a more significant role in the spill 
in washington democratic rep george miller said british 
petroleum oil shipping co usa which leased the american trader 
has led lobbying against comprehensive oil spill liability 
legislation pending in congress 
a conference committee is working on differing house and senate 
bills to produce a measure both chambers can approve by the march 
24 anniversary of the exxon valdez spill in alaskas prince william 
sound 
the main sticking point concerns double bottoms and double 
hulls the house wants them on all tankers calling at us ports 
with oil or hazardous materials within seven and 15 years 
respectively the senate bill calls for further study a position 
backed by the oil industry 
miller told a news conference that british petroleum was leading 
efforts to gut the oil spill liability bill 
that drew a response from bill rountree vice president for 
federal government affairs with british petroleum 
bp america has supported enactment of comprehensive oil spill 
legislation for close to a decade rountree said by telephone 
we support a 1 billion federal fund and increasing liability 
limits on ship owners 
using the american trader as a backdrop at a beachside news 
conference davis and lt gov leo mccarthy called on the state 
assembly to pass the oil spill prevention and cleanup act which 
would establish a 500 million reserve funded by the oil industry 
for spill cleanup 
davis said the oil companies to date have indicated they are 
willing to contribute a total of 10 million to such a fund 
the bill would require tankers operating in state waters to be 
equipped with booms and other cleanup equipment and require tanker 
companies to have 400 million in insurance to meet legal costs 
said ed manning a mccarthy aide who authored the legislation 
davis said thursday that had the bill been in effect british 
petroleum could have been required to pay an estimated 25 million 
penalty to the state 
the cleanup and prevention act will be heard feb 26 by the 
state assemblys natural resources commission manning said 
some activists said the spill should remind the nation about the 
hazards of reliance on oil as an energy source 
the whole issue is that every gallon of oil we save is one 
less gallon of oil that must be pumped and transported and one less 
gallon that can spill said bob hattoy regional director of the 
sierra club of southern california

environmentalists claim democratic senate 
leaders are buckling under to white house pressure and agreeing to 
too many weakening amendments during closeddoor talks on clean air 
legislation 
the public health is being negotiated away argued dan 
weiss who has been following the clean air debate in the senate 
for the sierra club 
senate leaders and bush administration officials have been 
negotiating for more than a week in an attempt to work out a 
compromise air pollution control bill and avoid a floor fight 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said thursday 
that he expected the criticism but said the critics should 
evaluate the final product against current law which he said 
would be greatly strengthened 
mitchell and sen bob dole rkan the minority leader said 
that although progress was being made further discussions are 
being delayed until after congress returns from a weeklong recess 
feb 20 
while tentative agreement has been reached some areas such as 
curbing toxic and smogcausing pollution by industry major 
differences remain over how to reduce urban smog caused by 
pollution from automobiles the senate bill calls for tough 
secondstage tailpipe controls while the administration says those 
provisions are too expensive and favors a phasein of alternative 
fuel cars in regions with the dirtiest air 
we are making progress said dole rkan who along with 
senior white house and environmental protection agency officials 
has been pushing for the changes sought by president bush in the 
closeddoor meetings 
but various environmental groups argued thursday that too many 
strong provisions in the original senate bill were being negotiated 
away under white house pressure 
theyre not talking about any strengthening amendments only 
weakening ones said richard ayres executive director of the 
clean air coalition which is made up of various environmental 
organizations 
the longer these negotiations go on the weaker the bill 
gets charged casey padgett legislative director for 
environmental action 
both the senate bill and the administration proposal call for 
tougher controls on auto pollution and releases of toxic and 
smogcausing pollution from industrial sources as well as a 10 
millionton reduction of acid rain pollutants primarily from 
electric power plants 
the environmentalists criticized a compromise allowing the 
environmental protection agency to issue a waiver of federal air 
quality standards for certain areas if the cost of doing so exceeds 
5000 per ton of pollution 
other provisions already agreed upon by the negotiators would no 
longer automatically require the epa to impose a clean air plan if 
local officials were unable or unwilling to do so 
administration officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
called the environmentalists criticisms groundless they said the 
epa still could disapprove any waiver and that the federal 
government has never imposed a cleanup program on a community 
anyway 
the officials argued that under the proposal urban areas still 
would have to improve their air quality by specific yearly 
increments something not now required

on the baseball diamond its mets versus cubs 
for architects its sears tower vs world trade center 
now nathans famous of new york has thrown some fat and other 
byproducts on the fire of the chicagonew york rivalry 
theyre calling it th war of the dogs 
relish the thought new yorkstyle frankfurters girded against 
chi dogs 
its still too early to tell which wiener can cut the mustard 
nathans of westbury ny dating back to 1916 and famous for 
its hot dog stands on coney islands boardwalk and 42nd street in 
the big apple decided last year to open a place in the windy 
city home to 3000 hot dog stands 
it looked like a tough market to crack for the new yorkers who 
say frank when they mean hot dog 
but nathans marketing research showed that many chicagoans were 
familiar with the companys name and would pay extra for a gourmet 
frank that cost 159 
we figured if we could make it there chicago we could make 
it anywhere said larry feierstein a vicepresident of nathans 
in new york new york 
frankly not everyone was throwing out the welcome mat 
does newcastle need coal does alaska need salmon does idaho 
need potatoes more than 3000 hot dog stands in greater grander 
metropolitan chicagoland and these people come bearing 
frankfurters said a tongueincheek editorial from the chicago 
tribune last week 
nevertheless around thanksgiving day nathans famous opened up 
shop where rush street meets state street in the heart of this 
citys glitzy entertainment district 
i like this place its clean its bright and its 
different said patrick a connolly 67 a chicago financier who 
was smoking a footlong cigar but carrying a couple of nathans 
regularsized franks on wednesday night the taste is out of this 
world 
connolly said he can afford the posh eateries in the 
neighborhood but prefers the dogs at nathans 
barry potekin coowner of downtowns gold coast dog has 
challenged nathans to a hot dog taste test 
they called themselves the gucci of hot dogs that ticked us 
off what is this perfume he asked 
bob hardison is caught between the dog soldiers of each side 
hes a chicagoan but manages the citys first nathans 
i like both styles he insisted diplomatically 
the new york style he explained is with mustard and 
sauerkraut while chicago style is with mustard relish onions 
tomatoes peppers and just about anything else that will fit on the 
bun 
not wanting to choose sides nathans has a condiment bar for 
customers to choose their own fixings 
theres also a difference in the way the two dogs are cooked 
nathans frank is prepared on a griddle while chicagos dogs 
are usually boiled in water 
nathans dogs are more intense and spicier but not altogether 
more pleasant than chicagos dogs said tribune food critic phil 
vettel 
but wednesday night a 50yearold man remembered bygone dogs 
and said that neither citys product was frankly worth sniffing 
at 
the best hotdog place was daves at homan and roosevelt when i 
was 8 said harvey shapiro a messenger service employee it 
was 20 cents for a hotdog and an orange crush

federated department stores inc and allied stores corp which 
sought protection from their creditors jan 15 under chapter 11 of 
the federal bankruptcy act 
while cdc is not directly affected by the bankruptcy filings 
of the retailing operations it is indirectly impacted since in

the stock market moved modestly higher today

the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose more than 4 
points on thursday added another 653 to 265090 after 30 minutes

some analysts say the completion of the treasurys 30 billion 
auction of new securities on thursday should take some of the 
pressure off stocks 
the auction ended with the sale of 10 billion in 30year bonds 
the bond sale received a less enthusiastic reception than the 
sales of 10 billion in threeyear notes and a like amount of 
10year notes earlier in the week but some analysts said the fact 
that the auctions are over should take some pressure off interest 
rates anyway 
rising interest rates make yields on fixedincome securities 
more competitive with those on stocks reduce chances for corporate 
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy 
stocks 
before the market opened today the government reported a steep 
18 percent rise in its producer price index in january after a 
06 percent gain in december and the biggest onemonth increase in 
more than 15 years

as if the federal government didnt play a big 
enough role in the credit markets its taken on a big new position 
in junk bonds 
the nations biggest and most creditworthy issuer of ious will 
be looking to unload a bundle of some of the riskiest paper around 
following the recent federal seizure of centrust bank floridas 
largest thrift 
the treasury departments office of thrift supervision ordered 
the seizure on feb 2 saying centrust was unsound largely because 
of large and mounting losses on its securities portfolio 
that included 922 million of junk bonds at the end of last 
september the most recent figures available said kenneth h 
thomas who runs a miamibased bank and thrift consultancy 
it wasnt the first junk pill swallowed by the resolution trust 
corp the federal agency responsible for selling assets of failed 
thrifts but it was easily the biggest 
city federal savings of elizabeth nj had junk holdings of 
715 million last september and lincoln savings and loan of los 
angeles had 339 million thomas says both institutions were 
seized by the government late last year 
all told thomas said thrifts now in federal hands owned 23 
billion in junk bonds as of last september 
how and when the rtc peddles its junk holdings could add more 
angst to the 200 billion junk market reeling lately from steady 
bad news the bankruptcy filings of campeau corps department 
store groups a low credit rating for an rjr nabisco issue and 
heavy selling by speculators 
anytime you put 2 billion of paper in the market its just 
one more adverse factor on the supply side said martin fridson 
managing director in charge of highyield bond research at merrill 
lynch capital markets 
but rtc spokesman steve katsanos said the agency isnt 
interested in a fire sale that could only cost taxpayers more money 
and unsettle the market 
everything we have is for sale he said its not for sale 
at any price 
the prospect of selling by thrifts isnt new for the junk 
market the congressional bailout bill for thrifts enacted last 
august requires sampls to sell their junk holdings which totaled 
132 billion in september by 1994 
its unclear whether the federally controlled thrifts have 
dumped some of their junk holdings since september katsanos said 
he couldnt provide a current figure for the rtcs holdings 
nevertheless thomas said the centrust debacle presents the 
federal agency with a new problem although other failed thrifts 
owned junk bonds their failures stemmed primarily from sour real 
estate loans or fraud he said not so with centrust 
this is the first thrift that definitely failed without a 
doubt because of junk bonds he said 
centrust owned some of the riskiest junk paper of any thrift 
thomas contended including those financing operations of eastern 
airlines braniff integrated resources and hillsborough holdings 
which have either filed for bankruptcy protection or defaulted on 
their debts 
anyone thinking of giving the government a bid for some of 
centrusts bonds must carefully research what the holdings are and 
if they can be traded said alan schlesinger head of junk bond 
trading at donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
warren greene who runs a 12 million highyield portfolio at 
his american investors income fund inc in greenwich conn said 
he doesnt think its likely anyone will bid for centrusts entire 
junk portfolio because the market is so weak 
still he said that weakness presents the government with other 
possible buyers the companies who issued the junk bonds while 
some highly publicized junk issuers are in default many are viable 
companies that can book big profits and eliminate interest payments 
by buying back their debt at steep discounts greene said 
some bond brokerages also could try to repackage some of 
centrusts holdings into new types of debt securities that carry 
less risk said fridson of merrill lynch 
i think a lot of people are talking to them the rtc and 
suggesting ideas he said 
whatever the rtc decides junk marketers agree on one piece of 
advice dont panic 
fridson said if the sampl industry shedded its junk portfolio 
gradually over the next four years the amount it would have to 
sell each year would equal just 7 percent of the average new issue 
volume in each of the past three years 
its not an amount thats unmanageable he said 
added schlesinger sell them when you can not when you have 
to

a double wallop delivered to energy and food 
prices by the holiday cold snap sent wholesale inflation soaring 
18 percent in january the steepest onemonth rise in more than 15 
years the government said today 
the spurt in the labor departments producer price index was 
nearly triple the already brisk 06 percent gain in december if 
wholesale inflation persisted at the january pace it would produce 
an annual price rise of 241 percent 
the last monthly increase of greater magnitude was recorded in 
november 1974 during the opec oil embargo when prices shot up 2 
percent in one month 
last months gain was even steeper than the 12 percent jump 
predicted by most analysts 
economists however were not overly concerned january 
inflation one stop short of the retail level was attributed almost 
entirely to sharp but temporary increases in the price of fuel oil 
and vegetables 
the socalled core rate of inflation prices excluding the 
volatile food and energy sectors rose a slight 01 percent in 
january the mildest rise since july 
financial markets which usually react badly to scary inflation 
numbers started the morning with a rally the dow jones average of 
industrial stocks rose 653 points to 265090 
without food and energy commodity price inflation was very 
low said economimst allen sinai of the boston co the bad news 
is the overall january number was incredibly high and consumers 
will pay higher prices for food and energy for a while longer the 
good news is the report suggests much of the activity was 
weatherrelated and will diminish in coming months 
energy prices in january rose 136 percent the biggest increase 
since the labor department began compiling that index in 1974 fuel 
oil prices were up a startling 253 percent also the biggest jump 
on record 
as refineries switched production to fuel oil supplies of 
gasoline grew short sending those prices up 167 percent natural 
gas costs rose a brisk 32 percent 
food costs meanwhile shot up 21 percent the sharpest rise in 
six years the price of fresh and dried vegetable rose 58 percent 
for the month the largest seasonally adjusted gain recorded since 
the department began tracking that category in 1967 
egg prices climbed 125 percent on top of a 91 percent rise in 
december over the past 12 months egg costs have risen 452 
percent fruit was up 39 percent and fish rose 63 percent 
the increases were partly offset by substantial declines for 
other items rice dropped 11 percent pasta 58 percent 
chickens 28 percent and turkeys 119 percent 
in other categories prices rose 29 percent for childrens 
clothing 08 percent for mens and womens clothing and 09 
percent for home electronic equipment 
that was mostly counterbalanced by drops of 13 percent for 
tobacco which had risen 22 percent in december 07 percent for 
automobiles the result of a new round of discounting at auto 
dealerships and 07 percent for tires 
the various changes put the producer price index at 1175 in 
january this meant that a hypothetical marketbasket of goods 
which cost 100 in 1982 cost 11750 last month up from 11110 a 
year earlier 
soaring energy costs also drove up inflation in earlier stages 
of the production process the price of intermediate goods rose 12 
percent overall but only 01 percent excluding food and energy 
the price of crude goods was up 24 percent overall and 02 percent 
minus food and energy 
an example of the three stages would be bread for finished 
goods flour for intermediate and wheat for crude 
despite the big january increase many economists were expecting 
wholesale inflation to moderate this year compared with the 48 
percent rate last year 
the bush administration last week predicted inflation of about 4 
percent in line with most private forecasts 
the us economy is on the weakish side and the pressures 
of slowing demand will continue to keep inflation at least stable 
and possibly lower over the next year said economist samuel d 
kahan of fuji securities inc in chicago you might not see a 
collapse in the inflation rate but certainly an acceleration seems 
unlikely 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan strengthened that 
impression last week when he told congress the risk of recession 
receded from last spring and inflation although stable was 
unacceptably high that was taken by financial markets as a sign 
the fed would not be lowering interest rates anytime soon 
in recent years the fed has kept interest rates high in order 
to fight inflation by slowing economic growth it has cut rates 
only when the economy seemed in danger of lapsing into a recession 
monetary policymakers met earlier this week and most analysts 
believe they decided to leave interest rates unchanged for now

the stock market turned mixed in less active 
dealings this morning after opening higher 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose more than 
428 points on thursday was down 631 at 263806 after 90 minutes 
of trading 
but advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of 6 to 5 
among issues listed on the new york stock exchange with 646 up 
561 down and 522 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 5306 million issues as of 11 
am on wall street compared with 6336 million shares at the same 
point in thursdays session 
some analysts say the completion of the treasurys 30 billion 
auction of new securities on thursday should take some of the 
pressure off stocks 
the auction ended with the sale of 10 billion in 30year bonds 
the bond sale received a less enthusiastic reception than the 
sales of 10 billion in threeyear notes and a like amount of 
10year notes earlier in the week but some analysts said the fact 
that the auctions are over should take some pressure off interest 
rates anyway 
rising interest rates make yields on fixedincome securities 
more competitive with those on stocks reduce chances for corporate 
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy 
stocks 
before the market opened today the government reported a steep 
18 percent rise in its producer price index in january after a 
06 percent gain in december and the biggest onemonth increase in 
more than 15 years 
but analysts had been expecting a sharp rise as the holiday 
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring 
in the credit markets today bond prices edged higher and 
interest rates slipped

mixed in early trading

offer of wheat to china had swept through the markets about a month 
ago 
its not like we didnt have an inkling it was coming she 
said 
traders guessed the chinese will buy a combination of oldcrop 
and newcrop wheat 
the usda announcement which came after the close of trading 
thursday stirred speculation that wheat will also be offered to 
the soviet union ms leighty said

the government today announced plans to 
toughen rules on the health claims that food marketers can make 
about their products 
the new policy to be published in the federal register next 
week is a midcourse correction of regulations that have 
allowed food sellers to make health claims since 1987 said health 
and human services secretary louis sullivan 
only with such a consistent set of standards can americans be 
sure of the meaning of health information on food labels he said 
in a statement announcing the food and drug administrations 
proposed rules 
the fdas proposal would let companies make specific health 
claims if they fall within a narrow range of messages concerning 
the relationship between diet and health benefits detailed in 
recent studies by the us surgeon general and the national academy 
of sciences claims outside this narrow range would be allowed only 
in certain circumstances 
as science finds additional links between diet and health 
these could also be included in our health messages policy 
sullivan said 
the fda used to prohibit healthrelated messages on food 
products but in 1987 the agency proposed a set of liberal 
regulations that allowed health claims it was criticized as being 
too broad and permissive the new proposal supersedes the 1987 
proposed rule 
the office of management and budget which reviews draft 
regulations of all executive branch agencies approved the new 
policy on wednesday without substantial changes an fda official 
said 
the new policy will allow health claims only about fiber and 
colon cancer fiber and heart disease fats and cancer fats and 
heart disease sodium and high blood pressure and calcium and 
osteoporosis a softening of the bones sometimes found in the 
elderly 
many scientists believe that in some circumstances fiber might 
reduce colon cancer and heart disease fats might increase cancer 
and heart disease high concentrations of sodium increase blood 
pressure and calcium can help prevent osteoporosis 
the new policy could take a year to be completely implemented 
until then claims will be considered on a casebycase basis 
among the fda considerations will be whether the good 
outweighs the bad in following the sellers advice said the 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity this might for 
example rule out health claims for lowcholesterol food that is 
high in saturated fats since scientists believe saturated fats in 
the diet are more important in forming cholesterol in the blood 
than diet cholesterol itself 
the official declined to give examples of current claims the 
agency could act against under the new policy 
however the agency has said it has serious concerns about 
cereals with husks of psyllium which contain soluble fiber 
the fda also has criticized the american heart associations new 
heartguide program to label brands it approves as heart 
healthy with a prominent mark 
the official said the new policy did not directly bear on the 
heart groups action the association had said it would review the 
program plans when the new policy was published

if entertainment weekly flops dont blame the 
marketers 
the first major weekly magazine from the time inc magazine co 
since the expensive failure of tvcable week seven years ago debuts 
monday after a marketing blitz that smaller magazine operations can 
only envy 
television commercials late at night have invited viewers to 
subscribe by phone new members of the bookofthemonth club got 
offers of free issues 
but the crowning stroke may have been during the two weeks 
preceding the magazines premiere that was when entertainment 
weekly tucked a 12page supplement in its sister publications 
time people sports illustrated fortune and money and gave an 
estimated 61 million readers a sneak preview 
the supplement had a cover photo of a guntoting warren beatty 
dressed like dick tracy in a broadbrimmed hat and bright yellow 
coat 
but the best thing about the exposure was that it was free 
because the magazines are published within the same company the 
only thing entertainment weekly had to pay for was production 
publisher michael j klingensmith estimated it would have cost 
an outsider at least 5 million for the same exposure 
the magazine is the dream child of two aging busy yuppies who 
wished they had a single source of information on what to watch 
read or listen to on any given night 
they hope a million or more active relatively affluent 
babyboomers like themselves would like to find the magazine in the 
mailbox every week 
these people have plenty of money what they dont have is a 
lot of time the bigger loss for them is a lost evening rather than 
a lost 30 said klingensmith 37 
managing editor jeff jarvis 35 the former tv critic for people 
magazine said twothirds of each issue will be reviews of movies 
records books magazines television programs and videos the 
critics will give grades a to f 
the other third will have features about entertainment products 
where can you go to create a customized music cassette how do 
authors go about gathering material and how has the threat of 
censorship affected the television business 
what you wont find is gossip about celebrities personal lives 
if you want to find out about a stars wedding or divorce go to 
people well tell you about their movie jarvis said 
magazine consultant martin s walker wonders whether 
entertainment weekly can survive by sticking to that premise 
the real question i have is can you come out with a 
newsoriented weekly that is not gossipandcelebrityoriented and 
find the audience he said 
klingensmith and jarvis say you can they have spent years 
making the case 
the two men independently proposed a magazine like entertainment 
weekly in 1984 the company still in shock over the 47 million 
loss it took on the failed tv cable week a year earlier failed to 
act on the ideas 
about 2 years ago klingensmith revived his proposal noting 
the growing popularity of cable and pay television portable tape 
players and videocassette recorders the appetite for entertainment 
products he argued was enormous 
a time executive took note of the suggestion and recalled that 
jarvis had made a similar proposal he suggested the two men team 
up 
they did and the brass liked what they heard a direct mailing 
of a prototype issue received a very strong response 
klingensmith said and the company gave the goahead the magazine 
plans were announced last summer 
klingensmith expects to surpass plans for average circulation of 
600000 during the first year the magazine will rely mainly on 
subscriptions the price is 5148 a year or 195 a copy at 
newstands 
despite a sluggish advertising environment he said demand for 
space in the magazine has exceeded expectations with more than 100 
companies signing up 
klingensmith knows how badly time executives want a winner this 
time out 
this is the companys first magazine launch since parent time 
inc bought warner communications inc last year saddling itself 
with debt and changing its name to time warner inc 
time warner president nicholas j nicholas told a columbia 
university audience last fall that the company was prepared to 
invest 150 million in the magazine klingensmith said the 
outofpocket cash costs will be much smaller on the order of 30 
million until it breaks even within five years 
media critics will be watching to see if the magazine plays 
favorites with sister company products such as warner bros movies 
or pans offerings from rival companies klingensmith and jarvis 
insist that wont happen 
it is one of the most exciting new concepts to come along in 
recent years said rich hamilton media director for the 
advertsing agency darcy masius benton amp bowles but the reader 
will tell us if it succeeds

money managers say a move by the new york stock 
exchange to persuade big investors to report suspected program 
trading abuses by their brokers is no solution to curbing volatile 
price swings that sometimes afflict the market 
the big board in recent months has sent letters to 100 top 
institutional investors providing two telephone numbers they can 
call with suspicions about bigblock computerized trades by brokers 
that may run afoul of exchange regulations 
the nyse and two futures exchanges have been investigating 
suspected market manipulation involving stocks and stockindex 
futures since the minicrash last october renewed complaints that 
program trading was causing trading turmoil 
the main target of the probe is said to be a technique known as 
frontrunning in which traders profit on the knowledge of orders 
placed with them by buying or selling stocks or stockindex futures 
or options before placing the orders 
theres no way in the world youre going to know its being 
done in front of you donald dreman managing partner of dreman 
value management which handles about 4 billion in investor funds 
said today 
by calling the exchange to effectively squeal on their own 
broker institutional investors who hire brokerage firms to conduct 
program trading estimated at less than 100 nationwide would 
risk losing face not to mention business 
youre going to endanger your relationship and if theres 
nothing there you look quite silly said dreman who opposes 
program trading it may be a propaganda ploy to say the exchange 
is doing things 
in a statement the nyse said thursday that the probe of several 
volatile trading days was continuing in conjunction with the 
chicago mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade 
if trading abuses are found to have taken place the nyse will 
take appropriate enforcement action with respect to parties within 
our jurisdiction the statement said 
program traders use computer models to buy and sell large blocks 
of stocks with opposite purchases of stockindex futures or options 
to capitalize on brief and small price differences 
investigators are said to be examining volatile trading oct 13 
when the dow jones industrial average sank 190 points and the 
following trading day when it regained 80 points during the course 
of the day also under scrutiny is oct 24 when the market 
seesawed in wild trading 
exchange officials declined further comment on the issue 
including details on the letters to institutional investors 
proferring the directaccess telephone numbers dubbed a hot 
line by the wall street journal the nyse refused to say whether 
the lines were set up exclusively for the institutions 
fund managers calling the numbers would reach the nyses market 
surveillance department which would analyze specific transactions 
suspected of fishy trading 
program trading critics said the telephone lines were 
insignificant in regulating abuses and some criticized 
selfpolicing by the exchanges as inadequate to ferret out trading 
irregularities 
some wall street professionals said the federal government 
should unify regulation of the nations stock and futures markets 
the securities and exchange commission now regulates the stock 
markets while the commodity futures trading commission handles 
futures trading 
thats what we need not action line said james j cramer 
president of cramer amp co a small new york money management firm 
its up to the institutions to get together and say something 
about it said neil weisman a general partner with the money 
management firm chilmark capital partners unless the 
institutions decide not to deal with anyone doing program trading 
its not going to stop 
many fund managers have complained that abuses of program 
trading not the tactic itself are responsible for market 
volatility and have called for a specific attack on improprieties 
specialists who set opening prices and manage the flow of 
trading on the stock exchange floor also are said to have called on 
nyse chairman john j phelan jr in recent months to take stronger 
action to curb program trading abuses

floating black globs of crude 
oil and brown foam splashed ashore today as winds drove strips of a 
quartermilliongallon spill onto golden beaches beloved by surfers 
and sun worshipers 
about 2000 residents called city hall to volunteer to help 300 
professionals start cleaning up the mess mayor thomas j mays said 
we were on our knees scooping up the oil and putting it into 
bags said steve brick one of the volunteers who showed up 
before dawn today the oil was seeping down into the sand our 
hands were just black when we finished 
the 811foot tanker american trader carried 21 million gallons 
when its singlewall hull was punctured apparently by an anchor 
as it approached an oil pipeline mooring about 1 miles offshore 
wednesday night 
the tanker lost between 250000 and 300000 gallons of oil from 
a forward compartment that held 1386000 gallons coast guard 
chief petty officer mark kennedy said 
when the leak stopped thursday night the coast guard began 
pumping the remaining oil and water from the compartment onto a 
barge by 6 am today about 26000 gallons had been transferred 
said lt cmdr alan carver 
ten skimming boats worked on the slick which covered water over 
an area roughly measuring 6 miles by 4 miles seas were calm and 
winds light 
the weather has cooperated kennedy said 
offshore winds thursday had kept the slick away from beaches 
until afternoon when they reversed direction and began nudging the 
mess onto shore pockets of crude oil began washing ashore thursday 
night 
a 4mile stretch was fouled in newport beach an affluent 
community that boasts some of southern californias most expensive 
beachfront property 
the oily goop washed ashore along a milelong expanse north of 
huntington pier on bolsa chica state beach which borders a 
sensitive estuary habitat officials said 
more oil hit along a quartermilelong stretch of beach south of 
the pier renowned from references in beach boys surf songs and its 
use in films as a surfing set 
at least eight oilcoated sea birds were found in the fouled 
surf early today said newport beach lifeguard eric bauer 
altogether about 50 oiled seabirds have been found and about 
half that number had died as of this morning kennedy said at 
least one california brown pelican was among the dead birds 
john richards of newport beach and his fiancee found one of the 
birds 
he was floating in the surf area and he washed up and then he 
tried to fly away and he just flopped over richards said 
coast guard commandant adm paul yost said american traders 
hull apparently was punctured when it hit something on the bottom 
as the crew prepared to hook up to an underwater pipeline that 
carries crude oil to shore it was unclear if the tanker hit one of 
its own anchors or a buoy anchor he said 
the ship had been chartered by british petroleum oil shipping 
co usa to deliver alaskan north slope crude oil to the golden west 
refinery in santa fe springs 
the ship owned and operated by american trading transportation 
co inc of new york was maneuvering to a mooring before pumping 
its load ashore via the refinery pipeline said company president 
sanford schmidt 
the seas and weather were calm at the time of the accident 
federally mandated alcohol tests given to the ships captain 
robert la ware the pilot the first mate and the second mate all 
came back negative the coast guard said drug test results were 
not complete 
yost described the spill as major 
the coast guard is taking this very seriously as are the 
people of this region and were going to see you get a good 
cleanup here yost said 
mays said the huntington beach cleanup largely would be done 
with shovels rakes and garbage bags in newport beach about a 
dozen employees of a private cleanup company stood at waters edge 
overnight using a spongy material to mop up the oil globules 
floating in on the waves 
the tanker still about 1 miles off the coast was surrounded 
by an oil containment boom 
six oilrecovery boats worked to mop up the slick in calm seas 
thursday and eight more were scheduled to start work today an 
estimated 5 percent of the slick had been skimmed by late thursday 
coast guard lt vincent campos said 
use of chemical dispersants was under discussion campos 
said as officials weighed possible environmental damage from the 
chemicals against harm from the oil 
workers laid booms to protect fragile estuaries at the santa ana 
river mouth anaheim bay bolsa chica wetlands and upper newport 
bay all scenic wildlife havens the seal beach national wildlife 
refuge which is farther north along the coast was being monitored 
john turner director of the us fish and wildlife service 
said the oil posed a hazard to such endangered creatures as the 
peregrine falcon brown pelican and lightfooted clapper rail 
the cleanup will be paid for by american trading or its 
insurance company said british petroleum spokesman chuck webster 
huntington beach is a city of 180000 about 35 miles southeast 
of los angeles newport beach about five miles down the coast has 
about 70000 residents

the us dollar strengthened marginally against 
major currencies except the west german mark and british pound in 
european trading friday gold prices fell 
foreign exchange dealers said dollar trading was secondary to 
activity in marks pounds and japanese yen 
mark sexton senior dealer at the bank of montreal said that as 
the pound gained on the mark the british currency looked the 
safest to be in right now with britains high 15 percent bank 
base lending rate seeming likely to continue for some time 
traders said there had been euphoria over the mark because of 
the upheavals in eastern europe but more realism had now set in 
amid confusion over the possible merging of the currencies of the 
two germanys 
the markets could not decide whether an unexpectedly sharp rise 
of 18 percent in us producer prices in janaury would result in 
an increase in us interest rates 
in london one british pound cost 16930 late friday more 
expensive for buyers than thursdays late 16885 
earlier in tokyo with trading quiet the dollar fell to 14472 
yen from 14550 late thursday in london late friday the dollar 
traded higher at 14520 yen

the stock market pushed higher this afternoon in 
sluggish dealings as interest rates slipped 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose more than 
428 points on thursday was up 653 at 265090 with two hours 
left in the session 
advancing issues outpaced declines by a margin of 7 to 6 among 
issues listed on the new york stock exchange with 750 up 627 down 
and 528 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 10213 million issues as of 2 
pm est compared with 13264 million shares at the same point in 
thursdays session 
the market opened higher but then pulled back even as bonds 
advanced prices rallied again in the afternoon 
some analysts say the completion of the treasurys 30 billion 
auction of new securities on thursday should take some of the 
pressure off stocks 
the auction ended with the sale of 10 billion in 30year bonds 
which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of 10 
billion in threeyear notes and a like amount of 10year notes 
earlier in the week 
but some analysts said the fact that the auctions are over 
should take some pressure off interest rates anyway 
rising interest rates make yields on fixedincome securities 
more competitive with those on stocks reduce chances for corporate 
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy 
stocks 
before the market opened today the government reported a steep 
18 percent rise in its producer price index in january the 
biggest onemonth increase in more than 15 years 
but analysts had been expecting a sharp rise as the holiday 
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring 
bond prices edged higher in the credit markets today and 
interest rates slipped 
among active issues on the nyse philip morris was up lsqb at 39

silently the hunter banked left and spotted her 
prey she moved closer and struck 
could i have a onepound fillet of shark maria suarez asked 
the seafood clerk at a miami market and do you have any lemons 
sharks feared kings of the ocean food chain are increasingly 
ending up as dinner meat in your local supermarket chain theyve 
become a main course for americans who have discovered the fish to 
be inexpensive but tasty 
in addition the expansion of trade with china since the 
mid1980s dramatically boosted demand for atlantic and gulf shark 
fins used for a soup considered an asian delicacy 
but a nearly sixfold increase in shark catches since 1985 has 
alarmed environmentalists who fear populations are dwindling to 
dangerously low levels off the southeast coast despite their 
ferocious image many sharks perform a useful function cleaning 
the sea floor and controlling other fish populations federal 
officials are drafting a proposal that would limit catches and 
could temporarily ban shark fishing 
unlike other fish sharks reproduce slowly and may take up to 15 
years to mature in areas of intensive fishing it could require up 
to 30 years for the shark population to recover said jose castro 
a shark specialist at the national marine fisheries service in 
miami 
the proposed regulations which may take effect this summer 
would limit the us commercial harvest to the 1988 level of about 
1276 million pounds up from 213 million pounds in 1985 the 
draft proposal also seeks to outlaw the practice of capturing 
sharks only for their fins 
florida and alabama account for about 80 percent of the nations 
commercial shark catch 
the catch limit will probably already be reached if the 
regulations take effect in late july or august said lt eric hawk 
an official at national oceanic and atmospheric administration who 
is helping draft the final plan 
whether you call it retroactive to january or an allout ban 
commercial shark fishing will probably close the day the rules go 
into effect said hawk 
meanwhile federal officials will study shark populations and 
revise the regulations for the summer of 1991 he said 
they are beautifully adapated in their environment said 
castro but they havent had time to adapt to this new predator 
in the sea which is man 
most are caught on baited hooks connected to cables stretching 
for miles behind fishing boats the most prized species for meat 
include the sand bar mako and thresher sharks said wayne swingle 
executive director of the tampabased gulf of mexico fishery 
management council 
some species such as hammerheads often have bloody 
unappetizing meat and may be used only for their fins he said 
we were promoting shark back in the early 80s when it was 
something real unusual said donna florio seafood marketing 
director at the south carolina wildlife amp marine resources 
department now we dont have to do too much people are 
learning about shark and are not afraid to eat it cost is a big 
factor 
shark meat brings fishermen about 65 cents a pound and shark 
fins about 10 a pound said fisherman john bonnell of madeira 
beach the hub of floridas gulf coast shark fleet 
but bonnell said he believes the proposed regulations could 
drive shark fishermen out of business and force us seafood 
retailers to turn to mexico and perhaps cuba as main suppliers 
why would they come to us if we can only fish for half the 
year when mexico can provide them all the shark they want all year 
round said bonnell a former grouper fishermen who refitted his 
boats for shark years ago 
bonnell and other shark fishermen are calling for officials to 
wait at least a year before making regulation proposals 
were not totally against regulation but so little is known 
about the effects on the sharks that we should wait until better 
data is collected said bonnell we would be the first to 
recognize a collapse in the shark population and weve seen no 
decrease in the number or size of our catch 
in the sharkfin market highflying profits have dipped since 
chineseus relations cooled because of beijings violent 
suppression of a prodemocracy movement in june but gulf shark 
fins remain the most prized in the world said sonya girard a 
shark fin dealer in golden meadow la 
the us fins are sought because of the high content of a 
noodlelike substance in species such as lemons and blues whose 
fins can retail for more than 20 a pound dried 
the noodles are like pasta and come in all different sizes 
from thick like linguine to angel hair said ms girard who once 
received 300 worth of shark fins in the mail from a fisherman 
ms girard noted sharks have nonculinary uses ranging from 
cancer research to an aphrodisiac made from ground backbone 
cartilage favored by japanese geishas 
in the 1940s shark livers provided a high source of vitamin a 
which now can be made synthetically 
like many in the shark trade ms girard doubts the practice of 
finning is as common as portrayed during public hearings on the 
proposed federal regulations last year 
its an emotional issue she said i dont think too many 
fishermen are going to cut off the fins and dump 800 worth of meat 
back into the sea 
sid preskitt at trans ocean inc shark fin dealers in port 
orange fla attributed the growing popularity of shark meat to 
better knowledge by fishermen on how to process the fish 
to be edible sharks must be caught alive and the tail and head 
severed immediately to allow drainage of blood which contains a 
high urea content and turns to ammonia quickly after the shark 
dies the carcass is then submerged in a cold brine solution that 
leaches out more blood 
shark is something a little different to eat and its cheap 
said ms girard its become a real yuppie food

afternoon in sluggish dealings as interest rates slipped and 
investors took a favorable view of an inflation report 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose more than 
428 points on thursday was up 338 at 264775 with one hour left

which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of 10 
billion in threeyear notes and a like amount of 10year notes

should take some pressure off interest rates anyway 
rising interest rates make yields on fixedincome securities

earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy 
stocks

more dismal news from wall street the nations 
leading brokerages made 21 percent less money underwriting stocks 
and bonds in 1989 than the year before figures released monday 
show 
the total dollar volume and number of underwritings also fell 
sharply last year and analysts expect firms to slash underwriting 
staffs to cope with the 1990s climate of conservatism following the 
1980s boom 
with lower levels of revenue and outlook for smaller dollar 
volume of business chances are you could see departments trim back 
10 to 15 percent in 1990 said veteran industry analyst perrin 
long of lipper analytical services 
wall street already has begun retrenching in other areas of the 
securities business with a number of major firms laying off 
thousands of workers across the board in recent months 
in underwriting investment firms acquire new stocks and bonds 
issued by corporations that are seeking to raise money and sell 
them to the investing public the firms charge companies a 
percentage of the offer price in the range of 6 percent on stocks 
and less than 1 percent on bonds 
in an apparent attempt to stanch some of the underwriting 
business decline and to compete in a weak market wall street firms 
last year cut back the average fee they charged to issue stocks and 
bonds for corporate clients according to data compiled by idd 
information services 
but even that didnt help drum up much new business 
for the full year total underwriting fee revenue declined 811 
million or 209 percent to 307 billion from 388 billion in 
1988 idd reported the average fee as a percentage of dollar 
volume shrank to 159 percent from 171 percent 
fees from debt issues fell by 16 percent in 1989 and from all 
common stock issues by about 30 percent idd said 
the biggest declines last year were in the area of initial 
public stock offerings by companies with fees plummeting about 43 
percent to 889 million from 156 billion in 1988 a slowdown in 
stock market activity was the primary reason for the drop 
its an expensive proposition to float new equity long 
said obviously you didnt have many new ipos because the market 
wasnt doing anything 
money made from selling new issues of highyield lowgrade junk 
bonds shrank about 14 percent to 795 million from 923 million 
idd said analysts attributed that drop to the virtual collapse in 
the junk bond market in the second half of 1989 when several 
companies scrapped large planned debt offers 
merrill lynch capital markets was the overall leader in 
underwriting fees reaping 448 million or 146 percent of the 
market in second place was drexel burnham lambert inc which made 
nearly all of its 378 million in fees from junkbond offers idd 
did not compare the fee rankings to 1988 
drexel has shrunk to nearly half its size since it pleaded 
guilty to felony crimes and paid 650 million to settle government 
insider trading charges the firms share of the junk bond market 
while still commanding is decreasing 
for the full year total stock and bond underwriting volume 
declined by about 15 percent to 1936 billion from 2274 billion 
in 1988 ipos dived by 42 percent to 137 billion from 235 
billion and junk bond issues fell 48 percent to 2805 billion 
from 2947 billion 
the total number of debt and equity issues also declined 
sharply to 1452 in 1989 from 1759 the previous year there were 
184 initial public offerings last year down from 202 in 1988 and 
125 junkbond issues down from 151 
merrill lynch amp co retained its no 1 ranking handling a total 
of 46 billion as lead underwriter goldman sachs amp co remained 
second while first boston corp moved up to third swapping places 
with salomon brothers inc 
drexels share of the junkbond underwriting market slipped to 
387 percent from 428 percent in 1988 but the firm remained by 
far the industry leader with shearson lehman hutton inc moving up 
to second place from 12th but with just 94 percent of the market

many investors who are worried about rising 
interest rates have focused their angst on mixed results from the 
latest treasury department auction of new us debt 
but another source of interestrate paranoia emerged this past 
week and it came streaming through the holes in the berlin wall 
east and west germany which have been stunning the world with 
speedy moves toward reunification dropped another big surprise 
the west german mark soon could become the national currency of 
both countries 
monetary union had been considered the theoretical final phase 
of reunification but east germanys economy is so weak and its 
currency so worthless that the west proposed financial melding much 
sooner 
this proposal was aimed largely at persuading east germans to 
stay on their side of the border otherwise west germans feared 
their cousins would migrate en masse swamping west germanys 
already overburdened social welfare system and turning east 
germanys staterun economy into a rusty abandoned hulk 
but the monetary union proposal could carry an enormous price 
reaching far beyond germany and across the atlantic in an indirect 
way it could force interest rates to rise in this country 
the reason some economists argue is that monetary union will 
acutely strain west germanys economy the most powerful in europe 
by forcing the west german government to print billions of new 
marks and borrow large sums of money by selling bonds 
to control inflation and attract buyers for the bonds the west 
germans will have to offer higher interest rates that will force 
the united states treasury to raise the rates offered on its debt 
securities to keep them competitive to buyers looking for the best 
returns 
the new fear about the impact of monetary union injected new 
uncertainty into the us bond market which had been preoccupied 
with the mixed results of the latest treasury refunding auction 
the auctions have an enormous influence in determining us 
interest rates depending on the yields the treasury must offer to 
persuade investors to buy the new debt 
some economists say the us bond markets behavior this past 
week shows how in many respects it has become a hostage to foreign 
events beyond americas control 
one reason is the large us budget deficit which forces the 
treasury to sell large amounts of governmentbacked ious to 
foreigners but another is the ease with which investors transcend 
borders and move money anywhere they can earn the most profit 
for many germany already looks increasingly attractive at 
current yields for example a 10year us treasury earns about 
831 percent and a comparable 10year west german government bond 
earns about 828 percent but when the higher us inflation rate 
is factored in the west german bond earns more 
when i started trading bonds 20 years ago the last thing in 
the world we cared about were what interest rates were doing in 
germany said william veronda a fixedincome strategist at 
financial group a denver investment firm but with a more 
volatile flow of funds throughout the world now many investors 
stop and say gee the real return is much better there 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the government said record price increases for vegetables and 
fuel oil combined in january to produce a 18 percent rise in 
wholesale inflation the highest monthly rate in 15 years but 
economists were quick to characterize the rise as a temporary spurt 
due to the holiday cold snap 
more signs emerged of trouble in the airline business the 
government said the ontime performance of major carriers was the 
worst ever in december and a record number of bags were lost texas 
air corp reported a record annual loss of 8856 million 
moneylosing pan am corp dropped hints it still was seeking a 
merger partner and trans world airlines pilots snubbed owner carl 
icahns efforts to cut the carriers losses with wage concessions 
georgia was on the minds of woodcutters and federal securities 
officials a federal judges ruling made it much easier for georgia 
pacific corp in its 35 billion hostile attempt to buy great 
northern nekoosa corp takeover investor harold simmons said the 
securities and exchange commission was investigating his stock 
purchases in target georgia gulf corp

the treasury auction monkey is off the stock 
markets back but many observers say wall street still faces some 
rocky moments as it tries to sustain a recovery from its january 
lows 
they warn of potential corporate earnings shocks rising 
interest rates overseas may continue to make homegrown investments 
more attractive to foreigners and weakness in the dollar could cut 
foreign demand here as well 
on the plus side they say inflation appears to be under control 
despite a strong increase in wholesale prices in january the 
increase was blamed in large part on spikes in food and energy 
prices due to unusually cold weather 
and they say that the slowing economy may soon inspire declines 
in interest rates that will make stocks more attractive 
in a word analysts on both sides of the fence say the next few 
weeks will be bumpy 
getting the refunding behind us is positive for the market it 
takes away one of the negatives overhanging the market said 
thomas czech chairman of the investment committee at blunt ellis amp 
loewi in milwaukee 
the refunding auction which involved sales of 30 billion in 
new treasury notes and bonds had been nervously awaited by the 
stock market 
traders feared that rising rates in japan and other countries 
would diminish the foreign appetite for treasury issues forcing 
the government to offer even higher interest rates to sell all of 
the new issues 
but demand was strong for the threeyear and 10year notes and 
even a lukewarm reception for the 30year bonds didnt spoil the 
impression that the refunding had gone fairly well 
nonetheless having the refunding out of the way does now 
guarantee smooth sailing for either the stock or bond markets 
we have some other clouds to clear up here czech said 
he said the weak dollar has been bothering the stock market 
and has given no signs of bottoming out in addition he said 
disappointing earnings will be with us for a while hurting 
stock prices 
he expects the market to move in spurts in a trendless pattern 
over the next few weeks until we get a clear sign that inflation 
is receding 
we are still facing a market that was wounded in january 
said bill raftery a technical researcher for smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
he referred to a move that took the dow jones industrial average 
to a record high of 281015 on jan 2 and then sent it careening 
to a low of 254324 on jan 30 
the market has retraced about a third of the loss through 
fridays close but raftery noted it takes a long time to heal 
the wounds 
rao chalasani market strategist for prescott ball amp turben in 
cleveland expects rates to continue rising in west germany and 
japan as monetary officials there respond to signs of inflation 
in addition he said the firstquarter corporate earnings 
reports will be worse than the market anticipates 
he said the dow jones industrial average could fall to the 2400 
level in the spring before declining interest rates spark an 
economic pickup and provide a lift for stocks later in the year 
this past week the dow jones average of 30 industrials showed a 
net gain of 4550 to finish at 264820 by fridays close it was 
the second consecutive weekly advance as the dow jones average rose 
4347 the previous week 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index gained 164 to 18439 the nasdaq composite index 
for the overthecounter market was up 663 at 42884 and the 
american stock exchange market value index rose 723 to 36079 its 
strongest gain since rising 738 for the week ended sept 29 1989 
big board volume averaged 15498 million shares a day down from 
16909 million the previous week 
investment newsletter writers are in their most pessimistic mood 
about the markets prospects since june 1982 according to a survey 
by investors intelligence which studies about 130 newsletters a 
week in new rochelle ny 
editor michael burke said his latest report which covered the 
week ended last friday found that 573 percent of the nearly 130 
newsletters studied were bearish on prospects for the stock market 
the highest since 576 percent were bearish in june 1982 the 
report found 299 percent of the newsletters were bullish down 
from 560 percent in the week of dec 15 
of course some analysts view such reports as a contrarian 
signal that the market may be about to reverse direction 
when they get nervous people say sell very quickly they 
are pulling the trigger very quickly here burke said

as many as 200 atampt customers with tollfree 
800 numbers were left without service for nearly 1 hours friday 
the second time in a month the phone company has experienced a 
major service problem 
american telephone amp telegraph co blamed the latest problem on 
a maintenance error 
customers with 800 numbers followed by the digits 424 could not 
receive calls from 1240 pm est and 2 pm said atampt spokesman 
gary morgenstern 
he said as many as 200 business and agencies may have been 
affected but added that a precise figure was not available and 
that the number may have been smaller 
an 800 number is one which callers may call without incurring 
any charges 
one of the customers affected the federal internal revenue 
service reported its tollfree number 18004241040 was down in 
about half the the nation 
the entire eastern half of the country was involved as far as 
that tollfree situation said irs spokeswoman phyllis goodwin in 
newark i understand it has been taken care of 
she could not estimate the number of taxpayers seeking 
information that were unable to get through 
the outage occurred because of an error in a routine 
maintenance procedure morgenstern said someone failed to 
follow standard procedure while technicians were relocating some 
800 numbers from one network control point to another 
these routing changes were inadvertently omitted from one of 
the systems which guide network traffic he said 
he did not know where the technicians were working 
on jan 15 much of atampts longdistance network was down 
nationwide for nine hours due to a computer programming error in 
the networks call switching system 
the company has scheduled a special discount day feb 14 to make 
it up to long distance customers inconvenienced by the outage 
discounts of 33 percent off the regular daytime rate will be in 
effect between 8 am and 5 pm that day morgenstern said

the weekend 
the dollar was basically rangebound said richard alford a 
vice president of the continental bank of chicago 
the foreign exchange markets managed to take in stride a large 
18 percent increase in the producer price index during january 
economists noted the wholesale inflation reading was boosted by the 
severe cold snap in december excluding food and energy the ppi 
went up a barely perceptible 01 percent 
enthusiasm to invest heavily in marks was tempered by news that 
west german chancellor helmut kohl favors uniting the two germanys 
with a common currency 
dealers who had been buying marks aggressively on the 
assumption that the west german economy would benefit from the 
reforms in eastern europe adopted a more cautious approach there 
was uncertainty about what a possible merging of east and west 
germanys currencies would mean 
regardless dollar trading continued to be secondary to activity 
in marks british pounds japanese yen and swiss francs on world

the stock market posted a small gain friday 
drawing some mild encouragement from an inflation report and a 
decline in interest rates 
trading activity was sluggish 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose 428 points 
on thursday added another 383 points to close at 264820 
extending its gain for the week to 4550 points 
advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in

the market traded in a narrow range for most of the day opening

fading at the close 
before the market opened the government reported a steep 18 
percent rise in its producer price index in january the biggest 
onemonth increase in more than 15 years 
but analysts had been expecting a sharp rise as the holiday 
cold snap sent energy and food prices soaring discounting the food 
and energy increases inflation was lower than had been expected 
the report was viewed positively in the credit markets where 
bond prices rose as much as 10 for every 1000 in face value and 
shortterm interest rates fell by 6 to 7 basis points or 
hundredths of a percentage point 
some analysts say the completion of the treasurys 30 billion 
auction of new securities on thursday should take some of the 
pressure off stocks 
the auction ended with the sale of 10 billion in 30year bonds 
which received a less enthusiastic reception than the sales of 10 
billion in threeyear notes and a like amount of 10year notes 
earlier in the week 
but the analysts said the refunding as a whole went well 
avoiding the big spikes in rates that some traders had expected 
rising interest rates make yields on fixedincome securities 
more competitive with those on stocks reduce chances for corporate 
earnings growth and make it more expensive to borrow money to buy 
stocks

sales of 125 billion for 1989 next week up by about 14 billion

inventories are in line with production now although it may not 
stay that way for gm and chrysler 
were going to have to see how the market evolves greenwald 
said friday

near future but added these are things you have to stay loose 
and roll with 
on thursday ford north american sales vice president robert 
rewey had said i believe that the inventory correction that we 
planned was essentially completed at the end of january 
ford is the only one of the big three that has not announced a 
plant shutdown or largescale indefinite layoffs for 1990

and plans to close its car plant in st louis on sept 21 gm will 
close its lakewood car assembly plant in atlanta in midmarch

production rates at other plants resulting in indefinite layoffs 
also friday 
greenwald said some bids had been received for its chrysler 
technologies corp subsidiary and indicated that talks about 
selling the company which includes gulfstream aerospace inc were 
in late stages however he declined to discuss any details with 
reporters and said negotiations were at their most delicate stage

federal reserve policymakers decided at their 
december meeting to further ease their high interest rate policies 
due to the sluggish economy according to minutes released friday 
two days after the dec 1819 meeting the federal funds rate 
dropped from 85 percent to 825 percent the sixth quarter of a 
percentage point decline since the rate peaked at 975 percent in 
june 
federal funds the interest banks charge each other for 
overnight loans is the primary lever the fed uses to control 
shortterm interest rates it has not been adjusted since dec 21 
the central bank has kept interest rates relatively high for 
more than a year as it sought to decrease inflation by slowing the 
economy 
the gross national product the total output of goods and 
services declined from thirdquarter growth of 3 percent to just 
05 percent in the last three months of 1989 some government 
officials and business leaders have urged the fed to loosen its 
grip further to stimulate economic activity 
the federal open market committee as the policymaking body is 
called met again tuesday and wednesday to review monetary policy 
but minutes of that meeting will not be released until next month 
the committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to formulate 
monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed 
it is made up of the seven federal reserve board members and 
five of the 12 presidents of the fed district banks 
a majority indicated that on balance they viewed the risks of 
a shortfall in economic activity as sufficiently high to justify an 
immediate move to slightly easier reserve conditions and one 
member expressed a preference for somewhat greater easing the 
minutes of the december meeting said 
members who supported an unchanged policy were concerned 
that further easing might overcompensate for current weaknesses in 
the economy at the cost of delaying progress toward price 
stability the minutes stated 
in the end the vote to ease was 92 dissenting were govs 
wayne d angell and thomas c melzer one board governorship is 
vacant 
in arriving at their decision committee members reviewed 
information suggesting that economic activity was expanding slowly 
in the fourth quarter with sluggishness especially evident in the 
manufacturing sector the minutes read 
by contrast growth of the service sector appeared to be well 
sustained and overall construciton activity seemed relatively 
firm they continued 
however a fed staff projection suggested the economy would 
continue to slow over the next several quarters although it would 
rebound in the first quarter from the effects of fourthquarter 
strikes and natural disasters 
as it has in the past the committee agreed that its decision 
would be subject to further adjustment depending on subsequent 
economic developments

energy futures prices finished mixed friday 
with nearmonth contracts posting losses amid concern that 
petroleum supplies will exceed demand in the short term 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the main grade of crude oil fell 35 cents to 
2174 per 42gallon barrel the contract finished the week with a 
net loss of 128 a barrel 
crude oil for april lost 9 cents to 2156 a barrel while 
contracts for later delivery posted gains 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale 
unleaded gasoline for march delivery fell 161 cents to 5956 cents 
a gallon for a net weekly loss of 466 cents april closed 150 
lower at 6025 cents a gallon may was off 115 cents to 6425 
cents and other contracts had narrower declines 
march heating oil which lost 057 cent on thursday remained 
under pressure from warm weather in the northeast traders said 
the contract closed down 024 cent at 5508 cents a gallon later 
contracts finished higher april ended at 5462 cents up 021 
cent and may rose 061 cent to 5406 cents a gallon 
analysts said prices came under pressure from industry and 
government reports this week that showed an increase in crude and 
product supplies in the nations storage tanks the higher stocks 
coincide with lower seasonal demand 
crude prices also weakened on word that many big refineries 
would slow operations for their spring overhaul in the next few 
months which suggests a decline in demand for raw oil by refiners 
although this weeks reports by the american petroleum institute 
and department of energy showed that gasoline supplies were higher 
weektoweek but lower than last year analysts said there was no 
immediate cause to worry about possible supply tightness 
jack baker energy analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
called outlandish a news report friday that suggested a 
possible squeeze in motor fuel supplies this spring 
we have less inventories than last year but more than we had 
last april 1 and were making more said baker 
moreover annual maintenance turnarounds at refineries are being 
done in march and april earlier than last year and well ahead of 
the peak gasoline season analysts said refineries therefore are 
expected to be pumping plenty of gasoline in time to meet spring 
demand and environmental standards requiring lowerpolluting motor 
fuel analysts said

gibraltar financial corp has filed 
for protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy law 
nearly a year after regulators seized its main unit gibraltar 
savings 
gibraltar chairman james n thayer said the thrift holding 
company was forced to make the filing thursday to dissolve a claim 
against its assets by bank of america the trustee for the holders 
of 995 million in unsecured gibraltar bonds 
thayer also said the move was prompted in part by the 
governments seizure of two of the corporations savings and loan 
subsidiaries gibraltar savings and gibraltar savings bank fa 
in march 1989 
the filing which had been expected was made under chapter 11 
of the us bankruptcy code it gives gibraltar freedom from the 
threat of creditors lawsuits while trying to reorganize its 
business 
bank of america obtained a writ of attachment against 
gibraltars assets in november gibraltar was unable to make 
interest payments because federal regulators seized simi 
valleybased gibraltar savings march 31 declaring it insolvent 
the unit then didnt pay interest on debt it owed the parent 
company 
the company intends to continue its legal remedies against 
gibraltar savings and the federal regulators during the course of 
the chapter 11 case for the benefit of our creditors and 
stockholders thayer said in a statement 
gibraltar savings had 83 branches and the sister thrift had six 
branches in washington and 18 in florida together they had 88 
billion in deposits when seized 
gibraltar financial sued regulators last june demanding that 
gibraltar savings return about 11 million that the onetime parent 
company claims it is owed thayer who has been highly critical of 
the regulators continued his attack on them in his statement 
saying the bankruptcy filing would not have been necessary if 
gibraltar financial still ran the thrift 
while the writ of attachment was the proximate cause of 
todays action the chapter 11 filing also resulted from the 
federal regulators action in seizing gibraltar savings and 
gibraltar savings bank and the regulators failure to date to 
cause gibraltar savings to pay its debts to the company thayer 
said 
gibraltar financial lost 1005 million in 1988 and 1465 
million in 1987 in 1986 it had a 439 million profit the 
holding company whose stock is publicly traded has no significant 
assets other than its units in california and washington state

bond prices rose sharply friday rallying after 
the successful completion of the treasury departments 30 billion 
quarterly refunding auction 
the newly issued 30year government bond surged 1 2532 points 
or 1781 per 1000 in face amount from its level at thursdays 
auction its yield tumbled to 833 percent from 850 percent bond 
prices and yields move in opposite directions 
the jump in the price of the long bond the most widely watched 
of government securities was the largest since last oct 13 when 
it rose 2 916 points in response to a sharp selloff in the stock 
market 
credit market strategists attributed fridays large increase to 
two factors relief over the completion of the treasurys threeday 
auction this week and a government report indicating that wholesale 
inflation in january was low excluding volatile food and energy 
prices 
the government sold 10 billion each of threeyear notes 
10year notes and 30year bonds on tuesday wednesday and thursday 
the market had viewed the auctions with concern that low foreign 
buying would push yields up and prices down to stimulate interest 
the united states has come to depend on foreign investors 
particularly the japanese to help finance the federal deficit and 
pay interest on the total public debt 
instead the auction was completed successfully with adequate 
foreign interest propped up by strong domestic buying demand 
slackened only in the final leg the 30year bond 
theres a lot of relief the refunding is over and the auctions 
by and large went well at least better than expected at the 
beginning of the week said steven a wood money market 
economist with bankamerica capital markets group in san francisco 
in addition the credit markets were pleased with an increase of 
just 01 percent in wholesale inflation for january excluding a 
spurt in food and energy prices due to severe cold around the 
country 
overall the producer price index for janaury rose 18 percent 
the sharpest rise since 1974 but the core rate excluding food 
energy is viewed as a better measure of underlying inflationary 
pressure 
economists said the low core rate was interpreted to indicate 
that the federal reserve board would not likely raise interest 
rates to try to cool off the economy and curb increasing costs 
high inflation tends to erode prices of fixedincome securities 
such as bonds 
its now viewed the fed does not have to overreact to the 
energy and food situation and it can probably continue to hold 
policy pretty steady wood said 
in the secondary market for treasury securities prices of 
shortterm government issues rose lsqb point to 516 point 
intermediate maturities gained 1332 point to 2732 point and 
longterm issues climbed 2932 point to 1 point according to 
figures provided by telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer gained 652 to 116699 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 799 percent as the 
discount declined 6 basis points to 774 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills slipped to 807 percent as the discount lost 7 
basis points to 766 percent yields on oneyear bills declined to 
801 percent as the discount declined 7 basis points to 749 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 percent up from 8 316 
percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds closed at 92 up 916 point the average 
yield to maturity fell to 738 percent from 743 percent late

unsecured creditors of allied stores corp 
fell in line friday and dropped their objections to 1 billion in 
new financing for the cincinnatibased retailer 
lawyers for allied and for the creditors said they agreed to a 
compromise similar to the one forged thursday by federated 
department stores and its creditors committee the federated 
proposal is for 14 billion in financing 
both proposals have been submitted to us bankruptcy judge j 
vincent aug jr who is overseeing the chapter 11 reorganization of 
the two us retail divisions of torontobased campeau corp 
aug who heard nearly eight hours of testimony regarding 
federated on thursday and two hours friday regarding allied said 
the companys arguments on behalf of both financing proposals met 
minimum requirements but he said he would review the presentations 
before signing the orders 
officers of federated and allied testified that they negotiated 
the best deals possible and needed quick approval to meet a 
wednesday deadline set by the banks providing the financing 
federateds deal includes 400 million in operating capital and 
a 1 billion financing package allowing federated to sell credit 
card debts to a subsidiary federated credit corp the credit 
division wasnt among those campeau units that filed for chapter 11 
protection from creditors jan 15 
citibank of new york heads a 90bank group providing the 400 
million 
allieds deal is for 300 million in operating capital and 700 
million from selling receivables chemical bank of new york would 
provide the 300 million and citibank would provide the 700 
million 
its a very efficient way to finance receivables without it 
there would not be enough to pay our bills on time allied 
treasurer mark kennedy testified friday 
we believe its necessary to receive approval at this point in 
time we need to keep up the vendor confidence we have right now 
he said 
the unsecured creditors had objected contending that allied 
could operate a while longer without rushing into a loan agreement 
and argued that the banks would gain too much control by the 
conditions they put on the loans 
attorney lawrence gottlieb said the creditors committee would 
drop its objection in exchange for rewording of federateds 
proposed order to give greater protection to the trade creditors 
we have a great desire to work together we have a lot of 
vendors who do a lot of business with the debtor we just ask the 
debtor to work with us gottlieb said 
allied agreed to provide monthly financial reports on each 
division said laywers who continued to work out the final wording 
after the hearing aug called it a productive compromise 
i hope that talks do not break down for some unforeseen 
reason aug said 
federated and allied listed a total of 77 billion in debt when 
they filed for bankruptcy protection 
the two retailers employ about 100000 people and operate 260 
stores in nine chains abraham and straus and bloomingdales of new 
york burdines of miami lazarus of cincinnati and richs of 
atlanta in the federated group and the bon marche of seattle 
jordan marsh of boston maas brothers of tampa and sterns of

the deteriorating condition of the 
east german economy crippled by a daily drain of 1800 people 
leaving for the west has heightened concern among officials but 
both german governments denied friday that collapse is imminent 
a top official in chancellor helmut kohls government speaking 
privately said earlier friday the decline fueled by worker exodus 
widespread strikes and high absenteeism at many industrial sites 
has accelerated to the point that insolvency could be within a 
few days 
kohl will discuss the need for immediate aid in the billions 
of marks dollars for east german neighbors during his weekend 
visit to moscow said the senior official 
but bonn government spokesman hans klein issued a statement 
later in the day saying bonn was not officially predicting an east 
german collapse 
the federal government is not of the opinion that east germany 
in the next days will be insolvent klein said but noted that 
some individual leaders fear such extreme possibilities 
a spokesman for east germanys communist government of premier 
hans modrow denied the nation of 16 million residents is in such 
dire circumstances 
as long as the modrow government exists east germany will 
remain solvent spokesman wolfgang meyer told reporters in east 
berlin 
the senior kohl official also said east germanys firstever 
free elections set for march 18 are threatened by the economic 
disaster 
certain state offices dont exist any more there are those in 
east germany who doubt that the march election date can even be 
reached the official said the situation cannot be assessed 
dramatically enough 
an accelerated decline would likely send more fleeing to west 
germany which is finding it hard to absorb hundreds of thousands 
of east germans many of them craftsmen who already have fled 
seeking a better life 
kohl on wednesday formed a cabinet committee charged with 
working out unification of the two german states including 
immediate efforts to make the west german mark the common currency 
in an effort to stabilize east germanys economy the east german 
currency is virtually worthless outside the country 
since the october ouster of hardline communist leader erich 
honecker and the november opening of the berlin wall reunification 
has become a major issue of debate west germany with 61 million 
residents has tried to dismiss fears that a single germany would 
endanger the rest of europe 
in an address in the east german city of potsdam west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher proposed the two german 
states jointly agree to issue border guarantees to their neighbors 
and renounce possession of atomic weapons as a prelude to unity 
the communist officials still running the east german government 
have reacted coolly to kohls currency union offer as it hinges on 
wholesale adoption of market economics 
but east german economics minister christa luft said modrow 
would discuss the proposal when he visits bonn next week 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl met with reporters earlier 
friday and emphasized the positive aspects of monetary union 
although he had said after an east berlin visit three days earlier 
that it was far too early to introduce hard currency to east 
germany 
economic union with east germany will mean major sacrifices for 
both populations poehl acknowledged but he pointed to west 
germans prosperity and glowing economic forecasts in arguing that 
bonn could afford such a bailout 
poehl made clear that he has strong doubts about the timing and 
pace of the monetary union proposed by kohl and said he was 
surprised that the chancellor announced the plan without 
talking to the central bank first 
economists are predicting higher interest rates and taxes for 
west germans but poehl said there is no cause for alarm

two major credit rating agencies on friday downgraded the debt 
of farley inc and westpoint pepperell inc citing farleys 
difficulties in completing financing for its 3 billion acquisition 
standard amp poors corp said in downgrading 114 billion of 
farley debt that the outlook for the chicagobased company remains 
negative separately moodys investors service inc downgraded 
about 96 million in longterm debt of west point gabased 
pepperell and its subsidiary jp stevens amp co 
the rating actions reflect an increasingly strained financial 
position precipitated by farleys apparent inability to date to 
finance the purchase of the remainder of westpoint pepperells 
common stock sampp said in a statement 
the new yorkbased credit rating agency said the problem has 
hampered farleys ability to fund the purchase permanently sampp 
said the situation threatens the viability of the entire group of 
companies unless refinanced 
sampp noted that the pending sale of pepperells cluett peabody 
unit has been delayed for several months and the purchase price 
has been reduced by 170 million to 430 million 
sampp lowered farleys subordinated debt ratings to triple c and 
the senior debt of pepperell to single b minus the service also 
lowered its rating for other farley and pepperell subsidiaries 
including fruit of the loom 
moodys said it downgraded the debt ratings of pepperell and 
jp stevens to caa from baa3 because of high leverage from the 
acquisition of pepperell as well as the companys inability to 
quickly dispose of assets as plannned 
moodys believes that the flat retail environment will make it 
exceedingly difficult for westpoint to sufficiently increase 
returns on its operations to adequately support the debt the new 
york agency said 
farley acquired pepperell early last year after a fierce battle 
with the west pointbased textile companys management

the picture for floridas ravaged citrus 
industry brightened just a bit friday when agricultural 
statisticians projected a slightly better orange crop than in their 
first postfreeze analysis 
the us agriculture department revised its january figures 
upward by 8 million boxes of early and midseason oranges putting 
the overall orange total at 100 million boxes for the 198990 crop 
year 
if the projection holds up floridas orange crop will still be 
onethird lower than the 1466 million boxes produced last season 
said officials of the usdas florida agricultural statistics 
service in orlando 
before the christmas weekend freeze the current years orange 
harvest had been projected at 130 million 90pound boxes the 
statefederal crop inspectors said after the freeze that this could 
be slashed 29 percent to 92 million boxes the smallest estimated 
production in 25 years 
but fridays more optimistic forecast said the orange crop 
reduction from the prefreeze forecast may be 23 percent or 100 
million boxes 
the estimated juice yield was decreased to 129 gallons from the 
130 gallons for each box of oranges projected last month 
citrus statistician paul n messenger of the orlando office said 
analysts originally compared the christmas freeze to the one in 
1983 because they had been so similar in temperatures and duration 
the time of year and the amount of the crop on the trees 
the 1983 freeze reduced the orange crop by 30 percent 
it is apparent that the early and mids did not have as great a 
loss as they did in the 83 freeze messenger said another 
reason for the slight upward revision in the forecast is the good 
salvage operations of the crop he said 
utilization of freezedamaged fruit has exceeded expectations 
of the first postfreeze forecast in january the usda report 
said 
harvesting and processing of the icebitten fruit is about 90 
percent complete with only a few southern areas remaining to be 
picked in the states 700000acre citrus belt 
the nowripening valencia orange crop forecast was unchanged 
from januarys projection of 32 million boxes 
seedless grapefruitharvest projections dropped even further 
however from a figure of 355 million boxes right after the freeze 
to 325 million last years production was 51 million boxes 
messenger said there had been few reports of tree damage but 
extensive evaluation will not be made until this summer 
most of the trees are coming out very well with new growth 
and new bloom said messenger 
but he and growers say such new growth makes trees vulnerable to 
any further cold weather 
some industry officials have estimated financial losses at the 
farm level at 200 million to 300 million this does not include 
loss of added value from harvesting and processing

expense this courts integrity will not be flouted by mr 
antar or anybody else politan issued the repatriation order at 
the request of the securities and exchange commission which says 
the money may constitute illegal profits from insider trading 
the sec sued antar who was chairman of crazy eddie and other 
top former officials of the chain accusing them of falsely 
inflating the companys income the sec said antar transferred 52 
million to bank accounts in israel three years ago 
antar through his lawyers has denied the charges 
antars attorneys late friday sought recourse from to 3rd us 
circuit court of appeals judge robert e cowen in trenton 
cowen stayed the repatriation order and contempt finding but let 
the arrest warrant stand said antars attorney jack arseneault 
the effect is that antar needs only to appear in court to remove 
the threat of arrest while a formal appeal of the repatriation 
order goes forward he said 
politan had set a deadline of 4 pm wednesday for the money to 
be returned and deposited with a trustee when antar defied it he 
ordered him to court thursday morning to respond to the contempt 
citation 
antars lawyers said he needed a 24hour extension for personal 
reasons politan granted the delay with the threat of an arrest 
warrant if antar failed to appear friday 
in an affidavit submitted friday antar said he was refusing the 
order because of his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination antars attorneys have argued that merely 
acknowledging the presence of the money could be used against him 
politan spurned the offer of the affidavit 
were not in a paper chase here were in a human chase human 
beings have a right to pursue a privilege but they cant do 
it by affidavit he said 
the us attorneys office in newark is seeking a criminal 
indictment against the brooklyn nyborn antar a high school 
dropout who turned a single electronics store into a chain of 43 
crazy eddie became widely known in the new york area for its 
frenetic commercials advertising insane prices 
the company has entered bankruptcy proceedings and is facing a 
shareholders lawsuit 
politan refused arseneaults request for a stay on the arrest 
order pending appeal he then closed the courtroom to ask antars 
lawyers for his recent addresses and phone numbers and his 
whereabouts the last time he spoke to his lawyers

whirlpool corp announced friday it 
will close its dishwasher plant here that employs 650 people by 
march 1991 
its going to hurt everybody said united auto workers local 
1562 steward frankie allen everyones going to suffer 
you cant find another job like that here and certainly not 
that many said bob teegarden who has worked at the plant 22 
years 
whirlpool also announced it will sell its danville plant and its 
floorcare operations but will move the plants icemaker and 
trash compactor operation to other plants 
the danville plant which opened 19 years ago has more than 
1000 workers 700 in the floorcare division that manufactures 
kenmore vacuum cleaners and 300 in the making of icemakers and 
trash compactors 
david mitchell vice president of the danville division said at 
a news conference friday that whirlpool is optimistic it can find a 
buyer for the plants floorcare operations preserving 700 jobs 
we have over 10 percent of the floorcare business nationally 
and we have an outstanding facility and employees mitchell said 
however mitchell said most of the 300 jobs in the icemaker and 
trashcompactor operation will be lost 
whirlpool said it will shift production of its kitchenaid 
dishwashers from mount sterling to its division in findlay ohio 
which already makes whirlpool roper and kenmore dishwashers and 
whirlpool cooking ranges 
production of builtin cooking appliances will be moved from 
findlay to whirlpools oxford miss plant which makes builtin 
cooking products as well as components for whirlpool and kitchenaid 
whirlpool officials said the company could save 7 million by 
moving operations to findlay 
tom reffett president of local 1562 said the union was willing 
to make concessions in its current contract to keep the plant open 
i dont think anything we could have done would have 
mattered said reffett who had worked at the plant for 18 years 
reffett said in small town like mount sterling with about 6000 
residents it would be impossible to replace the jobs at the plant 
which paid an average of 972 an hour 
william d marohn executive vice president of whirlpools north 
american appliance group said the moves would improve 
manufacturing efficiency and focus on the companys major appliance 
businesses 
clearly these were not easy decisions to make since they 
affect a number of our people marohn said we believe they are 
the right ones for the companys north american business long 
term 
the mount sterling plant will operate at least through the 
fourth quarter of 1990 and close by the end of the first quarter 
of 1991 whirlpool spokeswoman carol sizer said 
some management jobs may be transferred to other whirlpool 
facilities but most employees will be dismissed sizer said 
the company will schedule meetings with united auto workers 
local 1562 to negotiate the dismissal procedures she said

the 1700 appalachia coal miners who have been 
on strike since april on friday moved closer to a vote on returning 
to work as the national labor relations board settled lawsuits 
filed by both sides during the bitter dispute 
bargainers for the united mine workers and pittston coal co 
reached a tentative settlement on new years eve but a contract 
ratification vote for rankandfile union members in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky has been delayed until outstanding unfair 
labor practice charges were resolved 
a umw spokesman said it was unclear when miners who have 
remained off the job pending ratification would vote on the new 
contract 
under fridays nlrb agreement both sides will be allowed to 
drop all charges if the contract is ratified miners return to work 
and the terms of the agreement are approved by federal courts 
also friday the umw said it and the company would go before 
russell county va circuit judge donald mcglothlin on monday to 
ask that he drop 645 million in fines levied against the union 
for illegal strike activities such as intimidating replacement 
workers and obstructing coal truck traffic 
in big stone gap va us district judge glen williams also 
must settle nearly 1 million in fines against the union as a 
condition of ratification 
williams held a 90minute closeddoor meeting in his chambers 
friday afternoon with two attorneys each from the union and the 
board after the session williams told reporters he was concerned 
about possible public reaction were he to issue a blanket 
forgiveness of the fines 
i naturally dont want to do something thats going to block a 
settlement williams said adding that he was nonetheless 
interested in protecting the integrity of the court 
williams said he probably would meet again with union attorneys 
monday 
in addition trustees of the unions health retirement funds 
also must agree to changes required by the new contract 
details of the contract remain secret but sources have said the 
union won on two key issues better health and retirement benefits 
and improved job security 
the union struck after pittston decided to end contributions to 
the umw retirement and health plans for some 130000 workers the 
union said the decision could cause other coal companies to follow 
suit and retired miners would lose their benefits 
pittston the nations largest coal exporter said it could not 
afford the payments because of high overseas shipping costs 
the strike was punctuated by large labor rallies vandalism and 
rockthrowing confrontations between strikers and other company 
workers at one point some 46000 coal workers in 10 states walked 
off their jobs in sympathy strikes

the younger brother of ernest and julio 
gallo owners of the worlds largest winery has filed a federal 
appeal renewing his claim to a onethird interest in the 1 
billionayear business and arguing to use the family name on his 
cheese products 
livingston rancher joseph gallo said in his 59page filing 
before the us 9th circuit court of appeals that the first 
amendment entitles him to use the gallo name on his cheese and 
that his older brothers used his inheritance to launch the gallo 
wine empire 
the filing made last month is an appeal of a decision by us 
district judge robert e coyle last august it held that josephs 
use of the gallo name on his cheese packages violated the eampj gallo 
trademark he ordered joseph to reduce the gallo emphasis on 
labels and in ads 
joseph appealed to coyle asking for a new judge and a new 
trial coyle denied the motions joseph then launched his claim in 
the inheritance matter joseph alleged that his brothers once 
included him as an equal partner 
the stakes are huge eampj gallo reputedly packs about 170 million 
gallons of wine annually dominating the california wine industry 
and controlling more than 25 percent of the us wine market 
josephs claim was dismissed by us district judge edward dean 
price who had removed himself from the trademark case over a 
challenge of the judges relationship with the gallos 
the new appeal charges that coyle had a conflict in the 
trademark case because he owned vineyards in fresno county and was 
a partner in a law firm that represented the winery in an earlier 
trademark case 
joseph among other things asked the appeals court to knock 
down coyles ruling and order a new trial with a different judge

federal regulators took over the nearly 
1 billion american federal savings and loan association of des 
moines on friday over concern that it could not meet its capital 
requirements 
officials said it was the largest failure ever of an iowa thrift 
no depositor lost any money and all accounts remain federally 
insured said jerry orman of the federal office of thrift 
supervision

deposit at offices in 14 iowa communities 
the federal resolution trust corp seized all deposits named a 
managing agent to supervise operations and said the thrift would 
reopen saturday as american federal savings association of iowa

were going to be unable to meet their capital requirements without 
some form of government assistance orman said 
he said the thrifts liabilities exceed its assets by 28 
million 
the resolution trust corp and office of thrift supervision were 
set up by congress as part of a multibilliondollar program to 
salvage failed thrifts 
this would be by far the biggest takeover in iowa said 
gregg barcus the superintendent of the state savings and loan 
division

operate while the resolution trust corp seeks to minimize losses 
and insure prudent operations the government also will try to seek 
a buyer 
a resolution trust corp managing agent jerry brandt was put 
in charge of the thrift but orman said no other management changes 
were anticipated 
orman said american federal had been experiencing operating 
losses over several years as a result of outofstate problem loans

the jobs almost all of them in management will be eliminated 
by the end of march the company said additional reductions will 
take place over the next two years as part of the streamlining 
effort 
officials said the announcement made thursday was unrelated to 
the defense departments proposal to eliminate the m1 tank 
textron said late last month that the proposal could lead to 1500 
layoffs for the stratfordbased company which employs 4300 
textron said at the time it has been trying for the last four

a food and drug administration proposal to 
limit food health claims was praised friday as a major victory 
for consumers but one industry group called portions of the plan 
a bureaucratic nightmare 
allen goldberg of the grocery manufacturers association praised 
the fda for moving ahead on health claims but said the plan was 
unacceptable in its current form 
he called a requirement for fda clearance of health claims a 
bureaucratic nightmare and said the need for scientific agreement 
on a health benefit before a claim can be made is unfair 
scientific consensus is an oxymoron he said we believe a 
claim should be able to be made if strong scientific evidence 
exists to support the claim 
another industry group the national food processors 
association also said it had some concerns but spokeswoman ellen 
morton said overall our reaction is pretty positive 
the groups major complaint is that the plan will let states 
regulate health claims which could lead to different rules in 
different states our members market their products on an 
interstate basis she said 
the policy will allow some health claims to be made but will 
end what even federal officials say has been three years under 
rules that have allowed overly broad and illfounded claims 
the rule is a major victory for consumers and responsible 
members of the food industry said bruce silverglade of the 
center for science in the public interest 
this new regulation probably means the end of claims that oat 
bran doughnuts reduce cholesterol that vitamin a in butter keeps 
your skin soft and smooth and that b vitamins in cereals help 
provide energy 
the proposal is to be published in the federal register next 
week 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said in 
announcing the plan friday that it is a midcourse correction 
of regulations that have allowed food sellers to make health claims 
since 1987 when the reagan administration abandoned a 
longstanding prohibition against such claims 
only with such a consistent set of standards can americans be 
sure of the meaning of health information on food labels he said 
the fdas proposal would let companies make specific health 
claims if the claims fall within a narrow range of messages 
concerning the relationship between diet and health benefits 
the principle reference points for scientific backup to the 
claims would be studies by the us surgeon general and the 
national academy of sciences claims outside that narrow range 
would be allowed only in certain circumstances 
sullivan said that as science finds more links between diet and 
health the regulation could be updated 
the policy will allow health claims about fiber and colon 
cancer fiber and heart disease fats and cancer fats and heart 
disease sodium and high blood pressure and calcium and 
osteoporosis a softening of the bones sometimes found in the 
elderly 
the american heart association whose program of special heart 
healthy labels on foods has been sharply criticized by the fda 
said the new regulation was welcome but does not address all of 
the important nutrition issues facing the american public 
the association said it was trying to address how individual 
foods fit in to a healthy diet reformulation of foods to 
eliminate excessive amounts of harmful substances independent 
testing and availability of accurate information in the supermarket 
despite predictions that the rules could enable the fda to act 
against a proliferation of claims about oat bran because recent 
studies have thrown doubt its benefits the proposal doesnt worry 
quaker oats co 
we have 27 years of research showing that oatmeal and oat bran 
when consumed in connection with a low fat diet will lower 
cholesterol said luther mckinney a senior vice president for 
law and corporate affairs 
but while the company is happy the rules have been issued 
mckinney said he was concerned about a provision that would allow 
states to impose more stringent rules on health claims 
texas is suing quaker oats over the companys 
cholesterollowering claim for one of its products 
the new policy could take a year to be fully implemented until 
then claims will be considered on a casebycase basis
