george bush is the overwhelming yet uneasy 
leader in the race for the white house as the presidential campaign 
enters its final week with michael dukakis making late gains that 
have democrats dreaming of a comeback according to an associated 
press survey of the 50 states 
the survey shows bush leading in states with 359 electoral 
votes even though he has not yet locked up the 270 that would 
assure him of victory dukakis total is far smaller 78 votes 
nine states with 101 electoral votes are tossups illinois 
pennsylvania and wisconsin among them 
the ap survey indicates bush has maintained republican strength 
in the south and rocky mountain west while dukakis has failed to 
accomplish the same in the industrial states the survey was based 
on polls as well as interviews with politicians and political 
analysts around the country 
were spending all our time in states that should be his 
dukakis base and hes spending none of his time in states 
that should be our base says top bush strategist lee atwater 
thats a campaign managers dream 
yet democrats said a latecampaign surge has brought dukakis to 
within striking distance in states such as california ohio and 
texas and said he has gained elsewhere as well 
dukakis is clearly behind but i think hes closing the gap 
said michigan sen don riegle theres still a lot of people who 
havent made up their minds riegle is expected to win an easy 
reelection himself and says i think the democrats can still 
win nationally 
the candidates will spend much of the final nine days in states 
such as california ohio michigan illinois pennsylvania and 
ohio and atwater claimed if we win any one of them george bush 
will be elected 
that assumes bush holds texas where democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen is camping out in hopes of a 
homestate upset 
democrats in several key states say dukakis more aggressive 
latecampaign style presents opportunities for a turnaround and 
has given lifelong democrats a reason to take a second look at the 
race theres a lot of movement out there said francis 
obrien an adviser to the massachusetts governor 
republicans and democrats alike say bush forged his lead on his 
ability to depict dukakis as an unreconstructed liberal dukakis 
recent improvement is attested to by private polling in both 
parties and laid in part to dukakis recent populist campaigning 
and perhaps a process of loyal democrats coming home as the 
nov 8 election approaches 
in television interviews last week dukakis attempted to portray 
his views and his values while lambasting bush and the republicans 
for distorting his record as governor of massachusetts bush 
confidently turned down network interview requests before agreeing 
to appear on morning talk shows this week 
what michael dukakis failed to do after the democratic 
convention was define who he is and what he was going to do said 
pat shea cochairman of the democratic campaign in utah 
the thing i fear most is complacency said keith mcnamara 
bushs chairman in ohio a key state where republicans have poured 
resources and staked bush to a lead 
several nationwide polls including recent private soundings for 
both campaigns give bush a national advantage in the range of 
eight to 10 points but when translated to the electoral college 
bushs advantage grows 
the ap survey showed that bush has built a solid core of support 
in the customarily republican regions of the south and rocky 
mountain west his lead in states such as arizona florida and 
nevada could be as high as 20 to 30 points 
bush also leads in several key battleground states including 
ohio texas california new jersey and michigan but party 
surveys over the past several days suggest nationwide gains for 
dukakis 
other key states are tossups including illinois wisconsin 
pennsylvania missouri vermont oregon washington and montana 
among more traditionally democratic states maryland is tilting 
in bushs favor dukakis appears to have a solid lead in homestate 
massachusetts although his campaign has decided to air radio 
advertisements to firm up his support he also is rated the narrow 
favorite in democratic new york and in republican iowa 
despite the improvement the ap survey indicated that dukakis 
has failed to establish anything resembling a solid democratic core 
of support and state after state that appeared strong for him 
during the summer and early fall has moved into or closer to bushs 
column 
i know bush has got the inside track right now and i dont 
know if we can turn that around or not said kentucky house 
speaker don blandford 
bush is running extremely strong in the south 
its well over university of virginia political analyst 
larry sabato said in words describing his own state but which also 
apply to the region 
the reagan democrats have become bush democrats said 
louisiana pollster susan howell unless dukakis and the louisiana 
democrats can call the bush democrats home in the last week 
louisiana will be won for the republicans by white democrats voting 
for george bush 
by region 
bush has been leading in california the nations biggest 
state with 47 electoral votes although there as elsewhere 
democrats claim late gains and a formidable organization designed 
to maximize their vote 
oregon and washington are tossups while the remainder of the 
west is in bushs column according to the survey however bush 
visited montana and south dakota last week in a bid to protect them 
from the democrats and dukakis appears to have closed the gap in 
colorado 
in the midwest iowa and minnesota are leaning in dukakis 
direction but are far from secure while the democrat has lost his 
edge in wisconsin now a tossup bush is highly favored in the 
remainder of the farm belt 
the industrial midwest includes states that figured to decide a 
close election bushs lead has narrowed in ohio where democratic 
chairman james ruvolo insisted last week dukakis had a chance to 
win the vice president also leads in michigan 
illinois is close while missouri the weakest state for bush 
in his super tuesday primary sweep is a tossup 
the northeast traditionally a strong democratic region has 
the most close races providing a good barometer on how well bush 
has carried the fight new york aside both sides claim an 
advantage in pennsylvania 
dukakis home region of new england may even prove to be a land 
of opportunity for bush according to the survey he is regarded as 
the prohibitive favorite in new hampshire and appears to be 
leading in connecticut and maine 
vermont is rated a tossup and democrats say they will carry 
rhode island even though recent polls produce contradictory results

sen daniel patrick moynihan isnt running for 
reelection hes walking 
the new york democrat is far ahead in the polls has campaign 
money to burn and is facing littleknown lawyer robert mcmillan 
who has barebones support from his own republican party 
if moynihan is worried about anything in this campaign its 
breaking the record he set when he ran in 1982 that year running 
against florence sullivan a brooklyn assemblywoman moynihan 
carried 50 of new yorks 62 counties the first democrat to do so 
since martin van buren 
i lost orleans county by just six votes he said recently 
still sounding galled 
indeed moynihan hasnt had a bruising campaign since the 1976 
democratic primary when he went headtohat with bella abzug whom 
he beat by 10000 votes out of 916000 cast 
ask moynihan today what he thinks of mcmillan and he says 
which one 
at first you think hes kidding then he reaches into his back 
pocket and pulls out his wallet which contains a laminated card on 
which are typed the names of the six candidates running for his 
seat among them is a james p mcmillen the candidate of the 
libertarian party the others are running on even more obscure 
lines ranging from the independent progressive to the workers 
world parties 
asked again what he thinks of bob mcmillan moynihan says only 
hes running a very negative campaign 
mcmillan has called moynihan a liar and incompetent accused him 
of being a lousy boss who presides over a chaotic office and 
charged that the senators morals are mixed up moynihans 
response has been no response at all a sober tactic he credits to 
his wife elizabeth who is running his campaign 
moynihan heads into the final week of the campaign with a 
seemingly unassailable lead in the polls as he seeks a third term 
in congress a survey released last week by the marist college 
institute for public opinion showed moynihan ahead 67 percent to 20 
percent with 13 percent undecided 
his campaign is just the untouchable campaign said campaign 
spokesman lawrence odonnell jr there are several campaigns like 
that around the country and his is one it cant be hurt by 
anything 
moynihans overwhelming advantage has been virtually unchanged 
for months as mcmillans underfunded and underpublicized campaign 
has never really gotten on track 
where do we stand we stand still under that heavy rock weve 
been pushing uphill for the past several months mcmillan 
campaign spokesman robert allen said weve got only one way to 
go thats up

the new york times and the star tribune of minneapolis endorsed 
democrat michael dukakis for president in their sunday editions 
while republican george bush picked up support from the denver post 
and the seattle postintelligencer 
the st paul minn pioneer press dispatch meanwhile endorsed 
both candidates saying its editorial board was divided on which 
would make the better president 
the times said the most urgent job for the next president will be 
getting america out of hock from the reagan administration 
deficits 
whos likely to do it better the answer tips a closely 
balanced scale to michael dukakis the new york newspaper said 
it credited the vice president with being the clear winner as 
far as running an effective campaign but in evaluating the 
candidates experience and personality it said bushs selection of 
sen dan quayle of indiana as a running mate was a blunder that 
for this test forces a clear preference for mr dukakis 
on the issues the times said bush merits the edge on foreign 
policy questions while dukakis at least recognizes that national 
security depends on economic strength 
the new york newspaper said both candidates are better men than 
the images that have been projected in a sour superficial 
misleading campaign and that america is likely to be well served 
if either man is elected 
the denver paper complained that both bush and dukakis were 
presenting their worst faces to the american people 
it concluded americans are forced to choose between two good 
men running two bad campaigns after wiping away the mud from both 
candidates the post believes george bush is the better choice 
despite saying its enthusiasm for the democratic candidate had 
waned during the campaign the philadelphia inquirer endorsed 
dukakis 
mr dukakis shortcomings as a campaigner to be sure raise 
legitimate concerns about his ability to inspire people as 
president which is why our enthusiasm has waned the paper said 
in sundays editions even so on the basis of who he is what 
hes done and where hes likely to lead us mr dukakis remains the 
better bet 
meawhile bush picked up backing from the detroit news 
he may not be an ideal candidate but in our opinion hes far 
and away the better of the two the newspaper said 
the sunday oregonian of portland ore the states largest 
newspaper also backed the gop nominee 
the seattle postintelligencer wrote of the vice president 
while we disagree with a number of george bushs approaches to 
national problems we believe him to be an intelligent and competent 
man who will work diligently on behalf of the nations most vital 
interests 
it said the high point of the dukakis campaign was the democratic 
nominees acceptance speech in atlanta in july but since then it 
has been mostly downhill 
the star tribune headlined its endorsement for president 
narrowly michael dukakis 
the editorial said questions about the presidential qualities 
of each candidate have grown voters are left to guess which if 
elected could provide better answers over the long run our guess 
is michael dukakis 
the st paul paper meanwhile said that contributing to the 
dilemma of its divided eightmember editorial board was a sense of 
profound disgust about the negative tone of this campaign 
its not that both george bush and michael dukakis are 
unacceptable the pioneer press dispatch said what is closer to 
the truth is that we find ourselves divided on who would make the 
better president 
also sunday kentuckys two largest papers the courierjournal 
of louisville and the lexington heraldleader endorsed dukakis in 
florida the orlando sentinel and the miami herald endorsed bush 
while the daytona beach newsjournal praised dukakis

emperor hirohito discharged the largest amount of 
blood through the night since he fell ill last month forcing 
doctors to administer an emergency transfusion a palace spokesman 
said sunday 
the 87yearold emperor suffered his largest discharge since 
falling ill and received 294 pints of blood in a single emergency 
transfusion lasting until sunday morning kenji maeda imperial 
household agency spokesman told reporters 
what we had feared occurred maeda quoted chief court 
physician akira takagi as saying but he added that doctors were 
able to deal with the crisis and had returned to normal procedures 
maeda did not say how much blood the monarch lost but the 
discharge and transfusion are the largest since the ailing monarch 
vomited blood sept 19 and was given 086 pints immediately after 
maeda said the emperor began bleeding from his bowels at about 9 
pm 8 am edt saturday but that as of 10 am sunday 9 pm 
edt saturday the discharges subsided he added that the emperors 
systolic blood pressure plummeted to less than 100 for a short 
time but that hirohito was not in shock and remains conscious 
by sunday morning the emperor was awake and resting maeda said 
the transfusions brought the total amount of blood hirohito has 
received in the 42 days that he has been bedridden to 307 pints 
maeda also said palace doctors believed that along with blood 
which had accumulated in hirohitos abdomen some of the discharge 
was from fresh internal bleeding from the area of the upper 
intestine where he underwent bypass surgery last year 
palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports 
that the emperor has cancer 
hirohito the worlds oldest living monarch is being fed 
intravenously and has not eaten any food except for a few spoonfuls 
of porridge since the onset of the crisis

former philippines first lady imelda 
marcos arrived here saturday night for a brief stopover on her way 
to new york where she is scheduled to be arraigned on racketeering 
charges 
the private jet carrying mrs marcos landed at 955 pm pdt at 
the san jose jet center a facility for private aircraft at the san 
jose international airport 
mrs marcos disembarked and was led away by a police motorcade to 
an undisclosed location earlier government officials said they 
expected mrs marcos to visit her daughter irene araneta in san 
francisco 
the jet was being refueled and was scheduled to depart at 3 am 
pst sunday officials at the jet center said 
earlier saturday in honolulu mrs marcos had invited federal 
officials to join her on the borrowed luxury jet to prove she would 
not flee rather than fly to new york for arraignment on racketeering 
charges 
mrs marcos arrived at the honolulu airport in a black limousine 
and got aboard the plane without any comment to reporters she was 
accompanied by an entourage of about 10 people 
before leaving for the airport mrs marcos kissed and hugged her 
husband former philippines president ferdinand marcos who was 
brought out of the couples hillside estate in a wheelchair 
both were seen wiping away tears in the parting that was video 
recorded by marcos aides 
there are rumors that once airborne and out of radar range i 
might flee out of the united states mrs marcos said in a 
statement issued late friday in order to assure everybody of our 
destination i am inviting the fbi federal aviation administration 
and the ins immigration and naturalization service to have their 
men accompany us in the plane 
but a us attorney said the government trusted her to appear for 
mondays hearing 
john bartko a marcos attorney flew to honolulu early saturday 
so he would be with mrs marcos for her first trip out of hawaii 
since being exiled here nearly three years ago 
thats why i came so we could do everything to assure the us 
government she will be there bartko said any apprehension 
about her not meeting her legal obligation is totally unfounded 
mrs marcos and her husband were indicted oct 21 on charges that 
they looted more than 100 million from their country and used it to 
buy new york real estate artwork and other objects 
defense lawyers persuaded us district judge john f keenan that 
marcos 71 was too frail to make the long flight his arraignment 
was postponed at least until a government physician examines him 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after a militarycivilian 
revolt catapulted corazon aquino to power ending marcos 20year 
rule 
defense lawyers said mrs marcos 59 would plead innocent 
us attorney dan bent said no federal officials would escort 
mrs marcos on the private boeing 737300 in a luxury configuation 
for just 19 passengers that tobacco heiress doris duke loaned for 
the 5000mile trip 
until she does otherwise we must assume mrs marcos will 
appear as summoned bent said he refused to say how prosecutors 
would ensure her plane would not stray 
in new york suites were booked at the waldorfastoria hotel for 
the marcos entourage which includes a nurse secretary lawyers and 
several friends trinidad said 
i am grateful to the members of the filipinoamerican community 
in new york and surrounding areas for their concern for my privacy 
and security said mrs marcos at the same time they insist i 
stay at the waldorf astoria at their own expense to all of them a 
million thanks 
although marcos aides refused to detail mrs marcos plans in new 
york an associate said she planned to shop and entertain old 
friends 
as philippine first lady mrs marcos was known for her lavish 
parties at the waldorf and elsewhere in new york city but bartko 
said she now has other concerns 
her real concern is that she also hasnt left her husbands 
side for three years and shes very concerned about his health 
bartko said shes going to meet her legal obligation but i just 
dont see her having a gay old time in new york city 
indicted with the marcoses was saudian arabian financier adnan 
khashoggi who is accused of acting as a front for marcos to help 
divert assets and hide his ownership of real estate and art no 
court date for his appearance was scheduled

transfusion to emperor hirohito on sunday evening to battle an 
alarming drop in his blood pressure a palace spokesman said 
after the transfusion hirohitos blood pressure rose to 120 
over 50 from the dangerously low 84 over 34 level in the early 
evening the spokesman said 
a systolic blood pressure of under 100 for a sustained period of

a single spitfire from the battle of britain 
memorial flight flew over st clement danes church sunday as queen 
mother elizabeth unveiled a statue to world war ii hero lord 
dowding 
dowding who died in 1970 at age 88 was commander in chief of 
the fighter command throughout the battle of britain but was never 
honored with an official statue 
it is a matter of surprise and concern or perhaps even shame 
that no memorial has been raised said air chief marshal sir 
christopher foxleynorris chairman of the battle of britain 
fighter association 
the statue outside st clement danes the royal air force 
church on londons famed strand was paid for by many former pilots 
and by a public appeal 
but for his victory the war would probably have been lost in 
1940 foxleynorris said during the unveiling if he had not 
won his victory in 1940 there would be no other statues or 
memorials in this capital city 
the 88yearold mother of queen elizabeth ii whose late 
husband king george vi had sought recognition for dowding in 
1942 agreed 
he was a wartime leader to whom this country owes so much 
she said as she unveiled the statue

military medical teams responded quickly and 
professionally after the august air show tragedy at ramstein air 
base in west germany suggesting pentagon efforts to improve 
readiness are working a study says 
a study team reported the first army medevac helicopter landed 
at the scene just four minutes after one of the italian stunt team 
jets cart wheeled into a crowd a study team said 
within less than two hours more than 270 victims had been 
evacuated from the scene and were receiving medical care the team 
said in a report to dr william mayer assistant defense secretary 
for health affairs 
the accident occurred when three italian jets collided during an 
air show aug 28 and one of them plunged into the crowd and 
exploded in flames sixtynine people died either at the scene or 
later as a result of injuries and burns all three pilots were 
among the dead 
the study team lauded the medical response 
to expect people to be suddenly faced with a mass casualty 
event most for the first time in their lives and completely 
clear a disaster scene within 96 minutes without any error is 
humanly impossible the team said 
but we identified no instance where anyone was harmed by 
negligence or error 
the study team also lauded west german medical professionals and 
the manner in which american and german emergency teams worked 
together saying any difficulties that arose were minor and did 
not affect the rescue effort 
the team said it was highly impressed by the professionalism 
and effectiveness of the combined german and american response to 
the disaster and added it appears the victims were managed 
efficiently and effectively 
army lt col thomas hawks one of six officers ordered by mayer 
to study the air show disaster said their performance was 
phenomenal 
last week a special inquiry commission blamed the disaster on 
pilot error the collision occurred as the teams solo pilot 
was trying to fly through a heartshaped formation made by the 
other two planes 
the cause of the midair collision between the solo pilot and 
two other planes from the italian stunt flying team frecce 
tricolori has been determined to have been human error by the solo 
pilot the report said 
mayer who was recruited by former defense secretary caspar w 
weinberger to upgrade the military medical system has worked for 
several years to improve emergency response times and to deploy 
more mobile and emergency medical gear in the field 
he has demanded that commanders of medical detachments emphasize 
wartime readiness not just the peacetime business of treating 
servicemen and their dependents 
by coincidence the medical personnel assigned to the base 
clinic at ramstein had staged an emergency exercise just two months 
before the disaster working with an army helicopter unit from the 
nearby landstuhl regional medical center the study team found 
following those exercise procedures the first casualties from 
the air show were taken to the ramstein clinic by ambulance when 
the clinic filled about 70 patients were automatically sent by air 
to landstuhl the team said 
when landstuhl filled german authorities smoothly directed the 
flow of patients to several civilian hospitals in the region the 
study said 
we identified no significant mistakes in the medical 
management of this crisis the team concluded

i felt there was crying need for some voice in the us to say 
that your worth is not measured by the size of your waistline

society that worships thinness 
people who wouldnt dream of joking about ethnic groups or

bombs exploded early sunday outside a 
church and a school in attacks police blamed on germanspeaking 
separatists in italys ethnically troubled alto adige region no 
injuries were reported 
police said the explosion at san giuseppe church in appiano six 
miles outside bolzano severely damaged the main altar windows and 
furnishings 
the blast caused an estimated 740000 in damage to the church 
which dates back to 1800 and mainly serves the tiny 
italianspeaking minority in the town of 10000 people near the 
austrian border 
police said the bomb was put on a window sill at the back of the 
church 
it was the first time a church has been targeted in the 
separatist bombing campaign in the region also known as south 
tyrol 
police said they found a leaflet at the site signed by the ein 
tirol separatist group the leaflet written in german called on 
local residents to demand a plebiscite for an independent tyrol and 
criticized the bishop of the bolzano diocese for favoring a mixed 
ethnic population 
in the other attack which occurred about the same time a bomb 
went off outside a school for italian speakers in bolzano 
police said the device hidden in a plastic container severely 
damaged about a dozen cars and smashed windows of the school and 
surrounding buildings 
although no leaflet was found outside the school police blamed 
the attack on the separatist movement 
sundays attacks brought to 23 the number of bombings in the 
alto adige region this year the attacks have caused considerable 
property damage but no serious casualties 
the violence stems from tensions between the alto adiges 
300000 ethnic germans and 125000 italians the region was taken 
from austria at the end of world war i 
the germanspeaking majority wants priority in obtaining 
government jobs and more control over local broadcasting another 
goal is the right to have trials conducted in german extremists

experience instead attacks bushs judgment and challenges the 
administrations right to claim any credit for the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan or the end of the iraniraq war 
dukakis supports the negotiated ban on mediumrange nuclear 
missiles and endorses the goal of a 50 percent reduction in 
longrange missiles in ussoviet talks at geneva but he 
attributes the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachevs recognition of his countrys economic 
failures not to president reagans military buildup and gettough 
stance toward the soviets 
both presidential candidates would be certain to press ahead 
with arms control talks and try to build on the momentum achieved 
in the four reagangorbachev summits 
although dukakis has accused the reagan administration of 
mishandling middle east policy and waiting until the twilight of 
its term to seek a breakthrough there neither dukakis nor bush has 
spelled out any major initiatives to bring the arabs and israelis 
together 
both have assured israel of continued us support dukakis has 
endorsed shifting the us embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem a 
move that administration officials fear could undermine progress 
toward an arabisraeli settlement 
but in such troublespots as nicaragua and south africa dukakis 
is committed to changing the policies adopted by reagan and 
championed by bush 
bush supports renewed aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
dukakis calls reagans centralamerican policies a fiasco and 
vehemently opposes contra aid favoring instead the diplomatic 
peace plan of costa rican president oscar arias 
on south africa dukakis promises to press for tougher 
international sanctions against the apartheid regime bush says 
further sanctions would only hurt black workers dukakis also 
opposes us aid for the south africanbacked rebels in angola 
the democratic nominee says the united states should work with 
its allies and through international organizations rather than go 
it alone he has said the nato allies and japan must bear a larger 
share of the common defense 
bush a former ambassador to the united nations says youve 
got to understand that it is only the united states that can stand 
for freedom and democracy around the world and we cant turn it 
over to the united nations or other multilateral organizations 
bush cites the inf treaty the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan and the tentative end of the iraniraq war as 
vindication of the administrations peace through strength 
philosophy 
for the vice president that means pressing ahead with 
development and eventual deployment of star wars or the strategic 
defense initiative which dukakis once ridiculed as a fantasy 
it also means pounding dukakis for opposing both the mobile mx 
and midgetman missiles the soviets are modernizing they 
continue to modernize and we cant simply say weve got enough 
nuclear weapons lets freeze bush said 
dukakis favored a nuclear freeze in the early 1980s when the 
reagan administration persuaded nervous allies in western europe to 
accept pershing ii and cruise missiles to counter the soviets own 
mediumrange weapons 
the governor has said the 13000 nuclear weapons in the us 
arsenal and the 9000 stockpiled by the soviets are enough to blow 
each country up forty times over 
but dukakis supports the stealth bomber which rolls off the 
assembly line in a few weeks and backs the new generation of 
nuclear missiles for the trident submarine 
bush has said his approach toward the soviet union would avoid 
swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism 
dukakis speaks of trying to drive the agenda with the soviet 
union instead of following gorbachevs lead 
bush has visited 74 foreign countries as vice president he was 
envoy to china and director of central intelligence as well as 
ambassador to the united nations 
i dont think we should risk turning over the leadership and 
security of this free world of ours to a man with literally no 
experience in foreign affairs bush told voters in south river 
nj recently 
its not the length of your resume counters dukakis its 
your strength its your values the quality of the people you 
pick its your understanding of the forces of change in a sweeping 
new world 
dukakis has questioned bushs judgment in not trying to block 
the armsforhostages deal with iran he says bush must share the 
blame for dealing with panamanas military leader manuel noriega 
now under indictment for alleged involvement in drug trafficking 
he criticized bush for once toasting ousted philippine president 
ferdinand marcos for your adherence to democratic principles 
dukakis supports a mutual ban on testing and deployment of 
antisatellite weapons and a prohibition of all underground nuclear 
tests 
bush supports the administrations controversial broad 
interpretation of the antiballistic missile or abm treaty a move 
intended to leave room for testing star wars dukakis favors the 
original narrow interpretation 
bush says he wants the world to adopt and enforce a total ban on 
chemical and biological weapons dukakis scoffs at that saying 
that bush cast tiebreaking senate votes in favor of resuming 
production of chemical weapons 
bush has accused dukakis of opposing the us invasion of 
grenada in 1983 and the 1986 strike against libya the democrat 
denies the charge 
dukakis hedged his support on both occasions he said the 
grenada invasion was justified if the lives of american students 
were at stake and the libyan raid was proper if its aim was to hit 
terrorist bases and not to assassinate libyan leader moammar 
gadhafi

chestoa view a scenic overlook 
jutting out from the blue ridge parkway in the mountains of north 
carolina has become the focal point of a murder case full of 
contradictions and intrigue 
did jim gibbs a hardworking father of three push his wife 
helen and another woman hundreds of feet to their death oct 17 
or is gibbs a victim in his time of grief an innocent man 
charged with murder for an accident 
i cant see a shred of evidence against him said gibbs 
younger brother gerald gibbs he adored that woman with god as 
my witness i never heard a cross word between them 
but authorities said gibbs account of what happened is full of 
holes that includes his explanation that the three adults left 
five children alone at their motel and went to chestoa view to take 
photos of the sunset 
if he wanted a sunset picture he wouldnt be taking them 
facing east said howard parr chief ranger for the parkway for 
the national parks service we also were suspicious how this guy 
was at a loss to explain what happened just before they fell 
sheriff bobby haynes said gibbs 37 of fayetteville was 
arrested after things didnt add up the couple had been having 
marital problems and a 100000 life insurance policy had been 
taken out on mrs gibbs last spring he said 
gibbs lawyer ronnie mitchell acknowledged problems in the 
10year marriage but said that the couple had reconciled and that 
the insurance was mrs gibbs idea i dont know who the 
beneficiary is he said 
initial reports indicated mrs gibbs 31 and her friend susan 
haire 32 of ladson sc died in an accident their bodies were 
found 150 feet and 300 feet below the overlook 
gibbs who also was found about 150 feet down told 
investigators he had his back turned and was setting up his camera 
when one of the women apparently slipped over the twofoot wall and 
pulled the other one with her 
gibbs said he fell while trying to rescue the women and was 
hospitalized overnight but parr said he suffered only minor cuts 
and bruises 
if he had fallen 100 feet like he claimed he would have been 
hurt a lot worse than he was the ranger said 
two tourists who were at the overlook that evening told a ranger 
they heard voices from the darkened gorge below they said they 
heard a woman scream oh my arm and then heard a mans voice 
said ranger j russ whitlock 
after five days police charged gibbs with murder the state 
will seek the death penalty said assistant district attorney mike 
edwards 
gibbs who is being held without bail maintained his innocence 
when he was taken to jail 
i swear to god i didnt do it he said i dont know what 
happened youre all wrong youre crazy i didnt do it i tried 
to help my wife 
during a bail hearing wednesday about 30 relatives packed the 
courtroom in an unsuccessful effort to win his release mrs gibbs 
mother a sister and a brother also were present they declined to 
be interviewed 
several of gibbs coworkers and friends said he was a dedicated 
and loving husband and father who never missed a day of work in 
nearly 19 years at a tire plant mrs gibbs was a nurse at a 
veterans administration hospital 
our families spent a lot of time together said debbie 
baylor who like mrs haire attended nursing school with mrs 
gibbs they were a warm loving family

nearly half the members of congress asked 
secretary of state george shultz on sunday to use his influence in 
solving the 13year armed conflict in the indonesian territory of 
east timor 
fortyseven senators and 182 house members from both parties 
signed letters drawn up by sen david durenberger rminn and 
rep tony hall dohio 
the letters cite continuing human rights abuses in east timor 
including the torture of timorese under interrogation by the 
indonesian military and the transfer of political prisoners to the 
capital of jakarta they also note that international human rights 
organizations have been denied access to the region and the roman 
catholic church has been intimidated 
by sending this letter now my colleagues and i want to ensure 
that the east timor tragedy receives increased attention both from 
the reagan administration and its successor durenberger said in 
a statement 
the senate letter signed by 33 democrats and 14 republicans 
praises shultz for raising the issue of east timor a former 
portuguese colony with indonesian officials over the past six 
years 
but it adds we believe the continuing military conflict in 
the territory and any renewed shortages of food and medical 
supplies warrant the careful attention of the united states 
the house letter notes indonesias role in seeking an end to the 
vietnamese occupation of cambodia and says we believe it is 
appropriate for a similar effort to be made regarding east timor 
indonesia invaded and annexed east timor in 1975 
hall said about onefifth of east timors original population of 
700000 have died as a result of the invasion and later military 
operations in the territory

even as michael dukakis insists there is time 
to score an upset in the nov 8 balloting many democrats already 
are secondguessing his campaign strategy in anticipation of 
another national election defeat 
after the election this may be the campaign considered the 
worst managed in this century said democratic sen terry sanford 
of north carolina 
like many people in his party sanford insisted he thought 
dukakis still had a chance to defeat republican nominee george 
bush but he didnt sound overly optimistic 
id bet money on it he said of the chances of a dukakis 
upset but i wouldnt bet my law license on it 
other prominent democrats have urged dukakis openly for weeks to 
sharpen his responses to bushs steady attacks 
dukakis has really got to take off the gloves said sen sam 
nunn of georgia hes got to defend himself i wouldnt have 
been a punching bag on some of these issues 
democrats have lost four of the last five presidential 
elections and current polls point to the likelihood that dukakis 
will make it five of six 
even dukakis recently conceded he didnt get his message out 
clearly enough and was too slow in responding to negative 
commercials from the bush campaign 
theres no mystery about why they put those ads on they have 
done damage theres no question about that he said during an 
interview on cbs evening news 
he said he responded but perhaps more subtly than i should 
have or than running mate lloyd bentsen suggested why because 
im fundamentally a positive person 
on the stump as he headed into the final week of the campaign 
dukakis proclaimed there is time to do it 
theyre running a beautiful campaign right now said ed 
martin executive director of the texas democratic party but a 
proper campaign for three months has been compressed into three 
weeks 
among those in the ranks of the secondguessers was new york 
gov mario cuomo who told reporters he thought the dukakis 
campaign had failed to figure out a general election strategy 
they did so well by the end of the democratic convention they 
said okay now well take it easy get some rest take our 
breath cuomo said the other guy started landing jabs and 
uppercuts and picking up points and then they look at the card with 
three rounds to go and now youre down six rounds to three 
every campaign has a jillion things go wrong with it said 
john white a texan and former democratic party chairman who backed 
jesse jackson for the presidential nomination and if youre 
behind everybody points them out 
to many democrats the biggest problem with the dukakis campaign 
has been a lack of experience in national politics among his top 
advisers 
the men running the bush effort have experience dating back to 
the gerald ford campaign in 1976 and in the case of media adviser 
roger ailes to richard nixons campaigns before that they all 
played major roles in ronald reagans 1980 and 1984 campaigns 
by contrast no one in the dukakis campaign had a 
decisionmaking role in any presidential campaign prior to walter 
f mondales 49state landslide loss to reagan in 1984 
our timing has just been terribly off said white in 
august nothing happened so we started august work in september 
september work in october 
he attributed that to inexperience 
we do not have any historical memory he said every 
campaign is a brand new one we bring in brand new people 
they tried real hard to reinvent the wheel and when they 
ended up it wasnt even round said boston advertising executive 
dan payne of the dukakis campaign staff payne produced some of 
dukakis commercials during the democratic primaries 
i dont want to do a postmortem until theres a mortem 
said mark siegel a political consultant and member of the 
democratic national committee i dont think this patient is 
dead i think a little sick 
added siegel i dont want to be critical of the campaign 
but there were a lots of things some of us would like to have 
seen done differently we would have liked the campaign to take the 
initiative from the outset to define instead of defend to put 
bush on the defensive

a fire on a shooting range at a us marine base on 
okinawa burned 30 acres of woodland before it was brought under 
control sunday night a japanese fire office said 
us military officials were not immediately available for 
comment 
but the japanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said there were no reports of injuries from the fire at camp hansen 
he said the fire began saturday night on the south ridge of the 
mountain in camp hansen which is used for rifle and howitzer 
practice 
the fire spread to adjacent ridges but us military 
helicopters dropped chemicals on the blaze and it had almost burned 
out by sunday night he said 
the kyodo news service said a lack of rain had left the area 
very dry and the fire may have spread after it set off unexploded 
shells left on the range

no one admits to liking it or even being 
influenced by it but it works thats why candidates from the 
presidency down are running negative campaigns 
its sort of like television everyone deplores it yet people 
watch it says andrew kohut president of the gallup polling 
organization they dont like negative campaigning but they have 
to take their cues about these candidates from whats being 
offered 
negative campaigns are nothing new im sure that in elections 
for the roman senate people criticized their opponents says 
democratic pollster harrison hickman 
what is relatively new is the television attack ad a media 
tool that reinforces and magnifies a candidates campaign rhetoric 
these ads sometimes allow him to be a softspoken candidate while 
impersonal narrators trash his rival in 30second spots on the tv 
screen 
delivering the message through television is much more 
effective than going out on the stump and calling the other guy a 
scoundrel kohut says 
the memorable scenes produced by republican george bushs tv 
campaign include prisoners passing through a revolving door and a 
harbor filled with floating trash attack ads against democrat 
michael dukakis about prison furloughs and boston harbor pollution 
the endless images of prisoners coming through turnstiles into 
your living room are much more powerful than anything bush can say 
on the stump in a 15second news clip says kathleen hall 
jamieson a university of texas professor and specialist in 
political communications 
dukakis began fighting back only after weeks of leaving bushs 
tv assaults unanswered political scientist larry sabato says 
dukakis made a misjudgment that could prove fatal in an era when 
an attack unanswered is an attack agreed to 
besides his tough negative tv ads the vice president has 
attacked the massachusetts governor personally for his membership 
in the american civil liberties union and his veto of a bill that 
would have required teachers to lead their classes in reciting the 
pledge of allegiance 
bush doesnt sound damagingly strident because it all looks 
positive jamieson said he frames it as a defense of the 
country against a dangerous enemy 
the upshot is that in the battle between dukakis and bush to 
define the democratic presidential nominee the gop candidate seems 
to be winning 
said hickman last spring dukakis was an empty vessel and the 
dukakis campaign through free press and paid advertising was 
trying to pour crystal clear water into that vessel at the same 
time the bush campaign was trying to pour ink into it it 
obviously changed the color of the water 
moreover he said negative campaigning probably helped bush 
overcome his wimp image and not responding probably made people 
think dukakis is passive 
negative campaigning however can backfire 
jamieson cites the classic case of a 1966 ad against ronald 
reagan in his first bid for governor of california the ad said 
reagan was a movie actor who had played many roles this year he 
wants to play governor are you willing to pay the price of 
admission it asked 
what a stupid ad in a community that earns its living by 
entertaining jamieson said the republicans thought it was so 
effective they paid for time and aired it themselves 
negative campaigning is rampant on the senate trail as well this 
year the new york times said in an editorial that the race in new 
jersey has frequently looked more like mudwrestling than a 
contest for the us senate 
in minnesota sen david durenberger and democratic challenger 
hubert h humphrey iii are trying to negotiate a ceasefire after 
exchanging a barrage of tv attacks nebraska senate candidate 
robert kerrey is scoring with an ad featuring an animated clay 
figure that attacks gop sen david karnes assault tactics 
unlike academics and politicians who bemoan the sorry state of 
campaigning hickman says negativity is inevitable and not 
necessarily bad 
why shouldnt voters find useful information in this he 
asks part of what you want to find out is how does a candidate 
comport himself when hes under fire an election is an 
adversarial proceeding voters understand that 
but sabato a university of virginia professor says voters can 
reach their limits with negative campaigning and register their 
protests in the polls 
once they do that youll be surprised how quickly the 
consultants turn to positive ads sabato said citing two senate 
races in north carolina to prove his point 
the 1984 contest between jesse helms and james hunt was bitter 
and expensive two years later the race between terry sanford and 
james broyhill had a civilized upbeat tone sabato said 
their polling kept showing that people were reacting strongly 
to the negatives that were run sabato said they were hearing 
if i see one more negative ad im voting against the candidate 
who airs it

an explosion early sunday leveled a 
downtown building and severely damaged two adjacent apartment 
buildings injuring 11 people authorities said 
the explosion about two blocks from the state capitol also 
broke windows in a number of downtown stores and was felt by 
residents several miles away police patrolled downtown streets to 
prevent looting 
i heard a very big explosion and all the lights went out 
said joyce kelley who lived in one of the apartments and got out 
safely with her 10monthold daughter i started yelling fire 
because i knew there were other people in the building 
authorities suspected natural gas triggered the blast that blew 
out plate glass windows three blocks away and flattened the 
twostory building which housed the missouri association for 
social welfare a private advocacy group said sgt ralph robinett 
of the missouri state highway patrol 
fires that broke out in small apartment houses on either side of

eleven were treated at hospitals for cuts and other minor injuries 
police said 
seventeen of 18 huge plateglass windows in a food barn

scientists will not rush another attempt to launch 
the soviet space shuttle which was grounded 51 seconds before 
blastoff because of problems with ground equipment a newspaper 
report said sunday 
komsomolskaya pravda quoting air force maj gen vladimir e 
gudilin said the next effort to put the craft into orbit would 
likely take place after the revolution day holiday nov 7 
however gudilin was quoted as saying were ready to try 
again quite soon 
you must not forget that our launch is experimental that 
there hasnt been any other like it he said does a child 
learning to walk not fall 
in the situation that arose which of course was emotionally 
unpleasant there is a rational grain accumulating experience 
the launch of the unmanned shuttle named buran was postponed 
saturday after a computer sensed that an equipment platform had not 
pulled far enough away from the giant energiya booster rocket the 
computer automatically stopped the countdown 
the soviet official said all systems would be checked while 
technicians refill rockets with liquid fuel the newspaper reported 
unlike the first flight of the us shuttle columbia in 1981 
the soviet craft will be unmanned flying on an automated guidance 
system plans for its first flight call for it to make two orbits 
around earth and return to a concrete landing strip eight miles 
from the launch site 
the huge booster rocket which can lift a payload of more than 
100 tons has been used only once before 
on a test flight in may 1987 its payload failed to reach orbit 
soviet officials said the problem stemmed from the guidance system 
rather than the booster rocket

a strong earthquake awakened residents 
early sunday but no damage or injuries were reported the alaska 
tsunami warning center reported 
the temblor measured 51 on the richter scale of ground motion 
it struck at 133 am about 60 miles northwest of homer said paul 
whitmore a geophysicist at the center 
a lot of people felt it in anchorage and palmer whitmore 
said that area that it occurred in is a farily common area for 
earthquakes 
but since the quake was so early in the morning the center 
received few calls about it whitmore said 
i woke up sometime in the night because i felt my house 
shaking said stan porter a federal aviaion administration 
official at the homer flight service station but thats just 
part of life up here he said adding that he rolled over and 
went back to sleep 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage in a populated area 6 can be severe and a 7 reading is a 
major quake capable of widespread heavy damage

archbishop desmond tutu on 
sunday prayed with and encouraged blacks threatened with eviction 
from this fishing town hundreds of miles from the nearest area 
where they can live legally 
the church service concluded a twoday visit by the anglican 
leader to a windswept treeless plain outside port nolloth about 
400 miles north of cape town about 500 blacks live in 90 tents in 
the remote town 
god is on your side and god cannot ultimately be defeated 
tutu told the congregation that is why those who oppress you 
have already lost 
the tent dwellers who were served with eviction notices in 
january are fighting the order in court 
under south africas segregation laws blacks have no legal 
right to live in this sparsely populated region called namaqualand 
which stretches along the atlantic coast to the border with 
southwest africa 
the nearest official black township is in upington more than 
300 miles east 
tutu arrived saturday on his first visit to the desolate camp 
whose residents collect water in barrels and use portable outhouses 
about 100 women some with babies on their backs led the black 
archbishop and his wife leah through the rows of tents 
while tutu conferred with community leader lingington sonqishe 
in a corrugated metal shack a crowd outside sang in praise of tutu 
and oliver tambo president of the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla group fighting apartheid 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no voice 
in national affairs which are controlled by the 5 million whites 
tutu winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize for his campaign 
against the policy of segregation said he was dismayed at the 
living conditions but impressed with the determination of the 
residents 
i want to express admiration for the people here at the 
extraordinary resilience and the strength of their commitment to 
stand for their rights tutu said one is humbled really to 
see how people refuse to be manipulated and intimidated 
many of the port nolloth blacks who work in mines or with the 
fishing industry have been in the area for 10 years initially 
they lived with mixedrace people in a shantytown that was 
demolished 
the mixedrace population was given new housing while most of 
the blacks fled to southwest africa which is ruled by south 
africa authorities there forced them back into south africa in 
1986 and the blacks believed the government was going to allow 
them to stay permanently 
a legal battle has been waged since then with the next court 
session scheduled nov 9 
they were given the promise that they would have houses built 
for them tutu said the town council is reneging on that 
promise their only sin is that they have black skin 
if the tents are demolished sonqishe said the residents would 
live outdoors like monkeys and baboons then the whole world will 
see the suffering 
tutus visit to port nolloth was covered by crews from 
independent television network and visnews two londonbased 
television news agencies itns bureau chief mike wills said 
security police seized the film when it arrived at a small airport 
near johannesburg sunday afternoon the officers said they were 
acting under stateofemergency regulations wills said

the plight of whales trapped by arctic 
ocean ice got worldwide attention and the part played in their 
rescue by two soviet icebreakers got the special attention of 
members of a third grade class 
i feel sorry for every living creature that has to go through 
this said lisa delack a thirdgrader at centennial elementary 
school in loveland 
lisa convinced her teacher and school principal that the soviets 
deserved some thanks for their help in freeing two california gray 
whales off the north coast of alaska a third whale disappeared and 
was presumed dead 
i saw the whales and the russians helping and i thought it was 
very nice of them to do it lisa said 
so she and her classmates penned their appreciation on 
bluelined school paper some illustrated with drawings of whales 
their letters were sealed in an envelope and mailed to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev in moscow 
centennial principal sam simonetta says its natural for the 
children to respond to animals be they pets or wild creatures 
thousands of miles away 
they like them and theyre concerned about them simonetta 
said 
when someone came in and was willing to help our country it 
made these kids feel real good about it he said

defense contractors are eagerly 
studying democratic sen sam nunns suggestion for a groundbased 
system to protect against an accidental missile attack 
at least two major california contractors ran to their drawing 
boards after nunn the georgia chairman of the senate armed 
services committee broached the idea last january as a limited 
alternative to star wars the reagan administrations proposal for 
a spacebased antimissile system 
nunns proposal the accidental launch protection systems would 
resemble the antiballistic missile defense system dismantled in 
the mid1970s although the proposal has some support the 
pentagons defense science board placed little emphasis on it in a 
report last may and nunn himself appears to have concluded that 
deploying a limited system would cause more problems than it would 
solve 
nunn has acknowledged that for the system to be effective it 
would be costly and may not be possible within the antiballistic 
missile treaty 
nunns plan offended those opposed to star wars or the 
strategic defense initiative they argued any deployment of an 
antimissile system would abrogate the 1972 treaty 
but many defense contractors and other sdi backers support 
nunns plan because they think it may open the way to a more 
extensive antimissile system including spacebased weapons 
congress has frozen star wars funding at about 41 billion 
edward teller the physicist credited with planting the idea for 
star wars with president reagan in 1983 calls alps a valuable 
first step to show that we can put up something to show what a 
system will cost 
some major defense contractors agree they say a system to 
protect the continental united states from a limited ballistic 
missile attack could be deployed for about 10 billion the 
pentagon spends about 300 billion a year 
bob willwerth an engineer at lockheed missiles and space co in 
sunnyvale said the entire continental united states could be 
protected from a limited attack if 100 antimissile missiles were 
based at grand forks nd 
the united states dismantled a similar system in grand forks in 
the mid1970s because it was deemed ineffective the soviets have 
a 100missile antiballistic missile system around moscow 
permitted under the abm pact 
engineers at lockheed and at the mcdonnell douglas astronautics 
co in huntington beach say existing surveillance tracking and 
command systems are nearly adequate to operate a 100missile 
antimissile system 
roughly twothirds of what you need is already in place 
said willwerth pointing at a chart that shows satellites and 
communications links already used to warn of a soviet attack 
lockheed has a contract to develop the exoatmospheric 
reentryvehicle interceptor system eris that would strike enemy 
warheads before they reenter the atmosphere to begin their final 
descent 
the system has been designated by the pentagon as the one most 
likely to be used in the first phase of star wars should the united 
states decide in the 1990s to go ahead with the spacebased 
antimissile system 
mcdonnell douglas has developed another system to intercept 
warheads after they entered the atmosphere 
although the system has not been accepted as part of the first 
phase of the star wars project mcdonnell douglas engineers are 
pushing it as a possible key component for alps mcdonnell 
douglass system is known as high endoatmospheric defense 
interceptor hedi 
dean hofferth of mcdonnell douglas estimates it would cost about 
10 billion to build an alps system of 70 eris and 30 hedi missiles 
at grand forks 
but hofferth said a singlesite system such as one at grand 
forks could not protect the continental united states from an 
accidental attack especially by submarines 
instead mcdonnell proposes five or six additional sites spaced 
along the atlantic pacific and gulf coasts with 6070 eris and 
6070 hedi missiles apiece costing an estimated 3 billion per 
site 
that would violate the amb treaty which limits each superpower 
to a single site with 100 antimissile missiles 
a single site said hofferth would be overwhelmed by an 
unauthorized launch by a single enemy commander 
soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles are deployed in 
batteries of about 10 missiles which in the case of the heavy 
ss18 missile could carry 100 or more warheads

the soviet governments ability to slide budget 
deficits past the legislature for years could have been a result of 
simple ignorance 
the huge bureaucracy that sets prices irrespective of supply and 
demand and the virtual absence of any accounting system in 
staterun businesses may have hid the size of the problem until 
mikhail s gorbachev began implementing his economic reforms 
government officials acknowledged during a twoday session of 
the supreme soviet on thursday and friday that the budget has been 
running in the red for years the 795 billion budget for 1989 
passed friday by the legislature contains a deficit 55 billion at 
the official exchange rate 
but that may be just a guess 
the soviet union has only recently discovered the concept of 
accounting for profit and loss finance minister boris gostev said 
thursday that so far accounting is not yet reliable because 
many administrators dont understand modern management 
until recently prices in the soviet union were set by the 
government without regard to costs the massive attempt to 
determine the real cost of everything in the country started in 
january actual price reform is still in the planning stages 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev gorbachevs closest 
adviser on the politburo said last week that the economy turned 
out to be in worse shape than the leadership thought when it began 
the policy of perestroika or reconstruction three years ago 
for decades the soviet union has tried to ignore the law of 
supply and demand the government set prices that were designed to 
nearly give away the basics of life a roof heat a bus ride to 
work bread and cabbage and to charge a fortune for most 
everything else 
an apartment could cost 25 rubles or 40 a month at the same 
time a video cassette was priced at 70 rubles or 110 
the government was building expensive apartments virtually 
giving them away and losing money on each one 
in factories all prices were fixed by bureaucrats and 
generations of managers didnt dare breathe the word profit 
the result according to gostevs calculations is 24000 
bankrupt businesses and a budget deficit now he said we have 
to learn how to live according to our incomes 
soviets also are discovering that capital has a cost 
enterprises functioning at a loss dont feel they are gostev 
said because they are using funds generated by other businesses 
without market interest rates to ensure that capital investment 
is used either efficiently or not at all the soviets wound up with 
hundreds of halffinished construction projects and mounds of 
modern equipment lying unused in factory warehouses 
state planning chief yuri maslyukov gave a hint of the problem 
when he said friday that the government is giving up on hundreds of 
millions of dollars worth of unfinished farm buildings those 
projects he said will be written off another alien concept in 
the soviet union 
publicizing the deficit is a natural outgrowth of gorbachevs 
policy of glasnost or openness but it clearly aids his program of 
perestroika by telling the public that waste inefficiency and 
subsidies have a cost 
that lays the groundwork for an expected reduction in those 
subsidies and for his newest drive a demand for stringent 
costcutting in government agencies and the staterun businesses 
that still make up 99 percent of the economy 
even if the deficit estimate was accurate translating it from 
rubles to dollars has little meaning the ruble is not freely 
convertible to dollars 
news stories typically use the official soviet exchange rate 
set at 161 to the ruble by the government the black market rate 
is 2025 cents to the ruble which is closer but probably lower 
than a freetrade rate would be 
at that rate the soviet deficit would be only 68 billion to 
85 billion but the entire soviet government would be operating 
on only about 100 billion to 120 billion a year

canadians caught up in debate over a free trade 
pact with the united states are following a heated political race 
of their own and paying less attention than usual to the us 
presidential campaign 
what they do see south of the border is often dismissed as an 
excessive amount of media handling and too much superficial 
treatment of the issues 
canadians congratulated themselves after the debate series among 
the leaders of their three major parties by comparing the breadth 
of the discussions with the debates between the us candidates 
canadas leaders were much more forthright articulate and 
revealing of themselves than the candidates for the white house in 
the us debates the independent globe and mail newspaper said 
in an editorial issues received far more vigorous airings here 
within the limits of television 
six hours of debates between prime minister brian mulroney of 
the progressive conservative party liberal party leader john 
turner and ed broadbent of the socialist new democratic party 
crystallized the free trade agreement with the united states as the 
campaigns dominant issue 
before mulroney dissolved parliament oct 1 to call the 
election some concern was voiced that a november election could be 
complicated because voters might be distracted by the us campaign 
instead a once complacent political race in which mulroney 
appeared headed for easy victory now is becoming among the most 
electric in memory 
a survey by the environics polling firm found that 74 percent of 
canadians either watched the debates here or followed news reports 
about them polls have concluded that turner easily won the 
debates in which he accused mulroney of selling out canada in the 
free trade agreement 
anything less than a majority government for mulroney in the 
nov 21 vote places in doubt the future of the agreement which 
would eliminate tariffs and trade barriers between the two 
countries over a 10year period 
the us congress easily approved it this year but canadas 
parliament has yet to act on it if passed in canada the agreement 
would take effect jan 1 
some political analysts say the us campaign between george 
bush and michael dukakis is simply considered boring they note 
that the contest slipped off the front pages in the united states 
in its middle weeks 
theres no clear favorite for canadians david eirikson a 
political science professor at the university of british columbia 
said in a phone interview they canadians are busy with 
domestic affairs 
a gallup poll published by the toronto star in early october 
said 56 percent of canadians were for dukakis and 44 percent for 
bush 
the question asked the 1039 canadians surveyed was just 
suppose for a minute that canadians were allowed to vote in a us 
presidential election if the us election were held today would 
you cast your vote for republican george bush or democrat michael 
dukakis 
the cornerstones of canadian public opinion about government 
generally are based on such issues as health care social services 
and other policies that would be to the left of the republican 
party 
dukakis also is known to provincial leaders from eastern canada 
because of of his participation in regional forums quebecs 
premier robert bourassa has spoken well of the massachusetts 
governor 
both us candidates have pledged they would make improvements 
on acid rain the other key issue troubling uscanadian relations 
michael perley of the canadian coalition on acid rain said in an 
interview that either would be an improvement on the reagan 
administration by a considerable margin 
he said dukakis plan is the more detailed and the more savvy 
if you like while bush is vaguer but he added we dont 
feel its our place as a canadian interest group to endorse 
anyone 
canadians often express dismay at the low voter turnout in the 
united states 
almost half of eligible american voters are expected to sit 
out next months us elections putting the multimilliondollar 
showbiz political campaigns in the category of a couchpotato 
sport wrote norma greenaway a canadian press correspondent in 
washington 
canadian voter turnout has averaged 75 percent in the nine 
federal elections since 1962

a newspaper advertisement invoked the name of 
adolf hitler to attack the leftofcenter labor party on sunday in 
escalating political warfare before this weeks election 
politicians made lastditch efforts to sway undecided voters 
before parliamentary elections tuesday the latest polls showed 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc and foreign 
minister shimon peres labor party running neckandneck 
the army sent extra troops to the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip to prevent any upsurge in violence caused by the elections 
underground leaders of the 10monthold palestinian uprising 
called for a general strike in the occupied lands on election day 
and asked israeli arabs to elect the voices of peace 
peres has backed the idea of exchanging occupied land for 
guarantees of peace shamirs likud bloc rejects the idea 
the uprising is the central issue in the campaign 
the hitler ad which appeared in the daily maariv showed the 
words international conference below a photo of hitler meeting 
former british prime minister neville chamberlain during the 1938 
munich conference 
peres favors an international conference to achieve lasting 
peace between israel and its arab neighbors likud and other 
rightwing parties argue that such a conference would pressure 
israel to accept an unfavorable settlement 
the ad seemed to suggest that israel would be selling out to 
very dangerous opponents if it made agreements at an international 
meeting 
the labor partys competitors first and foremost the likud 
have lost their sanity by giving a nation of holocaust survivors 
such revolting propaganda the labor party said in its statement 
about 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust 
labor leaders asked the central elections commission to ban such 
ads 
likud spokesman danny naveh said his partys members were not 
behind the ad israel radio reported he said he knew who paid for 
it but refused to give the name 
maariv deputy editor yitzhak hayerushalmi said the newspaper 
will publish an apology for the ad monday he said someone in the 
advertising department messed up by failing to consult editors 
before publishing the ad 
in radio commercials sunday likud accused labor of secretly 
planning a 70percent tax hike after the elections it also said a 
labor victory would hurt israels jews 
one ad featured what it called a worried voter saying if 
shamir is elected it will be a disaster a disaster for the arabs 
if peres is elected it will be a disaster for us 
peres in his final campaign swing through southern israel 
lashed out at likud for trying to frighten the public and told 
voters that an international conference would not endanger israel 
he criticized likuds personal attacks during the campaign 
and vowed never to negotiate directly with the palestine liberation 
organization 
the plo represents violence peres told reporters in 
bersheba it doesnt matter what the plo says it matters what 
they shoot 
a survey by a laboraligned polling service published sunday 
predicted the party and its leftist allies would win 63 seats in 
the knesset or parliament to likuds 57 the poll was based on 
interviews with 1200 voters including israeli arabs 
a survey conducted by a likudaffiliated service and published 
sunday indicated the elections would end in a stalemate 
labor and likud have shared power in an uneasy alliance since 
1984 when neither party could form a majority coalition government 
after elections

the president of stanfords black 
student union spoke calmly controlling her anger in the tumult of 
a protest against racism on campus 
theres a dangerous link she said between racist terms 
scrawled on posters at stanford racial slurs at smith college and 
a ghetto party at depauw 
these arent isolated incidents said mary dillard and 
its happening at cornell pennsylvania harvard yale theres 
something wrong with the best and the brightest 
officials of the nations top universities are trying to figure 
out what is wrong and how to fix it but the results so far have 
been disappointing 
stanford president donald kennedy mindful of racist incidents 
last year warned freshmen in his orientation address this fall 
that bigotry is out yet soon afterward two more racist acts 
shocked the campus 
the first was the scrawling of the word niggers across a 
black fraternity poster in the second a poster of german composer 
ludwig van beethoven was altered so he appeared to be black after a 
fraternity house discussion about historic figures alleged to have 
some black ancestry 
it takes as high test scores and other accomplishments to get 
into stanford university but as dillard noted there is an 
appalling ignorance among many students about other cultures and 
that leads to trouble 
ewart ac thomas a psychologist and dean of stanfords school 
of humanities and sciences notes there have been more overt acts 
of racism in this decade throughout the country 
people have attributed it to policies coming out of washington 
attacking civil rights legislation he said there might be 
more to it than that but a tone set in washington could increase 
the sense among people from underrepresented groups that their 
gains are now being assailed 
in many ways reagans eight years have taken the shame out 
of racist behavior said the rev jesse jackson who spoke to 
4000 stanford students on friday students tend to follow in 
rhythm with the leadership 
in recent incidents elsewhere racial slurs were scrawled on 
notes slipped under a door and tacked onto a bulletin board at 
smith college and members of an allwhite white fraternity at 
depauw threw a ghetto party in which they scrawled racist 
grafitti on their house 
cheryl taylor vice chair of the black student union argues 
that many whites dont understand what is racist so it still 
persists in the country and on the campus stanford is not 
divorced from society 
despite its image and high tuition its idyllic campus and links 
to the conservative hoover institution 97yearold stanford is no 
longer simply a bastion for wealthy whites 
grants scholarships and other sources help most students cope 
with the 20000ayear costs 
stanford stepped up admission of minority students 20 years ago 
after the civil rights act and now more than onethird of its 
6457 undergraduate and 6767 graduate students from every state 
and 100 foreign countries are nonwhite 
altogether there are 1378 asian americans 739 blacks 721 
chicanos 170 hispanics 96 american indians and 1834 foreigners 
our diversity is a fundamental part of the education we 
offer kennedy said but he acknowledged problems in bringing 
together people from different cultures 
we are almost haunted by the fact that despite our best 
efforts we are still vulnerable to the charge that forms of racism 
survive here he said 
albert m camarillo director of stanfords chicano affairs 
office and chairman of the committee on minority issues said 
some people with ethnocentric attitudes come to this kind of 
environment and feel threatened and want to act out their 
resistance to it 
many minority students complain stanford is not doing nearly 
enough to fight bigotry most whites agree but some argue that 
blacks are exaggerating the problems and object to branding the 
university as racist 
keith archuleta assistant dean and director of the black 
community services center said theres something wrong with the 
structure at stanford when most of the people of color who we 
have affirmative action for here are in the kitchens or cleaning 
the dorms 
camarillos committee has been studying the problems on campus 
since last spring and is finalizing a very complex set of 
recommendations he said 
there are no easy answers he said were talking about 
changes in the undergraduate curriculum enhancement of ethnic 
studies recruitment and hiring of minority faculty and staff 
social interaction of minorities and nonminorities and student 
services 
meanwhile stanford students faculty and administrators are 
getting an education in race relations 
we have been alerting people making them aware that there is 
racism on campus and that what happens here does not happen in a 
vacuum dillard said 
this racism is a reflection of society but its also a 
reflection of the universitys being irresponsible she said 
if youre an intellectual powerhouse youve got to start pushing 
some intellectual power

prime minister mahathir mohamad on 
sunday offered cabinet posts to two dissident members of his party 
who have tried to unseat him 
mahathir said tengku razaleigh hamzah a former trade minister 
and former deputy prime minister musa hitam could join his cabinet 
as ministers without portfolio there was no immediate response 
from the two politicians 
because we all wish for unity and i believe we must be 
wholehearted in our efforts to restore unity i make this 
announcement the prime minister told 1545 delegates attending a 
fourday party meeting of his recently formed new united malays 
national organization 
since the country won independence from britain in 1957 all 
malaysias prime ministers have come from the original united 
malays national organization formed in 1946 
in april 1987 razaleigh and musa narrowly lost party elections 
in which they tried to unseat mahathir and abdul ghafar baba as 
party president and deputy president 
in june 1987 razaleighs supporters sought to nullify the 
voting in court alleging that illegal delegates from improperly 
registered party branches had voted 
in february 1988 the high court declared the elections void and 
ruled the party illegal 
mahathir formed the new united malays national organization on 
feb 16 and banned razaleigh musa and their followers from 
membership saying their actions had led to the old party being 
declared illegal 
he reversed himself oct 15 and invited the opposition leaders 
to join the new party 
razaleigh and musa refused claiming mahathir had filled key 
party posts with his own followers and prevented them from winning 
any positions in later elections 
the united malays national organization has governed the country 
in a coalition with 12 other parties since 1957 
the new party the countrys strongest claims about 1 million 
members the original party had about 14 million members

the denver metropolitan area heads into its fifth 
annual better air campaign on tuesday trying to reduce carbon 
monoxide levels that are among the highest in the country and 
threaten its federal highway funds 
the campaign which runs in six counties through jan 31 seeks 
to get residents to cut back on wood burning and reduce the 35 
million miles driven daily 
it will be augmented by statemandated use of cleanerburning 
oxygenated gasoline between tuesday and feb 28 
the cleanair campaign aims to reduce average daily carbon 
monoxide levels in the milehigh metropolitan area by 15 percent to 
19 percent the oxygenated fuels program is expected to yield an 
additional 12 percent reduction 
last seasons combined effort dropped denver from first to 
seventh place on the environmental protection agency list of worst 
cities for carbon monoxide pollution 
were hoping to get about a 10 percent drop in vehicle miles 
driven on a daily basis and also a 60 percent participation rate 
throughout the entire metro area on the wood burning part of the 
program said brad beckham director of the state health 
departments air pollution control division 
if we can get that average daily level down we will go a 
long way toward meeting federal carbon monoxide standards 
beckham said 
the federal sword hanging over the metro areas head is an epa 
threat to cut off federal highway money if the guidelines are not 
met 
epa guidelines say carbon monoxide should not exceed 9 parts per 
million in 1970 denvers levels exceeded that level on 140 
occasions last winter denver exceeded the level only 19 times 
said campaign coordinator anne grady 
they have not invoked the sanctions to the denver metro area 
mainly because they think denver is making reasonable progress in 
addressing that problem beckham said 
the areas pollution problems are aggravated by the high thin 
air cold winters and temperature inversions which trap carbon 
monoxide close to the ground automobile engines also work less 
efficiently at high altitude and emit dirtier exhaust 
last seasons program achieved about a 17 percent reduction in 
carbon monoxide levels 10 percent from the nodrive portion and 7 
percent from reduced wood burning said grady the twomonth 
oxygenated fuels program was credited with reducing carbon monoxide 
8 percent to 95 percent 
the estimated 16 million residents of the sixcounty area are 
being asked not to drive one day a week and to reduce driving 
through car pooling and busing 
in addition eight cities in the metropolitan area have 
mandatory bans on wood burning on high pollution days and all area 
residents will be asked to curtail woodburning 
a key factor will be the oxygenated fuels which contain 
additives of grain alcohol or etherbased mtbe and made their debut 
for a twomonth run here last jan 1 
the fuels oxygen content last time was 15 percent this time 
the oxygen content will be increased to 2 percent added oxygen 
makes the fuel burn more completely

the age of aquarius has given way to the age of 
acquisition and love is too busy being a buzz word to steer the 
stars 
perfect timing organizers say for a 20th anniversary 
production of hair a play that once symbolized everything 60s 
and young 
this is the 80s antidote to rambo said 60s guru timothy 
leary brought in to help a young cast make sense of hair two 
decades after it first transformed american theater 
i think its going to fill a real need 
hair the american tribal rock musical opened on 
broadway in april 1968 and stayed there for 1750 performances 
the new production of the musical opens tuesday at the vic 
theater 
the antiwar antiestablishment message of the musical was a 
milestone in american theater 20 years ago and also marked the 
broadway debut of producer michael butler who also brought 
lenny the story of comedian lenny bruce to broadway 
butler the antiestablishment son of a wealthy illinois family 
stuck with hair through most of the 70s producing it across 
the united states and overseas and he is back producing and 
promoting the new run in chicago 
as far as im concerned its like going back to church 
butler said last week hair is a very beautiful spiritual 
experience i love working with the kids i love the message 
but the kids have changed 
many members of the current cast were still in diapers when 
protests rocked the streets of america and the original 
flowerpower tribe sang of love and peace 
i just thought it was all about drugs and something i had no 
desire to see said 22yearold actress jamie dawn gangi who 
plays the role of crissy in the current 1 million production 
executive producer george millman said the cast had to be taught 
what the era was really like 
we talked to the cast a lot he said we find that its 
difficult for them in that they cant feel it in the way that the 
people who lived it felt it 
and leary who met with the cast several times earlier this 
month helped 
about onethird of the cast was very hip and knew what was 
going on but about a third of them didnt have a clue the 
68yearold leary said from his los angeles home 
i hung out with them some of them are quite naive about 
political and cultural aspects of the period but i think theyre 
catching on quickly 
the new production which millman and butler hope will spark 
spinoffs in other cities has been changed slightly from the 
original 
the setting is moved from new york to the riottorn streets of 
the 1968 democratic national convention in chicago acoustics and 
choreography are a vast improvement over earlier attempts 
producers say 
this hair leary says simply is very much like the 80s 
high tech hippy

a man who feared that relatives of a 
murder victim were coming after him for retribution telephoned 
police sunday and confessed to the crime and also asked for 
protection officers said 
curtis pete anderson 47 of brookhaven township on long island 
was charged with seconddegree murder in the shooting death of 
leroy hughes 30 of shirley said suffolk county police officer 
susan romann 
hughes was shot at least twice in the upper torso in front of a 
delicatessen saturday evening romann said 
police spokeswoman linda cicalese said the shooting occurred 
after hughes opened his car door and brushed anderson with it 
anderson and hughes apparently had a continuing feud she said 
hughes managed to walk about a block but then collapsed she 
said 
a passing motorist found him at an intersection and took him to 
brookhaven memorial hospital where he was pronounced dead romann 
said 
police became aware of andersons possible involvement in the 
shooting from interviews with eyewitnesses and were trying to 
locate him when he dialed the 911 emergency number and told 
operators that he had killed a man romann said 
anderson also asked the operator to send police because he 
thought members of the victims family were outside his residence 
she said 
anderson claims he received phone calls saying there would be 
retribution from the family and he feared they would be on his way 
over to his house cicalese said but there seems to be no 
credence to his belief that they were outside his residence

residents of a subdivision turned out 
to help dig up their past as archaeologists began sifting through 
tons of dirt at a building site where 4000yearold indian tools 
have been found 
it gives us a chance to look back and see part of our 
heritage said jeff mcbride a high school senior earning extra 
credit in his geology class by helping with the excavation 
alan leventhal director of the project under the auspices of 
san jose state university said the community is getting a chance 
to see things most have only heard about before the volunteers 
began helping out saturday and are expected to continue at the job 
for about a month 
most of them would never even get a look at an excavation and 
would hear about one only if there is controversy he said 
some of the volunteers are ohlone indians possibly descendants 
of the ohlone tribe that used the site to harvest and prepare food 
a bulldozer two weeks ago turned up several stone tools 
including mortars and pestles and rocks used for scraping and 
drilling 
the site is probably a halfdays walk from what was the nearest 
permanent ohlone settlement and is in an area where the indians 
would have found an abundance of acorns and game such as antelope 
and elk leventhal said 
the ground work for 23 homes has been halted until the 
archaeology team finishes

police arrested at least 50 people who gathered in 
moscow and leningrad on sunday to demand freedom for hundreds of 
people they say are in prisons and psychiatric hospitals for their 
beliefs a dissident said 
the protests came just days after soviet officials reportedly 
promised to release all political prisoners and after some members 
of the supreme soviet voted against tougher measures against public 
demonstrations 
dissidents designated sunday the 16th anniversary of the death 
in prison of poet yuri galanskov as the day on which they would 
commemorate soviet political prisoners 
leningrad police arrested 36 protesters who gathered near kazan 
cathedral along nevsky prospekt said yuri mityunov a spokesman in 
moscow for the democratic union which bills itself as an 
alternative to the communist party 
they were arrested without basis for holding candles and 
reading poetry mityunov said in a telephone interview 
at least 14 people were arrested in moscow he said no violence 
was reported in either city 
in moscow several hundred people milled across the street from 
pushkin square in the early evening mityunov said police and 
members of a new paramilitary force to control demonstrations used 
bullhorns to urge the crowd to disperse but did not interfere with 
the heated political discussions 
one man told by police to move off a step proclaimed he had a 
right to stand there marched in place and told a police officer 
im going im going he was not forced to move 
mityunov said five members of the democratic union were arrested 
before they reached pushkin square where they had planned to stage 
a demonstration he said two of the arrested were still held 
including one who raised a banner after most of the crowd left the 
area near the square 
mityunov said four other members of the democratic union who 
were arrested on their way to pushkin square appeared in court 
dissident sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
five members of the initiative group for holding demonstrations and 
meetings also were arrested near pushkin square when they raised 
banners in support of political prisoners 
last week west german chancellor helmut kohl told reporters in 
moscow after meetings with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev that 
the soviet union promised to release within 10 weeks everyone 
regarded in the west as a political prisoner 
the soviet union says it only considers a few dozen people 
political prisoners but western sources and dissidents estimate 
that several hundred people are in prisons camps psychiatric 
hospitals or exiled from their homes because of their beliefs 
we have very little faith that all political prisoners will be 
freed mityunov said there is a very big difference between 
what the authorities promise and what they actually do 
on friday some members of the supreme soviet voted against 
decrees giving paramilitary forces broad powers to control 
demonstrations and requiring advance approval from authorities for 
public protests 
although the measures passed easily with 1348 votes the 31 
no votes were the first dissident votes in memory in the 
supreme soviet

president mikhail s gorbachev says hes had 
enough of meetings and sloganeering and that its time for soviet 
society to get down to work 
speaking to a gathering of the young communist league or 
komsomol gorbachev expressed his impatience with the slow pace of 
reform under his policy of perestroika or restructuring 
society has been engaging in meetings for too long he said 
saturday meetings slogans and criticisms should be followed by 
acts which would set the policy and the entire potential of society 
into motion 
gorbachevs remarks were distributed late saturday by the 
official news agency tass they appeared to signal the soviet 
leaders impatience to get the country moving rather than any 
disenchantment with the more open atmosphere he has fostered 
his policy of glasnost or greater openness has encouraged more 
open public debate and a wideranging reevaluation of soviet 
history and future prospects 
at the same time his efforts to reform the countrys economy 
have not yet improved living standards for soviet citizens 
gorbachevs stated goal 
gorbachev stressed to the young communists who were marking the 
70th anniversary of their organization that perestroika will work 
only if they work 
what should be done for the processes of perestroika to gather 
momentum and unfold on a larger scale it is essential to do 
concrete work in each work collective in each town and village 
relying on glasnost and democracy on everthing which has 
democratized economic life and on what is taking place in the 
political process of the country he said 
gorbachev boosted his position in the soviet leadership a month 
ago by assuming the presidency when andrei a gromyko retired and 
by streamlining the communist party bureaucracy with his supporters 
in key positions 
he said few oppose his reforms but that the reforms are 
proceeding slowly because people are being asked to find new 
approaches and revive values forgotten in the corrupt and stagnant 
atmosphere permitted by his predecessors 
tass reported that in answer to questions gorbachev said the 
government is working on a law that will regulate the activities of 
volunteer societies and that it probably will be approved next 
spring 
it is likely that independent political organizations like the 
peoples front movements that have sprung up in the baltic 
republics of estonia lithuania and latvia would be included under 
such a law 
gorbachev said the question of komsomol membership on the 
policymaking communist party central committee should be 
considered soon 
in answer to another question gorbachev rejected procedures for 
regulating the social makeup of the communist party the soviet 
leader said an individuals ideas were much more important

an army unit that liberated one of the 
nazi regimes worst concentration camps during world war ii was 
honored by the united states holocaust memorial council 
the citation was presented saturday night at a reunion of former 
members of the 20th armored division which liberated germanys 
dachau extermination camp on april 29 1945 
the idea for a citation came from pat goitein of peoria ill 
the daughter of a division member tanker stanley rea ostler who 
had hoped to attend the reunion at a louisville hotel but her 
father died oct 13 in north muskegon mich at the age of 75 
i always knew what they her fathers division did at 
dachau mrs goitein said when i heard they were having a 
reunion i said daddy you guys were heroes i wanted to see 
them get an award from the holocaust commission i dont want 
people to forget 
dachau established in 1933 was one of the first concentration 
camps the nazis set up inside germany ten miles from munich it 
was the site of about 3500 brutal medical experiments thousands 
more jews and political prisoners were executed or died of 
starvation and illness us forces liberated about 32000 
prisoners from the camp 
mrs goitein was born april 4 1945 while her fathers unit was 
on its way toward the camp 
she said she and her father were working on the citation right 
up to his death 
the last thing he said to me was do you have any news 
this business has been a very tricky and very personal 
thing she said in a telephone interview last week by the time 
he died he knew we had it pretty well lined up and that really 
made him happy 
the proclamation signed by president reagan and holocaust 
council chairman harvey meyerhoff was presented by rabbi robert 
slosberg president of the louisville board of rabbis 
retired army col james m snyder the reunions chief 
organizer accepted the award saturday night then handed it to 
fort knox chief of staff col donald w williams for submission in 
the patton museum at fort knox 
snyder 74 a major at the time of the liberation said the 
division was moving toward munich when it came across the camp 
i had no prior knowledge of it the camp he said i 
dont know if anybody had 
snyder said the camp guards surrendered without much resistance 
the division stayed long enough for the military government to take 
over the camp then moved on to munich 
he said the gis had little contact with the prisoners 
they were in horrible shape he said 
just after liberating the camp the division met with an ss 
antitank group defending munich and suffered a considerable 
number of casualties the unit received a distinguished unit 
citation for the engagement 
sam eskenazi public affairs director for the holocaust council 
in washington said between 12 and 15 units liberated nazi camps 
certificates of appreciation have been sent to these units he 
said and flags of the units have been collected 
there will be a place of honor for these flags at the united 
states holocaust museum he said the museum to be built near 
the washington monument in washington dc is expected to be 
opened in 1992

unmediated peace talks between iran and iraq 
resume monday in an effort to consolidate the precarious truce and 
disengage troops in the 8yearold persian gulf war 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar flew to geneva 
sunday and said he hoped for substantive progress on an exchange of 
prisoners held by the two countries 
each country released 25 prisoners of war sunday but still hold 
thousands of others 
iraq freed 25 disabled iranian prisoners and they were flown to 
tehran the capital of iran aboard a plane chartered by the 
international red cross iran reciprocated immediately by releasing 
25 iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight 
to baghdad iraq according to francoise derand a spokesman at the 
red cross office in geneva 
in a brief chat with reporters after his arrival perez de 
cuellar said he hoped the meetings in geneva would be if possible 
much more useful than the 10day round early this month in new 
york 
perez de cuellar last week named withdrawal of the forces as his 
first priority in the new negotiations 
urgency to his efforts was added by a report warning that forces 
remain in dangerous proximity after eight years of fighting 
that has killed or wounded an estimated 15 million 
the report by the un iraniraq military observer group warned 
of constant danger of renewed fighting between the two sides whose 
soldiers are separated in some places by only 30 feet 
a ceasefire has been in effect since aug 20 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati and his iraqi 
counterpart tariq aziz have said no progress was made on the 
principal issue stalemating the talks since they began in geneva 
aug 25 the delineation of a border between the two nations 
iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the 
shattalarab waterway iraqs only navigable outlet to the sea 
iraq which rejected the treaty in 1980 demands sovereignty 
over the entire waterway 
other disputed stretches line the more than 800milelong 
frontier according to un sources they say the discrepancies 
have impeded an exact definition of the internationally 
recognized boundaries to which the two countries are to withdraw 
under the unmediated ceasefire 
the resolution calls for a permament ceasefire withdrawal of 
troops to the prewar border and the repatriation of pows 
last month 72 disabled iraqis were freed by iran and 
repatriated the first such operation since the ceasefire 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi prisoners of war in 
iran and 19284 iranian prisoners in iraq the united nations 
estimates iran and iraq hold a combined total of up to 105000 pows 
iraq has freed 638 war prisoners and iran 790 including the 50 
released sunday according to the red cross

president augusto pinochet who survived a 
1986 assassination attempt said claims by the opposition that he 
is the only obstacle to restoring democracy may lead to another 
attempt on his life 
enemies are aiming at me they have me in the sight the 
official orbe news agency quoted him as saying sunday 
on saturday pinochet 72 spoke to several hundred supporters 
in inquique 1150 miles north of santiago 
in his first provincial tour since he lost an oct 5 referendum 
aimed at extending his 15year rule to 1997 the rightwing army 
commander repeated his rejection of opposition demands that he 
leave office before his term expires 
opposition parties claim that i represent the only hurdle for 
the restoration of full democracy and they are trying to separate 
me from the armed forces and isolating me pinochet said 
i publicly warn that these attempts may lead even to my 
physical elimination he said 
orbe quoted pinochet as saying sunday i know they are aiming 
at me they have me in the sight when asked about his reference 
to a possible assassination attempt 
but the news agency said he refused to elaborate that would 
be disclosing to them what we already know he was quoted as 
saying 
on sep 7 1986 pinochets motorcade was ambushed in the andes 
foothills near santiago five of his bodyguards were killed and 11 
wounded a leftist guerrilla organization claimed responsibility 
in the referendum chileans rejected a proposal by pinochet and 
the other military commanders that he remain in power until 1997 
according to the 8yearold constitution the defeat forces 
pinochet to call an open election planned for december 1989 he 
must hand power to the winner in march 1990 
but opposition leaders are pressing for constitutional changes 
including a more speedy departure of pinochet they say his refusal 
to step down and allow earlier elections makes him the only 
obstacle to full democracy 
in his speech saturday pinochet again vowed not to yield to the 
opposition demands and said he will strictly follow the 
constitution 
no democracy will be possible if we break the law he said 
some opposition leaders have said a hard line by pinochet is 
designed to provoke street demonstrations or other radical action 
that would justify repression 
pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that toppled the elected 
government of president salvador allende a marxist who died in 
the takeover

lots of guys dont like to wear 
ties but for bill webb there is a principal as well as a school 
superintendent involved 
the officials say the high school math teacher is insubordinate 
webb who has been suspended three times and may lose his job for 
violating the school dress code counters that its not what you 
wear but what and how you teach 
he said officials ought to be more concerned about the biology 
classroom a onetable lab where running water was installed just 
four years ago or the mens faculty lounge a former restroom 
where plywood paneling over the urinals is called a bench 
weve spent over two months on a dress code issue thats not 
important but we have not instituted a single new educational 
program for the students of mason county said webb a 
jeansandcottonshirt man who also raises cattle 
but how teachers look is important to county schools 
superintendent charles chambers 
we expect our teachers to set a good example for our children 
if you arent going to follow the rules set by your school board 
how can you expect your students to follow regulations chambers 
said 
webb 46 has taught upperlevel math at point pleasant high 
school for 20 years often from collegelevel textbooks and once 
wore a coat and tie so he could be distinguished from his students 
as ive gotten older i dont need to make that distinction 
and i dont think ive had a tie on in 15 years said webb who 
teaches 124 of the 695 students at the school in this rural ohio 
river county of 28000 
students are more productive in a relaxed atmosphere webb said 
explaining that going without a tie helps them relate to him 
this year in a memo given to teachers after they had signed 
their contracts chambers said every male faculty member would have 
to wear a tie in class 
the first time webb refused he was suspended for four days with 
pay the next time he was suspended for 11 days without pay on 
friday he received another suspension for up to 30 days beginning 
monday 
the school board on nov 7 will decide whether the latest 
suspension is with or without pay chambers said webb is a good 
teacher and he would like to see him stay but not unless he puts 
on a tie 
three teachers have filed grievances and others tried to make a 
mockery of the rule they wore outlandish ties some festooned with 
clowns flowers or fish but they gave way after the board issued 
written reprimands 
those who reluctantly comply wear black ribbons made by webbs 
daughter and wife 
point pleasant high schools accreditation by the north central 
association of colleges and secondary schools is evidence that 
appearance is no indication of what goes on inside webb said 
essentially it said that in spite of the lack of facilities 
they thought we had an effective high school and it wasnt 
because we were wearing ties webb said sitting on the bench in 
the faculty room that smells like the boys bathroom it used to be 
they didnt care what you looked like they looked to see what 
you were doing with your kids webb said people who normally 
lack the capacity to have authority in a classroom could wear a 
suit of armor and they still wouldnt be in control 
webb said he is willing to give up teaching and return to his 
gallipolis ohio farm 
ill probably do some work around home thats been needed done 
for some time and draw unemployment for a while webb said 
im not sure if ill stay in education or possibly get a job in 
an industrial plant or even maybe an outdoor job i can run a 
bulldozer 
principal michael whalen said hes willing to let webb go 
you can always be replaced by somebody who can do a better 
job whalen said once you start thinking youre irreplaceable 
youve got trouble

a municipal court judge intervened 
twice this year in other courts to free the stepdaughter of a 
wealthy friend in the guggenheim family a newspaper reported 
sunday 
harbor municipal judge calvin schmidt countermanded the 
decisions by other judges who had decided that terri ann mcmullen 
should post bail on cocaine possession charges the register of 
orange county reported 
each time ms mcmullen was freed by schmidt she became a 
fugitive and was arrested by authorities the paper said 
she is now in custody on 250000 bail awaiting a preliminary 
hearing while various authorities investigate schmidts role in her 
case the register said 
ms mcmullen 28 is the stepdaughter of m robert guggenheim 
jr the greatgrandson of turnofthecentury industrialist meyer 
guggenheim the paper said 
guggenheim and the judge are close friends and members of the 
same social club they have also participated in the same charity 
functions the register said 
schmidt refused to comment guggenheim also refused to comment 
except to say the situation is utterly ridiculous 
the matter is being investigated by the district attorney and 
the state commission on judicial performance the newspaper said 
schmidt first released ms mcmullen on april 4 after she was 
arrested in an orange motel for alleged cocaine possession

jacksonville will never be completely 
free of bad smells its mayor admits a year after declaring war on 
the polluters that have given this city a malodorous reputation 
id like to say were going to be odorfree mayor tommy 
hazouri told the florida timesunion in a story published sunday 
what may be better said would be an odorproblem free city 
a year ago hazouri said jacksonville saddled with a stinky 
reputation for years would be odorfree in two years he said 
significant progress has been made since then 
were winning the war he said we have attacked on all 
fronts 
the city has been tougher on the industries that generate the 
unpleasant odors a city envirnomental ordinance has been 
strengthened citations have been issued against polluters and 
several offenders have been taken to court 
i couldnt ask for any more than what is being done short of 
putting out a magic wand and saying odor be gone hazouri 
said 
however the newspaper reported that the number of residents who 
have complained about odor has increased 917 percent in the past 
year 
jacksonville pollution officials say that finding doesnt 
signify that the odors are worse than before instead they said 
it indicates that the public is more aware of the problem and wants 
to help by reporting offenders 
when i talk about odorfree i wasnt trying to say we were 
going to be 100 percent hazouri told the paper im not by any 
means backtracking on what i said 
although every effort is being made to reduce odor industries 
can encounter equipment failures or weather conditions that create 
bad smells hazouri said

the war of the worlds radio drama 
about invading martians unleashed widespread hysteria in 1938 but 
similar public manipulation is happening all the time today 
says writer garrison keillor 
keillor creator of the prairie home companion radio series 
said 1938 was an innocent age compared to the present when some 
jaded cynical writers and politicians abandon objectivity in order 
to entertain with shock value and fear 
keillor said his uncle jim a gentle farmer who listened to a 
crystal headset radio in the bedroom of his minnesota farmhouse 
was his only relative who believed the broadcast 50 years ago 
sunday and thought the world was ending 
uncle jim was among up to 1 million americans who believed the 
halloween eve broadcast of orson welles mercury theatre of the air 
keillors prairie home companion series on american public 
radio included homespun reports on life in the fictional community 
of lake wobegon minn 
sunday ended a fourday celebration of the 50th anniversary of 
the war of the worlds broadcast by the community randomly 
chosen as the setting for the invasion by scriptwriter howard koch 
closing events included a theatrical production of the broadcast 
keillor applauded the offbeat celebration 
its a case of a community who was such a victim of the media 
50 years ago to have a chance to come back and exploit its 
victimization he said its a form of justice thats so rare 
keillor joined a psychology professor and a historian saturday 
to examine the question could it happen again 
its happening all the time keillor said for my uncle 
jim panic was an event and for us its a way of life 
he cited the medias emphasis on entertainment and its 
fascination with the bizarre and perverse 
he noted republican presidential candidate george bushs 
campaign commercials that portrayed democratic candidate michael 
dukakis as soft on crime by depicting criminals moving through a 
turnstile 
keillor said the engine of our politics has become fear of 
people who are different of drugs and of crime 
entertainers are after an effect journalists have another 
code of ethics and so should politicians they must be faithful 
to an objective reality he said adding that we have to insist 
on a difference 
keillor said the war of the worlds play by koch who later 
won an academy award for casablanca was ethically very 
questionable 
howard green a state historian and expert on depressionera 
history said the broadcast worked because radio was a trusted and 
comfortable medium during tumultuous times 
he said the stock market crash the depression technological 
leaps the threat of war and adolf hitlers rise to power bred 
insecurity fear and shame 
there was fear and there was radio green said the radio 
was a source of comfort and security in an upside down 
topsyturvy scary world 
joel cooper princeton universitys psychology chairman said 
1938 was a period of freefloating anxiety over economic and world 
events and the broadcast provided a specific event to which people 
could respond with an exact emotion fear 
he said the show included credible commentators and realistic 
news bulletins allowing listeners to abandon critical judgment and 
believe 
these are the same tactics used to sell us our toothpaste our 
diet pills and our presidential candidates cooper said

michael dukakis bragged sunday about the 
liberal tradition claimed that george bush was dead wrong in 
saying dukakis wanted to divide the country and challenged his 
rival to a debate on the eve of the election 
im going to be a president who unites america dukakis told 
reporters during a daylong train trip through californias central 
valley if he wants to talk about that then id be happy to meet 
him facetoface 
that showdown dukakis said could take place election eve 
during the hour of network television time purchased by the 
democratic and republican campaigns for lastminute appeals to 
voters a moderator would be present but the candidates not 
reporters would ask the questions 
dukakis convinced his campaign is surging in the waning days of 
the election contest delivered an impassioned defense of 
liberalism a subject he has largely ducked 
we need a president in the tradition yes the liberal 
tradition of franklin roosevelt and john kennedy dukakis told a 
depot rally in hanford a valley community surrounded by sprawling 
cotton farms 
he repeated that call at similar rallies in bakersfield and 
fresno adding former president harry s truman to his list of 
liberal democrats at those stops 
at the fresno news conference dukakis said he decided it was 
time to set the record straight after president reagan said last 
week that if truman was alive today he would support bush and the 
gop 
dukakis scoffed at reagans statement and said his fiscal 
conservatism and concern for children health care education the 
environment and average families put him squarely in the mold of 
roosevelt truman and kennedy 
thats the tradition of liberalism i grew up in dukakis 
said thats the tradition i believe in and im not going to let 
the republican party pervert that word and give it a meaning it 
doesnt have 
in an interview with the macneillehrer newshour dukakis 
said he objected to the manner in which bush has used the term to 
describe his opponent 
a way which i think is very deliberately designed to suggest 
that i and people like me dont have a sense of values that were 
kind of permissive that anything goes he said in the interview 
taped saturday and scheduled to air monday night 
yet at the sunday news conference dukakis refused to add less 
popular liberals george mcgovern jimmy carter and walter mondale 
to his list 
im not going to go through a litany of people who share 
that tradition dukakis said when asked about the latter group of 
democrats he did however refer to a recent joint appearance with 
carter 
dukakis drew large and enthusiastic crowds at each of the depot 
rallies taking time during each to speak in spanish to the large 
number of hispanics in the crowds 
as dukakis adopted a more combative tone in his trip through 
california he promised an administration with more backbone 
than the current one his campaign also was fighting back with new 
ads attacking the republican environmental record one commericals 
shows two beachgoers wearing gas masks with an oil rig just 
offshore 
recent public opinion polls show dukakis closing fast on bush in 
several key states including california a mustwin state where 
dukakis aides said an 11point bush lead a week ago has shrunk to a 
virtual tie 
nationwide a time magazine poll taken last week showed bush 
maintaining a 10point lead but dukakis aides said more recent 
tracking data showed the gap had narrowed to as little as six 
points 
assessing the campaign and its issues on nbcs meet the 
press sen bob dole rkan a prominent bush ally suggested 
that the republican nominees hardandfast promise not to raise 
taxes may be unrealistic 
dole a former gop presidential primary opponent of the vice 
president said he believed a federal budget can be worked out next 
year that could avoid increases in individual income tax rates but 
he noted that bush had made a sweeping vow not to raise federal 
revenues 
thats going to be a hard thing to accomplish said dole a 
former chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee 
maybe he can do it i hope he can i want to help him and ill 
be glad to support him and lead the effort but i wouldnt say 
theres a 100 percent chance we can do it 
dole also was asked whether bush was continuing to dodge 
questions which dole had asked during his primary campaign 
about the irancontra affair and us relations with panamas 
indicted military leader manuel noriega 
well i dont know dole said i dont know what he does 
know only he knows and maybe hell tell us some day 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen in a 
statement released by the dukakis campaign said doles comments 
reminded him of bushs vow not to raise taxes 
what he bush really means is read my lips ill say what it 
takes to get elected bentsen said 
responding to doles comments about taxes the vice president 
told reporters he knows what i said and what i believe and im 
just going to do my best but first i want to win this election 
thats the key 
bush attended a private mass at the residence of cardinal john 
krol and later visited italianamerican supporters in suburban 
norristown 
his chief of staff craig fuller said the bush campaign will 
concentrate in its final week on states where the margin is close 
including ohio california and illinois 
unlike his boss fuller did not dispute that the race was 
narrowing but he said it was not a matter for concern 
i think its to be expected as you get to the final days of 
the campaign that youre going to see some tightening in this 
race fuller said but thats going to cause to us to work 
harder well not allow ourselves to lose the edge weve had as a 
campaign team 
dukakis held bush personally responsible for republican campaign 
literature being circulated in maryland that pictured dukakis 
standing next to willie horton jr the convicted murderer who 
raped a maryland woman and slashed her fiance after he escaped from 
a massachusetts prison furlough 
the fundraising letter asks is this your profamily team for 
1988 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii appearing on the 
cbstvs face the nation repudiated the flier and said it was 
totally out of bounds and totally unauthorized 
baker said it was not bushs fault you cannot control every 
party organization throughout the country he said 
bush planned to make several television appearances this week 
including taping an interview with nbcs tom brokaw on monday and 
appearing live on the nbc today show on thursday said 
spokeswoman sheila tate 
baker said the campaign also is considering invitations for bush 
and his vice presidential running mate sen dan quayle of indiana 
to be interviewed by cbs anchorman dan rather

three tickets were sold with the six 
numbers needed to win californias 608 million lottery jackpot 
the largest in the world officials said sunday 
each of the tickets is worth a third of the jackpot a pool of 
15 hospital workers in san diego county jubilantly claimed sunday 
that it held one of the winning tickets however lottery spokesman 
bob taylor said he could not confirm that until the ticket stub is 
verified probably on monday 
the two other tickets with the six winning numbers were 
purchased in westminster in orange county and in sacramento taylor 
said winners in those areas had not come forward 
workers at fallbrook hospital told the associated press they 
went together to purchase 600 worth of tickets 
carrie dragon a 38yearold pharmacy technician said she 
joined 13 nurses lab technicians and other hospital employees as 
well as a friend of one worker in putting 40 each toward the 
tickets 
she said all agreed they would split what winnings came from the 
quick pick tickets quick pick means that the numbers were 
selected at random by one of the computerized lotto terminals 
the tickets were purchased at a circle k convenience store she 
said lottery officials verified that the winning ticket in 
fallbrook was purchased at a circle k 
the hospital workers in the pool held a party to watch saturday 
nights drawing 
the lady who found we had a winning ticket screamed said 
dragon everybody was just amazed then everybody started 
dreaming about what we were going to do with the money 
im going to set up trust funds for my four kids and pay off 
bills she said but for thanksgiving were all going to go to 
hawaii or some place like that 
she said the ticket was placed in a bank vault 
lottery spokeswoman susan kossack said each winner will receive 
20296175 a third of the 60888525 jackpot in installments 
over 20 years the installments will amount to 810666 annually 
after taxes she said 
if verified the hospital pool ticket would be worth more than 
67600 annually before taxes for 20 years to each of the 15 
people the lottery pays out only to a single winner the person 
holding the winning ticket arrangements for dividing the money 
would be the responsibility of the group 
dragon said two hospital workers duff stone and charlie jett 
bought the tickets for the group an unidentified woman who 
answered the telephone at stones home said reporters would have to 
wait to talk to the winners at a lottery office on monday 
the winning numbers selected in the televised saturday night 
drawing were 5 20 26 28 32 and 39 the bonus number was 3 
the jackpot was the worlds largest lottery prize according to 
taylor 
the previous world record jackpot was 56 million in spains el 
gordo lottery in 1983 according to sam valenza publisher of 
lottery players magazine in moorestown nj but in spains 
lottery players dont choose their numbers which are already 
printed on tickets and several winning entries are guaranteed in 
each of the five or six drawings held each year 
the previous north american record was a 5516 million jackpot 
in a florida lottery last month that prize went to a single winner 
saturdays california drawing climaxed a week of frenzied lotto 
ticket buying throughout the state with gamblers wagering about 
106 million taylor said 
all these figures are records kossack added 
saturdays sales hit 395 million officials said at 632 pm 
saturday the high sales point more than 86000 tickets were being 
sold each minute in the heaviest hour from 5 pm to 6 pm 
saturday about 43 million of the 1 tickets were sold 
the saturday jackpot soared because on wednesday for the fourth 
consecutive time nobody picked the six winning numbers between 1 
and 49 wednesdays 334 million jackpot was rolled over to the 
saturday game and grew with each ticket sale 
residents of nevada which has legalized gambling but no state 
lottery accounted for some of the sales officials said 
the busiest store saturday was in the sierra nevada community of 
truckee 20 miles southwest west of reno nev with sales of 
47652 
for the week the busiest retailer was a store in baker 80 
miles southwest of las vegas that has only one lotto sales 
terminal but logged 162014 in sales 
lottery tickets with five winning numbers plus the bonus number 
will pay 261977 each to 29 players while five numbers without 
the bonus will pay 3742 each to 1046 players said taylor

a farmer representing tennessee in the 
1000mile trail of tears commemorative wagon train says he is 
having to drop out of the project because state officials failed to 
keep a promise of financial aid 
state officials said no one promised any money 
norman fowler of camden said he returned home last week after 
entering missouri because he simply couldnt afford to go on 
the state said they would fund a tennessee train so i said i 
would do it fowler said they kept saying to stay with it and 
the money would come but it never did 
the wagon train set out sept 17 from red clay tenn for 
talequah okla to mark the 150th anniversary of the forced 
removal of cherokee indians from their homes in the east by the 
journeys end the train will have traveled through those states 
plus kentucky illinois missouri and arkansas 
luvenia butler executive director of the tennessee indian 
commission said sunday no state official ever promised fowler 
financial aid 
he was a diabetic and he was getting sick and because there 
was no money he physically wanted to come home butler said 
no one on the behalf of the state of tennessee has ever promised 
norman fowler a penny 
she said one of the organizers of the project had promised 
fowler the state would help 
fowler said he used about 2000 of his own money and 1000 in 
contributions but needs about 8000 to finish the journey which 
is scheduled to end dec 3 
i would like to rejoin them and its a shame tennessee wont 
be represented he said but it gets expensive trying to keep 
up the wagon and animals plus buying food and all 
felix barnes of nashville national chairman of funding for the 
wagon train project said he set up an account at sovran bank in 
nashville to collect money for fowler 
its unfortunate that he has to come home due to lack of funds 
after the governor of the state declared this year the year of the 
native american indian barnes said norman was losing 800 a 
week pay to do this and using his own money because he had pride in 
the project 
barnes said other wagoners periodically join the train with as 
many as 40 wagons in the group at some times he estimated that 
about 200 wagons would take part in the wagon train by the time the 
journey is over

two sisters who shared a 315 million 
florida lottery jackpot have suddenly found themselves slapped with 
a lawsuit by the exhusband of one of the women and the man says 
all the money is his 
ellen snipes and maxine johnson produced the winning ticket for 
the oct 22 drawing they had made a weekly routine of playing the 
lotto contributing 5 each every week 
but lewis snipes argues that he bought and paid for the winning 
lotto ticket and his attorney filed a suit friday saying his 
client deserves the whole jackpot the states thirdlargest 
the sisters unnerved by the first legal battle over florida 
lotto winnings since the weekly drawing began last spring have 
left indiantown for security reasons attorney tim morell said 
saturday he represents mrs snipes and mrs johnson and her 
husband bill 
by all accounts snipes coaxed his exwife into playing the game 
oct 22 picked numbers off her old paycheck stub and drove to a 
store to buy the tickets his suit says he bought 15 worth of 
tickets for himself then made a special trip to buy with his own 
money 10 worth of tickets for his exwife and her sister 
morell said mrs snipes realizes her exhusband was the driving 
force behind her multimilliondollar windfall 
the sisters offered snipes more than 1 million their attorney 
said but he said the sisters did so out of gratitude not legal 
obligation 
he would have been a wealthy man but that wasnt enough 
morell said 
the snipeses were married in 1980 and divorced in 1982 but 
friends and family say they remain close as recently as tuesday 
when the johnsons and snipeses went to tallahassee to verify the 
winnings their relationship was amicable 
but by the end of the week snipes attorney andrew coutant 
had asked martin county circuit court for an emergency order to 
stop distribution of the money until a settlement is reached 
the first of 20 annual payments of 1570000 is scheduled to be 
wired to the first national bank of indiantown on wednesday 
its frightening what happens when you get into this sort of 
thing morell said you want your life to be the same but 
thats just not the way it is

police on sunday criticized a book 
written by a former police commissioner who once led the 
investigation into the assassination in 1986 of prime minister olof 
palme 
the newspaper expressen carried a report based on information 
from hans holmers book olof palme is shot which is scheduled 
for distribution soon 
holmer resigned as police commissioner late in 1986 during 
disputes with prosecutors about the fruitless search for palmes 
killers 
formal inquiries claimed police blunders had hampered the 
investigation and some prosecutors said the police commissioner 
had too much influence over the case 
in a murder investigation it is necessary to have secret 
material said ingvar eriksson spokesman for the units now 
involved in the investigation 
it makes it easier to check witness accounts he said 
here we have material never published before we would have 
preferred it if he had never written that book 
prosecutor jorgen almblad who is participating in the 
investigation said one problem with the book is it might give 
people the wrong idea about the status of the case 
holmers book could make many believe that what he writes is 
actually what the investigation is concentrating on almblad told 
swedish national radio 
the exressen account deals with a 30hour period before palme 
was shot to death while walking with his wife along a street in 
downtown stockholm on feb 25 1986 
holmer wrote about information given by people questioned in the 
case with some identified by name 
he describes a carefully planned plot by a small group and 
claims palme was shadowed by a muscular blond man the day before 
the murder 
according to holmer members of the group had been waiting for 
weeks for the right moment and when palme walked unguarded with 
his wife lisbet to a theater the conditions were perfect they 
had two hours to plan the murder 
holmer wrote that a gunman and accomplices with walkietalkie 
radios and escape cars were waiting as the palmes left the the 
theater and the killer came up from behind them shot the prime 
minister and fled down a dark side street 
police sources said recently investigators were following 
several leads including the possibilty that an insane man 
operating along might have killed palme

the president of afghanistans sovietbacked 
government called for an international conference to oversee the 
complete demilitarization of his country which has been torn apart 
by a 10year civil war tass reported 
the soviet news agency said president najib in a speech 
saturday to the national council or parliament also dismissed 
reports that he would step down soon 
taking into consideration that a large amount of various 
weapons have accumulated in the country over the 10 years of war 
and with a view to establishing a lasting peace such a conference 
can discuss the question of demilitarization of the republic of 
afghanistan tass said in a dispatch late saturday 
najib called for the gathering of all weapons available there 
and their transfer to the respective producer countries tass 
said 
najib requested that un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar prepare for a conference 
najibs sovietback government is fighting usbacked 
antimarxist insurgents operating from bases in neighboring 
pakistan 
in a separate report tass quoted the official afghan news 
agency bakhtar as saying 170 guerrillas were killed in recent 
fighting with government soliders 
the soviet union sent soldiers to afghanistan in december 1979 
who replaced one prosoviet government with another and then 
remained to fight the insurgents 
under a unsponsored agreement signed in geneva on april 14 
the 100000 soviet soldiers are to be withdrawn by feb 15 half 
the force was removed by aug 15 but the soviet union and 
afghanistan accuse the united states and pakistan of violating a 
pledge in the geneva agreement to stop interfering in afghanistan 
najib told the parliament his country would request an urgent 
meeting of the un security council to consider the question of 
the threat to the territorial integrity and national sovereignty 
which has developed as a result of pakistans interference and 
violation of the geneva agreements 
an international conference also could endorse and consolidate 
afghanistans status as a nonaligned and neutral country 
develop a program of economic and humanitarian aid and work out 
guarantees for the observance of human rights najib said 
tass said najib strongly dismissed rumors that he would 
resign soon saying he would never abandon the work for peace and 
security 
western diplomats have reported rumors in recent weeks that 
najib might be forced to step down by the soviets to pave the way 
for a government headed by a figure not connected with the ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
soviet and afghan officials have said they believe that a 
neutral political leader might encourage a truce with the moslem 
insurgents who have refused any power sharing deals with the 
communists 
najib also reportedly is threatened from within his own party in 
the traditional rift between his urban parcham wing and the rural 
khalq which dominates the military 
tass quoted bakhtar as saying government soldiers routed three 
bands of guerrillas in the area of tur kotal on friday killing 70 
and wounding more than 100 
another 100 insurgents were killed in fighting in kunduz and 
nangarhar provinces tass said 
it quoted bakhtar as saying two american five pakistani and 
five people from unidentified arab countries who were advising the 
rebels were killed it did not elaborate 
insurgent groups have been stepping up pressure on provincial 
capitals and on the national capital kabul itself as the soviet 
soldiers withdraw and afghan government forces are left to defend 
the cities shelling and rocket attacks have increased dramatically 
us officials in washington said saturday that the soviet union 
may be violating the geneva agreement by deploying up to 30 
highperformance mig27 ground support planes in western 
afghanistan 
the us officials said the soviet union has pledged only to 
protect its own soldiers from attack but that the mig27s can be 
used for offensive operations

life with janice meant heartache screaming bad 
food and a dead dog 
still huey maximilian bonfigliano wants an italian american 
reconciliation with his exwife even after that last straw her 
shooting of his favorite pooch with a zip gun its also the title 
of john patrick shanleys promising if messy romantic comedy which 
opened sunday at manhattan theater clubs stage ii 
shanleys plays always have generated more heat than light 
romantic warfare has been at the center of his danny and the deep 
blue sea a dramatic apache dance that ends with two exhausted 
lovers savage in limbo a bluecollar battle in a bronx bar 
and the dreamer examines his pillow a threecharacter struggle 
between a father his daughter and her boyfriend 
shanleys latest effort takes place in a romanticized little 
italy where people always seem to be slurping minestrone and where 
perry como mario lanza and puccini play in the background if you 
think the setting sounds a little like the movie moonstruck 
youre right shanley won an oscar for his screenplay only 
italian american reconciliation doesnt have the steady hand of 
director norman jewison to guide it through its shakiest moments 
the play focuses on hueys attempt to win back janice with the 
help of his best friend aldo scalicki aldo serves as the plays 
narrator bantering with the audience before the lights go down and 
explaining the dramatic situations before they happen hes also 
one of the plays problems hes more interesting than any of the 
people he is talking about particularly because of john turturros 
winning performance that mixes macho and meekness 
huey is something of a cipher while janice is something of a 
psychotic its not the fault of actors john pankow and jayne 
haynes that their characters simply are not as compelling and 
believable as the person who tells their story 
there are other better written plot complications 
before he can reconcile with janice huey must dump teresa a 
pretty waitress who really loves him aldo thinks huey should stay 
on with teresa so he decides to seduce janice himself the 
attempted seduction is played out on a moonlit ivycovered balcony 
designed by santo loquasto the scene provides turturro with a 
great opportunity to display some terrific physical comedy 
as teresa laura san giacomo possesses a sweetness that would 
seem to make her a clear winner in any contest with the shrewish 
and violent janice teresa is guided in her dealings with huey by 
her aunt may played by a wonderful character actress named helen 
hanft 
shanley has an ear for argument his banter is tough and often 
funny he can make exasperation sound like fun there is one 
blissful moment in the second act when aunt may and aldo discuss 
his fear of women characters and dialogue mesh for an inspired bit 
of lunacy as aunt may tells him how to overcome his problem 
but the author also directed the play and he allows it to 
ramble particularly in the opening scenes when huey expounds on 
his romantic dilemma to aldo it doesnt work and janices 
severity is never explained adequately shanley chalks up her 
troubles to her father the same source of aldos problems but 
the explanation is never convincing for such a strongwilled woman 
there still is work to be done on italian american 
reconciliation the playwright has created an affectionate and 
atmospheric tale of the search for love but his searchers need to 
be more defined and persuasively drawn before it can be considered 
a complete success

his replacement is a combat veteran popular with us military 
advisers 
blandon said late saturday that he will be succeeded by col 
rene emilio ponce a 41yearold brigade commander 
ponce was singled out as an exceptional commander by four us 
army lieutenant colonels earlier this year in a harvard fellowship 
analysis of the salvadoran civil war 
he has said victory in that war will go to those who gain the 
loyalty of the poor 
we cannot think that solely by military means we are going to 
resolve this war ponce said this year even if we kill all the 
subversives the problem will not end such deplorable 
socioeconomic conditions would remain that it insurgency could 
easily revive 
blandon 48 said he was appointed el salvadors military 
attache in france effective nov 1 named head of the joint chiefs 
of staff in november 1983 he had been expected to step down by 
years end 
he made his announcement in a local television interview 
broadcast saturday 
he said his transfer is not related to the political 
situation it is necessary to open spaces for new generations 
the usbacked government and leftist rebels are mired in an 
eightyear civil war rebel and government negotiators have met 
three times most recently in october 1987 in an unsuccessful bid 
to negotiate a ceasefire 
on sunday two rebel commanders arrived in panama city for talks 
with monsignor arturo rivera y damas the roman catholic archbishop 
of san salvador on the possible resumption of peace talks 
joaquin villalobos and leonel gonzalez said they would meet on 
monday with rivera y damas and monsignor emile stehle of west 
germany stehle has participated as an observer in previous 
governmentrebel talks 
blandon said the command change isnt going to bog us down or 
slow us colonel ponce is very qualified and capable 
ponce commands the 3rd infantry brigade and belongs to the 
tandona a tightknit block of officers who have consolidated 
control of the armed forces in recent months the colonels who 
graduated together from the national military academy in 1966 hold 
more than half the militarys 36 command posts 
blandon will leave the nation with a legacy of a larger 
military he increased its size to 50000 troops and accompanied 
president jose napoleon duarte in meetings with rebel leaders 
at the request of us military advisers blandon has increased 
use of small strike forces against guerrillas rather than sweeping 
offensives 
more than 65000 salvadorans mostly civilians have been killed 
in the civil war

president reagan vowed sunday that america 
will never forget the lessons of the holocaust pledging unswerving 
support for israel and to use force against any threat of 
fascism 
we must defend ourselves against the evil of 
totalitarianism reagan said in a speech to members of the simon 
wiesenthal center at its annual awards banquet 
we must remain strong and we must be willing to use force when 
we are under threat this is a lesson that binds us still closer to 
the state of israel for the fact is a strong israel depends upon 
a strong america reagan said 
an america that loses faith in the idea of a strong defense is 
an america that will lose faith in a nation at arms like israel 
reagan said 
declaring that monsters were responsible for the holocaust 
reagan said the mind reels from the enormity of the crime it 
begs to be set free from so terrible a fact to wipe it from the 
memory 
but people like simon wiesenthal have made us understand that 
we must not we cannot we will not reagan pledged 
the organization was founded in 1977 and named after the famed 
nazihunter it is dedicated to preserving the memory of the 
holocaust through which millions of jews died at the hands of 
adolf hitlers nazis 
the group presented reagan with its 1988 humanitarian award in 
recognition of his commitment to israel his work in defense of 
human rights on behalf of soviet jewry and the signing of the arms 
reduction treaty with the soviet union the white house said 
it also presented a separate and firstever award to nancy 
reagan for her antidrug abuse work among the nations youth 
in his address reagan lauded wiesenthal who was celebrating 
his 80th birthday at the event arrested by nazi forces in 1941 
wiesenthal escaped twice from concentration camps and was liberated 
by american forces in 1945 he and his wife cyla were the only 
two of 91 family members to survive the holocaust the white house 
said 
but out of the ashes of the holocaust there came a good thing 
a great thing called the state of israel and like simon 
wiesenthal the animating principles of the state of israel are 
justice and law tempered with compassion yes the very principles 
of judaism itself reagan said adding and we americans with 
our judeochristian heritage have no better friends than the 
people of israel 
reagan contending that his administration has made the ties 
that bind america and israel warmer than they ever have been 
also used the occasion to insert a political note 
contending that his administration has kept its pledge to make 
sure israel retained its qualitative edge in the middle east 
reagan noted that this record of friendship and fealty moved the 
democratic mayor of new york city to say that our 
administration was the best friend israel has ever had in the white 
house 
reagan did not refer to mayor ed koch by name 
the president also put in a call for a negotiated settlement to 
the middle easts turmoil 
that same strength and resolve coupled with diplomatic 
vision and a commitment to political reconciliation are essential 
if israel is to help achieve a negotiated settlement among the 
warweary peoples of the middle east he said 
reagan and his wife who spent the weekend at their 688acre 
santa barbara ranch were remaining in los angeles on monday 
the president was scheduled to make some campaign commercials 
and attend meetings dealing with his presidential library

a remarkable reconstruction of a 1932 george 
balanchine ballet from 1932 has been done for and by the joffrey 
ballet its as though pieces of a jigsaw puzzle carried to four 
continents were hunted down and put back together 
however on seeing cotillon the ball sunday night at the 
city center the story of the reconstruction seemed more 
interesting than the ballet 
its a narrative ballet that presents incidents but doesnt tell 
a story name any character or sustain one mood many of 
balanchines movement motifs in it were not carried into his later 
work 
in the ballet a young girl tina leblanc is primping in the 
ballroom a young man the quicksilver edward stierle comes in 
they dance guests enter jerel hilding the master of ceremonies 
rushes in late when hes on stage flirting or dancing he looks 
simultaneously harried dashing and goofy 
two men carry in a pole from which hangs a curtain glenn 
edgerton enters womens whitegloved hands appear above the 
curtain hes to choose a partner but a blackgloved hand beatriz 
rodriguez as fate grabs him she twirls around him in interesting 
variations in a lesser choreographer this would be just 
posturing balanchine also adds an undercurrent of menace 
five groups of three women dance in a wheel the young girl 
tells fortunes by looking at gloved palms sees an ominous one the 
dance ends with the young girl dancing and two circles the men and 
the women going around her 
robert joffrey who died earlier this year worked toward 
reconstruction of cotillon for 10 years it was one of three 
ballets that balanchine created for the ballets russes when it was 
reorganized in monte carlo in 1932 except for the hand of fate pas 
de deux which roman jasinski had danced and later staged for the 
tulsa ballet theater it hadnt been danced since the early 1940s 
drs millicent hodson and kenneth archer went to indianapolis

democratic nominee michael dukakis 
brimming with confidence in his surging candidacy said sunday hes 
got republican rival george bush on the run while a bush ally 
raised questions about the vice presidents promise not to raise 
taxes 
kicking off a daylong train tour through californias central 
valley dukakis sounded more like a frontrunner than an underdog 
he predicted he would overtake bush before the nov 8 election 
and after weeks of being hammered by republicans for being a 
liberal he defiantly declared yes im a liberal in the 
tradition of franklin roosevelt and and harry truman and john 
kennedy 
recent public opinion polls show dukakis closing fast on bush in 
several key states including california a mustwin state where 
dukakis aides said an 11point bush lead a week ago has shrunk to a 
virtual tie

even as michael dukakis insists there is time 
to score an upset in the nov 8 balloting many democrats already 
are secondguessing his campaign strategy in anticipation of 
another national election defeat 
after the election this may be the campaign considered the 
worst managed in this century said democratic sen terry sanford 
of north carolina 
like many people in his party sanford insisted he thought 
dukakis still had a chance to defeat republican nominee george 
bush but he didnt sound overly optimistic 
id bet money on it he said of the chances of a dukakis 
upset but i wouldnt bet my law license on it

after losing ground to its neighbors 
louisville is finally shaking off the lingering effects of the last 
recession with the help of public and private investment 
a recent survey of louisville and 14 comparison cities shows 
that for the first half of this year the louisville area has 
generated more highpaying jobs than other regional competitors 
the list includes indianapolis cincinnati nashville tenn 
richmond va and kansas city mo 
coming out of the recession louisvilles growth was quite 
small relative to the other cities said paul cooms an economist 
with the bureau of economic research at the university of 
louisville which conducted the survey 
indianapolis for example enjoyed a rapid renaissance as new 
hotels skyscrapers and athletic facilities such as the hoosier 
dome gave the city a new vigor 
louisville on the other hand had a tough time overcoming the 
closed factories and lost jobs following the recessions 
but in the last two to three years louisville has finally 
recovered strongly cooms said louisville is a good market 
and people know it 
i dont know how much you want to make out of two quarters of 
data but certainly weve recovered well cooms said 
civic leaders agree the most recent tangible evidence that the 
city is on the move they say was saturdays dedication of the new 
national headquarters of the presbyterian church usa 
louisville won the headquarters at the churchs 1987 assembly in 
biloxi miss by scoring a conventionfloor upset over kansas 
city which had been recommended by the churchs site selection 
committee 
louisville had been ruled out as a site until a local 
businessman offered to donate two turnofthecentury warehouses 
worth 1 million on the citys waterfront community pledges of 7 
million more were made to renovate the buildings and the city 
offered a parking garage and rebuilt streets 
in addition major banks offered a 25 million revolving loan 
fund at favorable rates 
mayor jerry abramson said persuading the presbyterians to come 
to louisville showed people in this community that when we work 
together in a cooperative way we can compete with anybody at any 
level 
that is the idea behind the campaign for greater louisville a 
largely businessbacked organization that has raised more than 10 
million and plans to strengthen and expand existing businesses to 
create new local businesses and to attract outside business to the 
area 
the campaigns first expenditure two months ago went toward the 
proposed 300 million expansion of louisvilles standiford field 
two new parallel runways are to be built displacing thousands of 
residents as well as businesses and churches 
i cant think of a more important economicdevelopment step 
this campaign can take at this point in time campaign chairman 
george n gill president and publisher of the louisville 
courierjournal said then 
abramson who is also pushing the airport expansion believes 
another key to continued downtown development despite stiff 
competition from the suburbs and a stagnant population rests with 
providing incentives to counter a loss of federal aid 
local government with the help of federal dollars invested 
heavily in downtown from 1970 to the early 1980s now that federal 
support has dropped off local government is concentrating on 
projects that support economic development and make downtown more 
attractive 
and civic leaders have returned to the citys oldest and 
greatest asset the ohio river as the major source of downtown 
revitalization 
administrations before me studied it and studied it what we 
decided to do was take some risks and start to develop the 
waterfront abramson said 
now hundreds of millions of dollars in new and planned 
construction are taking place within blocks of the rivers edge 
but cooms said louisvilles continued growth is conditional upon 
the us economys continuing to expand and favorable exchange and 
interest rates 
the average life of an economic recovery is only about four 
years and were now finishing the sixth year so it should make 
some people nervous cooms said 
one national survey said the population of the metropolitan area 
has declined from about 970000 on jan 1 1987 to about 966000 
on jan 1 of this year causing the area to slip from 48th to 50th 
place as a national market 
that may not bode well for the citys ability to attract large 
companies and national advertising dollars particularly if the 
slide continues because many decisions are made on the basis of a 
metropolitan areas ranking in the nations top 50 markets

the halfdozen high rollers who boarded the 
corporate jet and headed west for the glittering city with fast 
action werent gamblers they were shoppers 
the junket didnt go to las vegas but to seattle for a shopping 
spree at nordstrom an upscale clothing chain with a reputation for 
customer service 
the flying shoppers breakfasted on fresh strawberries and orange 
juice and dabbed their wrists with samples of perfume as the small 
jet skimmed high over the cascade mountains 
nordstrom may have outdone itself with the allexpensespaid jet 
flight for some of its best yakima customers 
what it did for me was reinforce the idea that i am shopping 
in the right place said charlene franklund one of the customers 
who made the oct 12 trip 
i suggested they go to san francisco next time she added 
i can go to seattle anytime 
but rarely in such highflying comfort aboard a sleek 
12seater with a cabin attendant plus taxi service from boeing 
field to downtown and a personal salesperson for the entire day 
the shopping adventure included lunch beside elliott bay and 
gourmet cookies for the flight home 
they really did treat us very nicely ms franklund said 
with a sigh 
seattlebased nordstrom inc has made a splash in recent years 
with trendy stores and classy service that includes a hasslefree 
return policy the company has 42 department stores most of them 
on the west coast although it also operates in utah virginia and 
is opening a store in new jersey next spring 
most recently nordstrom made news by opening a 67 million 
336000squarefoot store in san francisco 
in the fiscal year that ended jan 31 nordstrom had sales of 
192 billion and profits of 927 million 
while yakima has a 44000square foot nordstrom store of its 
own the selection cant compete with some of the huge seattle 
stores 
some customers suggested the trip and yakima manager juliana 
dennis arranged for the 140mile flight to the big city 
they are customers that do come in frequently and spend a lot 
of money with us ms dennis said 
she declined to say how much the shoppers spent but despite the 
costs of the corporate jet the elegant lunch and transportation in 
seattle it was worth the effort she said 
it benefited everyone she said not only the customer but 
us as well 
originally a onetime trip the company is now considering 
additional trips from yakima because of customer demand she said 
the national retail merchants association in new york city 
noted that some major department stores have programs to reward 
frequent shoppers 
some stores do bus people around said spokesman john gary 
who added that dallasbased neiman marcus is the only other 
department store they had heard of that flies customers to stores 
its done ad hoc from time to time confirmed jan roberts a 
spokeswoman for neiman marcus 
it is fairly common for nordstrom stores to organize bus trips 
for people from outlying areas 
she said there were no spending minimums for those who went on 
the seattle trip and no invitations were issued customers only 
had to ask to be included she said 
the customers were accompanied by salespeople from the yakima 
store and the rackfull of clothing they selected was brought back 
on the plane to be rung up in yakima ms dennis said 
while royalty and movie stars may be used to jetliner shopping 
sprees the average department store customer is not because of 
that the company had hoped to keep the yakima trips a secret said 
corporate spokeswoman kellie tormey 
we cant make it trips available to everyone she said in 
a telephone interview from seattle this was a specific situation 
where the request came from the customers to do this thing 
were not going to be able to do it in every region ms 
tormey said in declining to provide additional information 
for ms franklund the flight was just a more convenient way to 
make a shopping trip she frequently makes anyway 
i didnt spend any money i wouldnt have otherwise spent 
she said

the us governmentowned 
overseas private investment corporation opic has signed an accord 
with the united arab emirates for protecting overseas investments 
from political risks officials said sunday 
the accord approved after six years of negotiations will allow 
opic to compensate american investors for losses caused by 
political crises the officials said 
the uae a member of the gulf cooperation council was the 
fifth of the gcc members to sign the accord after saudi arabia 
qatar oman and bahrain kuwait the sixth gcc member also was 
expected to sign a similar agreement 
the accord was negotiated by robert c osullivan assistant 
general counsel for claims at opic and donald a roberts the 
first secretary for economics at the american embassy in abu dhabi 
such an agreement will break the psychological barrier 
preventing american investors from operating in the uae 
osullivan told the associated press this is a proof of the 
friendly relations between the us and the uae 
since 1971 opic has served as the key us agency for 
encouraging american business investment in developing countries 
through providing american investors with insurance against certain 
political risks loan guarantees direct loans to small business 
and cooperatives and a variety of preinvestment programs 
all these are designed to reduce the perceived stumbling risks 
and blocks associated with overseas investment osullivan said 
in the past 17 years opic has settled about 215 insurance 
claims totalling 465 million its premiums are based on the nature 
of the investors undertaking and the risk profile of the project 
not on the country where the investment is launched he said

in a decision dismaying to power companies 
throughout the country the government has told a wisconsin utility 
that planned repairs to a coalburning power plant will subject it 
to strict air pollution standards for new plants 
utilities are worried because they fear the decision the first 
of its kind could apply to hundreds of plants if so utilities 
say they might have to close old plants forgo needed repairs or 
incur huge expenses to meet the standards 
the energy department says the decision could jeopardize future 
power supplies but environmentalists say the federal government 
should have enforced the standards years ago to improve air quality 
the environmental protection agencys decision marks the first 
time the federal government has intervened in renovations at a coal 
plant in the past epa has not become involved because state 
authorities administering the federal clean air act have never 
brought such projects to the agencys attention wisconsin is the 
first to do so 
epa said the wisconsin electric power cos port washington 
plant near milwaukee should be covered by new plant air standards 
because renovation work will result in an increase in current 
emissions of several pollutants including sulfur dioxide a major 
cause of acid rain 
epa administrator lee m thomas said the agency is working on a 
policy to cover past renovations at coal plants since the clear air 
act was written in 1971 the agency is considering what steps may 
be necessary to address previous projects he said in a letter to 
the company 
this will be setting a precedent for the entire country 
said bob beck environmental manager for the edison electric 
institute trade association for the nations private utilities 
wisconsin electric which had planned to spend about 71 million 
to replace cracked steam drums says the work is routine 
maintenance and should not trigger tougher air standards for new 
plants 
under epas pollution guidelines it could cost the company 800 
million to fix the plant industry analysts say 
edwin r anthony spokesman for the trade group said the nation 
has 821 coalfired generating units of which 360 are smaller than 
200 megawatts my guess is that most of these smaller plants 
are over 35 years old he said 
utilities are increasingly relying on life extension 
projects to keep old plants running plants with a tax life of 30 
years can be used for 60 years with careful renovation 
the energy department says as much as 25 percent of the nations 
fossil fuel capacity is produced at plants that are older than 30 
years that number will jump to 90 percent in in 2010 
port washington has five 80megawatt units between the ages of 
38 and 53 years the company would like to keep the plant running 
until 2010 instead of retiring the last unit in 1999 
obviously it could throw a monkey wrench into our plans 
said wisconsin electric spokeswoman lisa fox in milwaukee we 
need the capacity 
j allen wampler assistant secretary of energy for fossil 
energy wrote epa its decision could result in aggravating an 
expected shortfall in electric generating capacity in the 1990s or 
at best in the construction of less economical methods of 
generating electricity 
the most important air standard covers sulfur dioxide emissions 
a principal raw material for acid rain port washington now burns 
coal emitting 25 pounds of sulfur for every million btus provided 
a new plant is limited to between 06 and 12 pounds and must 
remove 70 percent to 90 percent of the sulfur in the coal 
as a practical matter the only way for an old plant to comply 
with the standards is to install smokestack scrubbers which 
industry analysts say could cost about 800 million at port 
washington 
wisconsin electric power co and the epa are discussing whether 
plans for the repairs can be changed to avoid making the newplant 
standards apply 
negotiators for epa and wisconsin electric might be able to come 
up with a solution that would reduce air pollution while holding 
down costs ms fox declined to discuss specifics of the talks but 
she confirmed that switching from coal to oil or gas is an option 
david hawkins an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council an environmental group said any agreement that did not 
adhere to the air standards exactly might be vulnerable to legal 
challenge 
though utility sulfur dioxide emissions have been falling since 
the mid1970s environmentalists say they would have been reduced 
by more if utilities had replaced plants faster rather than 
extending their usage 
life extension wasnt even on the radar screen in 1979 when 
the current regulations were promulgated said hawkins then the 
assistant epa administrator in charge of drafting them 
hawkins said epa is making the right call he added its 
about time they put some life and teeth into the requirements 
that some renovation qualifies a plant as new
