truckloads of soldiers roared through tiananmen 
square on sunday in a show of force to head off any demonstrations 
marking last years june 34 army attack on student prodemocracy 
protesters 
despite heavy security at the square and elsewhere in beijing a 
man tried to unfurl a protest poster near tiananmen but police 
immediately dragged him off witnesses said 
in a park in western beijing police broke up a crowd of about 40 
chinese at the english corner a place where people studying english 
gather each sunday morning to practice the police took five people 
away for questioning 
authorities ordered the corner closed down in october but english 
aficionados have continued to gather weekly with only token efforts 
by police to shoo them away 
meanwhile the us and italian embassies sunday denied italian 
news reports that chinas leading dissident astrophysicist fang 
lizhi and his wife li shuxiasn would be allowed to leave their 
shelter in the us embassy and travel to italy 
any rumor concerning fang theres nothing to them said us 
embassy press officer sheridan w bell theres nothing going on 
the couple sought refuge in the us embassy last june shortly 
after the military suppression of the prodemocracy movement and 
are wanted by chinese police on charges of counterrevolutionary 
activities 
on saturday sources in shanghai said wang ruowang a leading 
71yearold writer who participated in last years protests was 
arrested in september he has not been seen in public since last 
summer 
in beijing one student was seen saturday wearing a tshirt 
emblazoned with the prodemocracy movements vforvictory symbol 
but there were no other signs outwardly marking the anniversary that 
day 
the chinese are very practical theyre not going to do 
anything that clearly will fail said a student at beijing normal 
university which was one of the protest centers 
security guards patrolled beijing campuses and armed sentries 
were posted at a major intersection next to the main foreign 
residential compound in beijing on saturday 
the government warned foreign radio stations against broadcasting 
a taped program made by exiled chinese dissidents the dissidents 
had planned to broadcast from a ship off chinas coast but they 
abandoned the project when taiwan refused to allow the ship to load 
its transmitter and japan wouldnt allow the boat into japanese 
ports 
the protester sunday approached canadian broadcasting corp 
journalists as they stood beneath tiananmen gate just north of the 
square where the protesters had their headquarters last year the 
man wore ordinary workers clothes and appeared to be in his 50s 
the journalists said 
he unrolled a yellow poster for the journalists to see but they 
were able to read only the opening words to all foreign 
journalists we have invented a new philosophy when police 
grabbed him and the poster the reporters said 
rise up the man shouted to bystanders as police hauled him 
into one of their many posts on the edge of the vast square 
twelve trucks of soldiers each holding about 40 drove through 
the square in the early morning in a show of force 
more than 100 soldiers practiced drills with riot sticks 
truncheons and shields in front of the history museum on one side of 
the square where soldiers have been quartered since may 1989 
the square where last years protesters had their headquarters 
was was closed to the public but dozens of official buses vans and 
cars were parked on it 
security around the square was unusually tight with dozens of 
police vehicles parked on the edges and paramilitary police 
patrolling in pairs a shiny new water cannon was parked on one side 
on saturday authorities turned the square into a carnival ground 
for selected grammar school children 
elsewhere in the city convoys of police vehicles with lights 
flashing drove through the city early sunday 
tiananmen still bears the scars of tank treads from the night of 
june 34 1989 when soldiers retook it from protesters demanding 
democratic reform hundreds and possibly thousands of people were 
killed by soldiers as they marched into the city on their way to the 
square 
some underground activists said they wanted to make a 
commemorative gesture on the square sunday or monday but that it 
would be too dangerous 
on at least one beijing campus teachers were assigned to make 
bed checks in student dormitories at beijing university and other 
schools official dance parties were scheduled through the weekend 
to distract students 
on sunday authorities planned a ceremony in the square to 
commemorate the 1840 opium war against britain which official 
histories describe as an example of foreign imperialist aggression 
against china the war was triggered by british trade in opium 
bought in india and sold in china where it became a major social 
problem 
on monday 2000 taxis were to gather in the square to practice 
safe driving 
police have reported steppedup arrests of vagrants and common 
criminals in beijing and shanghai in the past week apparently part 
of the effort to keep order during the weekend 
the only three political activists who have continued to openly 
criticize the government dropped out of sight thursday and were 
believed in police custody they had planned to release an open 
letter to the government calling for the release of last years 
protesters hundreds remain jailed 
the sources in shanghai said wang a prominent writer who 
marched along with student protesters in that city last spring was 
taken into police custody sept 8 after having been held under house 
arrest for two months 
wangs family has not been allowed to communicate with him and 
he has not been formally charged the sources said on condition of 
anonymity police said he was being investigated for alleged acts of 
counterrevolutionary incitement

negotiations overseen by a 
government mediator failed saturday to end a weekold strike by 
independent truckers in british columbia who have blocked us 
border points 
meanwhile worried shoppers stockpiled food because they feared 
the strike which began last sunday will soon leave supermarket 
shelves bare 
some grocery shelves were emptied by panic buying 
provincial solicitor general russ fraser on friday appointed 
brian williams to mediate the bitter rate dispute between the 
truckers and the hauling industry 
williams met for six hours saturday with trucking companies the 
western owner operators association representing the independents 
and the teamsters union which speaks for union drivers 
the talks failed to produce an agreement but were scheduled to 
resume sunday williams said 
fraser vowed on friday that the border blockades would come down 
but they remained in place saturday snarling traffic customs 
officials at border points said police were monitoring the situation 
but not interfering with the blockade 
the striking independent truckers have blockaded the 
uscanadian border in british columbia with their rigs persuading 
or forcing american truckers to turn their vehicles around or park 
them 
this is a major inconvenience to the public fraser said 
buses and cars were getting through and so were trucks carrying 
medical supplies and mail but everything else was being turned back 
some store owners said worried customers bought more food than 
usual because of the strike 
some people are stockpiling said ken fowler the manager of 
thrifty foods fairfield store in victoria business is up 10 per 
cent 
some items including bananas and other imported produce 
disappeared fast he said 
the big crunch will hit us next week fowler said adding 
that 90 per cent of deliveries werent getting through to his store 
he said his chain is looking for an alternative delivery system 
sixty overwaitea and saveonfoods stores were running low on 
stock last week but spokesman peter walton said other delivery 
arrangements were being made 
cargo is also piling up at vancouverarea docks 
the impact is just starting said wayne stoilen 
vicepresident of canadian stevedoring co we believe it will 
build up quite fast 
the 3000 independent truckers in british columbia are hired by 
trucking companies that also run their own vehicles with union 
drivers 
the independents who pay their own running costs and maintain 
their vehicles are paid between 22 and 30 an hour they say 
theyll stay parked until their demand for 34 an hour is met 
the independents are responsible for moving 25 per cent of the 
truck freight in british columbia but have also won support from 
unionized drivers since last sunday they have blockaded all border 
crossings the transcanada highway at yale near hope and highway 
97 near penticton 
in an unusual twist residents of point roberts wash might 
soon have to head to canada to buy gasoline and milk at least one 
gasoline station in point roberts closed saturday because it was out 
of gasoline operators of several others said they were close to 
running out 
point roberts is reachable by land only through british columbia 
and all deliveries of goods must travel through the province to 
reach the small community

gasoline saturday and only one store had any milk left normally

south korean president roh taewoo left 
for san francisco sunday saying that his talks with soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev would open a new era in relations between the two 
once hostile nations 
roh is scheduled to meet gorbachev in san francisco on monday 
after the soviet president ends his summit talks with president 
bush roh plans to leave for washington on tuesday to talk with bush 
in san francisco mayor art agnos declared sunday roh taewoo 
day in honor of the south korean president agnos planned to 
present roh with the key to the city upon his arrival at san 
francisco international airport sunday morning 
the rohgorbachev meeting would be the first formal talks between 
the countries leaders since the republic of korea was formed 45 
years ago the soviet union is an ally of south koreas arch foe 
communist north korea our summit meeting will be an unusual one 
since our two countries have no diplomatic relations roh said 
during a brief departure ceremony at seoul airport 
accordingly this is expected to open a new era in our 
relations with the union of soviet socialist republics he said 
during his talks with gorbachev roh said he would focus on 
bilateral issues emphasizing the normalization of relations and 
measures to promote peace and unification of the divided korean 
peninsula 
i intend to exchange with president gorbachev extensive views 
on how to spread to northeast asia especially to the korean 
peninsula the waves of openness and cooperation now sweeping the 
world he said 
north korean officials have denounced the planned rohgorbachev 
meeting north korean president kim ilsung has refused to recognize 
the seoul government 
south korean officials said the unprecedented talks could lead to 
an early normalization of relations between seoul and moscow and 
accelerate trade and economic cooperation between the two countries 
the soviet union which supported north korea in the 195053 
korean war has greatly expanded economic and other unofficial 
contacts with south korea in recent years especially after the 1988 
summer olympics in seoul 
their bilateral trade increased 10 times from 1985 to total 600 
million last year and is expected to top 1 billion this year they 
exchanged trade offices and opened limited consular relations last 
year 
observers here believe that the rohgorbachev talks reflect 
seouls wish for normalized relations with the soviet union and 
moscows desire to induce more south korean investment to help ease 
its economic problems 
the talks represent a success for south koreas policy of seeking 
improved ties with communist nations which can exert influence on 
north korea and help reduce tension on the korean peninsula 
the korean peninsula was divided into the communist north and 
capitalist south in 1945 the two koreas have held talks on and off 
since the early 1970s but little progress has been made 
since 1988 south korea has opened relations with all eastern 
european nations except east germany and albania south korean 
officials said they are negotiating to establish ties with east 
germany 
seoul officials believe that improved ties with the soviet union 
would also stimulate china a close ally of north korea to 
establish diplomatic relations with south korea

i set high store by the personal relationship that the 
president and i have established the personal rapport between 
us he said 
bush standing at gorbachevs side before the two boarded a 
helicopter for the short ride back to washington said his view of 
the talks and his guests were in close parallel 
some will argue that we havent solved all the problems he 
said to me thats not the point the point is we have an awful 
lot of common ground

german unification and would talk more about it at their joint news 
conference sunday prior to his departure for minneapolis and san

weekends at camp david

gone well in his camp david discussions with gorbachev it was a 
good day yeah the president replied 
the soviet leader concerned about the military strength of a 
united germany has opposed bushs demand that the new nation be a

pressure on lithuania fitzwater linked moscows conduct with the 
granting of us trade benefits for the soviet union 
he said it will be difficult to win senate approval of a 
trade agreement announced by the leaders friday along with two 
agreements on slashing longrange nuclear weapons and stocks of 
deadly gas canisters because the united states feels very 
strongly about lithuania 
in addition fitzwater said this agreement is not going to the

as bush and gorbachev ended their talks the two sides issued a 
statement promising to work together to fight starvation in 
ethiopia they agreed to send food from the united states and have 
it delivered to ethiopia on soviet aircraft 
although the leaders did not dwell on the question of soviet 
pressure on lithuania fitzwater linked moscows conduct with the 
granting of us trade benefits for the soviet union 
he said it will be difficult to win senate approval of a 
trade agreement announced by the leaders friday along with two 
agreements on slashing longrange nuclear weapons and stocks of 
deadly gas canisters because the united states feels very 
strongly about lithuania 
in addition fitzwater said this agreement is not going to the 
congress until an emigration law is passed in the soviet union 
protecting free emigration

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warned 
israel on sunday he would consider suspending the issuance of exit 
permits for soviet jews if they continue to be settled on the west 
bank or in gaza 
president bush joined gorbachev at a news conference winding up 
their fourday summit with a reiteration of us opposition to 
further settlements on the lands captured from the arabs in the 1967 
mideast war 
i will try to persuade the government of israel that it is 
counterproductive bush said 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
some 20000 exit permits were issued last month about 70000 soviet 
jews are expected to enter the united states this year most of the 
others elect to go to israel where according to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir only about 1 percent settle on the west bank and in 
gaza 
if east jerusalem is included as occupied territory as bush 
insists it should be the percentage rises to about 10 percent 
gorbachev responding to a question said the soviet union is 
being bombarded by a lot of criticism from arab countries he said 
presidents hafez assad of syria and hosni mubarak of egypt had 
raised their objections in acute terms 
he said if israel did not heed appeals to keep jews from the 
territories we must give further thought to it in terms of what 
we can do with issuing permits for exit postpone issuing permits 
for exit 
the soviet leader did not make clear if the objections registered 
with him by arab governments applied only to jews going to the west 
bank and gaza or to their emigration to any part of israel 
the influx of soviet jews has been an unexpected boon to the 
jewish state as it seeks to maintain a sizable population in a 
largely hostile arab world 
on a related front bush defended the us decision to block a 
drive in the united nations for sending permanent observers to the 
area to monitor the situation under the supervision of the un 
security council 
he said the us preference was an inspection visit by a deputy 
of secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
bush sharply condemned last weeks guerrilla attack on israel 
it is unacceptable he said 
turning to the settlements issue though he said us policy 
is unchanged and clear we oppose new settlements in territories 
beyond the 1967 lines 
some 70000 jews have settled on the west bank and in gaza since 
the territories were surrendered by jordan and egypt 
us policy seeks a withdrawal by israel without specifying if 
all the land should be relinquished in exchange for recognition by 
the arabs 
egypt in 1979 signed a peace treaty with israel and reacquired 
all the land in sinai it had lost in the 1967 war

overcrowding in the nations jails worsened 
between 1988 and 1989 as construction of new cells failed to keep 
pace with a 15 percent jump in the number of prisoners the justice 
department said sunday 
the capacity of local jails expanded 8 percent between the middle 
of 1988 and midyear 1989 according to the study by the departments 
bureau of justice statistics 
on june 30 1989 there were 395553 prisoners held in jails 
operated by local governments designed to hold 367769 people the 
study said that marked a 15 percent increase from the 343569 
prisoners in custody on the same day in 1988 when the jails had a 
rated capacity of 339633 
the average daily population of the nations local jails for the 
12 months ending june 30 1989 was 386845 also up 15 percent from 
an average of 336017 for the same 12month period ending june 30 
1988 the study said 
the occupancy rate of the nations jails increased from 101 
percent to 108 percent between the two periods the study said in 
1983 the occupancy rate of nations jails was 85 percent and in 
1976 it was 65 percent 
overcrowding was worse in the jurisdictions that had the largest 
number of inmates the occupancy rate averaged 116 percent in the 
508 local jurisdictions that held at least 100 inmates these 
jurisdictions had 81 percent of the nations jail prisoners 
state prison overcrowding also contributed to the problem in 
local jails according to the study the study found that 88 percent 
of the 508 largest jurisdictions held 42053 prisoners for other 
authorities including 29358 inmates that had been sent to local 
jails because of overcrowding elsewhere the study said 
twentysix percent of these jurisdictions were under a court 
order to reduce overcrowding at one or more jails and 23 percent had 
been ordered by judges to improve conditions 
despite the increased overcrowding the number of inmate deaths 
declined from 469 during 1988 to 414 last year the study said the 
number of jail suicides declined from 147 to 121 
there were 19 million admissions and releases from local jails 
during the 12month period ending june 30 1989 
the average daily population of female jail inmates jumped 27 
percent between 1988 and 1989 women comprised 9 percent of all jail 
inmates in 1989 the study said 
the study surveyed local jails that hold inmates after 
arraignment usually more than 48 hours 
police lockups that house prisoners usually drunks for less 
than 48 hours were not included staterun jails and the combined 
jailprison systems of alaska connecticut delaware hawaii rhode

an hour before dawn a college dropout pastes 
notices onto alley walls and slips them through mail slots 
citizens who want china to be strong and prosperous destroy 
this national impasse and struggle for chinas future they say 
a red stamp proclaims the notices to be from the committee of the 
mainland alliance for democracy lie ma director lie ma is the 
collective pseudonym of the groups six members 
chinese people are gossips said the college dropout one of 
the six leave one notice and pretty soon the whole neighborhood 
knows if its an old woman who finds it even better you can 
always rely on her to talk 
he said the goal is simple we want to create an unstable 
situation in beijing 
one year after the army crushed the largest demonstrations under 
communist rule muffled but persistent voices of discontent continue 
to rise from underground defying stringent security measures 
the mainland alliance is one of several tiny groups formed to 
continue the democracy movement that was silenced above ground when 
soldiers fired on demonstrators in beijing last june 34 
some groups are known only from crudely mimeographed political 
manifestos distributed hand to hand or from typed leaflets left in 
public places 
one leaflet is signed simply a group of beijing citizens and 
students other underground activists have approached foreign 
journalists in beijing hoping to spread their message and discomfit 
the nations aging leaders 
a group in western china calls itself the chinese democratic 
front apparently in imitation of the chinese exile group based in 
paris which the chinese government made famous by criticizing it 
the domestic front says it has no contact with the paris group 
the democratic front for the salvation of china led by one of 
last years student protest leaders zhai weimin announced its 
formation in march 
zhais group is unusual because he remains in hiding fugitive 
no 6 on a government list of the 21 mostwanted student leaders 
most other underground activists lead normal open lives as 
students workers professors and even police officials 
the picture that emerges from talks with underground activists 
and other chinese sources is of separate groups each with six to 12 
members in at least half a dozen major cities 
these are not the first underground political groups to exist 
since the communist party gained power in 1949 but taken 
collectively they may be the largest such movement 
there is no nationwide network some groups are aware of the 
activities of others or have occasional contacts but they prefer to 
operate in isolation and rely only on trusted friends 
they are tightly knit inexperienced and fearful but they are 
learning the college dropout said 
when he arrived for an interview two friends were posted nearby 
to watch for plainclothes police he said the groups equipment 
includes invisible ink and a few mimeograph machines smuggled out of 
last springs protest headquarters on tiananmen square 
a public security official is the committees mainstay but not a 
member he has taught the six how to recognize plainclothes officers 
and police vehicles how to evade tails and what to do if questioned 
by security officials 
we are not against the government or the party the dropout 
said we think the communist party can reform we want to force it 
to reform 
he said the first objective is to force the party to reverse its 
verdict that last years protests were counterrevolutionary which 
would free the participants from lifelong political taint 
the democratic front for the salvation of china and the chinese 
democratic front want a multiparty system the latters political 
platform calls for a genuinely democratic political system that 
guarantees the whole people hold the highest political power 
including general elections and a free press 
a statement from the chinese democratic front also made up of 
about six people said our country has a tradition of fighting a 
feudal political system but the people also have a tradition of 
fighting feudal autocratic control 
our dream of democracy freedom equality justice and dignity 
is as strong as that of other races we do not love enslavement 
we have suffered enough

leftist activists of all stripes 
spurred by a bombing that injured two environmentalists are 
preparing for a widespread antilogging protest campaign theyre 
calling redwood summer 
earth first organizers said they hope to reproduce the 
environmental equivalent of freedom summer the 1964 voter 
registration campaign centered in mississippi that helped lead to 
the 1965 voting rights act 
though redwood summer protests are planned as peaceful civil 
disobedience to slow the pace of logging and save oldgrowth 
redwoods a number of violent incidents already have occurred 
because of tension between those who make their living from the 
northern california timber industry and environmentalists 
a letter writer identified only as the lords avenger has 
claimed responsibility for a pipe bomb explosion that injured earth 
first leaders judi bari and darryl cherney in oakland on may 24 
the writer also claimed responsibility for a pipe bomb that exploded 
outside a lumber mill may 9 
earlier bari and cherney reported receiving numerous death 
threats and last august her car was allegedly rammed by a logging 
truck 
during demonstrations a protester had her nose broken by a 
logger and another protester was dropped by a punch from another 
logger to that extent redwood summer resembles freedom summer 
which was marked by violence including the murder of three civil 
rights workers near philadelphia miss 
police arrested bari and cherney saying they knowingly carried 
the bomb when it blew up inside their car but so far no charges 
have been filed against them 
earth first founder dave foreman said in interviews that he 
believes the car bombing was an attempt to derail redwood summer 
dari and cherney were giving it all they had why would they 
risk losing it all he said 
redwood summer is the kind of event that could galvanize 
national and even international opinion to stop the destruction of 
oldgrowth temperate rain forests foreman said just like 
mississippi summer that finally turned public opinion around and 
brought about the passage of the civil rights act 
foreman is under federal indictment on charges of plotting last 
year to destroy transmission lines serving nuclear plants in 
california colorado and arizona 
the car bombing already has helped pull activists involved in 
other issues to the antilogging campaign 
amnesty international which investigates allegations of 
politically motivated violence against individuals worldwide has 
offered to look into the bombing incident 
weve had a multitude of groups step forward pam davis an 
earth first organizer told a cheering audience last month at an 
antilogging rally in santa rosa 
daniel barron an earth first member in san francisco said that 
the group is starting to form alliances with organizations in the 
peace labor and environmental movements that might have been 
enemies or lukewarm to us in the past 
offers include manpower money technical support and 
nonviolence training organizers said 
they said the recruits include greenpeace the christic 
institute which claims a secret government undertakes illegal 
operations such as the irancontra affair industrial workers of the 
world rainforest action network pledge of resistance which 
opposes us policy in central america and united student action 
which calls itself the nations largest progressive student group 
many of the activists span the political spectrum but say they 
have a common foe capitalist power and its abuses 
they are involved in a wide array of issues including support of 
organized labor the right to abortion increased aids funds and 
equal rights for women and minorities 
as for logging environmentalists say they are frustrated by 
official failure to restrain timber companies from cutting down more 
trees than theyve been growing 
timber officials deny that and government representatives say 
the industry has been properly regulated 
redwood summers kickoff protest is scheduled at the port of 
sacramento on thursday with a demonstration at a log exporting 
business

president roh taewoo meets soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev monday for historic talks on normalizing 
relations and easing hostilities on the divided korean peninsula 
the last outpost of the cold war 
roh traveled to san fransisco sunday for the meeting the first 
between leaders of the two countries which for most of the past 
four decades have viewed one another with hostility 
the talks are the culmination of seouls efforts to court 
reformist warsaw pact countries to broaden trade ties and influence 
sovietbacked north korea which is headed by kim il sung the 
longestruling communist dictator 
from all indications the meeting was arranged hastily with the 
blessing of the united states 
there was no firm agenda gorbachev was to be in san francisco 
sightseeing following his summit with president bush roh planned to 
fly to washington to see bush wednesday before returning to seoul 
the waves of reform now reshaping the world have started 
rushing toward northeast asia roh said as he departed he said he 
hoped talks with gorbachev would forge a new era in efforts to 
pave the way for the peace and unification of the korean peninsula 
korea now remains the only country on earth that is still 
divided as a legacy of the cold war roh said 
he is expected to invite gorbachev to visit seoul and may seek 
moscows help in arranging a summit meeting with kim 
roh will press for early and full diplomatic relations with the 
soviet union and ask for protection of seouls growing trade and 
economic exchanges with moscow 
the south korean president also is expected to propose a 
conference on easing tensions bringing together the koreas and the 
four powers with interests in northeast asia the united states 
the soviet union japan and china news reports said 
seoul and moscow both have an economic stake in increasing trade 
and in helping defuse tensions on the peninsula divided into the 
capitalist south and the communist north since 1945 
the two koreas fought a threeyear war in the early 1950s a 
peace treaty was never signed and the border between the nations is 
the most heavily fortified boundary in the world today 
the north has an estimated 11 million armed troops and south 
korea has 650000 last week the north renewed its 1988 proposal 
calling for both koreas to reduce forces to 100000 armed men in 
three to four years 
the united states which has 43000 troops stationed in south 
korea has declared strong support for improvement in southnorth 
relations and is trying to improve its own relations with the 
norths government in pyongyang 
north korea has denounced the rohgorbachev meeting and said that 
if it occurs it will be a serious political issue 
the criticism from north korea could have prompted moscow to 
treat the encounter casually as a meeting of leaders whose paths 
happen to cross in california the day before the meeting moscow 
still had not announced it 
for its part moscow may voice support of north koreas call for 
the signing of a peace treaty withdrawal of all nuclear weapons and 
the pullout of all us troops in south korea 
south korean news reports say moscow has requested from 3 
billion to 5 billion worth of loans and aid before increasing its 
trade and consular ties to full diplomatic relations the seoul 
government has not denied that aid is a possibility 
trade between the two countries was 600 million last year and is 
expected to top 1 billion in 1990 
south korean media have given enthusiastic coverage to the 
rohgorbachev meeting there are stories on everything from soviet 
trade food and handicrafts to new demand for russian language 
lessons 
seoul has established diplomatic relations with every east 
european country except albania and east germany

intense soviet television coverage of the 
washington summit put soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in the 
tricky position of addressing two audiences at the same time and 
trying to make sure each got the right message 
for four days gorbachev sought to persuade american political 
leaders hollywood celebrities intellectuals ordinary people 
and of course president bush that he has world as well as soviet 
security at heart in bargaining on arms cuts that hes being 
reasonable about lithuania and that the soviet union has legitimate 
reasons to have something to say about the military future of 
germany 
at the same time he was sending messages home to let his 
constituents know he was pushing hard for a trade deal to help the 
struggling soviet economy while hanging tough on lithuania and 
germany 
in the final minutes of his washington visit he was asked by a 
soviet reporter at a news conference televised live to the soviet 
union as well as the united states to comment on his political 
rivalry back home with boris yeltsin 
i dont think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our 
internal problems but cest la vie as they say gorbachev 
smilingly replied as the white house audience laughed 
he then used the opportunity to take a few political potshots 
saying yeltsin had recently changed his position on important issues 
and scolding him with the comment that this is not a political 
game 
everything will become clear pretty soon what comrade yeltsin 
is after gorbachev told his twonation audience 
from the moment he arrived last wednesday gorbachev showed his 
sensitivity to press coverage by calling soviet diplomats and 
journalists to the soviet embassy to ask how the american press was 
reporting soviet affairs 
the answer was mixed we said the american press generally was 
showing good will but of course there were various points of 
view said albert i vlasov chairman of the novosti press agency 
practically all his public appearances were beamed back to the 
soviet union where his popularity has been falling as economic 
conditions deteriorate and where his critics were seeking to take 
advantage of his absence 
the dual message was most apparent at a breakfast meeting friday 
with congressional leaders he talked at length about rising bread 
prices and other domestic economic problems a lecture shown in 
prime time on soviet television while ostensibly talking to 
american politicians gorbachev was actually seeking to reassure 
soviet workers 
more specifically he was defending himself against a rear guard 
attack by yeltsin the populist reformer who last week was elected 
president of the russian republic the heart of the soviet union 
in gorbachevs absence yeltsin opened talks with lithuanian 
independence leaders and called for the resignation of soviet prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov who last month introduced an unpopular 
plan to raise soviet food prices 
gorbachev said in his breakfast talk that the salary of ordinary 
workers would be cushioned against the price rises he also 
reiterated his position that lithuania was breaking the rules of 
the game by declaring immediate independence instead of following 
the soviet law on secession a point he reiterated vigorously at 
the sunday news conference 
on the lithuanian issue gorbachev walked a public relations 
tightrope during the summit trying to make his position appear 
conciliatory to americans while sending tough signals home 
he was aided by soviet spin doctors official commentators 
who sought to discredit the lithuanians in the eyes of the american 
press one of these yuri v golik chairman of the supreme soviet 
committee on law enforcement went so far as to tell reporters that 
lithuania has a high crime rate as a natural consequence of the 
political turbulence and adventurism under way there 
gorbachev also sent subtly conflicting messages to his two 
audiences on the question of germanys unification and possible 
membership in nato on one hand he seemed to want to reach 
accommodation with the west offering new ideas and assigning 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze to work on specifics with 
us secretary of state james a baker iii 
on the other hand he did not publicly back away from the 
soviets hard line against nato membership for a united germany and 
he made pointed references in his arrival statement at the white 
house and in the final news conference to the soviet unions heavy 
losses against nazi germany in world war ii 
for gorbachev the german question is the toughest of all 
international issues in terms of public opinion at home said 
fyodor burlatsky a former speechwriter for thensoviet premier 
nikita khrushchev and a prominent soviet commentator on 
international affairs 
even if the soviet union is unable to prevent german membership 
in nato he added gorbachev must show our people that he is doing

after years of international legal wrangling 
the us murder trial of a west german diplomats son accused of 
slashing his girlfriends wealthy parents to death has no more 
obstacles 
jens soering 23 is accused of killing derek and nancy haysom in 
march 1985 with help from their daughter because they opposed the 
romance he goes on trial this week before the local yokels he 
once bragged would never bring him back 
the haysoms were stabbed repeatedly and both victims throats 
were cut 
elizabeth haysom 26 is serving a 90year prison term after 
admitting she helped plan the slayings she did not fight 
extradition after the fugitive couple was arrested in london in 1986 
soering ultimately took his case against extradition to the 
european court of human rights which ruled last july that he should 
not be returned to the united states because he faced a possible 
death sentence 
virginia prosecutors won his extradition after promising british 
officials that capital murder charges would be reduced to 
firstdegree murder carrying a maximum penalty of two life 
sentences soering arrived in january 
jury selection was completed friday and trial was scheduled to 
begin this week 
time has caught up with all of us bedford county circuit 
judge william sweeney said 
soering is the son of klaus soering a diplomat previously 
serving as vice consul at the west german consulate in detroit the 
elder soering is now stationed in mauritania africa but was in 
court friday 
during the protracted extradition battle soerings attorneys 
sought to have him tried in his native country where there is no 
death penalty and he would have faced a maximum 10 to 15year 
prison term 
in a letter to ms haysom written about four months after their 
arrest soering scoffed at the early extradition efforts of virginia 
authorities 
those yokels dont know whats coming down he wrote in the 
letter made public during ms haysoms legal proceedings he 
predicted he would go to west germany and then ill be out in a 
surprisingly short time 
soering and ms haysom began their relationship while both were 
students at the university of virginia 
during school breaks ms haysom wrote to soering who was home 
in detroit about how she hated her parents and that they could be 
rich and happy together only if her parents were dead 
in recorded statements to investigators played during a pretrial 
hearing soering said he went to the haysoms home the night they 
were killed to confront them about their opposition to his 
relationship with their daughter 
on the tape he said there was an argument and the haysoms were 
dead when he left but declined to answer when asked if he stabbed 
them 
investigators concluded ms haysom was not in the house at the 
time 
haysom 72 was a retired steel industry executive he was 
stabbed 39 times mrs haysom 53 was stabbed five times 
their daughter testified at her sentencing hearing that she hated 
and resented her parents but was merely indulging in grotesque 
childish fantasies when plotting their deaths 
author ken englades recently released book beyond reason 
chronicles the haysoms story and was read by some courtroom 
spectators during lulls in the pretrial hearings 
englade said a television movie based on his book is under 
consideration and he plans to add a final chapter after soerings 
trial is completed 
these are people of intelligence and education involved in a 
very serious crime for no apparent reason englade said in a 
recent interview from his new mexico home these kids had such a 
bright future

here is a text of the joint news conference 
sunday by president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
president bush 
hello everybody please be seated well when president 
gorbachev and i were in malta we agreed that we would try to build 
a fundamentally different ussoviet relationship one that would 
move beyond containment to an era of enduring cooperation at the 
time no one knew the momentous events would unfold around the 
world and our task is if anything more urgent and the case for a 
new ussoviet relationship more compelling because the 
opportunities before us are so great 
weve not shied away from discussing issues about which we 
disagree there were some tough ones before us particularly the 
aspiration of the baltic peoples a cause which the united states 
fully supports i think its a mark of how far the ussoviet 
relationship has come that in all our exchanges whether about 
issues on which we agreed or disagreed the spirit of candor and 
openness a desire not just to understand but to build bridges has 
shown through 
president gorbachev and i had intensive discussions on the 
transforming events in europe events that have put before us our 
best chance in four decades to see europe whole and free i stressed 
that the longheld aspirations of the german people should be met 
without delay on the matter of germanys external alliances i 
believe as do chancellor kohl and the members of the alliance that 
the united germany should be a full member of nato president 
gorbachev frankly does not hold that view but we are in full 
agreement that the matter of alliance membership is in accordance 
with the helsinki final act a matter for the germans to decide 
over the last six months and in washington this week we made 
great progress in our mutual effort toward building a more peaceful 
and stable world we signed a very important chemical weapons 
accord nuclear testing protocols and gave a political push to 
others including negotiations to reduce ussoviet strategic 
nuclear forces and conventional military forces in europe 
im also hopeful that the good discussion between president 
gorbachev and the one we had about the importance of open skies will 
revive those negotiations we discussed regional issues and human 
rights in considerable detail made progress in the economic sphere 
concluding a commercial agreement a longterm grains agreement 
and in closing let me say how productive i really feel the last 
few days have been president gorbachev and i have agreed to meet on 
a regular basis perhaps annually both of us would like to think 
that we can get together more often with less formality because 
you see were now at a stage in the ussoviet relationship and 
indeed in world history where we should miss no opportunity to 
complete the extraordinary tasks before us mr president its been 
a pleasure having you here sir 
president gorbachev through interpreter 
ladies and gentlemen comrades what has happened over these days 
enables me to characterize this summit meeting as an event of 
enormous importance both for our bilateral relations and in the 
context of world politics president bush has listed the results of 
the work that weve done together here which enables you to see the 
scope the scale of this work and i think confirms the conclusion 
that i have drawn 
i agree with president bush fully who many times emphasized that 
we took malta as a point of departure and it is malta that added 
momentum to the process which of course must given all the 
difficulties and disagreements which we have and which we do not 
deny still leads us to a qualitatively new relationship with the 
ussr and the usa 
the atmosphere and the results of this meeting make it possible 
for us to speak really of a new phase of cooperation which the 
president has just mentioned i believe that this transition is both 
the result and a factor for further changes that affect all 
countries the constructive spirit of these days the spirit of 
responsibility in which we discussed all questions have made our 
success possible and thats really important because that has a 
stabilizing effect on the entire international situation at a time 
when we are addressing fundamental issues of civilization 
i would not want to now list give a listing of all that we 
discussed to mention all the agreements all the important 
questions and statements that we have made and that have a lot of 
potential for the future but let me still mention what is most 
important 
we signed the main provision for a treaty on the reduction of 
strategic arms and i would like to emphasize that this is the first 
time that were not just limiting but we will be reducing the most 
devastating means of warfare and i hope that we will sign the 
treaty itself this year we also signed a statement about the future 
treaty negotiations on nuclear and space arms we have agreed to 
make sure that we will complete the vienna talks this year and sign 
an agreement on conventional arms at a european summit by the end of 
this year not everything depends on us but this is our position 
we want to achieve that 
we also discussed problems relating to the european process 
specifically external aspects of german unification i cannot say 
that we have reached agreement but that does not mean that our 
efforts were futile many new arguments emerged as a result of these 
discussions and new possible perspectives we have clarified our 
positions and it is our position that we will continue discussion in 
order to find a mutually acceptable solution we could not resolve 
this issue in washington with the president the two of us there 
is also the twoplusfour formula and other european countries which 
are concerned and which want to see a mutually acceptable solution 
a solution acceptable to all of us 
the position of the soviet union is that we have to find 
solutions that would fit into the overall positive trend of changes 
in europe and in the world that would strengthen and not erode 
security i would like in particular to emphasize the importance 
of our dialogue at camp david where we talked during the day 
yesterday and this is a new phase in strengthening mutual 
understanding and trust between us

we really discussed all world problems we compared our political 
perspectives and we did that in an atmosphere of frankness 
constructive atmosphere an atmosphere of growing trust we 
discussed specifically such urgent international issues as the 
situation in the middle east afghanistan southern africa 
cambodia central america that is just some of what we have 
discussed i would not want to go into detail right now i think 
that you will probably seek to get clarification on this but anyway 
i think that the camp david dialogue was very important 
we have agreed to make a special statement on ethiopia to support 
efforts to reestablish peace there and also with the help of the 
united nations to give humanitarian relief to the ethiopian people 
speaking of bilateral relations we have some important political 
achievements here specifically there is movement on such important 
areas as trade agreement grain trade agreement on civil aviation 
cooperation maritime agreement peaceful uses of atomic energy 
science and technology and education 
while we and the president were working and our ministers were 
also discussing things there were important contact discussions 
with various american companies and some important decisions were 
made such as chevron that will be participating in the exploration 
of the tengiz oil fields that will mean an investment of about 10 
billion rubles 
a group of our academicians were here with me and they had a 
good discussion which resulted in the signing of a memorandum of 
intent with ibm which will participate in the program of using 
computers for education in the soviet union i think that this 
economic area and other areas create a good foundation for our 
political dialogue and creates a kind of solid support solid 
pillar of support for our cooperation i would like to express my 
profound gratification at this work that we have done together with 
president george bush i appreciate very much him as a political 
leader who is able in a very human way and in a politically 
responsible way to engage in dialogue and cooperation 
we spent many hours together and were able to come to know each 
other very well i dont know whether anyone will be ever able to 
say that we know each other totally well or completely i think that 
would take many many years but now we have a good human 
relationship and i think a good human atmosphere between us 
the president has said and i would like to confirm this that we 
have decided to have regular meetings on a working basis in a 
businesslike manner and this is really what is necessary i would 
like to tell you that ive invited president george bush the 
president of the united states to visit the soviet union to come 
for a state visit to our country 
in concluding and that is something that is not within the 
framework of the official negotiations but was part of our visit i 
would like to say both to the americans and to the soviet people 
that here we the soviet delegation we have felt very good feelings 
of the american people feelings of solidarity and a lot of interest 
from the americans toward what we are doing in the soviet union for 
perestroika i have felt that on many occasions in my short 
exchanges with the americans and also in various talks i would like 
to thank all americans for that and they certainly can expect 
reciprocity from the soviet union for that and finally we the two 
of us were discussing things of concern to us various regions 
various problems affecting the lives of other countries but that 
does not mean that we were trying to decide anything for others 
anyway we remembered always that what we were doing must be 
useful not only for our countries but for the world and of course 
specifically for that third world and let me at this wrap up my 
initial remarks at this press conference 
question id like to ask both presidents about germany 
president bush you mentioned that you still have a disagreement 
about the united germany being in nato in any concrete sense did 
you narrow your differences on this subject and are any 
alternatives being seriously considered 
president bush im not sure we narrowed them i feel i 
understand president gorbachevs position but i know this for a 
fact certain i had every opportunity to explain in considerable 
detail why i felt a united germany in nato would be stabilizing 
would be important for the stability of a postgerman unification 
europe so i cant say whether we narrowed them but the benefit of 
a meeting like this is once again you can talk in great frankness 
about it i have no suspicion about his position and i hope he has 
no suspicion about mine and weve got collective decisions to take 
with nato allies on matters of this nature and but in the final 
analysis its a question for germany to decide that and maybe 
were closer on that but i would defer to president gorbachev 
president gorbachev since i have already made quite a few 
remarks on many occasions during these days on this subject i will 
confine myself to comments which i think important in order to 
emphasize the thinking on this score and in order for us to 
understand better what theyre after were not insisting that it 
should be an option of the soviet union we are not saying that this 
should be a version by the united states of america or anybody 
elses option 
what we are talking about is an option or a solution of external 
problems related to germany unification which would organically 
incorporate the european process and improvement of international 
politics as a whole in order for so that a solution of these 
issues would help enrich this process and make it more stable and 
reliable were opposed to any options whatever it may come from 
we ourselves are not going to offer one one that would weaken 
these processes or create difficulties for the unfolding processes 
in the european continent were not going to put spokes in the 
wheels as it were 
so i believe the fact that the president myself and our 
colleagues have devoted a great deal of time to this issue we have 
threshed out this idea very very thoroughly i think it has been 
very helpful and beneficial because we will continue our debates on 
this

burma took a tentative step toward 
democracy in the impoverished nations first multiparty elections in 
30 years but despite an overwhelming opposition victory burmese 
are still cowed by military control 
the opposition scored a huge victory over conservative 
promilitary forces in the may 27 vote tallies show the parliament 
will be overwhelmingly dominated by the regimes harshest critics 
the national league for democracy 
the military has promised to yield power after newly elected 
legislators enact a constitution and form a civilian government but 
many express concern over whether the military will be able to wean 
itself from power 
in 1988 burmese took to the streets to press for democracy 
briefly triumphed then were brutally crushed by army gunfire today 
the 10 pmto4 am curfew is a nightly reminder the military 
still holds power 
and already the junta led by gen saw maung has said the army 
wont tolerate threats to national unity a vague phrase that in 
the past has been used to justify crushing dissent 
the tense political scene is complicated by economic malaise and 
ethnic insurgencies which could be interpreted as threatening 
national unity 
within the national league for democracy relatively 
inexperienced young radicals are vying for control with a more 
moderate senior faction another flash point could prove to be aung 
san suu kyi the dynamic opposition leader 
just as the philippines people power revolution united 
behind corazon aquino much of the leagues popularity comes from 
ms suu kyi who led burmese in the 1988 uprising 
the 44yearold former housewife and academic however was 
barred from participating in the may elections and remains under 
house arrest accused of subversion officials allege she has links 
to insurgent groups and they have indicated she wont be freed 
anytime soon 
the military barred other opposition leaders from participating 
in the vote and the opposition says hundreds of league members 
remain jailed from the 1988 uprising 
the league and its supporters dread a repeat of the rebellion 
when the army killed several thousand mostly unarmed civilians 
the prodemocracy movement began with small protests led by 
students who wanted an end to the oneparty rule of gen ne win he 
seized power in 1962 and since then the formerly prosperous nation 
has become one of the worlds poorest 
the protests culminated in massive nationwide demonstrations by 
civil servants professionals buddhist monks and some military 
personnel 
the protestors were already celebrating what they said was the 
triumph of peaceful revolution 
but the shortlived triumph turned to bloodshed when the military 
decided enough was enough several thousand people were gunned down 
by troops 
saw maung who took over after ne win retired in 1988 declared 
martial law and arrested thousands of protesters he also called for 
general elections and allowed new political parties albeit within 
strict controls 
this time around burmese expressed their opposition to military 
rule at the polls 
their overwhelming support for the new democracy league left no 
doubt about their desire for political and economic change 
im so happy to see those old cronies who devastated the 
economy leave the scene said a retired civil servant 
we have suffered a lot under the military said a younger 
man im happy that now we will have good leaders 
if the military allows it the leaders will come from the league 
composed of ms suu kyis more radical followers hungry for revenge 
as well as moderate older leaders who favor a cautious approach in 
dealing with the junta 
our first priority is to build a strong government so that 
people will be comfortable said one league official we want to 
sow the seeds for democracy so that our country will never again be 
ruled by arms

dianne feinstein and john van de kamp were on 
the attack sunday as time ran short in their heated battle for the 
democratic nomination for governor of california candidates in 
eight other states also were getting in their final licks before 
tuesdays primary elections 
the rival candidates put on closing television blitzes that were 
unrelentingly negative 
the tone was more subdued in other contests including a 
democratic senate runoff in north carolina gubernatorial primaries 
in alabama iowa and new mexico and a republican senate primary in 
montana 
mississippi new jersey and south dakota also were holding 
primaries but none of the statewide contests in those states 
appeared in doubt 
now you know why john van de kamp doesnt talk about his own 
record said a feinstein television ad that attacked the twoterm 
state attorney general on the death penalty abortion and his 
handling of the case of the hillside strangler who was accused of 
the rape and murder of 10 los angelesarea women a decade ago 
a van de kamp ad described feinstein the former mayor of san 
francisco as a republican in democratic clothing 
watching the democrats savage each other was sen pete wilson 
who has only token opposition in the republican gubernatorial 
primary wilson was sitting on a 35 million war chest after 
raising more that 11 million last year and in the first four months 
of this year 
van de kamp has raised about 61 million and feinstein 67 
million including 3 million of her own money 
the most recent polls said feinstein was marginally ahead of van 
de kamp but also had both democrats trailing wilson in a general 
election matchup 
harvey gantt and mike easley locked in a runoff for the north 
carolina democratic nomination to oppose republican sen jesse 
helms concentrated on firing up their supporters on the assumption 
turnout would be the key on tuesday 
gantt the black former mayor of charlotte finished first in a 
sixcandidate field may 8 but fell just short of the 40 percent 
needed to avoid a runoff 
two polls last week showed gantt leading easley among likely 
democratic voters 
a charlotte observer poll said gantt led easley 42 percent to 32 
percent with 27 percent undecided that poll of more than 400 
likely democratic voters had a margin of error of 49 percentage 
points 
a mason dixon poll conducted for several news organizations 
said gantt led 46 percent to 41 percent the survey of 424 likely 
democratic voters taken may 2830 showed 13 percent undecided and 
had a margin of error of about 5 percentage points 
in iowa where three democrats are vying for the nomination to 
challenge republican gov terry branstad house speaker don avenson 
was leader in a new poll published sunday in the des moines register 
the survey of 629 democrats said avenson was supported by 32 
percent while tom miller the state attorney general had the 
backing of 25 percent banker john chrystal had 19 percent 
avenson recently receiving the backing of the national abortion 
rights action league miller and branstad both oppose abortion 
four republicans and four democrats were competing in new 
mexicos gubernatorial primaries for the chance to run for the first 
term in which a governor will be allowed to run for reelection 
among the democrats was former gov bruce king who served two 
fouryear terms but was forced by the state constitution to step 
down after each one 
in montana four republicans were battling for the chance to 
challenge democratic sen max baucus 
in their final weekend of campaigning feinstein and van de kamp 
focused on the minority voters who may decide the democratic 
nomination 
feinstein appeared saturday before the annual state convention of 
the league of united latin american citizens to criticize van de 
kamps record on minority hiring in the state department of justice 
which he heads 
compared to a guideline of 25 percent hispanics van de kamp has 
only 115 percent in his total department and 15 percent in his top 
management feinstein said 
its time to open doors which have been shut i believe that is 
the symbolic the practical and the real value of my candidacy 
feinstein said im not talking about a quota im talking about 
what im going to do 
van de kamp disputed feinsteins figures on his department 
saying the statistics are skewed by the number of career staff 
members carried over from earlier administrations he said the proof 
of his commitment to minority advancement is the endorsements he has 
from groups such as the mexican american political alliance 
van de kamp also focused on the minority voters who today account 
for nearly half of californias registered democrats scheduling 
campaign visits to five black churches in the los angeles area 
sunday 
someday id like it to be said of me he tried to feed the 
hungry not only tried but succeeded van de kamp told the 
congregation of the praises of zion baptist church 
feinstein also blamed van de kamp for allowing the sale of up to 
10 million in nowworthless lincoln savings amp loan securities van 
de kamps spokeswoman barbara johnson said feinstein was 
demonstrating profound ignorance about the role of the attorney 
general in state government

an israeli human rights group said sunday the 
army was too hasty in opening fire on palestinians protesting an 
israelis massacre of seven arab workers last month 
the may 20 massacre by a deranged gunman and 16 subsequent deaths 
in clashes with the army helped produce the palestinian uprisings 
highest monthly death toll in a year said the israeli information 
center for human rights in the occupied territorities 
the center known in hebrew as betselem said the latest deaths 
came despite army claims that soldiers had learned to exercise 
restraint in countering protests in the 29monthold uprising 
the facts prove that the opposite was true said a report by 
the group founded by israeli liberals and intellectuals 
the centers initial inquiries give the impression that 
security forces did not show enough prudence to give residents 
sufficient opportunity to in any way express their pain and anger 
acting instead to nip all protests in the bud the report said 
a top aide to foreign minister moshe arens in response to a 
european community statement calling for restraint in the middle 
east blamed the violence on the plo 
this past week there were two sad reminders that the real 
obstacle to peace is plosponsored terrorism and refusal by arab 
states to put an end to a state of war and open peace talks with 
israel dany naveh was quoted on israel radio as saying 
the arens aide referred to a pipe bomb explosion that killed an 
elderly israeli and a foiled attack along the israeli coast by 
guerrillas from the palestine liberation front a plo faction headed 
by mohammed abbas 
the european statement saturday repeated a call for an 
international middle east peace conference to include the palestine 
liberation organization the statement said israels continued 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip is not sustainable 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs government refuses to hold talks 
with the plo which it considers a terrorist organization lhat seeks 
to destroy the jewish state he also has rejected the idea of an 
international peace conference 
including the seven men massacred may 20 in the tel aviv suburb 
of rishon letzion 33 palestinians were killed in may by israeli 
soldiers and civilians an equal number were killed in may 1989 when 
the palestinian uprising was more intense 
the israeli human rights center noted that two israelis were 
killed by palestinians in may apparently in revenge for the massacre 
or the subsequent killings by the army 
the highest monthly death toll in the uprising was 44 in april 
1988 when riots erupted to protest the assassination of plo 
military chief khalil alwazir in tunis tunisia alwazirs death 
was widely blamed on israel 
since the uprising began in december 1987 714 palestinians have 
been killed by israeli soldiers and civilians and 45 israelis have 
been slain by palestinians 
an additional 217 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs 
most after being accused of collaborating with israel israeli 
authorities say few had any such links

question i have this question to address to you mikhail 
sergeyevich you have just mentioned president bush as having 
qualities of a statesman could you tell us what role they played in 
helping you make so many accomplishments at this summit meeting and 
advance in the solution of many problems that seem to be intractable 
president gorbachev i can reiterate what i have said and i can 
add the following mr bush and i met each other a bit earlier 
before finding ourselves in this position together and during my 
contacts with him i felt and it was during my first visit here in 
1987 that this is the kind of person to do business with to build 
our relations with then we had contacts at the governors island 
which persuaded me even more of that we have maintained 
correspondence between us and perhaps malta was exactly the point 
where president bush and i could get to know each other even better 
and to engage in some thinking on oneonone meetings 
i must say that everything began with discovering the fact that 
president bush and myself have a desire to do business informally 
which is very very important if we added to this the fact that 
each of us while being himself and while representing their own 
people should react in a responsible fashion to everything and in 
context of the real role played by the soviet union and the united 
states of america we could very well imagine the human 
compatibility which exists between people and which enables them to 
create a kind of atmosphere that makes it possible to clarify the 
root causes of some particular processes 
i can say that this dialogue is well under way and as to 
yesterdays meetings at camp david they were a great accomplishment 
in and by themselves this is my assessment and i think the fact 
that we have established a rapport will be very important 
question this is a twopronged question for both presidents 
beyond words what guarantees can you give the palestinians that 
decisions you made on emigration will not result in the further 
usurpation of their lands and why is it that president gorbachev 
has shown so much human sympathy for the palestinians while the us 
vetoes even a un look at their plight under military siege 
president bush would you like to 
president gorbachev i please please 
president bush did you have a particular order you wanted us to 
answer that question in laughter 
question if you can 
president bush the united states policy on settlement in the 
occupied territories is unchanged and is clear and that is we 
oppose new settlements in territories beyond the 1967 lines it is a 
stated reaffirmed policy over and over again 
now we do not oppose the secretary general sending an emissary 
to the middle east to look at this important question the question 
is compounded however when you see on the eve of the discussion of 
that an outrageous guerrilla attack on israel launched from another 
country that is unacceptable to the united states having said 
that we dont want to the position of a our country is we do 
not think that it needs un troops or un security council 
missions but we do favor mr goulding a representative of the 
secretary general going there so when the question came and we 
differed with the soviet union indeed we differed with many of 
our other allies on this question it is our view that the most 
productive way to handle that question was to have an emissary from 
the secretary general not as the other countries in the security 
council favored a security council delegation go there 
question well mr president do you agree that there have been 
settlements even though this has been our policy for many years 
president bush yes i agree there are settlements that go 
contrary to the united states policy and i will continue to 
represent the policy reiterate the policy and try to persuade the 
government of israel that it is counterproductive to go forward with 
additional settlements in these territories our objective is to get 
the parties to the peace table and our secretary of state has 
worked diligently with the israelis and i have tried to do my best 
to get them talking and thats what we is the most the most 
immediate step that is needed and i will continue to reiterate 
american policy and continue to push for peace talks 
president gorbachev just a moment id like to respond too you 
formulated your question in precise terms namely what kind of 
guarantees can we issue so that those who want to leave those who 
have chosen israel as their place of residence those who leave from 
the soviet union should not be resettled in unoccupied 
territories this is not a simple question and this is what i have 
to say in this connection 
the soviet union is now being bombarded by a lot of criticism 
from arab countries lately i have had meetings with president 
assad of syria and president mubarak of egypt those were very 
important talks with them nevertheless this question this was 
the question that was also raised by them in acute terms the 
question of guarantees 
now we are facing the following situation either after these 
meetings and exchanges with the president of the united states of 
america on this particular issue our concern will be heeded in 
israel and they will make certain conclusions or else we must give 
further thought to it in terms of what we can do with issuing 
permits for exit and some people are raising the matter in these 
terms in the soviet union namely as long as there are no 
assurances from the israelis that this is not going to be done by 
them to postpone issuing permits for exit to put it off but i 
hope they will heed what the two presidents strongly advise them 
that they should act in a wise fashion perhaps this is what i would 
like to express by way of reacting

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
sunday that he would visit japan as part of an effort to build ties 
with his countrys pacific neighbors 
gorbachevs disclosure at a summitending news conference with 
president bush came on the eve of his planned meeting in san 
francisco with president roh taewoo of south korea which is 
actively seeking to normalize relations 
the soviet union wants to upgrade its outdated and inefficient 
production facilities and both japan and south korea could be 
valuable sources of inexpensive technology and consumer goods that 
arent available in the soviet union or are in such short supply 
that they are practically unobtainable 
the japanese had been expecting a gorbachev visit perhaps in the 
spring of 1991 but relations between the two countries have been 
strained by a longstanding territorial dispute 
the kuril islands which lie to the north of presentday japan 
were seized and settled by the soviets at the end of world war ii 
and the japanese want them returned the dispute thus far has 
blocked improved trade relations between the two countries 
meanwhile the south koreans have launched a major drive to open 
relations with former communist east bloc countries and are seeking 
new markets for their hightechnology exports 
but soviet officials have sought to play down the meeting between 
gorbachev and roh pointing to the sensitivity of relations with 
north korea the soviets longtime ally 
some members of the soviet delegation also have suggested that 
japanese business leaders are uneasy about the gorbachevroh meeting 
because they view the south koreans as competition for the soviets 
huge market and natural resources 
gorbachev in his remarks at the news conference said the soviet 
union would like to help build a cooperative community among pacific 
nations like the one in europe 
we must act with due regard for those specifics in the asian 
region he said without copying blind the european process but 
borrowing something from it 
of course i think this road will be longer and more thorny 
gorbachev said but still it is especially necessary over there 
because those peoples need an opportunity to reallocate their 
resources to overcome a lot of social problems that have been 
accumulated 
he noted the increasing contacts between the soviet union and 
india and china countries he has visited within the last two years 
i am planning to go on a visit to japan so as to open that area 
for discussion he said so were going to intensify our efforts 
in that direction

andre agassi found himself down two sets to 
one on the fashion court as mr blackwell joined french tennis 
officials in volleying against the athletes penchant for flashy 
attire 
like an outdated flower child the mildmannered but 
acidtongued fashion critic clucked saturday as he described 
agassis appearance 
the tennis star had lashed out at the french tennis federation 
and its president philippe chartrier the day before for indicating 
that an oncourt dress code may be implemented if the players dont 
cool it with the outlandish outfits 
those bozos will look for anyone to talk about said agassi 
who has a preference for bright pink tennis tights and a haircut 
that is a cross between punk rock and heavy metal 
chartrier made his pronouncement as agassi was defeating arnaud 
boetsch to advance in the french open in paris 
he has every right to wear what he wants to wear provided he 
has some respect for the sport hes in blackwell told the 
associated press let him wear his neon flowerchildgonetoseed 
shorts but i would suggest he get himself in front of a mirror 
before he goes out in public 
while blackwell sympathizes with the gatekeepers of tennis 
fashion however he believes establishing an oncourt dress code is 
going too far he said it should be up to the players to show good 
taste in fashion 
weve lost the quality of knowing what to wear opined 
blackwell whose annual compilation of a 10worstdressedwomen list 
has been a fashion world event for years 
thats whats wrong with a lot of our society he added 
you dont wear jeans to the opera you simply do not do it its a 
reflection of us and our selfesteem

mikhail s gorbachev played horseshoes and 
hardball during his four days in washington 
he took off his tie and relaxed at camp david disarmed critics 
with a candid assessment of his problems at home and sealed deals 
with american corporate giants chevron and ibm 
he delighted throngs of summit watchers with his patented 
impromptu walks along downtown streets basking in adulation and 
saying i feel at home here 
he declared the cold war over but said time and again that moscow 
wont let the west dictate the terms of an emerging new political 
and military order in europe 
perhaps alluding to the main prize he won from president bush a 
trade agreement gorbachev described his summit partner as a man 
i can do business with 
the soviet leader is under enormous pressure at home to rebuild a 
collapsing economy and he used his washington visit not only to 
plead for patience but also to draw american technological knowhow 
into his economic reform efforts 
while gorbachev was pitching horseshoes at the presidential 
retreat at camp david md on saturday the soviet embassy hosted a 
signing ceremony for an oil exploration deal with chevron and an 
agreement for ibm to put personal computers in soviet schools 
the deals are examples of the kind of commercial contacts that 
could prosper under the trade agreement that bush and gorbachev 
signed on friday the soviet leader touted the chevron and ibm 
agreements at a summitending news conference sunday as a good 
economic foundation for improved superpower relations 
he candidly acknowledged that his efforts to introduce a 
marketoriented economic system had not yet succeeded saying that 
while the united states can draw on a tradition of free markets the 
soviet union must start from scratch 
but he was quick to add that no one should think he came to 
washington with my hat in hand nor should the west try to take 
advantage of moscow at a time of internal turmoil 
throughout a hectic schedule that began with his arrival last 
wednesday evening and included meetings with american entertainment 
academic and political figures gorbachev appeared relaxed 
selfassured and in good spirits 
he was at ease enough to deflect a soviet reporters pointed 
question about his relationship with political nemesis boris 
yeltsin who won election to the presidency of russia last tuesday 
and immediately called for sovereignty for the largest soviet 
republic cest la vie a grinning gorbachev responded 
he reached out to americans literally and figuratively he 
pressed the flesh with ordinary citizens on washingtons crowded 
streets and at a formal treaty signing ceremony in the white house 
he asked to be excused for the length of his remarks saying in a 
tone of mock exasperation im human im emotional 
gorbachev got the trade agreement he wanted albeit with 
conditions attached but he fell short of convincing bush of the 
soviet view on perhaps the two most sensitive issues raised during 
the summit the future military alignment of a reunited germany and 
his handling of lithuanias demand for independence 
with a flash of iron will and resentment of what he considers 
preaching by the west gorbachev did verbal battle with a group of 
congressional leaders in a meeting friday at the soviet embassy 
when sen bob dole the minority leader from kansas complained 
about moscows partial economic blockade against lithuania 
gorbachev shot back with a gibe on the american invasion of panama 
when we hear there is a debate in congress about our affairs 
about what we should do well this is resented in our 
society gorbachev said this is a matter of dignity

question my question is addressed to comrade gorbachev your 
relationship with president bush perestroika activities are well 
assured inside but there is a cooling of interest everybodys 
concerned with internal matters at home taking advantage of this 
opportunity id like to ask you what do you think of your 
relationship with yeltsin are you going to offer a branch an olive 
branch of peace to each other 
president gorbachev i dont think you have chosen the best place 
for clarifying our internal problems but cest la vie as they 
say there is real life there are certain processes under way back 
home and i thought i tried to respond to this question when i was in 
canada as soon as i stepped out of the plane they asked me this 
particular question and i said that what i was worrying about most 
was a kind of an impasse which emerged at the congress itself 
because there is no strong preponderance it took really three 
rounds for comrade yeltsin to gain a majority of votes by just a 
few votes to be elected so the situation remains 
and i said that in recent days something has happened which 
calls for thinking on our part comrade yeltsin with respect to 
some very serious important political fundamental issues has 
changed his position at least he has introduced clarity and i 
said if this is not a political game for him to hold high office 
it is one thing a certain approach can be adopted on the basis of 
that and we could certainly forecast certain kind of developments in 
the soviet in the supreme soviet and in russia 
but if this is nothing but a maneuver and he will return to what 
he has been doing in recent years not only critical terms 
americans believe this is to be constructive but also in 
destructive activities destructive efforts he went as far as to 
fertilize in the framework of perestroika our efforts with some 
ideas with ideas regarding forms of life where we are making a 
turnaround in all spheres so if he is going to come back to this 
then of course his chairmanship will certainly complicate these 
processes 
i should say that after that he gave an interview and people 
began to see that he is changing again the very next day he was 
interrogated at a session he tried to explain his position in 
short i always say life will place everything in proper 
perspective now that we have reached a phase of radical fundamental 
change where everybody is supposed to show great responsibility for 
their country where we are changing everything now that we have 
we are about to make a radical change about in our economy it is 
all very serious everything will become clear pretty soon what 
comrade yeltsin is after 
question president bush id like to ask you about the trade 
agreement that you signed yesterday already a matter of some 
political controversy and criticism in this country secretary baker 
has indicated it will not go to congress for its action until the 
soviet codification of its new emigration policies does that mean 
sir that when that law is passed in the soviet union that you are 
prepared to go ahead as well with most favored nation trading status 
for the soviet union or will that further step require some action 
some loosening some shift on the baltics 
president bush well we had a chance to discuss the baltics and 
i made clear that the baltics i think i said it at a us press 
conference several weeks ago caused some tensions that the 
linkage is between the trade agreement and the emigration 
legislation and im not going to send that legislation up and ive 
tried to be very frank until the soviet union has completed action 
on the legislation guaranteeing the right of emigration 
question what about the further step of actually granting most 
favored nation status 
president bush well ive given our position and the linkage is 
between the emigration and thats it 
question can we take it then sir that most favored nation 
status would then be forthcoming if this emigration law is codified 
president bush well well cross that bridge when we get to it 
but the linkage is between the emigration and the i mean the trade 
agreement linkage is between the mfn is hooked into the emigration 
law being passed thats it we have other trade agreements we have 
other agreements the grain agreement and we have a maritime 
agreement and the concern over the difference in position we have 
on the baltics you might say affects is one of the thorns in the 
side of an overall relationship weve always had a difference on 
this we have not recognized the incorporation of the baltic states 
into the soviet union thats been the historic position of the 
united states but that concern you might say affects a wide array 
of issues that we have with the soviet union 
frankly ive been very pleased first place ive tried to be 
very frank with president gorbachev not just here but before he 
came here saying the difficulties that i faced and jim baker was 
very frank with eduard shevardnadze saying the problems we face i 
think it is important in this emerging relationship that we share as 
directly as we can with the soviet side the political problems we 
face 
theyve weve got a congress that has its rights they have 
every right to look at what ive signed and every obligation to do 
that and make their judgment as to whether its in the best 
interests i signed the trade agreement because i am convinced that 
it is in the best interest to the united states i believe the same 
thing about the grain agreement i believe the same thing about the 
maritime agreement but i dont want to mislead the american people 
and say that i have lessened my concern over the baltic states ive 
tried to be frank with our the soviet side on this but the linkage 
back to your question with mfn with trade is on emigration 
law being passed and then we go forward

major newspapers predicted 
sunday that the 4yearold national state of emergency will be 
lifted next weekend almost everywhere but in natal province which 
has been plagued by factional fighting 
the papers said the announcement will be timed to coincide with a 
13nation tour by african national congress leader nelson mandela 
who will visit europe africa the united states and canada starting 
monday 
revocation of the state of emergency has been a key demand of the 
anc before it agrees to formal negotiations with de klerk on a 
constitution that would set up blackwhite power sharing 
the anc has said foreign governments should not lift economic 
sanctions against south africa until the emergency laws are lifted 
and mandela is expected to ask that sanctions remain for now 
the state of emergency was imposed on june 12 1986 by former 
president pw botha to quell nationwide antigovernment protests 
and political violence that killed more than 2000 people most of 
them black 
but since he came to power last august president fw de klerk 
has nullified some provisions of the emergency decrees and says he 
intends to dismantle apartheid 
he has permitted antigovernment protests legalized the anc and 
other banned groups freed scores of people detained without charge 
and lifted most restrictions on news coverage 
during a trip to europe earlier this month de klerk said he 
would review the remaining emergency provisions when they come up 
for renewal on june 11 
they restrict reporting about unrest some forms of protest and a 
broad range of statements the government considers subversive 
on sunday four national newspapers representing a range of 
political viewpoints said the state of emergency would be almost 
completely lifted 
most state of emergency measures will be scrapped within the 
next few days wrote the antigovernment english language sunday 
star 
the middleoftheroad sunday tribune said parts of the 
emergency are likely to remain in force however particularly in 
troubled areas such as natal 
the afrikaanslanguage and generally progovernment rapport and 
city press the largest circulation newspaper for blacks carried 
the same news 
the timing of the announcement on the emergency will complicate 
mr mandelas position overseas the sunday tribune said 
mandelas will include stops in britain france germany 
ireland italy botswana ethiopia uganda kenya and mozambique 
since de klerk legalized black political groups and freed mandela 
and other prisoners there has been a surge in violence 
supporters of rival black groups have battled one another in 
townships nationwide leaving more than 500 people dead this year 
there has also been an increase in shootings by police who have 
fired on marchers or defended themselves from attacks by crowds in 
townships 
most of the violence has occurred in natal where the emergency 
laws have not stopped supporters of the anc and the inkatha 
organization from fighting each other in recent years more than 
5000 people have died in the province 
mandela has asked the government to use soldiers and police to 
stop the factional fighting and some observers said he agreed 
troops should be left in natal while emergency restrictions were 
lifted elsewhere

a contest to determine the nations 
favorite bureaucrat found the winning dogooder not in a haven 
of officialdom like washington dc but in rural tennessee 
it wasnt an easy search 
matthew lesko a bestselling writer and governmental information 
access expert spent a year promoting a contest called my favorite 
bureaucrat 
i personally thought it was one of the neatest ideas ive ever 
had said lesko who operates a publishing organization in chevy 
chase md 
the idea was to get nominations from ordinary folks who had been 
helped in some special way by a public servant the best nominating 
letter would win 5000 and the bureaucrat would get a trophy 
but after six months he had received only one nomination and 
that was from another bureaucrat nominating her boss 
leskos predicament however brought true publicity to the 
contest bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation after 
all wrote the wall street journal 
leskos information usa inc then was flooded with nominations 
more than 1100 entries poured into the office staff members said 
i was just so excited lesko said 
he heard about a bureaucrat who helped a woman with cancer get 
medical attention one who helped find a father missing for 20 
years another who gave 5000 in free tax advice and one who gave 
free legal help to press a grandmothers sexual harassment charge 
and then he read the letter from small businessman charles 
frosty kimbrough of morristown tenn this was it lesko thought 
i have been in business on my own for seven years wrote 
kimbrough ive had a lot of ups and downs and at times ready to 
give it up 
then last year kimbrough wrote he met richard mckinney a 
consultant at the small business development center at walters state 
community college the center is partially funded by the federal 
small business administration 
with mckinneys help its been a great year my income doubled 
and im more confident about the future of my business kimbrough 
wrote 
kimbroughs company makes picnic tables and cooking grills his 
workforce is himself his wife and sometimes another worker or two 
mckinney helped kimbrough get on a bidding list with the state 
parks system figure his costs get credit extensions with his 
suppliers and locate materials and showed his wife how to do the 
books 
all i had was just a big question mark you know kimbrough 
said in a recent interview ive never been able to pay anybody to 
help me like he has 
and when kimbrough was hurt just as he tried to meet his first 
big state contract deadline mckinney helped paint grills on his own 
time to get the order out 
he needed business and i helped bid the stuff i felt that in 
order for him to succeed and get other state orders he had to 
deliver on time mckinney said 
the extra personal effort that he did above and beyond the call 
of duty really struck me lesko said 
but mckinney said it wasnt out of the ordinary 
you cant give very good advice if you sit in an office and 
tell a guy how he ought to be doing his business he said if 
you do it right you have to do it because you want to help people 
leskos contest had two runnersup each getting a 500 prize 
victoria and rick coombs of mesa ariz were secondplace 
winners for nominating local employment specialist irvin gallegos 
who helped a homeless vietnam veteran and his wife find food 
shelter and a job 
the other runnerup winner was david muellenhoff a university of 
california berkley student who nominated carole zimmerman of the 
library of congress she told him how to preserve his prized comic 
book collection 
lesko has written about 40 books including bestsellers 
information usa and getting yours the compete guide to 
government money 
he said he plans to make the contest an annual event 
meanwhile mckinney has left the bureaucratic ranks 
i took my own advice and went into business he said

question in connection with this meeting there was a lot of 
speculation about weak and strong points somebody speaks from a 
position of strength someone from a position of weakness how would 
you define what a strong position is a position of strength what 
is the place where factoral force of strength holds what are the 
components of force what does politics what makes politics strong 
this is a question that is addressed to both presidents 
president gorbachev let me begin first in order to let president 
bush have a little rest i think this is certain speculation on this 
score both during the preceding period and in the course of our 
talks we have been acting representing our peoples and countries 
well aware of what the dialogue is all about and i think to assume 
that someone myself or president bush can dictate to each other 
or to the soviet union is absurd this would be the greatest 
misconception on the basis of which no progress could ever be made 
i think that this idea is suggested because at this point in 
time the soviet union is deep into profound change and since 
fundamental change is involved we are walking away from one 
particular way of life toward different forms of life we are 
changing our political system we are introducing a new model in 
economy all these are fundamental things indeed debates are under 
way doubts are being expressed views are being compared and this 
is very important because what is at stake is our destiny of 
course when you look from outside well we ourselves can feel the 
strain of our society it is very much politicized but a look from 
outside without knowing all the subtleties without knowing all the 
depth of sentiments one could certainly arrive at some erroneous 
conclusions 
hence the question of how long will gorbachev stay in his 
office and how this whole perestroika will end and so on and 
so forth even this i think fits into this process of profound 
change and perhaps this is something we cannot do without but the 
most important thing is that everything is that is happening 
confirms not only the fact that were cleaning up our courtyard 
were really revamping our entire society we are trying to adapt it 
to human needs on the basis of freedom and democracy we want to 
make it more open toward the outside world that is the essence and 
therein soviet people do not differ and i hope there are no 
differences on that among the journalistic corps 
perhaps some part of society thinks otherwise but the question 
is how to do all this to avoid losing everything that we should 
keep and get jettison everything that we dont need that stands in 
the way i dont think we have ever tackled a task like this in the 
history of our country i dont know whether anybody else has been 
able to resolve so many tasks within such a short period of time 
so it is for this particular reason that we appreciate so highly 
the fact that the whole world understands this greatly so from 
this particular perspective i wish to state and this goes to show 
the farsightedness of president bush and his colleagues to say 
nothing of the american public which overall understands what is 
happening in the soviet union today understands that this is 
something that we need above all 
of course its up to us to solve all these problems but of 
course everybody understands full well that this is something that 
the whole world all the nations need for without such changes 
without a stronger balanced harmonized world we will not 
accomplish our objectives so today the pivotal point of world 
politics is perestroika in the soviet union not because we are 
there but because this is an objective reality 
president bush may i simply add that the united states is not 
trying to deal from strength or weakness i tried to say this at the 
welcoming ceremony for president gorbachev we have a unique 
responsibility to deal with world peace it is no other countries 
have the same degree of responsibility that the soviet union and the 
united states have and so were not looking for winners or losers 
we salute reforms that make our systems more compatible on the 
economic side on the human rights side the openness side 
but were not looking for for trying to achieve advantage we 
sat down here one on one and tried to hammer out agreements and 
get closer together on vital matters affecting other countries and 
it is because of the standing of the soviet union and the standing 
of the united states in the world that we have responsibilities 
so i can tell you and all the journalists from soviet side 
european journalists the united states is dealing with mutual 
respect here we salute the changes of course but we have a unique 
responsibility in the world and i plan to one of the things im 
pleased about in our agreement is that we will be meeting more 
often now and we cant miss an opportunity to enhance stability and 
peace in the world and i so thats where im coming from on your 
question 
question following on president bushs comment on a scale that 
had adversaries at one end and allies at the other would you now 
say that each others country was more of an ally than an adversary 
president bush i think youre i think i dont want to get into 
semantics alliances have a connotation to some that they might 
not have for another adversaries sometimes convey the concept 
of hostility or enmity in my view weve moved a long long way 
from the depths of the cold war weve moved towards a i dont 
quite know how to quantify it for you but we could never have had 
the discussions at camp david yesterday or as we sat in the oval 
office a couple of days before with president gorbachev 20 years 
ago we all know that so theres been a dramatic move and the 
more this reform and openness takes place the more compatible the 
relationship becomes neither of us tried to cover over the 
differences so i know thats too general for you but thats where 
id leave it

soviet refuseniks reacted angrily to mikhail s 
gorbachevs warning sunday that he might reduce the number of jews 
allowed to emigrate if israel continues to settle them in the 
occupied territories 
gorbachev made the comments sunday at the close of his summit 
with president bush 
the statements from the soviet president about restriction of 
emigration from the ussr are not very good for any of us said 
mikhail shapiro who has been denied permission to emigrate since 
1988 
leonid stonov a spokesman for refuseniks jews who have been 
refused permission to leave the soviet union said it is a human 
right to be able to emigrate 
it is one question to allow someone to leave the country and 
quite another to decide where that person will be allowed to live 
said stonov he said the kremlin should not determine where 
emigrants go 
he said only a rather small number of soviet jews settle in the 
occupied territories he was referring to the israelioccupied 
gaza strip and west bank land israel captured from the arabs in the 
1967 middle east war 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
and 1 million soviets are seeking to leave 
about 150000 are expected to move to israel this year israeli 
officials say only about 200 new arrivals have settled in the 
occupied lands 
however gorbachevs liberalized emigration policy has not yet 
become law and president bush says the supreme soviet legislature 
must pass it before he implements a bilateral trade pact signed at 
the summit 
last november the legislature gave preliminary approval to a 
bill that would allow emigration for virtually anyone with entry 
permission from another country and no outstanding alimony 
obligations criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets 
the bill sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can 
be kept from emigrating because of access to secrets jewish 
activists however say the bill is vaguely worded and could be used 
to restrict immigration 
shapiro said he was fired from his job as a computer specialist 
at a small institute run by the soviet academy of science after 
applying to emigrate in 1988 he said he stopped working with 
classified material 12 years ago 
according to lists compiled by the refusenik community 140 
families have been refused permission to emigrate down sharply from 
a few years ago 
stonov said gorbachevs warning demonstrates that it is the 
good will of the authorities rather than legal changes that 
allows people to emigrate 
the controversy stems from pressure by arab governments on 
gorbachev following a recent statement by israel prime minister 
yitzhak shamir that his nation wanted more soviet jews to settle in 
the occupied territories

question to president bush if i may to follow up my 
colleagues one are there circumstances under which you would be 
prepared to recommend the total dissolution of nato whats the 
threat that still keeps it in business 
president gorbachev how long do you think the transition period 
should last before the responsibilities of the four powers run out 
the four victorious powers in world war ii 
president bush you want me to start with that one 
staff why dont you answer the first one why dont you answer 
the one 
president bush me and all right the threat as i looked at the 
world the threat is unpredictability and stability how do you or 
instability is the threat we feel that a continued us presence in 
europe should not be seen as hostile to the soviet interests but 
indeed we hope a continued us presence there will be seen as 
something thats stabilizing and nato is the existing machinery 
that we feel with an expanded mission can best provide that 
stability and herein we have a difference with the soviet union 
but it is that rather than some kind of cold war mentality that 
drives our decision to one remain in europe and two to try to 
have a broader role for nato under article 2 of the nato treaty 
there is language put in there im told by lester pearson years 
ago that provides a broader than just military assignment for nato 
so we see this as not exclusive to an expanded role for csce not 
contradictory to the aspirations of many europeans for an expanded 
eec but as a way in which we can continue without hostility to 
anyone to provide a stabilizing presence 
president gorbachev id like to respond to this extremely 
important question if i may first as an overall statement of the 
fact it seems to me that if some kind of option is suggested one 
that would replace or would be accompanied by replacing an isolation 
on the european continent either of the united states or of the 
soviet union then i would say in no uncertain terms and i could 
even make a forecast that that particular option would be doomed 
it would be doomed in the sense that it would be difficult to put 
into effect but what matters most it would lead to the 
exacerbation rather than improvement in the situation 
for that reason we believe that we will not be able to make any 
further progress in restructuring international relations including 
in the main european area without an active participation of the 
united states of america and the soviet union these are realities 
and theres also a great sense of responsibility behind those 
realities this is the first point 
the second point now yes indeed we believe that the option 
which we think will be found eventually and which will provide a 
powerful momentum and which would contribute to the strengthening of 
the european process must necessarily include some kind of a 
transition period during which we could join our efforts to conclude 
a final document exhausting thereby the rights we are endowed with 
as the victorious four powers under the results of the second world 
war these are the issues that were raised by history itself and so 
therefore in the framework of international law it must be brought 
to conclusion 
a concurrent unification of germany and its presence would mean 
the coincidence of these two events this would mean that this would 
be an independent and sovereign state i really dont know and i 
wouldnt like to engage in speculation about the timeliness but i 
think that we must be very very active now so that so as to ensure 
some kind of synchronization between the internal processes which 
lead to the unification of germany and the settlement of external 
aspects so that they would be combined 
i can see and i offered many options in our position those 
options are there and it seems to me there are some points there 
are some points the american side has noticed i am expressing my 
supposition i am not saying that i heard this from the president 
but i think they have something to think about and i think we will 
give serious thinking to the us position too 
question president gorbachev on the subject of nato membership 
for a united germany you have complained in the past about western 
sensitivity to your security concerns some of your aides say 
privately that germany a united germany could belong to nato and 
your security concerns could be satisfied both by a limited american 
presence in germany and primarily by strict limits on german troops 
and armaments the real problem they say is psychological a matter 
of national pride they say that if you accept germany in nato it 
will be a humiliating admission for the soviet people that youve 
lost the cold war in your talks with president bush were you frank 
about this is this a problem for you and president bush have you 
considered this problem yourself in your own thoughts 
president gorbachev first i do not think that whatever im 
saying on these extremely important questions of world politics 
appears to be a complaint from me or from the soviet union this 
would be humiliating for the soviet union to pass his hat around to 
come here to washington or to bonn or elsewhere this is out of 
the question and please bear that in mind this is the first point 
the second point is you know there is a process under way a 
beneficial process and look how far we have progressed in this 
process we are entitled to raise the question of these terms each 
subsequent step must strengthen it rather than weaken it we have a 
right to that 
take for example our negotiations and 50 percent reductions in 
strategic offensive arms if you were if this whole negotiating 
process were to be depicted to you in its entirety you would 
certainly see the kind of battles we are having on each and every 
point why because nobody really wants his security to be 
diminished

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev boasted sunday of their summit rapport and agreed they 
should get together more often 
gorbachev expressed his profound gratification at this work 
that we have done together 
bush retaining a bit of reserve said mr president its 
been a pleasure having you here sir 
but if they werent on a firstname basis it was clear that they 
had gotten along well together in four days of talks at the white 
house and camp david 
bush said the summit had been so productive that now he and 
gorbachev want to get together more often with less formality 
perhaps annually 
gorbachev said he realized the first time he met thenvice 
president bush in 1987 that this is the kind of person to do 
business with to build our relations with 
everything began with discovering the fact that president bush 
and myself have a desire to do business informally which is very 
very important said gorbachev who has a reputation as an 
allworkandnoplay politician 
he extolled the rapport he and bush developed in their tiesoff 
dialogue at camp david the presidents rustic mountaintop retreat 
in maryland 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater described the relationship 
between the two leaders this way 
the two guys are very much alike he said when they debate 
across a table they see a mirror image they even have a similar 
sense of humor they make fun of things they tease each other 
for bush who originally wanted to take gorbachev for an 
overnight stay at his oceanfront home in maine the trip to camp 
david was a triumph for the upcloseandpersonal diplomacy he 
relishes 
bush has done the same thing with other world leaders getting 
francois mitterrand the reserved president of france out on a 
speedboat ride in kennebunkport and taking a pleasantly bewildered 
egyptian president hosni mubarak up to baltimore to see a baseball 
game 
beforehand when bush pressed to spend a day together informally 
at scenic camp david some on the soviet side intimated that 
gorbachev preferred to work not relax in the great outdoors 
but the soviet president clearly savored the time at camp david 
even tooling through the woods at days end behind the wheel of a 
golf cart with bush hanging on precariously in the shotgun seat 
gorbachev praised his host as a political leader who is able 
in a very human way to engage in dialogue and cooperation 
we now have a good human relationship he said 
bush acknowledged they didnt narrow differences on the future of 
germany but the benefit of a meeting like this is once again 
you can talk in great frankness about it i have no suspicion about 
his position and i hope he has no suspicion about mine 
first ladies barbara bush and raisa gorbachev too appeared to 
have become fast friends over the long weekend they emerged from 
the white house arminarm and exchanged kisses on both cheeks as 
they bade farewell 
goodbye good luck bush called out as the limousine pulled 
away

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev anxious 
for western expertise and capital to boost his ailing economy on 
sunday celebrated multimilliondollar deals signed with chevron and 
ibm 
gorbachev said the agreements provided a solid pillar of 
support for a new era of superpower cooperation 
while we and the president were working and our ministers were 
also discussing things there were important contact discussions 
with various americans companies and some important decisions were 
made gorbachev said 
he mentioned both chevron and ibm by name in his remarks at a 
joint news conference with president bush wrapping up the fourday 
summit meeting 
the soviet leader made clear during his washington visit that he 
is hoping to entice many more american companies into doing business 
in the soviet union he also planned to meet on monday with south 
korean president roh taewoo hoping to boost trading ties between 
those two nations as well 
in addition gorbachev said sunday that he was planning on 
traveling to japan another capitalist country where the soviets are 
hoping to attract investment support 
the agreement the soviets signed with chevron corp on saturday 
would grant the san franciscobased oil firm exploration rights for 
development of the soviet unions largest newly discovered oil 
field an 8900squaremile region near the caspian sea 
officials said the reserves of the tengiz oil field could exceed 
25 billion barrels 25 times larger than those on alaskas north 
slope 
the agreement will allow chevron to dispatch a 20member 
technical team to the region 
the teams findings will form the basis for further negotiations 
on a possible joint production agreement with the soviets officials 
said 
gorbachev on sunday said the chevron deal had the potential of 
being worth 10 billion rubles which would translate into 625 
billion at the official currency conversion rate 
the other agreement signed by the soviets over the weekend was 
for ibm to sell 13000 personal computers for use in soviet schools 
while the purchase price was not disclosed stock analysts said 
the deal could be worth around 25 million to ibm the company said 
that shipments of the computers which cost between 2000 and 
3000 each before subtracting discounts for large purchases would 
start in september 
both the chevron and ibm agreements were examples of commercial 
contacts that would be facilitated by the trade agreement signed by 
bush and gorbachev on friday that pact faces an uncertain future in 
congress where many have insisted it will not gain approval unless 
gorbachev eases economic pressure against the independence movement 
in lithuania 
in addition to being a necessary first step toward drastically 
cutting tariffs on soviet goods sold in the united states the trade 
agreement would expand opportunities for us companies in the 
soviet union by reducing red tape and providing greater protections 
against copyright piracy 
chevron officials stressed that much work would have to be done 
before conclusion of a joint venture agreement with a soviet company 
to pump oil from the huge field 
for one thing they said there were environmental concerns to 
address the oil field lies along the caspian sea home to the 
sturgeon that produce caviar an important cash export for the 
soviet union 
but in the signing ceremony at the soviet embassy chevron 
official richard h matzke said that a joint production venture 
between the soviets and a giant us oil company made a lot of sense 
the soviet union is the worlds leader in oil production the 
united states is the worlds largest consumer of oil he said

a plo official said us policy is pushing the 
middle east into war a newspaper reported sunday 
farouk kaddoumi head of the palestine liberation organizations 
political department also criticized us threats to halt its 
dialogue with the plo if the group does not oust from its governing 
body the guerrilla leader who staged a failed seaborne raid on 
israel last week 
hani alhassan political adviser to plo chairman yasser arafat 
was quoted as saying that a break in the dialogue would be 
tantamount to rejection of peace in the middle east 
kaddoumi described current contacts with the united states as 
spreading illusions about the palestinianamerican relations 
rather than a true dialogue 
we say to the americans we dont trust what you are doing 
because you are pushing the middle east to a new war he said in 
an interview with the kuwait daily alwatan 
kaddoumi lashed out at the united states for its veto thursday of 
a un security council resolution that provided for sending an 
investigation team to the west bank and gaza strip which israel 
seized in the 1967 middle east war 
he vowed to turn the question of sending a security council team 
to the occupied territories into a headache for the united states 
by stirring more arab protests 
arafat and the plo have disassociated themselves from the 
abortive raid wednesday on an israeli beach israel foiled the 
attack and four palestinians were killed and 12 captured 
mohammed abbas leader of the palestine liberation front a 
faction of the plo has claimed responsibility for the operation 
arafat has refused to condemn the operation outright and rejected 
the us demand to remove abbas from the plo executive committee 
the united states has left the door open to halting direct talks 
with the plo if the demand is not met 
the dialogue was started following arafats explicit renunciation 
of terrorism

leaders of the two germanys said sunday that 
the superpower summit has improved conditions for the unification of 
their countries and praised us readiness to expand trade with the 
soviets 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said the summit between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
further improved the international conditions for the unity process 
between the germanys 
his foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and east german 
prime minister lothar de maiziere also said they saw the summit as 
improving conditions for german unity and disarmament 
the resolution of the uttermost aspects of german unity 
requires new and farreaching progress in the csceprocess in 
disarmament and in the overall cooperation between west and east 
especially in the area of economics kohl said in a statement 
the csce or 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe deals with military security economic cooperation and human 
rights 
kohl said however that progress in reducing strategic nuclear 
weapons the beginning of a worldwide ban on chemical weapons and 
the ending of nuclear testing were equally important 
in addition kohl said us readiness to expand trade with the 
soviets was of psychological importance to promote the reform 
politics of president gorbachev 
in an interview with west german government tv genscher called 
the summit a great success a great success with its positive 
aspects that will also have postive results on the developments in 
europe 
and that means also for the europeans and the unification of 
germany because relations of the two superpowers with each other 
have fundamentally improved 
de maiziere also interviewed by west german tv said the summit 
showed the superpowers were rethinking their approach to security 
the deciding message that i think i heard is that in the area 
of stabilizing security they are having new and very different 
ideas de maiziere said of bush and gorbachev 
they are trying not to define the security theme militarily 
not end it with rocket counting but with considerations of 
economic ties with cultural ties de maiziere said 
during their summit bush and gorbachev signed a treaty that 
drastically slashes chemical weapons the two leaders also issued a 
statement breaking the deadlock on efforts to reduce longrange 
nuclear arms 
in addition secretary of state james a baker iii and his soviet 
counterpart eduard shevardnadze have indicated that prospects for 
reduction of conventional forces in europe had improved the soviet 
union had been balking at a plan to cut the superpowers troops to 
195000 for each side in central europe 
gorbachev concerned about the military strength of a united 
germany has opposed bushs demand that the new nation be a full 
member of nato the issue was discussed extensively on thursday the 
first day of the summit but was set aside so the leaders could 
focus on other matters 
gorbachev had threatened to review the soviet defense strategy if 
a united germany insists on joining the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
the west german foreign ministry said baker will meet with 
genscher soon to give him a full report on the summit 
as of july 2 the two german nations will start to merge their 
economies and the west german mark will replace the virtually 
worthless east german currency 
east germanys first noncommunist government came to power after 
elections in march following the ouster of hardline communist 
leaders late last year

jury selection was to begin monday in the 
cocaine conspiracy and perjury trial of mayor marion barry but 
sources said defense attorneys met with prosecutors over the weekend 
to discuss a possible plea bargain 
barry is charged with 14 counts of cocaine possession and lying 
to a federal grand jury about his involvement with drugs 
sources familiar with the case speaking on condition of 
anonymity said barrys chief attorney r kenneth mundy us 
attorney jay b stephens and their representatives have met to 
explore the possibility of a plea agreement 
but the 54yearold mayor last week appeared determined to see 
the case through in the courtroom rather than accept an agreement 
that would require him to leave office 
barry has not said whether he will run for a fourth fouryear 
term in november a recent poll shows that his legal problems have 
not significantly eroded his political support 
barry was arrested jan 18 at a washington hotel in an fbi sting 
operation fbi cameras taped the operation and barry later admitted 
in a newspaper interview that he had smoked crack cocaine but he 
claimed the government was trying to kill him with a lethal dose of 
the drug 
prosecutors have investigated barry before the government closed 
out one probe in 1985 after trying unsuccessfully to prove that 
barry lied to a grand jury when he denied obtaining cocaine from a 
former city employee

incidentally our own position is that we find it unacceptable 
that we should have greater security than the united states of 
america in a situation like this we wont be able to move forward 
i would recommend to all our partners to give some thought to this 
position if decisions are made of the kinds that will cause concern 
to the soviet union this would not be beneficial to the soviet 
union this would not be beneficial to others as well so the 
question arises a united germany its advent on the horizon all 
this is very important and serious 
while applauding the germans desire to be united we must at 
the same time think about ways of preserving the balance that has 
been emerging and taking shape for decades and here is the central 
point if we were to adopt only one point of view then i would 
think that it would not be complete for it gives rise to concerns 
and if that is the case then we if there were no other way out 
but i believe that such a way out will be found to mutual 
satisfaction but if this were to be the only option and some 
would like to impose it on us and say that we reject this then we 
should go back and see where we are whats happening to our 
security what should we be doing with our armed forces which we are 
both reforming and reducing what should we do about vienna how 
should we behave there all these are matters of strategic 
importance for everything happening in europe is really the highest 
level of strategy 
this is one way one pathway which gives rise to some doubts or 
suspicions one that can certainly slow down things there is 
another pathway that we are offering let it be american or german 
or british we are not claiming to have it as our own we are 
claiming one thing only we want to see an option that would 
strengthen everything in europe rather than weaken things 
as to the second part its a question of pride well id say 
that the problem is not pride really if today i have to remind you 
once again that we lost 27 million people in the fronts in partisan 
detachments 27 million people during world war ii and 18 million 
people were wounded and maimed then i think its not a matter of 
pride but of justice supreme justice for these sacrifices of our 
people enable us to raise these matters with all nations and we 
have a moral right to do so so that everything that was obtained at 
such tremendous cost that so many sacrifices would not spell new 
perils so this is what i wanted to say and i think that this is 
what should be said 
president bush may i just add mr president may i just simply 
add in answer to your question the answer is no because our 
policy is not predicated on pride or on humiliation nor on 
arrogance it is predicated on what do we see from the us 
standpoint is the best for the future best for stability and 
peace in europe and elsewhere so it the considerations that you 
ask about have nothing to do with the formulation of us policy on 
these important questions im just going to do what i think is best 
for the united states and the rest of the free world and the 
soviets so were not dwelling on what you asked about 
question mr gorbachev you say that you have established new 
relations with the united states could you tell us how you are 
going to develop the process in the area of the pacific ocean and 
whether youre going to convene some kind of representative 
conference or meeting to discuss those matters with representatives 
of different zones 
president gorbachev it seems to me that i have already expressed 
myself in rather great detail on this score and it also seems to me 
that what i said back in vladivostok in krasnoyarsk remains today 
and i reiterate that approach this is not a thing of the past for 
the processes are beginning to develop in that region too which is 
inhabited by billions of people one way or another things will be 
more complex with due regard for the real specifics over there we 
must act with due regard for those specifics without copying blind 
the european process but borrowing something from it 
at this time i can say that what happened with armaments with 
inf missiles along the border with china and the kind of dialogue 
which is under way now between countries and finally the fact 
that we have traveled a certain distance toward a settlement of the 
situation in afghanistan all these are signs showing that there is 
a positive process emerging over there 
of course i think this road will be longer and more thorny but 
still it is especially necessary over there because those peoples 
need an opportunity to reallocate their resources to overcome a lot 
of social problems that have been accumulated this is number one 
and number two id like to say that following the intensive 
contacts we have had and the dialogue that were developing with 
india and now with china and other countries such as indonesia i 
am planning to go on a visit to japan so as to open that area for 
discussion so were going to intensify our efforts in that 
direction i wish to say right away that here too we must 
cooperate with the united states of america i said this before in 
my statements and now too i wish to reiterate it once again in the 
presence of the president of the united states of america

a former dairy princess talent contest 
winner accused of strangling another woman in a dispute over the 
man both women loved goes on trial monday in a case in which the 
facts arent in question but motives are 
the prosecution contends lori esker 20 strangled lisa cihaski 
21 in a fit of jealousy marathon county district attorney greg 
grau has portrayed ms esker a college junior who graduated from 
high school as an honor student as a woman unable to control her 
rage over the broken romance with bill buss a handsome 22yearold 
dairy farmer 
ms eskers version which she gave investigators has been that 
she acted in selfdefense fearful she could be killed during an 
argument with ms cihaski over buss 
friends have said buss was about to become engaged to ms cihaski 
after breaking off a summer romance with ms esker 
both the defendant and the deceased are the last people on the 
face of the earth you would expect to be involved in this kind of 
death and that makes the trial unique defense lawyer stephen 
glynn said 
ms esker resigned as marathon county dairy princess a award 
for leadership and talent in agriculture after being charged with 
firstdegree intentional homicide the charge carries a mandatory 
life prison sentence she has been free on a 100000 bond 
ms cihaskis body was found sept 21 in her car at the motel 
where she worked near wausau 
investigators for the prosecution and defense have interviewed 
more than 150 people about the case and more than 50 people could 
be called as witnesses said glynn 
jury selection starts monday in florence marathon county circuit 
judge michael hoover ruled a jury would be selected from florence 
county because of pretrial publicity in marathon county once a jury 
is picked the panel will be transported to wausau to hear the 
testimony 
last month hoover ruled that statements ms esker gave 
investigators including a confession that she strangled ms cihaski 
with a belt can be used as evidence in the trial 
i dont think there are a whole lot of factual disputes i 
think there are a lot of disputes concerning motivations for certain 
things glynn said i dont think this is a case with a lot of 
expert testimony i dont think it is a case with a lot of esoteric 
information floating around 
according to police and statements ms esker gave investigators 
ms esker drove on the night of the slaying from the university of 
wisconsinpark falls where she was studying agriculture journalism 
to the wausau area intending to patch up differences among herself 
buss and ms cihaski 
she drove by the motel where ms cihaski worked and waited in the 
parking lot until ms cihaski came out a fight broke out between 
the women when ms esker kind of implied she was pregnant by 
buss in fact she was not pregnant ms cihaski called ms esker a 
slut and grabbed her throat 
i thought she was going to kill me or really hurt me ms 
esker told investigators explaining she grabbed a belt in the back 
seat of ms cihaskis car and put it around her neck 
i pushed on her i dont know if it was the belt or my elbow 
ms esker said 
ms esker dumped out ms cihaskis purse found a mirror and held 
it up to her face to see if she was breathing ms esker also pulled 
a ring off the womans finger 
ms esker said she thought to herself oh my god i killed 
her 
i didnt mean to hurt her ms esker later told police after 
buss identified her as the only person who had recently argued with 
ms cihaski i know lisa knows that

gov mario cuomo surprised no one sunday when 
he told cheering supporters that he will seek reelection 
cuomo a potential 1992 democratic presidential contender was 
expected to win virtually unanimous support from delegates at the 
state democratic convention on monday 
the popular state chief would then run against pierre rinfret a 
millionaire economist and political newcomer chosen by republicans 
last week 
if he wins cuomo would serve his third fouryear term as 
governor 
the truth is matilda and i dont want to do anything else 
cuomo said as he and his wife visited the empire state plaza 
convention center where the democratic gathering will be held 
deborah ishlon a rinfret spokeswoman said the republican 
candidate would make no immediate comment on cuomos reelection 
announcement 
cuomo refused to promise that he will serve the full fouryear 
term if reelected keeping open the possibility of a 1992 
presidential effort 
that wouldnt work at all said cuomo of such a pledge 
what would make you believe it 
facing his third straight year of deficits cuomo recently 
approved a record 18 billion tax increase package to keep his 
budget balanced 
the canadianborn rinfret has promised to make cuomos handling 
of new yorks economic problems a cornerstone of his campaign hes 
already begun comparing cuomo to lameduck massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis who has grappled with state budget problems almost 
continuously since he lost the 1988 presidential race

question this question is directed at president bush but 
president gorbachev feel free to join in of course mr president 
about six weeks ago you suggested that your patience was nearing an 
end in regards to the lithuanian situation i was wondering if 
thats still the case if not what has changed and specifically 
have you received any assurances that the embargo will be lifted 
president bush no there have been no such assurances im not 
sure anything has changed i dont recall placing it that my 
patience is nearing an end but i have tried to make clear to 
everybody that we have not recognized the incorporation of these 
baltic states into the soviet union and therefore we have a 
difference with the soviet union they consider this an internal 
matter and we say that having not recognized the inclusion why we 
have a different problem 
but we had some good discussions of this i have been encouraged 
to see discussions going on over there between various leaders and 
lets hope the matter can be resolved because i havent lessened my 
view as to peoples aspirations for selfdetermination and i feel 
strongly about that thats a hallmark of american belief and 
policy and i havent changed one bit on that but i would turn it 
over to president gorbachev who has a different view on it 
president gorbachev i really dont even know what i can tell you 
now because two days ago in a meeting with representatives of 
congressional leadership i explained our position in great detail 
it seems to me that our position is constructive and convincing our 
constitution has recorded the right for each people to make a choice 
for sole determination up to and including secession we did not 
have laws or legislation that would regulate we did not have a 
mechanism that would regulate the implementation of that right now 
we have it recorded in the law so we are reforming our federation 
we are expanding the republics sovereign rights and we hope that a 
full federation is something that we are in vital need of to resolve 
all the problems that have been accumulated this is our conviction 
this is the way were acting 
and shortly in the next few days there is to be a federation 
council meeting convened to consider specific steps dates and ways 
of resolving this particular problem in specific concrete terms 
perhaps this particular process will develop in a way that would 
imply the presence of different levels of federative ties just like 
various ties or links between the republics this will be a new 
process new forms of links of the kind that would be in consonant 
with the purposes of our perestroika with the goals of reforming 
our federation this is one direction 
if nevertheless in the framework of this process some republic 
or other is going to raise this question and i am sure they will 
they must be addressed and dealt with in the framework of the 
constitutional process we want to see this happen precisely on the 
basis of the constitution any other different approach leads only 
to an impasse and the experience that we have by now not only with 
respect to lithuania but also with respect to other republics in 
terms of dealing with ethnic problems where some people are trying 
to resolve the problem by different methods without due regard for 
the constitution leads to exacerbation aggravation and 
confrontation and this is not beneficial either for people for 
their families or for the economy or for the overall atmosphere in 
our country 
the president of the soviet union just like the president of the 
united states of america and i happen to know the american 
constitution have as one of their main responsibilities to defend 
and protect the constitutional system i swore an oath of allegiance 
to the constitution and for that reason we are prepared and willing 
to address any issue including those that have been raised by the 
supreme soviet of the lithuanian ssr in the framework of the 
constitutional process 
this implies a referendum incidentally as to the referendum 
those who have engineered this kind of solution if i may say so 
regarding the statehood of lithuania will also address our own 
option and let the people decide after they make a choice im 
sure no fewer than five or seven years would be required for us to 
sort things out there will be this divorce proceedings under way 
for there are 800000 known lithuanians who live over there 
defense missiles navy theyre all there today lithuanias 
territory includes five areas that used to belong to byelorussia 
stalin ceded klaipeda which the soviet union on the basis of the 
result of world war ii received just as it did kaliningrad and 
eastern prussia it received lithuanian territory so they raised 
this question to return to russia these lands 
recently the president of france i held a press conference with 
president mitterrand of france just as im doing now with president 
bush here and i said listen in order to make a decision how to 
act with respect to overseas territories such as caledonia france 
has projected a period of 10 years how is it possible for us to 
resolve issues such as this overnight when people met pending the 
opening of the third congress of peoples deputies and put the 
question to the vote is that a responsible policy really i ask 
myself 
i really think that we are acting in accordance with a mandate 
from the third congress of peoples deputies and we have a vast 
reserve of goodwill and constructive spirit and we do our best in 
order to resolve on the basis of constitutional approaches this 
particular issue but any other way would be unacceptable 
i keep referring to well im not asking the president to come 
over to us and bring order into our house but i keep saying that 
president bush would have resolved an issue like this within 24 
hours and he would have restored the validity of his constitution 
within 24 hours on any state 
but we are going to resolve it we are going to do it ourselves 
with full responsibility i wish to declare here now for all of you 
to know that we are anxious to see this issue resolved in such a 
way as everybodys interests would be taken into account and within 
the constitutions framework

the remote volcano that formed the tiny 
island of kiska in the aleutian chain has reawakened after 21 years 
of dormancy 
the volcano erupted for several hours friday throwing a cloud of 
steamy ash thousands of feet skyward over the bering sea witnesses 
said 
kiska island is an uninhabited island that was occupied by 
japanese military forces in world war ii and later made a national 
historic landmark 
it is located about 100 miles east of attu island the 
westernmost tip of the aleutian chain 
witnesses 60 miles to the east at a us navy station on amchitka 
island first spotted the white steam clouds at about 10 am they 
reported watching the steam mix with a dark cloud of ash until 
weather conditions obscured the view about three hours later 
reeves air capt james fredenhagen who took off from amchitka at 
about 3 pm said he saw a small plume of steam was rising slowly 
from the 4000foot kiska volcano 
i classify it as a mild eruption he said we caught sight 
of it at 7000 feet you could see the haze it appeared to be 
coming from the crater 
kiska is one of 40 active volcanos in the aleutian chain said 
victoria avery a university of alaska graduate student working at 
the alaska volcano observatory 
the observatory doesnt monitor kiska volcano and must rely on 
reports from pilots and other witnesses for information ms avery 
said 
as far as magnitude it doesnt seem to be a major explosive 
event she said 
the last eruption noted at the mountain was in 1969 when six 
days of venting sent lava flowing over island tundra kiska volcano 
also was active from january 1962 to march 1964 spilling magma and 
spewing ash 
another dormant alaska volcano redoubt came to life last 
december after a 25year slumber it has spewed ash periodically 
since then redoubt is 115 miles southwest of anchorage

mikhail s gorbachevs visit to the american 
heartland on sunday recalled nikita s khrushchevs trip to iowa in 
1959 both soviet leaders were looking for ideas to rescue their 
failing farms back home 
khrushchev returned to the soviet union and ordered many farmers 
to plant corn like roswell garst did on his farm that khrushschev 
toured near des moines in place of the usual wheat 
the corn did not fare well on soviet farms all of which lie 
substantially to the north of the american corn belt in fact the 
44th parallel cuts across the very southern tip of the soviet union 
but climate is only part of the reason that soviet agriculture is 
so inefficient that food is rationed in many parts of the country 
and that the nation every year must import so much american and 
canadian wheat 
much of the problem lies in the collectivized system of land 
ownership and the governmentowned distribution system that 
gorbachevs reforms are just beginning to change 
gorbachev said in washington on friday that when he began his 
reforms five years ago he was naive to think minor tinkering with 
the soviet system would fix the economy 
there was no incentive there was no motivation for people to 
work he said 
waste is a big problem gorbachev has said 25 percent of his 
countrys crops are lost in harvest and storage soviet economists 
have estimated that from 50 percent to 75 percent of the potato 
crop a staple of the meatpoor diet rots or is lost before it gets 
to the table 
gorbachev has pushed through the legislature a law allowing 
longterm leases of farmland and limited forms of private ownership 
so far reformers have been unable to enact legislation that would 
allow private individuals to own farmland sell it to whom they 
choose and leave it to their heirs 
in 1913 four years before the bolshevik revolution tsarist 
russia exported 12 million tons of grain historians write that most 
of the peasants who made up 82 percent of the population were poor 
and that a primitive communal system led to small farms and poor 
yields 
but soviet commentators are now writing that agriculture took a 
turn for the worse when dictator josif stalin collectivized 
agriculture in 192932 millions of people starved in the resulting 
famine and livestock herds did not return to 1913 levels until three 
decades later 
a disproportionate number of soviet people remain on the farm 
246 million out of a population of 280 million versus 29 million 
in the united states with 245 million people 
the soviet collectives are overstaffed and need farm machinery 
and general reorganization that allow us farm to work with fewer 
people

prime minister margaret thatcher grasping what she 
called a significant olive branch from iran expressed deep 
respect for islam on sunday and said britain is anxious to resume 
diplomatic ties 
mrs thatcher however speaking on the bbc radio stopped well 
short of meeting irans demand to condemn british writer salman 
rushdies book the satanic verses 
instead she urged moslems not to put too much stress on the 
book which had been decried as blasphemous and provoked a death 
threat from the founder of irans islamic republic ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini 
iran has said the satanic verses is the main obstacle to 
restoring diplomatic ties and to tehran helping to secure the 
release of british hostages in lebanon 
on friday however the iranian foreign ministry 
directorgeneral hussein musavian said iran was prepared to 
discuss the rushdie dispute and a possible resumption of diplomatic 
ties provided britain first makes clear that it respects islam 
and moslems and condemns insults to islam such as those in 
rushdies book 
no such olive branch was offered to the united states by another 
iranian official sunday 
former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi now an influential 
hardline member of parliament said establishing us diplomatic 
relations is against islamic principles even to get back iranian 
assets frozen by the united states 
he spoke on the first anniversary of khomeinis death as a power 
struggle simmered between moderates and hardliners in iran 
mass demonstrations were planned in tehran on monday to honor 
khomeini 
there are those who say it is necessary to have good relations 
with the united states if we want to reconstruct our economy and get 
our assets and military spare parts back mohtashemi said in an 
interview with the daily kayhan made available to the associated 
press in cyprus 
this is precisely against the standards of and values of the 
revolution and the thoughts of the imam khomeini 
mrs thatcher said the offer to britain reached her through news 
reports and she had no additional information asked whether she is 
now more optimistic about the hostages release the prime minister 
replied 
i never like to raise false hopes but it looks as if we 
have a new significant olive branch put out to us 
anything that we can properly do we have the greatest respect 
for islam the greatest possible respect she added during the 
hourlong phonein on the bbcs world service we cant stop 
freedom of speech in our country 
musavian meanwhile denied a report in londons sunday times 
that iran had withdrawn khomeinis call to moslems in february 1989 
to kill rushdie 
neither i nor any other iranian official or indeed the 
government has the power to revoke that decree musavian told the 
ap in tehran 
iran severed diplomatic relations with britain in february 1989 
after khomeini issued the decree to moslems and britain refused to 
ban the book or condemn rushdie 
rushdie a naturalized briton who was born in india to a moslem 
family has been hiding under police guard since the death threat 
mrs thatcher on sunday also made no direct reference to the 
satanic verses or to the khomeini death threat 
but she said it was iran which had broken off relations and we 
have been anxious to start talks again to restore diplomatic 
relations 
the british hostages in lebanon are church of england envoy terry 
waite journalist john mccarthy teacher brian keenan who also has 
irish nationality and retired fighter pilot jack mann a fifth 
briton writer alec collett is reported to have been killed 
in addition six americans two west germans two swiss and an 
italian are missing 
most of the westerners are believed held by proiranian moslem 
captors

president bush and mikhail s gorbachev may be 
hailing a new era in superpower cooperation but a stillskeptical 
congress is moving toward confronting the soviet union on lithuania 
its doubtful that gorbachev can win the trade concessions from 
the united states he has lobbied for so hard without a gesture in 
return on his part on lithuania 
lack of major progress on the baltic stalemate guarantees that 
substantial congressional opposition will continue to the trade pact 
that bush and gorbachev finalized during their fourday summit that 
ended sunday 
and even as bush was asserting that there was no link between 
the agreement and lithuania his aides were suggesting he would take 
another look before sending the measure to congress 
at the joint news conference that ended the summit bush was 
reminded that he had said six weeks ago his patience was wearing 
thin on the kremlins hardline approach in the baltics 
but he showed no inclination to repeat such a comment though 
conceding gorbachev had given him no assurances that moscow was any 
closer to lifting its economic embargo on lithuania 
im not sure anything has changed bush said 
congressional opposition to granting new trade concessions to the 
soviets cuts across party lines and some of the most outspoken 
criticism comes from bushs own republican party congress is 
proving far less patient than bush on the issue 
senate majority leader bob dole rkans contends the senate 
needs some fairly ironclad assurances from gorbachev that 
lithuania will gain independence assurances he didnt grant 
sen alfonse m damato rny has vowed an allout battle 
against granting trade benefits to moscow we are in the strongest 
position weve ever been in with respect to the soviet union 
damato asserts we should not be giving them everything they ask 
for to bail them out 
thus if bush sent the measure to capitol hill immediately he 
would do so knowing its chances were poor 
for his part gorbachev reiterated soviet dogma that the baltic 
crisis is an internal one and he suggested that bush would act to 
restore constitutional order within 24 hours had a us state 
declared its independence 
those remarks may play well for gorbachev at home but dont seem 
likely to help his case with a stillskeptical us congress 
bush asserted anew on sunday that as far as he was concerned 
lithuania had no bearing on the trade agreement he signed at the 
summit with gorbachev thats it he said 
the president says he placed only one condition on the trade 
pact that moscow must pass a liberalized emigration law before he 
will send the agreement to congress the trade measure would open 
the way for granting moscow mostfavorednation status and the lower 
tariffs that come with it 
at the same time despite bushs public pronouncements there 
seems little doubt to anyone in congress or in the administration 
that approval of the trade treaty is solidly linked to lithuanian 
independence 
secretary of state james a baker iii said sunday that it would 
be very difficult in the current situation to get congressional 
approval of the trade measure 
and white house chief of staff john sununu was even more blunt 
there is no way the president of the united states is not going 
to consider a whole host of issues as he determines whether or not 
to send the trade agreement to congress sununu said 
sununu interviewed on abcs this week with david brinkley 
responded to a question on whether bush would consider gorbachevs 
attitude toward the baltic state in making a final decision on trade 
despite the presidents own assertion that there was no linkage 
there is going to be linkage with a whole host of issues 
sununu added 
although it wasnt publicly stated by any participants at the 
summit bushs decision to throw a major political gift gorbachevs 
way the trade agreement could mean that bush now expects a favor 
in return 
and that favor could be a lightening up on lithuania by the 
kremlin a gift that might be hard for gorbachev to deliver but 
which would certainly go a long way toward sealing the new 
atmosphere of cooperation both leaders proclaimed at the summit 
bush has called the lithuanian deadlock a thorn in the side 
of otherwise warming ussoviet relations 
there was a glimmer just a glimmer that something might be 
afoot towards resolution of the problem in gorbachevs closing 
remarks at sundays joint news conference 
his assertion that a highlevel council would be convened in 
the next few days to press the search for concrete solutions was 
being scrutinized by us analysts to see if it represented any new 
movement 
and while the initial assessment was unclear it might have been 
gorbachevs version of one of bushs favored phrases stay tuned

the archbishop of san salvador 
on sunday said the yearold government of president alfredo 
cristiani has failed to bring reform and has worsened the plight of 
the poor 
i believe that cristiani is working to maintain the system 
favoring a market economy which is making the poor yet poorer 
monsignor arturo rivera damas said during his sunday homily 
cristiani 42 took office june 1 1989 after defeating his 
centrist christian democratic opponent he called for the coming 
year to be the year of peace after 10 years of war with rebels 
of the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front 
only if 1991 is the year of justice the year to respect the 
dignity of mankind the year that ends impunity only then will 1991 
be the year of peace that we all want the roman catholic 
archbishop said 
by impunity he was apparently referring to death squads which 
have summarily executed many union church and peasant leaders few 
people have been convicted of such crimes 
more than 71000 people most of them civilians have died in the

frederick mellinger whose fredericks of 
hollywood introduced racy lingerie to a postwar america squeezed 
into white girdles and boring briefs has died of pneumonia he was 
76 
the purveyor of colorful risque underwear that included satin 
bustiers edible panties and peekaboo bras died saturday night at 
his home family attorney morton field said sunday 
mellinger said his success came because sex appeal is always in 
style born in the lower east side of new york city mellinger got 
his start when he lied about his age then 14 to get a clerical 
job at an intimate apparel firm where he learned the art of 
mailorder merchandising 
in 1946 he opened fredericks fifth avenue in new york a 
mailorder business selling products that his world war ii army 
buddies told him their girlfriends would like 
a year later mellinger moved the store to the west coast where 
the bright purple art decostyle headquarters on hollywood boulevard 
became a landmark 
the firm went public in the 1970s and is traded on the american 
stock exchange there are now 160 fredericks stores and sales 
topped 80 million last year said ellen appel a publicist who has 
worked for fredericks 
mellinger was the guiding spirit of the company designing 
brassieres with names like rising star and cadillac and 
teaching himself french spanish and german to deal with european 
suppliers personally 
he truly revolutionized lingerie in this country ms appel 
said when other people were making traditional white boring 
lingerie he was making very glamorous lingerie 
our clothes cosmetize a womans body mellinger said in an 
associated press interview in 1983 they dont just cover the 
body they take the good parts and enhance them 
catalogues featuring scantilyclad models and offering sex toys 
body oils and xrated videos were mailed to thousands of us homes 
making fredericks of hollywood a household name 
from the 1950s to the more liberated 60s and 70s fredericks 
continued to offer its collection of inflatable and pointed 
missile bras garter belts and gstrings 
he stuck by his principles ms appel said women in the 
70s during the heights of the liberation movement were picketing 
fredericks of hollywood 
he used to say fashions may change but sex appeal is always 
in style 
these days madonna and other entertainers flaunt 
fredericksstyle lingerie during live performances and department 
stores have begun to stock clingy unmentionables 
but styles do change and in later years some of fredericks 
stockintrade came to seem dated and tacky rather than risque in 
1984 the firm suffered its first yearly loss a 148000 shortfall 
mellinger stepped down as chairman and chief executive replaced 
by george townson townson set about changing fredericks image 
in current catalogues fredericks no longer offers sex aids 
bondage devices and xrated videos tasteful clothing and underwear 
are worn by wholesomelooking models 
and last fall the purple hollywood headquarters was painted gray 
private services were scheduled for monday in los angeles 
mellinger is survived by his wife harriett a son daughter and 
five grandchildren

archaeologists have unearthed seven 
2600yearold winged bulls and other artifacts in the first major 
discovery for many years at the ancient assyrian capital of nineveh 
state television said sunday 
manhal jabur chief of archeology in the northern city of mosul 
was quoted on television as saying the discovery will shed important 
light on the assyrian civilization that extended from the persian 
gulf to the mediterranean sea in the first millennium bc 
the television quoted jabur as saying the discovery was made 
several days ago by an iraqi team in downtown mosul close to the 
wall of ancient nineveh 
the artifacts found in the palace of king esarhaddon all 
believed to be 2600 years old included the huge winged bulls two 
other large statues and other important findings 
esarhaddon who ruled from 681669 bc rebuilt babylon after it 
was conquered and destroyed by his father sennacherib 
the son known for mastery of both military force and diplomacy 
conquered egypt defeated pharaoh taharqa and seized his capital 
memphis 
scores of iraqi and foreign archaeological teams have dug at 
nineveh about 250 miles north of baghdad since british explorer 
henry layard uncovered huge stone sculptures and inscriptions in the 
nearby assyrian capital of nimrud in the 1840s 
jabur said the seven stone bulls which were considerably 
damaged were found at the southern gate of esarhaddons palace 
assyrian kings used winged bulls to decorate the entrances of 
their palaces as if they were guards the seven bulls are marked 
with cuneiform inscriptions 
jabur said one statue represents a human body that could be the 
legendary sumerian hero gilgamish he is holding a lions head in 
his right hand and a sword in his left 
other artifacts found in the site were identified as tablets and 
inscriptions that could contain important information about the 
assyrian king and his era

antigorbachev protesters chanting free 
free and waving baltic republic flags greeted the soviet 
president as he arrived at the minnesota governors mansion sunday 
when mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa emerged from their 
limousine near the mansion at 225 pm they approached about 200 
protesters some of them waving flags of lithuania latvia and 
estonia but did not talk to them the soviet leader is known for 
his forays into crowds to shake hands and chat 
hes a very charming man but you have to remember he does have 
iron teeth said karin berkholtz a latvian among the protesters 
berkholtz said she objects to gorbachevs efforts to thwart 
movements for independence by the baltic states other protesters 
expressed contempt for soviet interference in afghanistan and 
discrimination against jews 
protest signs said hands off the baltics gorby go home 
united afghan association stop deadly designs in 
afghanistan and end russian imperialism 
sen dave durenberger a minnesota republican in the gorbachev 
motorcade said the friendly crowd shouting out welcomes to the 
soviet leader outnumbered protesters 
some people have some kind of a message to get across and they 
use these occasions for the message durenberger said but 99 
percent of minnesotans i think are pretty excited that he made the 
decision to come to minnesota 
outside the state capitol some protesters in a crowd of about 
1000 sang songs in baltic languages 
maybe he does have some good intentions but he doesnt show 
them said karlis lubuzis of robbinsdale leader of the latvian 
welfare association of minnesota he has a better reception in the 
united states and other countries than in his own 
about 5000 people of baltic descent live in the twin cities

students at beijing university hurled bottles and 
bricks from dormitory balconies at security forces sunday night and 
rallied on campus shouting get rid of premier li peng 
the protest came on the anniversary of last years june 34 army 
attack on prodemocracy demonstrators including students from 
beijing university and other schools hundreds and possibly 
thousands of people were killed 
the protest was the strongest such demonstration since the 
crackdown 
to prevent commemorations soldiers and police imposed the 
heaviest security beijing has seen since martial law was lifted in 
january many students had said they were too afraid to commemorate 
the anniversary 
that was not the case in hong kong where tens of thousands of 
chinese demonstrated we wont forget june 4 and we are not 
scared banners read in hong kong which reverts to chinese rule 
in 1997 police said 100000 people joined the march organizers 
said more than 200000 rallied 
smaller demonstrations were held in taiwan japan britain 
canada and the united states 
in beijing convoys of police vehicles with flashing lights and 
soldiers on foot circled the university district all evening while 
security forces checked vehicles at major intersections 
witnesses said the protest began when a small group of graduate 
students hurled bottles rusty bicycle wheels and other objects at 
security forces on the street beneath their dormitory windows 
the students then marched to other dormitories gathering 
hundreds of supporters and singing the internationale the theme 
song of the international socialist movement that was frequently 
sung by last years student protesters 
several students made speeches calling for an end to corrupt 
government and respect for intellectuals one student demanded that 
land be returned to the peasants and factories to the workers 
students shouted get rid of premier li peng of all the 
chinese leadership involved in the crackdown li is the most widely 
blamed and hated 
witnesses said at least one speaker was taken away by 
plainclothes police and that the students dispersed peacefully soon 
after that 
soldiers and police armed with automatic weapons sealed off the 
streets around the campus security forces detained about a dozen 
foreign journalists who had just left the campus and forced them to 
line up against a wall according to one american in the group 
guns were in our faces the american said on condition of 
anonymity he said the security officials knocked los angeles times 
correspondent david holley to the ground and hit his wife fumio 
before allowing the group to leave the holleys later were detained 
again but released after 15 minutes 
earlier sunday three chinese made small public protests on the 
edges of tiananmen square which last years protesters occupied for 
weeks 
one man approached a canadian broadcasting co television crew 
and tried to display a protest poster police immediately dragged 
him away as he shouted to bystanders in chinese rise up 
the canadian reporters said they were able to read only the 
opening words of his poster to all foreign journalists we have 
invented a new philosophy 
hours later someone threw handfuls of white paper money a 
traditional offering to the dead from a car as it drove past the 
square police immediately tried to shoo away bystanders and pick up 
the paper 
police also took into custody a woman who stuffed an 18page 
political essay into the pocket of a west german tv reporter 
the small protests came despite the heaviest security in beijing 
since martial law was lifted in january 
thousands of police and soldiers were stationed throughout the 
city to discourage commemoration of the crackdown tiananmen square 
the symbolic heart of beijing was closed to the public and 
encircled by paramilitary police soldiers loudly practiced martial 
arts next to the square 
last years prodemocracy movement began in april with marches by 
beijing students and grew into a nationwide movement involving 
millions of workers intellectuals and some peasants 
troops and tanks rolled into central beijing on the night of june 
3 and retook tiananmen square the attack lasted well into june 4 
and was countered by civilians throwing gasoline bombs 
when it ended beijings streets looked like a war zone strewn 
with burned tanks army jeeps and buses thousands of people were 
arrested nationwide in the months that followed and many remain 
jailed without charge 
since then only a few isolated protests have been attempted 
although anger over the army attack remains widespread 
chinese officials gathered sunday in the great hall of the people 
adjoining tiananmen square to commemorate another anniversary 150 
years since the 1840 opium war with britain the communist party 
regards the war as the start of foreign imperialist aggression 
against china 
in a park in western beijing police broke up a crowd of about 40 
chinese at the english corner where people studying english gather 
each sunday morning to practice the police took five people away 
for questioning

leaders of the centrist social democratic party 
voted to disband sunday because of waning electoral fortunes only 
nine years after it was founded in a dramatic challenge to britains 
established political order 
if we did nothing else we showed the importance of standing by 
your principles and policies which you think are in the best 
interest of the country said leader david owen after the national 
committee reached its decision 
owen helped form the party in 1981 to offer voters a centrist 
alternative to the conservative party and thenincreasingly leftist 
labor party but party membership had dwindled to only 6000 members 
and in a parliamentary election last month was even beaten by a 
spoof party 
labor led by neil kinnock has abandoned its support for 
unilateral nuclear disarmament unveiled a more centrist platform 
last month and recent polls show it leads prime minister margaret 
thatchers conservatives 
the social democratic partys national committee voted 175 to 
disband 
in a statement it said this is a very sad day for us and for 
many others who have campaigned for the sdp and believe in the 
values of social democracy 
owen and his two fellow members of parliament john cartwright 
and rosie barnes will continue to sit in the house of commons as 
independent social democrats 
owen and three other former cabinet ministers broke with the 
labor party in january 1981 and formed the social democratic party 
two months later unable to break through the conservativelabor 
grip on power alone the new party fought the 1983 and 1987 general 
elections as the alliance with the established centrist liberal 
party 
after winning only 22 of the 650 parliamentary districts in 1987 
a majority of the membership of the two parties agreed to merge as 
the social and liberal democrats 
owen and loyal supporters opposed to the merger remained social 
democrats 
in a special election last month to fill a vacant parliamentary 
seat the social democratic party placed seventh out of eight 
candidates and was beaten by the spoof monster raving loony party 
owen said he had no plans at this stage at least to rejoin 
the labor party where he served as foreign secretary from 197779 
and was seen as a potential prime minister 
he said he thought the majority of the partys members would not 
join another party 
there is a big unfinished agenda he said there will be a 
lot of people who will feel there is nobody they can vote for with 
fullhearted conviction now 
owens principal critic within the party john martin said 
the party had become a burden to dr owen he is pleased not to 
have it 
martin said he would want to call the party activists together to 
see what they would want to do but he could not say how they would 
react 
owen said the party was not short of money but we are very 
short of members 
we have been pretending to do rather more than we have been 
able to do mrs barnes said we cannot pretend to be a 
democratically based party with a membership now of just over 
6000

president vaclav havel called for a 
tough stance against terrorists sunday one day after a bomb 
explosion injured 19 people on a downtown square in the capital

that freedom and democracy are not understood by us as a situation 
when everybody can act as they please havel said in a national 
radio interview from his country home at lany about 25 miles west 
of prague 
on saturday afternoon a bomb in a plastic bag exploded on old

political leaders and others believe the attack was meant to disrupt 
czechoslovakias transition to democracy general elections are set 
for friday and saturday 
the fact that it happened such a short time before the 
elections is a clear indication that one of the probable culprits is 
somebody from the circles of enemies of this power and such enemies 
must be clearly shown they do not stand a chance havel told the 
radio without elaborating 
saturdays attack also drew strong condemnation from the 
countrys political leaders 
democracy cannot be stopped said jan urban leader of 
the civic forum in a statement released by the official ctk news 
agency sunday 
i am convinced that on behalf of all honest communist party 
members i can express my jusified indignation said vasil 
mohorita chairman of the czechoslovak communist party 
czechoslovakias transition to democracy had been virtually 
without violence the noncommunist government took over in december 
after the country ousted its communist leaders last year when a wave 
of democratic revolutions gripped eastern europe

whipping and rolling said wilma tuttle one of the 250 wedding 
guests 
it got where you couldnt see hardly anything at all then it 
was just real black and a lot of lightning said ms tuttle i 
was standing over there at the back door and all of a sudden it 
just sounded like like a big train roar 
the twisters killed eight people in indiana six of them in or 
near petersburg and one in illinois

the guests rushed into the basement before it hit but after it was

junkyard

blurred by darkness fear and confusion after the storms ripped 
through the town of 3000 saturday night destroying or damaging at 
least 270 homes 
last night all we could see were shadows but we could tell 
half our house was gone said laura britton now it looks even 
worse 
flooding that earned the town a state emergency declaration two 
weeks before now seemed trivial she said 
hundreds of people wandered through town staring at piles of 
bricks and twisted metal where homes and stores had stood 
right after it happened you couldnt see anything said 
keith burch whose home was damaged power was out people were 
screaming power lines were all across the road like cobwebs 
chris anderson and about 300 other musicians were in a building 
at petersburgs horonady park when a twister hit anderson who

said then it hit doors blew open windows broke 
anderson said he knew of no serious injuries at the park 
although more than 50 trees were scattered and cars were smashed 
trooper vinnie gieselman was dispatched to petersburg to check

grabbed my jacket and covered my head it was a rough ride 
gieselmans crippled car the back window shattered by a tree 
limb was towed out of petersburg on sunday it passed people 
picking through the debris of dozens of homes where few belongings 
remained in one piece

122yearold victorian home a fourth of his roof was gone in his 
front yard a handlettered sign said gone with the wind

tired and behind schedule mikhail 
gorbachev passed up a chance sunday to drop in on a pictureperfect 
farm in the american heartland but his loss was anothers gain 
farmers richard and cecilia brand said the food they planned to 
serve the the gorbachevs would instead be donated to a homeless 
shelter in st paul 
as a farmer weve been disappointed before said brand 
obviously were disappointed but all our friends and family have 
been great its been a lot of fun 
the soviet leader had requested the 25minute visit to a family 
farm as part of his 6hour swing through the twin cities area 
the brands and their neighbors put in a lot of work for the brief 
stopby at the property 45 minutes south of minneapolis they 
spruced up the farmhouse and barnyard and workers using a grader 
smoothed 3 miles of road leading to the brand farm from the nearest 
tarred road 
but after gorbachev and his wife raisa landed in minneapolis in 
the early afternoon running almost a halfhour late the soviet 
president scratched the farm visit from their itinerary according 
to anne edwards a spokeswoman for the planners of the minneapolis 
visit 
hes just tired us sen rudy boschwitz said in a 
television interview i think he wont get to san francisco until 
after midnight 
instead of the cozy gathering around a picnic table that had been 
proposed the brands and their family were invited to meet the 
gorbachevs on the airport tarmac just before their departure 
were going to make it a very special occasion said paul 
ridgeway lead us advance coordinator for the minnesota visit 
president and mrs gorbachev plan to spend time on the tarmac 
visiting with them theyre very sorry about this 
neighbor dick nielsens property on sunday morning played host to 
trailers that carried sheriffs patrol horses and news 
photographers worked from a temporary darkroom in his familys 
garage other neighbors let officials park cars in their driveways 
the agriculture economy has rebounded in much of the midwest 
following several disastrous years in the early to mid1980s that 
forced thousands of farmers off their land in the past few years 
farm land values have increased and debt has decreased 
the brands had said they wanted to show gorbachev a typical 
american farm although whats typical isnt clear in these days 
of largescale corporate farm operations 
the brands who run their 240acre farm with their two sons milk 
75 cows and raise alfalfa corn and soybeans in all they have 250 
cows 
the couple previously has been host to foreign visitors which 
they believe is due in part to their proximity to the twin cities 
and easy access to the minneapolisst paul international airport 
state agriculture department officials suggested the couple for the 
gorbachev trip

for the second time in six months city 
residents voted for a mayor sunday but the opposition claimed the 
balloting had been rigged as was an earlier annulled tally 
opposition leaders said the governing institutional revolutionary 
party was driving voters to the polls with fake documents and had 
taken thousands of opposition supporters off voter registration 
lists 
allegations of electoral fraud have frequently been made against 
the institutional revolutionary party which has controlled the 
government since the partys formation in 1929 party leaders have 
pledged to end fraud and corruption within the party 
the special election in uruapan a city of 450000 that is the 
second largest in the western state of michoacan was being held 
because the results of the dec 3 vote were annulled because of 
charges of fraud 
rep jose gonzalez morfin of the conservative national action 
party said sunday that his partys supporters had seen a pickup 
truck without license plates and government trucks carrying people 
with fake documents to vote reporters observed at least one such 
truck that appeared to be carrying on such an operation at one 
precinct 
at the same time people carrying voting credentials at the same 
precinct were turned away when electoral officials said their names 
did not appear on the voting list 
no electoral officials were immediately available to comment on 
the charges of fraud 
members of the centerleft democratic revolutionary party and 
national action party had said before the voting that many of their 
supporters had been eliminated from the rolls 
uruapan has been governed by a provisional administration since 
the state legislature canceled decembers vote count 
juan antonio chavez mendoza a democratic revolutionary member 
said saturday the governing party distributed 5000 voting 
credentials to its own members rather than the rightful owners 
he said some were given to people from other parts of the state 
who would be brought in to vote 
the governing party has denied the allegations 
jose rosario torres ramos the local democratic revolutionary 
chairman said the contest is so close that a few hundred votes 
could make a difference in the outcome 
uruapan 200 miles west of mexico city is one of more than 20 
cities where the democratic revolutionary party challenged victories 
claimed by the governing party in december the partys activists 
seized city halls in 21 communities around the state after those 
elections 
army troops ousted the protesters with tear gas and fire hoses 
four months later no injuries were reported 
michoacan is the birthplace of former presidential candidate

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev ended 
summit talks on sunday promising to work with president bush toward 
a solution to germanys military future but sternly warning israel 
and independenceminded lithuanians on other issues 
gorbachev said he had surveyed with bush new possible 
perspectives on germany one of them secretary of state james a 
baker iii said might be a political agreement between the north 
atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
i cannot say that we have reached agreement but that does not 
mean that our efforts were futile gorbachev said of his dogged 
and unsuccessful campaign to persuade bush that a unified germany 
should not be aligned against the soviet union 
bush at their joint news conference insisted that a united 
germany in nato would be stabilizing and said he did not think 
his differences with gorbachev on the issue had been narrowed during 
their four days of talks 
but the two leaders parted amicably the atmosphere and the 
results of this meeting make it possible for us to speak really of a 
new phase of cooperation gorbachev said 
baker will pursue the german question with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze while they attend a european 
security conference on human rights this week in copenhagen 
denmark and again in berlin later in the month 
conceivably there could be some sort of a political agreement 
of some sort to help the east and central europeans accept german 
membership in nato baker said on nbctvs meet the press 
there are some ideas for resolving the german question baker 
said he said those ideas came from the united states the soviet 
union and the nato allies among those were many that have been 
previously mentioned a more political role for nato and the plan 
forwarded by west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher to 
keep nato troops out of territory now part of east germany 
well keep wrestling with it he said 
other us officials said last week that gorbachev had proposed 
creation of a new alleuropean council to consider military 
questions arising from the impending merger of east germany and west 
germany among them would be the size of the german army 
on two other summit issues jewish emigration from the soviet 
union and the drive for independence in lithuania latvia and 
estonia gorbachev took a tough stand in reply to reporters 
questions 
having permitted jewish emigration to soar to an alltime high 
some 20000 exit permits were issued in may gorbachev aligned 
himself with arab leaders who he said had protested in acute 
terms the continuing settlement of jews by israel on the west bank 
and in gaza 
if certain conclusions are not reached in jerusalem the 
soviet leader said we must give further thought to it in terms of 
what we can do with issuing permits for exit 
bush meanwhile reiterated us opposition to further 
settlements on the lands surrendered by jordan and egypt in their 
1967 war with israel i will try to persuade the government of 
israel that it is counterproductive he said 
baker said the soviets had told him last month in moscow and on 
other occasions that they might suspend jewish emigration if 
refugees are permitted to live on the west bank and in gaza 
they have a great deal more trouble with that than we do 
baker said while the bush administration is opposed to the 
settlements it firmly supports jewish emigration he said 
bush said he would not consider lowering us tariffs on soviet 
imports until the soviet parliament enacts a new law establishing 
emigration as a right 
on the baltics an area of sharp disagreement although bush 
declined to let it stand in the way of a new trade pact with moscow 
the soviet leader insisted that the drive for independence be 
channeled through constitutional means 
any other approach gorbachev said leads only to an impasse 
our constitution has recorded the right for each people to make 
a choice for selfdetermination up to and including secession he 
said and he added the sovereign rights of the soviet republics 
were being expanded 
lithuanians and other people trying to resolve the problem by 
different methods without due regard for the constitution leads to 
exacerbation aggravation and confrontation gorbachev said 
this is not beneficial either for people for their families or 
for the economy or for the overall atmosphere in our country 
bush in turn called ussoviet differences over lithuania 
one of the thorns in the side of an overall relationship 
after gorbachev left a senior us official said the soviet 
leader was in full accord with bush that germans had the right 
to make a decision about nato membership by virtue of the 1975 
helsinki agreement signed by 35 nations 
its the first time he has done that with the president said 
the official who sought out reporters while insisting he not be 
quoted by name or be otherwise identified 
he said that he agreed that this was up to the german people to 
decide the official said well have to see what that means 
gorbachev speaking at the news conference on what he called 
external aspects of german unification meaning how the new 
country would relate to other european nations said the two sides 
had clarified their positions and we will continue our discussion 
in order to find a mutually acceptable solution

solidarity leader lech walesa who has in 
the past called for quicker economic reform said sunday he 
nevertheless backs the governments drive to introduce free markets 
he tempered his support however by saying he reserves the right 
to offer constructive criticism 
his remarks came as a rival but less powerful union renewed its 
attacks on the governments program to dismantle the centrally 
planned economy 
delegates at the rival opzz unions congress put the blame for 
the countrys problems on the reform plan 
opzz was the communist governments sanctioned union before 
solidarity was legalized last year and a solidarityled 
administration took power 
walesa addressing supporters sunday after mass in the baltic 
port of gdansk declared solidarity firmly supports the reform 
activities of the government it will support them but not 
uncritically 
walesa was speaking to a crowd of about 1500 people in the 
courtyard of st brygidas roman catholic church 
the governments radical economic reform plan has achieved its 
first major objective of ending threedigit inflation since the 
program took effect jan 1 
the plan slashed subsidies to staterun enterprises eliminated 
most price controls and introduced a tight wage policy more than 
400000 people have registered for umemployment benefits 
the government has sought assistance from the west to help make 
the complex transition but the amount offered so far has not met 
expectations 
let us remember that we can count only on ourselves nothing 
has come out of our alliances with the west like with our 
friendship with the east walesa said sunday 
at the final day of the opzz congress in warsaw on sunday miner 
rajmund moric declared that if the governments position does not 
change by midyear a protest action will be needed nationwide 
the union says the governments program is causing too much 
unemployment and making living standards decline it also objects to 
plans to privatize the state enterprises where many of its members 
work

president bush and soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev proclaimed an atmosphere of growing trust sunday at 
the close of their fourday summit they left unsolved nagging 
differences on german unity and independence for lithuania 
the leaders parted with smiles and warm handshakes and a decision 
to meet on a regular basis perhaps annually the soviet president 
invited bush to moscow a state visit that may take place before 
years end 
the soviet president and his wife jetted off to meet with 
business and farm leaders in minneapolis and an overnight stop in 
san francisco 
i personally believe that this summit will go down in history 
as a summit of hope and optimism gorbachev said at the beginning 
of his meeting in minneapolis i think that two or three days 
later or two or three weeks later we will really begin to 
understand what this meeting has produced 
on monday gorbachev has a reunion with ronald reagan and holds 
a firstever meeting with the president of south korea 
weve moved a long long way from the depths of the cold war 
bush said at a wrapup news conference sitting alongside gorbachev 
at the same mahogany table where they sealed agreements friday to 
slash longrange nuclear weapons halt production of chemical 
weapons and lift trade barriers against moscow 
the news conference was broadcast live in america and across the 
soviet union where mounting political and economic problems await 
gorbachev on his return 
gorbachev said the two leaders compared differences in an 
atmosphere of frankness a constructive atmosphere an atmosphere of 
growing trust 
barbara bush and raisa gorbachev who cemented a warm 
relationship over the four days sat beside each other at the news 
conference listening with earphones to the translations of their 
husbands comments 
despite the rosy assessments stubborn problems persisted 
bush said gorbachev offered no assurances that he would ease his 
economic stranglehold on lithuania the baltic republic struggling 
for freedom the us leader said the question of baltic 
independence was one of the thorns in the side of an overall 
relationship 
as for gorbachevs objections to a united germany belonging to 
nato bush said im not sure we narrowed them gorbachev said 
the european questions were matters of the highest level of 
strategy he said of germany without elaboration were not 
going to put spokes in the wheel 
separately secretary of state james a baker iii said he will 
explore a political agreement between nato and the sovietled 
warsaw pact to bridge the differences over a unified germany he was 
skeptical of an idea from a gorbachev adviser that the soviet union 
become a member of nato the 16nation western alliance 
overseas leaders of the two germanys said the summit improved 
prospects for unifying their countries and boosted chances for 
disarmament 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher pronounced 
the meeting a great success east german prime minister lothar 
de maiziere hailed new and very different ideas about 
stabilizing european security 
baker and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze will take 
up the german question on tuesday at a copenhagen human rights 
meeting and then again later in the month at the socalled 
twoplusfour unification talks these talks involve the two 
germanys and the four victors of world war ii the united states 
soviet union france and britain 
with impassioned words gorbachev said he was obliged to speak 
for the 27 million soviets killed in germanprovoked world war ii 
its not a matter of pride but of justice supreme justice 
we have a moral right 
the news conference was sprinkled with moments of humor when a 
soviet journalist asked gorbachev about his problems with political 
nemesis boris yeltsin he replied i dont think you have chosen 
the best place for clarifying our internal problems but cest la 
vie as they say 
on the contentious issue of lithuania bush said he did not link 
trade benefits for moscow with a relaxation of pressure on the 
baltic republic the only price he said was passage of a soviet 
law protecting jewish emigration thats it he said 
yet baker acknowledged it would be very difficult to win 
congressional approval of a trade treaty as long as the soviets 
crack down on lithuania and white house chief of staff john sununu 
said there is going to be linkage with a whole host of issues 
gorbachev demanded that lithuania follow a constitutionally 
prescribed route toward freedom including a referendum after that 
he said it would take no fewer than five or seven years to sort 
things out in what he called this divorce proceeding 
on germany bush said he and gorbachev agreed it was up to the 
germans to decide which military alliance they join after 
unification in accordance with a 35nation agreement known as the 
helsinki final act 
a senior administration official said the us side attached 
significance to gorbachevs agreement on that point the first time 
the soviet leader had done so nevertheless the official said i 
didnt say theyre buying our side were hopeful this reflects some 
movement 
gorbachev said he had offered many options on the question of 
germany it seems to me there are some points the american side 
has noticed he said 
soviet spokesman gennadi gerasimov ridiculed nato saying that it 
must be changed these letters may stand for navies aircraft 
tanks obsolete 
gorbachev used the news conference with bush to warn israel that 
he would give thought to suspending the issuance of exit permits 
for soviet jews if they continue to be settled on the disputed west 
bank or in gaza 
although bush is pressing moscow for free emigration rights he 
noted that the united states opposes new settlements 
the summit ended on a friendly note 
in a prepared statement opening the news conference bush said 
they had talked with candor and openness gorbachev responded 
with a paean to bushs statesmanship this is the kind of person 
to do business with gorbachev said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the two leaders 
were alike in some ways when they debate across a table they see 
a mirror image they even have a similar sense of humor they make 
fun of things they tease each other he said

recent murders of american soldiers by 
communist rebels and new threats have prompted the us air force to 
scale back a training exercise to keep all personnel on base us 
sources said sunday 
the latest killing of a us serviceman came saturday night near 
subic naval base but american officials said theft not politics 
was the motive 
about 1000 troops had been expected to take part in the twoweek 
military exercise which was to begin monday at clark air base air 
force officials said 
but the number was reduced to about 850 so that all personnel 
could be housed on the base 50 miles north of manila 
in honolulu air force spokesman maj james pasierb said the 
reduction would not affect the scope of the operation the final 
phase of this years cope thunder series of exercises 
he claimed the reductions were not prompted by communist threats 
i want to make it clear that we are not scaling back on the 
exercise because of any terroristic activity he said 
but sources at clark speaking on condition of anonymity said 
security was the primary consideration last month communist rebels 
killed two american airmen near clark and vowed more attacks until 
all us troops leave the philippines 
a us navy lieutenant was fatally stabbed saturday near subic 
but officials said the motive was robbery and not politically 
related the navy identified the victim as richard e brown 33 of 
spring valley ny 
on friday us officials imposed new travel restrictions on the 
20300 troops defense department civilians and military dependents 
stationed at clark citing the current threat conditions 
clark air base is in an area of central luzon island a 
stronghold of the new peoples army which has been waging a 21year 
insurgency to establish a marxist state 
during the six previous cope thunder exercises this year 
hundreds of airmen on temporary duty were housed in civilian hotels 
near the base because of a shortage of room on the base 
the policy was changed however after the rebels killed airmen 
john raven and james green in front of their hotel on may 13 the 
day before us and philippine negotiators opened talks on the 
future of the bases 
raven and green were on temporary duty from kunsan air base in 
south korea because their unit was taking part in cope thunder 
training after the killings hundreds of airmen were moved back 
onto the base and some were housed in the gym because of the housing 
shortage 
this weeks exercises also will include us units from japan and 
south korea 
us officials say training facilities in the clark area 
including the nearby crowe valley firing range are far superior to 
those available in japan and south korea

british foreign secretary douglas 
hurd urged israel on sunday to agree to direct peace negotiations 
with the palestinians and he warned of largescale violence without 
a middle east settlement 
speaking at the end of a twoday visit to saudi arabia hurd 
called on washington to maintain its constructive engagement as 
part of a fourpoint plan to reactivate the stalled middle east 
peace process 
a tremor of danger may shake the region and if things drift 
further we risk a damaging escalation of violence he said at a 
news conference 
hurd suggested that a un representative make a factfinding 
visit to the israelioccupied territories and report back to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the security of israel cannot be ensured by ignoring the 
existence of those whose territories her forces now occupy he 
said 
hurds suggestion points to a less binding alternative to a 
threemember investigative team considered by the un security 
council last week britain and the other members of the security 
council backed the resolution but the united states used its veto 
power to block it 
hurds plan to reactivate the peace process proposed 
first the united states needs to maintain its constructive 
engagement in the search for peace 
second there is room for a greater degree of international 
involvement to which the european community has consistently given 
its support some progress could be made by a representative of the 
un secretary general visiting the occupied territories and 
reporting on the situation there 
third the plo should not only reaffirm its denunciation of 
terrorism but respect it strictly in practice 
fourth an israeli government needs to carry forward the peace 
process by entering into dialogue with representative palestinians 
hurd welcomed the soviet unions more liberal emigration policy 
but termed the settlement of soviet jews in israels occupied 
territories as unjust and illegal 
the arab world is deeply worried by the prospect of soviet jews 
settling in occupied territories it is not right to correct one 
injustice and impose another hurd said 
in another development sunday a un delegation seeking a 
nuclearfree zone in the middle east began a twoday visit to 
israel which is reportedly the only country in the region with 
atomic weapons 
the threeman delegation was named in 1988 to prepare a report 
for the un secretarygeneral on ways to advance nuclear 
disarmament in the middle east the team has already visited egypt 
jordan syria iran and iraq

a government minister on sunday asked mikhail s 
gorbachev to visit the occupied territories to see himself that 
israel has no policy of settling jewish immigrants there but the 
soviet president said the time was not right 
the invitation was extended by absorption minister yitzhak peretz 
after gorbachev warned israel he would consider suspending exit 
permits for soviet jews if they continue to be settled in the 
territories 
gorbachev in minneapolis after wrapping up his fourday summit 
meeting with president bush in washington earlier in the day was 
asked if he would be interested in traveling to israel 
i will be frank the time has not yet come to go there he 
said in russian let the leaders of israel think about what has 
been said today in washington so they dont turn out to be the only 
people in the world who dont understand 
president bush who joined gorbachev at a concluding news 
conference in washington repeated that the united states is opposed 
to further settlements in the lands captured by israel from the 
arabs in the 1967 middle east war 
i will try to persuade the government of israel that it is 
counterproductive bush said 
avi pazner spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israel was not directing soviet immigrants to the gaza strip and 
west bank 
it is well known that israel does not have a policy of 
directing the new immigrants from the soviet union or elsewhere to 
the territories pazner said the new immigrants have the 
freedom to choose where they want to live 
pazner said only a few hundred people had chosen to live in 
the occupied lands he said the arab states were using them to mount 
an offensive against jewish immigration from the soviet union to 
israel 
in washington gorbachev had said the soviet union is being 
bombarded by a lot of criticism from arab countries regarding 
israels immigration policies 
presidents hafez assad of syria and hosni mubarak of egypt raised 
their objections in acute terms he said 
gorbachev said that if israel does not heed appeals to keep 
jewish immigrants from settling in the occupied lands we must 
give further thought to it in terms with what we can do with 
issuing permits for exit 
some in the soviet union he said have suggested that the 
government postpone issuing permits for exit to put it off 
until israel provides the necessary assurances 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
about 35000 soviet jews arrived in israel this year and the figure 
is expected to reach as high as 150000 about 1 million soviets are 
seeking permission to emigrate 
israeli officials say only 200 soviet jews have settled in the 
occupied areas joining 70000 jewish settlers who live there amid 
17 million palestinians 
peretz who said he was authorized by the government to extend 
the invitation to gorbachev asserted that soviet jews who settled 
in the occupied lands this year and last did so on the basis of 
family reunification 
deputy prime minister david levy said gorbachevs warning 
violated his own policy of extending greater freedom to soviet 
citizens 
the soviet union is changing direction and it cannot be that 
only regarding jews it would take a step that leads it backward and 
not forward to progress and freedom he said 
the soviet leaders remarks also were sharply criticized by us 
jewish leaders 
malcolm hoenlein executive director of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations said the comments 
were doubtlessly a response to the unrelenting arab campaign to 
halt jewish emigration 
but even to suggest a restriction of jewish emigration to 
israel is unacceptable

mikhail gorbachev threw police for a loop 
and onlookers into a frenzy sunday by repeatedly making unscripted 
plunges into crowds to shake hands and chat 
the soviet president left his limousine to greet crowds before a 
luncheon at the governors mansion crossed the street after lunch 
to the delight of another group and walked the street a third time 
near the st paul cathedral 
one stop he didnt make disappointed both admirers and 
protesters his motorcade didnt even slow down during its 45second 
trip around the state capitol where an estimated 6000 people had 
waited seven hours in damp and chilly weather 
earlier through an interpreter at one of his impromptu stops 
gorbachev told the crowd thank you all for your feelings the 
soviet people have just as much respect for american citizens as you 
do i wish happiness and wellbeing to the people of minnesota and 
this state 
gorbachev smiled broadly and nodded to the crowds occasionally 
saying a few words supporters shouts of gorby gorby mixed 
with jeers from protesters 
crowds held signs reading we love mikhail raisa mr 
gorbachev is a cool dude and give gorbachev the nobel peace 
prize 
after lunch at the governors mansion gorbachev waded into the 
throngs outside and walked more than a block he talked for about 
two minutes with 11yearold brandon peterson but it was not 
immediately known what the two said 
gorbachev got back into his car but had the motorcade stop 
again security ropes were either down or nonexistent and police 
used loudspeakers to tell the crowd to back off the street 
gorbachev stuck his hand out his car window and waved at the 
throng outside the capitol but his face was only barely visible 
many people ran the length of the capitol lawn leaping hedges 
and jumping curbs hoping for a better look 
i was a little disappointed because he is one of the most 
important people that ever lived said helene turnbull of 
minneapolis but it was worth the wait seeing all the excitement 
it did go pretty fast said shelly hanson who along with 
her husband son daughter and nephew made a 2hour trip from 
alexandria and then waited two hours for the motorcade to arrive 
i think his actions proved he doesnt care about real people 
that he only wants to meet business people said vivita 
rozenbergs a minneapolis resident of baltic ancestry his actions 
speak louder than his words

novelist salman rushdie on sunday praised a chinese 
students account of the tiananmen square repression as an important 
testament to beautiful and terrible events 
rushdie who has been in hiding since iranian religious leaders 
called for his death last year for alleged blasphemy of islam in his 
novel the satanic verses reviewed the book moving the 
mountain by li lu in the weekly independent on sunday 
li escaped from china one month after the army crackdown against 
prodemocracy students on june 34 last year in beijing and is now 
studying in the united states in london on sunday he told an 
anniversary rally that the movement will rise again 
in his review rushdie recalled the collapse of communist rule in 
eastern europe last year and said this weekends anniversary of the 
crackdown on the prodemocracy students in beijing was a time to 
remember that 1989 was a year not only of miracles but of horrors as 
well 
lis book published in london by macmillan tells of his boyhood 
during chinas cultural revolution he was handed over to a coal 
miners family to be brought up because his parents had been 
denounced as intellectuals 
li was a student at nanjing university when he joined the 
students in tiananmen square he became one of the leaders and just 
before the repression married his girlfriend in the square he left 
china but gives no details nor say if his bride went with him 
rushdie said in his review no doubt in time there will be 
calmer less hurried responses to the appalling events of last year 
in beijing no doubt other surviviors will emerge to tell us their 
stories 
but li lus book rough and ready as it is is an important 
one he is the first witness to speak and what he witnessed was 
beautiful and terrible almost but not quite beyond words 
rushdie has remained in hiding since iranian officials pronounced 
the death sentence feb 14 1989

mikhail s gorbachev got a firsthand 
look sunday at 32 million worth of computers his country hopes will 
improve the safety of nuclear power plants 
in remarks to a few hundred people at the headquarters of control 
data corp the soviet president said he hopes the six control data 
computers the soviets have agreed to buy will prevent another 
disaster like chernobyl 
we cannot really do without nuclear energy today he said 
this particular type of energy has a lot of advantages but it also 
has risks 
what can we do to make it as safe as possible this is 
something we must pursue especially in the civilian sector we do 
welcome and applaud this new step in our economic cooperation 
control data was the final stop on the sevenhour visit to 
minnesota by gorbachev and his wife raisa but mrs gorbachev 
didnt accompany her husband as scheduled instead extending her 
visit to a minneapolis family 
i was told your state is a closed state gorbachev said 
right now it is beginning to open toward the soviet union see how 
fast things are changing 
the six mainframe computers to be exported to the soviet union 
will be used as information banks to make decisions on handling 
accidents performing maintenance building new plants and 
decommissioning old ones said control data executive scott harris 
the chernobyl accident in 1986 occurred while soviet scientists 
were running a physical test on the plant and it may have been 
possible to run that test as a mathematical model on a computer 
harris said 
earlier gerald r giombetti vice president of international 
trade for control data said the us government has indicated it 
soon will approve export of the computers 
the united states requires safeguards to ensure that the 
computers will be used strictly for their intended purpose he said 
the biggest concerns were raised by the pentagon giombetti said 
its the fear of a dual use he said even though it is a 
civilian application the big concern is that this is at a nuclear 
site 
control data has been doing business in the soviet union for more 
than 20 years the first americanbuilt mainframe in the ussr was a 
cyber 1604 installed at the joint institute for nuclear research at 
dubna in 1968 the deal was made during the thaw in ussoviet 
relations known as ostpolitik 
the pending sale of nuclear safety computers would be control 
datas first deal with the soviet union since 1979 when trade was 
restricted by president carter after the soviets invaded 
afghanistan giombetti said

one purpose of mikhail gorbachevs 
visit to minnesota was to inspect some merchandise 32 million in 
control data corp computers to be used to improve the safety of 
soviet nuclear power plants 
the soviet president and his wife raisa hoped to make a brief 
swing through control datas headquarters as part of their 6hour 
visit to the twin cities 
although the company has slipped from the top ranks of the 
nations computer makers in recent years its more than 20year 
history of commercial ties with the soviets was believed to be a 
factor in the visit 
the six mainframe computers are to be delivered to plant and 
research sites in four soviet cities said gerald r giombetti vice 
president of international trade for control data they would be the 
most powerful computers ever exported to the soviet union 
giombetti said the us government has indicated it will approve 
export of the computers soon the united states requires safeguards 
to ensure the computers will be used for their intended purpose and 
not for military purposes he said 
weve had a lot of dialogue with the us government at very 
high levels said giombetti who noted the biggest concerns were 
voiced by the defense department its the fear of a dual use 
even though it is a civilian application the big concern is that 
this is at a nuclear site 
control data executives scott harris and bill selden said the 
machines wouldnt be used to run nuclear plants instead they are 
to be used as easyaccess information banks to make decisions on 
handling accidents performing maintenance building new plants and 
decommissioning old ones 
harris and selden said the purchase was driven partly by the 
chernobyl nuclear accident which occurred while soviet scientists 
were running a test on the plant 
it may have been possible to run that test as a mathematical 
model on a computer harris said 
control data has been doing business in the soviet union for more 
than 20 years the first americanbuilt mainframe in the ussr 
was a cyber 1604 installed at the joint institute for nuclear 
research at dubna in 1968 during a thaw in ussoviet relations 
the pending sale of nuclear safety computers would be control 
datas first deal with the soviet union since 1979 when president 
carter imposed trade restrictions after the soviets invaded 
afghanistan giombetti said 
control data also has agreed to sell the soviets about 6 million 
worth of computer equipment for oil exploration the soviets have 
made this area a priority and gorbachev announced an oil exploration 
agreement had been signed with chevron corp during the washington 
summit 
rick berglund a control data spokesman said the approval 
process for the oil exploration equipment is just beginning 
the equipment sales come at a time when control data is 
struggling to turn around years of losses and shift its business 
more toward computer services the company lost a total of 14 
billion in the second half of the 1980s and was forced to retrench 
selling subsidiaries that made computer chips and disk drives and 
folding its supercomputer business 
computer products still make up the largest division at control 
data but demand for the companys upperrange mainframes has 
declined in each of the past two years

china this summer will open what it says is the 
first futures market in a socialist country an official newspaper 
reported 
the market will open in august in the central city of zhengzhou 
and will handle wheat transactions the china daily said sunday 
if the market is successful the government may open futures 
markets for corn in the northeast city of changchun rice in the 
central city of wuhan and pigs in southwest chinas sichuan 
province the paper said 
in the past china has branded futures markets as a form of 
capitalist speculation the nations conservative leaders have 
stressed that market forces must play a subsidiary role in chinas 
planned economy 
a futures market allows traders and producers to negotiate a set 
price for a commodity at a given future date the seller is 
guaranteed that price regardless of subsequent fluctuations in the 
market 
although most chinese agricultural products must be sold to the 
state for a set price an estimated 65 million tons of agricultural 
commodities circulate in the free market every year 
poor regulation of the free market has led to wild price 
fluctuations for produce and livestock and serious supplydemand 
gaps 
the paper said foreign dealers will not be allowed to participate 
in the zhengzhou market at the outset 
but in february the chicago board of trade signed a memo of 
understanding in which it agreed to help the chinese government set 
up futures markets

robert noyce who revolutionized electronics 
by coinventing the semiconductor and later sought to revive 
american chipmaking as head of the governmentindustry consortium 
sematech died sunday of a heart attack he was 62 
noyce suffered a heart attack at his austin home sunday morning 
and was pronounced dead minutes after his arrival at seton medical 
center hospital spokeswoman elizabeth mcdonald said 
working separately in the late 1950s noyce and jack kilby 
invented the integrated circuit which made rapid gains in computer 
power possible by putting multiple transistors on a single chip 
the silicon valley pioneer also was one of the founders of intel 
corp the nations thirdlargest semiconductor producer and fought 
for the creation of a consortium to promote the american industry 
he was really a legend within the electronics industry 
spokesman jim jarrett said from intels santa clara calif 
headquarters 
he was always referred to as the mayor of silicon valley 
because he was such a respected and loved figure in the industry 
bob was an instrumental figure in creating what has become a 
50 billion industry and semiconductors are the driving force behind 
a 500 billion electronics industry said stan victor a spokesman 
for texas instruments inc he will be missed 
in 1988 noyce was appointed as the first chief executive officer 
and president of sematech which was set up to help the united 
states recover world leadership in semiconductor manufacturing 
that leadership was essential to the nations economic and 
military security he said and american companies would have to 
adopt the cooperative practices of their japanese competitors to 
regain it 
after first taking himself out of the running for the job noyce 
said he accepted the post because it finally dawned on me it was 
far too important for someone else to do i had to do it myself 
the austinbased consortium which includes intel texas 
instruments and 12 other us chip makers has an annual budget of 
200 million provided by the government and manufacturers 
sematech spokesman joe stroop said the consortiums management 
was deep enough to withstand noyces death 
noyce had asked sematechs directors last april to begin a search 
for his eventual successor stroop said noyce did not said when he 
wanted to step down but had indicated he was willing to relinquish 
daily operational control he said 
noyce had established a threemember management team consisting 
of himself chief operating officer turner e hasty and chief 
administrative officer peter h mills stroop said 
the office of chief executive will continue to function while 
we search for a successor he said 
theres a very solid infrastructure there and it should 
continue on with no problem intels jarrett said of the 
consortium 
in addition to his sematech duties noyce had retained his title 
as intels vice chairman and was an active member of the board of 
directors jarrett said 
noyce was born dec 12 1927 in burlington iowa he was 
graduated from grinnell college in grinnell iowa with bachelors 
degrees in physics and mathematics and membership in phi beta kappa 
noyce earned his phd in physics from the massachusetts institute 
of technology in 1953 
he became a researcher at philco corp then later moved to the 
shockley semiconductor laboratory he cofounded fairchild 
semiconductor corp in 1957 where he and kilby of texas instruments 
separately invented the integrated circuit 
in 1968 noyce and longtime associate gordon e moore founded 
intel corp 
noyce was awarded the national medal of technology by president 
reagan in 1987 and the national medal of science from president 
carter in 1980 he was inducted into the national inventors hall of 
fame in 1983 and elected to the us business hall of fame last year 
in february noyce and kilby were presented the first charles 
stark draper award by president bush 
integrated circuits have enabled us to do the unimaginable 
bush said at the awards ceremony now it is unimaginable to 
believe we could ever live without them the microchip helped 
america change the world 
noyce held 16 patents for semiconductor devices methods and 
structures he was a founding member and first president of the 
semiconductor industry association 
he also was a member of the national academy of science national 
academy of engineering and the american academy of arts and science 
noyce is survived by his wife ann bowers four children and 12

soviet president mikhail gorbachev pleaded 
with some of americas most prominent capitalists sunday for their 
cooperation in reforming his countrys sputtering economy 
the important question is what kind of soviet union does the 
president and the us people want to see gorbachev asked during 
a 90minute session with businessmen at a hotel a soviet union 
that is in turmoil or a noble democratic state that is moving 
he said the soviet union has spent the last five years sorting 
out ways to reform its centrally planned economy into one that is at 
least partly marketdriven among other things the soviets will 
need help in changing decadeold management ideas he said 
the old system of running the economy has become weaker and the 
entire structure of the market economy is only beginning he said 
it is very difficult to abandon those old ways 
the recent unveiling of an economic reform plan that called for a 
doubling of some food prices and the gradual privatization of some 
state enterprises triggered panic buying that left store shelves 
bare in some soviet cities 
gorbachev said the soviet economy is troubled because it is 
caught in a period of change if economic reforms are successful he 
said civic unrest will end 
when we begin such a project we feel we need american business 
because it is so big gorbachev said 
the soviet leader expressed gratitude for 150 joint business 
ventures now under way with companies in the us the deals are 
improving soviet efforts in food distribution automation medicine 
and farming he said 
american companies doing business in the soviet union will be 
rewarded with expanded business in the future gorbachev said he 
warned that those who just stand on the sidelines who do not want 
to risk will remain on the sidelines when the soviet economy is 
prospering 
gorbachev was welcomed to the hotel by dwayne andreas chairman 
of archerdanielsmidland co one of the united states leading 
farm products companies 
to me gorbachev is the man of the century andreas said 
when gorbachevs visit to minnesota was first announced soviet 
organizers said the business meeting was his biggest priority he 
was to take questions from the executives at the end of the session 
the 145name guest list included general motors corp chairman 
roger smith international business machines corp chairman john 
akers august busch iii of anheuserbusch co roger enrico of 
pepsico h lawrence fuller of amoco corp frank popoff of dow 
chemical co and whitney macmillan of minnesotabased cargill inc 
the private grain marketer that is the soviet unions largest 
private trading partner
