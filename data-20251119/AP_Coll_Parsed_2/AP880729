paris is swinging to those old bedouin blues songs 
that once were chanted by algerian shepherds to their sheep are now 
drawing flocks of hip parisians to dance in city clubs 
the music is called rai pronounced rye like the bread 
it is the latest sound rocking on french radio a harddriving 
electrified wail that makes it hard to stay still 
by fall the pulsing arab pop likely will be rolling from radios 
across europe and the united states as record companies already 
cashing in on the worldwide popularity of ethnonew wave begin 
promoting the music of northwestern algeria 
bedouin sheep herders were the first to sing rai punctuating 
langorous melodies and improvised lyrics on algerian angst with the 
refrain ya rai ya rai the nomad equivalent of oh yeah 
during world war ii the music shifted from fields around the 
western town of oran to bars and brothels in algiers where rai 
singers borrowed american jazz riffs learned from black soldiers 
just as they had taken flamenco passion and the paso doble from 
spanish settlers in oran decades before 
in 1981 an algerian record producer realized it was cheaper to 
synthesize drums than pay a drummer adding the drum machine was 
the birth of rai pop traditional minorkeyed melodies with a rock 
n roll beat big hits followed like ana ma hlali ennoum 
personally i dont appreciate sleeping anymore and nsel 
fik you belong to me 
who cares if the arabic slang belted out by the young rai stars 
is incomprehensible to the average parisian the melodies are 
haunting and the driving 44 beat swings 
rai is not poetry cheb khaled the charismatic elvis of 
arab funk told the daily newspaper liberation which has two 
reporters writing exclusively about arab culture 
rai speaks directly to people about what is happening in their 
lives the things i sing about i have lived said khaled 
khaleds new album kutche was released june 7 in france 
it is the first topquality hightech rai disk produced by a 
western record company emipathe marconi based here 
in august three other rai albums by a major british record 
company are scheduled for release in the united states england and 
continental europe including one by chaba fadela a female 
vocalist with a rough sensual voice who has sung duets with khaled 
the three disks will be marketed by virgin records all have 
attracted the attention of american disk jockeys said jumbo van 
renen of mango records in london a division of virgins island 
records 
van renen first heard rai in obscure paris clubs four years ago 
he was fascinated by the freshness of the sound and saw its 
commercial potential 
there is a growing interest in global excellence and language 
is no longer a barrier van renen said in a telephone interview 
from london rai is part of the new trend toward world music it 
is a sound that in the tired world of rock n roll is good and 
new 
rai is the latest trend in the globalization of pop paul 
simons grammywinning graceland owed much of its uniqueness to 
the a capella south african male choir ladysmith black mambazo 
which opened singer joan baez soldout paris gig in june 
musicians from antigua to zaire are finding new fans around the 
world 
a festival in 1986 that marked the debut of a several rai 
singers in france attracted 5000 people a day during the three 
days of concerts the music quickly began attracting audiences of 
nonnorth africans the target market for khaleds new release 
kutche takes its name from the algerian version of the 
spanish word for car coche reflecting the multicultural 
roots of the music 
the records instrumentation is a cultural melange as well 
khaleds mellifluous passionate voice pours over synthizers 
accordions violins traditional north african flutes algerian 
bendirs tamborines arabic derboukas drums and several african 
percussion instruments 
martin meissonier who produced khaleds album launched 
nigerian bandleader king sunny ade and is credited with introducing 
african music to the developed world 
he called rai lyrics apolitical but algerian authorities banned 
rai from the radio until three years ago saying lewd lyrics on 
wine women and life in algerias fast lane had no place on moslem 
airwaves they since have changed their minds and see the music as 
a way to reach the young 
rai touches people because it is more than simply music 
meissonier said like reggae it is an attitude rai is a way of 
life

presidential athletics often makes 
people think of touch football in the kennedy white house but 
herbert hoover invented a sport that makes those games look like 
tea parties say devotees of hooverball 
hooverball is not a sport for wimps said scott sailor who 
is organizing the 1988 hooverball national championship aug 7 in 
west branch hoovers birthplace 
hooverball is like volleyball played with a sixpound 
medicine ball except players must catch the ball and heave it back 
over the eightfoot net the hardest play may be serving from 33 
feet away or receiving serve where the ball comes crashing down 
faster than the stock market in october 1929 
one of the reasons for the tournament is that hoover has had a 
bad reputation in history people think of the depression when his 
name is mentioned said sailor parttime special events 
coordinator for the hoover presidential library and museum here 
we want to show there is more to hoover we want to show a 
more personal side he said 
a medicine ball is constructed with a bag of sand at its core 
which is wrapped in cotton matting and covered by leather used 
primarily by boxers whose trainers bash them in the stomach with 
it while they do situps the ball is heavy and difficult to catch 
when it comes flying down 
when hoover the nations 31st president took office in 1929 
he carried a portly 210 pounds on a 5foot11inch frame his 
physician admiral joel t boone was concerned and advised 
excercise 
the republican president strung up a net on the south lawn of 
the white house and ordered cabinet members and other dignitaries 
to divide into two teams 
except for sundays hoover cabinet members and supreme court 
justices played the game every day national holidays included 
from 7 am to 730 am regardless of weather 
teams of two to four players must catch the ball on the fly and 
return it without passing a point is won when the opposing team 
fails to catch the ball or throws it out of bounds 
it required less skill than tennis was faster and more 
vigorous and therefore gave more exercise in a short time 
hoover wrote in his memoirs 
stopping a sixpound ball with steam back of it returning it 
with similar steam is not pinktea stuff 
hoover lost 25 pounds playing the game but like his hopes for 
a second term the game faded away 
sailor and members of the hoover library are reviving it 
however with the tournament held in observance of hoovers birth 
in 1874 
sailor said two teams from kansas city mo including a writer 
from sports illustrated will participate as will about a dozen 
other ragtag squads

a union representing 12000 eastern airlines 
employees seeks to block the carrier from eliminating service in 14 
cities in a lawsuit that contends the cutbacks will eventually 
destroy the company 
the suit requests a preliminary injunction or temporary 
restraining order against the cutbacks in service scheduled to 
take effect aug 31 eastern announced the changes along with a 
work force reduction of 4000 last friday 
unless the cutbacks are blocked the suit says eastern will 
embark on a program that will significantly increase its 
recurring losses and lead to the ultimate destruction of the 
carrier 
the international association of machinists and aerospace 
workers filed the suit thursday in us district court for the 
district of columbia the union represents eastern mechanics and 
ground workers 
charles bryan president of the machinists local in miami said 
the union will argue that easterns reduction in service benefits 
continental airlines both companies are subsidiaries of texas air 
corp of houston 
this is an act of selfhelp bryan said at a news 
conference its not too different from a lockout quite 
frankly 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the airline has taken 
these actions because theyre in the best interests of the company 
and we expect that the court will agree with us 
easterns cutbacks mean an 114 percent reduction in daily 
flights the financially struggling company said the move would 
permit it to concentrate on serving cities where it is strongest

experts are using computer graphics to explore in 
three dimensions the revolutionary artistic and scientific work of 
italian renaissance genius leonardo da vinci 
the results will be shown in the hayward gallery jan 26april 
16 said rosalie cass an organizer of the exhibition 
if leonardo was around today there is no doubt he would be 
using computers and what we are doing is to show that there was no 
division in his mind between his science and his art miss cass 
said thursday 
she said the exhibition will combine the artistic and scientific 
interests of da vinci and display the greatest range of his 
drawings ever assembled 
unlike photography which records surface patterns of light 
and color computer graphics build realistic threedimensional 
images said philip steadman who is directing the sequences 
leonardos drawings are being plotted into a computer and the 
sequences will make clear to visitors the spatial thinking and 
development in his ideas on architectural projects light in space 
and geometrical bodies he said 
participants will use the technique to analyze the perspective 
of leonardos wall painting the last supper 
the painting of jesus christ portrayed at the moment when he 
tells his disciples that one of them will betray him marks a 
turning point in art it presents questions on perspective that art 
historians and scientists still have not completely solved since 
the work was completed in 1497 
everything comes together in only one spot but that varies 
from different viewpoints and from some positions there appear to 
be different vanishing points miss cass said 
the tempera painting damaged by dampness is on a refectory 
wall in the church of santa maria delle grazie in milan italy 
in his treatise on painting leonardo wrote painting 
encompasses the surfaces colors and forms of anything created by 
nature and philosophy penetrates those same bodies considering 
their properties but is not satisfied with the truth as shown by 
the painter 
steadman said it is striking how many of leonardos remarks 
in his treatise whether on human anatomy optics or the structure 
of plants go well beyond the limits of what is strictly relevant 
to the painters needs and how often a section ends with a remark 
that he will pursue the subject elsewhere in one of his projected 
scientific works 
the exhibition will have 119 drawings 88 of them from the royal 
collection at windsor castle and italian and british models built 
recently from leonardos drawings of mechanical inventions 
they include a construction of his flying machine with a 36foot 
wingspan ball bearings a tank and a multibarreled gun 
leonardo who lived from 1452 to 1519 worked for duke lodovico 
sforza of milan 
he entered the dukes service after writing a celebrated letter 
saying he believed he could give complete satisfaction in 
military engineering constructing buildings and sculpture in 
marble bronze or clay 
in painting i can do as much as anyone whoever he may be 
he wrote

chicagoarea newlyweds who surfaced here after 
dropping out of sight for nearly four months said thursday they 
understand why a lot of people are upset with them but are thankful 
their relatives are forgiving 
what can you say were prodigal children said scott 
swanson 23 referring to the biblical parable of a wayward 
youngster who returns to his family in repentance and is welcomed 
back 
swanson and his bride carolyn swanson 22 were reunited 
wednesday with her parents jim and kathy maclean of haddonfield 
nj the elder macleans flew to san diego after receiving a letter 
from the couple tuesday and talking to them by telephone later that 
night 
we didnt come out thinking we would be welcomed with open 
arms but thats what happened with our families and thats the 
most important thing swanson said we came out really thinking 
that we were going to be scorned for the rest of our lives 
the swansons students at wheaton college in a suburb of 
chicago disappeared april 2 without a word to relatives or friends 
the vanishing act led to fears the couple met with foul play it 
provoked a massive and costly police investigation and search that 
principally involved chicago police but also included law 
enforcements agencies from other states 
the couple said thursday they dont believe they should have to 
make restitution for the police expenditures 
it seems fairly unrealistic for them to try to prosecute us in 
the sense that they want the money back said swanson 
he said he believes its the police rankandfile rather than 
department officials who want to see some kind of payment because 
they feel really gypped 
its like here are some yuppie kids from wheaton college 
they just took off and we have no clues and we didnt know what to 
do and they look silly so they might want to retaliate 
swanson said 
nobody cares its over with said an officer in the chicago 
police departments missing persons bureau who would not give his 
name 
the couple said they intend to remain in san diego and pursue 
their education swanson said he will pursue his goal of going into 
the military reserve and wants to teach while his wife said she 
plans to write books 
the swansons who eloped in late march said their love for each 
other grew while they toiled at jobs at separate delicatessens in 
the upscale beachfront community of la jolla 10 miles north of 
downtown san diego 
the two have been in san diego since shortly after their 
disappearance swanson said wednesday night that they came here 
because they didnt know anyone and no one knew us it has a 
climate that is conducive to living outdoors if we needed to bum it 
for a while

a state college president resigned 
thursday after his use of trust funds for personal expenses came 
under scrutiny and criticism 
i can no longer offer the leadership which the college 
requires and deserves as a result of the intense publicity that 
has come about in the wake of charges of inaccuracy in the 
expenditures of general trust funds westfield state college 
president irving h buchen said in a letter 
college trustees accepted the resignation unanimously after a 
nearly threehour private session which buchen did not attend 
trustees chairman john st clair said there was no settlement 
negotiated with buchen who had been paid 77000 a year 
effective today he is no longer a member of the faculty and 
will receive no benefits except for any accrued vacation time 
st clair said 
its sufficient to say that in a light most favorable to the 
president this could be viewed as careless attention to detail 
poor record keeping and mistakes in judgment relative to the use of 
trust funds which this board finds unacceptable he said 
st clair said the board would have no specific comment on the 
results of its investigation into buchens expense accounts until 
after submitting reports on the findings to the hampden county 
district attorney and a legislative subcommittee investigating the 
use of state college trust funds 
the unionnews of springfield reported that buchen billed 
college trust funds for 3400 in expenses by submitting allegedly 
inaccurate or questionable vouchers for travel and dinners he 
later paid back 1259 
st clair said the trustees will appoint an interim chief 
executive officer within a week in the meantime the board and the 
four college vice presidents will run the 3000student 
institution he said 
buchen 57 has been under fire for his use of college trust 
funds for personal expenses and waiving entrance requirements for 
his 16yearold daughter she attended the college and lived in a 
dormitory during the fall semester last year although she had not 
graduated from high school in january buchen apologized to 
trustees and withdrew her from classes 
buchan had succeeded francis j pilecki who left amid charges 
of sexual misconduct with male students and a furor over a 10000 
payment by trustees to one of the students 
the 150yearold college founded by horace mann was one of the 
first coeducational public teachers colleges in the united states

as sand trickled through an hourglass on 
johnny carsons desk arkansas gov bill clinton admitted to 
tonight show viewers that his comically savaged speech at the 
democratic convention did not go as planned 
my sole goal was achieved however i wanted so badly to make 
dukakis look great and i succeeded beyond my wildest dreams 
said clinton to the laughter and applause of the shows studio 
audience 
clinton delivered the nominating speech for massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis at last weeks democratic national convention in 
atlanta allotted 15 minutes clinton spoke for 32 minutes 
ignoring flashing red lights and other attempts to cut him off 
finally clintons line i want to say in closing drew applause 
carson told the audience in his monologue that clinton was to be 
a guest and added not to worry we have plenty of black coffee 
and extra cots in the lobby 
carson introduced clinton with a satirical longwinded speech 
of his own that included details ranging from the governors 
educational background 
after clinton sat on the couch carson said my first question 
is how are you then turned over the hourglass 
the governor said that while his speech was ridiculed his 
constituents continued to support him he said the speech was a 
good idea that didnt work 
clinton tried a different approach to win over carsons 
audience playing a tenor saxophone with the shows orchestra 
clintons appearance on the carson show was his latest attempt 
to use humor to keep the disastrous speech from ruining his image 
as a rising star in the democratic party the governor who 
previously had a reputation as a good orator began polishing his 
quips in little rock shortly after the convention speech was over 
it wasnt my finest hour went one line it wasnt even my 
finest hour and onehalf 
during a speech this week to about 150 educators clinton had 
trouble with his microphone without skipping a beat he said 
have the networks taken control of the mikes 
on wednesday at the capitol little rock activist and 
restaurateur robert say mcintosh dished up food for anyone 
willing to dish out criticism for the clinton bashers 
diners earned a free meal with lines such as 
bill clinton may be a blabbermouth but hes the best thing to 
happen to arkansas 
i appreciate my governor even if he is boring 
on thursday the arkansas democrat carried clinton and carson in 
its editorial page comic strip spanks 
the first frame shows carson introducing clinton with now 
heres a man who was a miniseries unto himself gone with the 
windbag arkansas talk of the town governor clinton 
clinton appears in the second frame in the image of comedian 
rodney dangerfield saying hey johnny i tell yuh i dont get 
no respect 
the last frame shows clinton finishing his monologue when i 
was speaking at the convention one delegate accidentally hit 
another delegate with his sign 
oh excuse me said the first delegate i hit you with my 
sign 
hit me again said the second delegate i can still hear 
him 
the arkansas gazette on its oped page carried a 13paragraph 
story by a retired newspaper editor who urged clinton not to let tv 
people get under his skin 
if they were all as smart as they sometimes pretend to be 
surely some of them would be out there where the really big money 
is selling red neckties to the people who are on television 
wrote john e pruniski 
clinton first elected governor in 1978 at the age of 32 met 
dukakis while serving as president of the national governors 
association last year and eventually landed a major role in 
dukakis campaign as an adviser and sometime standin clinton who 
at one time flirted with the idea of running for president was 
among those talked of as a possible dukakis running mate

jesse jackson has a winning record in helping 
americans in trouble abroad but he failed to get the support of 
the state department and the democratic and republican presidential 
candidates for a private bid to spring the nine us hostages in 
lebanon 
so jackson is backing off saying no meeting has been set and 
no meeting has been sought for him to negotiate with iranian 
officials 
the best chance for the hostages remains recognition by tehran 
that their confinement by proiranian factions in lebanon is a 
humanitarian issue and not a card to play in foreign policy 
maneuvers 
jackson was quoted as saying on wednesday that he was trying to 
reach the iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati through 
third parties including arab diplomats 
i have continuously expressed my interest in doing whatever i 
could to make a humanitarian appeal to gain release of the 
americans held hostage he told the new york times 
humanitarian appeals always help they penetrate deeper than 
political tradeoffs 
jackson had made the freeing of the hostages a theme in his 
unsuccessful pursuit of the democratic presidential nomination 
like a number of his proposals it has a sweet and simple ring to 
it 
in january 1984 jackson negotiated the release of lt robert o 
goodman jr a navy airman who had been shot down by syrian forces 
in lebanon it was widely seen as an attempt by president hafez 
assad whose government is listed by the state department as a 
supporter of terrorism to boost jacksons political stock 
in june 1984 possibly with similar intentions cuba worked out 
arrangements with jackson in havana for the release of 48 american 
and cuban political prisoners 
despite this winning record jackson was publicly discouraged by 
the state department from trying his hand at personal diplomacy in 
behalf of the hostages in lebanon 
reverend jacksons sentiments concerning the hostages are 
those shared by all americans spokesman charles e redman said 
thursday but as for efforts to release the hostages we believe 
that official channels offer the best chance of success 
redman said he meant working through the us government 
james b steinberg deputy issues director in the presidential 
campaign of michael dukakis also voiced qualified disapproval 
we do not know any of the facts about this matter as a matter of 
general policy gov dukakis has said that he does not favor 
private citizens independently conducting foreign policy 
kitty dukakis the democratic candidates wife said her husband 
would not sanction any attempt by jackson to negotiate for the 
hostages release my husband feels very strongly that 
individuals cant negotiate but governments negotiate with each 
other mrs dukakis said and he would discourage jesse jackson 
from going to iran and trying to do that 
vice president george bush who will receive the republican 
nomination next month in new orleans was more critical of 
jacksons personal diplomacy it shouldnt happen he said 
were talking about very sensitive foreign policy the 
administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the 
united nations we dont need any loose cannons rolling around the 
deck 
the remark stung jackson criticized bush on thursday for 
describing him as a loose cannon but he also appeared to back 
away from the idea of interceding with the iranians 
no meeting has been set and no meeting has been sought 
jackson told the associated press weve simply talked through 
united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who 
did meet with the iranian foreign minister 
traditionally private citizens are discouraged from conducting 
us foreign policy there is even a law against it 
in the case of iran the situation is particularly delicate 
the reagan administration was embarrassed when it tried to gain 
freedom for the hostages by secretly selling missiles to iran 
the state department which did not support the fiasco is 
engaged in a careful campaign of messages and public statements 
designed to draw iran into a direct discussion of the persian gulf 
war the hostages and terrorism 
so far there has been no authorized response from tehran 
they know where to get hold of us redman said 
an offer on tuesday by hojatolislam hashemi rafsanjani the 
speaker of irans parliament to help obtain the release of the 
american captives if the united states returned frozen assets was 
turned down 
no deals marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
promptly retorted 
if iran agrees to talk with the united states the hostages will 
be high on the agenda but the reagan administration does not want 
to appear to be making another deal with tehran 
in the meantime it is seeking release of the hostages through a 
separate diplomatic track 
when it comes to iran and to the hostages a badly burned reagan 
administration prefers proceeding with extreme caution

six israelis on the first diplomatic mission to 
moscow since the kremlin broke diplomatic relations with the jewish 
state in 1967 say they want to review procedures for soviet jews 
who want to leave 
the israeli diplomats planned to pray in moscows central 
synagogue on the jewish sabbath which begins this evening 
officially the israelis came thursday to inspect the embassy 
building on bolshaya ordynka street israel has been paying the 
soviets 100000 a year to rent the building and diplomats from the 
netherlands have been taking care of it 
but the focus of the israelis visit is another role the dutch 
have been performing for the israeli government the processing of 
requests by soviet jews for israeli visas 
meron gordon head of the delegation and a counselor at his 
countrys embassy in rome said his group might meet with prominent 
jewish refuseniks who have been denied permission by soviet 
authorities to leave the country 
from january to june 6017 soviet jews emigrated but only a 
small fraction went to israel last year the soviet union allowed 
8011 jews to emigrate 
four of the diplomats were born in the soviet union gordon left 
in 1957 at the age of 10 
i think you have an expression butterflies in the stomach 
he said at sheremetyevo airport after the group arrived from 
amsterdam the ones i have in my stomach are very big 
gordon said he hopes the visit is the first step in developing 
the process of improving relations between the states of israel and 
the soviet union 
but kremlin officials stress that the visit is not a precursor 
to the restoration of diplomatic relations broken off after israel 
seized lands from egypt jordan and syria during the 1967 middle 
east war 
the soviet visas the delegation received in the netherlands 
entitle them to a twomonth stay in the soviet union 
the kremlin says it wont restore relations until israel 
withdraws from the occupied territories and agrees to an 
international middle east peace conference 
israel insisted the kremlin allow its representatives to visit 
in exchange for permission for a soviet consular delegation to 
visit the jewish state eight soviet diplomats have been in israel 
since last july to survey russian orthodox church property and meet 
with soviet citizens living there

a us drug enforcement official says former 
white house staffer oliver l north suggested in 1984 that 15 
million designated for a drug sting operation be diverted to the 
nicaraguan contras instead 
ron caffrey now in charge of the atlanta office of the drug 
enforcement administration told a house panel thursday the dea 
rejected the idea caffrey said he told north the suggestion would 
have compromised the chief operative in one of the agencys most 
significant undercover operations 
as it turned out according to caffrey and other dea witnesses 
the investigation was compromised anyway and closed prematurely 
several weeks later when details were leaked to the washington 
times 
the hearing was the first in a series by the judiciary 
subcommittee on crime which is trying to learn whether reagan 
administration officials condoned drug smuggling and other criminal 
activities to further its central american policy especially 
winning aid for the contra rebels 
chairman william j hughes dnj said the panel has 
discovered many many instances of persons in or associated with 
elements of our government attempting to convert to divert 
and to subvert the criminal justice process 
north who has been indicted in the separate diversionof 
millions of dollars from the administrations iran arms sales to 
the contras figured prominently in thursdays testimony 
the testimony focused on a 1984 sting operation in which dea 
used convicted drug pilot barry seal to make contact with the 
colombian cocaine cartel then operating in nicaragua and a 
purported nicaraguan government official federico vaughn 
hughes later said the committee has doubts about whether vaughn 
was in fact part of the government 
nonetheless four dea witnesses said north was interested in 
exposing an alleged involvement of the marxist nicaraguan 
government in drug smuggling so the reagan administration could 
win an upcoming congressional vote on contra aid 
caffrey who was in charge of the dea cocaine desk in 1984 said 
he briefed north on the undercover operation in late june or early 
july 1984 after barry seal had brought cocaine back from nicaragua 
to the united states 
seal at the time was functioning as a dea operative hoping his 
cooperation would bring him a lenient sentence 
caffrey said he told north that the dea planned to send seal 
back to nicaragua to make a 15 million payment for the drugs he 
brought back with the money to be split between the colombia drug 
kingpins in nicaragua and nicaraguan officials 
col north asked why we couldnt land the plane outside 
managua and turn the money over to the contras caffrey said 
the dea official said he responded that such a plan would 
jeopardize seal who had won the trust of the colombian drug cartel 
and of vaughn identified by the dea witnesses as an official of 
the nicaraguan interior ministry 
most of the hearing centered on the news leak to the washington 
times which published its story on the seal operation july 17 
1984 seal then became a government witness rather than an 
operative but was machinegunned to death in early 1986 after 
declining federal protection 
caffrey said when he briefed north on the operation before the 
story was leaked the thennational security council staffer 
asked when the operation could go public 
he added that north did indicate to me there was a vote coming 
up on an appropriation bill to aid the contras i told him public 
disclosure would come from the us attorney or the attorney 
general but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation 
and did not want to compromise it 
ernst jacobsen the dea undercover agent who directed seal said 
that following the leak i heard from my superiors the leak came 
from an aide in the white house still an undercover agent 
jacobsen testified from behind a screen 
a former top dea official exassistant administrator frank 
monastero testified i thought the leak came from the white 
house because of the contra vote that was coming up 
monastero told the subcommittee that the day the news story 
appeared an irate north called him to deny that he was responsible 
for the leak north he said accused the dea of telling a reporter 
that north was the source of the information 
he called to say he did not leak the information and the proof 
was the facts in the story were not accurate monastero said 
my response was thats the standard way to cover your tracks 
i didnt accept that 
pages from norths diary released by the subcommittee show the 
former white house staffer made frequent references to the drug 
operation in the weeks before the leak 
and the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the 
investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a nicaraguan airstrip 
jacobsen said that shortly before the leak a cia agent in miami 
told him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news 
media to suggest sandinista involvement in drug smuggling

a federal judge has upheld a reagan 
administration program of drug testing for air traffic controllers 
saying they have the lives of thousands of people in their 
hands 
us district judge john vukasins ruling was the first in favor 
of a drug testing program by a judge in the federal court here 
where labor groups have filed most of their suits attacking the 
administrations plans for urine testing of federal employees 
an appeal of the ruling is expected 
another federal judge in san francisco has struck down a testing 
program for all federal prison workers and the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals which covers california and eight other western 
states has ruled against mandatory testing of railroad crews after 
accidents and rule violations the latter decision has been 
accepted for review by the us supreme court 
vukasin announced his ruling july 19 but has not yet issued it 
in written form a transcript of his comments was made available to 
reporters thursday 
the lawsuit like those against other drug programs contended 
random drug testing is unconstitutional because it is not based on 
individual suspicion of impairment from current drug use the suit 
also argued that drug testing was unreliable and would be 
ineffective in promoting safety 
the judge said he was unimpressed by statistics showing that 
less than 1 percent of air traffic controllers had shown signs of 
drug use in testing so far 
we are talking here about air traffic controllers who have the 
lives of thousands of people in their hands vukasin said 
in response to arguments that drug testing doesnt show whether 
an employee is currently impaired or under the influence vukasin 
said unfortunately the state of the art has not reached that 
level but that is not an argument of why what at least is 
available to the federal aviation administration should not be 
exercised and utilized 
apparently referring to the ruling on railroad workers he said 
he may be failing to follow precedents but if so it is not done 
out of disrespect

no major adjustments because of this years 
drought are in the works for the agriculture departments 1989 
wheat acreage program 
winter wheat producers soon will be planting next years crop 
and the nochange announcement thursday by agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng helps clear the way all they need now is rain 
as it stands now wheat farmers will have to idle 10 percent of 
their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price supports 
the same as announced last spring 
the 10 percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on 
may 25 under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the 
following years crop prior to june 1 that was before the drought 
became so widespread and severe 
even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production 
especially that of spring wheat the prospective supplydemand 
balance for the coming year does not call for a change in the 
previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989 
lyng who was out of town said in a statement 
a crop projection issued on july 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at 
184 billion bushels down from 212 billion bushels forecast in 
june the 1987 harvest was about 21 billion bushels 
but us wheat inventories have been large despite a heavy 
export drain and totaled around 127 billion bushels on june 1 
the beginning of the 198889 wheat marketing year the smaller 
harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to 
around 666 million bushels by june 1 1989 according to the 
projections 
earlier the june 1 1989 wheat carryover was forecast at 781 
million bushels 
winter wheat which comprises about threefourths of the us 
total will be planted this fall for harvest next year spring 
wheat including durum used for pasta is produced farther north 
and bore the brunt of this summers drought damage to the wheat 
crop 
in a related development officials served notice that wheat 
export subsidies are continuing despite the drought and reduction 
in wheat supplies 
melvin e sims general manager for the departments foreign 
agricultural service said china has bought an additional 400000 
metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
the sales equal to about 147 million bushels were handled by 
two companies cargill inc 200000 tons and ferruzzi usa inc 
200000 tons 
sims said the sales were part of an authorized 2 million tons of 
wheat announced april 5 under the export enhancement program or 
eep and some left over from an earlier authorization 
although no selling prices or other details were announced 
recent wheat prices at farm points have averaged around 346 per 
bushel indicating a us farm value of about 50 million 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
prior to the new authorization on april 5 china had bought 49 
million tons of wheat under eep subsidy arrangements sims said 
china has 610000 tons still available for use 
under the program exporters can sell us commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the four companies averaged 984 per 
ton of wheat or about 27 cents a bushel the bonuses will be paid 
in the form of surplus commodities owned by the departments 
commodity credit corp

drought may be gnawing at the bank accounts of 
many farmers but the hot dry weather isnt expected to cut back 
on their spending for many production items this year according to 
an agriculture department report 
the drought is expected to have little impact on 1988 
expenditures for seed fertilizer and pesticides because most of 
these were applied at or before planting the report by the 
departments economic research service said thursday farm 
machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in 1988 but 
could be slowed by the drought 
spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be 
affected significantly by the drought however 
energy expenditures for irrigation will be up but likely will 
be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and 
drying the report said a grim reminder that reduced yields or 
none at all mean it will cost less to run grain combines and 
dryers 
spending on farm machinery increased 12 billion to 58 
billion in 1987 ending seven years of decline the report said 
net cash income of farmers the difference between gross cash 
receipts and cash expenses rose to a record 56 billion in 
calendar 1987 current usda forecasts put 1988 net cash income at 
53 billion to 59 billion

the us labor department is putting the 
finishing touches on an emergency aid package for thousands of 
migrant workers stranded in the droughtparched midwest a 
department spokesman said 
labor department spokesman bob zachariasiewicz said thursday the 
agency has a plan of action but it wont be unveiled until 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin who is overseas gives it her final 
approval an announcement is likely next week 
a source said the package would total 4 million to 5 million 
but the final distribution is just not set on paper yet 
the package follows appeals by rep albert bustamante dtexas 
for assistance to migrant and seasonal workers who were unable to 
earn a living this summer because of the drought 
in his letter to mrs mclaughlin bustamante said migrant 
workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested 
their personal savings to search for field work drought conditions 
have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their 
financial losses 
because the presidents emergency relief program is directed 
solely at the farmer level migrant workers and their families have 
no safety net to relieve their conditions measures taken to date 
have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks 
bustamante a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and 
grandson of mexicanamericans who followed the crops said he still 
has relatives who travel from texas to minnesota to harvest sugar 
beets 
bustamante estimates the stranded migrant and seasonal worker 
population at about 10000 but said it is difficult to get a true 
figure because they dont have a high profile theyre not a 
voting bloc like some others that make a lot of noise 
exhausted of their personal financial resources they have no 
money for temporary shelter and food he wrote many would like 
to return home but they cannot they are broke indebted stranded 
and dependent on the kindness and charity of local efforts 
he said he is seeking funds to provide shelter food and 
jobsearch assistance to migrants who want to stay in the midwest 
to help farmers salvage crops and to give others who want to 
return home money for travel 
bustamante also sent his appeal to president reagan agriculture 
secretary richard lyng and texas gov bill clements

senators are using the closing weeks of the 
100th congress to put the issue of global warming from the 
greenhouse effect at the top of their environmental agenda for 
next year 
they got the ball rolling this week with the introduction of 
legislation prompted by a series of hearings over the last two 
years at which scientists warned that the greenhouse effect 
threatens the planet with higher temperatures climate changes and 
rising oceans in the next century 
sixteen senators including energy committee chairman bennett 
johnston dla unveiled a comprehensive plan on thursday that 
calls for a variety of steps from developing safer nuclear power 
to slowing the destruction of forests in the third world 
a day earlier a group headed by robert stafford rvt 
submitted a package to end us use of chlorofluorocarbons the 
chemicals that contribute to global warming and destroy the earths 
vital ozone layer 
johnston who has been identified more with energy development 
and production than environmental protection said he would hold a 
series of hearings in coming weeks to set the stage for 1989 
next year he said at a news conference well have to begin 
the serious process of legislating well act as fast as the 
publics willing to support us 
johnston is a cosponsor of most elements in a package developed 
by sen tim wirth dcolo that represents the broadest capitol 
hill response yet to the greenhouse warnings 
the greenhouse effect is the most significant economic 
political environmental and human problem facing the 21st 
century wirth said 
johnston who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect 
said the evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable it 
is so much more comprehensive dangerous and lifechanging than 
anything weve ever seen 
aides said johnston has become convinced that global action is 
necessary to combat the production of carbon and other gases that 
scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere 
johnston stopped short of endorsing a key element of wirths 
proposal reducing carbon monoxide emissions by requiring new car 
fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010 a doubling of the 
1985 fuel efficiency standard 
the wirth package would force this country to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000 scientists estimate that 
carbon dioxide coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion produces 
about half the worlds greenhouse gases the united states is said 
to be responsible for 20 percent of the worlds carbon dioxide 
emissions 
the proposal would require administration officials to draft a 
national energy plan emphasizing the least expensive ways to reduce 
fossil fuel use and increase use of renewables such as solar energy 
the package would authorize about 1 billion through 1992 for 
research and development of nonfossil energy sources and a new 
generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors it also calls for 
greater reliance on cleanerburning natural gas for heating and 
transportation 
on the international front the secretary of state would be 
urged to hold a meeting aimed at getting other nations to commit to 
a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production by 2015 
the legislation also would authorize this country to spend more 
than 15 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control 
information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in 
burgeoning nations 
it also calls for the united states to work through 
international lending and development agencies to slow the 
destruction of forests which consume carbon dioxide when alive but 
which emit huge amounts when they are cut down 
johnston said that to slow down polluting development in the 
third world were going to have to pay for their nondevelopment 
in some way and its going to be expensive 
joining as cosponsors were max baucus dmont jeff bingaman 
dnm dale bumpers dark john chafee rri john danforth 
rmo wyche fowler dga albert gore dtenn john heinz

advocates of a proposed memorial to honor 
black revolutionary war soldiers are concentrating on a design now 
that two federal commissions have approved its location on the 
national mall 
the fine arts commission and the national capital planning 
commission on thursday approved plans to build the memorial in 
constitution gardens a grasy area close to the reflecting pool 
between the lincoln memorial and washington monument 
the two panels also voted at separate meetings to approve a 
plan to build a memorial honoring women in military service at the 
entrance of the arlington cemetery 
advocates for both projects next must develop designs and win 
another round of approvals from the two panels and the national 
capital memorial commission which approved the siting plans last 
month 
marshall e purnell executive vice president of devrouax amp 
purnell one of three architectural firms involved with the 
project said designers will meet with memorial supporters to get 
a feel for what they think it should look like 
the designers will then draft plans to present to the memorials 
foundation by early next year if approved the design will be 
presented to the three agencies for their approval purnell 
estimated the project would be completed in about 2 years 
private donations are expected to pay for the project estimated 
at 4 million

a 66millionyearold rock deposit in a texas 
creek bed shows that the area was once smashed by a massive ocean 
wave perhaps triggered by a large comet or asteroid that hit the 
atlantic ocean according to a study published today in the journal 
science 
thor a hansen a geologist at western washington university 
said he and another researcher found evidence that a wave perhaps 
as tall as 300 feet scoured the floor of a primitive gulf of 
mexico picked up sand and shark teeth then dumped the material in 
what now is in a bed of a tributary to the brazos river in central 
texas 
it the wave was so big we think the circumstantial evidence 
is very strong that it was caused by a bolide meteorite impact 
said hansen 
the deposit he said was found in what is called the 
cretaceoustertiary boundary this is the name given a geologic 
formation that other researchers have identified as having been 
created during a time that meteorites were showering earth about 
66 million years ago 
hansen said the formation he found in the texas creek bed is 
rich in iridium an element that is common in meteorites but rare 
on earth it is considered a universal mark of the 
cretaceoustertiary called kt boundary 
at the time that the wave was created hansen said texas and the 
whole gulf coast area looked far different than now the waters of 
the ocean were much higher and the coast was much farther inland 
hansen said the massive wave churned against the ocean floor 
moving huge clay boulders picking up sand limestone and shark 
teeth and leaving a path of great erosion 
when the waters settled down the debris was deposited again on 
the ocean floor leaving a mark of the violence that occurred over 
many centuries the sea water receded dry land emerged and now the 
deposit left by the wave is seen in the wall of a creek bed in 
falls county in central texas 
the thing that is remarkable about this deposit is that it was 
produced far offshore on a quiet water shelf said hansen 
above and below is just mud quiet water sedimentation theres 
no evidence of any disturbance at all yet in the middle of that 
there is this quite large unit 
based on the force required to move the material left in the 
deposit hansen said he calculated that the wave had to be 150 to 
300 feet high 
circumstantial evidence he said leads to the theory that a 
meteorite striking the ocean caused the wave because there is no 
geologic evidence suggesting that a volcano or an earthquake could 
have triggered the wave 
there was no volcanic activity nearby at the time he said 
also we find no volcanic ash in the formation 
the only other thing that could have created such a large wave 
of this type said hansen is a meteorite about six miles in 
diameter that probably struck the west central atlantic ocean 
other researchers he said have found kt formations in 
arkansas haiti mexico and offshore from north carolina all of 
these said hansen help support the idea that a boulder from space 
swamped texas with a splash some 66 million years ago 
coinvestigators with hansen in the study were joanne bourgeois 
and patricia wiberg of the university of washington seattle and 
e g kauffman of the university of colorado boulder colo

researchers have long known that the aids 
virus can kill the diseasefighting tcells in the body but 
research published today shows that the virus can also destroy the 
immune system simply by disrupting the inner mechanism of these 
cells 
in a study published today in science a group of researchers 
said they have found that the aids virus is able to block a 
function of a key molecule in tcells and prevent the immune 
response from taking place 
robert j hartzman of the naval medical research institute in 
bethesda md said he and his coresearchers made the finding by 
comparing the response of tcells that were infected with the aids 
virus with tcells that were uninfected 
normally tcells respond to an antigen by binding to it and 
then starting a process that leads to the production of antibodies 
part of this process is a signal by a molecule called the cd3 
receptor which is on the outside of the tcell this signal crosses 
the cell wall and triggers production of calcium within the cell 
this calcium then leads to the next step in producing an antibody 
against the disease 
hartzman said the study showed that in tcells infected with 
hiv1 which is an aids virus the ability of the cd3 receptor to 
release calcium is blocked or retarded 
this is a mechanism that can disrupt the immune response 
said hartzman we knew that hiv can kill tcells now this shows 
that it can also reduce the qualitative response of those cells 
the study was conducted using tcells from healthy donors part 
of the cells were infected with hiv and the rest were not the 
cells were cultured for 60 days and then exposed to a antibody that 
would mimic the early response to an antigen 
in the uninfected cells the cd3 took the normal next step by 
releasing calcium into the interior of the cell the tcells 
infected with hiv however did not release the calcium which 
stopped the immune response 
marvin reitz a researcher in an aids laboratory at the national

a us interagency team is meeting daily in 
washington to plan for what is expected to be one of the largest 
refugee migrations in this century the return of exiled afghans to 
their homeland 
the refugees are expected to include some 3 million in pakistan 
and another 22 million exiled in iran there are also between 1 
million and 3 million afghans still inside their country but who 
have been displaced by the antisoviet guerrilla war 
as part of the repatriation planning the united states is 
pressing the soviet union for maps showing the locations of land 
mines scattered by soviet troops throughout afghanistan a top 
state department official said thursday 
at the same time pakistans foreign minister in a meeting with 
secretary of state george shultz allayed concerns that the soviet 
union was reneging on its timetable for withdrawing troops from 
afghanistan this impression has just been dispelled sahabzada 
yaqub khan said 
shultz defense secretary frank carlucci and yaqub khan are 
comparing notes on how to monitor the soviet withdrawal and on 
afghanistans future after the troops are gone 
one of the immediate problems is the land mines a team of 
defense department experts recently visited pakistan to assess the 
extent of the mine problem across the border in afghanistan said a 
senior official involved in the refugee repatriation effort the 
official asked not to be identified 
the official said the pentagon team recommended that afghan 
refugees be taught how to recognize mines so they do not 
inadvertently step on them and that some of them be trained to 
deactivate the explosive devices 
they have to be trained in mine awareness theyll have to 
live with it for decades he said 
some refugees returning to the town of barikot stepped on mines 
in recent weeks and word of the danger spread among the refugee 
camps in pakistan 
us officials say it is difficult to determine just how many 
mines are strewn around the rugged afghan countryside because many 
of the devices were dropped out of helicopters rather than 
methodically sown estimates vary from 5 million to 30 million 
were telling them the soviets that theyre responsible for 
the devastation and the least they can do is help with maps 
said the state department official the soviets have said they 
removed most of the mines and that the remaining ones were planted 
by the usbacked guerrillas fighting the soviets 
thats just false the us official said

a consumer group says it will sue the consumer 
product safety commission if it doesnt do something about what the 
group sees as the threat of cancer lurking in childrens sand piles 
a commission officials said thursday there is no evidence that 
commercial play sand causes cancer but the commission will make a 
formal decision on a petition to ban limestone products including 
play sand in september 
industry officials say if sand from the nations rock quarries 
caused cancer there would be higher instances of the disease among 
workers in the centuriesold industry 
public citizen a nonprofit organization which fights for 
product safety and public health said in a news release thursday 
that many of the nations children could be exposed to play sand 
that contains dangerous asbestos or asbestoslike tremolite fibers 
during the hot summer of 1988 your children may be playing in 
the sandbox would you want them to be breathing asbestos as they 
pour buckets of sand over each other the consumer group asked 
asbestos fibers have been proven to cause cancer when inhaled 
children who are exposed to them may not be afflicted until many 
years after exposure the group said 
in a letter to the product safety commission public citizen 
said that if the agency does not indicate within 30 days that it 
plans to resolve the issue the group will consider legal action 
appeals to the safety commission to protect workers and 
consumers from exposure to rockbased fibers date back 12 years in 
may the agency said it had evaluated several play sand samples and 
did not find asbestos in any of them 
public citizen however said sand sold under two brand names 
basins play sand and quickrete kiddies fun sand have been shown 
by tests to contain tremolite a rockforming mineral that can 
occur in an asbestos form 
no one knows how many other brands may be similarly 
contaminated the group said 
an official of package pavement of stormville ny a 
distributor of kiddies fun sand said five outside tests have been 
conducted on its sand and none found harmful ingredients 
all indications are that there is no such fiber in our play 
sand said eileen doherty vice president for marketing she said 
sand from a quarry in connecticut does contain tremolite but in a 
crystalline form which is not harmful 
sandra eberle safety commission program manager for chemical 
hazards said no one has found true asbestos in play sand she said 
the fiberlike particles that have raised concern are not tremolite 
asbestos but ultrathin cleavages from crystalline tremolite that 
occur in some marblebased sand 
its very upsetting to us because parents get naturally 
terrified ive spent a lot of time on the phone telling people 
this is not asbestos she said 
ms eberle said however that the commission is still 
considering a petition by new jersey geologist and physician mark 
germine to ban all limestone products including play sand lawn 
and garden limestone and consumer gravel products 
rick renninger of the national stone association which 
represents the industry said the claim of cancercausing 
ingredients in sand is old and is not backed up by the evidence 
we produce a billion tons of stone a year in the united 
states and weve been doing it for a couple of hundred years he 
said i think that thered be evidence of asbestos disease 
problems in people exposed for their entire working lives and 
there simply isnt 
renninger said tremolite is among the most common rockforming 
minerals and is found in almost every rock product 
public citizen researcher dr lynn silver a pediatrician 
accused sand distributors of trying to hide the danger of their 
products 
the industry throws up a smokescreen she said in an 
interview if somebody dies from falling off the left side of a 
skyscraper they tell you theres nothing to prove that falling off 
the right side is also dangerous

texas sen lloyd bentsen is seasoning his 
western campaign with a democratic version of the sagebrush 
rebellion that helped sweep the republicans into the white house 
eight years ago 
ronald reagan capitalized on the independent spirit of the west 
by promising to get government off the backs of the people 
bentsen campaigning for the vice presidency as michael dukakis 
running mate sounded a lot like reagan in a speech in reno nev 
on thursday 
if there is one lesson we have learned in recent years it is 
that the federal government cant solve all of the nations 
problems bentsen said 
but he said trying to make that compatible with dukakis 
promise of an activist government washington can lead 
bentsen promised the convention of the national conference of 
state legislators that a dukakisbentsen administration would not 
be imperial and overbearing he said dukakis as a governor 
understood that problem and he as a texan understood the west 
i think what you see in a candidate like myself one from a 
state like texas which shares a lot of the western concerns and 
objectives is someone who can converse on the problems with an 
experience and background that has compatibility he told 
reporters 
by putting him on the ticket bentsen said dukakis was saying 
to democrats who went and voted for reagan come home theres a 
place for you in this party 
dukakis he said would see that westerners were very much a 
part of the administration and in highly responsible positions 
bentsen said adding that he would push for that also 
the democratic ticket lost all but minnesota and the district of 
columbia four years ago although no schedule has yet been made 
the dukakis campaign plans to use bentsen as a tool to lure back 
not only his native texas but also the southwest south and 
california 
bentsen began his first solo tour as the vice presidential 
nominee wenesday in new mexico and campaigned on thursday in san 
francisco prior to his reno trip he planned to visit a child care 
center in los angeles today before heading to a rally in amarillo 
texas dukakis meanwhile was on a campaign swing through the 
midwest 
the two men made a joint campaign trip immediately following 
last weeks democratic national convention with stops in texas 
california north dakota missouri and pennsylvania 
in san francisco on thursday bentsen asked for union support of 
the ticket at a convention of the united food and commercial 
workers 
bentsen got cheers from the crowed of 3500 when he cited his 
senate record including this years big fight with the reagan 
administration over the trade bill and the sixtydays notice for 
plant closings 
bentsen said he expected congress would be able to override the 
president if he vetoes those bills earlier this year when the two 
measures were in a single package reagans veto was sustained

documents disclosing details of the massive 
defense department contract fraud inquiry will remain secret a 
federal judge ruled thursday rejecting bids by news organizations 
to make the information public 
the los angeles times and copley newspapers attorneys said they 
will appeal the ruling to the 9th us circuit court of appeal 
us district judge david kenyon accepted a government argument 
that unsealing search warrants and their accompanying affidavits 
might hinder completion of the wideranging fraud investigation 
the court does not wish to minimize the importance of the role 
of the press especially in matters of extreme public interest such 
as the investigation concerned herein said kenyon 
however the court finds that on balance the publics 
interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly 
outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant 
affidavits at this time he said 
the documents in question detail searches conducted june 14 at 
northrop corp teledyne electronics litton industries and the 
home of defense consultant fred lackner the only segments released 
by the government were introductions showing that wiretaps had been 
used 
the massive government probe which became public last month 
centers on allegations that defense industry consultants bribed 
pentagon officials for information that helped contractors win 
multimilliondollar contracts 
kenyon overruled an earlier decision by us magistrate joseph 
reichmann who held that the public had a right to know details of 
such an investigation which affects operation of the us 
government 
us district judge tf gilroy daly in bridgeport conn 
thursday also denied a newspapers request to unseal documents that 
are part of the investigation 
there is a right under the first amendment of access to court 
documents daly said in denying the hartford courants motion 
that the affidavits used to gain search warrants for norden 
systems offices be unsealed but at this early stage the right 
is a qualified and limited one 
norden is a subsidiary of hartfordbased united technologies 
corp it is suspected of benefitting from inside information to 
build a battlefield communication system for the marines according 
to other documents already released in the investigation

president reagan praised a child care proposal 
by vice president george bush calling it a means of allowing women 
to choose to stay home with their children if they want 
reagan told a group of evangelical young people thursday the 
plan would strengthen the family because the basic idea here 
is that the government would simply let families keep up to 1000 
more of their own money 
thats money the family itself can decide how to spend 
reagan said working mothers could put the money toward child 
care but by giving each family this tax credit the vice 
presidents plan would also permit thousands of mothers to choose 
to stay home with their children 
it was reagans first comment on the proposal which bush is 
making part of his own presidential campaign 
in the speech to the student congress on evangelism at the 
washington convention center reagan also reiterated his opposition 
to abortion saying we cannot proclaim the noble ideal that 
human life is sacred then turn our backs on the taking of some 
4000 unborn childrens lives every day 
this must stop the president said an abortion is the 
taking of a human life 
many who seek abortions do so in harrowing circumstances he 
added and just as tolerance means accepting that many in good 
faith hold views different from our own it also means that no man 
or woman should sit in judgment on another 
i believe and vice president bush believes with me that we 
must rise above bitterness and reproach to find positive answers to 
the tragedy of abortion 
reagan said his administration has sought to reflect a return 
to basic values through such steps as the enactment by congress 
of the equal access act of 1984 giving voluntary religious groups 
the right to meet after school on the same basis as other groups 
he also cited longstanding administration positions in support of 
returning prayer to the classroom and reversing the supreme court 
decision that legalized abortions 
he said legislation his administration has submitted to deal 
with child pornography is being held up in congress and asked 
if the house and senate leadership really care about family 
values isnt it time they brought this antipornography 
legislation to a vote 
he also talked to the young men and women about the pressures 
teenagers feel to have sex out of wedlock 
im sure that each of you believes that someday youll find 
someone to fall in love with and you will he said you know 
that when you meet that person and meet in a marriage that you 
will be true to each other well did you ever stop to think you 
can start being true to that one special person beginning now 
the 8000 young people cheered wildly applauded stamped their 
feet and jumped up and down as the president made his appearance in 
the cavernous hall 
he opened by leading the group in the pledge of allegiance to 
the american flag and ended by joining others in the crowd in 
waving a small flashlight in an effort to keep time to the music as 
the group sang a song proclaiming we will carry the torch of the 
lord

arraignments are scheduled for next week 
for six libyans and two other arab nationals charged with plotting 
to use libyan government money to recruit dissident support in the 
united states 
the eight were indicted by a federal grand jury on thursday and 
are scheduled to be arraigned aug 5 
the 40count indictment did not make any mention of previous 
accusations that one of the defendants mousa hawamda took part in 
a plot to assassinate a senior us official the target of the 
alleged plot has been identified as oliver north who helped plan 
the 1986 aerial bombing of libya 
hawamda a washington travel agency owner was charged with 
asking another defendant adel sennosi to gather personal 
information about a highranking government official for the 
revolutionary committee in libya which is an intelligence agency 
all eight who were arrested last week by the fbi following a 
yearlong probe are charged with laundering money and violating the 
1986 libyan sanctions regulations which prohibit travel to and 
transactions with libya 
in a related development us district court judge james 
cacheris ordered two leaders of the american indian movement jailed 
until they agree to testify before the grand jury that is 
continuing its investigation into the libyan case 
the two vernon bellecourt and william means were promised 
immunity from prosecution but refused to testify in protest over 
the governments wire tapping of their phones and what they said 
were other violations of their rights 
bellecourt of the white earth chippewa nation from northern 
minnesota said he visited libya several times and was one of the 
organizers of a 1987 rally in tripoli marking the first anniversary 
of the us bombing 
the case against the eight arabs accuses them of violating a 
special license granted by the treasury department that allows 
libya to send money for its estimated 250 students in the united 
states 
the peoples committee for libyan students which administers 
the money allegedly used it to organize support among american 
indians and black moslems including travel to libya and 
antiamerican demonstrations in washington 
the indictment charges that the pcls was used to further 
revolutionary policy by recruiting and funding members of 
selected american groups and by gathering intelligence 
information 
hawamda who is a naturalized american with jordanian 
citizenship allegedly used his manara travel agency in downtown 
washington to supply false billings and make travel arrangements 
for the indians 
seven of the defendants were accused of being libyan agents 
masquerading as students in the united states the eighth manhal 
ben mohamed is a moroccan employee at manara and hawamdas 
brotherinlaw 
the other defendants are saleh alrajhi salem omar zubeidy 
milad shibani mahdi abousetta ramadan belgasem and adel sennosi 
all six libyans are current or former officers of the pcls

a clenched fist thrust inside a star of david 
is their insignia a symbol of their anger and their allegiance 
loaded guns and lengthy arrest records represent their 
willingness to express both 
the arabs are more afraid of us than the police says shmuel 
herman an immigrant to israel from elizabeth nj we have a 
freer hand 
herman is a member of the committee for safe roads an innocuous 
name for a militant group whose armed patrols in arab sectors of 
jerusalem have stirred emotions in this divided city 
the group is made up of followers of americanborn rabbi meir 
kahane and his kach movement which advocates expelling all arabs 
from israelicontrolled territory 
they patrol in vans and on foot in defiance of police who have 
arrested 20 of the vigilantes in six days some officials fear the 
group will provoke violence between the holy citys 135000 
palestinians and 340000 jews 
they are absolutely irresponsible elements and one has to do 
everything to stop them mayor teddy kollek said on israel radio 
this week 
on one patrol thursday four men whose ages range from 16 to 24 
drove through arab east jerusalem to the jewish community of neve 
yaacov and escorted bus no 25 often a target of arab stoning 
attacks to the center of the city 
shmuel ben yishai organizer of the patrols said many jews 
appreciate the efforts of his committee he was among those 
detained and warned by police but he said that if he catches a 
palestinian stonethrower i will break his arm 
all 20 of those detained were freed on bail of up to 3750 
after being charged with incitement and most are patroling again 
on thursday the van drove slowly past mosques palestinian 
restaurants stores and homes in east jerusalem the four men 
looked out the windows a 9mm handgun rested on the dashboard 
as it passed three arab workers eating lunch beneath a tree 
22yearold shmuel dayan formerly of minneapolis minn shouted 
were from kahane 
herman also one of the men arrested says the volunteer patrols 
literally look for trouble 
we keep our eyes open for some suspiciouslooking arab 
someone who looks around like a thief in america then we drive 
back and forth if we catch them trying to hurt an israeli we 
rough them up sometimes we put them in the trunk of the car and 
take them to the police 
herman 24 said the committee has about 100 volunteers in 
jerusalem 80 in the west bank and 60 in haifa the northern port 
city 
they saw no suspicious palestinians on thursdays hourlong 
patrol however 
its a shame i wanted to see some action herman said 
kahanes supporters began citizen convoys in march 1987 
generally in the occupied west bank where most of them live as 
settlers and began patrolling jerusalem last week 
arab east jerusalem which israel captured in the 1967 war and 
has annexed has become a focal point of the rebellion against 
israeli rule in the occupied territories 
since the uprising began dec 8 among the 15 million 
palestinians of the west bank and gaza strip more than 230 
palestinians and four israelis have been killed 
the road committees symbol the fist inside a star of david 
illustrates its philosophy that jews must be tough to survive even 
in israel 
supporters of kach hope the image of a protector of jews will 
help in novembers election kahane now is its only representative 
in the knesset israels parliament 
like most kahane supporters herman believe peace with the arabs 
is not possible because they dont want it 
dayan said he is prepared for violence 
we werent put on this earth to live happily and peacefully 
he said we were put here to study the bible and to hold on to 
our land

a garden snake that startled a 
onelegged man triggered a series of events that left his car and 
house in flames 
the 3foot nonpoisonous snake was napping under the front seat 
of al fitzwaters car but awoke when the fort wayne man climbed 
behind the wheel thursday to test the engine hed been repairing 
the snake bit me on the ankle said fitzwater 45 who lost 
his right leg in a hanggliding accident in 1975 i started 
stomping it and hit the gas and then the car lunged forward 
the car accelerated into the rear of fitzwaters house spilling 
a can of gas that was open on its bumper and causing flames to 
shoot out of the open carburetor 
the ensuing blaze quickly enveloped the front of fitzwaters car 
and leaped to his home 
i was lucky fitzwater said the car started again and i 
backed it away then got out 
a passerby notified the fort wayne fire department which 
brought the blaze under control about 30 minutes after it began 
while firefighters fought to smother the last of the flames the 
snake was still curled inside the front seat of the abandoned car 
next to a fire truck parked in front of his home fitzwater sat in 
his wheelchair watching the smoke and shaking his head 
incredulously 
i cant believe that damn things still alive

two cabinet ministers joined a third 
colleague and quit in a growing dispute over the nations proposed 
constitution a presidential aide said 
culture minister celso furtado and science and technology 
minister luiz henrique da silveira handed in their resignations 
thursday said a presidential aide who spoke on condition of 
anonymity he said he did not know why they had resigned 
renato archer the social welfare minister quit wednesday 
the resignations came after president jose sarney on tuesday 
attacked the constitution proposed by lawmakers after 18 months of 
work as chaotic he said it could make brazil impossible to 
govern 
despite sarneys broadcast legislators overwhelmingly approved 
the rough draft of the new constitution late wednesday 
the document includes proposals to limit annual interest rates 
to 12 percent to give brazilians control of all mining operations 
to cut the voting age from 18 to 16 and to grant the unrestricted 
right to strike and a sixhour work day 
 
the three ministers resignations deepened a split between the 
president and ulysses guimaraes the powerful speaker of the house 
of representatives and president of the 559member constitutional 
assembly 
all three ministers are close personal friends of guimaraes who 
responded to sarneys criticisms with a sharplyworded defense of 
the assemblys work 
tuesdays broadcast was sarneys lastditch attempt to remove 
several proposals from the new document that will replace a 1969 
constitution handed down by military generals the military has 
raised objections to the constitution 
lawmakers now can amend the document in a second round of voting 
expected to end in september 
agrarian reform minister jader barbalho will be the new social 
welfare minister the presidential spokesman said education 
minister hugo napoleao will head the culture ministry and the 
technology ministry will be headed by luiz rico vicente

the fire that destroyed the 
home of imprisoned black leader nelson mandela was prompted by a 
dispute between black teenage groups and was not aimed at mandela 
himself sources said 
police said as many as 50 black high school students stoned the 
house doused it with gasoline and set it ablaze thursday no one 
was hurt and no arrests were made they said 
neighbors and black journalists speaking on condition of 
anonymity said some attackers wore jackets of daliwonga high 
school in soweto and were involved in a dispute wednesday with 
young blacks who guard the home 
mandelas wife winnie a prominent antiapartheid activist was 
bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned 
of the fire her daughter zindzi 27 and her two grandchildren 
who also live at the fourroom home were away at the time 
state of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest 
security force action treatment of detainees some forms of 
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches said leaders in soweto and other black 
townships had been asked to call upon the community not to act 
emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a 
spiral of violence 
he leaders would try to talk to the principal and the students 
of the school involved to ease the situation he said young men who 
congregate around the mandela home were told not to act without 
thinking or with revenge 
mrs mandela arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the 
blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the 
car she then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts 
social welfare projects 
youths who guarded the house some wearing jackets of the 
mandela united soccer club sponsored by the family pushed 
journalists away from the office one threatened to burn a 
photographers car 
later attorney amrichand soma told reporters mandela was 
reached at pollsmoor prison in cape town where he is serving a 
life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
whitedominated government and said no statement should be made 
for mrs mandela the fire was one of many hardships since her 
husband a leader of the outlawed african national congress was 
jailed in 1962 mandela 70 received a life sentence in 1964 after 
being convicted of plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the 
whiteled government 
mrs mandela 54 has spent 17 months in solitary confinement 
lived in isolation been arrested several times and passed 
virtually her entire adult life under stringent police restrictions 
and public scrutiny 
she was trained as a social worker she has become a leading 
campaigner against apartheid and black activists often call her 
mother of the nation 
another result of her prominence is that some of her personal 
hardships become public events 
when she visits her husband in prison journalists are present 
by the time she reached her burnedout home thursday it was 
surrounded by firefighters police and journalists who already had 
wandered through the smoldering remains 
mrs mandela moved into the modest fourroom bungalow in soweto 
johannesburgs huge black township after she married mandela in 
1958 mandela had owned the house and lived in it since the 1940s 
it has been shot at and stoned by attackers who have not been 
identified police visit it regularly

jesse jacksons latest efforts to obtain the 
release of us hostages in lebanon was coolly received by 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
dukakis during a campaign stop in cleveland said he didnt 
know all the facts about jacksons effort but as a general 
matter private citizens should not try to conduct foreign policy 
the democratic nominee said the reagan administration and the 
un should handle the hostage issue and said a quick end to the 
nearly 8yearold iraniraq war would expedite the release of the 
hostages 
i think they are beginning to make some progress on an end 
to the war dukakis said i think the secretarygeneral of the 
un is the person to provide that mediation 
democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen campaigning 
in reno nev echoed dukakis views saying i normally under 
most conditions like to see officials of the government carrying 
out any negotiations 
i must say jesse jackson has been very effective at times 
in the past in doing some of these things the texas senator 
added 
jackson said he issued an appeal through un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar to impress upon iranian foreign minister 
ali akbar velayati that the release of the hostages is moral and 
humanitarian 
he said he asked de cuellar to appeal to the foreign minister 
to hear our humanitarian plea to hear our mercy appeal and to 
use his strength to help gain the release of the americans held 
hostage 
jackson said no meeting has been set and no meeting has been 
sought for him to negotiate with iranian officials 
at the united nations iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar 
mahallati said the countrys foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
will not meet with jackson to discuss the possible release of 
hostages 
velayati was at the united nations to discuss ending the 
iraniraq war 
on tuesday irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
offered to help get the nine americans freed if the united states 
would release iranian assets frozen since 1979 the reagan 
administration responded that it will make no deals for the 
hostages release 
the hostages are believed to be held by shiite moslems with 
links to iran 
jackson had said he is using several middle eastern diplomats as 
intermediaries in his attempts to negotiate the hostages release 
in january 1984 jackson met directly with president hafez assad 
of syria and arranged the release of navy lt robert o goodman 
jr whose plane was shot down over lebanon dec 4 1983 during an 
american air strike against a syrian antiaircraft position

police raided an apartment before 
dawn today and arrested eight people including renegade soldiers 
believed linked to ousted president ferdinand marcos officials 
said 
col manuel oxales deputy commander of the national capital 
regional defense command said police seized one claymore mine 
plastic explosives and improvised bombs that may have been intended 
for terror attacks in the capital 
oxales said the raid at about 430 am was in a crowded 
neighborhood of suburban caloocan city he said the eight included 
two women and at least two army enlisted men 
two or three others escaped and some tried to escape by 
climbing the walls and climbing to the rooftop he said 
oxales said the eight were being interrogated and could face 
charges of illegal possession of weapons and explosives 
marcos who ruled the philippines for 20 years was deposed in 
february 1986 in a civilianmilitary uprising that swept president 
corozon aquino to power 
oxales said one of those arrested was linked to an abortive 
april 1987 raid on fort bonifacio which the military said was an 
attempt to free rebel troops jailed in a coup attempt three months 
before 
the government said the january 1987 coup attempt was aimed at 
restoring marcos to power the attempt included attacks on media 
and military facilities in the manila area 
oxales said some of those arrested were also suspected of 
involvement in a similar raid last june on camp crame where 
mutineers failed to free jailed coup plotters but made off with two 
dozen rifles 
he said raiders also found street maps and other diagrams that 
they suspected may have been used in planning bombings within the 
capital 
on thursday mrs aquinos chief aide accused marcos of trying 
to evade us prosecution by offering 5 billion to come home 
we saw it for what it was it was just a ploy to get his us 
indictment against him suspended executive secretary catalino 
macaraig said 
mrs aquino has refused to allow the former president to return 
from exile in hawaii 
in new york the village voice reported this month that us 
attorney rudolph giuliani recommended that marcos and his wife 
imelda be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection 
with real estate acquisitions in new york

a man convicted in the stabbing death of his 
8yearold niece was put to death in georgias electric chair 
prompting the victims mother to remark we can finally put our 
baby to rest 
james messer jr died a little more than an hour after the us 
supreme court in a 72 vote refused to stop the execution 
justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan dissented but 
there was no immediate elaboration from the court 
prosecutors said messer abducted rhonda joan tanner from her 
school in 1979 and tried to molest her she bled to death after 
being beaten and stabbed 
the victims father wayne tanner 47 said messers execution 
was a big relief he finally paid 
messer 34 was pronounced dead at 723 pm said department of 
corrections spokesman john siler he was the 13th person to die in 
the states electric chair since georgia resumed executions in 1983 
and the 101st person put to death since the supreme court allowed 
states to restore capital punishment in 1976 
we feel we can finally put our baby to rest said the 
victims mother joyce tanner 45 of cedartown one of about 20 
death penalty advocates who carried placards and demonstrated in 
front of the prison thursday 
messer declined to make a final statement but requested a 
prayer prison chaplain nolan lavell placed his hands on messers 
left forearm and delivered a oneminute prayer while the condemned 
man held his eyes tightly shut 
at the conclusion of the prayer messer said amen and that 
was his last word 
fourteen people witnessed the execution including seven state 
witnesses one of messers attorneys howard manchell and six 
media representatives 
outside the prison 12 antideath penalty protesters sang 
nearly twice as many prodeath penalty demonstrators including one 
man wearing a white ku klu klan robe cheered and clapped when 
messers body was driven out of the prison in a hearse 
messer did not ask for any witnesses to the execution siler 
said his mother mary messer of lagrange and an aunt visited him 
at the prison wednesday 
earlier thursday the georgia board of pardons and paroles 
refused to commute messers sentence to life in prison chairman 
wayne snow said the panel concluded there are insufficient 
grounds for further consideration of the commutation rquest 
snow said the board rejected a psychiatrists testimony that 
messers explosive behavior may have been caused by brain 
damage messer exhibited no such behavior in prison he said and 
the testimony was not a matter that we can base a decision on a 
crime that occurred nine years ago

despite the drought us food exporters this 
year can remain reliable sources for foreign nations that depend on 
them and should make it their top priority to do so says 
agriculture secretary richard lyng 
this year even though our crops are way down combining our 
crops with our carryover well have an ample supply for both our 
domestic and our export needs lyng said thursday at an 
illinoisjapan agricultural trade conference 
japan which depends on imports for 50 percent of its food is 
the best customer of us agriculture lyng said 
the japanese are expected to buy 65 billion in us 
agricultural products this year said mark randal spokesman for 
the illinois department of agriculture cosponsor of the 
conference 
if you think about japans huge purchases from the united 
states and their dependence upon us we must make it clear that 
even in a year when we have a drought we will not restrict 
exports to protect purchases within our own country lyng said 
its absolutely essential that we assure japan that we will 
have enough that we will be responsible he added in his 
15minute talk to about 200 people at the conference cosponsored 
by the japan economic institute of america inc 
lyng said the united states owes a debt of gratitude to the 
japanese for their recent agreement to dismantle many of the trade 
barriers to us products such as beef citrus fruits juices ice 
cream processed cheeses and sugarbased goods 
i compliment the japanese for their effort to modernize and 
update and improve their access he said at a news conference 
after his talk its not easy for them to do that 
nobuo matsunaga japanese ambassador to the united states said 
americans need to be aggressive in their marketing efforts to his 
country because there are many foreign competitors 
he reiterated lyngs call for reliability among us suppliers 
noting that past us export restrictions still evoke bitter 
memories 
in the early 1970s a feared shortage of soybeans in the united 
states prompted an embargo that forced japan unexpectedly to seek 
other markets to fulfill its high demand for soybean products 
randal said 
lyng said us law as well as reagan administration policy now 
supports unrestricted international trade regardless of conditions 
at home 
on the topic of drought relief for american farmers lyng said 
the 6 billion measure approved in congress is a pretty good 
bill despite some provisions the reagan administration opposes 
and some efforts by lobbyists to use the legislation for special 
interests

the ruling sandinista partys 
newspaper saluted a convoy of us veterans that brought food 
medicine and clothing with a banner headline reading veterans 
break boycott 
the newspaper barricada said in its thursday edition that 
thousands of people greeted the convoy of 20 vehicles and 44 
activists when it crossed the hondurannicaraguan border the day 
before after months of opposition from the us government 
the veterans peace convoy was scheduled to arrive in managuas 
downtown revolution plaza today where it will turn over its 
shipment to the leftist government 
the veterans oppose us support of nicaraguan contra rebels 
who have waged a 7yearold war to topple the sandinista government 
the us customs service opposed letting the convoy cross the 
usmexico border saying taking the vehicles to nicaragua would 
violate a 1985 trade embargo humanitarian aid is permitted under 
the embargo but the customs service says the vehicles must return 
to the united states 
the newspaper said us police brutally repressed the group 
in its attempt to bring medicine food and clothes for nicaraguan 
children butchered by the war action of the reagan administration 
eight members of the group were arrested july 9 when they 
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a rio grande 
bridge crossing in laredo texas the convoy finally crossed the 
mexican border at nuevo laredo on july 14 
the customs service said the trucks must return to the united 
states within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of up to 
50000 and 10 years in prison the veterans refused to sign forms 
promising they would return the trucks 
in june us customs officials stopped the original convoy of 
38 vehicles from crossing into mexico about 100 convoy 
participants drove to washington to rally against customs 
decision circling around the white house and in front of the state 
department in three days of protest

parliament rejected proposals for a new abortion 
law ranging from freedom of choice to a ban except in cases of a 
threat to the pregnant womans life 
also thursday the british columbia court of appeal ruled that a 
fetus is not a person 
the national government began searching for a new abortion law 
after the supreme court in january struck down canadas restrictive 
abortion law the lack of a new law has brought abortionondemand 
to many cities and led to angry protests from antiabortion groups 
conservative prime minister brian mulroneys government itself 
split on the issue proposed a compromise in which abortion would 
be easy to obtain early in pregnancy but restricted later on 
that proposal was defeated 147 to 76 and other proposed 
measures also fell the voting followed a twoday debate and the 
issue now goes back to the drawing board 
opposition parties criticized mulroney for staying out of the 
debate or revealing his own views but with a general election 
expected this fall mulroney can go to voters saying that he tried 
to propose a compromise 
the british columbia court of appeal ruled thursday that a 
newborn becomes a person only after it leaves the mothers body 
alive 
the decision overturned the conviction of two midwives charged 
with criminal negligence in the death of a fetus in 1985 
but the court upheld their conviction on charges of causing 
bodily harm to the pregnant woman 
the canadian supreme court is expected to deliver its view this 
fall on whether a fetus has any rights

the former honduran ambassador to panama faces a 
possible life sentence after pleading guilty to charges of 
attempting to smuggle 26 pounds of cocaine hidden in coffee bags in 
his luggage 
rigoberto regalado lara 49 was arrested may 15 at miami 
international airport and immediately stripped of his diplomatic 
immunity by honduran officials 
regalado had initially pleaded innocent but on thursday he told 
us district court judge edward b davis he wanted to change his 
plea to guilty of importing cocaine 
in return assistant us attorney toby vick said the government 
was dropping a second charge of possession with intent to 
distribute 
davis warned regalado that he faces at least 10 years in prison 
and could be sentenced to life as well as fined 4 million on the 
importation charge he asked the former ambassador if he understood 
yes your honor i do regalado responded through an 
interpreter davis set sentencing for sept 14 
vick refused to comment on the case or the plea bargain but 
federal sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
investigation was continuing 
regalado has been held at the federal metropolitan correctional 
center south of miami since his arrest 
honduran authorities cooperated with us drug investigators in 
the case and even threatened to try regalado in his homeland if he 
tried to return there 
prosecutors had asked he be held without bond prior to his plea 
because honduras has no extradition treaty with the united states

ten days after their arrests during the 
democratic national convention 96 antiabortion protesters who 
refuse to give their names remain jailed most vowing to stay until 
their next court date or the city frees them 
lawyers said thursday that the jailed protesters charged with 
criminal trespass cannot be freed on bond until they give 
verifiable proof of their identities 
if we can identify them we can try them explained lee 
obrien fulton countys chief assistant solicitor he said the 
offense carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a fine of 
1000 
demonstrators like this do all they can to frustrate the 
system obrien said if in so doing they are willing to spend 
more time in jail than they would have if any so be it it really 
depends on how far they want to carry it 
the protesters part of an antiabortion effort called operation 
rescue were among 134 arrested july 19 at a clinic near downtown 
atlanta where abortions are performed the city began processing 
them through the court system this week 
we just hope the city will realize it made a mistake and just 
let us go said lowell patterson a spokesman for the protesters 
who is not jailed we have served more time even than we would 
have if we had been found guilty of criminal trespass 
on thursday a man calling himself baby john doe 105 and a woman 
calling herself baby jane doe 111 clutched bibles as they stood 
silently in municipal court a man calling himself baby john doe 
132 was dressed as a priest 
the protesters who are being held at the atlanta corrections 
center say they have taken the names in solidarity with aborted 
fetuses 
judge howard johnson however referred to the prisoners as 
white male 42 or white female 47 as he methodically sent 
their cases to state court 
thirtytwo of those arrested last week have given their names 
and been released on 500 recognizance bonds said tom pocock 
deputy director of the corrections center he said six others were 
identified through other means 
the demonstrators have been brought into court in groups of 
seven or eight for their brief appearances before being returned to 
jail 
the remaining 23 demonstrators were to appear today 
we have 75 percent of our people committed to stay in jail 
until their court hearing assuming it is within the next month or 
so said patterson 
it normally takes two to three months for such a case to reach 
state court 
most of our local people are in jail patterson said 
supporters are coming in from outside the atlanta area and there 
would be large demonstrations in the coming weeks he said but 
declined to elaborate 
similarly charged demonstrators arrested during an antinuclear 
protest at us department of energy offices during the convention 
were sentenced to the five days they had spent awaiting a court 
appearance and were freed 
robert fierer who is representing the demonstrators in court 
said he does not know whether some will reveal their identities to 
get out of jail 
these are people of conscience he said this week they 
have to make their own decisions about these sorts of things

hundreds of unashamed men and women are 
gathering for a convention at a remote campground this weekend to 
elect officers organize committees and get naked 
along with serious business the freewheeling nudists of the 
eastern sunbathing association and their equally unabashed 
children plan to lie in the sun swim and play pingpong 
shuffleboard and volleyball 
looking is not a nono but staring is said turner stokes 
60 of leesburg va an electronics engineer and president of the 
larger american sunbathing association im sure the staring is 
much worse out among the textiles 
textiles the nudist term for people who wear clothes all 
the time in the textile world are aliens at white thorn lodge 
most people seek the breeze the sun the rain and the freedom 
of wearing no pantyhose said lynn arnett 44 a freelance 
writer from paradise lakes fla you tell the first lie of the 
day when you put your clothes on 
about 1000 nudists are expected to show up over the weekend at 
white thorn lodge a pleasant campground on the ohiopennsylvania 
border about 40 miles west of pittsburgh according to lodge 
secretary k mathesius 
convention security was tight thursday clothed and nude men 
guarded the gate reporters who shed only their ties were escorted 
among friendly families sharing lunch at picnic tables smiling 
couples sitting on shaded lawn chairs and naked children running 
across the grass 
its the freedom its the comfort our society equates nudity 
with sexuality but this is a totally nonsexual setting people 
are just people here said mary lou schloss 40 of rochester 
ny a nudism activist who brought her husband and children to the 
convention 
i just like the swimming pool the hot tub and the food 
said her son evan 8 a thirdgrader who wore only cherry soda on 
his face 
the associations membership comprises 55 percent of the 
30000member american sunbathing association which helps 
publicize nudism and rates nudist colonies 
nudists come in all ages sizes and shapes including smooth 
wrinkled and scarred some live in cabins recreational vehicles 
and tents on the grounds 
on thursday all sat on towels and wore convention credentials 
on chains around their necks with temperatures in the high 80s 
some wore only sneakers and some only tshirts since no one has 
pockets the snack bar runs a tab for hamburgers and soft drinks 
officials said only about 10 percent of cardcarrying nudists 
are unmarried women are always wanted 
theres a problem getting women here but then why dont many 
women go into bars by themselves ms arnett said when they 
find out what its all about they say why did it take me so 
long 
stokes said pockets of intolerance have limited nudism to 
homes or to the social or recreational campgrounds health 
clubs and remote beaches 
but he said surveys among nudists show only about 15 percent 
disrobe to get an allover tan 
we wear sunscreen when its appropriate were very aware of 
our bodies stokes said 
when its cold we put clothes on said mrs schloss 
were not fanatics

palestinian killed by army no pickup

<TEXT>
palestinians in the occupied territories 
blocked streets and stayed away from work today to show support for 
women jailed for their roles in the palestinian uprising 
also staterun radio said a palestinian who died in gaza city 
thursday was killed by israeli troops as he prepared to throw a 
firebomb the death touched off demonstrations in which two 
palestinians were wounded by gunfire and two israeli riot police 
were injured by stones 
palestinians throughout the occupied lands went on strike today 
outlawed palestinian flags waved on utility poles from bethlehem to 
nablus in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
graffiti appeared on walls overnight reading death to the 
zionists and yes for a palestinian state 
before dawn palestinian protesters blocked some streets with 
rocks barrels and burning tires an apparent effort to prevent 
palestinians from breaking the strike organized by the underground 
leadership of the uprising that began dec 8 
the strike called to protest the jailing of palestinian women 
halted transportation and shut down shops 
the palestinianrun jerusalem media and communication center 
said 30 palestinian women are being held in israeli jails most on 
suspicion of inciting violence against israel 
an israeli army spokesman said the army was checking the report 
on israels staterun radio that troops fatally shot 37yearold 
hadel hafez el toruk in gaza city 
he died in ahali hospital of wounds sustained on july 22 
hospital officials said the army confirmed the death and said it 
was investigating the circumstances 
toruks family told the army he was shot at the same time 
soldiers opened fire at palestinians who threw a molotov cocktail 
at them toruk said before he died that he did not see his 
assailants a hospital official said 
he said he was walking in the street and then he fell down 
and he didnt know what happened said the hospital official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fatality brought to 235 the number of palestinians killed in 
the antiisraeli revolt four israelis also have died 
meanwhile israeli foreign minister shimon peres said he reacted 
positively to reports that us assistant secretary of state 
richard murphy planned to meet with palestinian representatives 
peres said he was against meetings with members of the palestine 
liberation organization which is banned in israel but did not 
necessarily oppose meetings with plo supporters 
we make a distinction between people who are members of the 
plo which is an organization that deals in terrorism and has a 
charter that calls for the destruction of israel peres said on 
israeli television 
murphy is to leave next week for a peace mission that will take 
him to israel jordan syria and egypt 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said 
thursday she was unaware of plans for murphy to talk to palestinian 
leaders she also said us policy of refusing to meet plo leaders 
remained in place 
peres previously has called for negotiations between israel and 
a joint jordanianpalestinian delegation 
but on thursday jordan said it was changing its policy toward 
the 15 million palestinians in the israelioccupied territories to 
give the plo more responsibility there and avoid friction between 
jordan and the plo 
toward this end jordan announced it was halting a 13 billion 
5year development project in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip the plan was set up in 1986 by agreement with the plo

people during a failed bank heist were returned to china and 
sentenced to death an official newspaper reported today 
the peoples daily saod burma extradited li danian and wang 
yueping to china in february after they sneaked across the border 
the paper said li wang and another accomplice were running a 
business in hunan province that went into debt to pay back the 
debt they decided to start robbing banks 
it said the trio began robbing banks in june 1987 striking 
among others the agricultural bank and the industrial and 
commercial bank in the hunan city of yueyang the paper said they 
failed to steal any money 
on july 7 1987 the paper said the trio broke into another 
yueyang bank and killed a bank guard and a clerk still no money 
was stolen it said 
li and wang then fled to burma their accomplice yi maohua 
stayed behind and was captured 
the paper said the three were sentenced on monday and would be 
executed soon china executes people with a bullet to the back of 
the head 
chinese papers have been devoting more space to reports on crime 
in recent years in almost every case when they report on bank 
heists the papers say the robberies end in failure 
the apparent reason for this is that the staterun press doesnt 
want to encourage copycat crimes

a defense lawyer says the mexicans charged in 
the barbaric killing of a us drug agent are innocent victims and 
he has evidence of a huge coverup designed to protect the highest 
mexican officials 
the three men charged in the kidnapping and murder of enrique 
camarena a drug enforcement administration agent are victims of 
mexicos corrupt judicial system defense attorney barry tarlow 
said in opening arguments thursday 
people destroyed altered and failed to preserve evidence 
tarlow told the jury when you see the widespread corruption it 
becomes impossible to see who is reliable 
the prosecutor in the case said that camarena died in a torture 
chamber at the hands of people trying to elicit information about a 
us drug investigation 
special agent camarenas skull was fractured in numerous 
places in the front of the head and in the back of the head it 
resembled basically a cracked eggshell said assistant us 
attorney jimmy gurule 
at the top of the skull the skull had actually been 
penetrated by a blunt instrument that an object had been driven 
through the skull he said 
tarlow however contends the people responsible for camarenas 
slaying are in a safe haven in mexico 
the sensitivity of the grisly case was evident at the entrance 
of us district judge edward rafeedies courtroom where us 
marshals had set up a metal detector in addition to security 
checks made at the courthouse entrances 
the trial is expected to take about 10 weeks 
the bodies of camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
were found buried at a remote ranch in mexico several weeks after 
they were abducted separately in guadalajara on feb 7 1985 
on trial are rene verdugo urquidez 36 and raul lopez alvarez 
28 who are charged with murdering camarena and zavala and jesus 
felix gutierrez 38 who is charged with being an accessory 
they were among nine people indicted in the case by a federal 
grand jury in los angeles earlier this year four are in custody in 
mexico one was killed by mexican police and one is at large 
camarena was kidnapped in 1985 as he left the us consulate in 
guadalajara after he and other agents uncovered a drug trafficking 
operation said to have been run by reputed mexican drug lord rafael 
caro quintero 
caro also is charged in the killings and is in custody in mexico 
the prosecution alleges camarena was tortured in an effort to 
make him provide information about the us investigation into 
caros activities

it began as a spurofthemoment 
spoof a lighthearted jab at chattanoogas upper crust and their 
yearly social gala the cotton ball 
but the kudzu ball showing a tenacity its leafy little namesake 
would be proud of has slowly become an annual event in its own 
right in this tennessee river town 
people just like to get out and have a good time lr 
tex greenwood one of the balls founders said thursday 
its inexpensive its for a good cause and it gives people a 
chance to act like a bunch of kids its just fun 
the seventh annual kudzu ball complete with its own king and 
queen bluegrass bands and a bestcostume contest is set for 
tonight at the town and country shopping center in north 
chattanooga 
well not exactly the shopping center itself the parking lot 
outside jb amp friends a night spot where the idea was hatched for a 
kooky celebration of the souths most famous weed 
a group of pseudointellectuals was sitting there one night 
and we decided that to quaff em once or twice a week we needed a 
purpose said greenwood 
somebody said lets have a ball and one of us looked out 
the window and there was kudzu all over this hill next to the bar 
and someone said how about a kudzu ball 
kudzu as any southerner worth his grits knows is the oriental 
vine introduced to dixie 50 years ago to stop soil erosion the 
problem was that the pesky little weed didnt know when to stop 
its been known to grow a foot overnight and has proven 
impervious to most efforts to kill it today the creeping choking 
vine blankets seven million acres in 12 southeastern states not to 
mention telephone poles cars houses and lazy dogs who snooze in 
one place too long 
all of which made it the perfect inspiration for an offbeat ball 
thats always been held the same night as the more socially polite 
cotton ball itself named for the souths other famous plant 
greenwood admits the organizing group known as the 
longrangewaydowntheroadandoutofsight planning commission 
may have had an assist from the swine ball nashvilles takeoff on 
its own swan ball 
but the kudzu ball has taken on an identity of its own drawing 
5000 to 7000 people a year into the cozy little parking lot many 
of them festooned with snips of the wily weed 
they like to be like the kudzu itself all cluttered up and 
close together like a bunch of sheep greenwood said 
tickets are 5 each the event has raised about 43000 for the 
chattanooga birth defects center over the years but organizers 
say some of the costumes alone are worth that price 
you might see a greentinted dog with a sign reading kudzu 
mackenzie or a rugged bandoleerandkudzudraped commando 
calling himself kudzo 
greenwood routinely shows up as a bandanaed balladeer named 
kudzu willie and this years ball promises a debate between 
michael dukudzu and gorge bush 
theres plenty of bluegrass music vendors have been known to 
sell a beer or two and the festivities general wind up with the 
selection of a king and queen from a 12member court 
it took awhile for the cotton ball organizers to get used to the 
parody celebration but now said greenwood theyve apparently 
accepted it since some of the debutantes usually show up at the 
kudzu ball after their event is over 
now we have never been invited to theirs and i dont think 
were going to greenwood said chuckling which i dont blame 
em i wouldnt ask me in either

the government says consumer spending increased at the fastest 
pace in 10 months during june but federal reserve board chairman 
alan greenspan has renewed a pledge to keep a tight rein on credit 
to control inflation 
the commerce department on thursday said personal consumption 
spending which includes virtually everything except interest on 
debt shot up a seasonally adjusted 10 percent in june the 
steepest climb since a 13 percent gain last august 
the report was disappointing to many economists who were 
expecting growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow the 
nations trade deficit 
in another economic report the labor department said import 
prices one of the main inflationary threats facing the us 
economy because of the weaker dollar rose 27 percent in the 
apriljune quarter the biggest increase in more than a year 
the climb followed a 12 percent increase in the januarymarch 
period and was the steepest since the 41 percent jump in the first 
three months of 1987 
greenspan in an appearance before a house banking subcommittee 
said the 47percent inflation figure released wednesday as part of 
a report on the secondquarter gross national product was 
somewhat larger than we would have expected 
but he said recent economic indicators have shown no evidence 
that would cause the federal reserve to radically change its 
monetary policy greenspan has indicated before that the fed would 
move to tighten credit if necessary to curb higher inflation 
in the financial markets bond prices usually most sensitive 
to news of inflation fell slightly and interest rates rose the 
yield on the 30year treasury bond was quoted late in the day at 
925 percent up from 923 percent late wednesday 
stock prices rose modestly the dow jones average of 30 
industrials rose 2863 to close at 208233 erasing wednesdays 
20point drop 
also thursday the administration projected the federal deficit 
for the upcoming budget year at 1401 billion short of the 
trigger for acrosstheboard spending cuts but officials warned 
that a hefty droughtrelief bill could cause the automatic 
reductions to kick in

researchers are close to identifying 
the gene responsible for an inherited disorder in which a simple 
inability to break down and dispose of certain fats can kill 
seemingly healthy boys 
as the researchers close in on the gene they are testing a 
specially formulated diet that may prevent the appearance of the 
disease in boys and men who have inherited the genetic defect said 
the leader of the research team dr hugo moser of johns hopkins 
university in baltimore 
the discovery of the gene may allow researchers to insert normal 
cells into the victims bodies to cure the disorder in which 
apparently healthy boys suddenly lose mental faculties got into a 
coma and die 
moser said thursday at a genetics meeting at the jackson 
laboratory in bar harbor maine that the disease which occurs in 
perhaps one in 10000 or one in 20000 people has a devastating 
effect on families 
in its most severe form it usually strikes boys 4 to 8 years 
old moser said they deteriorate to a vegetative state within a 
year and they remain in that state for up to 10 years before 
dying he said 
you can imagine what that does to the family he said 
before the disease appears the boys have no signs of illness 
he said 
one boy lost the ability to distinguish speech early in the 
disease and could understand his mother only by reading her lips 
shortly after moser determined this he got a call saying the boy 
had lost his vision and with it the ability to communicate with 
his mother 
somehow the devastation of a normal child is even harder to 
take than a child that is born impaired moser said 
the disease called adrenoleukodystrophy is caused by the lack 
of an enzyme that helps the body break down and dispose of certain 
fats 
in people with the disorder the abnormal buildup of these 
fats which are called longchain fatty acids damages the adrenal 
gland causing hormonal problems and the insulation surrounding 
nerve cells causing brain damage 
for reasons that scientists do not understand some victims of 
the disease experience only mild problems in adulthood and others 
have no symptoms whatsoever 
moser estimated that 50 percent have the severe childhood form 
30 percent the milder adult form 10 percent only hormonal 
imbalances and 10 percent no symptoms at all 
the genetic defect that causes it can be identified in the fetus 
before birth giving parents the option to terminate the pregnancy 
moser said 
moser told of one family of an aolescent boy who is a champion 
athlete and who carries the genetic defect but has no signs of 
disease his parents have decided not to tell him that he has the 
disease moser said 
moser and his colleagues have now devised a lowfat diet that 
helps prevent the buildup of fats in these children 
they are testing the diet now and do not yet know whether 
preventing the fat buildup in these patients will indeed prevent 
the disease moser said 
bone marrow transplants have also been used in four cases to try 
to prevent the disease he said but bone marrow transplants pose a 
tricky ethical question he said 
as many as 20 percent ot 30 percent of people who get bone 
marrow transplants die as a result of the transplants yet half of 
the victims of adrenoleukodystrophy do not get the severe childhood 
disease so it may be unwise to recommend such a dangerous 
procedure for them moser said 
scientists do not yet know how to predict which people with the 
defect will be severely affected and which will be only mildly 
affected but they are working diligently to determine that moser 
said

three sinhalese extremists and a 
soldier were killed and militants torched buses on the first 
anniversary of an accord aimed at ending tamil separatist violence 
police said today 
most shops offices and businesses were closed today in colombo 
the capital and its surburbs police said people were afraid to 
open their businesses because of possible violence by sinhalese 
radicals opposed to the indianbrokered peace accord 
a 24hour curfew went into effect at 6 am today in the 
islands south after radical sinhalese nationalists called for a 
general strike 
residents in the northern city of vavuniya about 125 miles 
northeast of colombo said by telephone that indian soldiers also 
declared curfews in some areas in the islands north and east until 
sunday morning to prevent attacks by tamil rebels 
the peace accord is opposed both by tamil rebels fighting for 
five years for independence in the north and east of the island and 
by the peoples liberation front an extremist group from the 
islands majority sinhalese community 
the sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority 
while the tamils say it does not meet their demands for 
independence 
three men were killed by police in separate incidents in which 
sinhalese extremists tried to attack government property a police 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity he said a sinhalese sri 
lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with extremists in 
hambantota district in the south 
in southern and central sri lanka strongholds of the sinhalese 
extremists at least eight governmentowned buses were set afire 
thursday night and this morning the police spokesman said 
electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern sri 
lanka were cut thursday night after sinhalese extremists bew up 
electrical transformers he said 
a railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a 
firebomb as it pulled into colombo police said only a few 
governmentowned or private buses were seen running 
in the islands north nearly 50000 indian soldiers deployed 
under the peace accord were put on alert after tamil rebels called 
for a demonstration to protest the peace pact 
on thursday 14 sinhalese farmers were killed by tamil rebels 
near padaviya village about 100 miles northeast of colombo 
the peace accord signed by india and sri lanka on july 29 
1987 calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to 
minority tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight 
for a separate tamil nation 
india agreed help disarm the tamil rebels but violence has 
persisted in the tamil areas of the north and east because the main 
tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam refused to 
accept the accord 
india is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its 
own tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict before 
the peace pact was signed sri lanka regularly accused india of 
training and supplying the rebels 
more than 8000 people have been killed since the ethnic war 
began in 1983 tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people and say they are discriminated 
against by the sinhalese the buddhist sinhalese make up about 75 
percent and control the government and the army 
more than 400 people have been killed since the accord was 
signed in attacks blamed on sinhalese extremists 
most of the victims have been government officials or members of 
the governing united national party of president junius r 
jayewardene who signed the accord

israeli officials today said jordans decision 
to cancel a 13 billion development plan for the israelioccupied 
territories would have no practical effect because the plan existed 
primarily on paper 
palestinian leaders in the west bank were divided on the impact 
some said it would seriously hurt some residents already struggling 
financially because of the 8monthold palestinian uprising in the 
occupied lands 
jordan announced thursday it was canceling the development 
program in a move to hand over more responsibility for the 15 
million arabs in the occupied west bank and gaza strip to the 
palestine liberation organization 
meron benvenisti an israeli expert on the west bank said he 
thought the move was the first step toward a decision by jordans 
king hussein eventually to cut ties with the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip altogether 
he wants to see how people react but ultimately he has no 
choice but to cut ties benvenisti head of the west bank data 
bank a usfunded research project said in an interview 
if he doesnt he gives money to people who in the long run 
are his enemies said benvenisti referring to a growing 
antijordanian slant among west bank palestinians 
he said husseins plan was a bubble king hussein didnt have 
the money for the project he hoped to get foreign governments to 
donate funds 
it is difficult to gauge how much of the 13 billion has 
reached the occupied territories deposed gaza city mayor rashad 
shawaa said the gaza strip had received about 66 million 
foreign minister shimon peres said the jordanian measure would 
not affect his approach to a middle east peace settlement based on 
israelijordanian negotiations 
hussein and peres of the leftleaning labor party agreed last 
year to hold direct talks in the framework of an international 
peace conference the accord was vetoed by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc 
peres speaking on israel radio said jordan remained crucial to 
a resolution of the palestinian problem because the 850000 west 
bank palestinians hold jordanian passports the west bank and 
jordan have strong trade links and israel and jordan share a long 
border 
in gaza city shawaa known for his projordanian views said in 
an interview that the move was regrettable because people here 
need help and this was an important source of help 
but mustafa natsche deposed mayor of the west bank city of 
hebron and a plo supporter said the amman decision will not 
affect anybody 
natsche said the palestinians in the west bank needed 
contributions from all the arab countries not just jordan but he 
said what they needed most was to be steadfast in their struggle to 
end israeli occupation 
the fiveyear project was set up by jordan in 1986 under an 
agreement with yasser arafats plo it was to improve health 
education housing cultural and other services in the territories 
israel took the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt during the 1967 arabisraeli war twothirds of jordans 35 
million people are of palestinian origin

north korea today said it proposed a conference 
with us lawmakers so the nations can discuss a peace accord that 
would replace the 1953 armistice ending the korean war 
pyongyangs official korean central news agency said the 
proposal was made by chairman yang hyong sop of the supreme 
peoples assembly in a letter sent to the leaders of the us house 
and senate 
it said yang proposed that the talks be held at the earliest 
possible date in pyongyang new york or any third country between 
the two delegations each comprising seven to nine legislators 
it would be good to discuss measures for cooperation between 
the two parliaments in replacing the korean armistice agreement 
with a peace agreement it quoted yangs letter as saying 
the armistice was signed by north korea and china on one side 
and the united nations command led by the united states on the 
other it ended the bloody korean war which began in 1950 when 
north korea invaded the south in an attempt to unify the korean 
peninsula by force 
protesters in south korea have demanded that the united states 
sign a peace treaty that would replace the armistice agreement the 
two koreas are technically still at war since no treaty has been 
signed 
last week north korea sent a proposal to south korea calling 
for joint sessions between their legislatures to draw up a 
nonaggression pact to end the enmity and rivalry that have 
prevailed since the peninsula was divided at the end of world war 
ii 
the south korean national assembly said it was ready to accept 
the north korean call for talks on the nonaggression pact and the 
norths possible participation in the olympic games in seoul in 
september 
the latest north korean peace offer to the united states was the 
first in four years in 1984 pyongyang proposed a tripartite 
conference among the two koreas and the united states to seek a 
permanent peace and an eventual reunification of the korean 
peninsula 
the 1984 proposal was rejected by both south korea and the 
united states on grounds that peace and unification were matters to 
be settled between the two koreas 
after the 1984 proposal president reagan at a state dinner 
honoring chinese premier zhao ziyang in washington told reporters 
it would be just wonderful if there would be a fourway 
conference with china and both koreas and the united states 
the latest proposal was made in cordial diplomatic language 
free from the norths usual vitriolic hyperbole 
the best way we and the united states can choose at present is 
to have peace negotiation to slacken the whetting swords and firing 
guns against each other or cease them completely yangs letter 
said 
yang said he made the proposal recognizing that we and the 
united states directly responsible parties for easing tension and 
providing peace in korea must sit at the table as soon as 
possible

president virgilio barco said his 
government would not participate in churchsponsored peace talks 
today with leftist guerrillas and that any insurgents who come to 
the table will be jailed 
barcos decision thursday dashed hopes for a quick settlement to 
a guerrilla war that killed 75000 people in 25 years barco acted 
after military leaders criticized the proposed talks 
but barco in a communique said his government planned to study 
recommendations by the conference the meeting was to include 
church leaders former presidents 20 congressmen and a former 
presidential candidate who was kidnapped and later freed by the 
guerrillas 
the leader of the april 19 movement carlos pizarro leongomez 
planned to send a taperecorded message to the gathering a pizarro 
spokesman carlos ramiro lucio escobar said at a news conference 
thursday 
the spokesman said the government decision not to participate 
could be a mistake an estimated 10000 to 20000 guerrillas 
operate in colombia 
the guerrilla group also known as m19 demanded peace talks as 
a condition for the release earlier this month of the former 
presidential candidate it kidnapped 
the government refused to meet the demand for the release of 
alvaro gomez hurtado who was abducted may 29 in a hail of 
submachinegun fire in bogota 
the guerrilla group released gomez anyway and the government 
said it would think about negotating with the insurgents 
church leaders and members of the countrys two leading 
political groups the conservative and liberal parties met in 
panama with m19 guerrillas to win gomezs release 
those who met with the guerrillas said that regardless of the 
governments decision they would organize a peace conference in 
bogota after gomez was freed gomez the son of former president 
laureano gomez said he would attend 
the m19 also took over the palace of justice nov 7 1985 in an 
attack that left 115 dead including 11 supreme court justices 
bishop dario castrillon hoyos has been the driving force behind 
organizing the peace conference 
after meeting thursday with barco at the presidential palace he 
revealed the governments refusal to attend the peace conference 
and said he could understand the difficult position barco is in 
castrillon did not elaborate but he undoubtedly was referring 
to the militarys opposition to peace talks the nation wants to 
stop the war the bishop said it has to be stopped 
the countrys two most powerful generals the minister of 
defense rafael samudio and the head of the chiefs of staff jaime 
guerrero have said they oppose any peace talks with the rebels 
but the two generals in an apparent attempt to calm fears of a 
military coup attempt also said they would abide by any government 
decision to negotiate with the insurgents 
barcos communique said his government might offer pardons to 
guerrillas for political crimes but even that position left little 
hope of any reconciliation between the government and the 
guerrillas 
political crimes by the governments definition do not include 
the majority of guerrilla activities kidnappings ambushes on 
army patrols and bloody raids on dozens of towns in the last 25 
years

iraqibacked iranian rebels said they 
pulled out of two towns in western iran today after killing or 
wounding 40000 iranian revolutionary guards during three days of 
fighting 
but iran said its forces drove the rebels out of the iranian 
towns of eslamabad and karand killing or wounding at least 1000 
enemy troops in a battle with the forces of the baghdad regime 
and their hypocritical mercenaries 
at the united nations on thursday representatives for both gulf 
war foes accused each other of blocking un efforts to end the 
nearly 8yearold war 
tehran radio interrupted its normal programs to play martial 
music and announce victory over the rebels members of the national 
liberation army of iran 
in a later announcement the radio said iranian forces were 
advancing in a bid to liberate the iraqioccupied iranian towns of 
sare pole zahab and gilane gharb 
the national liberation army rebels operate a series of bases or 
camps along the border usually just on the iraqi side of the 
frontier

its guerrillas penetrated 95 miles into iran and controlled karand 
and eslamabad near the central border for 72 hours 
it said that during the fighting two iranian f4 jet fighters 
and two cobra helicopter gunships were shot down and hundreds of

earlier iran said its forces broke through the defenses of the 
iraqis and the national liberation army at eslamabad 
irans official islamic republic news agency monitored in

4000 iraqis and mercenaries in the battle

iraq demands a facetoface meeting with iran before a 
ceasefire and iran insists on a truce before it will consider a 
direct talks 
pressure was increasing on iraq in the 15member un security 
council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that 
could prolong the fighting according to un diplomats speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the foreign ministers of both countries have met separately in 
new york with un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the talks were made possible on when iran which has suffered a 
series of battlefield setbacks in recent months on july 18

ceasefire in the war iraq accepted the resolution shortly after 
it was passed

as sand trickled through an hourglass on 
johnny carsons desk arkansas gov bill clinton humorously sought 
to deflate the windbag image he gained from a muchreviled speech 
at the democratic national convention 
clinton who has been called a windbag in carsons jokes about 
the speech traded quips with the tonight show host thursday 
before jamming on saxophone with the shows band 
and he told carson that contrary to some opinions his 
overlong introduction of the democrats presidential nominee 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis was a stunning success 
my sole goal was achieved he said i wanted so badly to 
make dukakis look great and i succeeded beyond my wildest dreams 
clinton who had been given 15 minutes to introduce the 
governor talked for more than twice that long 
he said of dukakis he called me a few days ago and he said he 
thought the speech was great everything was forgiven and would i 
please nominate george bush in new orleans clinton said to 
applause and laughter from the shows studio audience 
carson told the audience during his shows opening monologue 
that clinton was to be a guest and added not to worry we have 
plenty of black coffee and extra cots in the lobby 
he later introduced clinton with a satirical longwinded speech 
of his own that included details ranging from the governors 
educational background to the first name of new jerseys democratic 
sen bill bradley 
after clinton sat on the couch carson said my first question 
is how are you carson then turned over the hourglass 
later saying hed already proved he could mess up with his 
voice the governor said hed see if he could mess up with a 
song and impressed the crowd with his performance on tenor 
saxophone 
clinton said the speech was unintentionally drawn out but was 
meant to introduce dukakis to millions of americans who werent 
familiar with his accomplishments 
asked about his own ambitions for higher office the governor 
said depends on how i do on the show tonight

nasa today postponed the crucial 
launch pad testfiring of discoverys three main engines another 
three days when an attempt to fuel the space shuttle ran into 
problems with equipment not used since the challenger disaster 
the postponement from monday to thursday was the third delay of 
the test in a week and could put off the first postchallenger 
shuttle flight already delayed until late september until 
october officials said 
preparations for loading 500000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen into discoverys fuel tank began thursday night but 
the launch team quickly had trouble with sensors and an oxygen pump 
technicians resolved those problems but a leak in a hydrogen 
line and another balky oxygen pump finally forced a postponement 
early today 
the test will be postponed a minimum of 72 hours with the 
launch team hoping to resume the first phase of the countdown 
sunday night for the testfiring at 730 am thursday said nasa 
spokesman george diller 
it was the first time a shuttle had been fueled on launch pad 
39b since the challenger exploded shortly after liftoff jan 28 
1986 killing its crew of seven 
all of the problems thursday night and today were in ground 
support equipment and not on the shuttle itself 
the first part of the countdown was to have ended this morning 
with a simulated problem and postponement just 10 seconds before a 
mock liftoff the launch team then was to have emptied the fuel 
tank started a new countdown and refilled the tank targeting the 
testfiring for monday 
the firing will test several modifications made to the engines 
and is considered critical to certifying discovery for flight 
the latest shuttle difficulty came a day after engineers came up 
with a solution for a major problem they recommended that cutting 
a hole through discoverys cargo bay would be the quickest and best 
way to reach and fix a small gas leak in an engine compartment 
without removing the vehicle from the pad 
the recommended repair would take about two weeks the 
alternative would be to take discovery back to a hangar which 
could postpone the flight to as late as sometime in november 
cutting the 20inchsquare hole through the rear of the cargo 
bay would give engineers access to the tiny leak which is on a 
vent line in an engine compartment once they cut through they 
would enshroud the leak in a clamshell device filled with a sealant 
as a backup the engineers recommended pushing a device 
resembling a badminton shuttlecock through the 27footlong line 
trailed by a sealing agent 
the two options were among several ideas tested to plug the leak 
without taking discovery off the pad 
the leak and the delays in the enginefiring countdown have 
pushed nasas internal working launch date to sept 13 and 
officials concede they are facing a late september launch even if 
they can fix the leak on the pad 
the managers did not commit themselves to cutting the hole 
because they want to see what happens after discoverys three main 
engines are ignited for 20 seconds 
engineers said the firing in which the shuttle will be bolted 
to the pad while its main engines generate groundshaking thrust of 
11 million pounds could enlarge the leak or even lead to another 
problem that would require a rollback from the launch pad 
the main engines are separate from the steering engine system 
that contains the leak

missing chicago newlyweds who sought perfect 
love while working anonymously in california delicatessens said 
they dont feel compelled to make amends for the costly police 
search prompted by their disappearance 
scott swanson said thursday he believes it is the chicago police 
rankandfile rather than department officials who want to see 
some kind of payment because they feel really gypped that they 
didnt find the college couple who dropped out of sight in april 
its like the police said here are some yuppie kids from 
wheaton college they just took off and we have no clues and we 
didnt know what to do and they look silly so they might want to 
retaliate swanson said 
nobody cares its over with said a chicago officer in the 
missing persons bureau who declined to give his name 
chicago police cmdr ettore divito who headed the 
investigation said wednesday police might try to recover the costs 
of their efforts we are disheartened that we expended so many 
manhours he said 
when swansons expensive car was found ransacked and with the 
engine running in a chicago alley it prompted a multistate search 
as well as prayer vigils by classmates at wheaton a private 
evangelical christian college 
swanson 23 and his bride carolyn swanson 22 said they find 
it difficult to explain why they vanished leaving family and 
friends in anguish 
we feel like were on a different level than a lot of people 
in their relationship carolyns my life and me to her her to 
me i would die for her and she would die for me swanson said 
the two were pursuing a perfect love that they felt was 
within reach if they escaped from the daily routine of life said 
jim maclean carolyns father wednesday maclean and his wife 
kathy of haddonfield nj flew to san diego after receiving a 
letter from the couple 
we do forgive them but they are going to have to put the 
pieces of their lives back together themselves nancy swanson 
scotts mother said thursday from her suburban chicago home the 
swansons talked with the young couple by telephone but had not yet 
seen them 
the newlyweds said they revealed their whereabouts after carolyn 
was asked for her social security number by her delicatessen 
employer which they feared would give them away 
swanson said they dont feel worthy to contact their friends 
right now feeling that they failed them 
its a paradoxical situation the hurt that weve caused and 
the benefit thats come from this mrs swanson said 
swanson said they came here because they didnt know anyone 
and no one knew us it has a climate that is conducive to living 
outdoors if we needed to bum it for a while 
the couple said they intend to remain in san diego and continue 
their education swanson said he will pursue his goal of the 
military reserve and wants to teach while his wife said she plans 
to write books 
however swanson called into work thursday apologized and quit 
said scott brookes manager of glen courtfour swanson also called 
the sandwiched inn and said his wife wouldnt be working there any 
more said laura rosenthal 
the swansons could not be reached immediately for comment about 
quitting their jobs

of damage a geophysicist said 
a quake of 42 on the richter scale was recorded at 10 pm

police blamed leftist guerrillas for a power 
outage that blacked out central peru hours after president alan 
garcia demanded tougher laws against terrorism 
the outage at 8 pm thursday was the second in less than 24 
hours it plunged lima and cities along 600 miles of coastline into 
darkness said jose acedo a spokesman for the state power company 
electroperu 
the blackout and an power outage wednesday night both were 
blamed on members of the maoist shining path guerrilla movement 
acedo said he said guerrillas bombed power pylons near lima on 
wednesday and may have done the same thing thursday 
power on thursday was restored within 15 minutes in most areas 
and police said they had no reports of violence 
garcia vowed thursday that peru would step up its battle against 
drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas that defend them 
the united states can count on our decided help peru will not 
resign itself to being and exporter of poison garcia said in his 
state of the nation address referring to perus reputation among 
international antidrug officials as the worlds cocaine cradle 
the government said 4400 people were arrested this week in lima 
during an operation aimed at preventing guerrilla attacks over the 
independence days thursday and today 
garcia said leftist guerrilla violence was perus major problem 
and proposed tougher laws to combat it including penalties against 
guerrilla leaders who do not participate in attacks and against 
media that promote and justify subversion 
the law now favors terrorists they are taking advantage of 
freedom of the press garcia said in an obvious reference to the 
lima newspaper el diaro considered the voice of the shining path 
he disclosed that an eightyear insurgency by the organization 
had claimed 15000 lives 
garcia also charged the shining path had become the armed hand 
of peruvian drug traffickers

the weekly magazine ashshiraa reported 
today that negotiations are under way for the release of the nine 
american and nine other foreigners held hostage by iranianbacked 
factions in lebanon 
the issue of the foreign hostages held in lebanon will find 
its way to a happy ending soon the magazine quoted an 
unidentified informed security source as saying 
highlevel contacts are under way between officials of the 
hostages nations especially the united states and a state that 
has direct influence on the hostages it said 
it quoted the source as saying that no intermediaries were 
involved 
a settlement to the hostages issue will coincide with the 
us presidential elections nov 8 the report said it did not 
elaborate 
the magazine gained international fame when it broke the story 
of secret us arms sales to iran in return for the release of 
hostages in 1986 but most of its recent reports on the hostages 
have not proved accurate 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said wednesday his 
country would be prepared to help get the hostages released if 
president reagan released frozen iranian assets 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater responded 
to rafsanjanis offer by saying no deals the clearest signal 
they could send is to release the hostages 
the longest held hostage is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was seized in west 
beirut on march 16 1985

ten sinhalese extremists and a soldier 
were killed and militants torched buses on the first anniversary of 
an accord aimed at ending tamil separatist violence police said 
today 
most shops offices and businesses were closed today in colombo 
the capital and its surburbs police said people were afraid to 
open their businesses because of possible violence by sinhalese 
radicals opposed to the indiabrokered peace accord 
a 24hour curfew went into effect at 6 am today in the 
islands south after radical sinhalese nationalists called for a 
general strike 
residents in the northern city of vavuniya about 125 miles 
northeast of colombo said by telephone that indian soldiers also 
declared curfews in some areas in the islands north and east until 
sunday to prevent attacks by tamil rebels 
the peace accord is opposed both by tamil rebels fighting for 
five years for independence in the north and east of the island and 
by the peoples liberation front an extremist group from the 
islands majority sinhalese community 
the sinhalese say it makes too many concessions to the minority 
while the tamils say it does not meet their demands for 
independence 
military officials said at least 10 sinhalese extremists were 
killed by police overnight during a series of unsuccessful attacks 
on government property in central and southern sri lanka 
strongholds of the peoples liberation front 
a sinhalese sri lankan soldier was fatally shot in a battle with 
extremists in hambantota district in the south police officials 
said 
ten governmentowned buses and two government offices also were 
set ablaze by the sinhalese radicals said the officials who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
militants launched two unsuccessful attacks on army and police 
posts in the islands south but no casualties resulted the 
officials said 
electricity supplies to at least four towns in southern sri 
lanka were cut thursday night after sinhalese extremists blew up 
electrical transformers he said 
a railroad engineer was injured when his train was hit by a 
firebomb as it pulled into colombo police said only a few 
governmentowned or private buses were seen running 
in the islands north nearly 50000 indian soldiers deployed 
under the peace accord were put on alert after tamil rebels called 
for a demonstration to protest the peace pact 
on thursday 14 sinhalese farmers were killed by tamil rebels 
near padaviya village about 100 miles northeast of colombo 
the peace accord signed by india and sri lanka on july 29 
1987 calls for the government to grant limited autonomy to 
minority tamils in exchange for the rebels giving up their fight 
for a separate tamil nation 
india agreed help disarm the tamil rebels but violence has 
persisted in the tamil areas of the north and east because the main 
tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam refused to 
accept the accord 
india is involved in the conflict because of the sympathy of its 
own tamil minority of 60 million for the island conflict before 
the peace pact was signed sri lanka regularly accused india of 
training and supplying the rebels 
more than 8000 people have been killed since the ethnic war 
began in 1983 tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people and say they are discriminated 
against by the sinhalese the buddhist sinhalese make up about 75 
percent and control the government and the army 
more than 400 people have been killed since the accord was 
signed in attacks blamed on sinhalese extremists 
most of the victims have been government officials or members of 
the governing united national party of president junius r 
jayewardene who signed the accord

two major news organizations say they will 
appeal a federal judges ruling holding the lid of secrecy on 
search warrants in the wideranging pentagon bribery probe 
i think the decision is clearly wrong rex heinke 
representing the los angeles times said after us district judge 
david kenyon ruled against the times and copley newspapers on 
thursday 
attorneys for both organizations said they would go to a federal 
appeals court next week to seek a reversal of the order keeping 
search warrants and affidavits sealed indefinitely 
another request to unseal documents in the probe was denied in 
bridgeport conn on thursday by us district judge tf gilroy 
daly ruling against the hartford courant 
the newspaper has not decided whether to appeal said managing 
editor mike jenner 
the investigation which became public last month centers on 
allegations that defense industry consultants bribed pentagon 
officials for inside information useful in winning 
multimilliondollar contracts 
kenyon overturned a federal magistrates ruling july 15 granting 
access to the material the government had argued that release of 
the documents might prompt targets of the probe to destroy evidence 
kenyon who heard arguments from the times copley nbc and cbs 
said he did not wish to minimize the importance of the role of 
the press especially in matters of extreme public interest such as 
the investigation concerned herein 
however the court finds that on balance the publics 
interest in a complete and uninhibited investigation strongly 
outweighs its need for or right of access to the search warrant 
affidavits at this time he said 
all it says is that the government has concern about possible 
destruction of evidence said heinke anything is possible 
there is no showing that it is probable or likely 
harold fuson attorney for copley said the government has a 
responsibility to allow scrutiny of documents supporting a search 
the documents detail searches conducted june 14 at northrop 
corp teledyne electronics litton industries and the home of 
defense consultant fred lackner the only segments released so far 
were introductions showing that wiretaps had been used in each case 
news organizations have gone to court in several states to seek 
access to search warrants and supporting documents on first 
amendment grounds 
the courant had sought access to affidavits used to gain search 
warrants for norden systems offices 
norden a subsidiary of hartfordbased united technologies 
corp is suspected of benefiting from inside information to build 
a battlefield communication system for the marines according to 
documents already released

the african national congress has drafted 
constitutional guidelines for a multiparty democracy in south 
africa in response to criticism that its political programs are too 
vague the new york times reported today 
the guidelines call for an independent judiciary that would 
enforce constitutional guarantees including freedom of the press 
freedom of religion and freedom of association the times said 
the guidelines resulted from two years of study by an anc 
committee of lawyers and political scientists and have circulated 
only within anc ranks and to a select group of experts sympathetic 
to its aim of overthrowing white rule in south africa the 
newspaper said they are far more specific than the ancs 1955 
blueprint known as the freedom charter it said 
the guidelines call for a multiparty democracy but ban parties 
advocating racism or tribalism and would provide for wide 
government supervision of the economy to protect the entire 
population the times said they do not specify whether there would 
be a president or a prime minister it said 
there is a growing acceptance that apartheid cannot last 
anc leader oliver r tambo 72 told the times in lusaka zambia 
but we think there should be greater clarity and consensus on 
what a constitution should say 
the newspaper said the guidelines are a response to criticism by 
some western leaders and white liberals in south africa that the 
ancs political program is too vague 
the right to education to own property to employment and 
shelter would be established as ideals but the difficulty of 
putting these into practice would be taken into account the times 
said 
the guidelines also call for affirmative action to fix the 
historical imbalances in employment caused by apartheid and the 
scrapping of the 1913 and 1936 land acts which set aside 13 
percent of the country for blacks it said 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
the times said land redistribution would be limited because 
property for personal use and consumption shall be 
constitutionally protected

the postal service is spending 700000 to 
come up with a stickier stamp but dont expect it to taste any 
better 
taste is a very personal thing what weve always sought in 
taste and where we think we are is neutral and bland and wed 
like to stay neutral and bland said gordon c morison a senior 
assistant postmaster general 
morison opened a daylong conference thursday at battelle 
memorial institute with about 100 adhesive industry executives and 
technical experts on how to lick the problem of stamps that dont 
stay stuck 
the postal service has a 16month contract with battelle aimed 
at persuading the industry to develop a gum that will keep stamps 
glued to mail zipping through highspeed automated processing 
equipment 
taste is in the tongue of the users and this contract really 
has nothing to do with that morison said 
he acknowledged that the postal service regularly gets 
suggestions about improving the taste of stamps 
in fact one other country i think it was great britain 
tried some flavored gums at one point in time but they got so many 
complaints from the people who didnt like the strawberry or the 
raspberry flavor he said you cant satisfy everybody because 
we all have different tastes 
adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail 
is sorted manually or mechanically but the arrival of highspeed 
automated processing in which stamps are coated with a compound 
that activates processing equipment requires a stronger adhesive 
our letters go through our processing equipment very very 
fast in the time that it takes for a baseball pitcher to throw a 
ball 90 miles per hour we probably process 10 letters or so in 
that fraction of a second almost he said 
in doing that you are again putting a great deal of stress on 
the stamp 
morison said the problem is not acute yet but some customers 
have complained about letters that were destroyed or returned 
because the stamps fell off 
when you look at the magnitude of the postal service 
operation its very minor because we carry so many pieces of mail 
every day we have absolutely no problem with he said 
but when we see something developing and we see there is an 
issue here then in that case we want to fix it and get it fixed 
very quickly

a traffic cop suspected of writing more 
than 1000 bogus tickets in seven years says he didnt have the 
heart to hand out the real thing 
i just could not bring myself to write tickets patrolman 
michael ghrist said wednesday in an interview i had a 
conscience i had a heart i started seeing the human beings 
behind the drivers wheels 
ghrist said he began to write one or two bogus tickets a week in 
the names of motorists who didnt exist about a year and a half ago 
however judge donald smalley said this week that a computer 
listing of all the tickets ghrist has written since 1981 shows that 
more than 1000 are in the names of people for whom no kentucky 
drivers license could be found 
we have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious 
smalley said 
ghrist 36 who has been with the department 17 years was 
suspended earlier this month for 25 days 
police chief richard dotson concluded that the officer wrote 
bogus tickets to maintain high enforcement statistics 
safety director thomas kuster who suspended ghrist said 
wednesday he was unaware there may have been more than 1000 
questionable tickets and lt col john aubrey said the 
investigation would be reopened 
in a letter to kuster dotson said he considered recommending 
ghrists firing but decided on leniency because the officer was not 
motivated by personal profit for example he passed up special pay 
for court appearances

two members of the rival bloods and crips 
gangs clasped hands after three days of talks that were pronounced 
a success by organizers despite the failure to produce an agreement 
to stop the bloodshed 
gang experts and civic leaders however were skeptical of 
whether the talks were worthwhile 
theyll go back into their gangs and theyll talk with their 
gang members and convince them to lay down their weapons said 
the rev charles mims jr who set up the talks between 12 gang 
members in this los angeles suburb 
mims and gang members present said the talks that ended thursday 
were beneficial despite the lack of an agreement to end the gang 
fighting which has claimed more than 165 lives in los angeles 
county this year 
we want to live man we dont want to die but we dont have 
nothing else to do said a bloods member who called himself 
twilight twilight clasped hands with a member of the crips who 
called himself twelve 
the los angeles chapter of the naacp had withdrawn support for 
the talks and although she supported the idea of talking versus 
shooting state sen diane watson said gang members should not be 
treated like ambassadors from warring nations 
mims acknowledged the gang members participating are not leaders 
of gangs although he said they hold influence with their groups 
police estimate gang membership in los angeles county at 
100000 gang members belong to hundreds of sets that are 
loosely aligned as crips bloods or dozens of other smaller gangs

students shouted slogans and plastered 
posters with antigovernment phrases on burmas holiest buddhist 
shrine today following changes that brought to power a political 
hardliner 
burmese returning from worship at the goldladen shwedagon 
pagoda said a small number of students stood atop water tanks at 
the shrine thursday evening gave antigovernment speeches and 
shouted slogans 
the students returned before noon today but there were no 
reports of violence or confrontation with authorities 
some commotion erupted on the crowded pagoda grounds thursday 
when pilgrims dispersed in panic following a fight between some 
youths no injuries were reported 
the shwedagon pagoda in the northern suburbs of rangoon has 
been a traditional gathering place for political dissenters 
including those who fought british colonialism 
last month authorities surrounded and briefly closed the pagoda 
after students set up a strike center designed to coordinate 
antigovernment protest the students entered the pagoda precincts 
following a week of rioting in rangoon official accounts said nine 
people died in the rioting 
following the june unrest which spread to other burmese cities 
and towns the government closed virtually all universities they 
are scheduled to reopen next month 
students also have been spreading leaflets in the burmese 
capital denouncing sein lwin who was elected both president and 
chairman of the ruling political party he succeeded ne win who 
wielded power for 26 years 
according to western and burmese sources sein lwin commanded 
riot police who brutally put down student demonstrations here last 
march with a long record of harsh action against dissenters sein 
lwins elevation to the countrys most powerful positions is likely 
to spark more unrest 
since october violent studentled demonstrations have erupted 
three times in addition to demands for greater freedom within the 
militarycontrolled state protesters are demanding better economic 
conditions in this once prosperous country 
western diplomats are watching how students will act after 
classes resume on saturday ne win warned that if the army is 
called out to suppress protets it would shoot to hit rather 
than just scare 
the small shwedagon demonstration was the first known public 
protest in rangoon since the leadership changes 
a curfew remained in effect in the town of myede 220 miles 
north of rangoon after mobs destroyed buildings and clashed with 
police tuesday officials said one person was killed and five 
wounded 
it was not clear whether that unrest was politically related it 
appeared to have been sparked by strife between moslems and 
buddhists who are the majority in burma 
a number of outbursts in recent months started as minor personal 
or ethnic quarrels and escalated into antigovernment riots

florida will use the national guard to 
defend its borders against drug smuggling in a federally funded 
program that could lead to wider use of the military in the states 
battle against narcotics 
maj gen robert f ensslin jr adjutant general of the 
department of military affairs said only volunteers will be used 
in the monthlong mission primarily in southeastern florida where 
most of the drug activity is based 
ensslin said thursday the guard will concentrate on surveillance 
and intelligence in the program beginning next week there is a 
very very low danger quotient and practically no opportunity for 
confrontation he said 
guard personnel trained as military police or in the special 
forces are particulary well suited for the job ensslin said 
the pilot program will be evaluated within about a month to 
decide whether it should be expanded ensslin 
authorities have estimated that up to 70 percent of the illegal 
drugs entering the united states come through florida which has 
1350 miles of coastline 
it is not the first time the florida guard has been used in 
antidrug work in 1986 several units took park in a weeklong 
exercise helping state law officers search the piney woodlands of

the chief us delegate to the stalled 
helsinki conference said today the meeting still has a long way 
to go despite some progress in the human rights field by the 
soviet union and its allies 
the conference of security and cooperation in europe had been 
tentatively scheduled to end today but delegates say it is likely 
to continue into the fall 
despite some fairly substantial progress in a number of 
countries including of course the soviet union there is still a 
long way to go to reach agreement on a final document us chief 
delegate warren zimmermann told reporters 
zimmermann said that in the soviet union prisoners of 
conscience and activists were in labor camps or forced exile 
because of things they have thought or things they have said 
i think time is long past when that kind of violation should 
continue zimmermann said adding that some western radio 
broadcasts including israeli and west german radio programs for 
soviet listeners are still jammed in the soviet union 
the vienna meeting attended by the soviet union the united 
states canada and all european states except albania began in 
november 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 helsinki accords 
on military security in europe economic cooperation and 
humanitarian issues including human rights 
the delegates have been deadlocked over a final document 
western delegates say the document should advance the provisions 
contained in the 1975 accords and documents concluded at previous 
followup meetings 
zimmermann singled for criticism a romanian government project 
to raze 7000 villages in a nationwide resettlement plan that 
critics say will destroy the traditional life of ethnic hungarians 
in bulgaria zimmermann said the 900000strong turkish 
minority was still being deprived of its ethnic rights 
in may europes nine neutral and nonaligned countries 
introduced a draft compromise document designed to help east and 
west reach a successful conclusion but western diplomats say 
disagreement persists in the human rights area 
we still have to get good agreement on such important issues 
as freedom of religion rights of national minorities and the 
right of radio broadcasts to enter freely zimmermann said 
until we get an agreement on these issues its hard to see how 
we can end this meeting

money donated for ronnie desillers three liver 
transplants will be used to pay medical bills debts and help other 
children in need of transplants and not a penny will go to the 
boys mother a judge ruled 
maria desillers has been accused of misusing some of 689000 in 
donations that poured in before her 7yearold son died awaiting a 
fourth transplant at a pittsburgh hospital in 1987 the donations 
included 1000 from president reagan 
circuit judge francis christie on thursday refused to give ms 
desillers and her former husband ronald any claim to the 
remaining 243500 he said to do so would be erroneous and a 
judicial absurdity 
to allow the contributions donated by caring and affected 
american people to descend to ronnies parents would 
unjustly enrich persons not entitled to the same christie wrote 
the judge ordered that money in the boys estate be used to pay 
hospital bills and other debts with any remaining money going to 
other needy ill children 
courtappointed curator karen gievers ordered to oversee the 
money hailed the decision i think that this should reassure 
people who gave money that itll be used for the purpose 
intended she said 
ms gievers said she will try to recoup some of the 200000 ms 
desillers allegedly gave to friends and relatives or spent on such 
items as jewelry and a bmw sports car 
there were things done by people that should not have been 
done if they are substantial well litigate ms gievers said 
well be looking at each and every person who received the 
funds 
the curator charges that ms desillers paid herself 96526 from 
donations 23700 to her boyfriend 13500 for the bmw 10850 
in jewelry 6000 in rent for her highrise bayfront apartment and 
8000 in clothing and furniture only 44359 was spent on other 
children who required transplants ms gievers said 
a tearyeyed ms desillers refused to speak with reporters and 
did not return a telephone call her attorney harry robbins said 
the decision would be appealed 
maria had a dream that she wanted to realize and now that 
dream cannot come true he said 
mrs desillers is under investigation by the dade county state 
attorneys office and the florida attorney generals office which 
are trying to determine whether she misused any of donations 
desillers has denied misusing the money and said about 150000 
was sent to her directly but had been mistakenly mingled in her 
sons account

democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis toured a general motors plant and campaigned among united 
auto workers today while continuing to woo supporters of former 
rival jesse jackson 
i dont care who you were with in the primary youre all 
democrats dukakis told a crowd of about 500 people when he 
arrived at the flint airport thursday night were going to win 
the state of michigan and win it decisively said dukakis who 
lost this states primary to jackson before running off a string of 
victories that secured the nomination 
today dukakis got a tour of the gm plant ending it by driving 
a new chevy blazer off the assembly line before meeting with the 
union workers from flint dukakis was headed to racine wis to 
visit a minorityowned technology company that has established 
retraining programs for its workers 
he arrived here after campaign stops in cleveland and secaucus 
nj taking time at both places to depart from his standard pledge 
of good jobs at good wages to step up his attack on the ethical 
standards of president reagan and vice president george bush 
particularly their support of attorney general edwin meese iii even 
after two top meese aides quit because of his legal troubles 
in a dukakis white house the ethics office will be in the 
oval office not some place down the hall dukakis said in a 
swipe at the handling of meeses troubles and bushs call for an 
ethics office in the white house 
dukakis also took time in ohio and new jersey to meet with 
prominent jackson supporters including newark mayor sharpe james 
and cleveland city council president george forbes 
also at the ohio meeting was arnold pinkney jacksons 1984 
campaign manager 
dukakis deputy field director donna brazile a jackson aide four 
years ago described the sessions as very positive and said the 
jackson supporters nearly all black had pledged their support to 
dukakis 
dukakis said the jackson backers were very enthused and ready 
to go to work 
james after a meeting with dukakis in newark said now we 
are ready to support michael dukakis he won fingering a 
campaign button on his lapel james added i have now replaced my 
jesse jackson button with a michael dukakis button were ready to 
win 
in ohio during a series of live and satellite television 
interviews dukakis faced questioning about his selection of texas 
sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate instead of the home state 
favorite there sen john glenn 
in the end i just felt that sen bentsen was the right 
choice he said 
he also interrupted his ohio campaigning to speak via satellite 
to the united food and commercial workers convention in san 
francisco promising that if elected he would appoint members to 
the national labor relations board sensitive to labor needs 
in that speech and his addresses to rallies in secaucus and 
cleveland dukakis repeated many of the themes of the speech he 
gave when he accepted the nomination at the democratic national 
convention in atlanta 
we can take the easy road the downhill road or we can put 
america on the path to greatness once again dukakis told the 
union conference 
at each stop he repeated his support for an increased minimum 
wage universal health care and a trade bill containing a provision 
providing advance notification for workers of plant closings 
and he said that despite economic growth during the reagan 
administration that prosperity has reached only the privileged 
few he predicted he would defeat bush in november because 
average americans are concerned about the countrys economic future 
you cannot build a strong economic future on a credit card 
dukakis said in cleveland we cannot continue to borrow and spend 
and borrow and spend to prosperity 
after the wisconsin stop dukakis was headed to illinois and 
kentucky he was to spend tonight in kentucky and attend events 
there and in north carolina on saturday before returning home

in what promises to be a minor revolution in 
national drinking habits the government has said pubs will be 
allowed to stay open all afternoon beginning aug 22 
the move the first major change in pub licensing laws in 
england and wales in 72 years was announced in the house of 
commons on thursday by home secretary douglas hurd 
the change does not apply to scotland where pubs have been open 
during the afternoons since 1977 under separate licensing laws 
parliament passed legislation approving the relaxation of 
licensing regulations in april but left it to the government to 
decide the date when pubs could start opening in the afternoon 
since 1916 pubs in england and wales have had to shut down 
after lunch and not open again until early evening the 1916 law 
was introduced to curb drinking by world war i munitions workers 
under the new law introduced largely as a result of pressure 
from the tourism industry pubs will be allowed to stay open from 
11 am to 11 pm on weekdays currently weekday hours are 11 am 
to 3 pm and in most cases 530 or 6 pm to 11 pm 
the change does not affect sunday pub hours which run noon 
until 3 pm and from 7 pm to 1030 pm 
the consumers association and the british tourist authority are 
among those who welcomed the relaxation of restrictions on drinking 
hours 
but the british medical association has said it fears an upsurge 
in alcoholrelated illness and road accidents

congress is getting ready to complete work on 
strengthening the endangered species act the worldwide standard 
for protecting plants and animals after a fouryear impasse was 
finally broken in the senate 
the way was cleared thursday when the senate voted 932 for 
bipartisan legislation that would give the 15yearold protection 
program more money and greater powers 
the action capped four years of efforts by the bills managers 
to bring the package to a floor vote until recently they had been 
blocked by a handful of senators questioning efforts to protect sea 
turtles and reintroduce wolves to yellowstone national park 
negotiators from the house and senate now must meet to resolve 
relatively minor differences between the senates bill and one 
passed 39916 by the house last december 
technically the endangered species program has been without 
legislative authorization since oct 1 1985 the protection effort 
has been financed year by year since then with some 39 million 
available this year 
the house and senate bills would authorize 56 million next 
year rising to 66 million in 1992 
the basic law enacted in 1973 prohibits trade in species 
considered endangered or threatened and requires the government to 
take affirmative steps to foster their survival and take no actions 
that would hasten their demise 
there are now nearly 1000 species on the fish and wildlife 
services endangeredthreatened list about 400 of them found in 
this country 
there are about 1000 species awaiting formal listing sen 
george mitchell dmaine floor manager of the senate bill said 
that at current spending levels it would take until 2020 to end 
this backlog 
environmentalists say some 80 species have become extinct while 
awaiting listing and that another 300 may have passed the point of 
no return the house and senate bills would require more intensive 
monitoring of the condition of species awaiting listing 
both bills would increase the civil and criminal penalties for 
violations of the protection law and attempt to close a loophole 
that has allowed the destruction of endangered plants on private 
property 
sen john chafee rri said that conservationists worldwide 
were watching the senate because the us law is a model for the 
entire world 
one of these rare species may hold the cure to cancer he 
said the extinction of a single species can be an act of the 
utmost recklessness extinction is an awesome act of finality 
mitchell called the plan a strong statement to our continuing 
commitment to protect these plants and animals on the brink of 
extinction 
the house passed a renewal bill in 1985 but it died because a 
handful of westerners were able to keep the issue off the senate 
floor this year western opposition centering on water rights and 
control of predators like wolves and grizzly bears was muted 
but southern lawmakers convinced mitchell to accept language 
that would delay the reagan administrations efforts to force 
shrimp fishermen to use devices to prevent dwindling numbers of sea 
turtles from being snared and drowned in their nets 
under the amendment offered by sen howell heflin dala 
turtle excluder devices would not be required in offshore waters 
before next may or in inshore waters before may 1990 in the 
interim the national academy of sciences would study factors 
affecting turtle mortality in the atlantic ocean and the gulf of 
mexico 
john fitzgerald of the defenders of wildlife said 
speciesprotection groups could live with the amendment which set 
up easy senate passage of the bill 
were confident the study will confirm that these turtles are 
highly endangered and that the devices are necessary he said 
the only no votes in the senate were cast by republicans 
steve symms of idaho and jake garn of utah

unless the scales of justice tip in 
his favor in the next few days an 800pound man unable to get out 
of bed will be evicted from his home hoisted by a forklift and 
hauled off on a flatbed trailer 
michael edelman who fell out of bed in december and needed a 
tow truck to get up lost an appeal of the eviction thursday 
his landlord ronald fish wants to level the dilapidated 
bungalow where edelman has lived with his mother for two years in 
order to redevelop the land for singlefamily homes in this suburb 
north of new york city 
edelmans attorney george rosenbaum says hell fight any 
attempt to use a forklift to remove his client he said edelman 
could be removed as early as next week 
my understanding is that if michael is touched and if they try 
to move him his health would be jeopardized rosenbaum said 
were putting the county and police on notice that to touch him 
would jeopardize his health 
ken seltman a spokesman for westchester county said the county 
probably will seek an independent physicians opinion before 
removing edelman 
the county concluded earlier that the best way to remove him 
would be to hoist him by forklift onto a highway department flatbed 
truck 
if this could hurt him well ask a judge what to do 
seltman said 
real estate agents have failed to find a place for the pair to 
live because of edelmans size the county also has unsuccessfully 
sought land for a trailer his landlord was willing to give him 
edelman 24 has been accepted into an obesity program at st 
lukes hospital in new york city but said he doesnt want to go 
because the program wont accept his mother who weighs about 400 
pounds

china officials said 
through it all americans will come to know china as few in 
the world ever have former president richard nixon said in a

shared with chinese officials 
the scope and quality of the exhibits are the greatest ever lent 
by the chinese government according to xie chengsheng of chinas 
ministry of culture 
nixon who normalized us relations with china in the early 
1970s wanted to attend todays opening but couldnt for health 
reasons said jeri mcdonald of son of heaven inc a local group 
that helped organize the exhibit 
the 74yearold former president who lives in saddle river 
nj had prostate surgery last month 
the exhibit which promoters say is four times larger than the

largely from archaeological discoveries and research in china since 
the communists took power in 1949 its treasures come from 21 
museums and institutions in eight provinces and beijing 
the exhibit at the seattle center coming soon after the success 
of the academy awardwinning movie the last emperor is

china in a time of great strength 
while not arranged chronologically the exhibit illustrates how 
emperors lived and ruled over 26 centuries from 221 bc until 1911 
among the treasures are a set of 26 bells from the 6th century 
bc robes only the emperor could wear paintings jewelry 
household items and a 2nd century jade burial suit believed to 
possess magical properties to preserve the body of the princess 
placed inside it for eternity 
the lifesize terra cotta figures four warriors and two horses 
were selected from thousands found near the famed tomb of qin 
shihuang di in xian in central china in 1974 
the exhibit was planned over nearly four years by the chinese 
overseas archaeological exhibition corp of beijing a division of

workers formed a human chain and 
waded into the niagara river rapids to rescue four people who clung 
to rocks 40 feet above the falls for about an hour after their boat 
capsized authorities said 
the four began drinking on the 26foot boat wednesday evening at 
a marina in chippawa ontario and were unaware they had drifted so 
close to horseshoe falls the celebrated 158foot drop on the 
canadian side of the border authorities said 
no one was steering said sgt james dugos of the niagara 
regional state parks police im very much surprised that all 
four people were saved he said 
the four abandoned the boat when it capsized 40 yards from the 
brink of the falls and were rescued early thursday suffering only 
bumps and scrapes the 130000 boat was swept over the falls and 
destroyed 
david shand 34 said he thought he and his companions would die 
as they clasped the rocks with the roar of the falls in their ears 
you had to be out there said the owner of the boat david 
mason 35 its like something you dream about in the middle of 
the night 
a camper in goat island state park heard the four screaming and 
called for help 
warning signs and the rapids of the upper niagara river usually 
discourage boaters from getting too close to the falls

a royal snafu has erupted over a dry 
cleaners insistence on using the nickname she has had since 
childhood lady di 
the british government frowns on anyone taking the royal 
familys names in vain including diana wife of prince charles 
and twice has asked diane storoni to rename her establishment in 
vista about 45 miles north of san diego 
its my name and im not going to change it for anybody 
said storoni who says her family has called her lady di since she 
was a baby thats that i personally dont think she the 
princess of wales cares about this 
angus mackay spokesman at the british consulate in los angeles 
said the names of members of the royal family are never used in 
commercial solicitation either in britain or anywhere in the 
world 
he also doesnt like the way storoni advertises her company as 
cleaners to the royal family the radio commercial features an 
impersonation of prime minister margaret thatcher 
the advertisement cheapens not only the royal family 
themselves but also the humanitarian values with which they are so 
closely associated around the world mackay wrote in a june 14 
letter 
mackay said the consulate has received several letters from 
local residents offended by the ads 
he said a british company can advertise that it provides goods 
or services to the royal family only if designated by appointment 
to the royal family 
we simply wanted to make the company aware of all of that 
he said and its really up to the company to decide what they 
want to do we certainly dont intend to take it any further 
but storoni does she wants to open a lady di plant in london 
next year 
and for anyone who is offended her business partner gennaro 
marinelli said perhaps you might suggest a little less starch 
in their laundry

president reagan approved a 30day extension 
of secret service protection for jesse jackson at a cost of 
roughly 600000 because of jacksons concerns regarding threats 
against his life reagans spokesman said today 
marlin fitzwater said the president would not approve extension 
of the protection through the fall election campaign 
reagans decision authorized an extension from the day after the 
democratic national convention concluded to aug 22 
fitzwater said jacksons request for an extension was based on 
his assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an 
active participant in the campaign 
jacksons secret service protection technically was to have been 
withdrawn on july 22 after his presidential candidacy ended with 
the democratic nomination of gov michael dukakis of massachusetts 
but fitzwater said the protection had been maintained without 
interruption while reagan weighed whether to approve the extension 
fitzwater said the 30day extension would give jackson a 
transition period in which to arrange for private bodyguards 
the feeling was that first of all hes not the nominee of 
the party the spokesman said 
however he said there had been precedents for extending normal 
secret service protection for government officials because of 
extenuating circumstances

michael dukakis courted bluecollar voters and jesse jackson 
supporters today in michigan a state that jackson won during the 
primary season as vice president george bush made another push for 
his childcare plan and continued his search for a running mate 
dukakis running mate lloyd bentsen was on a solo voyage for the 
democratic ticket wooing independentminded westerners whose 
suspicion of big government previously drew them to president 
reagan 
in washington reagan approved a 30day extension of secret 
service protection for jackson at a cost that reagans spokesman 
estimated at 600000 he said the protection would end aug 22 
marlin fitzwater said jacksons request was based on his 
assessments of threats against his life and his plan to be an 
active participant in the campaign 
dukakis toured a general motors plant in flint driving a chevy 
blazer off the assembly line and then spoke to several hundred 
united auto workers many of them laid off from other plants 
outside their union hall 
he said full employment would be his no 1 priority as 
president and he told the autoworkers that something must be done 
about the hard times that have lingered in parts of the nation as 
the economy has recovered on both coasts 
if theres one thing i want to do as president of the united 
states its to bring those kind of jobs and that kind of future to 
every community in the united states he said you need a 
president who will work with you a president who wont settle for 
secondbest or secondrate 
bush told reporters today that he expects to select a running 
mate before the republican national convention next month in new 
oreleans but i will keep my own counsel on the selection 
while saying that his choice for the no 2 spot on the gop 
ticket was important bush said i really believe the election 
will be decided at the presidential level 
asked whether there were any prospective running mates left to 
be contacted by him bush said maybe 
the vice president spoke with reporters as he toured a 
companysponsored child care center in tysons corner va near 
washington 
bush who has proposed a 1000perchild tax credit primarily 
aimed at lowincome working mothers voiced opposition to a 25 
billion democratic child care plan that gives the federal 
government a more direct role 
i am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse 
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricksandmortar 
child care program thats going to be effective you have to have 
choice parental choice family choice and you have to have 
diversity bush said 
dukakis who lost michigan to jackson but went on to secure the 
nomination with a string of primary victories said to a crowd of 
about 500 people when he arrived in flint thursday night i dont 
care who you were with in the primary youre all democrats 
also in michigan today john jacob president of the national 
urban league said in detroit that bush had declined an invitation 
to address next weeks league conference dukakis will appear 
before the group monday night and jesse jackson will speak 
wednesday 
as for bushs running mate the vice president says he hopes to 
have a tentative list completed by weeks end but plans to delay 
his final selection until the republican national convention on 
aug 1518 the process is going along in an orderly fashion 
he said thursday 
those reached include former rivals sen bob dole of kansas and 
rep jack kemp of new york doles wife former transportation 
secretary elizabeth dole and several whose names did not figure in 
earlier speculation among those are sen dan quayle rind 
campaign sources said bushs list to date also includes sens 
pete v domenici rnm alan k simpson rwyo william l 
armstrong rcolo john danforth rmo and nancy l kassebaum 
rkan govs thomas h kean of new jersey john sununu of new 
hampshire carroll a campbell of south carolina and george 
deukmejian of california and former govs lamar alexander of 
tennessee and richard thornburg of pennsylvania who recently was 
nominated by president reagan to be attorney general 
bentsen in a speech thursday in reno nev told the national 
conference of state legislators if there is one lesson we have 
learned in recent years it is that the federal government cant 
solve all of the nations problems 
mindful of dukakis promise of an activist government he added 
but washington can lead 
jackson no longer a presidential candidate returned to his 
brand of diplomacy saying he has asked the united nations 
secretarygeneral to ask iranian officials for assistance in 
freeing us hostages held by iranian sympathizers in lebanon 
dukakis said he was unfamiliar with the facts about jacksons 
effort but as a general matter private citizens should not try 
to conduct foreign policy 
dukakis postconvention high in the polls continued thursday 
as a harris poll gave him an 18point lead over bush but pollster 
louis harris said such a wide margin was likely to be temporary 
harris survey of 1268 likely voters found 57 percent support 
for dukakis to 39 percent for bush it was the fourth national poll 
since the democratic convention last week to find a dukakis lead of 
that magnitude 
the new harris poll was done july 2225 and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points

new image for the lounge connected to its hotel it sometimes 
discourages group meeting planners from selecting the lansing

the club which opened in 1982 was the last holdout in a 
28year tradition franchises in des moines and omaha closed at the 
end of april while playboy enterprises inc shut down all the 
clubs it owned in 1986 
nearly 30 playboy clubs sprang up around the united states after 
playboy publisher hugh hefner opened the first in chicago in 1960 
every club followed the hefner formula waitresses served drinks 
while perched on spike heels and squeezed into figurehugging 
strapless lowcut satin costumes accessorized with tuxedo collars 
cuffs fluffy white tails and bunny ears 
playboy bunnies were trained to serve drinks by dipping 
demurely rather than bending over 
when he closed the playboyowned clubs hefner said they had 
become passe and too tame for the times 
after tonight anyone interested in patronizing a playboy club 
will have to go to the orient 
the lansing club had a reunion thursday of all the playboy 
bunnies who ever served cocktails there 
tonight a reunion is planned for the people who were 
cardcarrying club members before low attendance forced the owners 
to throw away the key cards and let anyone in business has been 
so slow club manager jeff collar said 
on saturday club memorabilia will be auctioned for charity 
the closing announced earlier this month gave both the club 
and hotel a boost as former customers curiosity seekers and 
reporters descended to witness the end of an era 
the bunnies are getting pretty good at interviews collar

surgeon general c everett koop said today the 
nation should mobilize resources to fight tobacco addiction as it 
has to fight illicit drugs 
we should give tobacco use and tobacco addiction the serious 
attention it deserves koop told a house subcommittee our 
nation has mobilized enormous resources to wage a war on drugs 
illicit drugs 
we should also give priority to the one addiction tobacco 
addiction that is killing more than 300000 americans each 
year he said 
koop testified before the house energy and commerce subcommittee 
on health and the environment on a 618page report he issued in may 
in which he said careful examination of the data makes it clear 
that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting an 
extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is the drug in 
tobacco that causes addiction 
moreover the processes that determine tobacco addiction are 
similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin 
and cocaine he wrote 
charles o whitley representing the tobacco institute said 
to call smoking an addiction trivializes and almost mocks the 
serious narcotic and other hard drug problems faced by our society 
and undermines efforts to combat drug abuse 
whitley said that koop proclaimed in 1982 that young people are 
addicted to video games 
the escalation of antismoking rhetoric by the surgeon general 
in his latest report is similarly without medical or scientific 
foundation as a number of public health officials have 
recognized and as the 41 million americans who have topped smoking 
attest he said 
koop told the house subcommittee that more than 2000 scientific 
articles were reviewed in preparing the report 
koop told the panel that tobacco like other addictions can be 
treated effectively 
a wide variety of behavorial interventions have been used for 
years he said in recognition of the important role that 
nicotine plays in maintaining tobacco use nicotine replacement 
therapy is now available 
nicotine gum has been shown to relieve withdrawal symptoms 
following smoking cessation and may enhance the effectiveness of 
behaviorial treatments he said 
national surveys indicate that 75 percent to 85 percent of 
smokers would like to quit he said 
more than 40 million americans have been able to quit smoking 
despite the addiction koop told the subcommittee for many 
smokers a genuine desire to quit and if necessary persistent and 
repeated attempts to quit may be all that is necessary for others 
selfhelp materials formal treatment programs and nicotine 
replacement therapy may be needed 
whitley said koops report is a political document 
its conclusions conform with the surgeon generals political 
goal of a smokeless society and undoubtedly were reached long 
before the report was drafted he told the committee by 
branding cigarette smoking an addiction a term with deeply 
pejorative moral and social connotations the surgeon general 
obviously hopes to strengthen the antismoking cause generally and 
by his own admissions hopes to make it easier for plaintiffs to 
prevail in tobacco product liability cases

party central committee opened today on practical work to 
implement the decisions of the 19th allunion conference of the 
party which called this month for reform 
a spokesman at the central committees information department 
confirmed shortly after 6 pm that the meeting had finished its 
work but declined to say what orders the policymaking body issued 
or whether any changes were made to the ruling 13man politburo 
you will have to wait for the official announcements said 
the committee spokesman he spoke on condition he not be identified 
western and soviet sources had predicted that at least one 
longstanding member of the leadership would tender his resignation 
at the gathering perhaps setting a precedent for orderly 
retirement from the ruling body where members have traditionally 
served for life or been voted out in disgrace 
 
the politburo decided july 4 to call together the central 
committees more than 300 members it said then it was preparing 
proposals for the committee on implementing reforms of the 
political system the democratization of party state and social 
life 
resolutions on major changes in soviet government institutions 
and internal party practices were adopted by a 5000delegate 
national party conference that met in the kremlin june 28july 1 
revamped institutions of central government are to be in place 
by next spring the conference said the party also has been 
ordered to review the qualifications of each of its 20 million 
members this year 
gorbachev the partys general secretary says the soviet union 
must transform itself into a country ruled by law to prevent a 
lapse into the repression of the stalin years and the corruption 
and stagnation allowed under president leonid i brezhnev 
the conference resolutions call for broad and varied changes 
ranging from an end to bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to a 
declaration that citizens should have access to all information not 
classified as military or state secrets 
the conference also ordered the party to get out of the business 
of running the economy and government administration and to 
concentrate on setting the ideological agenda of the nations 284 
million citizens 
but the documents adopted unanimously by the delegates usually 
speak only in general terms of gorbachevs goals for political 
reform the central committee is expected to flesh them out and 
come up with a specific timetable and methods to implement them 
the committee also is empowered to make changes in the politburo 
and the secretariat the top party body that runs the countrys 
daytoday affairs but no reshuffling of the top kremlin 
leadership is expected 
the last central committee plenum on may 23 did not make any 
personnel changes but at its previous session on feb 1718 the 
central committee removed former gorbachev protege boris n yeltsin 
from his nonvoting seat on the politburo yeltsin had been fired 
as moscow party leader in november 
the plenum also might shed light on gorbachevs proposal for a 
powerful new presidency the post apparently is designed for 
gorbachev himself whose job as party chief now makes him the no 1 
figure in the collective kremlin leadership 
the soviet presidency held by former foreign minister andrei a 
gromyko now is a largely ceremonial post gorbachev asked that the 
office also include control over domestic international and 
defense policies 
but there was no mention of those powers in the official 
documents adopted by the party conference

greek and american negotiators today 
wrapped up an eighth round of talks on a new us military bases 
agreement to replace an accord that expires in december 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said the negotiations 
were held in a professional atmosphere but added that there 
continued to be a difference of views on the issues being 
discussed 
negotiations for a new us base agreement are moving more 
slowly than us officials would like 
on july 13 the government issued a formal shutdown notice for 
all us military bases operating in greece the notice a legal 
formality is not expected to result in any of the bases being 
closed 
premier andreas papandreou insists that the united states should 
help solve greekturkish disputes over military control of the 
aegean and the divided island of cyprus in return for a new base 
agreement 
but the united states doesnt want to link a new accord with 
regional politics 
kostopoulos described as completely inaccurate a report in 
janes defence weekly that us air base facilites in athens would 
be transferred to souda bay in crete 
according to the report the united states agreed to remove the 
us air force base from hellenikon airport and transfer it to 
souda bay in crete as part of an alternative solution 
since the 1950s the united states has operated four military 
bases in greece two near athens and two on the southern island of 
crete as a form of rent for the bases greece receives more than 
300 million yearly in us military credits 
papandreou who came to power in 1981 pledging to shut down the 
american bases now says his socialist government is willing to 
sign a new agreement provided it is first approved in a referendum 
further negotiations are scheduled for september in athens 
kostopoulos said

police today ordered the film 
cry freedom seized from theaters across the country hours 
after the government gave permission for it to be shown 
police commissioner hendrik de witt issued the order in the 
evening under state of emergency regulations the order came less 
than nine hours after the publication appeals board the 
governments censorship body announced the film could be shown 
cry freedom endangers the safety of the public the 
maintenance of public order and will delay the termination of the 
25month state of emergency de witt said in a statement he 
said the film contained propagandistic elements likely to 
encourage unrest and was biased against police 
thirty theaters began showing the movie this morning a half 
hour after permission was granted the first showing at a downtown 
johannesburg cinema attracted about 200 viewers white and black 
to a 350seat theater 
blacks in the audience cried and sang along with the soundtrack 
at various emotional scenes during the film several left the 
theater in tears 
moviegoers said police began arriving at theaters in the 
evening with orders to confiscate the film 
the publications appeals board ruled that the film about the 
friendship between biko and white journalist donald woods could be 
shown uncut to viewers at least 19 years old 
later the justice ministry noted that it had not given 
permission to quote woods as actor kevin kline does in the film 
because of woods banned status under national law 
there were explosions at two theaters where the film was to be 
shown police said there were no injuries at either of the 
theaters the kings cinema in the alexandra township outside 
johannesburg and the metro theater in downtown durban authorities 
said 
police reported bomb threats at theaters in durban pretoria 
and port elizabeth 
cry freedom had been scheduled to open today after 
government censors last november approved showing it without cuts 
or age restrictions but home affairs minister stoffel botha on 
monday ordered the board to reconsider he did not give a reason 
the movie directed by richard attenborough and filmed in 
neighboring zimbabwe stars denzel washington as biko and kline as 
woods 
biko died in 1977 in police custody after founding and promoting 
the black consciousness movement in south africa 
kobus van rooyen head of the censorship board called the film 
a mediocre product that had obvious and blatant bias against 
the south african police 
but he added the board came to the conclusion that the film 
does not present a risk to race relations or to the security of the 
state 
the script is based on two books by woods who fled fled the 
country after bikos death 
some black youths said they were let out of school to see the 
film 
its a good film if whites could see it maybe they would 
change their minds said one black teenager who saw it 
the brutalities and all those things in the film happened to 
us said the youth who spoke on condition of anonymity 
rightwing whites labeled the film leftist propaganda some 
blacks criticized it saying it overemphasizes bikos association 
with woods 
no one was officially found responsible for bikos death and 
the film does not portray what happened to him in police custody 
after his arrest for violating a banning order that restricted him 
to his home in port elizabeth 
but biko is shown unconscious bruised frothing at the mouth 
lying naked and handcuffed in a cell the film shows policemen 
tossing him naked into the back of a truck and his head knocking 
against the floor as he is driven hundreds of miles to pretoria 
where he died in the prison hospital 
those details are all based on evidence at the inquest into his 
death 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

the chief of a rocket fuel plant 
destroyed in an explosion may 4 says he will contest 36455 in 
fines for 30 alleged safety violations 
the nevada division of occupational safety and health is seeking 
the fines against pacific engineering and production co the blast 
killed two employees at a henderson plant injured 326 others and 
caused about 73 million in damage 
the fines were disclosed thursday by joseph kirkbride 
information director for the us department of labors regional 
office in san francisco under state law the nevada agency is 
barred from discussing the case 
fred gibson chairman and chief executive officer for the 
company called the allegations wholly without merit all of 
them based on unsubstantiated allegations that have not yet been 
proven 
we have asked for the evidence and whatever other data these 
charges are based on dosh has absolutely refused to furnish us 
anything he added 
we understand these charges are based on interviews subsequent 
to the may 4 explosion so there is no evidence other than the 
allegations 
gibson said the company will contest the fines before an 
occupational safety and health review panel and if ncessary in 
court 
company executives blamed the explosion on a leaking natural gas 
line that ran under the plant but the clark county fire department 
said earlier this month that it was sparked by a welders torch 
fire chief roy parrish said 85 million pounds of ammonium 
perchlorate a fuel oxidizer used in the space shuttle and military 
missiles was destroyed in the series of blasts at the plant 20 
miles from las vegas 
the charges include four willful violations such a exposing 
employees to possible fire or explosion through a lack of 
manufacturing controls and operating procedures kirkbride said 
the state also charged a lack of emergency evacuation and 
response procedures inadequate access to respirators and a lack of 
entry procedures exposed workers to potentially hazardous levels of 
toxic fumes suffocation and death

the ranks of the elite texas rangers will 
be joined in september by a lawman believed to be the first black 
to serve in the 165yearold peacekeeping force the department of 
public safety says 
i feel pretty good its been an ambition of mine for many 
years said lee roy young jr 41 a 14year dps veteran who 
currently is an investigator assigned to the criminal intelligence 
service in san antonio 
dps officers also known as state troopers have duties similar 
to state police or highway patrolmen in other states 
the rangers also within the dps are an elite force assigned to 
major crimes such as hostagetakings or longstanding murder 
investigations they also are called on by authorities in small 
towns and less populated counties for help with homicides 
rangers have a good reputation and are highly trained dps 
spokesman david wells said thursday but the dps has been dogged by 
charges of racial discrimination in recent years there are five 
hispanic rangers and no women rangers wells said the national 
association for the advancement of colored people has threatened to 
sue 
michael scott a black state trooper from houston last year 
publicly voiced disappointment when he wasnt selected for the 
rangers 
im happy for mr young this is a step in right direction for 
him and his career im disappointed for michael scott because he 
really is the person who brought all this to bear said gary 
bledsoe president of the austin naacp branch 
it appears there would be a policy in the department saying 
were going to start promoting a few people because we have to but 
were going to promote people who dont complain or stand up for 
their rights people who play by the rules of the game bledsoe 
said 
young and three white dps officers will join the 94man rangers 
unit in august and september wells said ranger candidates first 
must pass a written test high scorers then undergo an interview by 
a board of six dps supervisors 
theres a certain mystique about the texas rangers its a 
highly soughtafter job in the department and many people have to 
apply many times most do before theyre successful said col 
leo gossett dps director 
wells said the reason there hasnt been a black ranger before is 
that young was the first black to reach the required level in the 
testing theyre all treated the same on the testing procedures 
theres no difference he said 
while parts of the rangers history are sketchy young is 
believed to be the first black to formally be included in the ranks 
the rangers trace their history to the days when texas still 
belonged to mexico stephen f austin in 1823 employed 10 men to 
serve as rangers 
the texas rangers may have been thought of as operating 
against indians and mexican raiders in the early years and later 
against outlaw bands feudists stock thieves and local rioters 
says a history in the authoritative handbook of texas 
in 1935 the rangers were reorganized and placed in the dps and 
now are stationed in towns across the state

new moves by the communist north and 
capitalist south to ease their hostility and work out an agreement 
on the olympic games are being viewed with great caution and little 
hope 
south koreas national assembly has accepted a proposal from 
north korea for interparliamentary talks on a nonaggression pact 
the north also agreed to discuss participating in the olympics 
which would end a potential threat to the games scheduled for 
september in seoul 
contacts would begin in august if terms can be worked out the 
south wants preliminary talks about an agenda but the north calls 
that a waste of time 
some south koreans hope for a breakthrough to peaceful relations 
or reconciliation one national assembly spokesman said our 
position is that we would try to accomodate the norths demand as 
much as possible 
hopes that talks could remove any north korean threat to the 
olympics may be premature the north has not dropped its key demand 
to be cohost of the olympics holding some events on its 
territory and may hope to force concessions 
a north korean agreement to drop its cohosting demand and take 
part in the olympics would be a stunning reversal of its position 
north korea may be initiating talks in order to disrupt the 
olympics by fostering uncertainty and tension up to opening day 
the talks could become another test of nerves in a contest that has 
occupied the rival koreas since the peninsula was divided at the 
end of world war ii 
past negotiations failed to ease tension the last talks 
collapsed in 1986 when the north pulled out in protest of routine 
ussouth korean military exercises 
the olympics are a pawn in the struggle for supremacy on the 
peninsula and the north wants to be cohost in order to avoid 
losing ground 
each side claims to be the nations sole legitimate government 
they refuse to recognize each other and south korea views the award 
of the 24th olympic games games as world recognition of its 
supremacy 
the international olympic committee rejects the norths demand 
to be cohost saying the games are awarded to a single city and 
cannot be shared 
north korea says the olympics were awarded to the nation and the 
two sides can work out a cohosting agreement it rejected a 
compromise under which it could stage up to five of the sports if 
it dropped the cohost demand 
in proposing negotiations the government in pyongyang may be 
seeking a facesaving reason for not participating in the games it 
could accuse the south of preventing a unified olympics and claim 
to have sought a solution until the last moment 
south korea agreed to the talks because of its desire to ease 
tension and protect the olympics from disruption or violence 
officials in seoul believe any kind of talks reduce the threat 
many terrorist actions against south korea have been blamed on 
the north it was implicated in the nov 29 bombing of a south 
korean airliner which killed all 115 people aboard 
olympic and south korean officials acknowledge privately that 
even a small border clash in the next few weeks could frighten away 
participants and spectators the border is less than 50 miles from 
seoul 
pyongyang has claimed south korea and the united states are 
using the olympics to conceal preparations for a nuclear war and 
there are no signs that kim il sungs regime has abandoned its 
desire to reunite the peninsula under communist rule 
kim who started the korean war by invading the south in 1950 
said again thursday that the olympics threaten the north 
the united states is reinforcing massive armed forces in and 
around south korea on the plea of guaranteeing olympic safety 
and at the instigation of the united states the south korean 
authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever to keep our 
nation divided forever he declared

the cream of frances haute couture designers 
showed off clothes that were both youthful and beautiful in the 
fallwinter collection the week of showings brought lots of good 
news for fashionwatchers including cheery colors to brighten up 
winter 
after the hue and cry about the miniskirt hem lengths are 
dropping somewhat as designers realize that teeny skirts look 
ridiculous in couture clothes 
a few hemlines sank to midcalf length at chanel cardin 
feraud givenchy but most skirts came out hovering around the 
kneecap or just above and there was new attention to dressy pants 
marc bohan at dior on thursday won the weeks official award 
the golden thimble for his youthful yet chic collection 
many who had seen the shows thought yves saint laurent deserved 
a prize for his superb collection of perfectlyexecuted clothes 
but pierre berge president of saint laurent has steadfastly 
refused the golden thimble 
only a few thousand women worldwide can afford couture clothes 
which often cost 6000 and range up to 25000 for an elaborately 
beaded evening gown 
besides pleasing these women couturiers have another purpose in 
turning out a collection couture clothes serve as models for good 
readytowear and boost the designers fame and name for the big 
money stakes accessory and perfume licenses 
suits made news in the shows well shaped with waist emphasis 
and enough shoulder padding to give jackets style without looking 
hulky bohans suits at dior were based on short skirts and 
snuglyfitted jackets with a martingale belt feature in back 
todays couturiers know that many of their best clients keep in 
shape have facelifts and look young so they dont have to worry 
too much about the portly mrs gotrocks types that cropped up 50 
years ago or so and their clothes are geared to slim women 
saint laurents easilyfitted piped suede suits came out in 
glorious color combinations like turquoise and french blue 
shocking pink and raspberry chartreuse and rust 
jeanlouis scherrers most artistic suede suits were the 
ultimate in luxury many were painted with landscapes others had a 
cutout eyelet effect 
trousers recently the domain of readytowear made a strong 
reentry even christian lacroix gave up his littlegirl bouffant 
skirts to soften his general lines which included some palazzo or 
skirtpants the best appeared as a highwaisted tuxedo outfit 
with a flowing back on the cutaway jacket 
saint laurents striking group of tuxedo styles including 
straight and uncomplicated pants were a reminder that borrowing 
menswear in the right way can make women look fabulous 
couture showed plenty of coats for keeping warm in pampered 
comfort the top furs such as astrakhan mink sable and fox were 
often dyed everything from pastel to hot orange shades a nice 
extra fashion touch for the women who are bored with their plain 
old natural sables or lynx 
the broadcloth cashmere or mohair coats were beautifully cut 
very fitted in long or short redingotes or princess coats 
seveneighths shortie coats and full trapezeline models 
lateday clothes looked rich and alluring as couturiers let 
their fantasies go wild plunging decolletes and strapless cocktail 
or short evening gowns sometimes had elegant little boleros or 
jackets for a discreet entrance to the party 
the renaissance and tudor periods inspired some designers 
lanvins furtrimmed taffeta gowns were striking enough for a film 
set karl lagerfeld at chanel used pageboy velvet knickers or long 
skirts ruffed white collars and cuffs chains and jewels in his 
historical flights of fancy clothes 
coutures long gowns were stunning in iridescent taffeta as 
well as combinations of velvet and moire lace and tulle satin 
evening pajamas and dinner dresses were the options for informal 
evenings 
the colors on runways were lively enough to warm even the most 
jaded fashion writers heart many designers have fallen in love 
with lavender and amethyst using it both for day and evening 
besides silvery grey and autumn colors like pinky brick rust 
forest green and raspberry there was a lot of chocolate brown 
cafe au lait and cinnamon 
designers didnt stop at regular fall colors they also went 
into sunny yellow bright sapphire poppy and carnation red 
emerald blazing orange electric pink fuschia and cerise 
especially in lateday clothes 
even though the vast majority of women cant even contemplate 
buying these couture clothes they can serve as references for 
style and color when looking through the racks and those lucky 
enough to afford the couturiers readytowear clothes shown in 
march and already on their way to the shops might find cuts and 
fabrics to echo couture quality 
just after the shows american designer patrick kelly threw a 
coutureandgardenia party for the fashion crowd in his workshop in 
the historical marais district 
dressed in his favorite gear baggy overalls and loud red 
basketball shoes kelly was jovially pinning gardenias on the 
women and posing with live models and dummy mannequins wearing 
haute couture clothes hed created stitched charcoal grey 
outfits and one striking green and black satin gown 
id like to turn out a whole couture collection twice a year 
and be accepted as a member of the haute couture branch of the 
chambre syndicale he said but i was very glad to be accepted 
into the french federation of readytowear creators

couples who live together are more likely 
than married couples to be involved in violent conflicts possibly 
because married partners have a greater emotional investment in the 
relationship a study says 
the study by university of new hampshire professors murray 
straus and jan stets found violence occurred among 35 percent of 
the 237 cohabiting couples surveyed 14 percent of the 5005 
married couples and 20 percent of the 526 dating couples 
every kind of intimate relationship has a risk of violence 
straus said thursday 
cohabiting couples often are socially isolated lacking the 
network of relatives that many married couples rely on to help 
resolve conflicts he said they also lack the material and 
emotional investment of married couples he said 
though both married and cohabiting couples may share a high 
level of conflict from living together a married couple is more 
likely to shun violence to avoid risking the relationship and 
losing the investment he said 
about twothirds of the violence involved slapping throwing 
objects pushing or shoving he said some violent episodes were 
more severe involving kicking and punching 
the findings will be presented to the american sociological 
association conference aug 25 in atlanta

foreign minister but not with iraqs envoy 
be patient he told reporters and we will make progress 
rather soon i am constantly in touch with the parties i keep 
working 
perez de cuellar said he would speak to foreign minister tariq 
aziz of iraq when he needs to see him 
aziz has not met perez de cuellar since their first two meetings 
wednesday when aziz stated that there could be no ceasefire in 
the iraniraq war without direct talks with iran

iraq before a ceasefire

said the talks are faltering over iraqs insistence on direct talks 
un officials said a un team of military experts would arrive 
in baghdad tonight to work out details for a ceasefire the team 
has been in tehran 
iran and iraq accused each other thursday of blocking the un 
efforts to end their 8yearold war 
perez de cuellar acknowledged an impasse and when asked if he 
had a formula for breaking it said im working on that but 
he added at some stage direct talks are indispensable 
un negotiations toward ending the war are being conducted 
under security council resolution 598 which iraq agreed to soon 
after it was adopted in july last year but which iran did not 
accept until this month 
it provides for a ceasefire followed by withdrawal to 
recognized borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an 
investigation of which side started the war 
the policy of iraq is to put obstacles in the way of the 
secretarygenerals peace efforts said mohammad javad zarif 
counselor at irans un mission this whole iraqi exercise is 
planned to sabotage the efforts upon which the international 
community is looking with hope 
velayati accepted all of perez de cuellars proposals on 
implementing the peace plan iraq has not yet responded and 
details of the proposals have not been disclosed 
iraqs un mission accused iran of simply seeking a hasty 
truce without giving any commitments that it will comply honestly 
and sincerely to the full implementation of the resolution as a 
plan for comprehensive and durable peace

inside iran iraq which says it has withdrawn from iranian 
territory describes the invaders as iranian rebels but iran says 
they are iraqi troops

minister summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent security 
council members united states soviet union china britain and 
france and insisted on a peace treaty 
this is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement of the 
war iraqi television quoted him as saying 
but he added that iraq is for an early immediate ceasefire 
as a means to end the war within the framework of a comprehensive 
peace settlement 
pressure was increasing on iraq in the 15member security 
council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that 
could prolong the fighting said un diplomats who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
velayati and aziz did not visit un headquarters thursday 
perez de cuellar suspended talks for a day to study his exchanges 
with the iraqi and iranian envoys since tuesday 
perez de cuellar said he hoped iranian officials are 
reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some 
stage but said he cannot compel the two sides to do so if iran 
is unwilling

syndicated columnist carl rowan a longtime 
advocate of tougher handgun controls will be arraigned monday on 
charges of using an unregistered handgun to shoot a teenager who 
took an uninvited dip in his back yard pool 
rowan will be arraigned on two misdemeanor charges possession 
of an unregistered gun and possession of unregistered ammunition 
in connection with the june 14 incident at his northwest washington 
home 
he was charged wednesday in district of columbia superior court 
court records show 
beverly burke a spokeswoman for the district governments legal 
division confirmed today that city officials had decided a day 
earlier to press the charges each of which carries a maximum 
penalty of a 1000 fine and a year in jail 
rowan 62 was cleared last month of assault charges in the 
shooting incident after an investigation by the federal 
prosecutors office but us attorney jay stephens said at the 
time that he believed rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an 
unregistered handgun 
stephens deferred that decision to the city which normally 
handles such cases 
rowan who has frequently written columns calling for strict 
restrictions on handgun use refused to comment on the matter when 
contacted by the associated press today in reno nev 
my lawyers are doing all the talking i dont know all the 
details yet said rowan who was scheduled to speak before the 
national conference of state legislatures 
after the shooting incident progun groups said rowan was being 
hypocritical for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice 
numerous times in his column rowan said he obtained the weapon 
after receiving death threats 
the districts farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that 
all weapons be registered 
but rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son 
carl jr a former fbi agent and that his son was told he did not 
have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau 
rowan said the shooting occurred after he heard noises in his 
back yard called police and then discovered benjamin smith 18 
of chevy chase md and three other youths by his pool 
rowan said he shot smith after the teenager lunged at him 
smith disputed that saying he had not threatened the columnist and 
had been shot while trying to flee 
smith who was wounded in the wrist was treated and released 
the same day from georgetown university hospital he was charged 
with one count of unlawful entry but prosecutors dropped the 
misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service

missouri voters decide tuesday 
whether to raise the jackpot limit on their struggling lottery and 
whether to give former first lady betty hearnes a chance to be the 
states first female governor 
in other primaries rep richard gephardt who filed at the last 
minute for a seventh term after dropping his presidential bid 
faces three littleknown democrats several candidates from both 
parties had entered the race for the 3rd district which includes 
part of st louis and its suburbs but most of the democrats bowed 
out when gephardts plans changed 
and democratic farm activist wayne cryts will try to win his 
partys nomination for the 8th district congressional seat that 
would entitle him to a rematch with republican rep bill emerson 
who won by 8000 out of 150000 votes cast in 1986 
in 1981 cryts gained national attention by taking 32000 
bushels of his familys soybeans out of a grain elevator that went 
into bankruptcy and was padlocked 
cryts is expected to easily knock off his three primary 
opponents 
mrs hearnes 61 who paints herself as a compassionate friend 
of working missourians is considered the democrats best bet for 
unseating republican gov john ashcroft 
shes expected to face little trouble with her only primary 
opposition lavoy zaki reed a st louis area teacher who is 
making his second bid for governor 
sure lightning could strike and something could happen but 
the democrats dont seem to have much of a primary fight said 
todd patterson executive director of the missouri democratic 
party i just cant imagine betty and wayne not winning 
mrs hearnes husband warren served as governor during 
196573 she was first elected to the state house in 1979 she has 
the backing of party regulars and has already launched a television 
campaign 
primary races have been overshadowed by campaigns for key 
constitutional amendments that will be on the primary ballot 
one would remove most spending restrictions on missouris 
2yearold lottery a change supporters call crucial in light of a 
24 million drop in sales during the last fiscal year officials 
say the decline was probably caused by a lack of advertising 
current restrictions require that 45 percent of lottery proceeds 
go for prizes 45 percent to the state and 10 percent for 
administrative costs including advertising 
critics say the 45 percent prize limit does not allow the 
lottery to compete with neighboring states with higher prize 
structures the amendment would change the prize limit to a minimum 
of 45 percent and lottery officials would like to give out about 
50 percent in prizes it would also permit the state to spend more 
on advertising 
another constitutional change would reduce from twothirds to 
foursevenths the vote majority needed to pass bond issues for 
street and bridge repairs schools and other facilities 
supporters say missouri is one of only five states that require 
the twothirds majority which they say unfairly limits school 
districts and cities in their abililty to make improvements 
in five of missouris six statewide offices up for election this 
year republican incumbents such as ashcroft and sen john 
danforth face no primary opposition 
and although neither danforth nor his democratic challenger 
state sen jay nixon face primary opposition the race has turned 
into one of the hottest of the summer as nixon tries to chip away 
at danforths support 
one of the most crowded primary races is the shootout going on 
in southwest missouris 7th district congressional district where 
four republicans and three democrats are running to replace 
retiring rep gene taylor a republican 
about 900000 voters or onethird of the states registered 
voters are expected to go to the polls tuesday

the peasant woman crouched in 
the lamplight and whispered bitter tales of sheltering her sons 
from sandinista army recruiters and heeding the demands of the 
antigovernment rebels 
she said she wants to survive in this remote southern mountain 
village where soldiers from both camps in nicaraguas sixyear 
civil war pass through the steep paths leaving their mark upon the 
lives of the peasants 
we have to get along with both sides just to be able to 
live the woman said she and a dozen relatives gathered around a 
homemade kerosene lamp in her tworoom wooden house 
we try to avoid both even though the contras in these parts 
dont recruit by force but the sandinistas do she said 
the woman her relatives and neighbors spoke over the course of 
two days to a reporter visiting this rugged village 185 miles 
southeast of managua casa de tabla is accessible only by foot or 
horse along steep hills and narrow paths kneehigh in mud most of 
the year 
they told their stories on the condition their names not be used 
for fear of revenge by the leftist sandinistas or the rebels known 
as contras 
the sovietsupplied sandinista troops and the ussupported 
rebels agreed to suspend military operations four months ago 
residents say the recruitment continues and the fighting has grown 
less frequent but has not stopped 
the 49yearold woman knows the effects of vengeance firsthand 
contras killed her husband and eldest son sandinista rockets 
struck her home killing her cousin and injuring four of her 
children 
the poor peasants in casa de tabla like many others in isolated 
battle zones express their helplessness at being caught between 
two armies their allegiance lies with the latest group trudging 
through carrying guns 
the residents of the village said they dont sympathize with 
either side they just want to be left alone 
the contras from the southern front dominate the area and have 
major base camps nearby the government doesnt that means the 
rebels are known in the village while the sandinista soldiers are 
strangers 
the contras pass through demanding civilian support which 
usually means feeding passing troops 
if someone comes to my house with a rifle and asks for coffee 
can i say no of course not one resident said you see what 
happens to us peasants who just want to work if we give our moral 
support to the sandinistas the others would cut our throats and 
vice versa 
the contras garner some favor by not pressing the youths into 
their ranks but they exact a high price for locals who don the 
sandinista uniform or appear to aid the leftist government 
my husband was killed by the contras in 1984 they slashed his 
throat and tossed the body in the river the woman recounted her 
voice hushed and calm they said he was with the sandinistas 
contras killed her oldest son a year earlier because he was 
serving the governments mandatory military service she said 
three of her adult sons aged 23 to 28 spend much of their time 
hiding from passing government troops they constructed a trench by 
the riverbank for the men to escape from sandinista recruitment and 
for the family to flee during battles between the warring factions 
im off the 25yearold son said i move like a snake in 
the mountains when the sandinistas come 
his mother said several of the local boys forced into military 
service left the government ranks with their weapons and joined the 
contras or turned their arms over to the rebels 
on a recent night after the family had gone to sleep a young 
man called at the latched door he wore the camouflage uniform of 
the sandinista army and carried a governmentissued ak47 assault 
rifle 
he had gone a day earlier into the closest small city verdun 
and was recruited by the sandinistas he like many others before 
him fled 
now he has to decide if hell join the contras or just turn 
over his rifle one of the sons said 
his mother rails against the sandinistas whom she frequently 
refers to as communists and the contras who she says come and 
take everything without paying a penny 
the woman heeds the contra demands and feeds the troops in 
retaliation she said a sandinista helicopter fired rockets into

studies in diabetic mice suggest that a 
drug that stimulates the immune system may stop the destruction of 
insulinproducing cells and thus prevent diabetes a researcher 
said friday 
stress and viral infections also have been found to affect the 
development of diabetes said edward leiter a geneticist at the 
jackson laboratory in bar harbor 
leiter said he and his colleagues had expected that an 
immunestimulating drug would make diabetes worse in the mice they 
studied instead it apparently brought the diabetes under control 
the form of diabetes that requires insulin injections is thought 
to occur when the bodys immune system attacks its own 
insulingproducing cells or beta cells in the pancreas leiter 
explained 
the drug a substance called interleukin2 that occurs normally 
in the body in small amounts activates the immune system cells and 
thus should have accelerated the destruction of beta cells leiter 
said 
it appears however that the drug activated some kind of immune 
cell that has the normal function of preventing the bodys defenses 
from attacking the body itself in the mice it blocked the 
destruction of beta cells 
this finding in mice specially bred to have diabetes may not 
hold any immediate importance for humans but it does shed light on 
the basic processes underlying the development of diabetes leiter 
said mice and humans share many genes and a variety of diseases 
leiter has determined that in the mice he studied a strain 
called nonobese diabetic or nod at least three separate genes 
seem related to the development of diabetes 
he has also found that stress appears to aggravate the 
development of diabetes which occurs only in the males of that 
mouse strain 
mice that were kept in standard crowded cages with other males 
and were subjected to the stress of having blood and urine samples 
taken periodically have about a 50 percent chance of developing 
diabetes 
in contrast individual male mice left alone in a cage with a 
female for breeding developed diabetes at about half that rate 
leiter said 
leiters work is among many recent studies that are helping to 
clarify the role of the immune system in diabetes he said 
for example michael ba oldstone of the scripps clinic in la 
jolla calif recently found that infection with a virus could 
block the destruction of beta cells in nod mice 
leiter said viral infections stimulate the production of 
interleukin2 oldstones infected mice might have produced more 
interleukin2 and that might be the reason their diabetes was 
brought under control leiter said 
and japanese researchers have found that nod mice develop 
diabetes at a higher rate when raised in a completely germfree 
environment 
it is as if the immune system freed from the responsibility of 
preventing infection becomes introspective looking for things 
in the body to attack leiter said

harold r harris an aviation pioneer and 
airline executive who claimed to be the first person to save his 
own life with a freefall parachute has died at the age of 92 
harris who rose to the presidency of northwest airlines died 
at home thursday 
he began his aviation career in 1917 in the army signal corps 
which sent him to test caproni bombers in italy 
his livesaving use of a freefall parachute activated by the 
user rather than by a static line on the plane occurred oct 20 
1922 while he worked as a test pilot he said he had to jump when 
the experimental plane he was flying over dayton ohio began 
breaking up 
i pulled the parachute release ring or what i thought was the 
release ring found i was falling with my head down my feet 
pointing to the sky and my body rotating harris said in a 1987 
interview 
i pulled the release ring and the parachute promptly turned me 
rightside up i remember looking at the parachute and wondering how 
such a great expanse of white silk could be so clean even though 
it had plenty of opportunity to be soiled in a dirty hangar 
he landed on brick pavement under a grape arbor near mccook 
field where the flight had begun 
harris also flew as a cropduster in the midwest and latin 
america and helped set up the peruvian airways corp the first 
us flag airline south of the equator 
in 1942 he returned to military service to help organize the 
air transport command he retired from the air force in 1945 as a 
brigadier general 
in the next two decades harris was vice president of american 
overseas airlines atlantic division vice president of pan american 
world airways president of northwest airlines and president of 
aviation financial services he retired in 1965 
he is survived by a son a daughter and four grandchildren

interior secretary donald hodel proclaiming a 
major victory for water users in the west said today the reagan 
administration has taken the position that wilderness areas have no 
implied rights to water 
hodel told a news conference that atty gen edwin meese iii has 
concurred with the department solicitors legal opinion that 
congress must specifically award water when it creates a wilderness 
area 
hodel noted that there are conflicting us district court 
opinions taking opposite sides of a major question in the arid 
west without a specific statement by congress is a wilderness 
area guaranteed the water it needs for proper management 
the current administration feels threatened in the west 
because of the allout offensive by democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis said sen tim wirth dcolo who sat 
in the audience at the news conference which he said simply 
reiterated policy the administration has been following 
the action runs counter to a us district court ruling in 
colorado in 1985 and to a 1979 ruling by an interior department 
solicitor during the carter administration said maggie fox of the 
sierra club 
this marks a new low in meeses and hodels flagrant disregard 
for the law she said i am surprised that they could find an 
attorney willing to sign his name to the document 
hodel said the administration was coming down on the side of a 
recent ruling in new mexico that there are no water guarantees 
unless congress writes them into wilderness legislation 
congress has been skirting the issue in wilderness bills 
remaining silent on water rights and leaving the question up to the 
interior and agriculture departments and court rulings 
hodel noted that very frequently in order to get this water 
for wilderness you have to take it away from someone else 
he said that under the policy the administration would not go 
to court to argue that wilderness areas have implied water rights 
in a letter to hodel meese said that without directives from 
congress the government will handle water needs of wilderness 
areas under the various state mechanisms that apportion water among 
oftencompeting users 
hodel said the policy has the distinct possibility of 
extending beyond the current administration because there would 
be a substantial burden of proof on a new attorney general to sweep 
this aside 
this is a major victory for the western states water users 
and the principles of federalism said hodel flanked by a group 
of republican lawmakers from the west 
congress did not intend to reserve federal water rights for 
wilderness purposes when it created the national wilderness 
preservation system in 1964 he said 
hodel said the rights of existing water users including federal 
forests parks and wilderness areas and indian tribes would be 
protected

several countries have begun calling 
their diplomats home from kabul after a barrage of guerrilla rocket 
attacks on the afghan capital western diplomats said friday 
within one week in midjuly as many as 200 rockets blasted 
kabul 
a rocket smashed into a wing of the french embassy on saturday 
damaging the ambassadors residence but causing no injuries 
another rocket landed near the us embassy compound blowing out 
windows in a nearby apartment building and the radio afghanistan 
complex the diplomats said 
earlier this month a rocket hit a club that is a gathering spot 
for diplomats and one person was injured 
western diplomats said most foreign missions have already sent 
dependents home while others are planning to soon they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in washington charles e redman the state department 
spokesman said he did not know of any damage to the us embassy 
in recent days he declined to say how many us officials were 
assigned to kabul 
i dont know of any plans to change our presence he said 
the thinning out of foreign personnel in kabul has been a 
twophased exercise said diplomatic sources with the eastern 
european missions making the first move most senior personnel at 
these missions left the afghan capital under the pretext of 
vacations said diplomats 
very junior personnel now head most east european missions 
they said 
the diplomats continued to emphasize the increased role of 
soviet forces in the defense of kabul after a years absence 
soviet armor has been redeployed to the west of the city in the 
lake kargha and paghman area 
western diplomats said the governments control of the key 
district town of paghman nine miles west of the capital is in 
jeopardy 
earlier reports claimed 4000 afghan guerrillas massed around 
paghman and diplomats said soviet and afghan army troops as well 
as officers with the afghan secret service khad and army commando 
units moved into the paghman plain to reinforce embattled 
government troops 
the growing involvement of soviet forces in the defense of the 
capital has increased speculation about the afghan governments 
chances of survival once the soviet troop pullout is completed 
an april 14 accord negotiated by the united nations provided for 
the phased withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan half of 
the estimated 100000 troops are to be out by aug 15 and the 
remainder by feb 15 
soviet troops and tanks moved into afghanistan in december 1979 
to prop up the struggling communist government 
the diplomats also said soviet forces backing afghanistans 
marxist government are now fully responsible for defense of kabul 
airport which is a consistent target of rocket attacks by afghan 
guerrillas

arabs in the occupied territories staged a 
neartotal commercial strike friday in a show of solidarity with 
arab women held in israeli jails three arabs were reported wounded 
in clashes in the gaza strip 
an extremist faction of the palestine liberation organization 
called on residents of the west bank and gaza strip to reject 
negotiations with israel 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine put out a 
leaflet calling dialogue with israel an illusion it criticized plo 
spokesman bassam abu sharif who recently advocated 
palestinianisraeli talks under the auspices of an international 
conference 
at the same time your uprising is getting better and better 
some in the field are going back to their old tactics and trying 
the way of dialogue and negotiations said the leaflet which was 
distributed in arab east jerusalem these are nothing but 
illusions 
in another development palestinian leaders were divided in 
their reactions to jordans decision on thursday to cancel a 13 
billion development fund for the occupied territories 
projordanian figures who favor continued jordanian involvement 
in the territories said the cancellation would increase hardships 
for palestinians who have already suffered considerably during the 
uprising 
deposed gaza city mayor rashad shawaa alligned with jordan 
said the move was regrettable because people here need help and 
this was an important source of help but proplo figures did not 
oppose the move which was seen as an effort by hussein to 
disengage himself from leadership in palestinian affairs and give 
the plo more responsibility 
the amman decision will not affect anybody said mustafa 
natsche deposed mayor of the west bank city of hebron and a plo 
supporter he said that although palestinians need aid from all 
arab countries they mostly need to remain steadfast in their 
opposition to israeli rule 
israel captured the west bank from jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war 
observation of fridays general strike on behalf of female 
prisoners was almost complete a reflection of the continued 
influence wielded by underground palestinian leaders 
neither israeli nor palestinian sources were able to provide a 
current figure for the number of women jailed since the uprising 
began last dec 8 about 5800 arabs have been detained according 
to last months military figures but the overwhelming majority are 
men 
protests occurred friday in the shati refugee camp in the 
seaside gaza strip a military spokesman said he said he did not 
know if troops fired on demonstrators but a local reporter said 
three men in their 20s were brought to gaza citys ahli hospital 
with bullet wounds in their legs since the uprising began 235 
palestinians and four israelis have died 
the army also demolished homes belonging to three gazans 
suspected of instigating antiisraeli protests the itim news 
agency said friday the demolitions took place thursday in the 
nusseirat refugee camp 
in the west bank town of ramallah the only movement was of 
children selling newspapers door to door residents said central 
roads were blocked with rocks and burning tires and outlawed 
palestinian flags hung from an electricity pole 
in bethlehem also on the west bank palestinian activists 
poured oil on the streets to prevent workers from going to jobs in 
israel on a wall someone had written in red spray paint death 
to the zionists 
streets of nablus the west banks largest city and the 
occupied gaza strip were deserted except for soldiers and military 
jeeps reporters said 
weekly moslem prayers passed without incident the general 
strike prevented many worshipers from reaching jerusalems al aqsa 
mosque where 300 policemen were on alert for possible violence

condemned the kidnapping of us marine lt col william r 
higgins a un military observer in lebanon but did not mention 
his proiranian abductors 
the resolution adopted by a 150 vote also demanded higgins 
immediate release and called upon un members to use their 
influence in any way possible to promote implementation of its 
appeal for freedom 
higgins was abducted feb 17 by a previously unknown group 
calling itself the islamic revolutionary brigades he is one of 
nine americans and nine other foreigners held captive by 
proiranian extremists in lebanon 
earlier friday higgins wife marine maj robin higgins met 
with secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar i am making a 
constant effort to obtain his release he told her mrs higgins 
did not speak to reporters 
the secretarygeneral has raised the issue of the 18 hostages 
during talks this week with iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati the un chief has appealed to iran to use its influence 
with the islamic fundamentalist captors loyal to iran to gain their 
release 
an iranian diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity later 
told a reporter that there had been no response from tehran to the 
secretarygenerals plea for higgins release 
i want to express my concern to you perez de cuellar told 
mrs higgins when she met him in his office higgins of danville 
ky was chief of a un military observer group when he was 
abducted the vietnam veteran also served as an aide to former 
defense secretary caspar weinberger 
perez de cuellar has met with relatives of other hostages as 
well 
the councils brief resolution said the council already has 
condemned unequivocally all acts of hostagetaking and 
abduction and called for the release of all hostages wherever 
and by whomever they are being held 
iran said thursday it was concentrating on ending its war with 
iraq and had no plans to meet with former democratic presidential 
candidate jesse jackson about freeing the american hostages 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati said that velayati 
doesnt have a mandate to embark on anything other than 
implementation of the security council resolution 598 which 
calls for a ceasefire in the iraniraq war 
velayati and iraqs foreign minister are in new york to discuss 
with perez de cuellar efforts to bring about a ceasefire 
mahallati said velayati would indeed not see jackson who 
said he wanted such a meeting to seek the release of the us 
hostages 
this weeks peace talks raised hopes for gaining the release of 
western hostages in lebanon 
in beirut today the weekly mazagine ashshiraa reported that 
negotiations are under way to free the hostages it quoted an 
unidentified informed security source as saying that highlevel 
contacts were under way between officials of the hostages nations 
and a state with direct influence on the hostages 
the magazine gained international fame when it broke the story 
of secret us arms sales to iran in return for the release of 
hostages in 1986 but most of its recent reports on the hostages 
have not proved accurate 
the hostage held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press anderson 40 was abducted 
in moslem west beirut on march 16 1985 
higgins 43 is chief of the un troop supervision 
organization a military observer group in the middle east 
on thursday jackson telephoned perez de cuellar about the 
hostages and asked him to convey a message to velayati un 
officials said they said the secretarygeneral did so but 
mahallati said his mission had not received a communication from 
perez de cuellar 
iran has said it could intercede to obtain the hostages freedom 
if the united states agreed to release iranian assets frozen in the 
united states 
the united states has said it is willing to discuss the issue 
but has rejected any deal or payment of ransom

george bush talked of secrets both political 
and playful as he continued his quiet search for a running mate 
and bantered with kids at a daycare center friday 
bush the expected republican presidential nominee also took a 
swipe at michael dukakis saying the democratic nominee has 
suggested that ideology doesnt matter such talk just masks over 
his farleft philosophy bush said 
he toured the childcare center in suburban tysons corner va 
bringing attention to his 22 billion proposal that would provide 
tax credits for relatively lowincome families with children 
while there he played catch with children pushed several 
toddlers on a tire swing and helped put tropical fish in a fish 
tank 
when you put a fish in dont ever hold it by the hand bush 
said he joked that he was special because i can talk to fish 
one child asked him are you really going to get to be 
president 
its a secret dont tell the others the vice president 
responded 
he said little about the last real question lingering before the 
republican national convention whom he will choose as his vice 
presidential running mate 
bush told reporters he thinks too much attention is being given 
to the matter since i really believe the election will be 
decided at the presidential level 
he has already contacted more than 12 possible contenders for 
the spot according to aides asked whether he planned to call 
additional prospects bush said probably 
were going through some mandatory investigations he said 
i will make the selection in my own mind before i go down to new 
orleans for the aug 1518 convention in the meantime he said 
i will keep my own counsel 
bush has said he does not plan to announce his choice until the 
convention 
those already contacted by bush include former 
presidentialcampaign rivals sen bob dole of kansas and rep jack 
kemp of new york doles wife former transportation secretary 
elizabeth dole and several people whose names did not figure in 
earlier speculation including sen dan quayle rind 
sen pete v domenici rnm also has said he has been asked 
to submit background information 
bush has now talked with nearly everyone on his long list of 
vice presidential candidates aides said

simpson rwyo william l armstrong rcolo john danforth 
rmo and nancy l kassebaum rkan govs thomas h kean of new

bush has said he hoped to have a tentative list completed by 
weeks end 
as for child care bush who has proposed a 1000perchild tax 
credit primarily aimed at lowincome working mothers voiced 
opposition friday to a 25 billion democratic child care plan that 
would give the federal government a more direct role 
i am absolutely convinced the problem is so big and so diverse 
that the federal government alone cannot have a bricksandmortar 
child care program thats going to be effective bush said 
you have to have choice parental choice family choice and 
you have to have diversity he said

and vibrant action holds great appeal for the 80 percent of indias 
800 million citizens who are hindus 
the serial is also ideally slotted at 930 am sunday just in 
time for hindus to watch the gods on tv after the ritual morning 
bath and prayers 
but the magazine illustrated weekly of india in a cover article 
titled goodbye rama said the serial also resolved an identity 
crisis for hindus after years of smouldering at the shibboleths 
of secularism 
in officially secular india the magazine said the serial 
revived their spirits breaking them into a disturbing rash of 
religious almost reactionary fervor 
secularists were angered when actor arun govil who plays rama 
appeared in saffron robes and urged voters to follow the way of 
the lord and vote for his man in a parliamentary campaign 
the candidate lost but that did nothing to lessen the shows 
popularity in the northern state of kashmir riots broke out when 
a power breakdown interrupted the weekly broadcast

pakistans foreign minister said friday that 
aug 15 will be the critical date in judging whether the soviet 
union is meeting its commitment to withdraw military forces from 
afghanistan 
we need to withhold final judgment on the withdrawals until 
that date foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan told reporters 
the soviet union in an agreement signed in geneva committed to 
withdrawing half its force of more than 110000 by aug 15 
our hope is that this in fact will materialize yaqub khan 
said 
the withdrawals on the whole seem to be going pretty well as 
expected give or take some figures that are not really relevant 
meanwhile we are not particularly apprehensive about the 
withdrawal he added 
yaqub khan met reporters at the white house after greeting 
president reagan on behalf of pakistan president mohammed zia 
ulhaq and congratulating reagan for what the minister called a 
foreign policy that has brought much credit to him to his 
administration and to his country and has indeed been a historical 
event 
he said he and reagan did not discuss the pace of soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan but he thanked the president for us 
backing of the geneva agreements on afghanistan

surgeon general c everett koop on friday 
renewed his call for the nation to escalate the battle against 
smoking with the same fervor it devotes to illicit drugs and he 
assailed a new smokeless cigarette as a drug in a 
cigaretteshaped dispenser 
koop and other antismoking witnesses told congress that the 
food and drug administration should regulate any sales of the 
smokeless cigarette being developed by the rj reynolds 
tobacco co even though the agency does not have jurisdiction over 
regular tobacco products 
the surgeon general noted that our nation has mobilized 
enormous resources to wage a war on drugs illicit drugs we 
should also give priority to the one addiction tobacco addiction 
that is killing more than 300000 americans each year 
koop as he has previously declared that tobacco is as 
addictive as cocaine and heroin and he told a house subcommittee 
that the fda should regulate any sales of the socalled smokeless 
cigarette because it contains nicotine which is a drug in a 
cigaretteshaped dispenser 
koop testified to the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
health and the environment about the 618page antismoking report 
he issued in may careful examination of the data he said 
makes it clear that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are 
addicting an extensive body of research has shown that nicotine is 
the drug in tobacco that causes addiction 
charles o whitley representing the tobacco institute said the 
fda barely has the resources to carry out its current duties 
without adding tobacco products to its jurisdiction he also said 
koops report is a political document 
its conclusions conform with the surgeon generals political 
goal of a smokeless society and undoubtedly were reached long 
before the report was drafted whitley said 
rj reynolds announced last september that it would market the 
smokeless cigarette which contains tobacco unlike other 
cigarettes the company says it heats but does not burn the 
tobacco to deliver the nicotine 
several organizations including the american lung 
associationthe american cancer society and the american medical 
association have petitioned the fda to take jurisdiction over the 
proposed product by classifying it a drug 
several bills have been introduced in congress to give the fda 
authority to regulate the proposed cigarette 
currently most regulation of tobacco products is administered by 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms in the treasury 
department and the federal trade commission the fda has authority 
over food products drugs medical devices and cosmetics 
fda commissioner frank e young told the house subcommittee the 
agency is reviewing the petitions against the smokeless cigarette 
to determine whether this product should be regulated under the 
fdc food drug and cosmetic act 
one can see that the agency must attempt to differentiate 
between the traditional tobacco product marketed without medical 
claims and therefore not regulated by fda and the newer 
innovations designed to deliver nicotine to satisfy nicotine 
dependence or otherwise to affect the structure or function of the 
body he said 
gregory r connolly representing the american public health 
association said that if rj reynolds is serious about producing 
a safer product i suggest they voluntarily submit the device to 
the fda for safety and efficacy testing as a new therapeutic agent 
to help smokers quit 
if they refuse to do so then it is a clear signal that the 
product is meant to improve the corporate health of rj reynolds 
and not the health of the american public he said 
connolly said the association urges the fda to regulate the 
cigarette as it would any other drug delivery device 
scott ballin representing the coalition on smoking or health 
said the fda already has sufficient legal authority and power to 
regulate both cigarettes and new alternative nicotine delivery 
products the failure of the food and drug administration to 
assert this authority will inevitably and unnecessarily further 
jeopardize the health and safety of the american public he said 
richard m cooper an attorney representing rj reynolds 
tobacco co said the fda has no basis to assert control over the 
proposed smokeless product which he said will receive further 
testing by the company before it is marketed 
cooper said the law covers a products use but not its 
characteristics 
thus cigarettes cigars and other tobaccocontaining 
articles marketed for smoking pleasure and other articles marketed 
for smoking pleasure without therapeutic claims simply are not 
drugs or devices under the general interpretation by fda and the 
courts of the relevant provisions of the food drug and cosmetic 
act he said

mikhail s gorbachev on friday proposed tougher 
legislation to punish soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest 
saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms 
the soviet leader told a meeting of the communist party 
leadership that interethnic relations were worsening in some 
regions of the country due in part to active resistance put up 
to perestroika by corrupt groups 
perestroika or restructuring is gorbachevs program for 
widespread economic and social change 
staterun media also indicated friday that a crackdown had begun 
on people in armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a 
mostly armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of azerbaijan 
the sixmonth conflict between the two republics over control of 
the nagornokarabakh district has led to mass rallies strikes and 
ethnic violence since february 
the supreme soviet presidium the governments top executive 
body intervened july 18 it rejected any change in 
nagornokarabakhs status but called for measures to develop the 
regions economy and culture 
the conflict over nagornokarabakh is one of the most rancorous 
domestic disputes faced by gorbachev since he became communist 
party chief in march 1985 he indicated friday he wants to defuse 
tensions between ethnic groups but also to punish those who 
transform the tensions into a political crisis 
gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the central 
committee the partys policymaking body a summary of his remarks 
was distributed by the official tass news agency 
gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of 
tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the soviet union 
tass said 
among the causes gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many 
years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups 
inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive 
personnel and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt 
groups 
tass said that after gorbachev noted that nationalist passions 
benefit all antiperestroika forces he suggested increasing 
accountability in soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife 
tass did not give details of gorbachevs suggestion at the july 
18 presidium meeting the soviet leader accused corrupt 
conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the 
nagornokarabakh annexation drive 
gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly 
from article 36 of the 1977 soviet constitution which says the law 
can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness 
hostility or contempt 
tass said gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve 
ethnic tensions including an increase in power for each of the 
countrys 15 republics a law on equal use of the more than 100 
languages spoken in the soviet union and some economic autonomy for 
the countrys republics and regions 
in particular the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and 
estonia forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 have 
demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs 
the labor newspaper trud said 44 people in yerevan armenias 
capital will face criminal charges following an incident in which 
activists seeking the annexation of nagornokarabakh attached 
slogans to their cars and drove around the city the paper did not 
give the date or size of the mobile demonstration but said 155 
drivers have had their licenses revoked and 310 were fined 
in its july 18th decision the presidium also ordered local law 
enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the caucasus 
mountain region tass reported friday that the situation was 
stabilizing in armenia but said that at the urging of 
instigators some strikes and protests were continuing

the united states hopes to pay 188 million of 
its debt to the united nations before the year is out to help 
prevent the world body from running out of money when it may need 
to mount a peacekeeping operation in the persian gulf un 
ambassador vernon walters said friday 
walters told reporters he is guardedly optimistic that a 
ceasefire will be arranged to halt the iraniraq war and 
estimated initial costs of a un peacekeeping force at 15 million 
to 20 million 
walters testifying before the senate foreign relations 
committee said that if progress is reached at resolving other 
world problems including the soviet occupation of afghanistan 
the cuban presence in angola a transition to independence for 
namibia and the vietnamese occupation of cambodia the un could 
face an annual peacekeeping bill of more than 15 billion 
all of these are important to the interests of the united 
states and all are likely to involve the united nations 
significantly walters said this increase in activity takes 
place at a time when the un is facing a very tight cash 
situation 
the uns financial plight is due in part to the fact that the 
united states partly for policy reasons and partly because of 
budget constraints has withheld or been unable to pay its full 
un assessments 
at present we owe the un in excess of half a billion dollars 
467 million for the regular budget and 70 million for 
peacekeeping walters noted 
the united states has not paid its full assessment for three 
years 
the initial withholdings were intended to spur the un into 
making management and financial reforms 
walters said these changes were made in 1986 
but in the congressional appropriations process over the past 
two years other large cuts were imposed with the united states 
paying only 144 million of its 212 million assessment in 1987 
walters said it is too early to tell if the withholding of much 
of the us assessment has had a negative impact on the un 
peacekeeping efforts 
he noted that un secretary general javier perez de cuellar has 
said that without a large us payment the organization would run 
out of funds by november 
if the un is required to mount a peacekeeping operation in the 
persian gulf it could run out of money in october walters said 
but he said that the reagan administration hopes to release 
188 million in regular payments to the united nations between now 
and the end of the calendar year 
sen nancy kassebaum rkan who sponsored the senate amendment 
to withhold payments to the un suggested the debt be paid over a 
period of years and walters said that might be done 
sen claiborne pell dri the foreign relations chairman 
said the international prestige of the united states is 
compromised by our deadbeat status 
frankly it is embarrassing that the worlds wealthiest 
country wont pay its bills he said 
another witness donald mchenry who was the chief us 
representative to the un in the carter administration said it is 
simply disgraceful and dishonorable if now that events are 
moving the way we want them to move we again find some pretext not 
to pay our share of the relatively modest expenses of consolidating 
the peace 
at a time when peace may be breaking out in several areas of 
the world the un secretary general is being interrupted in the 
search for peace by the need to find enough money to pay the 
utility bills at un headquarters mchenry said 
he said that even if a cure was needed for the un management 
problems the tactic of withholding part of the us assessment was 
illegal a clear violation of our solemn treaty obligations

thousands of sweettoothed buyers sellers and 
distributors stepped into a childs fantasy friday as they wandered 
from booth to booth at a candy convention sampling free chocolates 
picture cookies and gummy bears 
and they had plenty to smile about candy industry news is 
sugarcoated 
americans will spend about 12 billion dollars this year to 
consume about 5 billion pounds of chocolate and nonchocolate 
treats nearly 20 pounds per person in the past five years the 
us confectionery business has grown 3 percent to 6 percent 
annually according to industry figures 
candy is rolling strong said jerry prescott president of 
debs a confectionery distributor that tracks candy sales and 
trends chocolate is still an inthing the concerns over acne 
have been kind of disproven youve got the dollar up so some 
pretty big advertisers are coming in 
at the 43rd annual national candy wholesalers association 
convention which began thursday and ends sunday there was little 
talk of cavities or the us surgeon generals report earlier this 
week about the importance of good nutrition in preventing diseases 
the whole issue of health has dissipated so much said 
shelley grossman of the national candy wholesalers association 
as consumers have become more aware of their own health they are 
much more likely to treat themselves to something like candy 
scant few granola bars or health snacks could be found on the 
convention floor though companies like quaker oats and veryfine 
juices had displays and microwave popcorn appeared popular 
new sweets like boogers green and squishy and designed to look 
like the real thing and slime slurps gummy monsters that change 
color had glitzy booths old reliables touted their timetested 
sweets 
pez is more than a candy its a system said pez candy co 
president scott mcwhinnie popping open a new garfield dispenser to 
demonstrate its great tasting and fun to play with at the same 
time 
pez was developed in 1927 in vienna austria and the dispenser 
was introduced sans heads in europe in 1950 character heads and 
flavors were added in the united states in 1952 today americans 
consume about 1 billion pez candies anually mcwhinnie said 
but until recently the company hadnt resolved the common 
childhood lament pez topple over pez dispensers have feet 
mcwhinnie said proudly now they stand up 
tucked in a corner of a floor redolent of chocolate martin b 
palmer the president of the the 110yearold palmer candy co of 
sioux city iowa was handing out the lafama a chopped pecan and 
cream bar covered in chocolate 
the company uses 90yearold copper kettles to make the bars 
which bear the same goofy package lettering used when the bar 
debuted in 1914 
good candy doesnt go out of style said palmer 31 the 
fifth generation president of the company with annual sales of 
nearly 10 million 
nationally snickers made by mampm mars is the top seller of 
some 750 different candy bar brands reeses peanut butter cups 
made by hershey foods is number two followed by peanut and then 
plain mampms 
mampm mars and hershey combine for about 70 percent of the 
chocolate bar market the reintroduction of red mampms last year 
after an eightyear absence because of concerns over food dyes was 
the talk of the candy world 
the convention was not open to the public but kids will get a 
crack at the candy eventually organizers estimate two to three 
tons of treats will be donated to charities at the end of the 
meeting

president reagan extended jesse jacksons 
secret service protection 30 days to give jackson time to arrange 
private security against death threats the former democratic 
candidate says he has received a white house spokesman said friday 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said jackson had asked that 
government protection be continued based on the defeated 
presidential candidates assessment of threats against his life 
and jacksons plans to campaign for democratic nominee michael 
dukakis 
in chicago eric easter a spokesman for jackson said he had no 
immediate comment on reagans decision jackson has been resting in 
chicago the past few days 
losing candidates for presidential nominations generally have to 
relinquish their secret service detail as soon as the party 
standardbearer is chosen so jackson technically had exhausted his 
right to such protection on july 22 the day after the end of the 
democratic national convention in atlanta 
however fitzwater said that jackson asked for an extension of 
secret service protection presumably through the election he 
indicated that on the basis of threats against his life 
asked if jackson had furnished any details of death threats the 
spokesman replied no asked whether the white house had tried 
to verify threats against jacksons life he said he could not 
comment on such security matters 
only the president is authorized to grant secret service 
protection to nonpresidential candidates a joint housesenate 
committee in congress screens declared candidates and recommends to 
the treasury department which ones merit secret service protection 
secret service spokesman bob snow said only that we do our 
continuing assessments of the security needs of anybody we 
protect 
candidates are generally as tightlipped as the government in 
refusing to give specifics of threats they receive although 
jackson has spoken several times in general terms of threats 
against him during this years campaign 
fitzwater said jacksons secret service protection had been 
maintained without interruption since the democratic convention 
during which dukakis formally won the nomination over jackson 
while reagan weighed whether to approve the extension 
reagans decision was made within the last few days the 
spokesman said 
he said that giving jackson an additional 30 days of secret 
service protection would cost roughly 600000 
reagans decision specifies that there will be no further 
extension the spokesman said 
the feeling was that first of all hes not the nominee of 
the party which is what the law allows he said secondly 
that it didnt seem reasonable to grant this extension once he 
transitions into a private security situation 
he said there had been precedents for extending normal secret 
service protection because of extenuating circumstances for 
example protection was continued for a time for the widow of sen 
robert f kennedy after he was assassinated while running for the 
democratic presidential nomination in 1968

members of the communist party 
leadership said on friday that security forces may take stronger 
action to quell ethnic strife in kosovo a southern province 
dominated by albanians 
the proposal was made during a central committee meeting on ways 
to reduce tension in kosovo between the ethnic albanians and the 
slavic minority made up of serbs and montenegrans it was 
broadcast on state television 
stane dolanc a member of yugoslavias collective presidency 
said without elaboration that the leadership is considering the 
additional engagement of a federal police unit stationed in 
kosovo since last october 
the paramilitary trained and equipped to quell large public 
disturbances was sent there to thwart an expected increase in 
ethnic strife 
it has taken little action since its arrival however and it 
was not clear whether dolanc wanted it to play a more active role 
or was suggesting more units be sent 
vidoje zarkovic of montenegro called for the dispatch of 
additional public security forces from the entire country to help 
in keeping law and order in kosovo 
about 200 serb and montenegrans from kosovo arrived in belgrade 
on friday to demonstrate against what they say is persecution by 
the ethnic albanian majority 
the original plan was for thousands to make the trip but most 
apparently heeded appeals by authorities not to protest during the 
central committee meeting 
ethnic albanians make up 90 percent of kosovos population 
about 30000 serbs and montenegrans have left the province the 
leastdeveloped area of yugoslavia since riots in 1981 
franc setinc a central committee member from slovenia said 
we cannot allow the current ethnic strife in kosovo to turn 
into a clash between different nationalities because that would 
have catastrophic consequences on this part of europe 
ethnic strife in the balkans once earned the peninsula the 
nickname the powder keg of europe and its local conflicts 
brought on world war i 
kosovo is an administrative part of the servian republic 
slobodan milosevic party leader of serbia told the central 
committee constitutional that changes are necessary so serbia can 
exercise its authority in kosovo and act against ethnic albanians 
he said counterrevolution by ethnic albanians in kosovo 
represents a danger to socialism and to yugosavia 
the 1974 yugoslav constitution granted a large measure of 
autonomy to kosovo

a second brokerage sacked a stockbroker today in 
a widening investigation of improper trading based on apparently 
leaked tips of impending business week magazine articles 
prudential bache securities inc dismissed brian callahan a 
broker in its anaheim calif office after it detected suspicious 
trading by him said spokesman peter costiglio he said callahan 
had worked for the firm for about 3 years but had no further 
information about him 
business week confirmed last week it had initiated an inquiry 
into suspected leaks of its inside wall street column 
the hartford conn investment firm advest inc suspended a 
broker in its new london conn office where 10 brokers are 
based spokeswoman martha payne said today she declined to 
disclose the brokers identity or career history 
the suspension was the result of an internal investgiation 
which we conducted she said weve notified the securities and 
exchange commission the investigation is continuing 
officials at the new london office referred all inquiries to ms 
payne 
the disclosure came a day after wall street giant merrill lynch 
amp co disclosed it had fired one employee and was questioning 
another in connection with suspected trading based on 
prepublication tips from inside wall street 
merrill said it fired william dillon 33 a financial consultant 
in its new london office after company lawyers uncovered records 
suggesting he bought and sold stocks with information from the 
column 
people familiar with the merrill inquiry also said the firm was 
examining the actions of a merrill lynch vice president james 
smith in the new london office 
smith had approved some of the questioned trades under a company 
policy requiring junior employees trading for their own account to 
get prior approval from senior executives they said no 
disciplinary action has been taken against him 
company spokesman william clark said dillon had worked at 
merrill lynchs new london office since 1986 but little other 
information was available on the former employee he said that to 
his knowledge no charges had been filed against dillon 
a man who identified himself as dillons father in telephone 
calls to dillons home in old lyme conn said his son was 
unavailable for comment he declined to discuss the matter or 
answer any questions smith did not return telephone calls 
in its aug 8 issue released to the press late thursday 
business week acknowledged to readers it had discovered unusual 
trading in shares mentioned in the wall street column and had 
initiated an investigation 
the relationship between business week and its readers is our 
most valuable asset and we intend to protect it said the note 
to readers 
the note also said the magazine was cooperating with authorities 
in the probe and had tightened its already stringent internal 
security 
business week published by new yorkbased mcgrawhill inc 
said last week its legal counsel was examining the entire operation 
for possible leaks magazine officials believe the information 
probably was leaked by workers at one of four plants that print 
business week or by a postal employee rather than a member of its 
editorial staff 
business week confirmed it was investigating the situation after 
dow jones professional investor report made the initial disclosure 
about possible leaks of information involving the column 
professional investor report said its analysis of 20 stocks 
mentioned in the business week column had found at least eight 
stocks rose sharply the day the magazines came off the presses but 
before they were available to the public 
the securities and exchange commission and the major stock 
exchanges also are investigating the matter 
most securities lawyers agree that the past conviction of a wall 
street journal reporter who leaked advance information to a 
stockbroker would deter journalists from committing a similar act 
r foster winans was sentenced to an 18month prison term 
following his conviction of wire fraud in 1985 for passing tips 
about items scheduled to appear in the newspapers influential 
heard on the street column a federal judge this week reduced 
winans sentence to one year 
business week circulation 960000 is printed weekly at four 
plants including one in old saybrook conn located near new 
london 
rr donnelley amp sons co of chicago which operates the old 
saybrook plant said the company was conducting its own 
investigation into possible leaks at the 550employee plant and at 
another plant in torrance calif and that anyone accused of 
wrongdong faced disciplinary action

us effort last year to send reward offers up in hundreds of 
balloons the group said it will float the bills in plastic bags 
down the mekong river and distribute them along the thai side of 
the river 
i dont want bones i want the live man i want my brother 
adams told a news conference 
he said in an interview that his brother who would be 41 if he 
is still alive was shot down with six other air force personnel on 
oct 18 1966 over the northern part of the gulf of tonkin 
adams a dentist said that a few months ago a woman who had 
worked for the red cross in laos during the war verified 
information that his family received from the red cross 10 months 
after he was shot down the woman said she had seen his brohter 
severely injured but alive in 1967 and was surprised the us 
military concluded he was dead 
adams said he has also received information from a nonamerican 
source whom he said he promised not to identify that his brother 
was now held in a camp in laos 
i have not seen any black and white evidence but i believe he 
is alive adams said 
the veterans groups chairman ted sampley said the effort to 
advertise the reward by stamping vietnamese bills originated with 
former vietnam army nurse lynn hampton who took it upon herself to 
write messages on 3000 bills she secretly distributed during a 
recent visit to vietnam with a missionary group 
ms hampton of winter haven fla said she found no direct 
evidence of live american prisoners during her visit 
sampley urged us officials not to try to stop the 
billstamping effort 
it may seem weird but its going to do what we want it to do 
advertise the reward he said

the transport minister on friday suspended the 
pilot and copilot of an airbus a320 that crashed last month and 
killed three people during a demonstration flight at an air show 
minister michel delebarre said in a statement that a preliminary 
report submitted thursday by an investigating commission revealed 
no failure of the aircraft or its equipment the plane he 
said followed all the orders provided by the crew 
the computerized a320 is the latest airbus model the company a 
european consortium says it is the fastest selling commercial 
plane in history 
in the june 26 accident near mulhouse the plane failed to come 
out of a low pass struck the tops of trees near a runway and 
crashed into a forest 
delebarre criticized the staterun airline air france operator 
of the plane for the inadmissible conditions of the aircrafts 
participation and mission at the airshow 
he said he was suspending the two crew members because of 
elements about the circumstances of the flight exposed by the 
commission investigating the accident there was no elaboration 
on either point 
there have been conflicting reports about the altitude of the 
plane at the time of the accident the pilot has testified his 
instruments showed the plane was flying at about 90 feet but 
sources quoted investigators as saying the plane was at 30 feet 
examining magistrate charles bertin said the ministers decision 
does not influence a judicial investigation of the accident still 
under way 
it is purely an internal sanction the french news agency 
agence francepresse quoted bertin as saying it does not at all 
mean that the two pilots will be charged for penal infractions 
bertin who is in charge of the judicial probe added this 
measure has nothing to do with judicial decisions which could 
eventually be taken

ed van hook 
mrs davis pays her bills on the companys budget plan a 
billing clerk was supposed to raise the bill from 43 to 50 
because mrs davis was using more electricity van hook said but 
the clerk forgot to press a computer key to substitute the new 
amount for the old amount he said 
then another three and some zeros got combined with both the old 
and new bills

the 90 residents of this central ohio 
village couldnt wait any longer for work to finish on the bridge 
that links them with the rest of the world 
although reconstruction on the toboso bridge is not expected to 
be completed for two to three weeks the excitement over the 
reopening gave way to a village party on the bridge complete with 
food music and even a ribboncutting ceremony a construction 
crane and piles of gravel served as the backdrop 
its a test really mike scott said wednesday night as he 
sat at a table on the concrete span over the licking river if we 
can get 200 people on the bridge and it holds up theyll let the 
cars across 
the bridge closed in april and since then getting anywhere 
since has meant miles of detours on winding county and township

congregation to judge themselves not others during a service 
friday in the garden where tradition says jesus was buried 
look into your own hearts today said swaggart reading from 
the bible dont judge others turning to his 350 listeners he 
asked did you hear what i say several responded yes 
swaggart who arrived in israel on thursday for a 10day tour of 
biblical sites lost his credentials as an assemblies of god 
minister earlier this year after he refused to stop preaching for a 
year as punishment for meeting with a prostitute in new orleans 
after the service swaggart told reporters god is the one who 
puts things in the past thats the beautiful thing about 
christianity people love they forgive and they forget 
he said he had been humbled by the public scandal that occurred 
after the disclosure of his sexual activities in february the 
disclosures led him to confess tearfully on nationwide television 
that he had sinned 
i think that i have more love for people now said swaggart 
i think that i feel their pain a little more this world is a 
hurting world and maybe im a little less condemnatorial maybe im 
a little bit less accusatorial 
swaggarts congregants appeared moved by his 45minute sermon 
some cried others raised their hands in the air and uttered 
hallelujah or praise the lord 
i love him i love him said ray grant 55 of houston 
but others voiced criticism of swaggart 
i wouldnt say his deeds enhanced his image said oleda 
mccurdy of fort pine ala but you have to forgive 
i was bothered by how the scandal was handled said charles 
kester 20 of siloam springs ark i wonder about the soundness 
of his leadership 
kester in israel for the first time said the country was a 
bit different from what i imagined here you see tanks and people 
on street corners carry uzi submachine guns thats not the way it 
looks in the picture on the back of the bible 
swaggarts tour is called journey with a purpose a 
television crew will tape his sermons and the footage will be shown 
on his daily television show

the duchess of york wife of prince andrew will 
soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy 
which survived two accidents a family scandal and a flood of 
rumors 
buckingham palace insists the birth is due in midaugust but 
britain already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla 
spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big 
day is imminent 
the sun newspaper said friday the duchess weight and other 
health problems may force a caesarian delivery this weekend 
on july 22 the star claimed the birth was likely to be 
artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared 
losing the baby 
every other day andrew is prematurely reported to have left his 
royal navy ship in singapore to be at her side during the delivery 
but buckingham palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing 
to comment on the press reports 
the baby to carry the title prince or princess of york will be 
queen elizabeth iis fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed 
her 
complications which could endanger mother and baby have led 
her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery the sun 
reported friday 
the newspaper said without attribution that the duchess doctor 
had decided on a caesarian section because she is suffering from 
high blood pressure and severe water retention and because the 
baby is in a breech position meaning it would be born bottom first 
rather than head first as is normal 
the star added that the rolypoly duchess has gained almost 
50 pounds during the pregnancy 
the 28yearold duchess the former sarah ferguson married 
andrew the queens second oldest son in july 1986 when she 
didnt become pregnant in the first year the british media 
speculated that fergie was being treated for infertility 
although her family repeatedly denied it 
the duchess radiated good health during the early months of her 
pregnancy she skiied in europe performed a full calendar of royal 
engagements and worked at her publishing job until february when 
the palace confirmed her pregnancy on jan 25 the duchess was 
taking a helicopter flying lesson 
then came two scares and a family scandal 
the duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the french 
alps in march when she was four months pregnant earlier this 
month she escaped injury when her car driven by a police 
bodyguard collided with another car on a busy highway outside 
london 
meanwhile the tabloids discovered that her father maj ronald 
ferguson was frequenting a london massage parlor the scandal 
almost got him expelled from his polo club 
the duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of 
doctor and hospital 
instead of dr george pinker royal gynecologist since 1973 and 
deliverer of nine princes and princesses she has chosen dr 
anthony kenney a prominent london obstetrician known to favor 
natural childbirth 
she has picked the private americanowned portland hospital in 
west london unlike her sistersinlaw princess diana and princess 
anne who had their babies in the private wing of a staterun 
hospital 
the modern portland hospital is said to be britains most 
expensive maternity clinic 
the sun says room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and 
decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains 
andrew was quoted as saying in may that the baby will be a girl 
and will be named annabelle he refused a gift of a childs cricket 
bat from a yorkshire cricket team saying it wont be much use 
im sure we are having a girl 
however the prince has a reputation as a prankster and 
buckingham palace said of his comments its all speculation 
bookmakers william hill say annabelle remains the favorite name 
for a girl and david for a boy

the federal aviation administration on friday 
ordered a special inspection of landing gear brakes on longrange 
mcdonnell douglas dc10 aircraft and directed that the brakes be 
replaced if they exceed prescribed wear limits 
the order came in response to a may 21 accident involving an 
american airlines dc10 last may in which eight of the planes 10 
brakes failed when the pilot aborted his takeoff causing the plane 
to skid 1000 feet beyond the runway at the dallasfort worth 
airport 
the three crewmembers in the cockpit and five of the 240 
passengers were injured and the plane was heavily damaged 
the faa directive applies only to mcdonnell douglas dc10 series 
30 and series 40 planes the somewhat heavier longrange version of 
the aircraft said faa spokesman dick stafford 
according to mcdonnell douglas there are 66 of the longrange 
dc10s in service in the united states and 229 worldwide among the 
airlines that fly the longrange plane are northwest airlines 
united airlines american airlines and the freight carrier federal 
express 
under the faa order the inspections must be made by aug 20 and 
by that date all brakes that do not meet prescribed wear limits 
must be replaced said stafford 
the order does not apply to lighter shorterrange dc10 series 
10 aircraft of which there are about 120 being flown by us air 
carriers generally in domestic service according to faa and 
mcdonnell douglas officials 
earlier this month the national transportation safety board as 
a result of its findings in the dallasfort worth accident 
expressed concern about the faas brake wear requirements 
the safety board urged a broad review of the requirements for 
all types of jetliners the faa told the ntsb it was in the early 
stages of reviewing its brake wear requirements 
in the may 21 accident involving the american airlines jet the 
pilot aborted his takeoff while traveling 204 mph down the runway 
because he thought erroneously it later turned out that his 
flaps or slats may have been in the wrong position 
the plane slowed to 149 mph in the first six seconds but the 
deceleration decayed rapidly and the jet went off the end of the 
runway still traveling 117 mph according to the ntsb the jet lost 
its nose gear and plowed through the dirt for 1000 feet before 
coming to a halt 
investigators found that eight of the 10 landing gear brakes 
were near the maximum wear limits before the aborted takeoff 
and failed within 8 to 9 seconds after being applied the safety 
board said july 11

a prominent american jewish leader after a 
meeting friday with secretary of state george p shultz urged the 
soviet union to broaden its recently proclaimed policy of allowing 
jews who emigrate to choose their new homeland 
morris b abram chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry said moscow should allow more jews to apply for exit permits 
to any country of their choice rather than just israel a kremlin 
official said thursday that its up to them where they go 
most soviet jews permitted to emigrate are given exit permits 
for israel but about 90 percent go to the united states once they 
reach vienna the transit point to tel aviv 
concerned about the loss of immigrants the israeli cabinet has 
ordered a change in procedures soviet jews granted exit permits 
would receive their israeli visas in romania and go on to israel 
from there it would be difficult to get to the united states 
because they would no longer have refugee status 
abram said the israeli government has a right to make that 
decision and that it would be a travesty to permit immigrants 
from the soviet union to retain refugee status once they reached 
israel 
it would be a declaration that a jew welcomed as he is in 
israel is a refugee in his homeland abram said that would be 
a terrible construction of the meaning and purpose of the jewish 
state 
soviet jews who go to israel are considered immigrants under 
us law as a result it is much more difficult for them to gain 
admission to the united states than as refugees in vienna 
the situation has caused some strains between american jews and 
israel as well as disputes within the american jewish community 
the solution abram said lies in the soviet governments 
assertion that it does not care where emigrants chose to live he 
cited a statement on thursday by deputy foreign minister vladimir 
petrovsky in moscow that we just allow all these people to leave 
the country its up to them where they go 
abram said as long as that is the position of the soviet 
government it is quite possible for freedom of choice to be 
exercised in the soviet union 
in the past year the soviet union has increased jewish 
emigration to the west to a rate of more than 1000 a month 
compared to 1000 a year in the early 1980s 
according to statistics compiled by the national conference on 
soviet jewry 60 to 90 jews a month are permitted to leave directly 
for the united states abram said 6000 nonjews were allowed to go 
last year 
so the idea that it is soviet policy to prevent people from 
leaving directly on american visas doesnt seem to be the case 
abram said in this case it seems to be that what they say is 
what they have been doing lets hope they continue 
abram said shultz supports the principle of freedom of choice 
otherwise he and state department spokesman charles e redman 
declined to elaborate on shultzs position

state agriculture officials banned the 
movement of some fruits and vegetables in a suburban area and made 
plans friday to release millions of sterile flies to combat the 
destructive mediterranean fruit fly 
no new mediterranean fruit flies were found friday in the 
quarantine area 62 square miles of the san fernando valley a 
collection of bedroom communities 10 miles northwest of downtown 
los angeles 
thats a very good sign that aerial spraying and ground 
spraying are working said gera curry a spokeswoman for the 
state department of food and agriculture 
the medfly infestation was discovered in the san fernando valley 
city of northridge more than a week ago four medflies have been 
found thus far 
the medfly one of the most destructive cropdestroying insects 
is common in hawaii and probably was carried into southern 
california on fruit brought by tourists 
last monday 16 square miles of the san fernando valley was 
sprayed with pesticides by helicopter and ground crews also have 
been spraying 
the produce quarantine which began thursday bans removal or 
movement of homegrown fruit and garden vegetables in the 
quarantine area 
the quarantine also prohibits the sale of produce from street 
and pushcart vendors in addition it bans residents from taking 
fruits and vegetables into their workplaces for distribution 
by moving fruit out of that quarantine area you may be moving 
medfly ms curry said the whole point of this is to make sure 
anything that moves is safe 
grocery stores and fruit and vegetable stands whose suppliers 
treat the food with pesticide will be allowed to continue selling 
produce 
meanwhile officials said they plan to release 4 million sterile 
flies next week the release of sterile flies will drastically 
reduce the chances of the female medflies laying eggs state and 
county officials explained 
the quarantine is expected to last until early november but 
agriculture officials said it could end earlier if the infestation 
is eradicated 
there was a fivemonth 110squaremile quarantine in eastern 
los angeles in july 1987 because of a slightly larger medfly 
infestation the states most serious infestation cost 976 
million in eradication efforts that continued from 1980 to 1982

the reagan administration in a decision 
angering environmentalists said wilderness areas have no automatic 
claim to water rights interior secretary donald hodel said friday 
this is a major victory for the western states water users 
and the principles of federalism hodel flanked by a happy group 
of republican lawmakers from the west told a capitol hill news 
confernce 
hodel said that soondeparting attorney gen edwin meese iii 
concurs with a legal opinion by interior solicitor ralph tarr that 
congress must specifically award water to a wilderness area when it 
creates the nodevelopment enclave 
this is a public resource giveaway of monumental 
proportions said debbie sease of the sierra club hodel and 
meese are sacrificing the lifeblood of our wilderness areas water 
by saying come and get it we wont defend it 
hodel noted that us district court rulings disagree on a major 
question in the arid west does the mere creation of a wilderness 
area by congress guarantee it will have enough water to ensure its 
proper management 
he said the administration was siding with a recent ruling in 
new mexico that said there are no water rights unless congress 
writes them into wilderness legislation 
congress has been skirting the controversial issue in wilderness 
bills leaving it up to to the interior and agriculture departments 
and the courts to settle conflicting demands for scarce water 
in most cases these wilderness bills would not have passed if 
congress had to take water away from someone hodel said in 
order to get this water you have to take it away from someone 
else 
under the administration policy the rights of existing water 
users including federal forests parks and wilderness areas and 
indian tribes wold be maintained and protected according to hodel 
he indicated that new areas lacking specific statutory water 
guarantees will have to compete for water with other users before 
various state water allotment authorities 
sen steve symms ridaho said that the people who live along 
the banks of the snake river are much better qualified to make 
decisions about water use than the people who live along the banks 
of the potomac river 
this is an important decision for all of us in the west 
added sen jake garn rutah sen james mcclure ridaho said the 
policy will help us resolve an issue that has confounded us 
hodels announcement was immediately attacked by environmental 
groups and by sen tim wirth dcolo who called the news 
conference a political event because it reiterated a position the 
administration has previously taken 
the current administration feels threatened in the west 
because of the allout offensive by democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis said wirth who sat in the audience at 
the news conference 
this is the first time ive seen a fullblown press conference 
on a solicitors opinion wirth said this doesnt solve 
anything except inflame things politically 
the policy runs counter to a us district court ruling in 
colorado in 1985 and to a 1979 opinion by an interior department 
solicitor during the carter administration said maggie fox of the 
sierra club 
this marks a new low in meeses and hodels flagrant disregard 
for the law she said 
the spirit of james watt is alive and well said wilderness 
society vice president sydney butler referring to the 
administrations first interior secretary 
christopher meyer a water lawyer for the national wildlife 
federation said that the decision reflects just about as much 
careful thought as the administrations decision to sell arms to 
iran 
hodel said the policy has the distinct possibility of 
extending beyond the current administration

the kremlin leadership on friday adopted broad 
goals for making government more responsive and mikhail s 
gorbachev urged pruning the communist party to exclude all but the 
best and brightest tass said 
the soviet leader asked the communist party central committee to 
have the parliament meet in november to make constitutional changes 
allowing contested elections next march tass said but it was 
unclear from the report whether the committee adopted all of 
gorbachevs proposals 
gorbachevs proposal calls for multicandidate elections to a 
new 2250member congress of peoples deputies which in turn would 
choose a fulltime parliament of at least 400 members and a 
president with broad powers 
tass the official news agency issued a brief dispatch on the 
eighthour meeting that included only vague descriptions of decrees 
and decisions adopted by the central committee which has about 300 
members 
its report on gorbachevs opening address said he touched on 
many issues including youth problems and nationalities 
specifically the debate over control of the nagornokarabakh the 
caucasus enclave is part of azerbaijan but its predominantly 
armenian population wants it annexed to soviet armenia 
the 57yearold soviet leader also said he wants the 20million 
membership of the communist party reduced significantly to 
include only the vanguard of soviet society 
at present less than 10 percent of soviet adults gain 
admittance to the allpowerful party 
gorbachev also said a nationwide conference held a month ago 
confirmed the communist partys role as the real driving force 
of reform he said the meetings major accomplishment was 
recognizing the partys predominance 
membership rolls are to be reviewed before the end of the year 
that process could be used to dump the idle and corrupt or to 
strengthen gorbachevs base by revoking the memberships of his 
conservative opponents 
gorbachev also acknowledged friday that the nationwide 
conference also demonstrated that conservative sentiments 
longing for the past attempts to sow doubts to portray 
perestroika not as a historic endeavor but almost as a social 
destabilization have by far not yet been overcome in society 
perestroika is the term for gorbachevs program of economic 
and social reform 
gorbachev has faced resistance from some party members who think 
he is moving too fast to change how soviet society and its economy 
have operated for decades 
the central committee approved resolutions on reports and 
voting in party organizations and on the general directions of 
reconstruction of the party apparatus tass said 
a special commission was formed with gorbachev as chairman 
for the preparation of proposals for implementing the decisions 
of the 19th allunion party conference it reported 
that forum which ended july 1 authorized a major revamping of 
individual rights and the structure of government among its 
recommendations were limiting elected party and government 
officials to two fiveyear terms and multiple candidates for 
elective office 
tass said the central committee meeting was over and details of 
its actions would be published in the press 
a spokesman at the central committees information department 
would not say whether changes had been made to the 13member ruling 
politburo 
you will have to wait for the official announcements he 
said and asked that his name not be used 
western and soviet sources had predicted at least one 
longstanding member would resign during the meeting and perhaps set 
a precedent for orderly retirement from the politburo whose 
members traditionally have served for life or been voted out in 
disgrace 
among those reported in line for retirement are president andrei 
a gromyko 79 and mikhail s solomentsev 74 there have been 
persistent rumors that vladimir v shcherbitsky the ukrainian 
party chief would be ousted or retired and viktor m chebrikov 
head of the kgb secret police replaced 
the politburo decided july 4 that the central committee would 
meet to implement reforms of the political system the 
democratization of party state and social life 
gorbachev has also called for a society ruled by laws which he 
said would avoid a return of stalinist repression or the corruption 
and stagnation that characterized leonid i brezhnevs leadership 
resolutions adopted by the party conference provided an outline 
for change which the central committee must translate into 
specific programs and a timetable 
they range from ending bureaucratic meddling in agriculture to 
making all nonclassified government information available to the 
citizenry

the army issued reassurances friday that it 
was not making or storing chemical weapons at all five sites the 
us government would open up for inspection under a proposed 
international treaty 
and a spokesman lt col john chapla stressed that us 
chemical weapons are designed not to become lethal until they reach 
the battlefield 
the army issued a detailed statement the day after ambassador 
max friedersdorf chief us delegate to the conference on 
disarmament in geneva listed five sites that the american 
government would declare as production facilities under a proposed 
international convention banning chemical weapons 
the talks involving 40 nations have been going on for 20 years 
the sites mentioned by friedersdorf were rocky mountain 
arsenal colo pine bluff arsenal ark muscle shoals ala 
newport army ammunition depot ind and aberdeen proving ground 
md 
in a related development a senate panel that has been 
investigating the armys chemical weapons program gave it high 
marks for safety 
at the most critical point where workers are in close 
proximity to the agent the chemical safety program is the 
strongest the workers at chemical storage areas are confident that 
they work in a safe environment said the report which was 
written by the armys inspector general and released by the senate 
governmental affairs oversight subcommittee 
the army resumed producing chemical weapons last december after 
stopping in 1969 spokesmen say the current socalled binary 
weapons pose fewer storage and handling dangers than earlier 
unitary weapons because they consist of two separate chemicals 
which are brought together in an artillery shell just before firing 
the binary program is such that you never have a complete 
weapon stored in any one place the two chemicals are never kept 
together and they will not be mated until just before firing 
said chapla the spokesman 
should a chemical weapons treaty be signed said chapla all 
five sites mentioned in geneva would be subject to whatever 
provisions it may contain regarding the inspection or dismantling 
of facilities 
the context of ambassador friedersdorfs statement is that at 
each of the locations he identified facilities exist which are or 
were at one time involved in the production of chemical weapons 
the statement said 
while all five of the facilities mentioned had some historical 
connection with production of unitary chemical weapons using one 
rather than two chemicals the us has not been involved in the 
production of unitary chemical weapons since 1969 the statement 
said 
no chemical weapons production of any kind is going on at 
rocky mountain arsenal or newport army ammunition plant it said 
the army facilities at pine bluff arkansas are involved in 
the production of a nonlethal component for the binary weapons 
system 
no chemical weapons are being produced at aberdeen proving 
ground aberdeen was formerly connected with the production of 
unitary chemical weapons prior to 1969 
no chemical weapons are being produced at muscle shoals the 
statement said at present the muscle shoals facility is 
involved in a pilot plant project which will be used to prove out 
the production process for one of the two chemicals involved it 
the final weapon 
spending for biological and chemical research has increased 
sharply since president reagan took office in 1981 in fiscal 1980 
the total research was 635 million compared with 348 million 
figure in fiscal 1986

iraqi officials say their greatest 
achievement in the persian gulf war was preventing ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini from exporting irans islamic revolution 
throughout the arab world 
diplomats in baghdad say the war also helped unite iraq and make 
it a more efficient nation which will be able to better use its 
vast oil resources in the future despite the tremendous debt and 
losses suffered in the 8yearold war 
the iraqis clearly view the humiliation of the iranian leader as 
the main benefit of the war which killed an estimated 1 million 
iranians and iraqis 
the most important outcome was not the technical victories we 
scored against the iranian army but rather the entire defeat of 
the ideological foundation on which the iranian regime is based 
president saddam hussein said in a recent speech 
khomeinism was not only evil and dangerous to iraq and the 
arab world but to humanity at large hussein said in the speech 
which followed iraqi victories that led to irans acceptance of a 
ceasefire resolution on july 18 
a senior iraqi official called recent developments a 
watershed because khomeini accepted defeat and the notion 
of coexistence with a secular regime of cooperation on political 
boundaries 
by accepting this in a legal and political sense it will be 
the end of a model khomeini hoped to spread throughout the 
region the official said 
nobody would imagine that khomeini would humiliate himself 
by accepting the ceasefire he had long opposed said the official 
who demanded anonymity were very happy because hes not going 
to be the prophet anymore 
khomeini came to power in 1979 vowing to export his revolution 
throught the islamic world his call was taken up by islamic 
radicals throughout the arab world generating protests and 
guerrilla action in kuwait saudi arabia iraq lebanon egypt 
bahrain tunisia and other countries 
the bloodiest protests occurred in saudi arabia where 
khomeiniinspired fundamentalists briefly seized islams holiest 
shrine the grand mosque in mecca in 1979 and where iranian 
demonstrations led to a bloodbath during the islamic pilgrimage to 
mecca in 1987 
iran responded to the 1987 clashes by demanding the downfall of 
saudi arabias own islamic fundamentalist government which is 
based on mainstream sunni islam 
the strongest factions are in lebanon where iranianbacked 
militias have called for creating an islamic republic 
shiite moslems the overwhelming majority in iran revere the 
martyrdom of the prophet mohammeds grandson hussein in 680 in an 
islamic factional war from which the sunni and shiite branches of 
the faith developed 
the iraniraq war itself was preceded by iranian threats against 
iraqs secular socialist government 
during the war iran hosted a dissident iraqi 
governmentinexile headed by fundamentalist clerics and it vowed 
to pursue the conflict until hussein and his associates were 
toppled 
iraqi officials claim they were never worried about a 
khomeinistyle revolution in their country but they took strong 
action against prokhomeini forces inside their country which 
like iran has a shiite moslem majority 
shortly before the war broke out in 1980 the iraqis deported 
35000 ethnic iranians and executed ayatollah baqr alsadr who had 
vowed allegiance to khomeiniit also crushed the prokhomeini dawa 
party 
once the war started iraqs shiites remained loyal

jordan said friday that its new policy of 
distancing itself from affairs in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip to give the plo a larger role does not mean cutting 
its ties to the people there 
information minister hani khasawneh noted that jordan will 
continue paying the salaries of teachers and other administrative 
officials in the occupied lands and that palestinians from there 
could keep their jordanian passports 
khasawneh stressed that jordans decision to give the 
palestinians a free hand to deal with their 40yearold issue 
does not mean that we are cutting all links with palestinians 
the palestinians right to citizenship and a passport 
could not be changed unless it is the will of its holder the 
minister added 
jordan said thursday it was ending a fiveyear 13 billion 
development program for education and other services in the 
occupied territories started in 1986 khasawneh also said that all 
joint jordanianpalestinian institutions such as the jordanian 
parliament were under review 
wahid jabari the representative from hebron on the west bank 
and one of 30 palestinian members of the 60member lower house of 
parliament said ties between jordan and the occupied lands could 
never be completely severed 
arab summits international conferences or wishes of some 
parties cannot abolish the sacred unity between the two banks 
jabari said 
i do not support the jordanian step to withdraw its 
responsibility toward the palestinian people whatever the reasons 
were 
jabari dismissed reports that the 8monthold uprising against 
israeli military occupation had also fueled feelings against 
jordans king hussein 
people there have deep respect and admiration for king hussein 
and his policies he said 
the territories have been occupied by the israeli military since 
the 1967 middle east war when israel seized the west bank from 
jordan and the gaza strip from egypt twothirds of jordans 35 
million population is of palestinian origin but carry jordanian 
passports 
a senior jordanian official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said jordans decision to give the palestine liberation 
organization more responsibility in the occupied lands although 
clear does not mean that we are giving up our commitments to 
palestinans and their issue

thirteen more antiabortion demonstrators were 
arrested friday and refused to give their names raising to more 
than 100 the number of abortion foes jailed in a waiting game of 
anonymity with authorities 
a group called operation rescue organized the protest outside 
the atlanta surgicenter a clinic where abortions among other 
medical services are performed 
the group led a similar protest at the clinic during the 
democratic national convention on july 19 when 134 were arrested 
about 96 of the first batch have refused to give their names and 
remain in jail identifying themselves as numbered baby jane 
does and baby john does in solidarity they say with 
aborted fetuses 
all pleaded innocent to the only charge against them criminal 
trespass in three days of municipal court appearances that ended 
friday 
those arrested friday were charged with giving a false name 
criminal trespass unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct and are 
to appear in court monday 
one demonstrator entered the clinic and tried to talk people in 
the waiting room out of having abortions but was ushered out by 
employees 
operation rescue spokesman lowell patterson said about 75 
percent of those jailed vowed to conceal their identities and 
remain jailed until their appearances in state court if that date 
is within the next month or so 
he said some others would identify themselves in the next few 
days and sign 500 recognizance bonds if business or personal 
matters required them to leave 
court officials say they cannot free unidentified people on bond 
because there is no way of keeping track of them or assuring that 
they return for scheduled court appearances 
we will continue not to provide our identities to break the 
grip which the abortion industry holds over the criminal justice 
system in atlanta said randall terry director of operation 
rescue

syndicated columnist carl t rowan a longtime 
proponent of strict handgun control has been charged with 
unauthorized possession of a weapon and ammunition after shooting a 
teenager who took an unauthorized dip in his backyard pool court 
records show 
district of columbia officials denied friday that they tried to 
suppress public knowledge of the charges even though they had told 
reporters no decision had been reached a day after the paperwork 
was filed on wednesday 
rowan 62 allegedly used an unregistered pistol and bullets to 
shoot a trespasser in his backyard june 14 the youth suffered a 
wrist wound and was treated and released the same day 
rowan is scheduled to appear in district of columbia superior 
court monday for arraignment on the misdemeanor possession charges 
according to court records 
if convicted on both counts the columnist would face a maximum 
penalty of two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
when contacted by a reporter in reno nev where he was 
scheduled to deliver a speech before the national conference of 
state legislatures rowan refused to discuss the legal developments 
my lawyers are doing all the talking i dont know all the 
details yet rowan said 
district of columbia corporation counsel frederick d cooke jr 
the citys top attorney contended that an administrative filing 
error left him and other top attorneys unaware that the charges had 
been filed 
the agreement we reached with mr rowans attorney was to file 
charges next week since he rowan was out of town said cooke 
there was never any intent to deceive the press or the public 
about what was going on 
rowans attorney raoul l carroll confirmed cookes account of 
the matter 
questions remained about the citys delays in handling the case 
rowan was charged nearly six weeks after the incident occurred 
while cooke acknowledged that the city usually decides whether to 
bring charges in such instances within three weeks 
rowan was cleared last month of assault charges in the shooting 
incident after an investigation by the federal prosecutors office 
but us attorney jay stephens said at the time that he believed 
rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun 
stephens deferred that decision to the city which normally 
handles such cases 
after the shooting incident progun groups said rowan was a 
hypocrite for owning a handgun after criticizing the practice 
numerous times in his column rowan said he obtained the weapon 
only after receiving death threats and was indirectly misinformed 
by police about the need to register it 
the districts farreaching 1976 handgun ordinance requires that 
all weapons be registered 
but rowan told authorities that the gun had belonged to his son 
carl jr a former fbi agent and that his son was told he did not 
have to register the weapon after leaving the bureau 
rowan said he heard noises in his back yard called police and 
then discovered benjamin smith 18 of chevy chase md and three 
other youths by his swimming pool 
rowan said he shot smith after the teenager lunged at him 
smith disputed that saying he had not threatened the columnist and 
had been shot while trying to flee 
smith who was wounded in the wrist was treated and released 
the same day from georgetown university hospital he was charged 
with one count of unlawful entry but prosecutors dropped the 
misdemeanor charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service 
work 
my lawyer wont let me talk but theres a lot id like to 
say smith said when told rowan would be charged calls to 
smiths attorney were not returned

knightridder inc says it has no policy of pulling 
its editorial punches on edwin meese even though two major 
knightridder newspapers have blocked editorial cartoons critical 
of the attorney general as he nears a decision crucial to the 
publishing companys bottom line 
editors at the detroit free press and the miami herald 
acknowledge that they decided against running some cartoons about 
meese while he was considering a proposed agreement by which the 
free press and the detroit news a gannett newspaper would merge 
business functions while remaining editorially separate 
but other knightridder editors across the country said they are 
not preoccupied with meeses pending decision in fact one of the 
papers described meese in an editorial as a boob 
the editors also said they have received no corporate directive 
on the issue 
the partner in the detroit deal gannett co inc said it has 
not tried to guide its papers on covering meese we have not and 
do not offer guidance to our papers on editorial matters 
charles overby gannett vice president for news said thursday 
louis a weil iii publisher of gannetts detroit news said the 
pending meese decision has not affected his newspapers editorial 
page content 
larry jinks senior vice president for news and operations at 
knightridders corporate headquarters in miami said thursday that 
corporate interference in editorial coverage would be out of 
character for the newspaper group winner of multiple pulitzer 
prizes and owner of 30 daily newspapers in 16 states 
i dont tell people what to put on their editorial pages he 
said its a fundamental article of faith that we dont dictate 
editorial page policy from the corporate level 
meese has agreed to decide before he leaves office next month 
the fate of an application from knightridder and gannett to merge 
the business functions of the two detroit newspapers 
under the newspaper preservation act the attorney general has 
the power to grant special antitrust exemptions to failing 
newspapers by eliminating competition for advertising as long as 
each paper preserves its editorial independence 
miami herald editor jim hampton said he decided to ask herald 
cartoonist jim morin not to draw cartoons about meese while the 
decision is considered hampton said he has confined the 
newspapers commentary on meese to the written word rather than 
political cartoons because a cartoon cant say on the other 
hand 
free press editor joe stroud who decided against running 
several cartoons by staff cartoonist bill day has said were 
walking through a situation in which you cant deal with things as 
freely as you can with a situation in which there is no vested 
interest stroud noted the free press has carried meese 
editorials at all the key points during the period in which 
meese has fought allegations of financial improprieties and 
unethical behavior 
another knightridder newspaper the san jose mercury news has 
published nine editorials on meese and a dozen meese cartoons since 
the beginning of the year the cartoons about meese were often 
uncomplimentary and one depicted the justice department as a 
dilapidated ratinfested building 
bob stiff editor of the tallahassee fla democrat said his 
paper has run numerous cartoons and editorials about meese all 
critical of him 
both the philadelphia inquirer and the philadelphia daily news 
knightridder papers have been critical of meese in editorials and 
editorial cartoons in 1988 and neither has withheld cartoons on the 
attorney general according to editorial page editors 
don harrison deputy editor for the editorial pages at the 
philadelphia daily news said the paper has run eight editorials 
highly critical of meese including one referring to the attorney 
general as a boob 
the seattle times editorial page editor herb f robinson said 
his papers coverage of meese is no holds barred and has gotten 
no corporate directives 
i think id go to the wall on something like that he said 
an editorial cartoon isnt supposed to be fair 
lloyd gray editorial page editor of the sun herald in biloxi 
miss said he runs the work of three syndicated cartoonists and 
two have done fairly regular cartoons about meese 
weve taken the position hes not done a good job of keeping 
out of trouble well continue to make our judgments on things 
entirely unrelated to the detroit decision gray said 
jack swift editor of the columbus ga ledgerenquirer has 
not pulled meese cartoons either 
we have no such policy swift said weve had no 
communication or conversation with anyone from knightridder about 
it and were doing basically what we feel is best for our 
readers

a state house candidate who drove his 
imported car to a united auto workers meeting has only himself to 
blame for losing the endorsements of michigans two major labor 
groups a union spokesman says 
david rutledge of ypsilanti complained earlier this week that 
house speaker gary owen coerced leaders of the michigan state 
aflcio to support his handpicked successor kirk profit over 
rutledge in a primary election despite a decision by the groups 
local members to remain neutral 
but tim hughes a spokesman for the aflcio said rutledges 
admission to a uaw local screening committee that he owns a subaru 
and his wife drives a mercedes killed any chance he had of winning 
labor support 
thats the first thing they do is look out the window and see 
what you drive hughes said chuckling 
somebody who thinks that little of workers in their district 
that theyre driving a foreign car is not going to get their 
endorsement hughes said insisting that owens preference never 
came into play 
if god himself endorsed rutledge and he drove up in a 
subaru hes not getting our endorsement hughes added 
rutledge said hes not surprised the union is using his choice 
of cars against him but he has borrowed an americanmade car for 
the rest of the campaign 
if thats the only thing that owen and company can find in 
terms of a negative about david rutledge i accept that 
he said that if driving is an issue perhaps voters should 
consider that his opponent profit has been arrested for drunken 
driving at least i can say ive never been caught drunk driving 
in either one of my cars he said 
profit and rutledge will face off in next tuesdays democratic 
primary for the right to take on the republican winner in november 
political action committees for the michigan uaw and aflcio 
have each contributed 2500 to profits campaign 
owens decision not to seek a ninth term in the house prompted 
his two former staffers to compete for his seat 
profit 35 served four years as assistant majority director of 
house democrats he is a former undersheriff in wayne county 
rutledge 43 was recruited by owen two years ago as deputy 
director of the house democratic research staff

prices farmers got for raw products in july 
rose 36 percent from june as drought continued to take a toll of 
crop and livestock production the agriculture department said 
friday 
the departments agricultural statistics board said in its 
preliminary report that higher prices for corn soybeans and eggs 
contributed most to the july increase lower prices for oranges 
cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities 
compared with a year earlier july prices averaged 10 percent 
higher the report also included revised figures showing that the 
index rose only 22 percent in june compared with the preliminary 
reading of 37 percent announced a month ago 
department projections earlier this month showed that 1988 grain 
production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year heat and 
drought have dried up pastures and forced many producers to thin 
out herds to cut down on rising feed costs 
prices of some major commodities are based on midmonth averages 
and then are revised the following month when additional 
information is available 
john buche of the departments national agricultural statistics 
service said the july report did not reflect most of the recent 
downturn in feed grain and soybean prices after rains improved 
harvest prospects from earlier in the month 
however the market continued to be highly volatile at the 
chicago board of trade on friday crop futures soared after falling 
for nine straight sessions as processors and other users came into 
the market 
by the markets close most corn and soybean futures had risen 
their respective daily limits of 10 cents and 30 cents per bushel 
while the limitless august contract for soybeans soared more than 
34 cents 
the usda report which uses prices at the farm level showed 
that as a commodity group prices of feed grains and hay in great 
demand for livestock in the stricken drought areas rose 16 
percent from june to july averaging 71 percent above a year ago 
prices of food grains mostly wheat but also including rice 
rose 29 percent during the month and averaged 54 percent more than 
in july 1987 
oilbearing crops mostly soybeans were up 85 percent from 
june and averaged 57 percent more than a year ago the report said 
overall the july allcrops price index was up 71 percent from 
june averaging 26 percent above the yearago level 
the july livestock price index was unchanged from june but was 
down 07 percent from july 1987 lower prices for cattle and hogs 
were offset by higher prices for eggs broilers and turkeys 
prices of cattle and calves continued to edge lower partly due 
to many farmers and ranchers being forced by drought to sell 
animals to slaughter plants or feedlots 
beef cattle generally fell to an average of 6360 per 
hundredweight in july down 140 from june 
the price index for poultry and eggs collectively rose 19 
percent from june to july and averaged 32 percent more than a year 
ago 
although the projections are subject to review as more is known 
about 1988 crop and livestock production usda economists say now 
that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 53 billion 
to 59 billion this year down from the record level of 56 billion 
in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts and cash 
expenses during the calendar year 
consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent 
this year compared with a 42 percent average increase in 1987 
before the drought took hold usda was predicting a 1988 food price 
hike of 2 percent to 4 percent 
department officials have predicted that the drought may add 2 
percentage points to food prices in 1989 above the expected 
increase in inflation currently forecast at around 4 percent that 
could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 
7 percent 
the report also included new quarterly figures showing that farm 
production costs in july were up 24 percent from april averaging 
49 percent more than in july 1987 higher prices for feed and 
gasoline were only partially offset by lower prices for feeder 
livestock 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6360520 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally down from 65 in june but up from 6110 reported for 
july 1987 those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4410 per 100 pounds compared with 4710 in 
june and 5960 a year earlier 
corn at 289 a bushel was up from 241 in june and the 
average of 160 per bushel a year earlier 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 346 per bushel compared with 336 in june and 232 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 735 per 100 pounds compared with 729 in june 
and 349 a year earlier 
soybeans were 887 per bushel compared with 814 in june and 
525 a year earlier 
upland cotton was reported at 607 cents per pound compared 
with 612 in june and 683 cents in july 1987 
eggs were 578 cents per dozen compared with 457 cents in 
june and 503 cents a year earlier 
milk was 1140 per 100 pounds compared with 1130 in june 
and 12 a year earlier 
broilers were 421 cents per pound live weight compared with 
367 cents in june and 276 cents a year ago

the senate on friday approved a 31 million 
increase in the governments nutrition program for women infants 
and children as part of a 47 billion measure to pay for 
agriculture nutrition and rural development programs for the year 
beginning oct 1 
the lawmakers voted 874 to boost money for the popular wic 
program as they worked through a list of amendments to the overall 
spending measure and made up the cost by trimming spending from a 
whole spectrum of farm programs 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who proposed the increase said 
it would provide benefits to nearly 100000 eligible poor women and 
children who now are left out of the program because of funding 
limits 
the bill would provide about 19 billion for the wic program 
for the coming year an increase of about 125 million over the 
current years level and 31 million more than had been 
recommended by the appropriations committee for next year 
to stay within spending limits for the overall bill the 
increase in wic was paid for with a 07 percent acrosstheboard 
cut on farm programs in the bill 
deconcini argued that while the program provides food 
supplements to about 36 million lowincome pregnant and nursing 
mothers and young children at least that many more are not served 
because the program is underfunded 
sen thad cochran rmiss the senior gop member on the 
agriculture appropriations subcommittee argued against the change 
noting that participation in the program has grown 79 percent since 
1980 and that it already is funded in a very generous way he 
said it would be unfair to other farm programs to impose further 
cuts in order to boost wic spending 
the wic program is popular particularly in an election year 
because it targets one of the most vulnerable groups in the 
population and by providing preventive care helps save money on 
later healthcare costs it provides packages of fortified infant 
formula milk cereal cheese eggs and fruit juices through local 
health clinics 
the money bill passed on a 748 final vote now goes to a 
housesenate conference committee to work out differences between 
the senate version and one passed by the house on june 16 the 
house bill makes available 3 billion less than the senate version 
among differences between the two versions is a house provision 
putting a 250000 cap on loans to honey producers some of whom 
collect large federal payments for selling their surplus honey to 
the government the senate dropped that provision from its bill 
the reagan administration is opposed to the overall spending 
bill on numerous grounds and the presidents top advisers have 
vowed to recommend a veto if it is not changed before being sent to 
the white house 
among its objections the administration lists a provision that 
requires the government to base its costbenefit calculations for 
irrigation projects on the subsidized value of surplus crops that 
will be grown on the irrigated land rather than the value of the 
crops before subsidies 
the requirement produces a double subsidy problem which the 
administration has been trying to eliminate according to a 
statement from the office of management and budget 
the bill also reinstates a list of programs the administration 
has sought to eliminate including rural housing loans and grants 
and agricultural research and extension programs 
among its provisions the senate bill makes available 
125 billion for farm programs including crop subsidies crop 
insurance agricultural research and extension 
124 billion in rural development programs including farmers 
home administration loans reimbursements to the rural 
electrification administration and soil conservation programs 
162 billion for domestic food assistance including 134 
billion for the food stamp program 46 billion for child 
nutrition and 50 million for the temporary emergency food 
assistance program 
12 billion for foreign programs including food for peace and 
subsidies to encourage exports of us agricultural products 
534 million for the food and drug administration and 355 
million for the commodity futures trading commission

the cases of about 400 people 
imprisoned during the 1956 anticommunist uprising that was crushed 
by soviet tanks will be reviewed by the end of august a justice 
ministry official said friday 
the reviews could lead to amnesty and permission to travel 
abroad for some of the 400 
but jenoe laszlo head of the ministrys legislation drafting 
department also was quoted by the newspaper magyar nemzet as 
saying those who were convicted of high treason or espionage for 
their acts between oct 23 1956 and may 1 1957 would be excluded 
from the planned amnesty 
laszlo said amnesty would not be considered for those convicted 
of committing common crimes such as homicide robbery and acts 
causing danger to the public during that period the newspaper 
reported 
the revolt began in october 1956 with demonstrations demanding a 
new government and that soviet troops leave hungary on nov 4 
1956 about 42 million soviet troopers and 2500 tanks struck at 
budapest 
karoly grosz premier and communist party leader said last week 
during a us visit that his government was preparing a measure to 
remove travel restrictions for those sentenced for having played a 
role in the uprising he said the proposal could affect 400 people 
police can deny exit visas to people who have a criminal record 
hungarians generally have greater freedom of travel under 
regulations approved jan 1 they allow passport holders to travel 
to the west as often as they can afford within the countrys 
currency restrictions 
seven dissidents went on a hunger strike last week however to 
protest what they said were arbitrary decisions by police over who 
receives a passport most of the hunger strikers have been refused 
permission to travel abroad for allegedly violating hungarian 
regulations on previous trips 
jenoe fonay one of the hunger strikers was involved in the 
1956 revolt and could be affected by the new ruling 
grosz said that among the cases to be reconsidered would be 
those of people who had been refused amnesty earlier because of 
political affiliation with the leaders of the 1956 uprising 
but grosz has steadfastly ruled out rehabilitation of the 
leaders of the revolt including imre nagy who was the communist 
party leader at the time his trial and execution were announced in 
1958 
laszlo said those who were sentenced to fiveyear prison terms 
or less following the uprising were given amnesties after their 
release in the late 1950s or early 1960s 
those who served more than five years will have to apply for the 
invalidation of their criminal record he said 
about 20000 people jailed during and after the revolt were 
released in a general amnesty in 1962

embarrassment of his primary campaign toured a general motors 
truck assembly plant to underscore his pledge to work for full 
employment and his call for private and government investment in 
modernizing industry and creating new jobs

united auto workers president owen bieber and michigans two 
senators carl levin and don riegle

national security to greed and corruption dukakis said 
in the plant dukakis was greeted warmly by workers and 
presented a maroon jacket with the uaw name and duke for 
president embroidered on the back

the people of this country to make our industrial base and 
manufacturing industries competitive again he said

of work both jackson and another primary rival rep richard 
gephardt had traveled to that closed flint plant for speeches last 
spring

cited his plan to spend half a billion dollars investing in

the days and nights of molly dodd the 
critically praised series dropped by nbc for low ratings is moving 
next year to the lifetime cablevision network lifetime announced 
friday 
molly dodd was nominated thursday for three emmy awards 
including blair brown for best lead actress in a comedy 
pat fili lifetimes senior vice president of programming 
called molly dodd the perfect show for us lifetime is 
geared toward female viewers molly dodd is a bittersweet 
comedy about a divorced woman in her late 30s living in new york 
we expect this show will flourish in its move from network to 
its new home on cable where the talent will have more creative 
freedom and less restrictions said fili 
in january lifetime will begin airing the 26 episodes already 
produced and has contracted for 13 new episodes that will begin 
running in the spring 
the acquisition marks the first time since the usa network 
continued production of airwolf two years ago that cable has 
continued production on a show canceled by a network 
lifetimes purchase of molly is significant in view of the 
decline in network ratings and higher cable viewership 
jay tarses the creator and executive producer of the show said 
he was thrilled that the show would stay in production 
lifetime is doing something that could be very revolutionary 
could signal a new age in television for the creative community 
said tarses its another place to go and there should be other 
places to go because this is a show that a lot of people wanted to 
watch and the network said there just werent enough people 
tarses had been critical of nbc entertainment president brandon 
tartikoffs taste in programming after nbc moved the show around 
the schedule and complained about its low ratings but tarses 
avoided criticizing tartikoff anew 
i think hes one of the most intelligent men in the united 
states tarses said getting a big laugh from tv critics 
attending the news conference 
i said some things when all this was going on at nbc because i 
was very upset about what had happened but it all had to do with 
the emotion of the moment he said 
tarses also produced the slap maxwell story on abc it was 
dropped after a season an earlier tarses coproduction buffalo 
bill became a cult hit in reruns on cable it too received 
critical praise on the network but was canceled due to low ratings 
tarses said he had to be convinced that a move to cable was 
worthwhile but is now sold on the idea 
this could be the answer for people like me he said 
maybe cable is exactly where we should be franks place on 
cbs got nine emmy nominations but last week it was 72 in the 
nielsen rankings 
i dont want molly to die and this looks like genuine life 
to me 
tarses said the show would be produced in new york instead of 
los angeles and that production would resume in january the show 
is unaffected by the writers strike because the production company 
has an independent contract with the writers guild 
tarses said brown was shooting a movie in london and he had not 
talked to her but i think she feels the same way i do about 
moving the show to cable

an organization of iranian guerrillas fighting 
to overthrow ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said friday it had held 
two towns in iran for three days this week and killed or wounded 
40000 troops loyal to khomeini 
the national liberation army of iran is now withdrawing from the 
towns of islamadab and karand southwest of tehran said dr aladin 
pouran a representative of the yearold organization 
in three days of fighting the nla forces caused 40000 
casualties and shot down two f4 phantom jets and two cobra 
helicopter gunships pouran told a news conference 
heavy fighting continued incessantly until friday morning 
between nla forces and khomeinis revolutionary guards at different 
points along the front from the border region to the 
islamabadkermanshah highway pouran said 
meanwhile state department spokesman charles e redman called 
for restraint by all parties in the conflict 
he said the nla formed in june 1987 as the military arm of the 
mojaheddin operates with the support of iraq and seeks the violent 
overthrow of the iranian government 
our view is that peace will require that both sides refrain 
from interfering in the internal affairs of the other redman 
said 
once again the spokesman sidestepped questions about iraqs 
insistence on direct negotiations with iran 
both sides have indicated that they seek a negotiated 
settlement but getting there is going to require patience and 
flexibility he said we have been in close contact with the 
united nations secretarygeneral and with members of the security 
council to lend our support to this process and will continue to 
do that

vice president george bushs decision against 
addressing the national urban league next week is a serious 
miscalculation that could hurt him among black voters the 
president of the group said friday 
i believe it is a critical error on the part of the bush 
campaign to not come and address this group john e jacob said 
we did not offer the invitation because we needed someone to come 
fill up a slot we can get speakers to come to the urban league 
the 5000 largely middle class and affluent blacks gathering for 
the leagues annual conference will hear from democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis on monday night and from jesse 
jackson on wednesday 
new york congressman jack kemp who sought the gop nomination 
until bush plled away from the field during the primaries is part 
of a tuesday night panel discussion on the 1988 election 
i would not care to characterize it as an insult jacob said 
of the bush campaigns action we believe it is important to 
anyone who in 1988 believes that he will occupy the white house to 
recognize that the black vote is critical to that obviously the 
people who were advising the vice president and the vice president 
himself disagree with that 
sheila tate a spokeswoman for bushs campaign in washington 
did not return two phone calls seeking comment 
jacob said the profile of the average league member 
characterized as a 34to54 year old collegeeducated black 
earning at least 30000 a year made the league a good forum for 
a gop candidate the league itself is nonpartisan 
youve got to appreciate the profile because if there are any 
black folks in america who just might be sensitive to giving an 
audience to the vice president it would be a group with this 
profile jacob said the fact that they do not have an 
appreciation for this profile not only sends a message to this 
group but it sends even a greater message to the group that doesnt 
fit that profile 
its in his best interest to present his case to black 
america jacob said the fact that he obviously feels he can 
get elected without it i think is a serious miscalculation on his 
part

a human rights lawyer accused the justice 
department friday of setting up mariel cuban detainees for unfair 
treatment with a proposal that immigration judges be allowed to 
ignore evidence of persecution in some asylum cases 
arthur helton director of the political asylum project of the 
lawyers committee for human rights said the proposal appears to be 
an effort to expedite denial of asylum to the mariel cubans many 
of whom have criminal records in the united states 
under the proposed regulation judges would not need to inquire 
into the nature of a wellfounded fear of persecution in the 
home country of an asylum applicant who had committed a 
particularly serious crime in the united states 
the justice department says the serious crimes include murder 
drug trafficking armed robbery and rape 
but helton said refugees with us convictions for burglary 
weapons possession simple assault and marijuana possession could 
be affected too helton is director of the political asylum project 
of the lawyers committee for human rights 
about 2600 cubans mostly criminals and mental patients sent 
by cuban leader fidel castro in a 1980 boatlift from the port of 
mariel are detained in the united states nearly 1500 are being 
held in federal prisons said rick kenney a spokesman for the us 
immigration and naturalization service 
the real target of this proposal seems to be the cuban 
marielitos who remain in immigration custody said helton the 
justice department wants to expedite the denial of any asylum 
applications filed by the cubans many of whom have criminal 
histories in the united states so that they can be deported 
quickly back to cuba 
the proposal is absolutely not targeted at the mariel 
cubans although it would have application to some mariels 
said steven r valentine a deputy assistant attorney general in 
the justice departments civil division 
the regulation was prompted by an 11th us circuit court of 
appeals opinion not by the prospect of mariel cubans seeking 
asylum valentine said 
the basic purpose is the prevention of unnecessary delays in 
the removal of all aliens regardless of nationality who have 
committed particularly serious crimes said valentine 
the cases of the 2600 cubans are being reviewed by the ins to 
determine whether to release them or to detain them 
about 70 cuban detainees have been served with deportation 
notices said gary leshaw a lawyer in atlanta who has represented 
many of the mariel cubans filing an asylum application is one step 
to avoid being repatriated to a home country 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled dec 31 that under 
an existing justice department regulation asylum applicants are 
entitled to present their evidence and to have their claim of 
persecution considered by immigration judges in deportation and 
exclusion proceedings despite the fact that the applicants may 
have serious criminal convictions 
the new proposal which is open for public comment until aug 
26 would close that opportunity 
the 11th circuit case arauz versus rivkind involved a 
nicaraguan man who had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with 
intent to distribute marijuana he had been arrested aboard a 
fishing vessel carrying more than 4000 pounds of marijuana 
the proposal also would cover refugees with a wellfounded fear 
of persecution who have participated in the persecution of others 
or who pose a danger to the security of the united states 
the proposal is part of a comprehensive rulemaking which 
involves revamping asylum procedures in line with a 1987 supreme 
court ruling ins versus cardozafonseca the justice department 
plans to complete the comprehensive rulemaking later

with mixed feelings of warmth and caution moscow 
jews welcomed the first israeli diplomats to visit the soviet union 
in 21 years to sabbath prayers at sundown friday 
shalom shouted the burly bearded delegation head meron 
gordon as he and the five other israelis met a crowd of 60 jews 
and reporters outside moscows choral synagogue 
the soviet jews replied with shouts of shalom a hebrew word 
that means both hello and peace 
the diplomats four of them sovietborn flew to moscow thursday 
for a twomonth visit they are to inspect the former israeli 
embassy in moscow and review the dutch embassys processing of 
requests by soviet jews for israeli visas 
it is the first such mission to the soviet union since 1967 
when the kremlin broke relations with the jewish state to protest 
israels occupation of arab territories in the 1967 middle east war 
inside the synagogue gordon 41 who emigrated from the soviet 
union in 1957 chatted in hebrew with the soviet unions chief 
rabbi adolf shayevich 
this is really special for us gordon told journalists 
every synagogue for us is the crucial point the crossroads where 
the jewish community meets 
he and the other israelis wearing the traditional skullcap the 
yarmulke took seats for sabbath prayers 
many of the soviet jews said they learned of the planned visit 
to the synagogue from radio newscasts on voice of america and from 
israel 
several soviet jews outside the synagogue on central moscows 
arkhipova street told reporters friday night that they want to 
emigrate 
a 28yearold man who identified himself only as arya said he 
had warm feelings toward the israeli visitors but was 
concerned they had come in part to enforce a new israeli policy 
limiting the options of jews who want to leave 
the israeli cabinet ordered a change in procedure in june that 
would force most emigrating soviet jews to go to israel under 
current rules most emigres can choose where they want to resettle 
and most go to the united states 
arya said he just received soviet permission to emigrate with 
his wife and 2yearold daughter and might prefer some other 
country than israel in which to settle 
boris chernobylsky a prominent refusenik or soviet jew refused 
permission to emigrate told a reporter he doubted the israeli 
diplomats would push for freer emigration 
they are afraid of soviet authorities and want to please 
them he said 
shayevich who some jews say is under the tutelage of the 
government told reporters he believes most soviet jews who want to 
leave have already emigrated he said the soviet government has a 
legitimate right to force people to stay if they had access to 
classified material 
from january to june 6017 soviet jews emigrated last year 
the soviet union allowed 8011 jews to leave 
the rabbi said he hoped the israeli mission would lead 
eventually to restoration of diplomatic relations with the soviet 
union 
the kremlin says it wont restore ties until israel withdraws 
from the occupied lands and agrees to an international mideast 
peace conference

department said friday 
the latest total was down 1 percent from 1095 million head a 
year earlier and 4 percent fewer than the 1122 million of two

herd has been shrinking for six years

head a 27year low and the first time that the jan 1 count had 
been less than 100 million since 1961

million head up fractionally from 1987 but down 2 percent from 
1986

calves and dairy cattle as well as beef stock included these 
categories compared with the last two years respectively

injunction issued july 21 by us district court judge harry h 
maclaughlin in st paul minn however they left the door open for 
a possible appeal of the courts order

implementing notices issued by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service to county offices concerning

be eligible for storage in the agencys farmerowned reserve

the additional months storage will be made when farmers settle 
their loans

democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen said friday that republican george bush had been slow 
to recognize the need for more child care but he also said the 
vice presidents proposal on the subject was a step in the right 
direction 
that was a kinder verdict than democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis gave during a news conference while campaigning in 
wisconsin dukakis said of bushs proposal i dont know of 
anyone who is seriously concerned about child care who thinks that 
makes sense 
bentsen flew back to his native texas to complete a threeday 
campaign swing his first solo tour since receiving his nomination 
last week at the democratic national convention with a rally and 
news conference in amarillo he was campaigning hard on the home 
turf of his senaterace opponent rep beau boulter 
he told reporters he was going full bore on both of his 
candidacies and intended to spend all the money he raised for his 
senate race on that contest despite republican complaints that it 
was unfair texas law allows bentsen to run for both offices at 
once 
earlier friday bentsen visited a statesubsidized day care 
center at the ucla campus posing with preschoolers and listening 
to parents and employees questions about why there was not more 
federal day care help 
one mother getting her degree in education told him that her 
whole eight years of education is more or less down the drain 
until her child is old enough to go to school since she wont be 
able to afford day care once she leaves the campus program 
were beginning to make some headway were really beginning 
to see some attention given to this issue bentsen said citing 
his involvement last year in creating a commission to study 
childrens issues in congress 
bentsen told reporters afterward that the reagan administration 
had fought him last year when he earmarked 50 million for federal 
day care subsidies to local government he said bushs 22 billion 
proposal amounted to a conversion 
i think the bush proposal is a step in the right direction and 
im delighted to see them get aboard on this issue said bentsen 
who as chairman of the senate finance committee reviews any changes 
in tax law they have not been very supportive of these kinds of 
efforts over the past eight years 
asked if he supported the bush plans tax credits to mothers who 
stay home with their children bentsen declined to comment saying 
he wasnt familiar with the details he pointed out that sen 
christopher dodd dconn had drafted a competing plan with 
subsidies and standards for day care centers 
dukakis has said he supports the senate democrats legislation 
in principle 
the ucla center available for students and employees of the 
university is heavily subsidized with parents paying part or none 
of the cost depending on their income the center has an annual 
budget of 650000 and there are 77 youngsters enrolled said 
administrator david menninger 
the most a parent pays is 440 a month which is less than 
twothirds the cost for care at the center which is just off sunset 
blvd 
bentsen predicted congress would eventually approve a blend of 
the different child care proposals including some tax credits and 
some subsidies 
sen and mrs bentsen who have three children and five 
grandchildren spent about 15 minutes with the children some of 
whom were frightened by the media commotion others seemed to enjoy 
the scene 
the 67yearold texas democrat dressed in a suit suitable for 
the senate chamber bounced a boy on his knee telling him 
rideem cowboy he also got closeup looks at a wide variety 
of plastic dinosaurs 
on another subject bentsen who is chairman of the senate 
finance committee praised nicholas brady who has been widely 
reported as the next treasury secretary if and when james baker iii 
leaves that job to take over as bushs campaign chairman 
bentsen said he expected there would be little opposition to 
brady whose nomination would have to be cleared by his committee 
though baker is still in his job and no nomination of brady has 
been announced bentsen spoke as if the changes had been put in 
motion 
i think thats a good choice he said nick served in the 
united states senate he was appointed to that job and served there 
a few months made a lot of friends im very pleased to see the 
choice hes a man who has broad experience in the area and i think 
will bring a lot to the job

a cancer patient who said he must smoke 
marijuana to avoid starvation was convicted friday of possessing 7 
ounces of marijuana but jurors fined him only 1 and ordered no 
jail time 
the johnson district court jury followed the recommendation of 
assistant county attorney tom blaha who had urged them to show 
compassion 
the maximum penalty that could have been levied was 90 days in 
jail and a 250 fine 
the trial that began thursday was the first time a cancer 
patient has mounted a medical defense against a marijuana charge 
although people suffering from glaucoma and other disorders have 
done so said kevin zeese a lawyer for the drug policy foundation 
based in washington dc 
rick morris 31 was a truck driver who weighed nearly 200 
pounds in march 1987 when doctors detected a large tumor wrapped 
around his brain stem said ned pillersdorf morris attorney 
his weight dropped below 125 pounds by the time therapy 
concluded he said until morris began smoking marijuana even the 
smell of food would cause him to vomit pillersdorf said 
after the radiation and chemotherapy stopped things were 
getting worse instead of better pillersdorf told jurors when 
he made a decision to smoke marijuana he made a decision to save 
his life 
morris was arrested in november after officers saw a bag of 
marijuana on a table at his apartment when they responded to a 
medical emergency there blaha said 
officers returned later with a search warrant and confiscated 7 
ounces of marijuana some pills and marijuana paraphernalia blaha 
said 
a defense witness from the drug policy foundation daniel 
dansak a psychiatrist teaching at the university of south alabama 
told jurors that marijuana is the best drug to help cancer patients 
deal with the side effects of radiation treatments and chemotherapy 
kentucky is not among the 34 states that have legalized 
marijuana for medical purposes county attorney scott preston said 
in may that he did not want to inflict more pain on morris but 
if they want to change the laws the place to do it is in the 
legislature

the scriptwriters strike will delay tv guide 
magazines fall preview issue three weeks and even then the weekly 
magazines topselling issue may not be uptodate the editor said 
friday 
this may be the year tv guide does a newseason issue and 
theres no new season said editor dave sendler 
the 21week strike by scriptwriters has halted hollywood 
production and jeopardized the fall television season negotiators 
for the scriptwriters and the television and film producers engaged 
in contract talks this week under a news blackout 
last years tv guide fall preview issue sold more than 18 
million copies the magazine based in suburban philadelphia has a 
circulation of 164 million said spokeswoman julianne hastings 
the fall preview issue offers onepage glances at the networks 
new programs with photographs of key characters and comments on 
the story lines delays in getting the photographs and information 
for the stories have pushed the publication from sept 10 to oct 1 
were going to do the best we can were going up to the last 
minute sendler said we could get caught 
television casts and crews are usually producing new episodes at 
this time making it easy for photographers to get the pictures 
they need sendler said 
but with production halted by the strike magazine staff members 
have been forced to find props and set up many of the shots that 
would typically be taken in a studio sendler said 
things also have been difficult for the magazines senior 
editor myles callum who writes all the show summaries for the 
preview section 
callum begins writing about new falls shows in the spring after 
watching the pilot episodes for the preview issue he reviews 
scripts made available by the networks but this year there are no 
writers and no scripts to help him with his writing 
viewers are usually bombarded with 20 or more new shows at the 
beginning of the season but sendler said some of the shows slated 
for the preview issue may never make it to television this fall 
because of the strike 
the magazine will be able to make changes in the preview issue 
up to its sept 7 deadline after that the new fall lineup of 
shows is set on paper whether or not the programs ever make it on 
the air 
in the meantime the magazines sept 3 issue is a survivors 
guide offering the best you can do for fresh programming in 
september and october sendler said 
members of the writers guild of america have been on strike 
since march 7 issues in the impasse are payments for reruns of 
onehour television shows rebroadcast domestically and all shows 
rebroadcast overseas

the federal communications commission must 
reconsider an order that broadcasters can only air programs with 
indecent content from midnight to 6 am a federal appeals 
court ruled friday 
the ruling said the fcc failed to make a case for those specific 
hours but in a victory for the agency affirmed its right to 
regulate programming to protect children 
the unanimous threejudge panel of the us court of appeals 
also upheld the commissions definition of indecent material on 
radio and television 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said after the ruling i intend 
to respond promptly to the courts question regarding those 
specific times by recommending the initiation of a commission 
proceeding 
the commissions midnight6 am policy adopted in 1987 was a 
change from a 1978 policy which only allowed programs with indecent 
material to be aired on television or radio from 10 pm to 6 am 
the fcc made the switch because it believed many children were 
still awake between 10 pm and midnight 
broadcasters program suppliers and public interest groups 
challenged the new time restraint saying the programs with adult 
content could only be aired when most listeners were asleep they 
said this violated the first amendment by denying adults access to 
constitutionally protected material 
the petitioners also challenged the definition of indecent 
programs as too vague 
the court said that in view of the curtailment of broadcaster 
freedom and adult listener choice the commission failed to 
consider fairly and fully what time lines should be drawn 
the judges said that in the three radio shows used as test 
cases the commission cited population figures that estimated the 
number of teens in the total listening audience 
there was no indication of the size of the predicted audience 
for the specific radio stations in question the court said 
more troubling the fcc ventures no explanation why it takes 
teens aged 1217 to be the relevant age group for channeling 
purposes the court said 
the judges noted that in 1976 the fcc was mainly interested in 
preventing children under 12 from seeing or hearing the indecent 
material 
we agree the fccs midnight advice indeed its entire position 
on the time restriction was not adequately thought through 
the judges said 
thus the fcc must endeavor to determine what rule will 
most effectively promote parental as distinguished from 
government control 
patrick said he was delighted that the court has 
unquestionably affirmed the commissions authority to regulate the 
broadcast of indecent material permitting parents to control their 
childrens access to sexually explicit programs 
the indecency definition that was upheld was adopted by the fcc 
from a supreme court ruling it defines indecent programming as 
exposure of children to language that depicts or 
describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary 
community standards for the broadcast medium sexual or excretory 
activities or organs 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television in 
cambridge mass praised the ruling 
she commented the case says it wasnt a good idea to close 
down the window on indecency from 10 o clock to midnight we think 
that limits speech important to the public 
the ruling was written by us circuit judge ruth b ginsburg 
concurring were circuit judges spottswood w robinson iii and david 
sentelle

nelson mandela the imprisoned 
leader of the african national congress and his family were not 
the targets of an arson attack that destroyed their home mandelas 
attorney asserted friday 
attorney ismail ayob said he had an idea of what prompted 
the attack but that he had to honor mandelas request that no 
statement be made 
mr mandela was not the target the family was not the 
target ayob told a news conference after spending the night 
talking to youths in soweto a black township oustide johannesburg 
he said mandela had sent a message from pollsmoor prison saying 
there should be no prosecutions no witchhunts for thursdays 
attack on the mandela home mandela 70 is serving a life sentence 
after being convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrow 
the government 
ayob also disputed a claim by robert j brown a businessman 
from high point nc who said he had been given power of attorney 
by the mandelas to protect their interests 
the attorney said the mandela family would not file a complaint 
with police about the arson attack and would work with community 
leaders to try to bring peace and avoid reprisals 
he called laughable a report that police were investigating 
the possibility that the african national congress rival guerrilla 
group the pan africanist congress may have been involved in the 
arson 
ayob would not respond to questions about reports by black 
journalists that teenagers who guard the mandela house had been 
involved in a dispute with students at a nearby high school over a 
girl the reports said about 40 youths including some wearing 
jackets from the high school attacked the house after one or more 
students were beaten by members of the group guarding the home 
ayob said the modest fourroom bungalow in which the mandela 
family has lived since the 1940s would be rebuilt and the work was 
expected to take a few weeks 
mrs mandela her youngest daughter zindzi and two 
grandchildren who lived in the house were away at the time of the 
attack 
ayob challenged statements by brown who after visiting mandela 
in prison announced that he had been given the power of attorney 
to represent the familys interests worldwide and to prevent 
concerts and other events from being staged in the mandela name by 
people with no connection to the family 
brown made the announcement last week outside the prison with 
mrs mandela standing beside him 
ayob read to the news conference a statement he said had been 
dictated by mandela 
it said in part mr robert brown does not represent the 
mandela familys interests in any way it said that at the july 
23 meeting with brown mandela had firmly rejected the 
suggestion that brown be given power of attorney and said any 
matter related to the family would only be dealt with by the 
african national congress 
the anc is the main guerrilla organization fighting south 
africas whitecontrolled government 
ayob said he discussed the issue with mrs mandela thursday 
night after her house burned down and she agreed to the contents 
of the statement he released 
however american publicist armstrong williams a colleague of 
brown said mrs mandela had called him in north carolina and asked 
him to announce on her behalf its nonsense what ayob said 
everything he said was exaggerated 
the anc issued a statement from its headquarters in lusaka 
zambia supporting ayob and saying browns claims are proved as 
false 
brown has known the mandelas for more than two years he has 
paid for their eldest daughter zenani and her husband to attend 
boston university 
he said from his johannesburg hotel room that mrs mandela and 
zindzi were with him during the discussion with mandela in the 
prison cell and ayob has no one to corroborate his statement 
purportedly from mandela 
brown said the family asked me to do something mrs mandela 
has asked me to stop the ripoff of the mandela family name as 
long as the family wants me to do something about that i will do 
that with vigor

a sailor who said he dropped out of the 
navy rescue swimmer school because he feared for his life will 
retake the course that was revamped after the death of a recruit 
petty officer 2nd class phil nazzaro 27 an electronics 
technician at miramar naval air station in san diego said friday 
that navy officials made their offer last month shortly after he 
talked to the news media about the school 
airman recruit lee mirecki 19 of appleton wis died march 2 
during a training exercise at pensacola naval air station 
the navy barred instructors from touching students after an 
instructor was accused of holding mireckis head under water 
causing him to panic and literally die of fright according to 
testimony in an investigative hearing 
my command wasnt aware of what i went through nazzaro told 
the pensacola news journal they were real sympathetic and 
helpful 
nazzaro said he dropped out of the school last summer three 
days before graduation after he nearly drowned during a training 
exercise called sharks and daisies he said he decided to speak 
out about the experience after mireckis death 
the day of his death mirecki panicked climbed out of the 
training pool and shouted that he was quitting but instructors 
pushed him back in the water where he collapsed and died a 
pathologist said mirecki had a phobia of being dragged under water 
which triggered heart failure followed by drowning 
the navy shut down the school a few weeks after the recruit 
died a curriculum review resulted in the ban against instructors 
touching students and abolished the sharksanddaisies drill 
during which instructors played the roles of panicked aircrash 
survivors and would randomly put headholds on students who were 
trying to rescue them the student was to pull the instructor under 
water to break the hold then place him in a rescue carry 
the changes also require students to immediately be removed from 
a drill if they ask to quit in the past instructors would force 
trainees to complete an exercise before allowing them to withdraw 
nazzaro said he didnt expect the navy to go as far as it did in 
its curriculum changes 
i think theyre long overdue and they sound great to me he 
said 
nazzaro said if he passes the course he can reclaim the 
helicopter antisubmarine warfare rating he lost when he dropped 
out of rescue swimmer training

the defense department has been notified that 
the boeing co is running behind schedule for delivery of the new 
air force one the jet that carries the president 
air force capt michael laughlin said friday that the 
manufacturer had set a goal a long time ago of trying to get 
delivery by nov 30 
but its a oneofakind sort of plane the spokesman said 
in a telephone interview 
he said boeing told pentagon officials it was having technical 
difficulties with the installation of wiring bundles and the 
availability of parts associated with the interior wiring 
loughlin said that boeing is going to announce soon a new 
delivery date and administration officials hope the widebodied 
boeing 747 jet will be ready in time for some use by president 
reagan 
at the white house james c mckinney director of the military 
office said presidential aides hope boeing can have the plane 
ready at least by jan 20 1989 inauguration day 
reagan and his wife nancy would then get to use the new 
aircraft to fly to their home in california 
asked if it appeared the aircraft would not be ready by 
midjanuary mckinney said not so far but everybodys got their 
fingers crossed 
meanwhile the air force is building a new hangar kitchen to 
replace the one at andrews air force base in suburban maryland that 
has been used so far to prepare inflight meals for passengers of 
the presidential jet 
because the larger boeing 747 will allow the seating of 93 
people on the custommade jet compared to 69 seats on the existing 
boeing 707 the air force must have a hangar kitchen capable of 
turning out as many as 4000 meals at a time for air force one and 
another boeing 747 that flies as its backup 
the custommade presidential jet has a private compartment for 
the chief executive as well as a flying office and separate 
compartments for aides guests secret service agents and traveling 
reporters 
laughlin acknowledged that it would be unlikely that air force 
one and its traveling companion the backup boeing 747 would ever 
need as many as 4000 meals 
but he said that capability is based on a worstcase 
requirement and that it represents the amount of foodserving 
capacity that would be necessary if 93 passengers aboard each 
aircraft made a sevenday trip and had three meals per day 
laughlin said the construction of an enlarged kitchen at the 
andrews air force base hangar was necessitated by the need to keep 
a larger volume of meals ready for loading onto the planes 
you can make the prepackaged meals in about the same space 
but its storing them thats the problem he said

moved to a training area at decimomannu on the mediterranean island 
of sardinia scholz said 
since march 31 five us air force f16 jet fighters have 
crashed on training flights over west german territory including

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
friday that democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis is 
for a weaker defense 
fitzwater made the comment after a visiting west german 
conservative leader franz joseph strauss said at the white house 
every american president will provide the same policy regardless 
of who wins the presidential election 
strauss speaking with reporters after a meeting with president 
reagan said the guidelines of american policy will remain 
unchanged 
however presidential spokesman fitzwater said we have great 
differences with the democratic nominee in terms of defense posture 
he basically is for a weaker defense and cutting defense and 
we are for a strong defense he is for reducing commitments all 
around the world it would seem so i would simply ask that anyone 
take a pretty close look at mr dukakis foreign policy and defense 
policies and they can judge for themselves 
the dukakis campaign was quick to respond marlin fitzwater 
must be consulting the white house astrologer on dukakis position 
on defense said senior campaign adviser kirk odonnell

the united states will keep providing aid to 
palestinian arabs through private relief groups while it seeks an 
explanation from jordan for abandoning a special development 
program on the west bank and in gaza 
these projects enhance the wellbeing and economic development 
of the palestinian people state department spokesman charles e 
redman said friday 
us contributions this year are expected to total 7 million 
jordan announced on thursday it was canceling the development 
program in a move to give more responsibility over the 15 million 
palestinians in the israeliheld territories to the palestine 
liberation organization 
a jordanian statement in amman said the kingdom was taking the 
step in response to plo demands 
the program which exists largely on paper is a 13 billion 
plan for which the united states contributed 55 million in 1986 
14 million in 1987 and 57 million this year 
italy has contributed about 20 million and britain a lesser 
amount 
the plan had the enthusiastic support of secretary of state 
george p shultz as a means of improving the quality of life on 
the west bank and in gaza and also had the endorsement of israel 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it 
was not clear whether the fund would be canceled turned over to 
the plo or operated in some other way 
the state department avoided any criticism of jordans decision 
i dont have any reaction other than to say that were 
consulting with the government of jordan regarding the announcement 
and how it intends to implement the decision redman said 
he said assistant secretary of state richard w murphy would 
take up the issue with jordanian leaders when he is in amman next 
month murphy also will visit egypt israel and syria and has urged 
palestinians to meet with him 
while king husseins decision was widely interpreted as at least 
a partial withdrawal from the west bank the state department said 
it was too early to make any analysis 
i just dont have any way to further evaluate the impact of 
the jordanian decision and thats why were going to talk to them 
about how this decision is going to be implemented redman said 
asked if the united states would keep making contributions if 
the fund were run by the plo the us official said obviously 
not 
shultz is counting on hussein to support a us plan for peace 
talks with israel that would exclude the plo but include 
palestinians in a jordanian delegation 
hussein and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir have not 
endorsed the plan but shultz is expected to make a fifth 
peaceseeking trip to the region in the fall to solicit their 
support 
we dont interpret this announcement that were talking about 
as any lessening of jordans intention to remain actively involved 
in the peace process redman said

a ransom note left by the kidnapper of an 
ailing woman indicates the abduction may have been an act of 
revenge against her wealthy husband a psychiatrist said 
annie l hearin 72 was reported missing by her husband robert 
hearin tuesday night shortly before he found the note which 
demanded an unspecified amount in ransom and instructed him not to 
notify police authorities said 
police spokesman sgt chip pippen said friday that police would 
not be making any statements about the case until there is a major 
development

being wronged the psychiatrist refused to identify the groups 
or give further details

leftist guerrillas sent a message to a 
sparsely attended peace conference friday saying drug traffickers 
should included in the talks because they cause so many problems in 
colombia 
neither the government nor any of colombias six guerrilla 
groups was represented at the conference which the roman catholic 
church sponsored the government had threatened the rebels with 
arrest if appeared 
rebels demanded the peace conference in exchange for releasing a 
former presidential candidate alvaro gomez hurtado he was 
abducted may 29 by the april 19 movement known as m19 and held 
for 53 days 
guerrillas and a representative of president virgilio barco sent 
messages to the conference about 60 people attended including 
church officials 20 congressmen and business leaders 
the nations smallest guerrilla group the workers 
revolutionary party said in a message that drug traffickers should 
attend because they are the main factors of destabilization of 
colombia 
other guerrilla groups said they would not surrender their 
weapons as long as the army wages what the insurgents call a dirty 
war 
hundreds of people have disappeared and death squads have killed 
more than 800 leftists in three years 
guerrillas also demand that gen rafael samudio be fired as 
defense minister and replaced by a civilian 
cardenal alfonso lopez trujillo said in a speech the rebels must 
show sincerity in any negotiations arising from the peace 
conference and make some concrete gestures that demonstrate 
willingness to end bloodshed 
a ceasefire negotiated with some guerrilla groups in 1982 
collapsed over the next two years with rebels and army blaming 
each other for truce violations the army said the guerrillas 
tricked the government into peace negotiations to give themselves 
time to recuperate from military setbacks 
barco spokesman rafael pardo said in a message to fridays 
conference the boycott does not mean the government refuses to talk 
with the guerrillas 
he said talks should lead not to just living together with the 
guerrillas but should have a goal of bringing the rebels into 
the legal political process 
pardo is barcos adviser on talks dealings with guerrillas and 
has met several times with leaders of the colombian revolutionary 
armed forces the countrys largest guerrilla group with an 
estimated 500010000 combatants 
in his message pardo asked the guerrillas to say what the 
government would have to do to get them to end 30 years of 
insurrection 
gomez was released despite the governments refusal to agree to 
be host for the conference the catholic church which helped 
negotiate gomezs freedom organized the conference and gomez 
attended it 
all of colombias six living former presidents were invited but 
none attended

an opposition alliance said friday it has 
asked the military to stop officers from campaigning because it 
compromises the forthcoming presidential referendum 
patricio aylwin told a news conference the coalition delivered a 
letter to the military junta tuesday protesting such activity 
aylwin is president of the centrist christian democratic party 
one of 16 political groups that formed the alliance to promote a 
no vote in the referendum 
the government plans a yesorno ballot in october on a single 
candidate who will be nominated at a meeting aug 30 of the army 
navy air force and national police commanders president augusto 
pinochet 72yearold army commander who seized power in 1973 coup 
is expected to be chosen 
several highranking officers who favor pinochets nomination 
have been campaigning at public rallies and in military gatherings 
aylwin said that compromises the legitimacy of the electoral 
process 
chiles constitution charges the armed forces with ensuring the 
impartiality of elections 
the coalitions letter copies of which were given to reporters 
friday said a significant number of officers almost all of them 
from the army have begun to openly carry out an ostensible 
politicalelectoral activity in favor of a yes vote 
it said the officers also were calling on troops in barracks 
speeches to support the candidacy of pinochet whom they descibe 
as the supreme leader or the chieftan of the armed forces with 
a rhetoric similar to that of fascist and other dictatorial 
regimes 
the referendum will be the first presidential ballot since a 
marxist salvador allende won the 1970 electoin gen pinochet 
overthrew him in september 1973 and allende died in the coup 
if a majority votes for the candidate he will begin an 
eightyear term in march 1989 if he is rejected a pinochet is to 
remain in power until a free election in 1990

a federal appellate court panel ruled 21 
friday that the nations space agency must release the audio tapes 
of the illfated challenger shuttle flight 
the ruling by the us court of appeals here affirmed a lower 
court decision that the tapes should be made public under the 
freedom of information act 
the national aeronautics and space administration had refused to 
give up the tapes saying release would invade the privacy of 
families of the seven astronauts who died in the jan 28 1986 
disaster 
the judges said the tapes cannot be held back under a foia 
exemption that permits withholding of personnel and medical files 
and similar files that constitute a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy 
nasa cited that exemption in refusing to release the taes even 
though it made public written transcripts of the astronauts 
conversations nasa said the tapes contain no new information on 
the flight 
us circuit judge spottswood w robinson iii said in the 
majority opinion that the court had to decide whether the sound of 
the human voice communicating nonpersonal information should be 
considered a similar file that could be withheld 
the court concluded a file is not to be considered similar 
unless at a minimum it contains personal information information 
somehow related to an individuals life 
to call the sound of a human voice personal information 
distorts the plain meaning and common understanding of the phrase 
as such the tape recording of the voices of the astronauts 
without more does not constitute a similar file that could be 
withheld 
robinson said that congress intended that the exemption be 
designed to protect individuals from injury and embarrassment 
resulting from unnecessary disclosure of personal information 
to accept nasas argument would be to hold that every tape 
recording of audible human utterances regardless of its content 
is invariably a similar file because every persons voice is 
essentially unique the ruling said 
us circuit judge harry edwards concurred in the opinion 
in a dissent us circuit judge douglas h ginsburg argued nasa 
should have a chance to show that the tapes would invade the 
privacy of the astronauts families he said the court could not 
make such a determination based on the record as it now exists 
i find it inconceivable that the sound and inflection of a 
persons voice during the last seconds of his or her life is not 
information that somehow relates to an individuals life 
ginsburg said 
whatever insights can be gleaned from their voices whatever 
inferences can be drawn about their thoughts and feelings at the 
very moment of their deaths they are not to be found in that 
transcript if they are anywhere they are in the tape

the government suspended a staterun 
news program friday a newspaper reported in a strange twist in 
the leftist sandinistas crackdown on the nicaraguan press 
the radio sandino news show en directo was suspended for 48 
hours for violating communications law according to an interior 
ministry communique published friday in the government newspaper el 
nuevo diario 
the private news show fabuloso siete said the suspension was 
ordered because of strong criticism by the government program 
of one of the deputy directors of the opposition newspaper la 
prensa 
a radio sandino newswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the suspension stemmed from a commentary made thursday by one 
of the broadcasters of en directo 
the suspension of a staterun program may represent an effort to 
project an image of fairness in the governments series of 
broadcast and newspaper closures it was the first action against a 
staterun news organization 
the crackdown began after government opponents held a big 
demonstration july 10 outside managua police battled protesters 
and arrested about 40 people 
the next day the government complained of media coverage and 
ordered la prensa nicaraguas only opposition newspaper and the 
roman catholic station radio catolica closed la prensa reopened 
wednesday after its 15day suspension but the catholic station was 
closed indefinitely 
a private news show el despertar was also shut down 
indefinitely another private show el noticiero broadcast on 
radio mundial returned to the air this week after a 48hour 
suspension 
also friday el nuevo diario reported that a group of family 
members blocked a road thursday leading to masachapa about 30 
miles southwest of managua to protest recruitment of youths into 
military service 
the newspaper said the demonstration was manipulated by 
certain individuals 
la prensa showed a photograph in its thursday night edition of 
special police forces shoving women 
the twoyear mandatory military service has been bitterly 
opposed by many nicaraguans

a federal judge issued a permanent injunction 
friday against the justice departments drugtesting program under 
which the agency would test 1800 employees who are in sensitive 
law enforcement posts 
us district judge george revercomb initially issued a 
preliminary injunction saying mandatory random drug testing cannot 
be justified because the department does not consider drug use to 
be widespread at the agency 
it is impossible to argue that mandatory random urinalysis 
drug testing serves the purpose of deterring illegal drug use by 
trusted and apparently lawabiding employees revercomb said in a 
14page opinion granting the preliminary injunction 
the judge said the 42 justice department employees who sued in 
an attempt to block the program show a strong likelihood of 
success on their claim that compulsory random urinalysis drug 
testing is an unreasonable search and seizure that violates the 
fourth amendment 
the government had asserted a critical interest in the security 
of sensitive and classified law enforcement information and in the 
integrity and public image of the department 
yet given the absence of a drug problem at the department it 
is difficult to see how security of sensitive information or the 
integrity and public image of the department would be much served 
by drug testing said the judge 
revercomb noted that employees also might embezzle obstruct 
justice or accept bribes but that no one could seriously argue 
that absent any grounds to suspect misconduct the justice 
department would be justified in tapping the employees telephone 
censoring his mail or searching his house 
something more than unfounded fears must justify an intrusive 
search revercomb said even though a relaxed reasonableness 
standard applies to a search by the government as an employer such 
a search must be for a noninvestigatory and workrelated purpose 
referring to previous cases revercomb noted that 
individualized suspicion is usually a prerequisite to a 
constitutional search or seizure 
under the justice department plan announced late last month the 
agency would have started testing in as soon as 60 days seven 
percent of a group of 1800 employees in positions deemed sensitive 
would be tested annually 
after issuing the preliminary injunction the justice department 
sought and was granted a permanent injunction the government 
will ask the us circuit court of appeals next week for a stay of 
the permanent injunction so that the department can proceed with 
the program said justice department spokeswoman amy brown 
it can be more difficult to obtain a stay of a preliminary 
injunction because the legal question presented in that instance is 
whether a district judge abused his discretion which is quite 
broad the review of a permanent injunction would examine the 
merits of the constitutional arguments in the case a prospect 
favored by the justice department 
assistant attorney general john bolton had argued thursday to 
revercomb that the whole world is watching including leaders 
of the medellin cocaine cartel and panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
stephen sachs the former maryland attorney general who is 
representing 42 justice department employees who filed sued to stop 
the program said the agency clearly does not understand the 
difference between ends and means

vice president george bushs office announced 
friday a new federal program aimed at helping children with serious 
disabilities to receive additional benefits for care in the home 
the idea behind the program to be administered by the department 
of health and human services is to allow such children to be with 
their parents in instances where the family income is too high to 
qualify these adults for home care expenses under the supplemental 
security income program 
such care previously has been available to these children only 
in hospitals and bushs press office said this had the effect of 
discouraging parents from keeping their families at home 
the program was developed by the health care financing 
administration a part of hhs in response to a request that bush 
made last march to a meeting of the presidential task force on 
regulatory relief which he heads 
the problem was brought to the vice presidents attention by the 
family of kaileigh mulligan a 2yearold methuen mass girl born 
with downs syndrome compounded by heart and respiratory problems 
kaileigh who was hospitalized for most of her first year of 
life was able to return home under a medicaid program for 
children which pays for home care when that care costs no more 
than institutional care 
however when kaileigh left the hospital she was notable to 
retain the supplemental security income payment she had been using 
for personal needs such as diapers aspirin and other 
nonprescription drugs the press office said in a statement 
the new program involves states to seek waivers for normal home 
and communitybased care this would permit in kaileighs case 
the massachusetts medicaid program with matching federal funds to 
reimburse families for extra nonprescription drugs and medical 
supplies that children could receive free at the hospital 
not only will this plan help keep families together by 
facilitating home care of disabled children and eliminating an 
incentive to keep them in hospitals but it is anticipated that 
states will be able to reduce the total cost of such care by 
reducing the need for institutionalization bush said in a 
statement

a professor convicted of killing and 
dismembering a teenage prostitute with a chain saw was sentenced 
friday to 25 years to life in prison by a judge who said the 
educator was a dr jekyll and mr hyde 
max bernard franc 58 whose secret life as a homosexual voyeur 
was disclosed during his trial coughed slightly but remained 
impassive as superior court judge john reid imposed the maximum 
sentence 
reid described the murder of tracy leroy nute 18 and the 
dismemberment of his body with a chain saw as hideous cruel and 
callous 
franc was accused of shooting nute a runaway from kansas city 
mo chopping up the body and distributing it across 200 miles of 
california franc said a transient named terry adams committed the 
crime but adams was never found 
dr franc the one thing that becomes very clear to me is you 
are two different people said the judge youre the scholar to 
your colleagues your students talk about you as if you were the 
second coming as a teacher but none of them talk about what was 
going on in the hollywood area of your life 
franc who taught at fresno state university until his arrest 
last august had maintained an apartment in west hollywood some 
200 miles away where he paid young men to pose for nude 
photographs his attorney has said 
an analogy has to be drawn to dr jekyll and mr hyde said 
the judge 
he imposed the sentence after francs sister carol waiters a 
social worker from philadelphia made an impassioned plea for her 
brother describing him as a brilliant bilingual teacher who 
inspired his students 
i ask i beg of you judge reid do not let this mind go to 
waste in prison mrs waiters said in a trembling voice 
he has so much to offer she said to shut him away and 
snuff out his creativity and productivity would be a terrible waste 
to society 
reid said he hoped franc would use the time in prison to help 
uneducated inmates improve themselves 
i hope you do something beneficial with the rest of your 
life he said i think its a shame it had to come to this but 
these are your acts no one elses acts 
franc a native of depere wis was arrested after a chain saw 
he had rented was returned with bits of flesh and blood in it 
even if the only thing you did was watch someone else kill 
terry nute what type of person could go and rent a chain saw 
knowing it would be used to cut up a body the judge asked franc 
theres no question thats exactly what you did 
deputy public defender mark kaiserman lost a bid for a new trial 
and reduction of the firstdegree murder conviction the judge said 
he felt the jurys verdict was proper even if franc had only aided 
and abetted in the murder he conceded that what actually happened 
was never clear and he could not conclude positively that franc 
pulled the trigger to kill nute 
deputy district attorney sterling norris said franc ought to 
feel lucky that he doesnt go to the gas chamber because special 
circumstances were not involved in the case 
he said the pleas for leniency based on francs status as a 
college professor smacks to me of class distinction 
kaiserman said franc will appeal his conviction

and not as chief executive and that the parliamentary system be 
kept intact

presenting the suggested government reforms to parliament 
the president will not be an executive president he will only 
have a custodial role in two areas safeguarding our financial 
reserves and the integrity of our public service

policies or make executive decisions 
the president currently has no special powers but is ceremonial 
head of the state he must assent to any bill passed by parliament 
before it becomes law 
the recommendations drawn up by senior ministers said the 
parliamentary system of government should not be altered the prime 
minister and his cabinet should govern the nation 
on critical issues they would still make the decisions but 
would have to seek the presidents concurrence if the president 
did not go along the government could take the issue to the people 
parliament now elects the president for a fouryear term under 
the changes the people would directly elect the president for a 
sixyear term 
sinnathamby rajaratnam senior minister in the office of 
longtime prime minister lee kuan yew indicated on july 22 that lee 
could be chosen president 
as far as i know they ministers have decided goh should 
become the next prime minister the moment prime minister lee steps 
down rajaratnam was quoted as telling reporters 
lee will be 65 years old in september

like they withheld information

federal thrift institution regulators said 
friday they have extended the deadline for completing a deal with 
the robert m bass group to take over one of the nations largest 
savings and loan associations 
the federal home loan bank board said it expected to wrap up 
negotiations with the fort worth texasbased bass group for 
acquisition of american savings and loan association of stockton 
calif by sept 1 
the bank board had announced on april 21 that it had granted 
exclusive negotiating rights to bass until july 5 but later 
extended that to aug 1 
according to the agencys statement then as now the 
extension was granted because of the substantial progress made in 
the negotiations to that date 
the ailing american savings owned by the irvine califbased 
financial corp of america the second largest thrift holding 
company in the nation has been a candidate for a government rescue 
for nearly a year 
when the deal is finally completed it is likely to set a record 
as the largest rescue of a savings institution 
according to a source familiar with the negotiations the cost 
to the federal savings and loan insurance corp which insures 
deposits in sampls up to 100000 would be roughly 13 billion to 
2 billion 
but the source said little or none of the assistance would be 
in cash most of it would come in the form of promissory notes from 
fslic or in guarantees against the risk of certain kinds of future 
losses 
one of the factors apparently snagging the deal is the bass 
groups concern that the fslic assistance would be subject to 
californias 11 percent corporate income tax 
the california legislature has scheduled a hearing aug 8 on a 
bill that would make it clear the tax does not apply 
these have been complex negotiations and the staff has worked 
out most of the economic terms said m danny wall chairman of 
the bank board however there are other details to work out and 
documents to complete and we as a board need time to carefully 
review the final recommendation from our staff

the cocaine problem and that he allowed himself to be captured 
because he opposes drug trafficking 
eight bolivian journalists were allowed to meet with suarez 
gomez in the san pedro prison in la paz 
he was arrested 10 days ago at his ranch 350 miles east of la 
paz 
i hold the reagan administration totally responsible for the 
great advance of this drug affliction against humanity because it 
had the obligation to delineate an efficient policy to confront the 
problem suarez gomez told the reporters 
they quoted him as sayingwithout taking credit away from the 
police i facilitated my capture precisely because i could not 
continue to carry the guilt of traffickers on my shoulders that is 
why i decided to come and face the situation that awaited me and 
clear up my situation 
he added i am not the king of cocaine but rather the king of 
the fight against cocaine i have always fought to keep the price 
of cocaine high to save my people and humanity from the brutal 
effects of trafficking 
suarez gomez 57 was greeted with shouts of long live the 
king by inmates when he arrived at the la paz prison tuesday

representatives from 14 states along the 
mississippi river disagreed friday on how to restrict hunting to 
ease pressure on a duck population crippled by years of habitat 
destruction 
droughts this year and last added to the problem which wildlife 
services and hunting organizations in the united states and canada 
have battled for years said hugh bateman chief of the game 
division of louisiana 
the mississippi flyway council which represents three canadian 
provinces and a corridor of states stretching to the gulf of 
mexico is meeting to decide on season and bag limit 
recommendations it will present on aug 3 to the us fish and 
wildlife service 
less than a decade ago many states had seasons of 50 days or 
more last year seasons averaged about 40 days in the flyway 
the socalled upper flyway committee of the northern states 
friday decided to go along with federal suggestions for a 30day 
season eding jan 1 and a fourduck bag limit 
the lower flyway committee of the south went along with the 
30day season but wanted to continue the point system on the number 
of ducks taken each duck worth so many points with the point 
limit at 100 a day for example a mallard would be worth 35 points 
the real sticking point is the seasons end 
there is no way i can go for a january 1st date said 
bateman chairman of the lower flyway committee in north 
louisiana in mississippi if you dont get the right weather you 
have no duck hunting until christmas youre talking about a weeks 
season 
his panel agreed proposing an ending date of jan 15 
both committees were to report saturday to the full council for 
a compromise 
federal wildlife experts say the flight population of ducks is 
expected to be 66 million this year the lowest since the record of 
1985 when 62 million were estimated to have moved through the 
flyway 
drought conditions have been a problem in the nesting grounds of 
the canadian prairies for much of the decade according to a 
federal report handed out at the council session 
moreover agriculture activities continue to remove nesting 
and brood breeding habitat from the landscape said the report 
the outlook for a rapid return to better breeding conditions and 
much improved duck population is not good 
upper flyway panel states are minnesota wisconsin michigan 
ohio indiana illinois iowa and missouri 
the southern states in the council are louisiana mississippi 
alabama arkansas tennessee and kentucky

leftist sandinista government friday and president daniel ortega 
praised them at a public ceremony 
these people are representatives of the american people who 
dont want war they want peace ortega said to about 200 people 
who gathered in luis alfonso velazquez park 
wounded nicaraguan soldiers watched the ceremony and children 
mobilized by the sandinista party chanted lets go to war carry 
the bullets 
the veterans peace convoy sponsored by a washingtonbased 
coalition of six activist groups journeyed across mexico and 
central america for two weeks after a dispute with the us customs 
service

vehicles as they plan to do humanitarian aid is allowed under the 
embargo

children he tried also to obstruct this caravan ortega said 
he said they carried goods that threatened the security of the 
united states 
ortega had a child bring him a box of the goods and took out a 
baby bottle look at the weapons they brought he said holding 
it up this is what reagan did not want to arrive 
he screwed the top on the bottle the weapon is ready to 
fire he announced all it needs is milk 
convoy member raul valdez spoke out against us funding for the 
rebels known as contras who have been trying to overthrow 
nicaraguas leftist government for nearly seven years 
this money that is sent to cause death here is being taken 
away from our children he said our taxes shouldnt be used to 
kill nicaraguans its unjust immoral 
the activists were given military tshirts and sandinista army 
hats the ceremony ended with the sandinista anthem which 
proclaims we fight against the yankees enemies of humanity 
a convoy spokesman said the supplies would go to three 
sandinista organizations representing children workers and women 
he also said 18 of the 20 vehicles would be left in nicaragua with 
party organizations including labor unions

closely intertwined in nicaragua

faced fines of up to 50000 each and 10 years in prison if they 
did not bring the vehicles back within 30 days 
a us treasury department official in washington speaking on 
condition of anonymity said friday that no decision had been made 
on whether to file charges against convoy members he said the case 
was under active review by the departments office of foreign 
assets control 
in june us customs officials stopped the original convoy of 
38 vehicles from crossing into mexico about 100 convoy 
participants drove to washington to demonstrate against the 
decision circling around the white house and in front of the state 
department for three days 
eight members of the group were arrested july 9 when they

chinas official news agency saturday blamed 
vietnam for blocking progress at this weeks cambodian peace talks 
in indonesia 
the xinhua news agency said little was accomplished at the 
meeting which ended thursday 
it characterized vietnams stance at the talks as indeed 
disappointing the agency also said the hanoibacked government 
in cambodia had neither new ideas nor sincerity for the 
solution 
the talks brought together for the first time cambodias leaders 
and rebels from a threeparty coalition but they reached no 
agreements on a solution to the nineyear conflict in cambodia the 
sides agreed to set up a working group for further discussions 
vietnam said the talks led to some general progress but the 
strongest guerrilla faction the khmer rouge called that assertion 
a shameless lie cambodian premier hun sen blamed lack of 
progress on the khmer rouge 
in its commentary xinhua said vietnamese foreign minister 
nguyen co thach and hun sen tried to take the initiative by holding 
news conferences and putting forth a sevenpoint peace proposal 
however the news agency charged that their basic stand on 
three key issues did not change at all the commentary said 
vietnam refused to set a definite timetable for rapid withdrawal of 
its troops continued to insist on disarming the khmer rouge and 
ousting it from the resistance coalition and refused to dissolve 
the current phnom penh government 
vietnam has pledged to withdraw its estimated 120000 troops 
from cambodia by 1990 but it also demands assurances the khmer 
rouge will not return to power the khmer rouge ruled from 197578 
and are accused of killing more than a million people in a reign of 
terror while trying to turn cambodia into a primitive agrarian 
society 
china is the main supplier of arms and funds to the khmer rouge 
it also strongly supports the threeparty resistance coalition

an oceanographers study released friday says the medicaltype 
waste washing ashore on northeastern beaches was probably dumped 
near the mouth of new york harbor in midjune 
the waste including syringes vials of blood and what appeared 
to be hospital or clinic equipment began appearing on new yorks 
long island in early july and in rhode island and massachusetts 
later in the month it resulted in periodic beach closings 
in new york city two large beaches reopened to swimmers friday 
after authorities reported that only a small number of syringes and 
other debris had washed ashore but about 30 beaches along a 
10mile stretch from pelham manor to rye on long island sound were 
closed to swimmers because of syringes washing up and a popular 
long island beach was closed because of sewage 
heavy rain in the boston area this week prompted officials to 
close beaches and ban shellfishing in some areas the rain poured 
more than 400 million gallons of dirty storm water into boston 
harbor and neighboring streams 
university of rhode island oceanographer malcolm spaulding said 
the medicaltype waste sightings in northeastern states are 
consistent with a release in the vshaped section of ocean leading 
to new york harbor on june 1116 
rhode island gov edward d diprete said he was sending copies 
of the report to govs mario cuomo of new york and thomas h kean 
of new jersey and urging them to crack down on waste dumping 
it seems clear from this excellent scientific detective work 
that our beaches are being fouled by wastes from other states 
diprete said in a statement accompanying the report 
spaulding said his study was based on meteorological data from 
the national weather service he said he used the wind and current 
data to both track the waste backward from where it was found and 
forward from potential sources 
on friday new york city health department spokesman barry 
adkins said rockaway beach in the borough of queens was reopened 
because the amount of medical waste found including nine syringes 
was not considered significant 
although authorities refer to the problem as medical waste they 
say many of the syringes could have come from individual diabetics 
or drug users the waste has not been linked to any hospital or 
clinic 
long beach a popular long island bathing spot was closed 
friday after sewage debris was seen floating in the water the 
beach along a four mile stretch of western nassau county will 
remain closed until health inspectors can ensure that the water 
quality is safe according to nassau county health department 
spokeswoman shelly domash

a compromise shaped up from private 
discussions at the lambeth conference friday on the issue of 
consecrating the first women bishop in the anglican church 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie head of the anglican 
communion has said that although all anglican churches probably 
would accept women priests a woman bishop could split the 
communion the us episcopal church and new zealand church are 
considering consecrating women bishops 
the 525 bishops representing 70 million anglicans in 164 
countries will debate the issue monday at the lambeth conference 
a compromise resolution drafted friday by john neill bishop of 
tuam in ireland urges the conference to respect differences of 
opinion 
it says the conference recognizes the serious hurt which would 
result from the questioning of the validity of the episcopal acts 
of a woman bishop and likewise the hurt experienced by those whose 
conscience would be offended by the ordination of a woman to the 
episcopate 
the church needs to exercise sensitivity patience and 
pastoral care toward all concerned 
while addressing the issue we have tried to stress the deep 
hurt that will be involved both ways among those who are offended 
by it and by those who do not feel it goes far enough 
archbishop donald robinson of sydney australia introduced a 
resolution saying women should not be consecrated as bishops for 
the avoidance of further impairment of communion both within and 
between the churches 
mondays debate will come at the start of the last week of the 
threeweek conference 
this is the first lambeth conference to be held in 10 years 
each of the 27 anglican churches worldwide is selfgoverning but 
they look to the church of england for guidance and runcie is the 
world anglican leader 
the last lambeth conference in 1978 evaded the issue of women 
priests by saying all the member churches should respect each 
others decisions the question of a woman bishop did not arise at 
that time 
according to conference statistics some 1200 women have been 
admitted to the priesthood by a minority of the anglican churches 
most of them in the united states canada and new zealand 
opponents say the concept of woman priests does not exist in 
bible teaching they also say that bishops are considered the 
successors of christs apostles who were men and if a woman 
bishop is consecrated some churches might leave the communion on 
grounds she could not be in communion with the other bishops

the movie cry freedom 
opened in more than 30 south african theaters friday with the 
censors approval but police said it threatened public safety and 
seized the copies seven hours later 
they cited two bombs anonymous phone threats and violent scenes 
in the movie as evidence that it was dangerous 
moviegoers at the northcliff theater in a rich white 
johannesburg suburb arrived to find posters being taken down and 
police ready to confiscate the film cry freedom was replaced 
by i was a teenage vampire 
richard attenborough who directed the movie said in london 
i never believed they would show it the overall reason for 
making the film was to tell people the truth about apartheid and 
about how it struck both black and white south africans 
nomphelo ndabula 19 emerged from a theater in tears i was 
nearly heartbroken she said the people especially whites 
must see the film they will see that the black man must have 
rights they will see that blacks are people 
in los angeles tom pollock chairman of the mca motion picture 
group said of the police action we at universal pictures 
condemn the actions of the government of south africa however we 
applaud the courage of uip the films overseas distributor and 
local theater owners throughout south africa who agreed to play the 
film despite the controversy and pressure 
glenn gumpel executive director of the directors guild of 
america issued a statement saying we abhor any censorship 
wherever found in the world and are appalled by the actions of the 
south african government attenborough is a guild member 
the publication appeals board ruled friday morning for the 
second time that the film could be shown it said the movie which 
depicts the death in detention in 1977 of young black consciousness 
leader steve biko was biased against police but did not endanger 
race relations or state security 
gen hendrik de witt the police commissioner declared in a 
statement friday evening that the film endangers the safety of 
the public the maintenance of public order and will delay the 
termination of the state of emergency imposed on june 12 1986 
minister of information stoffel van der merwe said the 
government decided to override the board because the censors could 
not judge the situation on the streets 
the security forces are portrayed in such a negative light 
that their public image would be seriously undermined he said 
whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth as 
opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to 
exploitation and repression 
van der merwe said those portrayals were not accurate 
south africas apartheid system establishes a society in which 
the 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs the 5 
million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
residential districtes schools health services and recreation 
areas 
the movie directed by attenborough in neighboring zimbabwe is 
based on two books by donald woods a white newspaper editor who 
befriended biko and fled the country after bikos death 
woods is banned in south africa and it is illegal to quote him 
as actor kevin kline does in portraying him but de witt did not 
mention that point in ordering the copies confiscated under 
emergency regulations 
explosions but no injuries were reported at two theaters 
showing cry freedom the blast at the metro theater in downtown 
durban occurred soon after police evacuated a multiracial crowd of 
300 and the other was at kings cinema in alexandra a black 
township outside johannesburg 
theaters in port elizabeth pretoria durban and in soweto the 
largest black township near johannesburg reported receiving 
anonymous bomb threats 
the censorship board approved the film without restrictions in 
november it was to open in april but distributors withdrew it 
asking for assurances no one would be prosecuted for showing the 
film the government made no promises 
stoffel botha home affairs minister ordered the board this 
week to review its decision the censors held a hearing thursday 
and announced friday morning the movie could be shown with an age 
restriction of 19 
showings began half an hour later 
van der merwe told a news conference the movie was intended as 
an antisouth africa propaganda instrument and we dont need 
that sort of internal disturbance and excitement from people like 
richard attenborough 
police reported threats and violence at one theater but did not 
name it there were no reports of such disturbances from 
journalists who joined audiences around the country 
i dont think people will go out and riot because its about 
events we all know about said a black youth at the kine theater 
in johannesburg he would not give his name 
the audience of 200 most of them black teenagers jumped 
forward in their seats and hissed during the scene at the end in 
which white policemen open fire on marching soweto schoolchildren 
in 1976 
sobs also could be heard people sat with hands in front of 
their mouths the hissing grew when the camera showed patches of 
blood on the childrens crisp white school shirts 
several blacks sang softly along with the soundtrack of god 
bless africa which many blacks consider to be their national 
anthem 
it ends with the shout amandla the zulu word for power 
many viewers joined the shout then the audience filed out without 
waiting for the credits

the canadian government closed a loophole friday 
that allowed south african tennis stars golfers and other athletes 
to compete in canada despite a commonwealth ban on sporting links 
with south africa 
foreign minister joe clark said in the future individuals 
traveling on south african passports and seeking entry into canada 
to participate in a sports event will be denied visas 
the change means that south african tennis players gary muller 
and christo van rensburg scheduled to compete in next weeks 
canadian open tennis tournament in toronto will be denied visas 
the minister told parliament earlier this week that he intended 
to close the loophole in a 1977 agreement that encourages 
commonwealth countries to combat apartheid by discouraging contact 
or competition with athletes from south africa 
ambassador johannes hendrik de klerk of south africa reacted to 
that announcement by saying sports in his country had been fully 
integrated for years 
isolating individual south african sportsmen and women can 
make no positive contribution towards change in south africa de 
klerk said 
opposition members of parliament pointed out that the agreement 
was effective against sports teams from south africa but 
individuals were entering the country on business visas 
clark said his action is fully in keeping with the major role 
the canadian government has played in the international struggle 
against apartheid 
next week the commonwealth committee of foreign ministers on 
southern africa will meet in toronto to review the fight against 
apartheid although no new sanctions are expected clark is 
chairman of the eightmember committee 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which 
south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services

there is light at the bottom of the deep dark 
seas scientists say they have discovered off the washington coast 
a group of scientists headed by university of washington 
oceanographers said they photographed the oceanbottom light at 
hydrothermal vents 180 miles off the washington coast 
the vents openings along the ridges where the plates of the 
earths surface meet spew out 650degree water that has picked up 
minerals in the seabed 
the light confirms a hypothesis that cindy lee van dover 34 a 
graduate student in oceanography in a joint woods hole 
oceanographic institution and massachusetts institute of technology 
program has been working on for two years 
the discovery also ends the longheld scientific belief that 
there is no light at the ocean bottoms said john delaney 46 uw 
professor of oceanography and lead scientist for the dive 
ms van dover after whom the light has been named the van 
dover glow began her research in the summer of 1986 on live 
shrimp that crowded together around atlantic ocean hot springs 
feeding on bacteria the creatures lack normal shrimp eyes 
ms van dover said she noticed large organs beneath their shells 
that had no lenses but otherwise looked like eyes further study 
proved the organs were lightsensitive although they could not 
form images 
if hot springs glow then the shrimp would be able to use the 
organs to lead them to the glow and hence to food ms van 
dover hypothesized 
tuesday during the research submersible alvins final 
2200meter dive which is nearly 14 miles below sea level the 
scientists said they finally proved the hypothesis 
submarine pilot dudley foster held the vessel steady enough 
against strong currents for a camera to take 20second exposures of 
the hot springs 
when processed the images showed light coming from two 
different hot springs the scientists said 
the university announced the findings before the scientists 
could publish them in any journal where they would be subject to 
peer review 
ms van dover said scientists do not yet know what produces the 
light but it could be because the minerals in the water heat up so 
much they glow or it could be due to a chemical reaction 
the light could offer some new possibilities to theories of 
evolution of living creatures ms van dover said 
the thought that there could be photosynthesis using light to 
produce food down there is an entirely new idea she said 
there has been a lot of thought on the origin of life and how 
deepsea life may have played in it 
the alvin is scheduled to make another dive in four weeks and 
delaney said either he or ms van dover will be aboard the two are 
considering experiments for that trip including identifying the 
color of the light its wavelength and measuring how far it 
penetrates through the water delaney said

desillers and several others 
he refused to elaborate on the information saying only that no

associated press resulted in a busy signal fred kerstein who is 
handling the dade county investigation refused to comment 
ronnie born with defective liver ducts first attracted 
national attention after a february 1987 robbery at st anthonys 
roman catholic school in fort lauderdale in which 4000 collected 
by schoolmates was taken 
news of the incident prompted a nationwide outpouring of 
donations for ronnies medical care including a 1000 gift from 
president reagan 
gerwens refused to say whether the fingerprints are related to 
the parochial school robbery 
mrs desillers has refused to pay 262000 in medical bills to 
childrens hospital in pittsburgh saying her son received improper 
care 
a courtappointed caretaker of the donated funds said mrs 
desillers improperly used 200000 of the money on luxury items 
ranging from jewelry to a bmw sports car 
on thursday a dade circuit judge ruled that she is not entitled 
to the remaining 240000 of the donated money and that it should 
instead pay medical bills debts and help other needy ill children

the interamerican court of human 
rights on friday found the honduran government guilty in the 1981 
disappearance of a student in police custody and ordered it to pay 
damages to the mans family 
a government spokesman said honduras will comply with the order 
the first verdict handed down by the court 
the decision in the case of angel manfredo velasquez 35 a 
university student leader came after an eightmonth trial 
the court is an agency of the organization of american states 
based in san jose the capital of neighboring costa rica its seven 
international jurists are handling other cases of central american 
citizens who disappeared while in custody or suffered other human 
rights abuses

have disappeared in honduras during the past eight years and 
another 800 have been slain for political motives

college of economics when police arrested him sept 8 1981 during

folk singer pete seeger and new york city 
activist al sharpton were sentenced to 15 days in jail friday on 
disorderly conduct charges stemming from a racially charged 
demonstration over an alleged rape 
albany police court judge thomas keegan also found 10 others 
guilty of disorderly conduct for disrupting traffic during an april 
4 demonstration near the state capitol in albany the protesters 
claim racism in the investigation of a claim by tawana brawley a 
black wappingers falls teenager that she was abducted and raped 
by six white men last november 
two defendants were acquitted after the threeday nonjury 
trial one of those acquitted rodney stewart had tears running 
down his face as he said he wanted to join the others as they were 
taken directly to jail 
as he was led out of court sharpton a minister who also is the 
subject of state and federal investigations into his financial 
dealings raised his fist and shouted tell cuomo to straighten 
this out 
sharpton and two other brawley advisers new york city lawyers 
alton maddox jr and c vernon mason have accused new york gov 
mario cuomo of racism because he appointed the state attorney 
general rather than a prosecutor of their choosing to look into 
the brawley case 
a handful of demonstrators in court briefly chanted no 
justice no peace following the sentencing 
the defendants who all got 15 days in jail were led away to 
begin serving their sentences immediately at the albany county jail 
maddox who represented all the defendants except seeger called 
the decision a political hit 
its clear the constitution does not apply to al sharpton 
pete seeger and any other people who support the elimination of 
racism and discrimination and particularly those who support tawana 
brawley maddox said 
maddox said after the sentencing he was searching for a judge 
that he could ask to grant bail friday evening pending appeal of 
the demonstrators convictions 
maddox had argued that the defendants were exercising their 
constitutional right to free speech in the demonstration 
assistant albany county district attorney steven dougherty 
focused his case on whether the demonstrators ignored repeated 
warnings by police to disperse when they tried to block traffic he 
said the demonstrators could have gotten off with fines if they had 
not insisted on a trial 
state attorney general robert abrams has said his inquiry will 
probably end without the arrest of any suspects because miss 
brawley and her family will not cooperate on the advice of 
sharpton mason and maddox

higher humidity friday gave firefighters 
the upper hand against a 3000acre forest fire that had destroyed 
15 homes on the western edge of the city but it remained the 
toppriority fire in the nation 
were very confident today said steve gallegos fire 
incident commander he said the fire was 90 percent contained by 
afternoon 
only a wisp of smoke was visible during the afternoon drifting 
with light wind 
if the weather holds were pretty confident that no other 
structures will be lost fire information officer rich homann 
said 
homann said much of friday was spent strengthening fire 
containment lines 
firefighters said they hoped to contain the arson blaze by early 
saturday and control it by sunday that was the first time since 
the fire started tuesday that firefighters had given an estimate of 
when they might get a handle on the blaze in the forested black 
hills 
its looking a lot more positive than it has said fire 
information officer mike ball 
hundreds of people had evacuated their homes from several 
subdivisions in and around the forest and all but 125 people were 
allowed to return home by friday evening 
gene ickler who left his home on wednesday said he didnt know 
what to expect when he returned friday the fire burned to within a 
few feet of his house but it was not damaged 
you feel like doing a cartwheel to see your home standing 
he said the emotions really run 
fire crews in yellowstone national park where about 93000 
acres of forest has burned took the calculated risk friday of 
setting their own fires in dead timber and brush to rob major fires 
of fuel paths to building complexes 
park officials said the south entrance to the park will reopen 
sunday because the danger of fire reaching buildings around the old 
faithful geyser had been significantly reduced 
fires fed by droughtdried fields and forests also blackened 
regions of alaska montana idaho california washington and 
wisconsin but all of utahs fires had been tamed by friday 
officials said 
humidity of 40 percent to 50 percent was expected to slow the 
rapid city fire ball said 
last night firefighters were able to work on that line that 
theyve been trying to complete in the southeast along highway 
44 ball said friday crews working by hand finished burning all 
the fuel between the edge of the fire and the fire line 
flames jumped the highway at one point but only about 20 acres 
burned on the other side before the fire was extinguished said 
mary sue waxler spokeswoman for the us forest service 
the blaze licking into housing developments in hills along the 
western edge of this city of 50000 people was the top priority 
fire in the nation homann said 
that basically means that when resources are requested for 
this fire we will receive first priority he said 
members of volunteer fire departments from around the state 
saved 100 houses thursday with an estimated value of 37 million 
ball said those departments had brought 65 fire trucks to the area 
to pump water onto threatened houses a local businessman and his 
father have started a fund for the firefighters saying they should 
be rewarded for their work 
firefighters are really risking their lives to protect 
structures as well as they can homann said one house had the 
aluminum window sills melted out of it and firemen were still able 
to save the house 
in addition national guard helicopters carried hundreds of 
loads of water to dump on buildings in the path of the fire 
considering that the fire spread over 600 more acres of housing 
areas thursday firefighters did well to lose only eight houses 
that day said waxler 
the fire also had destroyed 40 outbuildings and more than 40 
vehicles 
elsewhere 10 families driven from their cabins in two 
developments in a mountainous area northeast of boise idaho 
because of the 4600acre willis gulch fire were allowed to return 
home friday night 
more crews joined firefighters on the lines friday raising the 
number of firefighters to more than 970 
firefighters in yellowstone revised the number of acres burned 
from 95000 down to about 93000 after aerial infrared mapping in 
the 22 million acre park which is the size of delaware and rhode 
island combined 
on the 10100acre shoshone fire which forced the closure of 
the parks grant village and threatened buildings in the complex 
officials got part way through a planned 300acre burnout designed 
to put a quartermile buffer around the village 
helitorches flame throwers on helicopters were used to set 
burnouts on the northeast flank of the 8800acre north fork fire 
which threatened the large hotel and services complex surrounding 
the old faithful geyser 
were happy with the burnout so far said fire spokesman 
brian fox once we get the northeast head of the fire dealt with 
it can go north away from old faithful

the high heels bunny tails and 
figureshaping costumes that transformed cocktailserving into a 
sexual fantasy will be just a memory saturday when americas last 
playboy club closes 
the playboy club in a lansing hotel was filled to its 250patron 
capacity on friday night for one last party and 60 people ended up 
standing outside 
i want to grab a cottontail said 42yearold bill mcdonald 
this is the first and last time ill be here so its worth a 
wait said lynda nagle who had never been to the lansing club 
but had fond memories of visits to the playboy club in detroit more 
than a dozen years ago 
the food was great the atmosphere was great it was a place 
to go to meet executivetype husband material she said 
inside milos tavorsky a quiet man of around 60 sat alone 
at the end of the bar watching the camera crews and shaking his 
head 
tavorsky said hed been a threetimesaweek patron for the past 
four years and couldnt remember a time when it was as crowded 
a week ago there werent 20 people hre he said this is 
something 
outside in a hallway bunny michelle even on the last night 
they obeyed the rules about revealing their last names was taking 
a snapshot of the waiting crowd while bunny rochelle posed for with 
a beaming man who tipped her 10 and whispered his hotel room 
number 
rochelle just rolled her eyes 
we get a lot of this she said 
rochelle a bunny for two years said the last week had been 
tough on americas last nine bunnies though tips were good 
theres few girls so its been difficult to take care of the 
quantity of people she said 
on saturday the playboy trappings oversized posters of 
magazine covers and other memorabilia were to be auctioned for 
charity 
the customfit bunny costumes however will not be on the 
auction block said playboy spokeswoman terri tomcsin in chicago 
those go back to playboy enterprises she said 
hugh hefner opened the first playboy club in chicago in 1960 and 
the clubs had their heyday in the 1970s when there were 22 around 
the world 
the companyowned clubs were closed in 1986 and the three 
remaining franchise contracts with hotels in des moines iowa 
omaha neb and lansing were not renewed this year tomcsin said 
thriving clubs remain in japan and the philippines and tomcsin 
said the company plans more overseas operations 
tomcsin said she has been surprised by the media attention the 
lansing closing received 
we just had a big deal with the last of the companyowned 
clubs she said that was different we had been around for 26 
years we were very established the lansing club opened in 82 
you cant really compare 
tomscin said the media attention shows the playboy philosophy 
had an impact on america we were more than just a fad she 
said we had become an important part of american culture 
writer gloria steinem who once took a job as a bunny to write 
an expose offered a different perspective 
i think that playboy clubs were based on sexual repression of 
men and economic kind of oppression of women and im glad to say 
both things are ending steinem said in an interview with abc 
news 
officials at the lansing hilton said the closing announcement 
boosted business at the club which scrapped the key cards and let 
in the general public in 1987 
business has increased four or five times said hilton 
general manager rick barrett i think a lot of people realize 
its the end of a bit of americana

ashdown defeated alan beith by 41401 votes to 16202 in a 72 
percent turnout by the party membership after a lackluster 
campaign both men formerly belonged to the liberal party 
ashdown said after his election that the new party had three 
years until to the next election to supplant the opposition 
labor party as the only prospect of providing a viable alternative 
to prime minister margaret thatchers conservatives 
i dont underestimate the scale of the task ashdown said in 
a television interview but if i didnt believe we could do that 
i wouldnt be doing this job 
the liberals precipitated the merger after their electoral 
alliance with the social democratic party failed at the last 
election in june 1987 to break the power grip of the conservatives 
and labor 
social democratic leader david owen a former foreign secretary 
refused to merge and has maintained a breakaway faction as a 
separate party thus splitting the already minority centrist vote 
liberal party leader david steel who did not run for the 
leadership of the new party blamed the alliances disappointing 
showing in 1987 partly on having two leaders 
the alliance took 225 percent of the vote down from onefourth 
at the previous general election in 1983 
the centrists ratings in the latest poll by harris last week 
were down to 7 percent for the social and liberal democratic party 
and 3 percent for owens faction 
ashdown who represents yeovil in southwest england served in 
the royal navys elite undercover special boat service in the far 
east and later as a royal marine captain in the middle east and 
northern ireland before turning diplomat

nickelodeons nick at nite service knows 
its audience is the tv generation so it will expand its lineup 
this fall to include more old comedies and a new but oldstyle 
cartoon series from animator ralph bakshi 
the patty duke show comes to the cable channels nighttime 
lineup of nostalgia which already includes such classics as mr 
ed my three sons the donna reed show and make room 
for daddy 
nickelodeon is also adding two more contemporary comedy 
showcases beginning sept 12 viewers can see the best of 
saturday night live and sctv backtoback nightly 1011 
pm edt 
nick at nite is targeting the new american family our 
demographics tell us that both kids and their parents are watching 
were not sure who is dragging whom to the set the mom who loves 
donna and remembers it or the kid who just discovered mr ed 
nickelodeon vice president linda kahn told a meeting of 
television critics 
weve decided weve become a museum of broadcasting with a 
beer and a fridge thrown in for good measure she said 
bakshi who also appeared at the presentation to tv critics 
said his halfhour cartoon tattertown would be an homage to the 
oldstyle animation of the 1920s and 30s 
the series is set in a village inhabited by cartoon characters 
well have characters sitting in bars or in parks wondering 
why didnt they make it they could have been as big as mickey but 
they didnt have an organization behind them bakshi said the 
concept sounds something like the wildly successful featurelength 
animated film who framed roger rabbit which is set in toon 
town 
bakshi said he created the concept for tattertown back in 
high school but added if it does sound like it roger 
rabbit thats fine for tattertown bakshi said he will 
create new characters where roger rabbit featured cameos by 
already famous cartoon characters 
bakshi didnt escape questions about his network cartoon show 
mighty mouse and the charge by conservative media critic rev 
donald wildmon that mighty mouse snorted cocaine in one episode 
bakshi said the mouse was sniffing flower petals but later cut 
those seconds from the episode to quiet the controversy 
when an adult makes a statement enough times the kids are 
going to believe it and i didnt want it to become an issues at 
school did he or didnt he said bakshi adding he has a 
10yearold son he said if it had been an adult cartoon he would 
have resisted any changes but in this case my first concern was 
with the kids 
nick at nite will also have its own satirical news show 
global village which boasts a similarly satirical promo a 
takeoff on the currently popular upclose cinema verite 
commercials the global village motto is if we dont cover 
it it doesnt matter 
as far daytime nickelodeon which features kids programming 
the cable channel plans to add the new show kids court in 
which kids decide such issues as whether to turn in a friend for 
cheating on a test and who should have to fix a broken portable 
stereo 
theres also eurekas castle a show aimed at preschoolers 
problems such as being afraid of the dark or having to make a 
telephone call kids will also get to vote in a nickelodeon poll on 
who should be president after a series of reports on the campaign 
by a kid reporter nickelodeon announced it is developing a kids 
news show but it will probably be a few years before it gets on 
the air 
mtv networks which owns nickelodeon also announced some 
changes for its music video channel vh1 that channel aimed at 
older viewers is going this fall to a halfhour format rather than 
radiolike continuous music each half hour viewers will get an 
entertainment news update a video a comedy short another video 
then a time capsule look back at a moment in history before the 
half hour concludes with more videos

madison avenues forecasters say the writers 
strike is unlikely to have much effect on television network 
standings in the fall 
executives of two major new york advertising agencies predict 
that nbc will keep a tight grip on first place in the nielsen 
ratings 
betsy frank of saatchi amp saatchi dfs compton new yorks largest 
agency said abc and cbs would be neckandneck for second place 
its unlikely the standings will change from our original 
forecasts even given the fact there will be cutandpaste 
schedules in the fall she said by telephone from new york the 
pattern of network viewing is pretty hard to shake 
joel m segal executive vice president and director of national 
broadcast for mccannerickson also sees tough competition for 
second place nbc will remain the no 1 network he said if 
anything abc may have a leg up because of the promotion time 
available in war and remembrance to promote its new schedule i 
think cbs will postpone its new shows until after war and 
remembrance in november 
abc plans to telecast the first 18 hours of herman wouks war 
and remembrance miniseries in seven parts over 11 days in 
midnovember it advanced the showing because of a program shortage 
caused by the writers strike 
both agencies published reports on the fall season as originally 
planned by the networks although segal was more optimistic about 
the end of the strike both executives looked for a return to work 
that would enable the networks to get their new shows on by late 
november or early december 
i cant make any predictions about individual shows until the 
strikes over segal said in a telephone interview all bets 
are off until then 
segal had forecast in the mccannerickson report that despite 
vigorous competition from cable videocassettes fox broadcasting 
and ted turners tnt the networks would lose only a small share of 
their audience he said the audience would drop to about 71 percent 
this year from 72 percent in 1987 
its impossible to make any forecast at this time he said 
but i would say war and remembrance and the olympics and world 
series on nbc will tend to increase viewing but repeats of old 
shows and series that were never meant to be on the air like nbcs 
the hardy boys would tend to reduce viewing 
frank said that the clients of her agency had already made their 
network advertising purchases based on the original fall schedules 
she said the delay in starting the fall schedule could alter the 
performances of individual programs forecast in her report 
the saatchi amp saatchi dfs compton report sees abcs roseanne 
and nbcs empty nest and dear john as the three hottest new 
shows of the fall it also forecast a very good chance for cbs 
murphy brown and almost grown and nbcs unsolved 
mysteries and tattingers 
it offered little hope for such long shots as abcs knight 
watch and cbs dirty dancing and close to home 
mccannerickson predicted smash hits for abcs roseanne 
and nbcs empty nest and dear john it gave passing 
grades to cbs murphy brown and nbcs unsolved 
mysteries baby boom and tattingers 
roseanne from the same people who make the cosby show 
stars comedienne roseanne barr as a blue collar woman juggling her 
husband kids home and a job empty nest a spinoff of the 
golden girls stars richard mulligan as a widower with three 
grown children who has now become an eligible bachelor it also 
stars david leisure kristy mcnichol and dinah manoff judd hirsch 
stars in dear john as a newly divorced man who joins a singles 
support group 
mccannerickson said abcs knight watch and murphys 
law cbss almost grown tv 101 paradise dirty 
dancing close to home and the new comedies starting dick van

for many retired americans the temptations are 
growing stronger to venture back into the labor force 
the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 14 years and 
new young workers are scarce because of the low birth rates that 
prevailed in this country in the 1960s and early 1970s 
students of population trends say the situation will almost 
certainly grow more acute over the next few years 
retail stores restaurant chains supermarkets and many other 
types of businesses are looking to the retired as one source of 
help for their laborshortage problem 
whats more even in an era where reported inflation is 
relatively low many retirees may find that they want or need some 
extra income 
the match seems perfect however says a leading advisory firm 
on business and financial affairs retirees are well advised to do 
some reckoning before they go out in quest of a new paycheck 
social security beneficiaries who want to rejoin the work 
force should calculate carefully before making the move says 
united amp babson investment report published in boston 
as the firm points out social security recipients under age 70 
who earn money from a job lose 1 in benefits for every 2 of wages 
they receive above specified limits 
at the same time they must pay income taxes and social security 
taxes on their earnings from the job 
a working beneficiary could conceivably lose 65 percent or 
more of his or her added income united amp babson says 
of course the decision to work or not to work in a persons 
later years may be influenced by emotional factors as well as 
financial ones 
when a leading graduate business school asked recently at what 
age the members of a reunion class would like to retire a very 
large percentage of those who filled out the questionnaire checked 
never 
still it is a sensible idea to figure out beforehand whether 
taking a job in your retirement years is going to make you enough 
takehome money to justify the effort 
this year social security recipients between ages 65 and 70 
begin to lose benefits after their wage and salary earnings exceed 
8400 for those under 65 the cutoff point is 6120 
if a retiree goes back to work at a salary significantly above 
the limit he should request that benefits be suspended united amp 
babsons analysts advise 
that goes especially for workers 65 to 70 years old they add 
since passing up current benefits will increase the social security 
payments they are eligible to receive later on 
all this raises the question of whether the limits on 
recipients earnings serve a useful purpose 
says united amp babson in the 1930s when the social security 
system originated the earnings test limit was included as a way 
of encouraging older workers to leave the work force to free jobs 
for younger people 
in recent years the age distribution of the population has 
shifted dramatically today fewer young workers are entering the 
work force and labor shortages are a problem in many cities 
although 20 or so bills seeking the elimination of earnings 
limits have been filed in congress this legislation is not 
considered a highpriority item

the drought of 88 is a test of nerve and 
confidence for farmers across the american heartland this report 
third in an occasional series on the chases of barry county mich 
examines the emotional strain on one family determined to keep 
their dream alive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
from kurt and dena chases back porch 
fields of corn stretch away toward the horizon a healthylooking 
green but the stalks have no ears the rains came too late in 
barry county 
day by day as they endure the worst drought of their lifetime 
the young farm couple try not to dwell on their worries especially 
in front of their two small children 
but 4yearold jesse knows something is wrong 
theres not a prayer jesse says that he doesnt ask for 
rain dena says sadly but with a mothers proud smile he 
says if theres anything up there jesus let it pour 
and some rain has come 
when a pair of storms roared through in midjuly and dumped 2 
inches of rain more than farmers here had seen in several months 
the cornstalks shot up a foot in four days 
the rain boosted morale but the chases know it did not arrive 
soon enough for most of the 350 acres of corn they farm with kurts 
parents gordon and jean chase had the skies opened up two weeks 
earlier it might have done some good 
the two generations of chases who live less than a mile apart 
off a gravel road will see underdeveloped ears on most plants and 
none at all on others some stalks never made it out of the ground 
the soybeans and hay now have a chance at survival but only if 
the rain continues the helplessness the family feels has taken its 
toll 
ive never really thought about doing anything else but 
farming says kurt 28 as he relaxes on the livingroom couch 
jesse and 2yearold abby wrestling at his feet 
but a year like this one kind of makes you wonder 
kurt has been helping his father on the farm ever since he can 
remember now he is a partner 
his 30yearold sister kim lives with her husband and two 
young children and his 26yearold brother kyle works for an 
insurance company they both live within an hours drive of the 
farm and come over often to help out 
for me it just felt right to stay in farming kurt says 
but he has felt the temptation to trade in 90hour weeks of 
endless chores for a 40hour week at a factory and more time with 
his family its a temptation he resists 
some days he doesnt get to see his daughter at all shes 
sleeping when he leaves at 430 am to milk the cows and shes 
been tucked in for the night by the time he gets home at 930 pm 
sometimes kurt must babysit the irrigation system through the 
night to make sure nothing goes wrong and no water is wasted 
i probably spend more time with my father than with dena 
says kurt who has his fathers thick blond hair fair skin and 
football players physique 
he and dena a pretty brunette met in high school and were 
married eight years ago they are expecting their third child in 
january 
their 115yearold fivebedroom farmhouse needs paint and the 
rickety stairs out back need fixing but inside bunches of dried 
flowers hang from the ceiling and art and ornaments grace the 
walls the same attention to detail can be seen in gordon and

kurt and dena find time together when they can 
dena 27 sometimes packs lunches and takes the children out to 
where kurt is working in the fields and they share a picnic 
during spring planting the children spent long hours with their 
parents in the cab of a tractor 
neither kurt nor his father can find the words to explain fully 
the sense of pride they feel in owning and cultivating land but 
the pride seems to more than make up for the stress that even in 
good times accompanies it 
kurt beams as he watches jesse play with a miniature john deere 
tractor in his sandbox 
he does everything his dad does dena says 
the farming operation is based at jean and gordons home as 
cows graze outside a computer terminal inside shows the changing 
prices corn soybeans and other commodities on the chicago board of

theres a lot of stress involved when your business is based 
at home jean says it seems salesmen always pull in when 
youre halfway through your meal thats probably why vacations 
are so important to us 
its also probably why gordon and jean plan to build a home 
nearby but not on this road when theyre ready to retire 
thats when kurt and dena will move into their house 
gordon and jean believe their son and daughterinlaw will build 
a better but not necessarily bigger farm when they take over 
we see something different in their generation they have 
different priorities jean says maybe seeing our parents come 
through the depression we thought bigger was better but they 
dont maybe after witnessing all the hard times weve had 
this year will surely stick in their memories 
the droughts final impact will not be known until the harvest 
is finished in late fall much still depends on whether the rain 
continues 
all we can do says jean is wait and hope

finding a reliable auto mechanic a big 
problem for many people while at home can be even more taxing 
while traveling 
while honest service stations can be found the american 
automobile association warns that there are some unscrupulous shops 
that overcharge for repairs and recommend unnecessary work 
especially when dealing with motorists from another state warns 
the american automobile association 
officials of the government employees insurance co urge having 
the car checked out by a local mechanic before embarking on a 
vacation or other trip just to head off any developing problems 
in particular have the mechanic check the cooling system 
brakes fan and power belts and tires since these are the most 
common items that break down 
make sure the spare tire is fully inflated too and have the 
mechanic check for proper wheel alignment and balance 
both geico and aaa remind motorists to stay with their cars 
while stopping at unfamiliar service stations if someone needs to 
use the bathroom or walk the dog take turns they advise 
check your water and oil levels each morning before starting 
out as well as the tire pressure 
properly inflated tires can prevent accidents increase tread 
life and stretch out gas mileage reports the tire industry safety 
council 
the aaa advises motorists to be suspicious of any attendant who 
seems to go out of his way to inspect the car while pumping gas 
geico warns that occasionally an attendant will create a problem 
by cutting a fan belt or splashing some oil on the shock absorbers 
to make it appear there is a leak 
to avoid problems 
if the car does break down get a written estimate explaining 
exactly what is to be done before any work starts and get a signed 
receipt for the work 
if the car is not disabled consider getting a second opinion on 
the problem and the cost of repairs 
make certain any old parts are actually replaced not merely 
cleaned and put back in the car ask for the removed items take 
them home with you and have a mechanic inspect them to see if they 
really needed to be replaced 
if a repair shop refuses to provide a written estimate or to 
return replaced parts have the work done somewhere else even if 
the car has to be towed aaa says 
check with a local aaa office for recommendations local better 
business bureaus and consumer affairs offices can help with 
warnings about shops that have generated many complaints

david strode is so singleminded about his 
religious beliefs that he welcomes ridicule and willingly risks 
physical abuse to preach the gospel where and whenever he sees the 
need whether its in the parking lot of a fastfood restaurant or 
on a crowded city street 
he even has a minisermon on his telephone answering machine 
the bible says repent ye therefore and be converted that 
your sins be blotted out begins the taped message to those who 
phone his rented home in this western north carolina mountain town 
strode 40 is a darkhaired powerfully built man a skilled 
machinist and a nonstop talker 
for the past three months he has been mostly talking about the 
controversy which erupted last spring when his sons began preaching 
on their elementary school playground calling their teachers and 
classmates whoremongers and fornicators among other things 
strode says he sees his actions and those of his children as 
the living testimony and witness of totally saved christians 
others in the community see the strodes as the most frustrating 
and infuriating people theyve ever encountered 
they describe the father as a knowitall zealot who likes to 
spout scripture and loves the attention his actions and those of 
his children bring to the family 
the media has made a big deal out of the strodes and it has 
gone to their heads asserts doug moyers an area resident 
lisa mahan ruefully recalls the day last spring at eastfield 
elementary school when she attempted to present strode with a 
parents petition it asked strode to restrain his sons duffy 11 
and matthew 5 who were attracting hordes of reporters with their 
preaching and screeching on the school grounds 
he simply wouldnt listen said mrs mahan who has a child 
at the school we only wanted him to control his children and 
have them quit disrupting the school but he just laughed and 
called me a jezebel and a lot worse 
she paused then added ill tell you one thing nobody wants 
anything to do with him anymore or those kids either 
mike jones managing editor of the mcdowell news marions daily 
newspaper says the strodes have upset practically everyone in the 
community 
its not the fact that the strodes preach that upsets 
people he added its where they do it and how they do it and 
what they call people for example the teachers really got upset 
after the boys started calling them whores and fornicators as you 
might imagine 
the strodes appear to have little or no support even among 
fundamentalist christians locally he said 
strode himself who swears by the king james version of the 
bible and calls everything else trash readily acknowledges 
that he has become a pariah among marions 3000 residents 
a guy came at me with a crowbar the other night while me and 
another preacher was preaching from the back of a pickup truck down 
at the pizza hut parking lot he said theyre trying to run us 
out of town 
i was laid off from my job in may the bosses at the plant 
deny it but i know it was because of my preaching now nobody 
will give me a job even though i have 20 years of experience and 
theres a need for machinists in this area 
he also says the rev danny castle pastor of marions new manna 
baptist church where his family has attended for the past 18 
months recently asked him not to come back 
he said we were hurting the church strode said can you 
believe that here i am living a good christian life and preaching 
the gospel and they ask me and my kids not to come back 
castle has said publicly that his congregation is taking flak 
because of the strodes actions bruce ward the assistant pastor 
said strode repeatedly refused requests to tone down his preaching 
style especially his tendency to call passersby names 
david strode is a very tough case ward said its a real 
shame about those kids but i feel the church not only went the 
extra mile with strode but three extra miles its just that he 
seems to think differently from most other people 
strode who has been on several television and radio talk shows 
in recent weeks says he is beginning to believe marion is a 
bad community 
the world is a wicked place he said as he sat in his living 
room its plain to see the same thing happened to us up in 
pennsylvania before we came down here 
robin strode his 27yearold wife and mother of duffy matthew 
and daughter pepper says she fully supports the preachings of her 
husband and sons 
she also says her husband and sons who literally scream when 
they preach are loving and softspoken at home 
its just that they have to change sort of fill themselves 
with anger when theyre preaching she said its like they 
have to hate the world to be able to see the wickedness thats 
everywhere around us 
mrs strode says her children get their religious convictions 
and preaching style from their father who was saved eight 
years ago while watching television back home in st thomas pa a 
hamlet near chambersburg 
recalling the incident she said it was late one night and he 
was turning the dial looking for something to watch he found what 
he thought was a horror show but it turned out to be the rev jack 
vanimpe an evangelist from royal oak mich whos known as the 
living bible because he can recite the entire new testament 
after hearing vanimpe my husband got a bible and began 
reading it day and night in about two weeks he was totally saved

mrs strode who said she met her husband in a chambersburg 
barroom when she was 15 and married him a year later acknowledges 
she resisted the lord for years after her husband and children were 
converted 
i even left one time for 18 months because i couldnt take 
the constant preaching anymore she said 
during that time i lived like a whore with seven or eight 
different men i was trying to see what the world had to offer but 
i realized it didnt have anything for me and i came back to my 
family a few months after that i was saved 
the family moved from pennsylvania to north carolina in january 
1987 
everything we had was piled up on top of a flatbed truck 
she said we looked like ol jed clampett of the beverly 
hillbillies when we hit town 
strode and his wife are natives of the chambersburg area just 
north of the maryland line 
robin quit school in the 12th grade because she was pregnant 
with our second child but im a high school graduate he said 
he said he went to high school in gettysburg living in a 
childrens home after his mothers death when he was 14 he spent 
two years in the army in west germany and served a fouryear 
machinists apprenticeship he said 
i used to be a drunken fornicator but i always worked and 
made good money 
strode says he came to marion after hearing a taped sermon by 
danny castle 
things werent going so good in pennsylvania for us and i 
really liked danny castles preaching he said but now im not 
so sure that hes really truly saved 
in pennsylvania strode was twice arrested while preaching 
charged with disturbing the peace and he in turn accused 
chambersburg officials in a suit of violating his first amendment 
rights the charges and the suit were eventually dropped with the 
city agreeing to pay his lawyers fees 
will there be more trouble when public school starts up again 
on aug 22 
we may send the kids to school or we may try and teach them at 
home if we can get together the money for the books and so 
forth he said 
asked what their response will be should the strode children 
resume their preaching on school grounds this fall mcdowell county 
school officials would say only that they intend to enforce school 
regulations to the letter 
those rules say children must go directly into the school when 
they arrive the strode boys refused to go inside immediately 
instead preaching outside until the bell rang 
frankly im afraid they might suspend my kids like they did 
last spring and then try to take them away from me strode says 
i love my kids and thats something i could never allow to happen 
who knows were in the process of building a house maybe 
well just sell it and move away somebody probably would buy it in 
a minute just to get rid of us 
if the strodes do leave marion the mayor of chambersburg 
robert morris he hopes they dont return to his community 
strodes a terribly disrupitve influence morris said in a 
telephone interview he used to go up and down our main street 
screaming at the top of his voice calling people whores and 
whoremongers and so forth 
its much quieter here since the strodes left the area and 
frankly we hope they never return

revco ds incs inability to pay the 
huge debt incurred in its 1986 leveraged buyout has forced the 
giant drugstore chain into federal bankruptcy protection and 
illustrated the potential risks to companies and investors involved 
in such transactions 
revco ds inc which operates 2000 us drugstores in the 
midwest southeast and southwest filed for protection from 
creditors thursday just over a month after failing to make a 46 
million interest payment to holders of bonds issued to finance the 
15 billion buyout the largest ever to fail 
boake a sells chairman and chief executive officer told a 
news conference that holders of 400 million in junk bonds 
accelerated the payment schedule after revco missed the interest 
payment june 15 
junk bonds are highyield highrisk notes commonly issued to 
fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers 
in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with 
borrowed funds that are repaid with the companys cash flow or sale 
of its assets 
revcos buyout foundered as increased competition and sluggish 
cash flow crippled the companys ability to cover its obligations 
against a tide of new discount operations and supermarkets 
adding pharmacies revco tried to slash prices and move beyond 
drugs to bigticket items like small appliances lately as those 
efforts faltered it refocused on its core drugstore business 
revco which has annual sales of 23 billion fills more than 
65 million prescriptions a year 
revcos leveraged buyout didnt work out and hundreds more 
have sells said junk bonds have been the best investment on 
wall streetbut if youd only invested in one junk bond youd be 
pretty unhappy if it was revco 
ds partners of new york owns controlling interest in revco 
sells said when the drugstore chain missed its june 15 interest 
payment bondholders established a steering committee that 
contacted the company 
proposed talks over having revco turn over stock to satisfy the 
debt broke down before they even started sells said 
revco has been husbanding cash the past few days to meet its 
payroll and to pay venders who sell to the company after thursdays 
chapter 11 filing in us bankruptcy court in akron 
revcos two largest venders reacted well to news of the 
bankruptcy filing sells said he said the reorganization might 
disrupt shipments from a vender or two but he does not expect much 
change in daytoday operations 
the company does not play to lay off any of its 28000 employees 
because of chapter 11 and has received court permission to continue 
payments of salary and benefits sells said 
the chapter 11 filing includes revco its parent company anac 
holding co and most of its subsidiary operations instacare 
pharmacy services is not included the company said 
the filing allows revco to obtain new credit and invoices for 
goods and services and requires the company to submit to 
bankruptcy court a reorganization plan restructuring the companys 
debt

a partnership bidding 246 billion to acquire 
interco inc may have to raise its offer to satisfy shareholders 
some industry analysts say 
interco said thursday that its board would meet aug 8 to 
consider the 64 a share bid made by city capital associates a 
washington dcbased limited partnership 
wall street indicated it believed bids for the apparel and home 
furnishings manufacturing and retailing company interco stock 
soared 1337 a share to close at 6775 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading thursday 
intercos best known brand names include london fog clothes 
florsheim and converse shoes and broyhill and ethan allen furniture 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission city 
capital said it already owned 87 percent or 314 million of 
intercos 384 million outstanding shares 
city capital listed its principals as steven m rales and 
mitchell p rales they are respectively the chairman and president 
of danaher corp a washingtonbased manufacturer of automotive and 
industrial products and vinyl building materials 
ned armstrong a securities analyst in the washington dc 
office of johnston lemon expressed confidence in the raleses 
ability to attract financial backing for what looks to be a 
highlyleveraged bid for interco 
city capital said it did not have financing commitments for the 
proposed buyout but said it was confident of being able to arrange 
them 
the partnership said that if it succeeded in acquiring interco 
it planned to sell the apparel business and was considering the 
sale of parts of its general retail merchandising and footwear 
manufacturing and retailing businesses 
but city capital left open the possibility that it might reach 
a different conclusion as to which of intercos assets might be 
retained or sold after a review of the companys assets 
operations and policies 
in a letter to the interco board city capital also said it 
might increase its offer based on a further review of information 
about the target company 
robert f buchanan a retail industry analyst with the 
investment firm ag edwards amp sons inc in st louis said he 
believed interco was worth more than the city capital offer 
i think a fair value is somewhere around 67 he said 
buchanan who said intercos footwear and furniture segments 
were its most valuable divisions said the company likely would 
want to remain independent 
laurence c day an analyst with newhard cook and co inc 
agreed saying he would be surprised if interco was receptive to 
the offer even if city capital offered to keep interco management 
intact 
day said recent actions by interco were defensive moves designed 
to boost the price of its stock and make a takeover attempt more 
expensive 
the company announced earlier this month it was considering 
selling its apparel manufacturing group as part of a restructuring 
that began in 1985 
i think its a real question whether interco is interested 
day said i would doubt it 
in addition to its manufacturing operations interco operates 
201 retail locations in 15 states including homeimprovement 
centers general merchandise discount stores mens specialty 
apparel shops and specialty department stores 
interco had sales of 334 billion last year with the apparel 
group contributing about 24 percent 
buchanan said intercos performance hasnt done as well as it 
could in recent years and its stock price had languished

sell them ahead of the weekend as well they said

and daiichi kangyo banks 
also among gainers were heavy industrials such as 
ishikawajimaharima mitsubishi heavy industries and mitsui 
engineering and shipbuilding 
electricals fell back after early gains as some investors took 
profits 
it has been an established pattern that if market opens 
higher it declines because of profittaking said a broker at a 
major securities firm who would not be quoted by name but the 
environment is good and the dollar seems stable for some time 
foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollars strength to 
reduced concern about growing inflation in the united states in 
new york overnight the us currency rose 105 yen to close at 
13260 yen

that are not would be equally eligible for the payments which 
would equal 65 percent of their losses over the 35 percent 
threshold 
under the house version farmers also would be eligible if the 
damage were caused by hail floods or other natural disasters 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
growers whose crops were severely damaged would be eligible for 
supplemental payments under the house bill this would amount to 
an additional 30 percent of losses over 75 percent of expected 
harvest the senate version would cover an additional 20 percent of 
losses over 75 percent

lawmakers are promising to iron out house and 
senate differences over a 6 billion droughtrelief package in a 
quick flurry of action next week and speed the measure on to 
president reagans desk 
my opinion is that the president would accept this bill as it 
is passed today although there have been some things he objects 
to sen richard g lugar rind said thursday after 940 
senate passage of the bill 
the house had approved its version 36829 a few hours earlier 
after scaling back a plan to increase milk price supports a 
proposal widely criticized as excessively favoring the dairy 
industry 
the revised version would impose a temporary increase for three 
months next year milk price supports previously had been scheduled 
to decrease on jan 1 
senators tightened up a similarly controversial benefit in their 
bill that would allow companies that make ethanol for fuel to buy 
corn from government surplus bins at what could shape up as a 
substantial discount 
however there were still warnings that congress was flirting 
with budget trouble by inserting special benefits for constituents 
back home into the measure 
the house urged by agriculture committee chairman e kika 
de la garza dtexas acted to cap the price tag of its bill at 
58 billion 
the senate had no comparably firm figure sen phil gramm 
rtexas said latest estimates put the cost of the senate measure 
at between 585 billion and 655 billion 
gramm warned that running over a 58 billion ceiling calculated 
under the grammrudman budget law would set off nasty fiscal and 
political repercussions 
at the heart of the bill are provisions that would provide 
disaster payments to farmers equal to 65 percent of losses beyond 
35 percent of expected harvest many dairy and livestock producers 
would become eligible for benefits under an expanded government 
feed aid program 
farmers especially hard hit by the drought would get 
supplemental payments under both house and senate bills 
a number of other points remain to be resolved when lawmakers 
meet in a housesenate conference committee next week the house 
version requires farmers to buy federal crop insurance for each of 
the next two years if they are to be eligible for disaster payments 
this year 
the senate version does not contain such a provision which is 
opposed by both the reagan administration and a wide array of major 
crop producer groups 
both bills would cancel a 50cent cut in the milk pricesupport 
level scheduled for jan 1 but the house version would go beyond 
that the house provision would raise the pricesupport level from 
april through june 1989 by 50 cents to 1110 cents for each 100 
pounds of milk 
dairystate lawmakers wanted even more pushing for a permanent 
increase 
this is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent rep pat 
roberts rkan said in opposing the measure he said it was 
unfair to provide such aid to dairymen and not also to cattle 
sheep and poultry producers who must pay the same increased feed

sen tom daschle dsd sponsored the measure but offered a

the amount of corn that could be used at 16 million bushels 
by daschles calcuation the price break for ethanol makers would 
be about 10 cents a bushel although that includes transportation 
costs and other factors he said the measure is aimed at helping 
small ethanol producers but it also would be a boon to the archer

the reagan administration says the federal 
deficit will be 56 billion higher than it predicted back in 
february with the governments red ink now estimated to total 
1523 billion this fiscal year 
while the new administration estimate announced thursday is 
higher it is still below the more gloomy projections earlier this 
year by many private economists who were forecasting a deficit of 
160 billion or worse 
those economists have been busy revising their own figures and 
some now say the administrations new deficit forecast for the 
fiscal year ending sept 30 may actually be too pessimistic 
as the year began the administration predicted the overall 
economy as measured by the gross national product would expand at a 
sluggish 24 percent rate the new budget has boosted that gnp 
estimate to 3 percent 
the higher growth this year has helped push the unemployment 
rate down to a 14yearlow of 53 percent more people working 
means more tax revenues for uncle sam 
tax revenues are expected to be 42 billion higher than the 
administrations february projection according to the new report 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said he is 
now predicting the 1988 deficit will total 145 billion based on 
the gains in tax revenues which have already occurred 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said he is 
forecasting a deficit this year of 151 billion slightly lower 
than the administrations estimate 
the administration is calling for the deficit in the next fiscal 
year to decline to 1401 billion an estimate that private 
economists say is generally in line with their own forecasts 
that deficit estimate is 59 billion below the 146 billion 
level which would trigger automatic spending cuts as required by 
the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
however white house budget director james miller warned that 
the 59 billion cushion did not leave much room for error 
especially given a lengthy list of spending measures congress is 
considering in an election year 
the measure with the highest price tag is a droughtrelief 
package for farmers which miller estimated would cost the 
government between 43 billion and 66 billion 
miller said president reagan supports drought relief but is 
opposed to using the plight of the farmers as an opportunity to 
make a christmas tree out of that bill by loading it up with 
other farm assistance that has little to do with drought relief 
miller also listed as potential budgetbusters measures to step 
up the battle against illegal drugs and provide more aid the hungry 
and homeless 
he said if all the proposals were enacted by congress it would 
increase spending between 64 billion and 87 billion enough 
even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the automatic 
spending cuts 
we cant do all the things that congress has on its list right 
now miller told reporters at a white house briefing 
house budget committee chairman rep william gray dpa agreed 
that the administrations midsession review points up the need for 
lawmakers to make tough choices in coming weeks 
all of the urgent needs of the nation cannot be funded at the 
levels most of us would support in less difficult times gray 
said 
evans said he doubted that congress would risk triggering the 
acrosstheboard spending cuts especially since they would take 
effect only weeks before the november election 
i think miller is trying to hold peoples feet to the fire so 
congress doesnt go crazy with the drought bill but it would snow 
in july before congress would allow acrosstheboard spending cuts 
to go into effect evans said 
evans said that last year when congress faced similar budget 
problems it found a way to keep within the deficit targets by 
pushing 5 billion in spending from september to october the start 
of a new fiscal year he said if necessary lawmakers would resort 
to similar budgetary tricks this year to escape mandatory spending 
cuts 
the administrations midsession budget review projected that 
the budget deficit would decline steadily in coming years 
it forecast a 1990 deficit if congress accepts its proposals on 
further spending cuts of 1023 billion declining to 854 
billion in 1991 649 billion in 1992 and 342 billion in 1993 
the year the grammrudman deficit reduction law calls for the 
budget to be brought finally into balance

prime minister noboru takeshita told japans 
legislators friday that tax reform is the most important domestic 
issue facing the nation and urged them to approve the first major 
overhaul of the tax system since it was set up by us occupation 
forces in 1950 
in a speech before the japanese parliament the diet takeshita 
delivered a strong appeal for passage of a tax reform package he 
has pinpointed as a top item on his political agenda 
there is an urgent need to rectify distortions of the present 
tax system to institute a new tax system that is fair simple and 
acceptable to the people he said 
tax reform has been long awaited by the average japanese 
salaryearner who bears a heavy direct tax burden compared to 
selfemployed individuals and other categories of taxpayers who are 
eligible for substantial tax breaks 
takeshita said that if his package is approved taxpayers will 
win an unprecedented amount in tax cuts totaling 56 trillion yen 
the equivalent of 43 billion for fiscal 1988 ending next march 
but a shadow already looms over the tax reform plan 
opposition parties refused to open diet proceedings until the 
prime ministers ruling liberal democratic party agreed to 
substantial tax cuts they are also demanding the government scrap 
plans to introduce an indirect consumption tax of 3 percent on 
goods and services next april 
takeshita indicated he was prepared to compromise it is 
important that the tax burden be passed along smoothly and justly 
and the administration will work to create the right environment 
for this 
earlier friday the cabinet approved six tax bills making up 
takeshitas reform package due for debate in the diet in upcoming 
weeks 
the new plan calls for reducing the 12 brackets in the 
progressive income tax system with rates ranging from 105 percent 
to 60 percent to five brackets ranging from 10 to 50 percent 
residential taxes would also be reduced and corporate taxes would 
drop from 42 percent to 375 percent 
eight categories of goods and services have been earmarked as 
nontaxable including medical care education costs and capital 
gains from land transactions 
the 70day extraordinary diet session opened tuesday after a 
oneweek delay and after an agreement by the ruling party to 
investigate two recent developments the role of a government 
submarine in a marine disaster last saturday and the recent 
disclosure of unethical stock deals that reaped massive profits for 
government officials including a takeshita aide 
takeshita opened his speech with an apology over the collision 
between a military submarine and a leisure vessel that claimed 30 
civilian lives 
he also alluded to the legal but shady stock purchases in which 
selected individuals were offered shares of the recruitcosmos co 
a real estate firm prior to their release for overthecounter 
dealings 
we must always be mindful of political ethics and 
selfdiscipline in government service and it is imperative that 
we continually fulfill our responsibilities without even a hint of 
impropriety takeshita said 
the scandal involves more than a dozen prominent political and 
business leaders suspected of earning huge profits by obtaining the 
unlisted shares and then selling them after they were released on 
the market 
to date takeshita former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone and 
former foreign minister shintaro abe have admitted their aides at 
the time earned profits 
in japan however it generally known that aides act on behalf 
of the politicians they serve

japan posted a current account surplus of 643 
billion in june up 11 percent from the previous month but down 14 
percent from the same month last year the finance ministry 
announced friday 
in may japans current account surplus totaled 579 billion 
while in june 1987 it registered 75 billion 
the current account is the broadest measure of a countrys 
commerce measuring trade in goods and services as well as other 
capital flows 
ministry officials said imports continued to rise sharply during 
the month but they said exports also increased continuing the 
doubledigit rise that began last november despite the higher value 
of the japanese yen 
the officials said demand remained strong for japanese products 
in other countries including the united states 
the us economy has been doing very well and that is one of 
the major reasons for this increase despite the yens 
appreciation one official said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a higher yen makes japanese products more expensive and 
therefore less competitive overseas 
the officials said demand remained especially high for japanese 
items such as automobiles steel semiconductors and business 
machines 
japanese imports have been growing because of strong domestic 
demand resulting from japans current economic expansion and 
because of the higher yen which tends to reduce the cost of 
foreign products 
growth of imports of nonferrous metals lumber and steel was 
particularly strong during the month the officials said 
record numbers of japanese tourists traveling overseas taking 
advantage of the yens appreciation helped reduce the current 
account surplus the officials said 
the portion of the current account measuring flows of money 
related to tourism shipping insurance banking and commodity 
services showed a record deficit of 737 million during the month 
they said in may the figure was 612 million and in june 1987 it 
was 251 million

opec secretarygeneral 
subroto said he expects the price of oil to rise in coming weeks 
because of the possibility of an end to the persian gulf war 
according to a report published friday 
statements by subroto who heads the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries were published in the united arab 
emirates newspaper alittihad 
subroto was in the emirates for discussions on the oil market 
situation with uae leaders in advance of an opec pricing 
committee meeting in lausanne switzerland on aug 3 
the staterun alittihad quoted subroto as saying the world 
market looks forward to positive results from the pricing 
committee it said he expressed his expectation of an increase in 
oil prices over the coming weeks 
in subrotos view the paper said prices have been improving 
because of the prospects of a peaceful end to the nearly 8yearold 
war between iran and iraq 
that settlement would lead to a positive impact on the oil 
market and oil prices the paper further quoted subroto as saying 
but it said he could not predict whether prices would increase 
beyond the opec benchmark of 18 a barrel 
the pricing committee whose members are oil ministers of saudi 
arabia nigeria indonesia algeria and venezuela was meeting in 
wake of irans decision to accept a un security council 
ceasefire resolution to end its war with iraq 
subroto has toured opec member states seeking assurances about 
compliance with the cartels production quotas to help stabilize 
oil prices around the 18 benchmark 
because of the war iraq has refused to accept its opecdecreed 
quota and produces almost double what it is assigned meanwhile 
iran is widely accused of discounting prices to market its crude 
oil under the wartime conditions 
that could change if the war came to an end fueling hopes that 
prices could rise 
other opec member states have also violated the cartels 
production and pricing rules 
in june the uae said it would ignore its opec oil production 
quota of 948000 barrels and produce about 15 million barrels per 
day 
subroto has conferred with uae oil minister mana saeed otaiba 
and with uae president sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan to whom 
he delivered a message from the opec president and nigerian oil 
minister rilwanu lukman 
the official emirates news agency wam reported after the 
meetings thursday that sheik zayed affirmed his nations support 
for unity and cohesion within opec

japans exports of fourwheeled automobiles fell 
51 percent during the first six months of this year from the same

time auto exports grew from yearearlier levels was in the first 
half of 1986 when a 52percent increase was reported 
expanding production in the united states by japanese car makers

million vehicles accounting for 408 percent of the total

koppers co said today a planned 660 million 
leveraged buyout of its chemicals business has fallen through 
the announcement came a day after sources disclosed new concerns 
about the segments environmental liabilities that jeopardized the 
planned sale of the business to a group led by its management 
british businessman brian beazer had counted on the sale of the 
business to help finance his 18 billion takeover of koppers co 
while beazer was going to sell the business segment he would have 
retained responsibility for its past environmental liabilities 
gordon cain head of sterling group of houston and a specialist 
in chemicals industry buyouts was to be an equity partner with 
management 
koppers said it is now free to consider other offers for the 
business 
we have received a number of inquiries relating to this 
transaction over a period of several months beazer said this 
morning by telephone from koppers headquarters in pittsburgh 
we have not pursued those inquiries because of our undertaking 
to give exclusivity to the management group he said it is our 
intention to seek purchasers of a serious nature immediately and 
that is already under way 
we do not expect any difficulty beazer said 
beazer who prevailed june 1 in a bitter takeover battle against 
koppers former top management declined today to say whether he 
intends to sell the chemicals group as an entity or in pieces 
he said thursday that discussions about the chemicals buyout 
were continuing but those lastditch efforts proved fruitless 
one official at koppers headquarters who would not speak for 
attribution said managers of the chemicals segment were being told 
that a financial consultant to the deal had raised new concerns 
about the extent of koppers environmental liabilities that 
apparently created differences over the agreed purchase price 
breaking up the chemicals group would be a blow to the nearly 
2700 koppers employees who were expected to keep their jobs after 
the buyout 
the pittsburgh company also has major interests in construction 
materials which beazer wanted as an addition to his international 
construction operations 
glen c tenley slated to move from koppers president and chief 
operating officer to president and chief executive of the new 
company on thursday referred questions to beazer 
a wall street securities analyst who follows koppers said he was 
not surprised by the reports that environmental issues were at the 
root of the problem although he said he was unaware of the snag 
the company doesnt know what the liabilities are the epa 
gets around to these plent sites one at a time and until they get 
around to some of these places you dont know he said speaking 
on condition he not be named 
the analyst said cain is a smart guy and usually he sets these 
deals so that the environmental liabilities are covered hes been 
careful about that because its sucn an openended thing 
selling the chemicals businesses in pieces would take longer 
but they might get a better price he said 
in the battle against the beazer group koppers former top 
management argued in court documents that with environmental 
liabilities of 200 million over the next decade the chemicals 
business could not survive without cash from the construction 
materials business 
tenley has estimated the segments sales would grow from about 
600 million in 1987 to 1 billion in the 1990s it had operating 
profits of around 40 million last year

should americans be advising the japanese on how to 
take over american companies 
the issue raised a rumpus among americans in tokyo recently 
after the american chamber of commerce in japan and the american 
state offices association sponsored wellattended courses for 
japanese businessmen on how to acquire us companies 
representatives of several state offices complained that such 
seminars were against the rules of the chamber of commerce and 
both of the sponsors had to defend the seminars 
to have a seminar here in tokyo a threehour seminar and not 
touch on the subject of hostile takeovers would be incomplete 
answered william franklin president of the chamber of commerce in 
japan adding that the chamber was not promoting hostile takeovers 
the debate over japanese takeovers is gaining momentum both here 
and in the united states as japanese investors expand their 
american interests beyond government securities and real estate 
just last week nomura securities co japans biggest securities 
house bought a 20 percent stake in wasserstein perella amp co one 
of americas hottest mergerandacquisition firms 
speakers at the japanese seminars described how to target us 
companies for acquisition how to prepare proxy statements for the 
securities and exchange commission and ways to avoid antagonizing 
american employees and customers of the companies they are taking 
over 
also covered were such subjects as how to conduct friendly 
neutral or hostile takeovers 
an accountant told the businessmen how to spot companies in 
trouble a businessman told them how to recognize and avoid bluffs 
by american companies and another participant advised the japanese 
that they often paid more for american companies than necessary 
billy cody director of oregons representative office in japan 
said the state offices association has no business teaching 
japanese how to take over an american company whether or not it 
wants to be taken over 
the american state offices association which represents the 39 
us states with offices in japan to promote trade and investment 
in their states sent out a letter saying it does not censor 
speeches of experts who appear at such seminars 
the association does not in any way promote hostile takeovers 
by japanese companies in the us and data substantiates that this 
is not even a primary or common form of japanese investment in the 
united states the letter said 
the course was first offered in osaka attended by more than 100 
persons many of them japanese businessmen following objections 
over a portion of the course that dwelt on hostile takeovers the 
course was modified and offered again in early july in tokyo 
drawing more than 150 businessmen most of them japanese 
franklin said mergers and acquisitions are a fact of life in 
american business and the seminars were designed to make the 
japanese better informed 
the controversy placed the chamber in an awkward situation 
because it wants to guide the japanese in investing their surplus 
cash in the united states and thus to stave off protectionist 
sentiment in congress 
the us government and many american companies have welcomed 
japanese investment as long as us management is left intact and 
american consultants are active in tokyo advising the japanese on 
takeover prospects 
so far japanese companies have been content to play the role of 
white knights who rescue companies from unwanted invaders 
however participants at the seminars urged the japanese to be more 
aggressive and seek out companies that might be ripe for mergers 
mie teno chairman of the invest in usa committee of the 
chamber of commerce told the tokyo seminar that mergers and 
acquisitions are a good way to get into business in the united 
states quickly and without a lot of startup costs 
compared with the united states where takeovers are commonplace 
and even the biggest corporations are targets there are few 
takeovers in japan japanese companies tend to hold large blocks of 
each others stock permanently creating alliances and making it 
difficult to mount a hostile takeover attempt 
cody said japanese companies have a paternalistic feeling toward 
their employees and believe that selling part of their company is 
like selling a member of the family 
not only would this not happen in japan government and 
businesses would work together to prevent it the oregon 
representative said 
according to yamaichi securities co japanese companies 
concluded 469 mergers and acquisitions in 1987 and 451 in 1986 of 
those mergers more than 200 each year were outside japan last 
year for the first time foreign takeovers by japanese companies 
exceeded domestic takeovers 
only about 22 foreign companies in 1986 and 25 in 1987 were able 
to acquire japanese companies according to an investment broker 
who asked that he not be identified 
the first foreign hostile takeover bid against a major japanese 
firm ended in failure last year when trafalgar holdings ltd of the 
united states and glen international of britain sold the shares 
they had acquired in the japanese minebea co the japanese 
government had decided that much of minebeas business was 
defenserelated and should not be sold to an outsider

when revlon group made a hostile bid to seize 
bostons own gillette co gov michael s dukakis engineered 
passage of a state antitakeover law and signed it with fanfare on 
a gillette softball fied 
when campeau corp bought federated department stores dukakis 
asked the federal trade commission to review the 66 billion 
purchase which included filenes basement the discount store 
where the governor buys his suits 
on the campaign trail the democratic presidential nominee has 
said mergermania is tearing companies apart as if they were 
erector sets and he has called for tougher enforcement of 
federal antitrust laws and regulations to protect management 
against takeover artists seeking to make a fast buck 
in a state where sharks circle regularly around corporate giants 
such as gillette and polaroid corp dukakis portrayed as a 
liberal by his republican opponents has forged an alliance with 
management in attacking corporate raiders 
hes very concerned about hostile takeovers that lead to 
protracted battles cost jobs might result in paying greenmail and 
dont create new economic value said harvard business school 
professor rosabeth moss kanter 
however hes very well aware that there are a large number of 
mergers and acquisitions and some takeovers that replace weak 
management with stronger management or result in combinations that 
do create new economic value the dukakis adviser said this past 
week 
wall street analysts acknowledge some trepidation among 
potential buyers over a possible dukakis presidency some fear he 
will try to curb takeovers others worry that a recession will 
dampen the merger wave as it did after last years stock market 
crash with the future uncertain merger activity has spurted in 
recent months 
there is some basis to say that were dukakis to win then 
antitrust enforcement would be more vigorous than under the reagan 
administration said les fabuss senior vice president for 
mergers at shearson lehman hutton inc but i dont think dukakis 
would be draconian on this he tends to be middleoftheroad is my 
impression 
dukakis is on the record supporting measures to curb hostile 
takeovers including 
a senate bill sponsored by sen william proxmire dwis to 
force raiders to make their efforts more public 
outlawing greenmail the premium paid by a company to buy back 
stock from a raider who agrees to drop a takeover bid 
reducing the 10day period in which a company can acquire a 
block of another companys stock without disclosing whether it 
intends to mount a takeover 
stricter enforcement of antitrust and insider trading laws 
barring firms from using pension fund surpluses to repay debts 
incurred during takeover financing 
i dont want to stop mergers and acquisitions in this 
country the candidate told forbes magazine in an interview 
appearing in the aug 8 issue but youve got a lot of 
responsible business people who would suggest that there are 
reasonable rules of the game beginning with antitrust policy that 
you can believe in 
in hightech massachusetts dukakis has tried to discourage 
hostile takeovers that force companies relying on longterm 
research and development to focus on boosting shortterm profits to 
defend against raiders 
massachusetts antitakeover law followed revlon chairman ronald 
o perelmans failed bid for gillette in 1986 in which the 
personal care giant paid 558 million to buy back 92 million 
shares of stock gillette currently is involved in a legal battle 
with coniston group of new york which wants to gain control of the 
company and sell it to the highest bidder 
in february when stop amp shop cos came under siege from the 
dart group dukakis cosponsored legislation giving corporate 
directors the right to consider the interests of workers the 
community and the economy in weighing a takeover the bill died in 
committee after the takeover attempt failed 
dukakis also commissioned a panel from government business 
labor and academia to assess massachusetts antitakeover law 
similar to ones passed in about 20 other states and report to him 
by october 
under the state law the voting rrs acquiring 20 
percent of a company can be suspended for up to 50 days so 
management and shareholders can evaluate the bid 
opponents maintain that antitakeover laws strip power from 
stockholders and allow incumbenights of investot management to perpetuate 
inefficiency by failing to respond to market forces 
if they fall short theres nobody there to snap at their 
heels and say improve your performance or we can make more money 
for the shareholders said joseph lufkin of the united 
shareholders association they dont feel the pressure to 
compete 
coniston partner paul e tierney who supports dukakis 
presidential bid said antitakeover legislation has made strange 
bedfellows of democratic politicians like dukakis and typically 
conservative company management 
i think democratic legislators hearts are with the work 
force in massachusetts but they are passing laws and giving 
speeches that essentially protect m salvadors history has 
benefited more than half a million people since its inception in 
1980 and is radically changing the social structure of the

officials as a means of undercutting the leftist guerrillas in

the dollar was higher against major currencies in 
european markets friday in expectation of higher us interest 
rates and despite heavy intervention by central banks 
gold and silver rose 
the dollar was bolstered because all the signs point to a 
higher interest rate environment in the united states according 
to marek stefamovicz a corporate advisor at nomura bank 
international 
he and other dealers said the market interpreted remarks 
thursday by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan to mean 
monetary authorities in the united states are worried about 
inflationary pressures 
in particular they pointed to greenspans comment that he found 
the 41 percent inflation rate in the second quarter as indicated 
by the gross national product deflator a bit surprising 
dealers in frankfurt said repeated dollar sales by the us

a rumor later in the day that the soviet union was in the market 
for corn prompted further buying of corn futures 
a soybean production estimate of 156 billion bushels by 
meatpacker conagra corp compared to the agriculture departments 
latest estimate of 165 billion bushels added further support to 
the soybeans analysts said 
and private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain 
this weekend in the droughtstricken farm belt lent strength across 
the board 
at the close wheat was 10 cents to 17 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 368 a bushel corn was 6 
cents to 10 cents higher with september at 275 a bushel oats 
were 7 cents to the limit 15 cents higher with september at 271 
a bushel soybeans were 9 cents to 34 cents higher with august at 
776 a bushel

koppers co on friday announced the collapse 
of a 660 million deal to sell its chemicals division to a 
managementled group 
the sale would have helped british construction magnate brian 
beazer finance his 18 billion purchase of koppers beazer said he 
was optimistic other buyers could be found for the chemicals 
business 
the announcement came a day after sources said that recent 
concerns about the chemical segments environmental liabilities 
were jeopardizing the agreement for beazer to sell the operations 
to managers and their outside partner 
beazer and his takeover partners shearson lehman hutton inc 
and a british bank had agreed to remain responsible for the 
environmental liabilities after the leveraged buyout 
beazer expressed confidence friday that a sale can be arranged 
with other parties 
we have received a number of inquiries relating to this 
transaction over a period of several months he said by telephone 
from koppers headquarters in pittsburgh we have not pursued 
those inquiries because of our undertaking to give exclusivity to 
the management group it is our intention to seek purchasers of a 
serious nature immediately and that is already under way we do 
not expect any difficulty 
beazer gave the managers the exclusive right to negotiate for 
the business the managers will now have to compete with outside 
bidders if they are to salvage their plan 
asked what killed the managementled buyout beazer told the 
pittsburgh press you should ask gordon cain we have a signed 
contract and are prepared to honor it 
cain head of the sterling group of houston is a chemicals 
industry financier he was an equity partner with the koppers 
managers and was announced as the chairman of the new koppers 
chemical co 
cains office on friday referred all questions to koppers 
glen c tenley the koppers president and chief operating 
officer who was to become president and chief executive of koppers 
chemical was out of his office friday and not expected back until 
monday a secretary said 
beazer said thursday that discussions were continuing in an 
apparent lastditch effort to save the chemicals buyout 
after bitter resistance in federal court koppers former top 
management conceded defeat and agreed june 1 to sell the company 
for 61 per share to beazer and shearon lehman hutton 
beazer wanted koppers in order to add its construction materials 
business to his international construction operations 
the ousted management estimated the chemical segments 
environmental liabilities as 200 million over the next decade

the first big failure of a leveraged buyout 
failed to stir the junkbond market friday and analysts predicted 
the bankruptcy filing by drugstore chain revco ds inc would 
concern few holders of other highrisk corporate bonds 
revco which announced its filing thursday is the only major 
company to seek protection from its creditors after going private 
in a junkbond financed buyout 
many people had expected it the chapter 11 filing said 
robert waill managing director and junk bond analyst at lf 
rothschild amp co in new york there had been a general 
understanding from investors that this was risky 
the twinsburg ohiobased company failed to make a june interest 
payment on about 700 million in outstanding debt that was used to 
go private 19 months ago the company sought protection from 
creditors after talks with bondholders broke down 
there was no ripple effect said robert levine director of 
highyield bond research for kidder peabody amp co in new york 
as a result traders said prices of most junk bonds remained 
fairly firm in the secondary market friday including some of 
revcos securities 
junk bonds are highyield highrisk notes commonly issued to 
fund leveraged buyouts and other types of corporate takeovers in a 
leveraged buyout a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds 
that are repaid with the companys cash flow or sale of its assets 
some traders and analysts even predicted that revco bonds might 
rebound after the chain files its reoganization plan with the 
bankruptcy court and gets back on its feet financially 
all of revcos debt had been considered speculative grade or 
junk a category assigned by the big creditrating services for 
companies considered more likely to default on their bonds due to a 
variety of reasons including tough economic conditions in a 
particular industry 
junk bond yields are generally three to four percentage points 
higher than comparable treasury bonds to compensate for their low 
rating making them attractive to some investors 
the majority of junk bond buyers are large sophisticated 
institutional investors rather than individuals who diversify 
their portfolios enough to compensate for future risks 
revcos problem resulted from the heavy debt load incurred as a 
result of its leveraged buyout in december 1986 the company listed 
its total debt as 15 billion in the bankruptcy filing 
chairman boake a sells said thursday that the companys 
investment adviser planned to propose a recapitalization that would 
have swapped equity in revco for debt but he said discussions with 
major bondholders broke down even before the plan was proposed 
sells maintained that most of revcos 2000 drug stores were 
profitable but that the company was not generating enough cash to 
both operate its business and make millions of dollars in annual 
interset payments 
revco is the only leveraged buyout company that has failed to 
meet its obligations to bondholders according to gail i hessol a 
managing director of standard amp poors corp 
in all of 1987 there was a record 9 billion in corporate 
defaults she said as of june 21 there were 2 billion in 
defaults 
waill said as a result of the revco filing i dont think 
people would say that this teaches us a lesson that we should be 
more careful of lbos 
investors tend to look at this as an isolated separate event 
which was determined by its own particulars he said unlike 
highgrade bonds each of these junk bond companies lives its own 
life

prudentialbache securities inc fired a broker 
friday and advest inc said it suspended one in connection with a 
widening probe of possibly fraudulent trading based on advance 
leaks of business week articles 
another firm shearson lehman hutton inc disclosed that up to 
three former brokers may have traded improperly on advance 
knowledge of the information as well 
and rr donnelley amp sons co of chicago one of the companies 
that prints business week said federal authorities had subpoenaed 
lists of its employees at two printing plants near the offices 
where the affected brokers worked 
the moves came a day after merrill lynch inc said it had fired 
a broker because of suspicious trades surrounding stocks touted in 
business week 
prudentialbache said it had dismissed brian callahan a broker 
in its 33member office in anaheim calif after it detected 
questionable trading by him the firm said it had notified the 
securities and exchange commission the federal agency that 
enforces securities laws 
peter costiglio a spokesman at prudentialbaches headquarters 
in new york said callahan 28 had worked for the firm for about 
3 years 
executives at prudentialbaches anaheim office referred all 
queries about callahan to costiglio who said he did not know the 
whereabouts of the broker 
directory assistance said there was no listing for a brian 
callahan in anaheim 
advest based in hartford conn said the broker it suspended 
worked in the firms office in new london conn where 10 brokers 
are based spokeswoman martha payne declined to disclose the 
brokers identity or career history 
the suspension was the result of an internal investigation 
which we conducted she said weve notified the securities and 
exchange commission the investigation is continuing 
shearson said in a statement that an undisclosed number of 
exbrokers in the hartford conn office of ef hutton group 
inc which shearson acquired last december may have accepted 
and executed trades based on advance knowledge of articles that 
were published in business week 
a source at shearson speaking on condition of anonymity said 
at least one and possibly three brokers were involved but said 
their whereabouts were not clear 
the statement said the questionable trades occured prior to the 
acquisition and the brokers are no longer with the company it said 
the sec and new york stock exchange had been notified but provided 
no further details 
the disclosures widened to four the number of brokerages 
involved since business week the nations leading business weekly 
with a circulation of nearly 1 million said last week it was 
investigating whether stock trading was occuring based on leaks of 
its unpublished inside wall street columns

business week shared information about the marketmoving columns 
with brokers before the magazine was available to the public 
two of the four plants that publish business week are in old 
saybrook conn near new london and in torrance calif near 
anaheim 
business week officials have said there is no indication that 
any of the magazines editorial staff is involved

brought against former wall street journal reporter r foster 
winans who sold tips about his impending stock columns to broker 
peter n brant both were convicted for trading based on stolen 
confidential information 
merrill lynch said thursday it had fired broker william dillon

the magazine has retained a highpowered new york detective 
agency kroll associates to assist its investigation kroll has 
been involved in several major securities probes particularly 
those involving insider trading proxy fights and hostile takeovers 
business week ackowledged it was investigating possible leaks 
after dow jones professional investor report made the initial 
disclosure about possible misuse of information in the column 
professional investor report said its analysis of 20 stocks 
mentioned in the column had found at least eight rose sharply the 
day the magazines came off the presses but before they were 
available to the public 
the sec and the major stock exchanges also are investigating the 
matter

the japanese have invaded the us financial 
markets in a big way again 
in samurai style nippon telegraph and telephone corp issued 
500 million in 10year notes one of the largest foreign bond 
issues ever floated in this country according to its underwriters 
the july 19 issue was snapped up by us institutional investors 
hungry for oldfashioned triplea bonds even if they arent 
american 
with a dwindling number of triplea us corporate bonds now on 
the market analysts say theres plenty of room for yankee 
bonds issued by foreign governments and companies to raise 
capital most of which also carry the top rating 
yankee bonds are issued in the united states by foreign 
entities and regulated by the securities and exchange commission 
i dont see any kind of volume that cant be absorbed said 
jim nickelson a senior vice president of daiwa securities inc 
there havent been enough triplea issues to really saturate 
the market 
in recent years a number of major us banks that had enjoyed 
triplea ratings were stripped of them by the creditrating 
agencies after they took steep losses on loans to developing 
countries some big oil companies were similarly downgraded after 
the world oil price slide in 1985 
even more recently the surge in corporate takeover activity in 
this country has brought downgraded ratings for some bluechip 
companies that piled up their debt to pay for big acquisitions 
dwindling ranks no question about that said john lonski 
senior economist for moodys investors service referring to the 
number of triplea us companies moodys is one of the top rating 
agencies along with standard amp poors corp 
there are currently 13 us companies with triplea ratings from 
both moodys and standard amp poors lonski noted down from 18 in 
1981 
the survivors include international business machines corp 
exxon corp amoco corp procter amp gamble co morgan guaranty 
trust co aetna life amp casualty co and some of the regional 
telephone companies 
theres a peculiar irony here some us industrial giants like 
general motors corp lost their triplea imprimaturs largely as a 
result of competition from japanese companies now japanese 
conglomerates like nippon telegraph and japan air lines are jumping 
into the triplea void with big bond issues in the united states 
like nippon telegraph other foreign companies have been raising 
capital in the united states with big bond issues earlier this 
month the west german bank for economic progress sold 300 million 
in 10year notes in the us market and the governments of sweden 
and finland recently issued what daiwas nickelson calls real 
barnburners 40 and 50year bonds that fetched high prices 
conservative us investors love the yankee bond market 
said larry kreicher an international economist and bond strategist 
for merrill lynch capital markets 
many of the foreign bonds offer investors highquality 
regulated securities which still sell for less than us treasury 
issues kreicher explained he noted that the yankee market has 
grown from 37 billion in 1985 to a projected 68 billion this 
year 
what makes the nippon telegraph issue noteworthy is the size of 
the company as well as the magnitude of the sale the japanese 
utility can be considered the biggest company in the world with a 
stock market value of around 300 billion 
thats equivalent to the combined market values of these giants 
ibm exxon both rated triplea general electric co american 
telephone and telegraph co ford motor co gm merck amp co inc 
philip morris companies inc and du pont according to the 
investment firm goldman sachs amp co 
the nippon telegraph sale was a museumpiece issue said 
michael lynch a senior partner in the global finance department of 
goldman sachs the lead underwriter of the issue its such a 
strong entity its hard to extricate it from the japanese 
economy 
the giant utility had been part of the japanese government until 
april 1985 when the government sold 25 percent of its shares to 
the public 
other stateowned japanese companies that are on the drawing 
boards to be privatized in the near future such as japanese 
national railways and japan tobacco co also are strong 
candidates for bond issues in the us market

macmillan inc the target of a pair of 
unsolicited takeover bids said friday its board has authorized 
management to evaluate the possibility of selling all or parts of 
the company and other options 
the publishing and information services concern said the board 
gave those instructions as it voted to oppose a tender offer from a 
group led by texas investor robert m bass that values the company 
at 19 billion the board called the bid inadequate 
macmillan said its board authorized management to explore a 
variety of alternatives including another version of its proposed 
restructuring that has been tied up in court a merger or the sale 
of all or parts of the company 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission 
macmillan said it had discussed with unidentified third parties 
their interest in a possible acquisition of all or part of the 
company but that no negotiations occurred 
the company said it had provided confidential information to one 
third party and might provide information to others and said it 
could engage in negotiations in the future 
but at the same time the company said the board reaffirmed its 
intention for a vigorous appeal of a delaware court decision that 
blocked implementation of its restructuring plan the company said 
the appeal would be heard aug 15 
the announcement of the boards rejection of the 75ashare 
tender offer launched last week by the bass group came as no 
surprise 
british entrepreneur robert maxwell already indicated he was 
prepared to offer 80 a share under certain conditions for all of 
macmillans 259 million shares or about 206 billion 
on wall street traders anticipated that the bidding for 
macmillan might go higher macmillan rose 87 cents a share to 
8462 in composite new york stock exchange trading 
bruce thorp a media analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia said he thought macmillans top priority was to 
pursue its restructuring 
if the delaware supreme court refused to allow the company to 
proceed with the current restructuring plan thorp said the company 
might then have to seek outside help to sweeten its restructuring 
plan or find a friendly buyer 
bert boksen who follows the publishing business for raymond 
james amp associates in st petersburg fla said the board appeared 
to have told management to come up with a reasonable 
alternative 
this forces macmillan management to respond to legitimate 
offers he said boksen said management might well find the 
course of least resistance would be to find suitable buyer for the 
whole company 
thorp repeated his estimate that macmillan might be worth about 
85 a share while boksen said it could be worth about 90 a share 
in its statement macmillan said its board rejected the latest 
bass offer at a meeting on thursday and would recommend to 
macmillan shareholders that they not tender their shares under 
terms of that offer 
a call was placed to the bass group which is based in fort 
worth texas but its spokesman was said to be unavailable for 
comment 
macmillan said its board was notified about maxwells proposal 
but determined to review that proposal in due course in light of 
the companys other alternatives 
the bass group which owns a 91 percent stake in macmillan 
proposed in midmay to pay 64 a share for the macmillan stock it 
did not already own 
macmillan subsequently proposed a restructuring that would pay 
shareholders a special dividend and split the company into two 
separate entities a publishing company and an information services 
concern 
the bass group challenged the restructuring plan in delaware 
chancery court which blocked macmillan from putting it into 
effect bass also sweetened its bid for macmillan first to 73 a 
share and then to 75 a share and launched a tender offer at the 
higher price on july 18 
maxwells proposal contained several conditions including 
macmillans dropping the restructuring plan maxwell communications 
corp the company maxwell heads is the largest printer in 
britain owns the mirror group of newspapers there and publishes 
scientific journals 
maxwell has said he wants to make his company one of the worlds 
largest communications concerns and has spent 1 billion making 
smaller acquisitions in the united states over the past year he 
failed in a bid last year to acquire harcourt brace jovanovich 
inc a floridabased publishing insurance and theme park concern

the federal government and the new york stock 
exchange said friday they are examining an apparently bogus claim 
of a large investment in general cinema corp that triggered a 
sharp rise in the price of the companys stock 
securities experts said the filing by an unknown london man from 
a fictitious london address of a 61 percent stock acquisition in 
the soft drink bottler and movie theater operator raises questions 
about securities and exchange commission guidelines 
its very disconcerting said sam scott miller a new york 
securities lawyer the system is designed to provide for very 
speedy dissemination which is highly desirable to let the public 
know when someone takes a position but the incident certainly 
shows that can be taken advantage of by someone 
general cinema based in chestnut hill received a brown manila 
envelope with no return address and a new jersey postmark late 
thursday morning 
inside was a copy of a letter to the sec from a kile johnasen of 
15 apple st london and a copy of a partial 13d form required 
whenever an investor holds more than 5 percent of a stock the man 
said he used personal funds to acquire 28 million shares of 
general cinema worth about 61 million 
but london directory information showed no one named johnasen 
and london police told the company there is no apple street in the 
city general cinema spokesman peter farwell said 
we thought it was hoax when it arrived here he said the 
copy that was made the fact that it wasnt a completed 13d made 
us feel it was a hoax 
but shortly after 2 pm thursday the dow jones news service 
carried the report of the filing with the sec in washington on its 
financial wires before the company could react the stock which 
opened at 2087 a share rose to a high of 2325 before closing 
at 2175 the stock was unchanged friday 
its a serious matter farwell said people are making 
investment decisions you want them made on accurate information 
sec filings are not reviewed before being made public balancing 
the need to ensure the authenticity of the secs 70000 annual 
filings with the publics right to quickly learn about major stock 
acquisitions is difficult securities experts said 
when a messenger walks in with a filing how do you know the 
messenger didnt print it up in his basement said ira lee 
sorkin a former sec regional administrator now working as a 
whitecollar crime and securities lawyer in new york 
filings occur all the time he said how do you check each 
one its a very difficult process 
sorkin said false filings are not uncommon but typically 
involve misrepresentation of facts and not outright fiction form 
13d filings sometimes are the first sign of a takeover bid and can 
influence stock trading heavily 
sec spokesman chiles larson said the commission was examining 
the general cinema filing 
if a filing comes in to the commission its received by a 
clerk through the mail larson said clerks are not really 
securities analysts the commission holds all respondents 
responsible for the accuracy 
new york stock exchange spokeswoman sharon gamsin said general 
cinema had asked the exchange to review the incident and well 
certainly cooperate 
miller the securities lawyer called on the sec to review its 
guidelines and impose safeguards 
i think the sec and the securities bar should think hard about 
how safeguards could be implemented without impeding the speed and 
efficiency of the system he said in retrospect were 
fortunate this hasnt happened more often 
the stock price jump was considered unusual because general 
cinema chairman richard smith owns about 30 percent of the 
companys stock including virtually all of its class b stock both 
of which are needed to approve any change in control 
i think the bizarrest part was that the market reacted to 
it said harry e wells an analyst with adams harkness amp hill 
dick smith has total control of the company the odds are 
somewhere between slim and none that he would ever sell a 13d 
with general cinema means absolutely zip why the market went up a 
point is beyond me 
general cinema also owns neimanmarcus department stores and 
acquired an 184 percent interest in cadbury schweppes plc of 
london earlier this year

the stock market climbed sharply friday in a 
robust rally that surprised traders and lured institutional 
investors from the sidelines 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed at 212873 up 
4640 points in its largest oneday advance since june 8 when the 
index rose 4836 the dow averages gain on the week totaled 6774 
points 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 15 to 4 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
1178 issues up 329 down and 470 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the nyse came to 19234 million shares 
up from 15457 million in the previous session nationwide 
consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including trading at 
regional exchanges and on the overthecounter market totaled 
21791 million shares 
the markets advance steadily gained momentum and breadth 
throughout the session peppered with computertriggered buying 
activity 
the dow averages push above the 2100 level at midday helped 
lure money from the institutional investors who had been reluctant 
to participate 
the rally took most traders by surprise said hugh johnson 
senior vice president at first albany corp noting that many had 
expected it would be a typical summer day 
pointing to volume higher than the anemic levels seen earlier in 
the week as well as broad overall increases in stock prices 
johnson said the rally was healthier than those weve seen 
recently 
the dow average climbed more than 28 points in the previous 
session but the advance mostly was confined to blue chip and 
technology issues 
this was encouraging market behavior that suggests we could 
break out of the malaise johnson said 
analysts attributed the advance to fresh strength in the dollar 
and continued favorable reaction to comments by federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspan who indicated thursday that the fed hasnt 
changed credit policy recently 
the comments served to quiet some fears that have been 
reflected in bond prices johnson said 
with the spotlight off interest rates investors were able to 
turn attention to the positive corporate earnings reports pouring 
in over the past few weeks investors had been reluctant to react 
to the favorable reports for fear that higher interest rates would 
dilute corporate profits down the road 
analysts were optimistic that the market could build on gains in 
the coming week i love to see a rally on a friday in the summer 
because a lot of people arent here to participate and hopefully 
the decision makers will come back monday and further the rally 
said philip puccio a senior vice president at dillon read amp co 
among actively traded big board issues ibm rose 2 to 125

stock dealers have been faced for some time with 
an emotional dilemma over the japanese equities market envy and 
fear 
riding japans postwar economic boom the tokyo market soared 
both before and after octobers bloody stock market collapse while 
traders here might be green with envy over that markets stellar 
performance many maintain that a crack is inevitable 
the tokyo markets recent volatility has only served to heighten 
concerns that trace back more than a year 
its like dealing with las vegas said one trader in new 
york theres a great amount of paranoia we know its going to 
crack we just dont know when 
during the week ended july 22 the key nikkei 225share index 
suffered its biggest singleday drop ever and a net loss of 590 
points for the week the tokyo market recouped in the past week 
with the nikkei index gaining a net 610 points despite signals that 
japanese economic growth might be flagging 
the japanese government reported that its index of leading 
indicators measured 40 in may the first time in 17 months the 
index sank below 50 which is considered the base number indicating 
an expanding economy 
stan weinstein editor and publisher of the professional tape 
reader newsletter in hollywood fla sees fissures in japans 
stock market irrespective of whats going on the economy 
among those problems are a technical weakening of certain issues 
and the psychological inability among investors to acknowlege any 
downside potential both of which could spark a serious 
downward move within the next 18 months weinstein said 
the nikkei index plowed beyond its precrash high even after 
shellshocked foreigners sold some 21 billion in japanese 
securities in october and november last year 
although the broader japanese market has not advanced as 
impressively as the nikkei nobody can concede it will go down 
weinstein said some are talking about 35000 in the nikkei 
index which closed the week at the 27900 level he said 
indeed hideo karino general manager of foreign stock trading 
at nikko securities co international inc said the tokyo market 
is going into a golden age its going to be the nifty 90s 
he said predicting further advances for at least three or four 
more years 
here at home the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had 
traded as high as 2722 last august finished the week up 6774 at 
212873 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 380 to 
15335 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 002 to 38733 and the american stock exchange market value 
index edged up 007 to 30618 
volume on the big board averaged 16398 million shares a day 
against 15013 million the week before 
karino explained that japanese fund managers who are faced with 
low interest rates at home have little choice but to invest in 
equities wall street he says in contrast is in a recession 
because most investors would like to keep their money in cash 
american traders complain bitterly that the japanese market is 
rigged since large corporations typically own big stakes in 
each other that they do not sell in addition they say that 
japanese government involvement in the market would preclude any 
sharp downward spike 
they have a vested interest in trying to kite the market 
higher weinstein said but there always comes a point where 
enough is enough and japan is reaching that point 
some have criticized the japanese market as being driven by 
rumors while traders in the united states are more apt to take a 
formalized technical approach stocks buying and selling based on 
company performances and fundamental economic data 
perhaps were a little wiser weinstein said weve seen 
1929 and know what happens after that 
in the short term however a selloff in japan can be positive 
for domestic markets japanese investors who dump stocks in tokyo 
are likely to put that money into us stocks and bonds 
american traders probably are overreacting when they point to 
japan as the epicenter of the next international economic cataclysm 
but on the other side the japanese are just so complacent 
about their market they think it can continue to go up so its 
like these two investor classes are living in two totally different 
worlds one analyst said 
experts say the japanese market is characterized by two extremes 
foreigners who fear they are about to fall through a trap door 
and japanese who think it can go on forever

grain and sobyean futures scored their first major advance in 
more than two weeks friday and many other commodity markets 
followed suit reversing a trend of generally falling prices 
but a surprising government report showing the nations cattle 
herd to be larger than many experts had predicted was expected to 
bring a sharp drop in cattle futures prices next week 
livestock and meat futures settled mixed friday ahead of that 
report 
on other exchanges sugar coffee and precious metals futures 
all rebounded stockinterest futures advanced sharply and most 
energy futures gained 
a basketful of bullish factors sparked a buying binge in grain 
and soybean pits of the chicago board of trade 
mr excitement jumped in here today said jerry gidel an 
analyst with gh miller amp co in chicago 
most corn and soybean futures soared their respective daily 
limits of 10 cents and 30 cents a bushel while the limitless august 
soybean contract gained more than 34 cents 
an overnight increase in cash corn prices spurred some 
hedgetype buying of corn futures by commerical grain dealers and 
processors analysts said 
a rumor later in the day that the soviet union was in the market 
for corn prompted further buying of corn futures 
the depressed soybean market attracted bargain hunters early in 
the session then meatpacker conagra inc released a prediction 
that this years us soybean production would total 156 billion 
bushels compared to the agriculture departments latest estimate 
of 165 billion bushels which added further support to the soybean 
market gidel said 
wheat prices advanced on news of new export sales and on the 
usdas decision not to reduce from the current 10 percent the 
portion of their acreage that wheat growers must set aside to 
qualify for federal price supports 
there had been a lot of talk of it going down to 5 percent so 
that got the wheat market off to a good start gidel said 
private weather forecasts reducing the prospects for rain this 
weekend in the droughtstricken farm belt lent strength across the 
board analysts said 
after the close the national weather service issued several 
forecasts predicting warm and dry conditions in the midwest next 
weekend a mixed precipitation picture in the farm belt during 
august and abovenormal rainfall in the region in september and 
october 
wheat settled 10 cents to 18 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in september at 368 a bushel corn was 6 cents to 10 
cents higher with september at 275 a bushel oats were 7 cents to 
the limit 15 cents higher with september at 271 a bushel 
soybeans were 9 cents to 34 cents higher with august at 776 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the chicago 
mercantile exchange ahead of the usdas semiannual cattle 
inventory report which was widely expected to show about a 2 
percent reduction from a year ago in the nations cattle herd 
but the report showed the cattle herd to be down only 1 percent 
at 1079 million head basically because of a 1988 calf crop that 
was larger than expected 
thomas morgan president of sterling research corp in arlington 
heights ill said the estimated calf crop of 402 million head 
indicated the bovine birth rate during the first half of the year 
was the thirdhighest in the past 17 years 
thats where the biggest part of the surprise came in he 
said 
prices of cattle for delivery next year have generally been 
rising on the assumption that this years drought will cut into 
next years cattle supply 
but analysts predicted prices of 1989 cattle futures would 
plunge on monday because of the large calf number 
live cattle were 15 cent to 55 cent higher with august at 
6682 cents a pound feeder cattle were 55 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with august at 7945 cents a pound hogs were 03 cent lower 
to 60 cent higher with august at 4387 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 43 cent lower to 65 cent higher with august at 3052 
cents a pound 
sugar and coffee futures rebounded from three days of sharp 
declines in mostly technical buying on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange 
september coffee settled 93 cent higher at 12472 a pound 
october sugar was 72 cent higher at 1154 cents a pound 
the inflationary implications of rising commodity prices 
combined with a drop in treasury bond interest rates gave precious 
metals futures a boost on new yorks commodity exchange analysts 
said 
gold settled 350 to 410 higher with august at 43610 a troy 
ounce silver was 95 cents to 102 cents higher with september at 
6855 a troy ounce 
the decline in interest rates also helped trigger a sharp rise 
in stockindex futures on the chicago mercantile exchange where 
the contract for september delivery of the standard amp poors 500 
index settled 640 points higher at 27325 
energy futures prices made slight gains on the new york 
mercantile exchange in light trading dominated mostly by technical 
factors 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 16 cents to 21 cents 
higher with september at 1631 a barrel heating oil was 14 cent 
to 40 cent higher with august at 4466 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 21 cent lower to 87 cent higher with august at 5174

bond prices rose friday bolstered by the 
dollars resilient rise against other major currencies 
the gains were greatest in longerterm issues the treasurys 
closely watched 30year bond rose about point or 375 for every 
1000 in face value its yield which moves inversely to its price 
and is often an indicator of interest rate trends dropped to 921 
percent from 926 percent late thursday 
analysts said bond prices got a lift from the advancing dollar 
which defied the efforts of some central banks to drive the us 
currency lower by selling dollars in the open market the dollar 
rose to 13314 japanese yen in late trading in new york from 13255 
yen late thursday 
i think you had to be impressed said marilyn cohen 
president of capital insight an investment firm in beverly hills 
calif this was a very good day for the bond market 
a falling dollar on the other hand tends to erode the value of 
dollardenominated investments such as treasury bonds 
bond values also drew support analysts said from indications 
by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan that the central bank 
was not changing its credit policy 
reserve data shows the fed has not really tightened credit 
and that was confirmed by greenspan said sung won sohn chief 
economist at norwest corp a bank holding company in minneapolis 
the fed chairman testified before a congressional committee 
thursday 
tighter monetary policy tends to push interest rates up driving 
bond prices lower 
earlier this week bond prices fell as interest rates rose amid 
speculation the fed was tightening credit to restrain rising 
inflation which devalues fixedincome securities such as bonds and 
notes 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues gained 116 point to point intermediate 
maturities rose 532 point to 932 point and 20year issues 
advanced about point according to figures provided by telerate 
inc a business information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer rose 208 to 113672 
moodys investment grade corporate bond index which measures 
price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years

sixmonth bills slipped 1 basis point to a discounted rate of 712 
percent and a yield of 748 percent while oneyear bills fell 6 
basis points to 733 percent to yield 786 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the

stocks and bonds strengthened sharply friday in rallies stemming 
partly from the dollars appreciation against foreign currencies 
counteracting fear of higher inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 4640 points 
to 212873 the largest oneday advance since a 4836point gain 
june 8 broader market barometers also rose strongly 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of the economy the 
treasurys key 30year issue rose more than 3 per 1000 face 
amount its yield which moves inversely to price fell to 921 
percent from 926 percent late thursday 
market economists attributed part of the advances to a jump in 
the dollars value in foreign exchange trading which increases 
overseas demand for securities denominated in dollars and lessens 
the prospect of sharply higher domestic inflation a constant 
source of concern to investors 
the us currency gained more than a west german pfennig to 
187985 marks and nearly a half japanese yen to 133145 yen the 
gains came despite centralbank dollar selling to slow its 
appreciating value 
in other economic news friday the agriculture department said 
the prices farmers received for raw products this month rose 36 
percent from june reflecting the droughts devastating effect on 
crop and livestock production 
the departments said higher prices for corn soybeans and eggs 
contributed most to the july increase lower prices for oranges 
cattle and hogs partly offset the rise in other commodities 
department projections earlier this month showed 1988 grain 
production may be reduced by 24 percent from last year heat and 
drought have dried pastures and forced producers to thin herds to 
cut down on rising feed costs

television is teaching britons to love the once 
littleknown sport of football and american sporting goods 
companies are cashing in on a craze for everything from uniforms to 
tshirts badges and fluffy toys bearing nfl team logos 
the market here is a sixyearold market said andrew 
maconie whose company licensing management international handles 
licensing publishing and marketing for the national football 
league in britain it was created with television 
britains channel 4 television began broadcasting weekly 
highlights of nfl games in 1982 calling the program american 
football to distinguish it from soccer called simply 
football here audiences have tripled to around 3 million 
viewers each week the tv stations studies say 
many british fans have gone beyond armchairquarterbacking more 
than 100 teams have sprung up in the country a league has been 
formed sponsored by budweiser beer and several magazines dedicated 
to the imported sport are being published 
as the game has caught on sales of american football 
paraphernalia have taken off 
last year maconie sold more than 43 million worth of 
nfllicensed products a 15 percent increase over the previous 
year he expects a similar climb this year 
we started with zero in 1982 so weve obviously had some very 
dramatic growth said maconie who worked to put football on tv 
here 
the growth has attracted some of the top names in american 
sporting goods to britain they have been helped by the us 
embassy which staged an american football equipment exhibition 
to coincide with a preseason nfl game sunday at londons wembley 
stadium between the miami dolphins and san francisco 49ers dubbed 
the american bowl 
the british market for football items is here to stay theres 
no question about that said tom knight general manager of all 
american import co which distributes products made by st 
louisbased rawlings sporting goods 
standing at his booth decorated with samples of team shirts 
footballs and shoulderpads knight said sales of playing equipment 
have leveled off as the sport has become more established 
but he said sales of souvenirtype items especially to 
youngsters is a side of the business which has been very big 
they having seen their fathers and big brothers play now 
want to play themselves that market can develop well knight 
said 
chris bye an official with the thames valley chargers a team 
in the budweiser league was hoping to find a good deal on helmets 
at the trade fair 
each player takes 300 pounds about 500 or more to kit each 
year he said you have a squad of 50 players thats a lot of 
money 
bye added that he was hoping to find higher quality goods for 
his team 
i believe that the existing stuff marketed to the general 
public in england at the moment isnt of high enough quality bye 
said the stuff in the states is very good we could sell some of 
that over here 
teddy craze whose fast lane sports distributes for champion 
products of rochester ny says his sales of uniforms and various 
nfllicensed items have gone up by 300 percent in one year 
theres really a good hard core of fans hungry for 
americanmade football goods he said and this is really 
developing very strongly 
another british firm woolgrove american imports recently began 
distributing products made by wilson sporting goods of river grove 
ill 
product manager doug proctor his sales booth crammed with 
wilson footballs and other football paraphernalia agreed that the 
televised nfl highlights created a market that did not exist before 
he said the nfl preseason contests staged at wembley the past 
three summers also have sparked a lot of interest and sales 
i think its probably the best marketing system we have in 
fact to have the top teams coming over here and showing how the 
game is properly played proctor said and its a big spinoff 
in the market
