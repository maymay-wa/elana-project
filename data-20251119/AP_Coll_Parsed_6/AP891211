more than a halfcentury after 
fleeing the nazis 81yearold nina rubinstein on monday received 
her doctorate in sociology at frankfurt university 
its the last thing i expected in my life said miss 
rubinstein of new york im elated im proud im surprised 
the dean of frankfurts johann wolfgang goethe universitys 
sociology department lothar brock said miss rubinstein was 
awarded the degree magna cum laude 
it was a big surprise for the retired united nations 
interpreter who was 25 when she fled the nazis in 1933 leaving 
behind her completed 247page thesis for her doctorate 
she first fled to france and then to the united states when 
hitlers troops marched on france 
im not particularly proud of myself in general but i thought 
the dissertation was rather good miss rubinstein said it was 
delivered in german 
but frankly i did not expect a magna cum laude that was a 
very enormous surprise she said chuckling 
miss rubinstein arrived in west germany last week to take part 
in a colloquium friday part of 75th anniversary celebrations at 
the universtiys social sciences department 
im absolutely shattered i think i never have been so 
exhausted not only physically but psychologically too after that 
day on friday the softspoken miss rubinstein said 
as part of the colloquium miss rubinstein read several poems 
taking an active part in the ceremonies said professor david 
kettler who was instrumental in arranging for her to get the 
degree 
kettler of trent university in peterborough ontario said it 
took him a year along with miss rubinsteins halfsister hanna 
papanek to make arrangements for awarding the doctorate 
it was like one of those ideas you suddenly have in the 
shower kettler said this is the university facing up to its 
responsibility to its students and faculty she did the work and 
deserves to be recognized for it 
miss rubinstein was born in berlin in 1908 to parents of jewish 
descent who fled their native latvia as political exiles after the 
failed russian revolution of 1905 
she lived in neutral denmark from 1914 through 1917 where she 
had fled with her mother to avoid world war i 
later she returned to germany to study and in 1928 began 
working toward her degree under the noted sociology professor karl 
mannheim 
miss rubinstein recalled how she enjoyed being in mannheims 
presence and how the students used to meet him at cafe laumer in 
the university area of frankfurts bockenheim district 
we very often met there with mannheim of course all the 
young ladies there adored him he was extremely attractive ive 
never forgotten that she said 
miss rubinstein then pointed out photographs showing herself 
and other students reading and chatting at the cafe with mannheim 
taken between 1930 and 1933 
he went to england right away after the nazis came miss 
rubinstein said i never saw him again i lost contact with him 
mannheim who last worked at the london school of economics had 
published dozens of manuscripts on sociology including man and 
society in an age of reconstruction in 1935 he died in england 
in 1947 
miss rubinstein said she was ready to defend her thesis titled 
the french emigration after 1789 a contribution to the 
sociology of political emigration when the nazis took over 
frankfurt university in 1933 
she said a nazi student retrieved her thesis which she left 
behind on a desk in the university before she fled to paris 
in paris she worked as a translator and secretary for a literary 
agency but fled again in 1940 when the nazis invaded france 
leaving everything behind including her thesis 
a french neighbor kept miss rubinsteins belongings and after 
the war traced her to new york and sent the thesis to her she said 
miss rubinstein who worked as a simultaneous translator 
mostly in russian for the united nations shelved the thesis 
for years until her halfsister ms papanek a research professor 
of anthropology at boston university began trying to get it 
published 
later efforts by ms papanek kettler and frankfurt 
universitys brock and professor claudia honegger arranged for 
miss rubinstein to finally receive her degree 
miss rubinstein said she will return to new york thursday 
im incredibly tired and i have the feeling when i come back 
to new york im going to go to bed and stay there for a couple of 
days she said

a mob informant and his rhode island 
police guards developed such a loose relationship over 3 years 
that they frolicked in florida together and sold vehicles to each 
other even though the protected witness was serving a prison term 
and security was so lax that anybody looking for informant peter 
gilbert a prized witness who traveled to court surrounded by 
police sharpshooters had only to look in rhode island auto title 
applications to find the address of his supposedly secret hideaway 
his widow debra and her lawyer also alleged in recent 
interviews at her florida home that police told mrs gilbert to 
turn in phony receipts for gilberts expenses 
a rhode island attorney generals report also said gilbert 
serving a 10year prison term for murder at the time he was a 
protected witness illegally had guns and improperly collected 
welfare and often was allowed to roam freely he frequently was 
ferried to florida with his guards some of whom allegedly brought 
their girlfriends 
it was just as if they were a bunch of fraternity guys 
skydiving drinking women said thomas hogan jr mrs gilberts 
attorney 
mrs gilberts revelations are the latest about her husbands 
custody that have surfaced since he died june 11 1988 they 
flabbergast the man who founded the federal witness protection 
program 
our prime goal is to keep him alive to keep him in the right 
frame of mind to testify said john partington a former us 
marshal recently named providence ri public safety commissioner 
gilbert 43 died of a heart attack while on an unsupervised 
skydiving trip to connecticut the attorney generals report later 
acknowledged police knew he had a history of heart problems police 
found cocaine in his car 
rhode island state police are investigating but previous 
reports by the attorney general and the providence journalbulletin 
showed the state spent as much as 169000 on gilbert and his wife 
during his 3 years in police custody purchases included bullets 
liquor jewelry concert tickets and 52 skydiving trips 
two of gilberts guards have committed suicide since his death 
and two were reassigned from the police intelligence unit to the 
uniform division former providence police chief anthony j 
mancuso who became the attorney generals chief drug enforcement 
officer while continuing to be paid by providence after stepping 
down as chief recently resigned from the attorney generals office 
and the force citing continued publicity about the gilbert case 
gilbert was supposed to be a key witness against six reputed 
mobsters but testified against only one before his death because 
he died charges against most of the others were dropped 
under an agreement with the attorney generals office gilbert 
lived at the providence police station from his arrest in february 
1985 until his transfer to a glocester ri safe house in january 
1988 mrs gilbert alternated between living in florida and with 
her husband in rhode island 
police and the attorney generals office refused to release the 
safe house address but it was listed on a march 1988 title 
application gilbert filed at the motor vehicle registry in 
connection with a car loan 
that is unbelievable partington said you dont have to 
be a police chief or security expert to say its unthinkable for 
gilberts address to be in public records 
gilbert paid detective jeffrey ward 3000 for a 13yearold 
harley davidson motorcycle in april 1988 according to sales tax 
documents provided by a source close to the investigation who 
demanded anonymity 
i know about a motorcycle said ward who declined to answer 
other questions 
providence and state police and the attorney generals office 
wont comment on the case mancuso who stepped down in 1988 
denied knowledge of any transactions between gilbert and his 
guards but would say no more 
mrs gilbert wont talk about many things because of the pending 
state police investigation but hogan said that among her other 
allegations are that 
gilbert sold a chrysler cordoba to police matron eva diaz in 
early 1986 no title could be found under either name and diaz 
referred questions to mrs gilbert diaz said she took over loan 
payments on gilberts 1984 buick after his death 
gilbert told his wife her sixthanniversary ring in 1987 was 
bought from ward who denies it 
police officers told her to get phony receipts to include with 
the ones submitted to the attorney general for gilberts expenses 
receipts the attorney generals report says often were not 
reviewed mrs gilbert says she never heeded the officers advice 
and wont name them 
mrs gilbert said her husband made at least a dozen statepaid 
trips to florida for family visits and to clear up outstanding 
charges including a prison break hogan said the guards often 
brought girlfriends 
hogan said the guards and women would stay in hotel rooms while 
gilbert would stay with his wife at her home more than a mile 
away it could not be determined who paid for the rooms or if the 
guards watched mrs gilberts house 
wpri televison in providence recently broadcast home videos of 
gilbert and his guards frolicking in florida and at a vacation home 
in narragansett ri 
one tape showed an officer with his arm around gilbert saying 
the criminal justice system has been very very good to us huh

masked men set off explosives that 
destroyed 80 apartments under construction in a tourist complex 
police said the separatist corsican national liberation front 
claimed responsibility 
police said two men wearing hoods tied up 11 people living at 
the site mostly construction workers and drove them to a village 
15 miles away before detonating the blast early monday in the 
apartment complex in calvi on the northwestern coast of this french 
mediterranean island 
no injuries were reported 
the corsican national liberation front claimed responsibility in 
a statement made public in the bastia the nearest major city 
saying it was fighting speculative enterprises which will lead 
eventually to the marginalization of our people on their own land 
a similar attack last month destroyed 135 apartments under 
construction at santa lucia di porto vecchio in southeastern

parallel to the revolution around 
it pragues 700yearold shrinking jewish community has staged its 
own tumultuous uprising and deposed old leaders who had 
accommodated the communists 
freedom might fire the dwindling band with fresh life the new 
leader said but even that may not be enough 
furor erupted when the council of jewish communities did not 
protest the police beating of student demonstrators nov 17 it was 
the only czechoslovak religious group to remain silent 
rabbi daniel mayer sent his own letter decrying brutality and 
arrogance then threatened to quit if bohumil heller and 
frantisek kraus did not relinquish command of the council 
young jews already had criticized the two in another letter 
for what they described as sacrificing principles to appease 
authorities 
in a noisy open meeting sunday prague jews reinstated desider 
galsky a 68yearold historian who was council president until 
czechoslovak authorities forced him out in 1985 
everyone is watching me now galsky said but i cannot 
create a heaven in 24 hours these will be difficult times 
his main concern is that simple attrition will accomplish what 
adolf hitler could not turn pragues 13th century oldnew 
synagogue into a museum 
the nazis found 47000 jews in prague and killed most of them 
but spared the medieval jewish quarter with its relics and 
documents as a museum of deviant culture 
jews returned after the war but more than 1000 are on 
community rolls fewer than 2000 others live in the city and 
threequarters are over 65 about 10000 jews live elsewhere in 
czechoslovakia 
for every 20 who die two or three others join said mayer 
we are very worried about the numbers 
asked whether new freedoms in czechoslovakia would help the 
jews he replied without a pause no 
mayer said the government council on religious affairs probably 
would end its subsidies and the community would find it hard to 
survive jewish leaders accept the money on grounds the state 
seized priceless objects in the 1950s and never paid compensation 
pressed on the subject mayer chuckled and added on balance 
i suppose id rather have freedom 
galsky said he was negotiating to keep the annual stipend 
equivalent to about 30000 but only if other religious groups 
retained theirs 
we hope that jews around the world will help us he said 
money aside many prague jews think a more open czechoslovakia 
will bring out jews who once feared praying in public 
i think things will be better said vida neuwirthova a 
27yearold puppeteer who runs a jewish childrens troupe and works 
with the jewish choir we badly need young people 
her choir has emerged from years in which authorities would not 
let it perform in public because choir members refused to exclude 
the wife of ivan klima a dissident writer whose works were banned 
until recently 
ms neuwirthova knows it will be an uphill fight she has yet to 
persuade her husband who is not a jew to allow a bar mitzvah when 
their 2yearold is 13 
he does not want his son to be different she said 
bar mitzvahs average one every two years but galsky plans to 
encourage foreign jews to come to prague for bar mitzvahs and 
weddings in what he calls the oldest continuous jewish congregation 
in europe 
saturday morning services are in a narrow vaulted room off the 
locked main temple a dozen old men in shawls murmur hebrew 
sitting at a kitchen table whose plastic cover is patterned with 
gaily colored animals 
much livelier is the communitys kosher restaurant in the 
building next door not to be confused with the nearby old 
synagogue restaurant which serves roast pork and dumplings 
tourists normally outnumber jews in the cobbled streets that 
wind among houses built centuries ago by merchants and 
intellectuals two old synagogues are museums containing 300000 
of the silver ornaments prayer shawls and documents hitler planned 
to display 
at the old jewish cemetery visitors thread their way among 
broken stone tombs where people were buried up to nine deep to save 
precious space 
only for holidays and in times of crisis do prague jews come 
out in force and the question is how long there will be enough 
who knows reflected galsky in 10 years we might still 
be all right but in 20 
at the open meeting jiri radvansky a 33yearold pediatrician 
who reads no hebrew and wears no yarmulke drew loud applause for a 
tonguelashing 
he said he joined the community as a child to be among other 
jews and was distressed to see people leave it over the years 
because of internal squabbles clearly he was unhappy about 
compromises made with communism 
radvansky excoriated jews who fight among themselves as their 
numbers dwindle and proposed a group for people interested in 
jewish culture whatever their own religion 
we must stop this stupid bickering and protect our heritage 
he said otherwise we will disappear

artists and intellectuals in taiwan are 
excavating the dark past of the nationalist government sparking a 
cultural boom in this economic powerhouse 
movies court cases a radio drama and the recent election 
campaign have created a flood of pressure on this island of 20 
million to confront its past 
the boom has also given voice to native taiwanese who make up 
85 percent of the population but have had scant political influence 
since 1949 when the nationalist party seized power after losing a 
civil war to the communists on mainland china 
we are awakening after a long sleep says antonio chiang 
editor of the prestigious journalist magazine we are finally 
learning who we are where we came from 
taiwanese have always regarded their rocky island as the 
orphan of asia as a popular song goes since the 17th century 
they have been ruled by spaniards dutch japanese and chinese from 
the mainland 
when the nationalists took power they imposed the culture of 
the mainland on the little island mandarin chinese replaced 
taiwanese dialect in the classroom and students were fined if they 
spoke the local patois taiwanese history was dominated by chinese 
history 
only fools or gangsters spoke taiwanese on tv 
i dont know how many times my teacher made me stand with a 
board around my neck saying ill never speak taiwanese again 
said chen shuipien a leading opposition politician the 
mainlanders made us feel like taiwanese natives were secondclass 
citizens 
a change came in 1987 when thenpresident chiang chingkuo ended 
38 years of martial law taiwans astounding economic growth had 
created an increasingly sophisticated population which no longer 
tolerated harsh political repression 
the government relaxed its tight controls on the press 
legalized opposition political parties and began tolerating some 
dissent 
a further boon to the cultural boom came in june when communist 
chinese troops in beijing crushed a prodemocracy movement the 
tragedy in tiananmen square sparked taiwanese to probe nationalist 
abuses 
in october city of sorrow an awardwinning film opened in 
taiwan to packed houses the movie was the first to explore the 
feb 28 1947 massacre when nationalist troops slaughtered tens of 
thousands of taiwanese after clashes between island natives and 
mainland immigrants 
a deafmute plays the central role and witnesses the horrors a 
powerful metaphor for taiwans silenced intellectuals 
in its portrayal of a gangster clan the movie probes the 
politically sensitive question of organized crimes influence over 
politics ironically the film is reported to be backed by gangland 
money 
a wildypopular radio drama also has its roots in taiwans past 
the japanese occupation from 18951945 liao tienting is 
taiwans robin hood who robs japanese imperialists and gives to 
the poor 
the show draws thinly veiled parallels between japans 
occupation and nationalist government domination in taiwan its 
announcer has entered politics and is a strong supporter of the 
opposition democratic progressive party 
taiwans recent election campaign the first multiparty race in 
its history also made use of the past and taiwanese culture 
one successful candidate for the legislature yeh chulan 
advocated independence from china a seditious act under the 
constitution her victory gave voice to an undercurrent of support 
especially among native taiwanese for cutting all ties with 
beijing 
taiwanese folk songs filled the air at her rallies a guerrilla 
theater troupe acted out scenes of alleged nationalist brutality 
the 1947 killings and the death of yehs husband a dissident who 
immolated himself in april to escape police interrogation 
the troupe also portrayed scenes from a 1979 riot in the 
southern city of kaohsiung 
on dec 10 1979 tens of thousands of people demonstrated in 
kaohsiung for human rights and hundreds were injured in a brawl 
the government rounded up more than 150 dissidents and dozens were 
sentenced to long jail terms 
a celebrated court case has also returned attention to the 
bloody clash in september fugitive dissident hsu hsinliang 
wanted for allegedly fomenting the riot was arrested as he tried 
to slip into taiwan on a fishing boat 
hsus case sparked exposes in the increasingly free press 
in october the journalist claimed police used torture and 
intimidation to extract confessions of participants in the riot 
other reports have called for an investigation of the killings of 
the wife and daughter of one of the kaohsiung dissidents lin 
yihsiung jailed after the clash 
the government should have forgetten the case and welcomed hsu 
back said opposition figure chen also hsus attorney 
instead they were too worried about losing face so theyre 
prosecuting him that has opened up this old wound and the 
opposition is profiting from the controversy 
some intellectuals oppose this use of taiwans history and 
culture as a political weapon 
hou hsiaohsien who directed city of sorrow says he made 
the movie to return history to the people 
the nationalists and the opposition are using the february 28 
incident like a trump card he said in a recent interview the 
movie was my way of butting into their card game and turning the 
trump card over february 28 is our history it doesnt belong to 
political parties 
president lee tenghui the countrys first native taiwanese 
leader has asked his people to forget about the ugly past and look 
to the future 
but hou counters if we dont talk about it now we are 
doomed to repeat it

federal bureaucrats and private insurers are 
scrambling to rework health insurance benefits adjust premiums and 
spread the word that the end is near for medicares yearold 
catastrophic health care program 
in addition millions of senior citizens are refiguring their 
expected 1989 tax bills the internal revenue service is scrapping 
form 8808 before it hits the printing press and states are trying 
to figure out how they will cover an extra 300 million to 400 
million in health care expenses for the poor 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act expected to cost 48 
billion in its first five years was enacted with fanfare in 1988 
to protect 33 million elderly and disabled people against financial 
ruin from the staggering costs of prolonged illness 
but even before most of the benefits took effect congress voted 
last month to dismantle the program because of a firestorm of 
protest from senior citizens who complained it cost them too much 
president bush has promised to sign the repeal measure 
under repeal the health care financing administration must take 
back the extended hospitalization and nursing home coverage it has 
offered medicare beneficiaries for the past year and scrap plans to 
provide expanded coverage of drug and doctor bills and other 
medical expenses 
louis b hays the acting hcfa administrator said a top 
priority for the agency is to get notices out to medicare 
beneficiaries explaining the new limits on their hospital and 
nursing home benefits 
we want to make sure that there isnt confusion hays said 
the agency also can forget about providing additional medical 
benefits that we had invested enormous energy and time in 
preparing to implement he said 
the irs and the social security administration meanwhile have 
the tasks of rolling back the income tax surcharge on the elderly 
and the extra medicare premium that financed the catastrophic 
program the surtax was canceled completely the extra premium will 
be scrapped at the end of the year 
irs spokesman henry holmes said taxpayers will be instructed to 
ignore two lines on this years 1040 tax forms lines 54 and 55 
which refer senior citizens to the elusive form 8808 that never got 
beyond the prototype stage 
higherincome senior citizens would have used 8808 to calculate 
their added income tax liability for the medicare benefits senior 
citizens who paid extra amounts in quarterly income tax payments or 
through wage withholding to cover the medicare surtax will get any 
overpayments back as part of their income tax refund holmes said 
about 40 percent of the elderly would have paid some surtax 
2250 for every 150 of federal income tax liability with about 
6 percent paying the maximum amount of 800 per person this year 
scrapping the tax is the type of lastminute change it is easy 
to spring on taxpayers holmes said 
everybody enjoys hearing news that they dont have to pay a 
tax that was on the books he said 
the social security administration meanwhile is complaining 
that congress did not give the agency enough lead time to stop 
withholding extra medicare premiums that helped finance the 
catastrophic benefits it may be april or may before extra payments 
of about 530 a month no longer are deducted from social security 
checks with the overpayments to be refunded later the premiums of 
4 a month during 1989 will not be refunded 
the bottom line is that social security will unscramble this 
egg but we did not lay it said social security commissioner 
gwendolyn king 
the repeal also is causing lastminute maneuvering among private 
insurers who will pick up some of the benefits being canned by the 
government about 70 percent of elderly americans purchase private 
medigap insurance to fill the gaps in their medicare coverage 
the national association of insurance commissioners has until 
dec 15 to draft transition regulations for medigap policies and 
private insurers have until jan 30 to revise their policies and 
premiums and notify policyholders of the changes any changes 
however will be retroactive to jan 1 when the government 
benefits expire 
insurance companies are doing their best theyre just 
grumbling about how long it took congress to make up their mind 
said alan richards of the health insurance association of america 
its kind of a well muddle through situation we just hope 
congress doesnt change their mind again next year 
the association has estimated medigap premiums will rise 20 
percent to 25 percent next year due to the combined effects of 
rising medical costs and the repeal of the catastrophic package 
fallout from the repeal also is reaching state governments the 
repeal legislation left in place expanded medicaid costs for the 
states while scrapping provisions that would have offset some of 
the new expenses said alicia pelrine of the national governors 
association 
grumbling is probably a tame word to describe what is going on 
out there ms pelrine said states are already so maxed out on 
their ability to accommodate various federal mandates that a 
lot are saying we dont know how were going to pay for this 
gerald miller executive director of the national association of 
state budget officers said the original catastrophic legislation 
would have cost states 900 million but the repeal bill boosts 
those costs by an additional 300 million to 400 million

from discos to dormitories and hotels 
authorities are stepping up moves to limit foreigners contacts 
with chinese 
black sedans without license plates and full of security men 
have been parked outside the us embassy recently plainclothes 
police and surveillance cameras are being increased elsewhere to 
keep track of whos meeting whom 
police are cracking down on chinese girls who meet with 
foreigners said a clothing saleswoman who is obliged to attend 
meetings where workers denounce american imperialism 
it doesnt matter if youre just friends or colleagues 
theyll just assume the girls a prostitute she said 
the steppedup monitoring comes amid a crackdown on 
prostitution increased warnings about aids and general wariness of 
associating with foreigners since the military crackdown on 
prodemocracy protesters in beijing in june 
the chinese government claims the june turmoil was instigated 
with foreign help 
in november the culture ministry canceled a planned exhibition 
at the french embassy of a chinese painter and this month police 
halted plans by the foreign correspondents club of beijing to show 
works by six chinese artists 
western diplomats and journalists have been turned down for 
routine interviews and meetings by numerous government ministries 
and think tanks a wellknown english corner in a public park 
where people gathered on sundays to practice english also has been 
banned 
diplomats and foreign journalists have long lived in special 
compounds with armed guards and surveillance cameras entering 
taxis are checked for chinese who are supposed to be screened by 
the guards 
a year ago large cameras were installed at the compounds main 
entrances and inside elevators reporters who inquired about the

in a vast sea of arms outstretched 
in victory zdenek machon joined in singing the national anthem 
but choking on emotion he could barely get out the words 
i can look people directly in the eye now people from other 
countries he said we are a free people again we are part of 
europe again 
machon was among 100000 czechoslovaks who on sunday returned to 
wenceslas square where only three weeks ago they first gathered to 
tell the communist party that after 41 years enough was enough 
on sunday they celebrated the naming of the first noncommunist 
dominated government since 1948 
he is a big man with a thick mustache but he showed no 
embarrassment at the tears trickling down his face it was the 
students who first rose up and machon has three in his family 
i am so thankful to my children for setting us free he 
said and i am so happy that they can now live their lives in 
freedom 
from the towering statue of king wenceslas on horseback to the 
gates of pragues medieval old town the distance of eight football 
fields end to end czechoslovaks shared the same thoughts 
there were speeches and chants but their message was all in 
their moist red eyes 
you have to understand how we felt in 1968 said machon now 
47 we had one child then and now we have three life will be 
different now 
in 1968 a soviet invasion brought an abrupt halt to the 
czechoslovaks last try for freedom the peoples only weapon were 
the v signs they aimed at the tanks 
the next morning the communist party daily rude pravo carried 
a picture of resisting crowds with each person holding up two 
fingers the caption said they were threatening to attack socialist 
troops in two minutes 
this time there was no confusion over the v victory sign 
at the first strains of the national anthem machons two thick 
fingers were joined by 200000 others 
at every chant he leaned over to translate for a foreign 
reporter eager that the world not miss any part of 
czechoslovakias triumph his wife beamed and nodded happily 
how can i explain what this means said machon who is a 
geophysicist when i went abroad to meetings i could not look at 
people we were different inferior ashamed 
when a frenchwoman spoke from the fourthfloor balcony 
delivering a message of support from european theater groups he 
glowed after she finished the crowd chanted merci merci 
the setting said as much as machons explanation 
throughout four decades of communist party rule czechoslovaks 
spoke in private of whom they were and what they would be again 
someday 
machon knew sunday was that day 
with the crowd he chanted we want havel demanding the 
nowvacant presidency for vaclav havel the playwright who spent 
four of the last 20 years in prison for insisting on exposing the 
hypocrisy and brutality of communist rule 
as with masaryk and others after him czechoslovaks in crisis 
rallied to a man of letters rather than a politician 
it is a wonderful day wonderful machon said how can i 
say it instead of trying he hugged the reporter and wept again

bison that blunder over the line from 
yellowstone national park are fair game for hunters again this 
winter but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller than 
the 500 taken last season 
just how many of the big furry dumb beasts will wander outside 
the park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter is 
and how pinched the food supply within the park officials say 
hunters arent allowed to shoot buffalo in the park 
but statements by a leading zoologist have added weight to the 
states contention that the slaughter of wandering bison is 
necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis among montana cattle 
herds despite the outrage such killings may produce 
dr don davis a texas aampm university specialist in the highly 
infectious bacterial disease said previous claims by park 
officials that the bison bug could not be transmitted to cattle 
have proven false 
montana has spent in excess of 260 million of federal and 
state money to rid the domestic livestock of brucellosis davis 
said so you can see why youre not real crazy to get it back 
again 
davis scientific adviser to a committee on brucellosis in 
montana wyoming and idaho said the national park service could do 
more to eradicate brucellosis in the yellowstone herds by isolating 
and slaughtering infected bison 
but that would mean killing the animals on park property and 
that isnt going to happen he said 
were talking bigtime political and economic concessions if 
they were to do that davis said 
the park service says that unless scientists can prove 
brucellosis was not in the park when yellowstone was created in 
1872 it may classify the bacteria as a native species park 
policy forbids eradication of any native species 
eradicating brucellosis from the buffalo herd could prove 
useless if the organism is native to the area and simply reinfects 
the animals said yellowstone spokeswoman joan anzelmo and the 
buffalo would no longer be a wild freeroaming species if they 
were treated like domestic cattle she said 
brucellosis also called bangs disease causes domestic cattle 
to lose their calves it can cause undulant fever characterized 
by recurring fever and aching joints in humans who get it through 
unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals it 
generally cant be transmitted through meat 
the us agriculture department has been trying for decades to 
eliminate the disease from commercial herds so far usda says 27 
states are free of brucellosis with the disease most prevalent in 
the south brucellosis was eradicated from montana cattle in 1984 
last year due to food shortages caused by the massive 1988 
forest fires and an ensuing harsh winter hundreds of hungry bison 
wandered north onto montana cattle ranches 
hunters were called in to snag strays and a record 569 bison 
were killed of these about half were found to be infected with 
brucellosis park officials counted 418 buffalo in the northern 
herd last week and estimate a park total of about 2000 animals in 
the parks three major herds 
wyoming where most of yellowstone is located does not permit 
the shooting of stray bison 
animal rights activists sought unsuccessfully to stop last 
years hunt which to some was sadly reminiscent of the massive 
buffalo slaughter of a century ago that signalled the final taming 
of the wild west 
although the bison season legally began oct 1 it does not 
actually start until and unless bison begin leaving the park that 
usually happens in december although it may not happen at all if 
the winter is mild 
the biologists cant predict whether theyll move as they did 
last year anzelmo said we hope not maybe only a few will 
leave the park 
previously officials have said they expect no more than 200 to 
be harvested this year 
in preparation for the hunt 3217 people have paid 5 to apply 
for a bison permit if summoned by the wildlife department to hunt 
montanans pay 200 for a license while nonresidents pay 1000 
the hunt itself is less than thrilling buffalo are accustomed 
to seeing humans and game wardens lead each hunter directly to the 
animal to be killed the hunters shoot at close range at animals 
that often are standing still grazing

three men who held the most powerful 
jobs in the west virginia senate face stiff prison terms and fines 
this week after being snared in a corruption investigation that 
swept through the legislature 
former senate president larry tucker and former majority leader 
si boettner go before us district judge john t copenhaver jr on 
wednesday former senate president dan tonkovich faces sentencing 
thursday 
the three all democrats are the latest west virginia public 
officials to fall to investigations by us attorney mike carey 
carey 35 also has nailed a house of delegates member a top 
senate aide and two lobbyists on various corruption charges and he 
obtained an indictment of a charlestonarea dog track owner who 
allegedly fed some of the corruption with dollars bet at the track 
west virginia already was reeling from two forced resignations 
this summer treasurer a james manchin stepped down to avoid a 
state senate trial on articles of impeachment after he was 
disgraced over the loss of 279 million in a state investment fund 
attorney general charlie brown quit after conceding he changed his 
testimony during child custody proceedings 
carey says his work isnt over yet but he repeatedly has 
declined to elaborate 
these cases do show the system is corruptible as are most 
systems of government carey said 
careys investigations have caused consternation in the 
statehouse where democrats outnumber republicans 304 in the 
senate and 8020 in the house 
senate president keith burdette has asked carey to conclude the 
investigation as soon as possible it makes my job tougher 
said burdette who at age 34 took over from tucker as senate 
president 
its undermined the publics confidence in state government 
burdette said he supports the investigations however 
i think its a necessary purge of that element of public 
officials in west virginia said house speaker chuck chambers 
tucker 54 who spent 18 years in the legislature before 
becoming senate president in 1988 resigned and pleaded guilty 
sept 11 to extorting 10000 from dog track interests he faces 
fines of 250000 and 20 years in prison 
tuckers plea briefly interrupted the extortion trial of 
tonkovich 43 senate president from 1984 to 1987 when he left the 
senate for an unsuccessful bid for governor tucker then became a 
prosecution witness against tonkovich 
tucker admitted that he had pocketed 10000 the scandal cost 
him a job as a bank executive vice president 
three days later tonkovich pleaded guilty to extorting 5000 
from casino gambling interests in return for help on a bill to 
legalize gaming the bill was not passed 
witnesses testified that tonkovichs aide bob cain had pressed 
them for campaign donations cain admitted being part of a 
laundering scheme to get 15000 in gaming money for tonkovich 
cain and track and insurance lobbyist bonnie wymer pleaded 
guilty to federal income tax charges and both testified against 
tonkovich cain and wymer were sentenced to probation thursday 
last december state delegate bob mccormick was convicted of 
extortion lobbyist john vandergrift revealed he paid money to 
mccormick for help on a bill and also said he lavished 160000 on 
the legislature in three years 
vandergrift lobbyist for a group of foreign doctors who sought 
to ease restrictions on their obtaining us medical licenses 
pleaded guilty to a federal income tax charge and spent less than 
six months in prison he admitted he had not filed income tax 
returns for 16 years 
boettner pleaded guilty sept 23 to federal charges of income 
tax evasion for taking money from the same lobbyist who paid off 
tucker boettner who faces 20 years in prison and fines of 
250000 also testified against tonkovich 
the lobbyist sam dannunzio committed suicide dec 4 1988 
police said 
facing a february trial is dog track owner bill ellis he is 
alleged to have paid 10000 to tucker and offered 13000 to 
tonkovich through dannunzio for help on a bill that increased his 
tracks take by 11 million

the bush administration plans to propose that 
generic drug companies pay user fees to help beef up government 
regulation of an industry reeling from a bribery and fraud scandal 
sources say 
the plan drafted by the food and drug administration would 
impose registration fees on generic drug makers and charge them 
another fee for each application they file said a source who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
the fees would raise about 18 million as part of a 144 million 
package of fda fees the administration plans to propose in its 
fiscal 1991 budget the source said 
the bush administration like the reagan administration favors 
user fees because they raise money without raising taxes plans to 
extend these fees to the drug industry have been proposed before 
only to be axed by opponents on capitol hill 
but this time a plan directed at the generic drug industry is 
believed to have better chances largely because of disclosures 
this year that some generic drug makers have bribed fda officials 
cheated on safety tests and otherwise sidestepped fda regulations 
there has been some hill concern about the ability of the fda 
to do its job said one source at the department of health and 
human services which includes fda i think youll find theyre 
more receptive to talking about fda user fees than talking about 
user fees in general 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee demonstrates some evidence of 
a shift in opinion his panel uncovered the problems that have led 
to the bribery convictions of several generic drug company 
executives and fda employees and the recall of more than 80 generic 
drugs 
dingell who has opposed user fees is increasingly coming to 
favor them for the generic drug industry as long as the money 
raised is used exclusively to strengthen the generic drug approval 
system said an aide to the congressman who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified by name 
the generic drug industry opposes the plan which would hit 
generic companies only not brand name drug makers with a 
registration fee of about 6000 on each company and another charge 
of about 17000 for each generic drug application they submit for 
fda review 
its like putting a tax on one side of the industry because of 
a couple of wrongdoers said dee fensterer president of the 
generic pharmaceutical industry association 
she said the fees could add up to a substantial amount of 
money especially if the companies had to pay the application fee 
for each dosage of the same product it starts to be very 
expensive 
she added that any user fee is going to get passed on to 
consumers in the form of a price increase though she could not say 
how much the fees might add to the cost of a generic drug she said 
it would not be large enough to make generics less competitive with 
the more expensive brand name products 
the makers of brand name products also oppose user fees even 
when the costs are imposed only on their competitors 
many say if the generic fees are approved it would only be a 
matter of time before a similar plan were imposed on the name brand 
companies 
in a letter to hhs secretary louis sullivan earlier this fall 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers association representing brand 
name makers said the fees are unjustified because they would 
constitute the collection of revenues for services performed for 
the benefit of the general public and not for the specific benefit 
of an applicant or registrant

cuts in defense spending wont hurt the 
economy analysts say but could be traumatic for a workforce 
accustomed to satisfying a single complacent customer the 
pentagon instead of the competitive marketplace 
a third of the nations engineers and scientists work in defense 
and by some estimates 26 million people depend on the military 
economy so theres considerable concern in washington about the 
recoil that will be felt the defense budget is sharply reduced as 
seems likely 
analyst william w kaufmann of harvard university and the 
brookings institution thinks defense spending could be half its 
current size in 10 years 
both the new era opened by president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev at malta and the pressures of the deficit 
point to dismantling the reagan era defense buildup john ruby 
chief operating officer of ford aerospace says a number of firms 
are already planning downsizing 
some economists say the government also should be designing 
retraining counseling job search and relocation programs to ease 
the transition for defense workers 
we put over a billion and a half dollars into building planes 
we didnt need to preserve jobs says lawrence j korb who was 
an assistant defense secretary in the reagan administration 
id like to see the government come up with a plan to help 
people in a graceful and humane way but you talk about an 
industrial policy in this country and they call you a communist 
he says 
congress joint economic committee is looking at the issue it 
has scheduled hearings for tuesday on the economic consequences 
of reduced defense spending and the winding down of the cold war 
depending on its size and speed a substantial cut in defense 
spending phased in over a number of years could be one of the best 
things that could happen to the economy and should not be looked on 
as something likely to cause recession or unemployment says 
charles schultze who was president carters chief economic adviser 
one thing this country does not have is a surplus of is 
skilled engineers and skilled workmen 
but conversion of defense workers technicians managers and 
plants to the civilian economy will be trickier than it was after 
world war ii when detroit stopped making tanks and resumed making 
desoto automobiles without missing a step there was enormous 
pentup demand for civilian products too 
but government planners cite societys needs for environmental 
cleanup recycling of plastics health care which may be able to 
adopt defense industry technology 
i hope trade associations will see the relationship between a 
mayor who is worried about defense cuts in his community and about 
waste management if youre smart you can walk in and say i can 
solve them both at once says john tepper marlin of the council 
on economic priorities 
defense managers have grown accustomed to working in the 
hothouse environment of pentagon contracting with no competition 
from overseas a single cooperative customer and costplusprofit 
accounting 
defense contractors are used to being told what the market 
is says consultant jacques gansler author of affording 
defense and a pentagon procurement official in 197277 the 
commercial world isnt like that 
but seymour melman retired professor of industrial engineering 
at columbia university and a pioneer advocate of planned 
conversion rejects the view that the economy can absorb defense 
budget cuts without severe dislocations 
he argues for an elaborate government efforts to prepare defense 
workers and to create productive civilian jobs for them 
what are they going to work at he demands making shoes 
eightfive percent of our shoes are imported consumer electronics 
all imported machine tools half are imported 
moreover melman argues defense managers are incapable of 
making the leap without retraining 
no major militaryserving enterprise has demonstrated an 
autonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switch 
that is needed to go civilian melman wrote in his book 
profits without production 
if you unleash these people the us will turn into a 
thirdrate economy melman says they cant hack it we will 
lose the capability of repairing the damage 
under a conversion legislation sponsored by rep ted weiss 
dny defense contractors would be required to put 125 percent 
of receipts into a fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment 
laidoff workers might get 90 percent of their lost salaries while 
they are retrained for civilian jobs 
gordon adams director of the defense budget project a 
washingon research outfit says workers find work when the 
economy is healthy you can plan the dickens out of what to do with 
a worker but when were in a recession you cant do anything for 
him 
adams says although counseling retraining and relocation 
programs are critical income supplements however slow the 
adjustment process

nicaragua proposed at a gathering of 
central american presidents sunday that un observers in the 
region be given new powers and personnel to start disbanding the 
usbacked contra rebels a nicaraguan source said 
but after the summits first day the nicaraguans were no closer 
to getting agreement on their proposal 
nothing has been done foreign minister miguel descoto of 
nicaragua told reporters after the days session had ended 
the demobilization of the contras must be complied with he 
said the united nations must begin to function in nicaragua 
also sunday the salvadoran government rejected a truce proposed 
by leftist rebels fighting in that country 
in return for demobilization of the contras the nicaraguan 
government would consider resuming its ceasefire and technical 
talks with the leadership of the hondurasbased rebels said a 
nicaraguan source after the opening of the twoday summit 
the source close to the nicaraguan delegation who refused to be 
identified also said nicaragua was willing to allow the un group 
to verify that no weapons are sent from nicaragua to el salvadors 
leftist rebels 
the un observers were approved four months ago to monitor the 
voluntary repatriation of the contras and make sure that one 
countrys territory was not being used to launch attacks on a 
neighbor 
the source however said the nicaraguan government was not 
optimistic about acceptance of the proposal in view of the united 
states bipartisan decision to keep the contras alive until after 
the february elections in nicaragua 
nicaragua canceled its ceasefire with the contras on nov 1 
accusing them of disrupting registration for the feb 25 elections 
also at sundays opening session the salvadoran government 
rejected a ceasefire proposal by the leftist rebels of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
the rebels asked for the dismissal of seven highranking 
military leaders in el salvador and full respect for human rights 
and democratic liberties of political and social organizations 
the salvadoran government instead asked the rebels to make a 
commitment not to launch attacks in urban areas and offered to 
resume negotiations in venezuela 
costa rica proposed a truce in el salvador from dec 12 through 
jan 15 to give the fmln and the government time to begin 
negotiations for a permanent ceasefire costa rica also proposed 
that the united nations be given powers to verify such a ceasefire 
in el salvador 
the five central american presidents opened their meeting in an 
atmosphere of frustration and pessimism hoping the superpowers 
would help rescue the flagging peace efforts in the region 
we must face that reality that the superpowers help is 
needed said costa rican foreign minister rodrigo madrigal who 
commented on the presidents discussions he added that regional 
agreements will not have much validity in those places where 
parties in the conflicts have close ties to the united states and 
the soviet union 
attending the summit are presidents oscar arias of costa rica 
alfredo cristiani of el salvador vinicio cerezo of guatemala jose 
azcona hoyo of honduras and daniel ortega of nicaragua 
the presidents met briefly in a conference room listened to a 
welcoming speech by costa rican information minister jorge urbina 
and then went into a private session 
arias on saturday had called the superpowers without naming the 
united states and soviet union twofaced he said they spoke 
about political solutions while encouraging military activities 
we must demand from them a definition of their roles what 
they have done themselves or through other countries to exert a 
negative or positive influence in the region madrigal said 
he did not suggest how the superpowers might respond but one 
source speaking with the condition of anonymity said the two 
might send representatives or observers to negotiations between the 
warring parties 
the united states supports the nicaraguan rebels fighting the 
leftist sandinista government it also backs el salvador in its 
civil war against leftist insurgents washington accuses the soviet 
union and cuba of providing arms and aid to nicaragua and the 
salvadoran rebels 
this summit had been scheduled to be held in nicaragua but it 
was changed to san jose when el salvador suspended relations with 
nicaragua last month 
el salvador took the action after two small planes were found in 
el salvador carrying surfacetoair rockets that cristiani said 
were being flown from nicaragua to the fmln one plane crashed and 
the other was burned at a rural airstrip 
agreements reached at an august summit in tela honduras called 
for the nicaraguan contra rebels to disband by dec 5 however 
their forces headquartered in camps in honduras have remained in 
place

paint branch elementary school under 
court order to desegregate became a magnet school 2 years ago and 
attracted so many affluent children that it lost its federal funds 
to help the disadvantaged members of its original student body 
in solving one problem the magnet system created another how 
to retain services in the face of lost funds under the federal 
chapter one program which provides money for extra teachers and 
supplies to qualifying schools 
it is a predicament experienced by magnet schools around the 
country including many of the 44 here in prince georges county 
outside washington dc 
magnet schools provide specialized instruction in math science 
foreign languages and other areas the idea has been pushed by 
administrators as a way to desegregate by attracting students 
voluntarily to schools away from their homes 
president bush is pushing to expand the concept nationwide as 
part of his effort to improve learning in america 
as of august the education department awarded 54 grants 
totaling 1136 million for magnet programs in 25 states this 
compares with 38 federal grants totaling 75 million two years ago 
education undersecretary ted sanders acknowledged that some 
magnet schools are losing chapter one funds but insisted the 
problem is not widespread he said there are no immediate plans to 
revise the law 
however bush and the nations governors pledged during the 
education summit to try and eliminate the stringent federal 
regulations attached to the chapter one program 
before becoming a magnet school paint branch was declared 
eligible for the federal funds because a large percentage of its 
350member student body qualified for the school lunch program and 
scored poorly on academic achievement tests but when it began 
offering specialized instruction in math or science 200 students 
were bused in the student body swelled to 540 and the percentage 
of disadvantaged low achievers dropped 
many of the old students were still at the school but paint 
branch was told it was no longer eligible for chapter one money 
linda dudley the paint branch principal has done some juggling 
with budget and staff assignments to offer the advanced instruction 
that magnet schools promise while still providing for the 
lowincome lowachieving students in her classrooms 
its very very unfortunate said ms dudley chapter one 
is a support program and we argue that support programs should be 
delivered one way or another 
ms dudley acknowledges however that a certain prestige comes 
with being a magnet school the county school system has made these 
schools the cornerstone of its aggressive efforts to achieve 
academic success for all students 
warren simmons director of instructional support programs for 
the county sought guidance from the state on how magnet schools 
could fight the loss of funds as a result about 19 magnet schools 
described as nondedicated because not all of the youngsters 
receive the special courses are allowed to exclude the more 
affluent students from the calculations that determine eligibility 
for chapter one 
in essence chapter one regulations still operate and assume 
the existence of neighborhood schools schools attended by kids in 
the surrounding neighborhood said simmons the money flows to 
the community and not the kid 
paint branch was not among those nondedicated schools 
to make up for the loss of federal funds ms dudley made 
staffing changes that resulted in larger physical education and 
music classes an instructional aide was hired with the extra money 
ms dudley said one benefit of hiring an instructional assistant 
without chapter one money is that the school is not burdened by 
strict federal regulations and the instructors can be used more 
creatively 
she also instituted dual assignment team teaching where 
classes are combined for certain activities so some teachers can be 
free to provide extra time to certain chapter oneeligible students 
this year eight second graders were targeted for the schools 
first quarter and we expect those children to make a good 
halfyear gain in a short period of time under chapter one 100 
youngsters received special educational services 
we needed to create a different way to deliver services extra 
intensive services to some of these children she said what 
were trying is if we can give extraordinary services to a small 
group of children we will have them ready to join the regular 
program by the first grading period

president bush who maintained up until a 
month ago that soviet defense spending was growing received a 
classified pentagon report in may in which us intelligence 
analysts expressed the opposite view according to a published 
report 
the washington post reported that bush ordered the pentagon 
study of us defense strategy shortly after his election for help 
in dealing with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
a 26page executive summary of the secret report states there 
is broad agreement within the us intelligence community that 
the soviet union under gorbachev has decided to reverse a 20year 
pattern of growth in soviet military spending and force structure 
in order to boost the civil economy and soviet foreign policy 
the post said 
until a month ago bush and senior advisers criticized what they 
said was an increase in soviet defense spending as they pressed 
congress to approve the nearly 300 billion defense budget for 
fiscal 1990 
a white house spokesman interviewed by the post about the 
classified report said when it was written people were trying 
to prognosticate on the basis of soviet announcements and very 
early indications of soviet behavior in fact at that time our 
estimates were that there were few if any changes

president bush in sending two highlevel 
envoys to smooth us relations with china is virtually assuring 
himself of a new fight with congress in return for benefits that 
remain unclear 
the trip by national security adviser brent scowcroft and deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger announced in the middle of 
the night saturday by the white house made it appear bush is 
retreating from efforts to punish beijing over last junes bloody 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
the move has given new grist to congressional critics who 
already had found bush timid in his response to the chinese 
crackdown and who now suggest a curious contradiction a hardline 
bush when it comes to soviet human rights policy but a pushover 
for china 
there seems to be a double standard said rep stephen 
solarz dny who as chairman of the house foreign affairs asia 
subcommittee is a leading congressional spokesman on the far east 
secretary of state james a baker iii acknowledged sunday that 
topics of discussion between the presidents men and the chinese 
leadership include the status of fang lizhi a dissident who has 
taken sanctuary in the us embassy in beijing since the crackdown 
he declined to say whether any progress was being made toward 
freeing fang 
whether progress on that issue or some other potential gain was 
bushs object the domestic political risks are far more apparent 
solarz said the president risks abdicating policymaking on china to 
congress which more clearly reflects the will of the american 
people 
unless the situation changes congress when it returns in 
january is likely to force a new confrontation with bush over 
legislation formalizing and perhaps expanding us economic 
sanctions against china and over a bill granting chinese students 
automatic visa extensions if they are in danger of political 
persecution at home 
bush vetoed both measures in the waning days of the 1989 
congressional session he said he the bills were unnecessary 
because he took administrative action to accomplish the same things 
and because the bills were an unwarranted intrusion on his foreign 
policy prerogatives 
the scowcrofteagleburger mission was a departure from past us 
practice in which the china card usually has been played to 
gain leverage over the soviet union but at few times in history 
has the united states needed leverage less than in the current 
climate as communist rule crumbles in the soviet sphere of 
influence 
solarz speculated that bush and his two envoys both proteges of 
former secretary of state henry kissinger are living in the 
past 
these guys have a deep personal stake in the sinoamerican 
relation nixon kissinger and bush were all present at the 
creation solarz said theyre trying to preserve a 
relationship which they created and nurtured and which for a long 
time served the united states well 
the price is the apparent subordination at least in this case 
of the us commitment to human rights democrats can be expected 
to complain loudly and conservative republicans who are uneasy 
over bushs rapprochement with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev could well be brought to a boil by concessions to the 
more hardline beijing regime 
secretary of state james a baker iii sought to defend the move 
saying it was necessary to keep china within the international 
community and he played down the significance of the trip 
insisting china still must make progress on human rights before 
relations can be fully normalized 
weve made it very clear even in the aftermath of tiananmen 
that as much as we deplored what happened there this is a very 
important relationship in terms of its geopolitical and 
geostrategic importance to the united states and that we wanted to 
try and find ways to preserve it baker said

for more than a halfcentury the desolate 
beauty of a huge swamp west of miami has drawn hunters and outdoors 
lovers who have erected camps in the wilderness 
in 1974 the swamp became a preserve under the authority of the 
national park service and the legal status of those camps some 
little better than flypaper shacks others cinderblock structures 
with indoor plumbing gas stoves and even lawns in front of them 
has come into question 
about 100 people own camps on private land holdings that dot the 
big cypress national preserve but another 156 camps are on land 
that is now public property armed with a february ruling by a 
miami federal court the park service has targeted the squatter 
camps for demolition 
it really is pure and simple a legal issue said fred 
fagergren park service superintendent of the 716000acre 
preserve which is just north of everglades national park 
but for the squatters the future of the camps is a bitter 
emotional issue they are still disputing the ruling and have 
written 79 senators in a lastditch attempt to save their holdings 
with directions like take a right at the two pine trees 
deformed by lightning the makeshift camps arent easy to find 
license plates tacked to a tree welcome visitors to camps with 
names like firemens island scorpion head and fat charlies after 
a onehour airboat ride or a trip of up to four hours on swamp 
buggies soupedup customized fourwheel drive trucks 
but for all its forlorn quality the land itself inspires the 
squatters to considerable eloquence 
i walk out there and im in another world i cannot tell you 
spiritually or emotionally what that does its heaven said 
sonny nomes spokeswoman for a group that has sued to maintain the 
squatter camps 
nomes recalls a venemous cottonmouth snake that bit a boat 
engine an alligator that attacked a tire and admits there have 
been times when shes said to herself lady youve got to be 
crazy to be out here 
but you see this gorgeous untouched cypress that is so big 
around it would take you 50 feet or better to get it around and 
you see this lush pond next to it it takes your breath away 
nomes of miami said her first two dates with her husbandtobe 
were in the everglades 15 years ago theyve never owned a camp but 
have visited friends deep in big cypress for holidays hunting 
trips and relaxation 
the preserve is home to 11 endangered species notably the 
florida panther and 395 archaeological sites primarily indian 
burial mounds oil and gas exploration hunting offroad vehicles 
and cattle grazing are permitted in the preserve the squatters 
hunt deer turkeys and feral hogs 
the squatters claim the park service is ignoring congressional 
intent by ousting them no one bothered them when they built their 
camps on land titled to other owners before the preserve was 
created in 1974 with purchases from 47000 landowners 
a handful of camps were torn down earlier this year but 
fagergren waited for hunting season to die down before launching 
widespread demolition this month 
were being kicked out of the woods thats whats 
happening said jack moller who owns his own camp but fears all 
private interests in the preserve are being whittled away the 
park service likes everything to be totally regulated totally 
controlled in their back yard and they dont want to see mans 
influence anywhere 
the park service plans to build at least 50 primitive camps 
wooden platforms with roofs and screens for backcountry campers 
to use on a first comefirst serve basis as in most of the 
nations public camping areas 
but sid lewis whose 20yearold camp was demolished says hell 
use his own modified fourwheel drive toyota as a camp on wheels 
theres no way fred fagergren or anyone else is going to keep 
me out of the swamp it doesnt make any difference to me if i have 
to be in a tent said lewis of the miami suburb of hialeah i 
will continue year round as i always have i just wont have a camp 
to go to

antiabortion politics at the white house has 
interfered with scientific evidence and research on abortion in 
the department of health and human services the chairman of a 
house panel contends 
rep ted weiss dny charged in a report released sunday that 
the federal government has failed to report evidence of the 
relative safety of abortions for women 
his panel concluded after an investigation that the federal 
centers for disease control has censored research on abortion and 
urged that the department of health and human services take steps 
to assure public health research is not affected by politics 
it also recommended increased federal support for contraceptive 
research to help decrease the 15 million abortions obtained by 
american women every year 
this report provides important evidence of the relative safety 
of abortion for women since more than 90 percent of abortions 
performed in the us are much safer than pregnancy and childbirth 
and even the most dangerous types of legal abortions are equal in 
risk to carrying a pregnancy to term said weiss 
his statement was included with the report by the house 
government operations committee based on an investigation by its 
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations 
which weiss chairs 
in charging that scientific research by the cdc has been 
restricted by the political considerations in the reagan and 
bush administrations the committee cited a change in cdc 
statistics gathering 
five years ago it said the cdc stopped comparing the mortality 
and morbidity of women who had abortions with women carrying 
pregnancy to term comparisons had indicated women were between 
seven and 25 times more likely to die from childbirth than from 
legal abortion the report said 
jim brown a spokesman for james mason assistant secretary for 
health at hhs said that while mason was director of cdc from 1983 
until last winter there was not censorship on the abortion 
issue 
six republican house members filed a dissent charging the 
report was written with proabortion bias and paints a 
misleading and inaccurate picture 
the panel conducted an investigation into the efforts by the 
reagan administration to have its surgeon general c everett koop 
prepare a report on the health effects of abortion on women after 
conducting meetings and research koop in january wrote to 
president reagan saying there was insufficient information on which 
to base a report 
a draft of koops unreleased report was made public by the 
subcommittee in march it concluded that valid scientific studies 
have documented that modern abortion is a medically safe procedure 
and does not increase a womans subsequent risk of infertility 
miscarriage or premature births it concluded the frequency of 
longterm psychological effects is uncertain however 
in releasing its final report the panel included material from 
transcripts it subpoenaed of 27 confidential meetings koop held 
with antiabortion and abortionrights advocates 
according to the subcommittee koop stated in those meetings 
that legal abortion was safer than pregnancy and childbirth and 
posed no public health risks to womens mental or physical health 
it concluded koops letter to reagan was not consistent with the 
weight of evidence or koops own statements on health effects of 
abortion 
koop did not respond to a reporters call for comment last week 
the report cited cdc evidence that the risk of death from 
abortion doubles every two weeks after eight weeks gestation and 
that after the 16th week the risks are similar to those for 
childbirth 
don berreth a spokesman for the cdc in atlanta declined to 
comment on the report sunday saying officials there had not seen 
it

vp singh the man who reluctantly 
agreed to become prime minister of india has set out to prove hes 
in control 
as head of indias first minority government singh doesnt have 
a blank check to launch the revolutionary economic and social 
reforms that could allow india to join the ranks of the great 
powers in the next century 
but political observers and associates say the 58yearold prime 
minister has two things working in his favor a clean slate and a 
clean name 
within a week of taking the oath of office singh had reassured 
two embittered religious minorities they indeed have an important 
place in officially secular predominantly hindu india 
he appointed influential colleagues to lowerranking cabinet 
posts thereby denying them new power bases the more powerful 
posts went to men with the experience to push through change and 
the reputations for incorruptibility 
singhs fiveparty national front coalition denied prime 
minister rajiv gandhis congress party a majority in the nov 2226 
elections and brought down the nehru family dynasty that dominated 
indian politics since the country became independent from britain 
42 years ago 
but singh needs the continuing allegiance of both the hindu 
fundamentalists and the communists for his middleoftheroad 
alliance to muster a majority in parliament 
given the fragilility of this alliance many political observers 
are skeptical of the new governments ability to enact any major 
changes in the worlds largest democracy a country of 880 million 
people skewed between abject poverty and spaceage achievements 
the problems singh inherited are enormous but the 
mildmannered introverted politician who reluctantly agreed to 
head indias newest government has not been shy about what he 
intends to accomplish 
he lists his missions thus to eliminate poverty halt rising 
food prices that have doubled in the past year decentralize 
federal power reduce bureaucratic regulations and political 
meddling open the economy to western investors eager to do 
business with india and patch up differences with neighboring 
pakistan nepal and sri lanka 
foreign policy is a low priority for change 
singh has said he will not deviate from the course india has 
already charted between the worlds superpowers india he said 
will remain nonaligned and continue to build on its friendly 
relations with moscow and washington 
the first major test of singhs government provided it 
survives a confidence vote in parliament later this month will 
come during legislative elections in nine states in march and 
april all but two of the states now are dominated by gandhis 
congress party 
if congress loses it will split and the national front 
alliance will become stronger if congress defends its territory 
it will give renewed confidence to gandhi and his party and weaken 
our coalition then any constructive cooperation between us and the 
opposition will end said one national front member speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but analysts say singhs most immediate problems stem from 
factional disputes within his own janata dal or peoples party 
the largest group in the fiveparty national front those 
differences surfaced again recently during wrangling for cabinet 
posts 
singh appointed a moslem as head of the powerful home ministry 
a move seen as an attempt to span the growing rifts between the 
majority hindus and the minority moslems that erupted into riots in 
which at 300 people were killed this fall 
later he visited the northern state of punjab the hotbed of 
the sikh separatist movement and offered prayers at the sikhs 
holiest shrine the golden temple the visit by singh a hindu was 
the first by an indian prime minister in more than five years and 
an effort to end the bloody secessionist campaign that has claimed 
more than 12000 lives since 1982 
a nation is not a map on a piece of paper singh later said 
it lives in the hearts of the people and if the hearts are 
divided the nation stands divided we will not allow this to 
happen 
despite speculation that singh would keep the finance portfolio 
which he held for two years under gandhi he gave it to a veteran 
lawmaker who is expected to continue if not speed up the reforms 
singh sees as needed to make india a competitor in the world 
markets 
instead singh kept the defense portfolio a signal that he will 
wield considerable power since defense spending has received the 
biggest chunk of the national budget 
the move prompted speculation singh would be directly involved 
in investigation into controversial arms deals during the gandhi 
administration 
government corruption was the linchpin in the national fronts 
campaign against gandhi and the congress party and earned singh the 
nickname the new mr clean a reference to similar promises 
that gandhi made to clean up indias bureacracy 
gandhi was buffeted by accusations that highly placed indians 
received up to 50 million in kickbacks from the swedish arms firm 
ab bofors winner of a 1986 contract to sell 14 billion worth of 
howitzers to the indian government 
gandhis denials that any indians profited from the bofors deal 
paled before detailed newspaper investigations but the accusations 
have not been proved 
singh said there will be an investigation but not a vendetta 
i want to make it clear that we will not be vindictive 
singh said no scandal will be cooked up against him or anyone 
else the law of the land will prevail

a campaign march by hundreds of 
opposition supporters turned into a riot sunday police said at 
least one person was killed and witnesses said 20 people were 
injured 
two vehicles were burned and a private home and the local 
headquarters of the ruling sandinista front were sacked 
the fighting broke out during a rally by the national opposition 
union or uno when a group of about 20 sandinista loyalists and 
opposition followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town 
of 15000 people about 30 miles south of managua 
sandinistas accused sympathizers of the opposition coalition of 
starting the riot 
opposition leaders admitted their people took part but accused 
the sandinistas of provoking the riot saying sandinista 
infiltrators posing as opposition militants encouraged the attack 
on the houses and vehicles 
the local organizer of the opposition coalition jeremias 
mahmud said he saw a police officer draw his gun and shoot a man 
in the arm 
lt fernando montoya the masatepe police chief said police 
were following orders in not intervening in the riot until it was 
nearly over 
we had instructions not to get near the march montoya said 
going to the disturbances meant giving them uno a pretext to 
say that we were there to repress them 
national opposition union leaders have accused sandinista gangs 
of disrupting earlier opposition rallies for the feb 25 elections 
montoya said one person was killed but did not elaborate 
witnesses said at least 20 people were injured 
witnesses said groups of opposition activists attacked a house 
that was used by the sandinistas as a campaign office as well as 
another nearby house they said some activists set fire to a 
motorcycle and to a jeep with license plates from the un food and 
agriculture organization 
mahmud the opposition coalition organizer said he arrived as 
opposition sympathizers were stoning the sandinista headquarters 
he said a sandinista from the nearby town of la concepcion was 
leading the mob 
i told them that this man was an infiltrator and they beat him

president corazon aquino has shown 
steely resolve in confronting the armed challenge to her rule but 
it is unclear whether she is ready to move quickly on the manifold 
problems that helped trigger the latest coup attempt 
on saturday rebel soldiers gave up the last stronghold they 
seized dec 1 when thousands of military mutineers rose up against 
her in manila cebu city legazpi and elsewhere 
but the crisis facing the aquino government is far from over 
more than half the estimated 3000 rebels who battled government 
troops in the manila area remain at large including key leaders 
such as brig gen edgardo abenina and renegade lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan 
troops who did not join the revolt issued statements of support 
the grave social and political problems the mutineers tried to 
exploit remain unaddressed 
in one indication of the mood share prices tumbled on the 
manila stock exchange today in the first day of trading since the 
coup attempt was launched the manila composite stock index of 25 
selected issues fell 8 percent 
throughout the coup attempt mrs aquino adamantly refused to 
compromise with the mutineers even as rebel planes rocketed the 
malacanang presidential palace 
i promise you that i will continue to serve the filipino 
people and i will offer every moment of my life and i shall never 
let evil triumph in our country mrs aquino said sunday during 
funeral services for a loyal officer killed in the struggle 
those who are guilty will be meted out the full penalties 
after each of the five previous coup attempts mrs aquino made 
the same bold belligerent statements action proved weaker than 
rhetoric 
few participants were ever punished those who were sentenced to 
prison by military courts remain under house arrest pending review 
of their sentences 
this time however the administration may be considering a 
firmer response 
last week mrs aquino declared a national state of emergency 
specific powers made available to the president must be ratified by 
congress 
but congressional sources say the house of representatives and 
the senate are prepared to grant her broad temporary powers to 
suspend strikes conduct searches and seizures without warrants and 
take other measures to restore order and prevent another coup 
the emergency declaration has been widely applauded as a 
necessary step and welcome sign of firmness although some 
prominent human rights advocates expressed concern that it could 
infringe on personal freedoms 
mrs aquino also appears ready to confront civilian opposition 
politicians long suspected of having prior knowledge of coup 
attempts if not having been part of the financing and planning 
during a speech friday to a crowd of more than 100000 she 
singled out vice president salvador laurel sen juan ponce enrile 
and her promarcos cousin eduardo cojuangco for possible 
involvement in the coup attempt 
but others believe mrs aquino must also come to grips with the 
fact that her popularity has been declining in the face of rising 
prices a breakdown in law and order infrastructure decay and 
alleged corruption 
the bottom line here is can democracy work in the third world 
country wrote former presidential spokesman teodoro benigno in 
the philippine daily star can it work in the philippines with 
one of the highest poverty threshholds with a population that 
has doubled in 30 years so far it hasnt 
those behind the latest coup attempt apparently timed their 
attacks in hopes of expoiting public discontent most filipinos 
oppose a militarybacked government but still believe mrs aquino 
has been ineffective in coping with the nations problems 
it is time to show righteous anger and steely determination 
not only against enemies of the state but also against the sorry 
state of the nation wrote columnist antonio abaya in the manila 
chronicle 
after coup attempts in november 1986 and august 1987 mrs 
aquino revamped her cabinet many political commentators believe 
she must take the same step this time 
respected commentator luis beltran wrote in the manila standard 
that some advisers are urging a such change but others feel the 
show of support for mrs aquino at fridays rally indicate changes 
in the cabinet are not necessary 
before the rally columnist alvin capino wrote in the philippine 
daily globe that many people wanted to display solidarity with mrs 
aquino but that a large crowd would give president aquino the 
impression that they are happy with her administration 
government sources complain bitterly about inefficiency in the 
presidential palace staff where rival factions block directives 
they dont like 
sources familiar with the palace staff speaking on condition of 
anonymnity also complain that mrs aquinos advisers have isolated 
her from the problems of ordinary filipinos

president bush who until last month 
maintained that soviet defense spending was growing received a 
classified pentagon report in may in which us intelligence 
analysts expressed the opposite view a published report says 
bush ordered the secret study of us defense strategy shortly 
after his election as an aid for dealing with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev the washington post reported in todays 
editions 
a 26page executive summary of the report states that there is 
broad agreement within the us intelligence community that the 
soviet union under gorbachev has decided to reverse a 20year 
pattern of growth in soviet military spending and force structure 
in order to boost the civil economy and soviet foreign policy 
until a month ago bush and senior advisers criticized what they 
said was an increase in soviet defense spending as they pressed 
congress to approve the nearly 300 billion defense budget for 
fiscal 1990 
meanwhile bush said in interviews released sunday that he 
gained more respect for gorbachev at the malta summit and 
thinks he can trust the soviet leader 
gorbachev is up against some tremendous problems and is 
determined to solve them bush told newsweek magazine 
asked if his view of gorbachev had changed bush replied 
there is certainly an element of respect for the way he has 
managed the change in eastern europe and his determination to 
fight for perestroika reform at home 
i have more respect for him than i did back when he first came 
into office back when i first met him or when i saw him last 
year 
perestroika the russian word for restructuring is shorthand 
for the economic changes that gorbachev is pushing to revive the 
ailing soviet economy 
i think i can trust gorbachev bush said in an interview in 
time magazine i looked him in the eye i appraised him he was 
very determined yet there was a twinkle he is a guy quite sure of 
what he is doing he has got a political feel

local officials have found a way to get 
responses to a long survey on the towns rapid growth a reward 
officials in the southern maine community of 3500 people are 
giving respondents a shot at a 250 lottery so far 26 percent of 
townspeople have responded quite an improvement from another 
recent survey to which less than 2 percent responded 
raymond is required by state law to adopt a comprehensive growth 
plan by 1991 the population of the town in southern maine has 
increased 66 percent since 1980 
at first we thought this was kind of tacky like an insult to 
have a drawing for money when out of the goodness of their hearts 
and civic duty people should respond said chairwoman jackie 
hewitt of the raymond planning committee 
but we knew that in the past this hadnt worked so we decided 
to try a lottery she said 
questionnaires with lottery tickets stapled on were sent out 
in november residents have until january to respond 
committee members chose the 250 figure because they figured it 
would be large enough to attract attention but small enough to 
not lead to lying and cheating and stealing said town manager 
martin krauter 
some want more money 
id say 250 doesnt do much for people these days said jim 
phoenix owner of tommys sandwich shop if theyd have made it 
1000 theyd have gotten a lot more responses

five weeks after racist letters were 
sent to black students at macmurray college the incident has 
prompted raceawareness activities and some say a new climate on 
the campus 
before the letters there was a lot of tension but now its 
suppressed and everybodys making an effort said kevin ray a 
black freshman at the small liberalarts school 
i think before the letters macmurray was to some extent a 
closed community with the blacks on the outside looking in said 
ricky bragg a black sophomore since the letters ive noticed a 
lot more interaction between blacks and whites 
on nov 2 letters containing racial slurs and threats were 
found in campus mailboxes of the 35 to 40 black students at the 
620student school as well as that of the colleges only black 
staff member 
the letters were addressed to students by name and campus mail 
box number they contained epithets such as uncle tom and slurs 
specifically tailored to each recipient according to students who 
saw the letters 
four days later students marched in protest across the campus 
of the private college in westcentral illinois 
jacksonville police chief tom weeks says his department hasnt 
identified a suspect although police were able to take 
fingerprints from the letters 
its pretty much a dead issue right now weeks said 
student body president michelle sharp holds little hope that the 
culprit will be found 
i dont think well ever know who wrote the letters said 
ms sharp a junior majoring in education for the deaf i dont 
think it would be possible to fingerprint everyone on campus 
ms sharp who is white said it may be best that the writer 
remain unknown 
if its a white student its going to cause a lot of tension 
between blacks and whites she said if its a black student 
the blacks will be embarrassed i think many students would feel 
better not knowing 
since the letterwriting there havent been any racial 
incidents reported on campus the college has sponsored a forum for 
students to talk about racism and seminars on cultural diversity 
and a workshop on racism are in the works officials say more 
classes may include subjects of black interest 
the student government is planning an ethnic festival and the 
sale of tshirts promoting racial equality and the administration 
plans to make martin luther kings birthday a holiday 
college president edward mitchell said he wants to recruit more 
black faculty members but that its difficult because blacks who 
receive doctoral degrees are intensely sought by other colleges 
its just very difficult because of the small number in the 
pipeline and because in a school of this size and in a town this 
size theres just not the support network of other professional 
minorities mitchell said 
our best hope to recruit additional role models is going to be 
from our own students and thats going to take a while 
philosophy professor richard palmer said the incident gave a 
false picture of macmurray which he said has traditionally 
welcomed black students 
black senior marquita archie who said she cried each day for 
five days after the incident said the letters reflected the bias 
that is everywhere 
ms sharp the student body president said the students now 
realize that 
i think it affected the majority of the students on campus and 
opened a lot of students eyes about racial tension she said 
i know it opened mine

thousands of abortionrights and aids activists 
converged on st patricks cathedral forcing cardinal john j 
oconnor to temporarily halt mass as police carried out dozens of 
protesters on stretchers 
more than 100 people were arrested and three police officers 
sustained minor injuries authorities said 
inside where 43 were arrested demonstrators chained themselves 
to pews and lay in the center aisle 
outside about 4500 people marched along fifth avenue with 
some holding signs such as curb your dogma and pope john paul 
for ayatollah others chanted teach safe sex and just say 
no is not enough 
oconnor asked the congregation sunday to stand and join him in 
reciting prayers he was forced to skip his sermon handing out 
copies instead 
then as dozens of police hauled protesters away on bright 
orange stretchers oconnor resumed the mass 
gay activists have staged several demonstrations at st 
patricks since 1987 when oconnor barred a homosexual roman 
catholic group dignity from using church buildings 
those arrested were charged with disorderly conduct and 
trespassing said sgt peter sweeney a police spokesman 
the protest was organized by the aids coalition to unleash power 
act up and womens health action and mobilization wham 
we demand to bring our issues to the cardinal directly and 
thats what we did said organizer victor mendolia 
a statement by the groups said they do not challenge anyones 
right to worship as they choose however they criticized 
oconnor for his opposition to abortion and his vocal support of 
operation rescue which has blockaded abortion clinics for 
lobbying against education about safer sex and condoms especially 
in schools and for his opposition to gay rights legislation 
they are not moral issues they are political issues 
mendolia said their religious bullying infringes on the personal 
liberties of all americans 
church officials anticipating the wellpublicized 
demonstration cleared the church after the 9 am mass then 
searched the bags of everyone coming in for the 1015 am mass 
the cathedral doors were locked a few minutes after mass 
started said joe zwilling an archdiocese spokesman police were 
stationed throughout the massive cathedral even at the altar rail 
after the mass oconnor said the protest left him anguished 
the archbishop of new york must of course always preach what 
the church preaches teach what the church teaches oconnor 
said i cannot believe that anyone even those who hate what the 
church teaches would respect me for a moment if i taught anything 
else 
the congregation applauded enthusiastically 
oconnor later said he was particularly upset that one person 
who stood in line for holy communion broke the wafer and threw it 
on the floor 
among those inside was mayor edward i koch who is jewish and 
has differed with oconnor on the issues that sparked the protest 
but showed up to defend the cathedral 
you dont have a right to disrupt a church service koch 
said thats the law

vice president dan quayle wants the soviet union 
to work to repeal a 1975 united nations resolution that equated 
zionism with racism 
quayle also said he planned to tell un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar today that the united states wants the 
resolution repealed 
he said he planned to present perez de cuellar with a 65 
million check for us obligations to the world body 
on sunday quayle said soviet president mikhail gorbachev should 
show that he wants the united nations to play a bigger role in 
world affairs by helping sponsor a new resolution 
this resolution would state that zionism is not and never had 
been a form of racism furthermore we would declare once and for 
all the zionismisracism resolution null and void quayle told a 
yeshiva university audience at the waldorfastoria hotel where he 
received an honorary doctor of laws degree 
quayle praised the soviet unions new thinking in moving 
away from its antiisrael propaganda 
but the soviet union which was instrumental in passing the 1975 
resolution can do more by helping gain repeal of this loathsome 
provision quayle said 
zionism is the ideology on which israel is based

a disbarred lawyer just out of 
jail becomes deputy premier with partial responsibility for police 
a dissident journalist who also has done time and most recently 
stoked coal in a factory is named foreign minister 
a bank clerk takes over the finance ministry 
the appointments sunday show just how utterly a 3weekold 
peaceful popular revolt has turned czechoslovak politics on end 
the swift smooth revolution has ousted the leaders of the 
crackdown that followed the suppression of the 1968 prague spring 
reforms out are those who stripped of party membership half a 
million communists deemed too reformist 
many of the persecuted also lost all access to anything but the 
most menial jobs now those who suffered are returning with 
remarkable ease to take center stage in national politics 
the revolt has brought the ebullient jiri dienstbier working as 
a stoker since he last got out of jail in 1982 back to his 
original profession journalism a job he lost in the crackdown on 
prague spring reforms 
the only difference is that instead of writing stories 
dienstbier gave them out as spokesman for the civic forum 
opposition coalition 
now he is to serve as foreign minister a role civic forum 
thinks he is suited for because of his fluent english and french 
and experience in the far east and the united states in the 
mid1960s as a correspondent for state radio 
after he lost that job and his communist party membership 
dienstbier worked in the archive department of a design institute 
and wrote three books published in the west but banned in 
czechoslovakia 
once he signed the charter 77 human rights document in 1977 and 
became a leading member of vons a movement keeping track of 
political prisoners dienstbier found himself increasingly under 
police harassment 
in may 1979 the police arrested dienstbier vaclav havel and 
other leading vons activists in november that year dienstbier was 
sentenced to three years in jail since release he had worked as a 
stoker swapping shifts in a prague factory with another dissident 
petr uhl 
a far more recent exprisoner now in the government is jan 
carnogursky a dissident barred from practicing law since 1977 and 
a wellknown roman catholic activist in his native slovakia 
carnogursky was released from jail only two weeks ago one of 
the first political prisoners to be freed as the communists 
scrambled to meet the demands of prodemocracy demonstrators 
carnogursky 45 was arrested in midaugust along with four 
other dissidents for signing an appeal to slovaks to lay flowers in 
memory of those who died in the august 1968 sovietled invasion 
that crushed the prague spring reforms 
authorities charged carnogursky and miroslav kusy another 
slovak dissident named sunday as head of a new federal office of

a walkout by boeing co scientists engineers and 
technicians remains a longshot but they may reject contract offers 
that are smaller than production workers won in a 48day strike 
union leaders say 
boos and sardonic laughter punctuated a meeting of more than 
2000 of the 17600member seattle professional engineering 
employees association boeings secondlargest union 
the union has never struck and lacks a strike fund but many 
members carried signs and some distributed leaflets calling for 
contract rejection and a walkout at the worlds largest commercial 
jet builder 
also sunday a contract similar to one accepted by the 
machinists union was ratified by united aerospace workers local 
1069 the pact covers about 3000 workers at boeing helicopters at 
ridley township pa near philadelphia and is retroactive to oct 
5 
the machinists settlement which followed the longest strike 
against boeing in 41 years provided the economic guidelines that 
we could follow said robert torgerson of boeing helicopters 
at the seattle center coliseum hooting was loudest when union 
president charles bofferding emphasized that negotiators hadnt 
made a recommendation 
take a stand several people shouted 
ballots were mailed to members homes friday along with 30page 
booklets listing all changes from the threeyear pacts that expired 
dec 1 but were extended indefinitely as talks continued the vote 
count is set for dec 18 
one threeyear offer covers 15000 scientists and engineers the 
other is for 12800 technical support workers with almost all 
members of both units in the puget sound area 
engineers and scientists who earn an average of nearly 40000 
a year would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivity 
bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no further 
increases 
technicians with average pay of about 28000 would get annual 
increases of 3 percent 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of 10 
percent 5 percent and 4 percent 
the threeyear contract for boeings machinists included annual 
wage increases of 4 3 and 3 percent bonuses of 10 5 and 4 
percent of gross pay and an improvement in the costofliving 
formula from about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent 
the outcome of the voting is anyones guess bofferding said 
after the meeting 
i believe though the general response of our people to the 
wage proposal is fairly negative he added 
theres a reasonably good chance that the members would not 
accept the contract based on the mood tonight said negotiator 
richard van guilder of the technicians unit 
chief corporate spokesman harold carr said it was unfair to 
compare the machinists contract which covers 57800 workers to 
offers to the engineers and technicians was unfair 
the problem is when you try to compare a professional to a guy 
sweeping the factory floor that is not legitimate carr said

good relations with the united states 
the surprise oneday visit by over the weekend effectively ended 
a us ban on highlevel exchanges imposed after beijing 
authorities sent in the military to crush the prodemocracy 
movement in june 
both sides expressed their hopes for a truce in recent 
uschinese feuding with deng saying good relations are crucial 
for world peace and security however no concrete measures to ease 
frictions between the two sides were announced 
the ruling communist partys official peoples daily today 
carried two lengthy frontpage stories on scowcrofts meetings with 
chinese leaders including three separate pictures of the american 
emissary with deng premier li peng and party chief jiang zemin 
deng xiaoping says sinous relations should finally 
improve one headline said 
it noted that jiang spoke of the broad prospects for 
cooperation and li said both countries should do more practical 
work to improve relations 
lis remarks were at variance with previous chinese statements 
that the united states was entirely at fault for strained ties and 
must take the initiative in normalizing relations 
however a us official said it remains to be seen whether 
the good intentions expressed by both sides will result in any 
substantive progress in resolving conflicts 
those include us concerns over chinas human rights record and 
the issue of astrophysicist fang lizhi the prodemocracy dissident 
who has been hiding in the us embassy with his wife li shuxian 
since june and who is wanted by chinese police as a 
counterrevolutionary 
there is also speculation that beijing will retaliate against 
us measures to extend the visas of chinese students in the united 
states by halting widely popular student exchange programs 
in washington secretary of state james a baker iii defended 
president bushs decision to send the delegation six months after 
china began its crackdown by driving protesters from beijings 
tiananmen square 
hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military attack 
speaking on abctvs this week with david brinkley program 
baker said the president deplores the tragedy of tiananmen 
square but hes of the view that we shouldnt run the risk of 
compounding that tragedy by trying to isolate china from the 
international community 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee was among congressional critics of the trip 
he said at the very time that freedom is sweeping through 
eastern europe we should be sure the united states stands for

in an effort to cool an 
overheated economy the government has cut the value of the 
currency by more than half and ordered sharp fuel price increases 
the economy ministry in a communique issued minutes before 
midnight sunday said it was making corrections in the economic 
policy followed by the government of president carlos menen since 
his july 8 inauguration 
all banks and currency exchange houses were ordered closed today 
so the economic adjustments could be made more smoothly 
the corrections were required the ministry said to combat 
disturbances experienced in the exchange market in recent weeks 
the ministry said it would devalue the austral by 534 percent 
setting the official value of the national currency at 1000 to one 
us dollar compared to the 6501 official rate in effect since 
july 10 
the official exchange market will be used for sale and purchase 
of dollars in exportimport and financial operations the ministry 
said 
at the same time the ministry said it will permit the 
operation of a free exchange market for all other dollar 
transactions on which the value of the austral will be allowed to 
float 
an illegal although widely tolerated black market previously had 
operated in argentina and a widening gap between the official and 
black market values of the dollar had provoked concern in recent 
weeks 
on thursday the dollar sold for 1020 australs on the black 
market compared to the official value of 655 
the ministry also announced that the price of regular gasoline 
would rise by 61 percent to the equivalent of 144 per gallon 
economy minister nestor rapanelli said new rates for public 
utilities such as telephones natural gas and electricity would 
be announced today 
current public service rates were set july 9 when they were 
increased by 200 percent and were to have remained frozen for all 
of 1990 
the communique issued after menem met for three hours with his 
cabinet also announced a 30 monthly pay increase for public 
employes and a 24 raise for the private sector 
the communique said the treasury will cease to provide aid in 
financing deficits of state companies and provincial governments 
the government has moved cautiously on the issue of modifying 
current economic policy a devaluation was considered likely to 
fuel price increases wage demands and inflation also higher 
utility bills and transport fares might erode public support for 
the 5monthold government 
the cost of living which soared to nearly 200 percent in july 
had dropped by 56 percent in october but rose by 65 percent in 
november independent economists predicted the december rate could 
be in double digits

to work out a palestinian delegation to the first direct talks with 
israeli representatives officials said

reports that secret contacts already were under way among israeli 
egyptian american and palestinian officials to draw up a list of 
palestinian negotiators 
a plo spokesman in cairo said kamal was quoted in the yediot 
ahronot daily today as saying the organization had been asked to 
draw up three lists of names for presentation to the israelis 
on sunday the newspaper listed some of the palestinians under 
consideration as east jerusalem activist faisal husseini

estonians and latvians took part in the first 
major contested local elections in the soviet union and communists 
were expected to lose many of the city and regional council seats 
in the baltic republics 
latvian officials said first results would not be released until 
wednesday and an election official in estonia said results there 
might be available friday while latvians said it would be 
wednesday or later before they had results 
there were 33500 candidates running for the councils sundays 
elections were critical for local reforms because it is the vast 
numbers of local and regional bureaucrats who are blamed for 
blocking soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs programs 
the baltic elections are the soviet unions first major 
contested elections at the local level other republics will have 
their local elections later 
polls indicated environmentalists were likely to garner half the 
vote in estonia 
estonias department of public opinion and market research did a 
preelection poll showing the communists would receive less than 10 
percent of the vote with 100 percent turnout 
however they could fare even worse since many ethnic russians 
are boycotting the elections to protest a twoyear residency 
requirement for candidates 
in latvia communist candidates want to see latvia gain autonomy 
but remain in a reformed soviet federation while the grassroots 
popular front movement stands for outright independence and 
secession according to the official soviet news agency tass 
the popular front in latvia will be thrilled if it wins half the 
races because latvians are little more than 30 percent of the 
population said janis krumins deputy editor of atmoda the 
popular front newspaper hundreds of thousands of russians and 
other nonlatvians have moved into the republic in the nearly 50 
years of soviet power and they are divided on the independence 
issue 
the elections are the first in the soviet union to include 
candidates from de facto alternative political parties including 
environmentalists a group of farmers seeking the right to own land 
and an organization protecting the rights of immigrants 
political parties other than the communists have been legalized 
only in the neighboring baltic republic of lithuania and only 
last week 
a new national parliament was chosen in the nations first 
contested elections in the spring but 80 percent of the candidates 
were communist party members and the rest were independent

the infant who received the nations first 
livingdonor liver transplant underwent an operation to stop 
bleeding on the surface of the liver a condition doctors called 
common and controllable 
alyssa smith was in critical but stable condition today at the 
university of chicago medical center after the second operation in 
two days to stop bleeding on the surface of her new organ which 
she received two weeks ago 
the surgeon said the liver looked fine said john easton a 
spokesman for the medical center 
alyssa 22 months was in surgery for about four hours sunday 
the bleeding was controlled said dr christoph broelsch who 
led the transplant and the later operations 
doctors first detected the bleeding saturday afternoon when they 
noticed the childs abdomen had swelled said hospital spokeswoman 
mary fetsch 
she called the problem a minor setback 
its a common problem that happens in 30 percent of all 
livertransplant patients ms fetsch said you just never know 
when its going to happen but its something thats controllable 
and something you can manage 
the problem is the same one that prompted doctors to operate on 
alyssa within 12 hours after she received part of her mothers 
liver on nov 27 
the girl is the daughter of john l and teresa smith of schertz 
texas near san antonio 
the 29yearold mother was released from the hospital thursday 
and has been back to visit several times ms fetsch said 
meanwhile doctors were optimistic that 15monthold sarina 
jones the nations second livingdonor liver tranplant recipient 
would recover from her 7hour surgery performed friday 
shes doing better than expected ms fetsch said her 
liver functions look good so far and shes very alert 
sarina was expected to remain in critical but stable condition 
for the next few days as doctors watch for signs of rejection of 
the new organ or the bacterial infection that delayed the surgery 
doctors said her condition was unchanged this morning 
robert jones 20 from the memphis tenn area donated the 
left lobe of his liver to his daughter he was moved out of the 
intensive care unit sunday morning and was listed in serious but 
stable condition ms fetsch said

authorities in the southern steel town of 
nowa huta have quietly removed a statue of vladimir i lenin that 
youthful demonstrators have repeatedly defaced and tried to destroy 
the removal was ordered friday after demonstrations the past two 
wednesdays in which youths who threw paint and flammable liquids on 
the monument clashed with police who used water cannon and tear 
gas to disperse them 
the state pap news agency said the 30foot statue was emoved 
from its plinth and in perfect condition transported to the 
locality of wroblowice for necessary conservation works 
its future will be be decided by the municipal and district 
councils pap said but it is unlikely that anyone in nowa huta 
will want it back 
the monument to the founder of the soviet state placed on a 
central square had been the centerpiece of the city built around a 
huge steel mill outside krakow in the 1950s as a model socialist 
community 
for residents of nowa huta a solidarity stronghold it has long 
been a despised symbol of polands past forced dependence on the 
soviet union 
the attacks by the youthful demonstrators had created a delicate 
problem for the noncommunist government of prime minister taduesz 
mazowiecki 
the solidarityled government is trying to maintain good 
relations with the soviet union and said it would not tolerate more 
violence mediators had called on the local government to move 
quickly to remove the monument 
the statue has suffered several ignoble attacks over the years 
in 1979 it was dynamited by activists and had to be rebuilt by 
communist authorities 
a spokesman for communist president wojciech jaruzelski said the 
acts of vandalism met with his highest condemnation 
he believes these acts are manifestations of exceptional 
rampant fury they do harm to the good name of poland worldwide 
not only to the good relations with the soviet union said the 
spokesman wlodzimierz losinski 
the cultural commission of the krakow city council on saturday 
also closed the citys lenin museum and another cultural 
institution bearing his name the prosolidarity gazeta wyborcza

an alleged key member of the medellin cocaine 
cartel was extradited from uruguay to the united states despite 
escalating antiextradition terrorism the fbi has revealed 
uruguayan national police turned raul silvio vivas over to fbi 
agents at a naval base under heavy guard friday and he was flown to 
california that night said thomas r parker assistant agent in 
charge of criminal investigations and organized crime activities in 
los angeles 
hes very close to the top said fbi spokesman fred reagan 
the fbi said vivas an argentine was under tight security but 
refused to disclose his location more specifically than the los 
angeles metropolitan area vivas was scheduled to appear before a 
us magistrate in los angeles today 
vivas 39 accused of laundering more than 1 billion for the 
colombian cartel and a target of a us department of justice 
moneylaundering probe codenamed polar cap had been held in 
an uruguayan jail since february 
his extradition however occurred just two days after a 
devastating terrorist bombing blamed on cocaine traffickers killed 
dozens and wounded hundreds outside colombias police intelligence 
headquarters 
a group of drug lords calling themselves the extraditables 
has been waging a terror campaign of bombings and assassinations to 
force the government to end its war on the cartel and forestall 
extraditions 
parker said vivas was a badly wanted fugitive and his 
extradition marks yet another turning point in the willingness of 
the international community particularly in south america to work 
with us in bringing to an end the tyranny and impunity of these 
drug empires 
the us indictment of vivas and 30 others was handed up in 
february 
it charged them with carrying out the largest colombian drug 
cartel money laundering operation ever uncovered by american law 
enforcement authorities parker said vivas is accused of 
personally controlling the flow of more than 1 billion in drug 
money he said 
vivas has said he is a legal trader in gold uruguay with some 
of the most liberal banking laws in south america allows both 
citizens and foreigners to enter and leave the country with gold 
and freely transfer capital in and out 
vivas transfer to fbi custody was conducted under a blanket of 
police protection in uruguay on friday 
he was led handcuffed from a jail cell in maldonado 90 miles 
east of montevideo local radio stations reported 
police sharpshooters stood guard atop buildings while vivas was 
put in a helicopter for a short ride to the captain curbelo navy 
base access to the base was blocked off and its perimeter was 
patrolled by other helicopters a dozen fbi agents took custody of 
vivas on board a us plane

according to reports reaching moscow 
president mikhail s gorbachev also facing pressure from 
hardline communists angrily offered to resign as party leader 
after criticism of his overtures to the west said a member of the 
partys policymaking central committee who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
sakharov and several other parliamentarians on sunday urged the 
national strike to pressure the congress of peoples deputies to 
vote on rescinding article 6 of the soviet constitution which 
guarantees the communists the leading and guiding role in 
society they also want the congress which opens tuesday to act 
on several key reform laws 
sakharovs group failed to win the support of 400 progressive 
parliamentarians the interregional group voted sunday to favor the 
goal of rescinding communist supremacy but did not back the strike 
members said the public mood was too explosive 
strikes have ravaged the struggling soviet economy since last 
summer consumers are angry over shortages of food and consumer 
goods and officials now warn that citysupplied steam heat could 
be affected by a coal strike in the depths of an already bitter 
russian winter 
on the streets of the capital today it was business as usual 
stores and transport operated and no pickets were in evidence 
however 214 of the 500 researchers at the academy of sciences 
geography institute in moscow stopped their scientific studies for 
two hours said galina koslovsky an interpreter for the institute 
they spent the time writing a resolution supporting the deputies 
call for a vote on article 6 and critical economic reforms then 
sent the text to the kremlin before returning to work 
in latvia some store clerks and transport workers heeded the 
latvian popular fronts call to show solidarity with sakharovs 
call through a work stoppage of 15 minutes said maris melans of 
atmoda the popular front newspaper 
the soviet communist party is facing unprecedented challenges to 
its monopoly on power the lithuanian legislature voted last week 
to eliminate the partys constitutional guarantee of supremacy in 
that republic 
estonians and latvians voted for new city and regional council 
members in elections viewed as a referendum on the communist party 
and the independence of the two republics from moscow communist 
officials faced overwhelming defeat 
all three baltic republics were annexed by the kremlin in 1940 
the elections sunday were the first in the soviet union to 
include candidates from de facto alternative political parties 
first results were not expected until later today at the earliest 
in moscow on sunday 5000 people marched in subzero 
temperatures in support of reformist lawmakers police did not stop 
that protest but they pushed several hundred others off pushkin 
square after speakers ripped up photographs of gorbachev and soviet 
founder vladimir lenin 
demonstrators chanted freedom freedom as the helmeted 
riot police punched shoved and kicked them tass said 20 people 
were detained 
boris yeltsin an unorthodox member of the 250member central 
committee told fellow reformers that saturdays committee meeting 
was dominated by conservatives complaining about gorbachevs 
changes 
a conservative central committee member speaking sunday on 
condition of anonymity said gorbachev offered to resign after 
kemerevo party chief alexander melnikov really let himself get 
carried away and said something like this is it proper to go 
bowing to the capitalists to go asking a blessing from the pope 
the source who attended the meeting said gorbachev was irked 
by the criticism of his moves to make peace with the west and 
offered to step down if the full committee agreed with melnikov 
other members immediately voiced support for gorbachev and 
melnikov apologized the source said 
gorbachev warned that the situation in the soviet union is 
unbelievably crucial according to the transcript of his speech 
carried by tass 
the soviet people do not want to put up with the fact that at 
a time when the normal rhythm of life has been broken their local 
and national leaders are often doing nothing he said 
gorbachev said he was willing to accept a change in the 
communist partys constitutional guarantee of supremacy but not 
immediately tass said he said it should come only as part of 
sweeping constitutional reforms 
gorbachev cited the nations serious economic troubles in 
arguing that the second session of the congress of peoples 
deputies which begins tuesday must concentrate on economic 
reforms and not veer off into a discussion of constitutional issues

job after refusing to wear a necktie returned to the classroom

shirt and jeans no tie 
one year ago this month the mason county board of education 
fired bill webb for refusing to conform to a new dress code today

began said today that webbs return was not a major event 
i like him hes all right said senior donnie patterson 
adding that there was little discussion about webbs case

contends that the school board doesnt have a right to tell him 
what to wear

dress code is unconstitutional webb said the code shouldnt apply 
to him anyway because it was put into effect after he had signed 
his contract for the 198889 school year

kaufmans ruling but they have consented to allow webb to return 
to work while the state supreme court considers their appeal

an iowa woman battling her states mandatory 
seatbelt law lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment refused to hear linda diane 
clarks arguments that the law similar to those in most states 
violates her constitutional rights 
mrs clark a marshalltown housewife was ticketed april 26 
1988 for not wearing a seatbelt while teaching her daughter how to 
drive the family car 
the violation carries a 10 fine with court costs mrs clark 
faced paying 2150 
challenging her jurytrial conviction through the iowa courts 
and to the supreme court has cost her about 1000 so far mrs 
clark said in a recent telephone interview lots of people said 
why dont you just pay the 2150 but its the principle of the 
thing 
the last bill mrs clark received she has yet to pay the fine 
or any court costs was for 6650 
mrs clark acted as her own lawyer throughout the unsuccessful 
court fight 
the iowa supreme court ruled in another case that the state law 
is constitutional and spent just two paragraphs in upholding mrs 
clarks conviction last sept 18 
in the appeal acted on today mrs clark said this case 
provides the court with an opportunity to delineate the boundaries 
of state action as regards inalienable rights of the individual 
citizens 
arguing that the safety of wearing seatbelts is questionable 
mrs clarks appeal said when state regulation causes injury and 
death by an unproven speculative measure of safety a justiciable 
controversy exists 
mrs clark told the associated press she believes her right to 
travel and her right to be free from unnecessary government 
regulation is violated by the seatbelt law 
in a free country they cant do that she said 
mrs clark said she has no doubt the time and money invested in 
her court case was well spent 
quoting from a 1950 dissenting opinion by the late supreme court 
justice hugo black mrs clark said it is not the function of 
our government to keep the citizen from falling into error it is 
the function of the citizen to keep the government from falling 
into error

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
a former gambling casino owner convicted of bank fraud and ordered 
to pay 75 million in restitution 
the court without comment let stand a ruling against 
businessman ronald cloud stemming from the 1985 sale of his 
hotelcasino complex in the lake tahoe area on the 
californianevada border 
cloud purchased the complex the calneva lodge for 10 million 
in 1980 and decided to sell it a few years later because of 
mounting operating losses 
jon perroton agreed to buy the complex for 17 million but 
perroton got a 20 million loan from the hibernia bank to finance 
the purchase after misrepresenting the sale price as 275 million 
perroton pleaded guilty to bank fraud and other charges and was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison 
cloud was convicted by a federal jury of aiding and abetting 
bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud 
he was placed on probation for five years fined 500000 and 
ordered to pay 75 million to continental insurance co to 
reimburse it for some of the money it paid to the hibernia bank 
cloud said he went along innocently with the phony loan amount 
on assurances from perroton that there was nothing wrong with it 
cloud said he never intended to defraud the bank and was a victim 
of perrotons scheme 
cloud also said he should not be forced to pay the insurance 
company 75 million because he previously reached a settlement 
with the hibernia bank to repay it 15 million 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals rejected his appeal last 
april 
the appeals court said there was sufficient evidence to convict 
cloud and a federal judge who ordered the restitution acted under 
proper authority granted by the federal victim and witness 
protection act 
the case is cloud vs us 89455

the communists policysetting central 
committee met today following the nations largest prodemocracy 
rally in which tens of thousands of people demanded that party 
leaders share power 
also today the municipal court in sofia approved the 
registration application of ecoglasnost making the environmental 
organization bulgarias first legal independent political group 
party leader petar mladenov opened the central committee session 
with a speech on the situation in the country the party and the 
immediate tasks the state news agency bta said the dispatch 
gave no further details 
about 5000 people held a silent vigil in 14degree temperatures 
earlier in the day outside party headquarters to show the communist 
leadership the people were watching its work according to 
organizers 
on sunday more than 50000 people chanted democracy and 
applauded demands for the communist leadership to quit it was the 
biggest rally of its kind since bulgarias prodemocracy movement 
began less than a month ago and since the party consolidated power 
43 years ago 
many people held candles in the bright sunshine at todays 
vigil and a white red and green bulgarian flag waved on a 
platform set up behind the central committee building 
police set up barriers to keep the gathering from disrupting 
morning traffic and a few officers stood at a distance around the 
crowd after one hour the crowd dispersed quietly 
organizers said similar vigils would be held later today and on 
tuesday 
the central committee meeting was expected to last at least two 
days and focus on growing grassroots demands for the kind of 
democratic reforms that have swept poland hungary east germany 
and czechoslovakia 
the central committee also met friday in a session that was not 
announced and 22 people were removed from the committee and four 
from the ruling politburo 
if the committee were to resign a new one would have to be 
elected at a party congress 
the communist party daily rabotnichesko delo today carried a 
guest commentary in which the author urged an extraordinary 
congress to be held as soon as posible and suggested the end of 
february as a possible date 
the paper said it had received more than 4000 letters and 
telephone calls from people demanding reforms since nov 10 when 
mladenov replaced todor zhivkov who was communist party chief for 
35 years 
a poll conducted by a central committee polling group indicated 
that only 23 percent of those questioned had a lot of trust in the 
party the newspaper reported 
it said 1513 people from 127 work collectives were questioned 
in the poll conducted nov 28 
the newspaper said only 32 percent showed general trust in any 
political organizations it concluded that the communists had 
discredited themselves in the eyes of the people while 
opposition groups had not had a chance to test their political 
ability 
sundays rally was organized by 19 independent groups that 
drafted a resolution urging talks between the communists and the 
groups 
protesters waved their hands in the air to show approval of the 
resolution which recognized moves toward liberalization since 
zhivkov was ousted but it complained that reform was too slow in 
coming 
popular pressure for the party to give up its constitutionally 
guaranteed leading role has been growing and the crowd repeatedly 
cheered that demand 
last week mladenov told a news conference in moscow that he 
foresaw changes in the constitution and indicated the partys 
leading role was an open question 
the municipal court in sofia has previously rejected 
ecoglasnosts application for legal status as an independent 
political group it changed its mind three days before parliament 
is to meet to discuss issues including a proposed law on 
associations 
ecoglasnost has played a key role in mobilizing people to press 
for reforms it also a member of the newly formed umbrella union of 
democratic forces which comprises the 10 most influential 
independent groups 
petar slabokov a wellknown actor and the president of 
ecoglasnost said one of the groups first projects will be to 
determine whether the general health of people has been damaged by 
air and river pollution

in a decision narrowing the reach of the 
freedom of information act the supreme court today shielded the 
fbi from having to give grumman corp documents received from 
another government agency 
by a 63 vote the court said the documents can be withheld 
because they were compiled for law enforcement purposes and 
therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing 
government secrecy 
grumman and the defense contract audit agency exchanged letters 
in 1978 in the exchange the pentagon agency questioned certain 
accounting practices grumman used for defense contracts grumman 
defended its practices and no government action was taken 
the fbi began a criminal investigation of grumman in 1985 and 
the exchange of letters was sent from the audit agency to the fbi 
grumman filed an foia lawsuit in 1987 seeking all documents 
that are related in any way to the subject of the 1978 
correspondence 
a federal judge ruled against the contractor saying release of 
the documents would jeopardize a grand jury investigation 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york city ruled 
that the foia requires release of the documents 
the appeals court said the exemption for documents compiled for 
law enforcement purposes does not apply in this case because the 
letters were not originally obtained or generated for law 
enforcement purposes 
today the supreme court said the appeals court was wrong about 
the exemptions scope 
documents having been compiled once for the purpose of routine 
audits wer not disqualified from being compiled again later for a 
different purpose justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court 
we do not accept the distinction the court of appeals drew 
between documents that originally were assembled for law 
enforcement purposes and those that were not so originally 
assembled he said 
blackmun said soughtafter documents may fall under the foia 
exemption if they have been gathered or stored by a law enforcement 
agency when the response to the foia request must be made 
blackmuns opinion was joined by chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices william j brennan byron r white sandra 
day oconnor and anthony m kennedy 
justices john paul stevens antonin scalia and thurgood marshall 
dissented 
the case is john doe agency vs john doe corp 881083

an opposition campaign rally turned 
into a riot in which one person was killed and more than 20 people 
injured foreign observers blamed the violence on sandinista 
provocateurs 
sundays violence lasted four hours and was the worst of the 
campaign leading to general elections set for feb 25 foreigners 
said the clashes raised doubts the balloting would be held without 
incident 
opponents and supporters of the ruling sandinistas fought with 
machetes knives broken bottles rocks and sticks in this town 30 
miles south of managua the local sandinista front headquarters was 
sacked and two vehicles were burned 
manuel guevara calero 38 of the nearby village of la 
concepcion was stabbed to death reports in progovernment 
newspapers today quoted his mother hilda calero and an 
unidentified relative as blaming supporters of the national 
opposition union or uno 
i came here assuming that there would be free and open 
elections said robert beckel of the washingtonbased center for 
democracy a bipartisan group invited to observe the electoral 
process you cant witness what we saw today and believe theres 
any way therell be a fair election in this country 
the opposition has accused sandinista gangs of disrupting 
earlier opposition rallies 
sundays fighting broke out during a rally organized by the uno 
when a group of about 20 sandinista loyalists and opposition 
followers exchanged insults and then blows in this town of 15000 
people 
beckel and an opposition organizer jeremias mahmud said a 
series of provocations by sandinista supporters sparked the riot 
its very clear to me that sandinista supporters were 
constantly probing the perimeter of this rally looking to disrupt 
it said beckel who managed democrat walter mondales 1984 
presidential campaign it was too clear they showed up at 
specific times and the police disappeared 
lt fernando montoya masatepe police chief said he had been 
ordered to keep police away from the rally he said he did not want 
to give opponents of the leftist sandinistas a pretext for them 
to say that we were there to repress them 
witnesses said at least 20 people were injured they said 
sandinista activists threw rocks during an opposition march 
reappeared to trade insults with the crowd while candidates were 
delivering speeches and withdrew after being admonished by 
observers from the organization of american states 
the sandinista militants appeared again after the event had 
ended and the opposition crowd estimated at about 2000 was 
dispersing 
people were slashed with machetes knives and broken bottles 
rocks were thrown and people hit with sticks 
beckel said he was pushed to the ground as opposition and 
sandinista supporters threw stones at each other he said rescued a 
girl about 5 years old who apparently became separated from her 
mother 
the girl was getting trampled so i pulled her out from 
underneath it beckel said the machetes came out and we were 
four feet from the fighting 
beckel was hit on the back of the head and hurt slightly he 
said he and the little girl crawled away then ran 
ricardo lopez cerda a member of the sandinista campaign 
committee said he and 12 other people had taken refuge in the 
party headquarters when he saw about 200 people approach lopez 
said he heard the crowd shout that they were coming to kill 
everyone inside 
he and the others escaped through the back of the building the 
building was heavily damaged and the furniture inside burned a 
home next door also was sacked and a jeep and a motorcycle set 
ablaze 
on dec 3 a group of sandinista supporters attacked a house 
being inaugrated as the local opposition coalition headquarters in 
cofradias a village 12 miles east of managua dozens of people 
were injured in a rockthrowing melee 
presdent daniel ortega moved up the general elections by a year 
as part of an agreement by central american to end regional 
insurgencies 
the usbacked contra rebels have fought the sandinistas since 
1981 and are based in neighborning honduras under the aug 7 
agreement they were to have been disbanded last week 
but the contras remain intact and president bush has indicated 
he wants them to remain a viable force to ensure the sandinistas 
hold clean elections

iran has been advising its friends in 
lebanon to release their western hostages a senior iranian 
official was quoted as saying in a newspaper interview published 
today in this persian gulf nation 
we have directed our advice to our friends in lebanon to cease 
their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the western 
hostages the newspaper alraya quoted deputy foreign minister 
ali mohammed besharati as saying 
but the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes 
propitious for the release of the hostages there are 
counterincidents that cloud the atmosphere said besharati who 
was on a twoday visit that ended sunday 
the paper said he was specifically referring to the kidnapping 
by israeli commandos of sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem 
preacher from south lebanon on july 28 
on july 31 shiite moslem kidnappers of the organization of the 
oppressed on earth said they killed their american hostage lt col 
william higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping 
most of the 18 western hostages held in lebanon are believed to 
be in the hands of iranianbacked shiite groups they are eight 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss an irishman 
and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 in west beirut 
the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the election of the 
more pragmatic president hashemi rafsanjani gave rise to some hopes 
of iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives

noshow or consistently awol national guard 
soldiers have inflated federal funding to new york state and given 
officials the false impression that the force is combatready a 
newspaper reported today 
between 1600 and 4000 national guard soldiers in the state are 
absent without leave and should be dismissed the new york post 
said 
noshows are not paid but the pentagon sets minimum manpower 
requirements and provides funds for equipment and training based on 
those numbers 
the newspaper said its investigation concluded that the phantom 
force was created in 1984 by vito castellano commander of the new 
york state guard from 1975 to 1986 who became ensnared in the 
wedtech scandal 
castellano was released from prison in july after serving one 
year for taking bribes and using his position to lobby for wedtech 
the defunct defense contractor 
castellano could not be reached today for comment on the post 
report calls this morning to a telephone listed in his name in a 
new york suburb went unanswered 
lt col james otoole the state guards personnel director 
said probably about 1600 guard members should be discharged 
for absenteeism but reports indicated the figure may be much 
higher federal regulations say soldiers with nine unexcused 
absences must be dismissed 
a congressional report said that in the 1988 new york guard 
training session absenteeism was 32 percent the post said 
and a confidential guard report a military personnel profile 
for its new york city division the 42nd showed that 3367 
guardsmen have been absent from drills and training sessions at 
least nine times the newspaper said 
maj gen lawrence p flynn commander of the state guard said 
he was keeping noshows on the roster despite the rules in hopes 
they could be restored to active duty it is cheaper than 
recruiting new soldiers he said 
he could not provide figures on how many absentee guardsmen had 
returned to duty 
if the absentees are dismissed the pentagon will have to 
classify new york as unprepared for combat according to the report 
the new york national guard already has the second worst 
attendance records in the nation but its budget has tripled since 
1975 to 390 million the newspaper said 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified former top castellano aide 
as saying that castellano ordered absentee guardsmen kept on the 
roster

the leadership of yugoslavias 
secondlargest state today for the first time called for the 
establishment of a multiparty system in this communist country 
communists have been slow in realizing the historic exhaustion 
of the singleparty system stanko stojicevic head of the 
croatian communist partys ruling presidium said at the opening of 
a regional party congress in the croatian capital of zagreb 
there can be no democratic socialism without political 
pluralism based on the right of association and competition of 
political movements and programs stojicevic said in his 
keynote speech carried by the state tanjug news agency 
until now the liberal northern state of slovenia was the only 
one of yugoslavias six constituent republics to openly advocate 
the introduction of westernstyle democracy 
about a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up 
in slovenia over the past year and the region plans to hold its 
first free legislative elections next march 
on sunday some 25000 people in several croatian cities signed a 
petition urging legalization of numerous parties that would make 
possible the holding of free elections in the republic bordering 
slovenia in the west 
we consider that yugoslavias new constitution should 
provide for a political system that will include parties and 
movements representing the political interests of citizens said 
stojicevic according to a report broadcast by zagreb radio 
croatia and some other republics have in the past been 
noncommittal about multiparty democracy which is vehemently 
opposed by the communist leadership of the countrys largest state 
of serbia 
earlier this month serbia in an apparent move to stifle 
burgeoning democratic trends in the country severed all business 
and official ties with slovenia the unprecedented action shook the 
foundations of yugoslavias loose federal system 
stojicevic sharply denounced serbias break with slovenia 
describing the consequences as dramatic with a possibly 
catastrophic outcome 
ultimatums and the severance of economic relations 
accusations and threats represent a direct attack on the 
constitutional order of the country and its economic and political 
integrity stojicevic said 
slovenias parliament met today to discuss serbias actions 
which slovenian president janez stanovik said were a heavy blow 
to the yugoslav federation 
he said serbia was trying to eliminate all those who hold 
differing opinions and to produce a change of the constitutional 
order 
the blockade of slovenia therefore represents an act of 
aggression against yugoslavia he told lawmakers 
croatias state leadership which had earlier sought to remain 
on the sidelines of the dispute between serbia and slovenia came 
out strongly last week in favor of slovenia 
croats and serbs are traditional archrivals in yugoslavias 
patchwork of nationalities and an open clash between the two 
regions could seriously threaten the unity of this balkan nation 
yugoslavia has for years been a socialist showcase despite its 
oneparty system 
but political economic social and ethnic problems have 
mushroomed since the death in 1980 of president josip broz tito 
whose charisma was seen as a major force in bounding together the 
divergent ethnic groups in the country

a state senator beat former ku klux klan 
leader david duke in republican caucuses to stake an early claim to 
the gop endorsement in next years us senate race 
by winning saturdays caucuses sen ben bagert of new orleans 
became the frontrunner heading into the republicans jan 13 state 
convention bagert won 383 or 70 percent of the 544 delegates 
selected at 14 caucuses 
at stake is which republican will win the right to challenge 
democratic incumbent bennett johnston 
duke who was elected as a state representative last year amid 
controversy because of his racial views won 27 delegates 
secretary of state fox mckeithen won 25 delegates and 109 were 
uncommitted 
however the victory does not guarantee bagert the nomination 
an additional 656 delegates still must be chosen and pledges of 
support made at party caucuses are not binding 
bagert said the caucus victory gave his candidacy a stamp of 
approval 
both bagert and mckeithen have said theyll drop out of the race 
if they dont get the party nomination duke has said hell run 
even if he isnt endorsed 
formal endorsement against johnston dla also would mean 
republican financial support money party newsletters and 
volunteers however in louisianas unique open primary system 
anyone can register as a candidate regardless of party and be 
placed on the ballot the primary is set for oct 6 1990 if no 
one gets a majority the two top finishers will advance to the 
november election 
bagert was by far the strongest candidate said darryl 
gissel state republican party director 
duke who said he does not expect the partys endorsement 
blamed his weak showing on his late entry into the race 
weve organized this thing for three days theyve been at it 
for three months duke said im encouraged given the time we 
spent on it

the supreme court ruled today that federal 
judges may help plaintiffs in age discrimination suits try to find 
other possible victims and seek their participation in such suits 
the justices by a 72 vote ruled against hoffmannla roche 
inc which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off 
some 1200 employees at new jersey plants 
the high court said judges in such class action suits may 
help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination 
who may be unaware of the lawsuit and solicit their participation 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said judges 
have discretion to authorize such notices to potential plaintiffs 
that serves the legitimate goal of avoiding a multiplicity of 
duplicative suits and setting cutoff dates to expedite disposition 
of the action he said 
but he said judges must be scrupulous to respect judicial 
neutrality and not give even the appearance that they are 
endorsing the suit 
in other action the court 
refused to reinstate former white house aide lyn nofzigers 
conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the reagan 
administration 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that overturned nofzigers 1988 conviction 90day jail 
sentence and 30000 fine 
shielded the fbi from having to give grumman corp documents 
received from another government agency narrowing the reach of the 
freedom of information act 
by a 63 vote the court said the documents can be withheld 
because they were compiled for law enforcement purposes and 
therefore are exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing 
government secrecy 
turned away an appeal by an iowa woman battling her states 
mandatory seatbelt law 
the justices without comment refused to hear linda diane 
clarks arguments that the law similar to those in most states 
violates her constitutional rights 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice antonin scalia 
dissented in the agediscrimination case 
scalia writing for both said nothing in the federal law 
against age bias authorizes judges to undertake the unheardof 
role of midwifing lawsuits against employers 
hoffmannla roch dismissed some 1200 workers on feb 4 1985 a 
group of older workers who called the day black monday for 
many veteran workers said a disproportionately high number of 
laidoff workers were over 40 years old 
the group filed a lawsuit charging the company with violating 
the federal age discrimination in employment act 
the groups leaders then sought to contact all fired workers 
over 40 eligible to join the lawsuit 
some 400 fired employees agreed to join but leaders of the 
court battle against the company said they believed there might be 
200 additional fired workers who are members of the class allegedly 
victimized by age discrimination 
the leaders sought to contact the missing workers by mail and 
notices posted at hoffmannla roche plants 
us district judge harold a ackerman ordered the company to 
provide the names and addresses of all fired workers and ackerman 
said once the missing workers are found they may be sent an 
explanation of the suit and a form seeking their consent to join 
the court fight 
the form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no 
position on the merits of the case 
an increased number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big 
advantage for the workers because it spreads out court costs in 
seeking workers to join the suit the leaders of the court fight 
asked but did not require a 200 contribution to help defray the 
costs 
the supreme court today upheld a ruling by the 3rd us circuit 
court of appeals 
the case is hoffmannla roche vs sperling 881203

us secretary of state james a baker iii met 
today with prime minister margaret thatcher and said he does not 
believe washington and london are drifting apart over west european 
unity 
i dont think there are any fences that need mending we 
feel a special relation to the united kingdom and to the prime 
minister baker told reporters outside mrs thatchers 10 downing 
street office 
baker met with mrs thatcher at the start of a weeklong european 
trip seeking allied unity amid the rapid political changes sweeping 
europe also on the agenda is the sensitive issue of german 
reunification 
from london baker was flying to berlin tonight he is scheduled 
to meet west german chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday and visit the 
berlin wall 
a call by president bush at a nato meeting last week for an 
intensified effort by the 12member european community to unify 
was interpreted by some analysts as a prod to mrs thatcher the 
most outspoken opponent of rapid european integration 
i dont really think there is a drifting apart baker said 
after meeting mrs thatcher i think that there was some 
misunderstanding last week with respect to exactly what was meant 
he added in apparent reference to bushs integration call 
baker who flew overnight from washington held his first 
official talks with britains new foreign secretary douglas hurd 
who was appointed six weeks ago before meeting mrs thatcher 
his task is to assure them the us special relationship 
with britain is firm and to solicit their views on how the west 
should approach the volatile political upheavals in the east 
european landscape 
there is support within the bush administration for an 
acceleration of the political union of western europe that might 
include a reunited germany 
mrs thatcher has doubts even about the current pace bakers 
stop was added after bush telephoned the prime minister to assure 
her the special relationship between washington and london was 
intact 
east germany opened the berlin wall and its other borders a 
month ago permitting thousands of cheering germans to cross freely 
to the west for the first time since 1961 hundreds danced on the 
wall 
bakers visit is designed to be lowkey in order not to provoke 
the soviet union 
he is not going to dance on the berlin wall said a senior 
administration official 
the sixday trip initially was scheduled as an uneventful winter 
meeting later in the week with the foreign ministers of the 15 nato 
countries in brussels the headquarters of the western alliance 
but political upheavals in east germany and czechoslovakia 
following the sharp detour from orthodox communism in poland and 
hungary is sending baker into talks with western partners in an 
atmosphere of uncertainty 
they will discuss whether soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
will continue to encourage change with unrest mounting in east 
germany and the abolition of the communist partys monopoly of 
power in the soviet republic of lithuania 
managing economic aid for poland and hungary and the future of 
nato as a military alliance while eastwest tensions recede are 
also on bakers agenda in brussels 
there is also the overriding issue of german reunification and a 
sharp warning recently from moscow that a 10point plan by kohl and 
praised by the state department was fraught with dangerous 
consequences 
french president francois mitterrand has cautioned west germany 
not to push for reunification with ast germany saying it could 
upset the delicate balance in europe 
other us allies also are anxious about the prospect of a 
reunited and mighty germany even though they are not as outspoken 
as the french leader their concerns are partly rooted in the 
devastation of europe at the hands of the germans in world war ii 
a us official acknowledged the kohl plan made a lot of 
people nervous including soviet french and polish leaders 
this is especially so with what is going on in east germany 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
baker will join president bush in a meeting with mitterrand in 
the caribbean island of st martin on saturday 
the west europeans will want to know if reports that baker 
thinks kohl moved too fast on reunification are accurate 
the bush administration has deferred most decisions on german 
reunification to the west europeans at the same time the allies 
would not want to get out of step with the united states on the 
touchy issue

a yearlong scientific analysis of the 
photographs and notes brought back by robert e peary establishes 
that the explorer reached the north pole on april 6 1909 just as 
he claimed the national geographic society said today 
the study was undertaken by the navigators foundation a 
nonprofit organization that had asserted last february that there 
was room for scholarly doubt that the navy admiral reached his 
destination 
the national geographic society sponsored pearys mission and 
has defended the explorers integrity 
the foundation said earlier that a page of calculations made by 
peary offered no evidence one way or the other that page had been 
cited by debunkers who claimed that peary was off course and ended 
his quest for the pole 121 miles shy of his destination 
but in its new report the navigators group said today that 
modern methods of analyzing at which position the sun stood when a 
photograph was taken helped establish the claim by peary that he 
had gotten to the pole 
our analysis of the data peary brought back from his journey 
his celestial sights his diary his ocean soundings and his 
photographs has convinced us that their final camp named camp 
jesup was no more than five miles from the pole the foundation 
said 
to conduct its investigation the foundation compared pearys 
measurements of ocean depths known as soundings with modern 
profiles of the arctic ocean floor the foundation said this 
analysis also supported pearys account 
the foundation based its report on a study of 225 cubic feet of 
papers on the peary expedition as well as other documents 
one of pearys most vocal detractors is dennis rawlins an 
astronomer and historian who in 1988 concluded that peary had lied 
about his location 
suggesting peary might not have reached the pole is one thing 
declaring him a fraud is another said national geographic 
president gilbert m grosvenor in attacking rawlins conclusions

the supreme court today limited the way 
multinational corporations can use foreign tax laws to reduce their 
us taxes a ruling the bush administration said may save the 
government hundreds of millions of dollars 
the court ruled unanimously against goodyear tire and rubber co 
in a case stemming from operations of goodyears british subsidiary 
in the early 1970s 
the british subsidiary of the ohiobased corporation incurred 
net losses in 1972 and 1973 at least under british tax law the 
subsidiarys 1973 loss included british tax deductions that were 
not allowed under american law 
as a result the british government refunded to the subsidiary 
tax payments made there for 1970 and 1971 
the refunds prompted the us internal revenue service to 
recompute the taxes it said goodyear owed in this country 
multinationals are entitled to claim a share of taxes paid by 
subsidiaries overseas as credits against us taxes 
in goodyears case since the irs said american law did not 
recognize the 1973 deductions permitted the company in great 
britain the corporations loss was converted into a profit 
the redetermination had the further effect of wiping out for 
us tax purposes the foreign tax credits previously allowed 
goodyear in 1970 and 1971 
as a result the irs assessed goodyear 791240 in taxes and 
interest for 1970 and 1971 
goodyear then filed suit in the us claims court saying the 
irs erred in applying american law instead of british law to 
determine the companys accumulated profits 
the claims court ruled against goodyear but a federal appeals 
court here reversed the decision last year 
the appeals court said a multinational company is entitled to 
use a foreign nations tax laws to determine accumulated profits 
made by a subsidiary in that country 
the supreme court today overruled the appeals court 
justice thurgood marshall in his opinion for the high court 
said the approach favored by goodyear would lead to unequal tax 
treatment for subsidiaries as opposed to companies set up as 
foreign branches of us corporations whenever a foreign 
government calculates income differently than in this country 
that result would not square with federal laws aimed at assuring 
tax parity between corporations that operate through foreign 
subsidiaries and those that operate through foreign branches 
marshall said 
the justice department said hundreds of millions of dollars are 
at stake even though us tax law was changed in 1986 to bar 
multinationals from using a foreign countrys calculation of its 
accumulated profits for most future tax payments here 
the department said more than 25000 foreign subsidiaries of 
us companies do business in more than 100 countries the 
governments most recent figures show the companies claimed more 
than 9 billion in foreign tax credits in 1982 
the irs said it is reviewing claims for 150 million in refunds 
in such cases 
the case is us vs goodyear 881474

the captain of the uss iowa said today that he 
inherited command of a battleship fraught with problems but that 
he could not endorse the singling out of a troubled gunners mate 
for setting off the explosion that killed 47 crewmen last spring 
capt fred p moosally also told the senate armed services 
committee that allegations of poor training and lack of 
qualifications leveled against his crew imediately after the 
explosion april 19 were unwarranted 
he said he had no information to dispute the navys conclusion 
that the blast was a wrongful intentional act but he said he 
could not conclude that a single individual was responsible 
the navy concluded that a depressed gunners mate clayton 
hartwig most likely caused the explosion by inserting some type 
of detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch 
guns 
navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial 
because all the witnesses including hartwig were killed in the 
blast 
i dont think i could definitely say an individual did it 
moosally said today 
the navys report on the explosion acknowledged deficiencies in 
the way iowa sailors were supposed to be certified to carry out 
their jobs aboard ship but it said these problems did not cause 
the blast 
in the weeks immediately after the blast moosally told 
investigators that he was concerned about the quality of the 
personnel aboard his ship 
he complained that the sailors assigned to the iowa were 
dopers marginal performers constant ua unauthorized 
absences according to published accounts of his testimony to 
navy investigastors 
he has since said he regreted his harsh remarks about his crews 
which he said amounted to an emotional outburst after the tragedy 
asked today about those comments moosally told senators 
you have before you a paradox a tale of two ships one ship 
you read about in the newspapers is a ship of laidback attitudes 
failure and ineptitude the other iowa is the iowa that i command 
welltrained wellmaintained and professional 
moosally said that when he assumed command of the iowa in may 
1988 the ship was fraught with problems including absenteeism and 
drug abuse 
but in 19 months the iowa had become one of the finest ships in 
the navy and when the explosion ripped through gun turret no 2 
it was both a tragedy and the birth of 100 heroes he said 
moosally said the navy inquiry into the blast was generally 
speaking fair 
the captain said he disagreed with some of the charges of 
shipboard deficiencies but when asked if he was aware of any 
information that would contradict the services overall 
conclusions he said initially not that i am aware of 
shortly after the iowa returned home to norfolk va last 
thursday moosally also told reporters he believes the navys 
report on the explosion closes the book on the matter 
but skeptical lawmakers do not see it the same way 
we want a resolution to the problems we want to get to the 
bottom of it once and for all said rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on 
investigations 
that panel has scheduled hearings on the iowa explosion on 
tuesday and wednesday 
among the witnesses scheduled to appear under oath before 
mavroules subcommittee are moosally rear adm richard milligan 
who oversaw the technical and criminal study and kendall truitt a 
sailor on the ship when an explosion ripped through the lowest 
level of the no 2 gun turret 
several analysts from the fbi and the naval investigative 
service as well as outside experts will be questioned 
in announcing his committees hearings mavroules said the panel 
has been reviewing several aspects of the navy investigation 
especially its technical competence and psychological analysis 
the massachusetts democrat expressed concern about a question 
of interpretation of the evidence 
in october mavroules said he seriously questioned the 
navys report and cited an fbi report that said its laboratory 
investigation on the incident was inconclusive 
we didnt find anything that would lead us to conclude that a 
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge the fbi said 
in october thats not to say something wasnt there our 
findings were inconclusive 
in a nov 21 memorandum to members of the subcommittee 
mavroules questioned why the report was described as inconclusive 
i do not see it that way it clearly says they did not find 
elements that the navy technicians said they found why is there 
this discrepancy he wrote 
mavroules also criticized the use of the fbi psychological 
profile of the sailors which was intended to produce leads 
instead it was used as a key document supporting the 
investigation 
despite the skepticism the navy defended its findings in 
testimony before the senate armed services committee last month 
milligan said additional technical tests conducted since he 
issued his report found unique foreign material on the 
projectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have been 
present during a normal firing 
the new tests identified the material as iron wires coated with 
calcium chlorine and oxygen which would be produced by some 
types of nonelectronic explosive devices milligan said

the soviet union today expressed favorable 
interest in a western plan to boost the international role of 
berlin according to a statement from the world war ii allies after 
a meeting in west berlin 
the statement was distributed at the end of a 2hour conference 
of the ambassadors of the united states the soviet union britain 
and france it was the first such meeting here since 1971 
earlier west german chancellor helmut kohl insisted german 
reunification will come one day but acknowledged such a step 
remains a vision 
the meeting was held at allied headquarters in west berlin 100 
miles inside east german territory at the 1971 meeting an 
agreement was drawn up establishing the rights of the four 
countries in the city which has been divided into four sectors 
since world war ii 
the western ambassadors set out their proposals under the 
berlin initiative the soviet ambassador expressed favorable 
interest the allies statement said 
the initiative outlined by thenpresident reagan in 1987 calls 
for improving air traffic to berlin making the city the site of 
youth exchanges and international conferences it also calls for 
holding the olympic games in the city in the future 
during the meeting there was a common understanding of the 
importance of stability and confidence was expressed that the 
united states united kingdom france and soviet union could 
contribute to that on the basis of the quadripartite agreement of 
1971 the statement said it added that further meetings may take 
place 
those attending the meeting vernon walters christopher mallaby 
and serge boidevaix the us british and french ambassadors to 
west germany and vyacheslav kochemasov the soviet ambassador to 
east germany made no comment to reporters 
kohl attending a meeting of his christian democratic party in 
west berlin said we do not know when the day will come when 
this vision of reunification will become reality but i am 
convinced that it will come 
the west german chancellor was due to meet us secretary of 
states james a baker iii on tuesday the meeting had been planned 
for bonn but us officials said the two would meet in west 
berlin baker was flying to berlin later in the day 
at the last four power conference in 1971 the soviets agreed to 
allow unhindered air rail and automobile traffic between west 
germany and west berlin the agreement also cleared the way for 
closer ties between west germany and west berlin 
berlin has been in a turmoil since the communists who led east 
germany for all its 40 years bowed to massive public pressure and 
decided nov 9 to allow free travel to the west 
the berlin wall and east germanys other borders closed since 
1961 to end mass defections were suddenly open 
in the month that followed peaceful popular revolutions have 
ousted old communist regimes from power in east germany and 
czechoslovakia with free elections promised next year 
kohl has proposed a confederation with east germany that would 
lead to eventual reunification of the two germanys east germanys 
leaders have resisted calls for unity but say they back close 
cooperation with bonn 
in the tumult the four powers have been largely ignored 
at least on paper the three western allies have final say in 
many significant issues concerning west berlin 
many west berliners want that to change and the leaders of the 
west german citystate have called for a revision of its status

that is drafting the basic law or constitution for hong kong 
after it reverts to chinese rule in 1997 hong kong accepted the 
proposal after a heated debate the reports said

its capitalistic system for at least 50 years after 1997 and enjoy 
a high degree of autonomy as promised by china in negotiations 
on the territorys reversion

law said last month that china was considering prohibiting 
contacts with overseas political groups

paddy chayefskys the tenth man revived 
sunday at lincoln centers vivian beaumont theater is a savvy 
mixture of borscht belt humor religious mysticism and 
oldfashioned melodrama 
for much of its three acts this fine comedydrama is what used 
to be called a wellmade play those expertly constructed 
entertainments that flourished on broadway until about the 
mid1960s when theater economics skyrocketed and mass audiences 
dwindled for serious drama 
the story set in 1959 the year the play was first presented 
on broadway certainly is a sturdy one a group of elderly orthodox 
jews gather at a shabby storefront synagogue on long island for 
morning prayers but their meditations are interrupted by the 
arrival of foreman a member of the congregation who has in tow 
his granddaughter shes a mentally disturbed young woman he 
believes is possessed by an evil spirit called a dybbuk 
if the plot sounds familiar it is chayefskys play is a 
variation on the dybbuk s anskys drama which has been a 
staple of yiddish theaters in this country since the 1920s 
is the girl possessed or merely insane chayefsky shrewly keeps 
the audience guessinfare for those who like their holiday plays to go on 
as 
long as hanukkah in its eagerness to pander the tenth man 
seems as cynical now as the television programming that chayefsky 
would later attack in his screenplay for network 
howard kissel daily news the evening has moments of power but 
lacks the mystery and tension to make the arrival of the title 
character more than merely funny the overall feeling is closer to 
the amiable leo rosten than say the demonic isaac bashevis singer 
linda winer newsday the play manages to be both quaint and 
vital neatly oldfashioned and modern a curiosity yes but one 
that is loaded with the ornary wit verbal richness and oversized 
heart that characterized his chayefskys most enjoyable work

el salvador may resume diplomatic 
relations with nicaragua under overall proposals at a central 
american summit here seeking greater involvement by the united 
nations in settling the two countries guerrilla wars a salvadoran 
spokesman said today 
oscar santamaria the salvadoran justice minister told the 
associated press in an interview he is optimistic about the outcome 
of the twoday summit by the regions five presidents scheduled to 
end tonight 
last night we clarified various positions and if everything 
goes on like this it is possible that at the end of the meeting we 
may announce the normalization of relations with nicaragua said 
santamaria a member of his countrys delegation 
santamaria said the presidents in principle agreed to issue a 
statement condemning leftist guerrilla attacks in el salvador 
which was part of an allout offensive the rebels launched nov 11 
but he said the statement would not use the term terrorist 
in condmenning the rebels apparently at the request of nicaraguas 
president daniel ortega but santamaria refused to go into details 
other than indicate all five countries are seeking greater un 
involvment to settle the two wars 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani suspended diplomatic 
relations with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government nov 26 
one day after two planes that crashed in el salvador were found to 
have been carrying soviet surfacetoair missiles for the rebels 
meanwhile ortega is seeking agreement to allow un observers 
more power and personnel to start disbanding the usbacked contra 
rebels a source said 
for its part el salvador rejected a ceasefire proposal by the 
leftist rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation front 
whose offensive was the largest of the decadeold civil war 
under the nicaraguan plan the government would consider 
resuming its ceasefire and technical talks with the leadership 
of the hondurasbased rebels after the contra force is disbanded 
the nicaraguan source said on condition of anonymity 
the demobilization of the contras must be complied with 
said nicaraguas foreign minister miguel descoto referring to an 
aug 7 regional peace agreement under which the guerrillas were to 
have been disbanded last week the united nations must begin to 
function in nicaragua 
the source said nicaragua was not optimistic about getting 
contra camps in honduras dismantled because washington wants to 
keep the contras alive to ensure nicaraguas feb 25 presidential 
elections are free and clean 
nicaraguas government insists the presidents follow through on 
their agreement that the contras be demobilized 
a un observer group has been sent to the region to verify the 
contra repatriation and to make sure no weapons are sent from one 
country in the region to anothers insurgents 
the salvadoran rebel ceasefire proposal was presented by 
nicaragua and rejected by the salvadoran government which had 
offered a possible resumption of talks with the rebels if they stop 
guerrilla activities in cities 
the salvadoran guerrillas also asked for the dismissal of seven 
highranking military leaders in el salvador and full respect for 
human rights and democratic liberties of political and social 
organizations 
at the same time costa rica proposed a truce in el salvador 
from tuesday through jan 15 to give both sides in el salvador time 
to begin negotiations for a permanent ceasefire costa rica also 
proposed that the united nations be given powers to verify the 
proposed truce 
the five presidents are meeting for the sixth time in 28 months 
in their search for a peaceful solution to regional conflicts they 
are daniel ortega of nicaragua alfredo cristiani of el salvador 
jose azcona hoyo of honduras vinicio cerezo of guatemala and oscar 
arias of costa rica 
frustration and pessimism prevailed as the summit took place 
amid what arias called the most difficult moment since the 
peace negotiations began 
el salvador accuses nicaragua of sending missiles to the 
salvadoran rebels while nicaragua accuses el salvador and honduras 
of siding with the united states and helping the contras 
the role of the united states and that of the soviet union were 
also brought up at the meeting 
costa ricas foreign minister rodrigo madrigal acknowledged 
that regional agreements will not have much validity if the 
superpowers do not support peace and the conflicting parties have 
close ties to them 
arias who created the regions original peace plan on saturday 
called the united states and soviet union twofaced and accused 
them of speaking about peaceful solutions while encouraging 
military activities 
the united states provides aid to the contras and the government 
of el salvador in its fight against leftist rebels backed by 
nicaragua and at least indirectly by the soviet union

the four world war ii allies still have final 
say over berlin although most of the daytoday administration has 
been turned over to german authorities 
berlin the former nazi capital was conquered in the last few 
days of world war ii by soviet troops 
according to previously made agreements the city was put under 
the joint administration of the four victorious powers the united 
states the soviet union france and britain and each occupied a 
sector of berlin the city itself was inside the overall soviet 
occupation zone 
as the eastwest relations worsened the fourpower 
administration of berlin became more and more impractical 
in june 1948 the soviets blockaded the western sector to try to 
push the western powers out of berlin which was a western enclave 
inside the soviet occupation zone the usled berlin airlift kept 
about 2 million people in west berlin from starving and the soviets 
lifted the blockade in may 1949 
when east germany was founded in 1949 east berlin was 
proclaimed its capital although that violated previous agreements 
that stipulated that berlin would belong to none of the occupation 
zones and that it would retain a special status this special 
status is still in force although the soviets have put virtually 
all control in local hands 
when west germanys consitution called west berlin a state 
within the federal republic the western allies complained it 
violated the fourpower status the allies also emphasized they 
retained supreme authority over the western sector but they 
allowed west berlins integration into the legal economic fiscal 
monetary and social system of west germany 
although east germany and the soviet union tolerated this 
situation for years after the building of the berlin wall in 1961 
the communists started obstructing traffic between west germany and 
west berlin 
in march 1970 the four powers began negotiating over berlin 
recognizing that there could be no relaxation of tensions in europe 
without an agreement over the divided city 
the four power agreement or the quadripartite agreement was 
signed on sept 3 1971 and contains practical steps to improve 
west berlins situation 
the soviets no longer disputed the western presence in west 
berlin and have accepted its ties to west germany including 
bonns right to represent west berlin internationally 
the 1971 agreement also secured and vastly improved west 
berlins land rail and waterway links to west germany west 
berliners were permitted again to visit east berlin and east 
germany and telephone links between the two sides were restored 
but the treaty did not change berlins special legal status and 
the city remains technically under the four powers government 
west berlin technically is not part of west germany and is not 
governed directly from bonn federal laws are applied in west 
berlin under a special procedure 
the allies for instance still control air traffic to west 
berlin and only us french and british airlines are allowed to 
maintain regular service between west berlin and the outside world

government chief cabinet secretary mayumi moriyama said after 
talks between japanese leaders and us national security adviser 
brent scowcroft 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
arrived in japan on sunday after a surprise visit to beijing for 
the first sinous talks between senior officials since washington 
barred such contacts after the military crackdown on studentled 
protests in beijing june 34 
the major western democracies agreed at their annual summit in 
france in july to stop all highlevel contacts with china and 
suspend new credit to protest the crackdown in which hundreds and 
possibly thousands of people were killed 
scowcrofts visit has drawn criticism in the united states 
where chinese dissidents and some members of congress deplored 
president bushs decision to resume highlevel contacts without 
improvements in human rights in china 
the white house explained to us that this was an exception 
and we accept it as such mrs moriyama said i dont think the 
basic us position has changed 
japan was informed in advance of scowcrofts visit to china 
mrs moriyama said the bush administration did not announce the 
trip until scowcroft and eagleburger arrived in beijing where they 
briefed chinese leaders on the ussoviet summit and discussed 
bilateral relations 
the two met sunday night with japanese prime minister toshiki 
kaifu and stressed the importance of usjapan cooperation in 
relations with china 
kaifu said he hoped china would not be isolated from the rest of 
the world but mrs moriyama said monday that japan will maintain 
its freeze on 566 billion in loans imposed following the 
crackdown japanese officials have said there is no timetable for 
resuming discussions on the loans originally to have been provided 
between 1990 and 1995 
japan also has no plans to send a special envoy of its own to 
the chinese capital mrs moriyama said 
japanese business in china has become sluggish with tourism and 
investment plummeting work on at least one major construction 
project in beijing funded by japan has been abandoned 
the chill in sinojapanese relations is not desirable from the 
viewpoint of peace and stability in asia and both countries should 
exert efforts toward their improvement japanese foreign minister 
taro nakayama told scowcroft and eagleburger monday 
nakayama was quoted by japans kyodo news service as praising 
the decision to send the two us envoys to beijing

the remains of a revolutionary priest are to be 
enshrined tuesday in the hallowed pantheon in a bicentennial 
ceremony that has revived 200yearold grievances of the roman 
catholic church against the french revolution 
church leaders are boycotting the event the last planned in a 
bicentennial year in which the archbishop of paris says we were 
invited to commemorate a period when the church was violently 
persecuted 
henri gregoire better known as the abbe gregoire fought 
slavery proposed the abolition of the monarchy and backed a 
controversial oath of allegiance to the state that clergy were 
forced to take 
to close out a year of bicentennial parades exhibits and 
fireworks president francois mitterrand decided to honor the abbe 
gregoire and two other revolutionary figures the philosopher 
condorcet and the mathematician gaspard monge 
a solemn ceremony is planned tuesday evening for the placing of 
their remains in the pantheon a disaffected church in the form of 
a classical temple on the left bank where the french republic 
honors its heroes 
frances roman catholic hierarchy decided not to send any 
representatives although papal nuncio lorenzo antonetti will 
represent pope john paul ii at the ceremony 
the church in france while no longer the antirepublican force 
it once was has not forgotten the revolutions massacres of clergy 
and violent desecration of churches 
the abbe gregoire was a central figure in the drama that split 
the revolution and the church the 1790 civil constitution of the 
clergy which required the clergy to swear allegiance to the state 
many resisted maintaining their loyalty to the pope and relations 
rapidly deteriorated 
the abbe gregoire defended a conception of the church which 
differs from the catholic tradition cardinal jeanmarie 
lustiger the archbishop of paris was quoted as saying in an 
interview in le monde in which he explained the decision not to 
attend the ceremony 
but lustiger said he would preside at an office for the dead to 
mark the abbe gregoires exhumation from montparnasse cemetery 
even though his predecessor as archbishop of paris refused to 
authorize a church funeral when gregoire died in 1831 
the papal nuncios presence confirms the desire of the holy 
see to help france and french catholics heal the wounds which may 
remain from the revolutionary crisis and the antireligious 
violence early in this century lustiger was quoted as saying 
lustiger said he considered it worthwhile to honor the abbe 
gregoire because of his struggle for the emancipation of the 
jews for the rights of blacks and the abolition of slavery 
but he also said the french bishops had tried to maintain their 
proper role with dignity throughout the bicentennial 
celebrations in which we were invited to commemorate a period 
when the church was violently persecuted 
the french hierarchys decision not to participate in the 
ceremony for the abbe gregoire has been questioned discreetly by 
other church leaders 
the absence of bishops at the pantheon will surprise a certain 
number of christians i understand that reaction said monsignor 
jacques delaporte the bishop of cambrai 
the others being honored tuesday are less controversial 
jeanantoine caritat marquis de condorcet a friend of voltaire 
and other philosophes opposed the death penalty and favored 
equal rights for women during the jacobin purge of the girondins 
he was arrested and died in prison in march 1794 in his case the 
transfer of remains is symbolic his body was thrown in a common 
grave and never recovered 
gaspard monge the inventor of descriptive geometry served on 
the revolutionary committee that developed the metric system he 
gave courses in manufacture of cannons and powder for the defense 
of the young republic and later was close to napoleon losing all 
his honors when napoleon fell in 1814

operation while he was bolivias top law enforcement official he 
also hired nazi war criminal klaus barbie to advise his 
paramilitary forces that tortured and killed opposition political 
and labor figures 
a us indictment in miami charges that bolivian secret police 
under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay 
for protection and delivered it to smugglers who did pay 
two of his lieutenants charged in the indictment once received 
15 million for cocaine that was confiscated by bolivian 
authorities and stored in bank vaults according to the indictment 
the indictment says arce gomez personally ordered it released 
he was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged 
with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the united 
states said us attorneys spokeswoman diane cossin in miami 
specifically the charges involved conspiracies related to the 
importation distribution and intent to distribute narcotics she 
said 
a bush administration source in washington said of the 
extradition its happening but refused to give any details 
arce gomez had a reputation for ruthlessnes and for personally 
torturing political prisoners he was named interior minister in

the patient getting her tubes tied on the 
operating table was pulled from a trap near the south platte river 
that morning poking out from under the surgical cloth was her flat 
paddle of a tail 
at the other end beneath the anesthesia mask stuck two 2inch 
orange incisors it took veterinarian david robinson an hour of 
donated time to give the 48pound beaver a tubal ligation and 
hysterectomy 
her mate then was carried in for a vasectomy 
if you dont plan for wildlife in urban areas it becomes a 
nuisance says wildlife activist sherry tippie who initiated the 
sterilization program in response to what city officials say is a 
gnawing problem the rodents appetite for city trees 
to make a dent in their numbers several beavers were caught and 
given contraceptive surgery under the experimental program run by 
the colorado division of wildlife the university of northern 
colorado and the citizens group wildlife 2000 which tippie heads 
if caught a dozen more beavers will get the same treatment and 
some will get contraceptive implants that release antifertility 
hormones over time 
its one of the first times contraception has been tried in 
urbanwildlife management organizers say 
the large rodents live among the factories railyards and 
highways along the south platte river strollers and cyclists along 
a bike trail there were stunned to see program volunteers hoist the 
caged beavers one as heavy as 60 pounds out of the water 
but along the waters edge are piles of branches and sticks 
beavers build as lodges and food caches and also the occasional 
conical stump with telltale tooth marks 
beavers caused an estimated 100000 damage to trees along 
denvers rivers and creeks last year said city parks spokeswoman 
amy pulver 
having urban wildlife is an amenity people go to see it 
children can learn from it she said but trees are an amenity 
too were trying to find a balance 
an ordinance passed several years ago outlaws trapping as too 
dangerous and besides says tippie the general public doesnt 
want animals killed 
her answer a combination of relocation and family planning 
the animals whose valuable pelts lured some of the first whites 
to colorado were virtually annihilated last century to satisfy 
demand in eastern and european cities for beaver hats 
in recent decades the beaver population along the south platte 
and its tributaries has rebounded turning the waterways into 
beaver highways said mark lamb of the state widlife division 
he estimates that within denver alone there are about 75 beavers 
decades of development however reduced the scrubby vegetation 
and cottonwood trees along the river sometimes those trees were 
replaced with more expensive varieties 
the beavers gnaw what they find 
tippie who is nuts about beavers offered to fix the citys 
problem by fixing the beavers 
this summer she lamb and a handful of volunteers including a 
professional trapper caught 46 beavers from evergreen in the 
mountains west of denver to just south of greeley on the 
northeastern plains 
at a cost to denver of 75 per beaver they relocated them to 
rocky mountain national park fairplay glenwood springs and other 
public and private sites where residents were interested in 
reintroducing beavers 
but relocation alone would not reduce denvers beaver 
population if a pair is removed another will take its place 
beavers are monogamous and territorial and will keep the population 
down on their own if they arent moved the two say 
the whole idea of contraception is that males being very 
territorial once theyre sterilized they will also prevent fertile 
males from moving in were using wildlife to manage wildlife 
says tippie 
the sterilization program costs the city nothing robinson 
donates his time as a member of wildlife 2000 
he performs tubal ligations and vasectomies rather than 
neutering the animals so they will continue to function as mates 
and families only unable to reproduce 
robinson puts a transmitter into each beavers abdomen so that 
lamb can track their recovery and any subsequent migrations the 
division and unc biology professor jim fitzgerald in greeley will 
monitor the programs effects on the south plattes beaver 
population

made the request after joining hands with the strikers in seeking

for 15 years members of the free gary 
tyler movement across the nation have sung marched signed 
petitions and put their cause on tshirts and bumper stickers 
this week they hope for results 
tyler now 31 has served nearly half in his life in jail for a 
murder his supporters say he didnt commit 
the louisiana pardon board is expected to announce thursday its 
recommendation to gov buddy roemer on whether tyler should be set 
free the governor has final say 
petitions with more than 12000 signatures have been sent to the 
board and the governor by the committee to free gary tyler amnesty 
international in london and west germany wrote in support of tyler 
said mary howell his defense attorney 
tyler applied to the pardon board in 1980 but let the 
application lapse while he pursued other appeals an october 
hearing was the first the board gas held in the case and the 
decision expected this week will be its first ruling 
in october 1974 tyler a black was in the midst of a heated 
confrontation over the desegration of schools in destrehan a small 
town about 25 miles north of new orleans he was 16 
state police in riot gear were patrolling the streets of the 
town as were members of the ku klux klan 
david duke now a republican state representative was a young 
klan leader who promised to lead armed patrols of klansmen into 
town 
we will help protect white people from rampaging black savages 
and murders duke announced then 
the situation came to a head when destrehan high was closed 
early because of a series of racial fights teachers tried to put 
the 1200 students onto school buses for the trip home 
as whites surrounded buses of black students shouting and 
hurling bottles cans and rocks a shot was fired timothy webber 
a 13yearold white student standing with his mother across the 
school yard fell dead 
an allwhite jury sentenced tyler to death for the shooting the 
sentence was commuted to life imprisonment when the us supreme 
court struck down the states death penalty law 
the conviction has withstood appeals although a federal appeals 
court at one time found enough evidence to say that tyler was 
prevented from getting a fundamentally fair trial 
tyler who turned down a request for an interview on the advice 
of his lawyer always has maintained his innocence 
his lawyer said he was a natural target for authorities 
gary tyler was outspoken he had what was called a smart 
mouth howell told the state pardon board 
support for his cause from famous and ordinary citizens has 
never stopped over the years hundreds ringed the state supreme 
court chanting free gary tyler during a 1976 appeal several 
dozen many of them wearing tshirts bearing the slogan sat 
quietly at the november pardon board hearing 
in 1976 protest marches and rallies were held in detroit 
pittsburgh boston new york chicago and other cities 
pravda wrote about tyler in 1978 calling him a political 
prisoner 
the british reggae band ub40 recorded a song about tyler 
howell said much of the money for tylers appeal has come from 
the committee which he and a core group of about a dozen workers 
reactivated about two years ago 
several hundred tshirts and buttons have been sold in march a 
fundraiser featured local musicians and poets the neville 
brothers headlined another moneyraising concert in august 
a terrible injustice has been done to gary tyler its our 
duty to do everything within our power to set him free said the 
rev avery alexander a state representative the committee is as

an air force delta 2 propelled a 
military navigation satellite into orbit today to join a network of 
spacecraft which tell us and allied military forces where they 
are within 50 feet anywhere in the world 
the 128foot booster blazed away from its launch pad at 110 
pm after being postponed one day because of a problem with a fuel 
tank pressurization system the problem was corrected overnight 
a very smooth flight the rocket is right on track said air 
force lt col ron rand the launch commentator as the delta 2 
climbed toward orbit 
twentyfive minutes after liftoff rand reported the satellite 
had separated and was in a proper orbit ranging out to 11000 miles 
high everything appears to have gone very well with the 
flight he said 
the payload is a 65 million navstar satellite whose signals are 
designed to guide military units such as planes ships submarines 
tanks and land forces with pinpoint accuracy 
four similar satellites all launched from here earlier this 
year are orbiting earth as part of a global navigation network 
the military launch was given priority over another rocket whose 
flight was postponed last week in that case the liftoff of a 
commercial titan 3 rocket carrying a pair of foreign communications 
satellites was delayed thursday night by a computer software 
problem and again friday by stormy weather 
that launch now rescheduled for dec 20 will be martin 
mariettas first commercial one for paying customers

bill webb arrived at his teaching 
job monday wearing his standard flannel shirt and denim pants the 
same type of outfit that got him fired last year for refusing to 
conform to a new dress code 
this time webb had a court order upholding his downhome 
wardrobe 
hes wearing just what he said he would blue jeans and a 
flannel shirt said point pleasant high school assistant 
principal larry martin everythings back to normal 
the mason county board of education fired webb from his job at 
the high school last december after he refused to conform to a code 
that required dress pants and neck ties for male teachers 
kanawha county circuit judge tod kaufman agreed with webb in 
ruling that the dress code is unconstitutional and ordered him 
returned to his job 
school board officials havent given up on their efforts to 
overturn kaufmans ruling but they agreed to allow webb to return 
to work while the state supreme court considers their appeal 
webb 46 who has taught math at the school since 1968 said he 
was a little bit apprehensive about returning to work he 
slipped through a back entrance to the high school without comment 
on monday and principal michael whalen ordered reporters and 
photographers out of the building

to wear dress clothes 
i dont think its right she said i dont think he 
should come to school in his work clothes

said he wears work shirts jeans and boots because dress clothes 
hamper his ability to communicate with students

the prosecution rested today in the 
murder trial of a driver who crashed into a church bus and the 
defense opened its case with testimony aimed at showing that the 
bus wasnt safe 
kentucky fire marshal john william martin testified that the 
seat coverings and cushions on the bus were in fact combustible 
and will burn very rapidly when ignited 
lawyers for larry mahoney contend an unsafe bus is to blame for 
the 27 deaths and multiple injuries in the may 14 1988 disaster 
south of this ohio river community the bus was built before more 
stringent federal safety standards went into effect 
however not all of martins testimony supported that 
contention the fire marshal also testified that dense black smoke 
that rolled through the bus could have been caused by the burning 
of gasoline alone not by the seat covers and he said a protective 
cage around the bus gas tank wouldnt have prevented the fire that 
followed the crash 
mahoney who was driving a black toyota pickup admits drinking 
the day of the crash driving on the wrong side of interstate 71 
and striking the loaded church bus 
he is charged with 27 counts of murder 42 counts of wanton 
endangerment 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving 
the defense phase of the trial is expected to wind up by friday 
last week assistant attorney general paul richwalsky jr 
presented a detailed reconstruction of the accident based largely 
upon weeks of study by kentucky state trooper henry sonny cease 
the jury also heard testimony from relatives of 26 of the 27 
victims from police and a medical expert about mahoneys level of 
drunkenness and from the states chief medical examiner about the 
victims autopsy results 
one survivor of the crash testified that he saw two girls flick 
cigarette lighters to see inside the darkened bus following the 
crash the survivor recalled the fire getting worse the moment the 
lighters were flicked 
asked about that today martin said he didnt believe an 
additional source of ignition would have made any difference if the 
fire had already been started

more than 100000 people rallied tonight in 
leipzig and many urged german unity a proposal that soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev told the new communist party chief would harm 
east germany 
gorbachev speaking with party chief gregor gysi on sunday 
praised the partys rejection of attempts to damage the 
sovereignty of the country the staterun news agency adn said 
gysi became party chief saturday 
also today the four allied occupiers of divided berlin the 
united states britain france and the soviet union held their 
first meeting in 18 years the soviets expressed favorable 
interest in a western plan to boost the international role of 
berlin according to a joint statement 
in leipzig it was the fourth straight week that calls for 
german unity had played a major role in the protests prodemocracy 
demonstrators continue to pressure east germanys beleaguered 
government to carry through with promises for reforms 
we in leipzig and those in hanover a west german city are 
and will remain germans said one leipzig speaker drawing a huge 
roar of approval from the flagwaving crowd what belongs 
together will grow together 
earlier west german chancellor helmut kohl insisted that 
reunification will come one day but acknowledged that for now such 
a step remains a vision 
the questions of east german sovereignty have become 
increasingly important with the growing turmoil in the communist 
nation there have been predictions the rapid changes could lead to 
steps toward unification with west germany 
in his conversation with gysi gorbachev also promised moscow 
would consider providing support within the current framework of 
conditions adn said without elaborating the dispatch also did 
not make clear who called whom 
on sunday tens of thousands of demonstrators braved bitter cold 
in eight east german cities to keep up the pressure for change and 
gysi called for a clear separation of party and government 
prodemocracy supporters rallied in freezing weather in rostock 
erfurt east berlin kronskamp plauen cottbus suhl and ilmenau 
according to adn 
in the southern city of plauen about 15000 demonstrators 
turned out for a prodemocracy rally called by the new forum 
opposition group 
hartmut krausse a physician and member of the new forum 
opposition group told 15000 people in the southern city of 
ilmenau that talk of anarchy chaos and violence was out of 
place 
despite that appeal there was a renewed round of calls for 
people not to resort to violence as they seek to punish discredited 
former communist rulers many of whom have been arrested or are 
being investigated for abuses of power 
mayor wolfgang berghofer of dresden warned sunday that 
violence has not been dispelled an escalation is possible at any 
moment 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany in a 
speech sunday urged east germans to exercise restraint and keep 
protests free of violence 
citizens have been disgusted by the reports of highliving and 
corruption by ousted party officials and in some cases they have 
surrounded or stormed local offices of the oncedreaded secret 
police 
the government has claimed that angry citizens have stormed army 
bases 
in the face of massive protests the communist party in the last 
two months has ousted two sets of leaders lifted travel 
restrictions opened the berlin wall and abandoned its 
constitutionally guaranteed hold on power 
gysi 41 said in a television interview that he backed a 
strict division of party and government but he added this 
cant be done in one day it is a longterm job that is being taken 
very seriously 
such separation would be a striking change in east germany 
where despite recent democratic reforms party members still hold 
most of the important positions in the country 
there have been warnings that a push toward german 
reunification which some recent demonstrations have urged could 
cause further troubles in east germany

to appease moslems who bore the brunt of hindumoslem religious 
riots in the fall

government committee aiming to end separatist campaigns in 
jammukashmir and neighboring punjab where sikh militants are

jammukashmir the only indian state with a moslem majority to 
either become independent or part of neighboring pakistan an 
islamic state

ms sayeed may be released tuesday srinagar the summer capital of 
jammukashmir is about 93 miles north of jammu the states winter

authorities found the bodies of 65 
suspected sinhalese radicals some shot others burned and 
military officials said monday that progovernment vigilantes had 
done the killings 
the bodies were discovered after sinhalese radicals set fire to 
dozens of public buses over the weekend in central and southern sri 
lanka 
the officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the victims were believed members of the peoples liberation 
front an ultranationalist sinhalese guerrilla group trying to 
overthrow the government for making peace overtures to tamil 
secessionists in the northeast 
the front began its campaign in 1987 and has continued to attack 
the government although its six top leaders were killed last month 
by government forces 
on sunday the militants burned 32 governmentowned buses in 
ambalantota about 90 miles south of colombo a government 
statement said 
also sunday at least 16 more governmentowned buses were set 
ablaze in other attacks and two railway engines and a railroad 
station were burned at gampha districts yagoda village 15 miles 
northeast of colombo the government said 
to counter the militant violence human rights groups say the 
government this year set up vigilante groups which have killed 
hundreds of civilians suspected of associating with the front the 
government denies the charge 
the military officials on monday however blamed progovernment 
vigilantes for the killings that were reported since sunday in the 
sinhalese heartland of central and southern sri lanka where the 
fronts campaign has focused 
military officials said 21 bodies were found in wellawaya 
village in monaragala district 100 miles east of colombo most of 
the victims were sinhalese men between the ages 18 and 30 the 
officials said 
they said 18 bodies were found at mavaralla village in central 
kegalle district 11 at southern hakmana town six in the central 
town of kandy and the nine in other towns 
more than 6000 people have died in the sinhalese violence that 
was sparked by an indiasponsored peace accord signed by the 
government in july 1987 with tamil rebels demanding a separate 
homeland for their minority community 
the front alleged the accord too many concessions to the tamils 
who are mainly hindus and comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people tamils claim they are discriminated against in jobs 
and education by the sinhalese who are mainly buddhists and make up 
75 percent of the population the sinhalese also control the 
government and the military 
the sinhalese rebels also opposed the presence of indian 
peacekeeping troops deployed in the north and the east to 
supervise the peace accord india has begun withdrawing its 
soldiers from most areas ahead of a dec 31 deadline but the 
vacuum has resulted in a power struggle among tamil groups 
three tamils were killed late sunday and early monday in 
fighting between two groups the officials said 
at least 10000 sri lankans have died in the tamil rebellion 
that started in 1983 and the postaccord violence

drug lord howard pappy mason was found 
guilty today of ordering the executionstyle murder of police 
officer edward byrne a slaying that came to symbolize the nations 
battle against illegal drugs 
the 31yearold defendant was convicted on all 11 counts of drug 
conspiracy prosecutors charged he had ordered the officers 
slaying in the course of running a drug empire that brought in as 
much as 10000 a week 
he faces a mandatory life prison term when he is sentenced by 
us district judge edward r korman 
the killing of the rookie policemen on feb 26 1988 while he 
guarded a witness in a drug case became an issue in last years 
presidential campaign byrnes parents gave their dead sons police 
badge to thenvice president bush during a campaign appearance and 
bush cited the slaying as an example of why he believed the death 
penalty was needed 
the verdict came in the third day of deliberations the panel 
met for 3 hours friday and a full day saturday before resuming 
this morning 
mason was not present at byrnes slaying two days before he 
had been convicted and jailed for weapons possession 
but prosecutors say he sent word from his jail cell to his top 
lieutenant that he wanted the blood of any police officer 
in his closing arguments friday defense attorney harry c 
batchelder jr countered by saying the governments witnesses were 
admitted murderers drug addicts and thieves who were given deals 
for their cooperation 
byrne 22 was killed instantly by four members of masons gang 
who pumped five bullets into his head as he sat in his patrol car 
guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case 
the killers were convicted earlier this year and sentenced to 
the maximum 25 years to life in jail 
mason hasnt been seen much during his trial which began about

the supreme court on monday made employers 
easier targets for class action agebias lawsuits by allowing 
federal judges to lend a hand in alerting possible victims of 
discrimination 
in a 72 ruling the court let judges help plaintiffs in such 
suits locate other possible victims and seek their participation 
the decision is a boost to workers suing hoffmannla roche inc 
which is accused of bias against older workers in laying off or 
demoting some 1200 employees at new jersey plants 
in other action the court 
refused to reinstate former white house aide lyn nofzigers 
conviction on charges of illegal lobbying after he left the reagan 
administration the justices declined to disturb a federal appeals 
court ruling that overturned nofzigers 1988 conviction 90day 
jail sentence and 30000 fine 
shielded the fbi from having to give grumman corp documents 
received from another government agency narrowing the reach of the 
freedom of information act by a 63 vote the court said the 
documents were exempt from the 1966 law aimed at curtailing 
government secrecy 
unanimously limited the way multinational corporations can use 
foreign tax laws to reduce their us taxes a ruling the bush 
administration said may save the government hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
rejected arguments that iowas mandatory seatbelt law is 
unconstitutional 
disbarred former rep mario biaggi dny from practicing law 
before the high court and took a first step toward disbarring 
former us district judge walter l nixon jr biaggi was convicted 
of racketeering and nixon of lying to a grand jury 
in the agebias case the court said federal law permits judges 
to help plaintiffs locate other possible victims of discrimination 
who may be unaware of the lawsuit and solicit their participation 
in his opinion for the court justice anthony m kennedy said 
judges should have leeway but not unbridled discretion to 
manage class action suits in this fashion 
that serves the legitimate goal of avoiding multiple suits 
in the same case and lets the judge set uniform dates for 
plaintiffs to announce their participation he said 
kennedy cautioned that judges must be scrupulous to respect 
judicial neutrality and take care to avoid even the 
appearance they are endorsing a suit 
chief justice william h rehnquist joined justice antonin scalia 
in dissent 
scalia writing for both said federal law does not authorize 
judges to undertake the unheardof role of midwifing lawsuits 
against employers 
hoffmannla roche dismissed or demoted about 1200 workers feb 
4 1985 in what was dubbed black monday by many veteran 
employees they said a disproportionately high number of laidoff 
or demoted workers were over 40 years old 
a group of older workers sued alleging the company violated the 
federal age discrimination in employment act the groups leaders 
then sought to contact all fired workers over 40 eligible to join 
the lawsuit 
some 400 employees agreed to join but the plaintiffs said they 
believed there might be 200 or more additional workers who were not 
aware of the suit and sought to contact them 
us district judge harold a ackerman ordered the company to 
provide the names and addresses of all fired workers he said that 
once the workers are found they may be sent an explanation of the 
suit and a form seeking their consent to join the court fight 
the form said the judge authorized the mailing but took no 
position on the merits of the case 
increasing the number of plaintiffs in such suits can be a big 
advantage for the workers by helping them spread out court costs 
in seeking workers to join the suit against hoffmannla roche the 
leaders of the court fight requested a 200 contribution to help 
defray the costs 
the stakes also go up for the employer who may be forced to pay 
damages to more workers

former white house aide lyn nofziger won a 
legal victory monday when the supreme court refused to reinstate 
his 1988 illegal lobbying conviction 
that kind of news is always welcome it certainly makes the 
holiday season a bit brighter said nofzigers lawyer lawrence 
barcella 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling that overturned nofzigers conviction on charges he 
illegally lobbied top presidential aides within a year of leaving 
the reagan administration 
barcella said dropping any further prosecution of nofziger 
represents the only humane course but independent counsel 
james mckay declined comment saying he would have an announcement 
at some future date 
nofziger was white house political director from 1981 when 
president reagan took office until early 1982 
he was convicted of lobbying on behalf of three private clients 
the scandalplagued wedtech corp a maritime workers union and 
fairchild corp he was sentenced to 90 days in jail and fined 
30000 
prosecutors said nofziger lobbied for an army engine contract 
for wedtech for the placement of civilian sailors on navy vessels 
and for continued air force purchases of an antitank aircraft made 
by fairchild 
he was tried under the ethics in government act of 1978 which 
imposes a oneyear ban on lobbying former colleagues after a person 
leaves service in the federal governments executive branch 
the ban covered lobbying on any matter in which the lobbyists 
former agency has a direct and substantial interest 
nofziger contended he did not violate the law because he was 
trying to stimulate not influence or exploit white house interest 
on issues of concern to his clients 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled june 27 that 
nozigers criminal indictment should have been dismissed because it 
did not charge him with having knowingly lobbied on matters in 
which white house officials possessed a direct and substantial 
interest 
in his appeal independent counsel mckay said the appeals court 
ruling hampers congress attempt to deal with the spectacle of 
highlevel government officials using the revolving door to turn 
their government service into lucrative lobbying businesses when 
the ink had barely dried on their resignations 
requiring prosecutors to prove a former government employee knew 
the subject of his lobbying was of direct and substantial 
interest to his former agency will reward purposeful ignorance or 
heedlessness mckay argued 
lawyers for nofziger said the appeals court ruling is unlikely 
to have any future impact because of legislation enacted by 
congress in november 
the legislation the ethics reform act of 1989 eliminates the 
direct and substantial interest requirement to create a flat 
ban on government employees lobbying their former agencies within a 
year of their resignations

president bush today defended his decision to 
send two top aides to beijing over the weekend and said he would 
keep looking for ways to find common ground with chinese 
leaders despite continuing unhappiness with their crackdown last 
spring against prodemocracy forces 
bush stressed that the trip by national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and a top state department aide did not amount to 
normalization of relations those who suggest otherwise simply do 
not know what they are talking about he said 
democrats were criticizing bush even as he spoke senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine said the mission by 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was 
embarrassing kowtowing to a brutal regime 
but bush said he took the action because i do not want to 
isolate the chinese people 
the president said the united states maintains contacts with 
several countries that have egregious records on human rights 
as for the crackdown in beijing last june bush said the chinese 
know they have to address themselves to the problems that were 
inherent in this episode 
sanctions imposed by bush after the crackdown remain in effect 
the president made his comments to a group of editorial writers 
gathered in an auditorium across the street from the white house 
he opened the session with a review of his first year as 
president citing an improved ussoviet relationship and other 
developments he said im not overly satisfied but i think 
generally the first year has gone pretty well 
bush said the economy has continued to expand and create new 
jobs and that he had been able to keep my pledge of no new 
taxes 
congress he said has enacted a savings and loan bailout bill 
and made a start on clean air and ethics legislation 
at the same time bush said he differed with the democratic 
majorities of the house and senate over child care legislation and 
would press congress to pass his anticrime package when it returns 
in january 
all in all its been a productive year weve proposed a lot 
of new initiatives he said 
bush said he still planned to attend a drug summit scheduled for 
next year in cartegena columbia despite concerns that the visit 
would pose a security risk 
i dont want to send the signal that nobody should go to 
columbia bush said praising the governments efforts to bring 
the drug traffickers to justice 
he added however that he would reassess the situation prior to 
the trip i will not do anything imprudent he said nobody 
has ever accused me of being too daring 
as for china bush responded with an emphatic no when asked 
if he worried that the scowcrofteagleburger trip would signal the 
soviets that he would tolerate a crackdown on prodemocracy 
demostrators in the soviet union and eastern europe 
i have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly 
positioned in favor of human rights and as long as the soviet 
union knew that we are not sending a signal of quote total 
normalization unquote i will be careful that we do not send that 
signal he said 
at the same time bush said he was very pleased today in the 
wake of general scowcrofts visit to notice that the chinese 
foreign ministry stated that they would not sell missiles to any 
mideast countries he added that scowcroft had raised the issue 
in his weekend talks with chinese leaders and the chinese made 
their announcement before the national security adviser and 
eagleburger had returned to washington 
scowcroft planned to brief bush later today on the trip 
bush said he had sent his top aides to beijing to discuss the 
results of the malta summit with the chinese leaders 
i do not want to isolate the chinese people i dont want to 
hurt the chinese people he said 
i realize the difficulty of this relationshiop but i dont 
want to make it any worse he said referring to the strains 
following the bloody crackdown against demonstrating students last 
june 
he said he was going to keep looking for ways to find common 
ground with china 
the president made no mention of fang lizhi the prominent 
chinese dissident who has been given sanctuary from chinese 
authorities in the american embassy in beijing 
bush spoke against a backdrop of stepped up democratic criticism 
of his decision to send scowcroft and eagleburger 
the administration supports human rights in its words 
mitchell said it does not do so in its deeds these actions 
make a mockery of our profession of concern for human rights and 
are inconsistent with our stated ideals 
the trip was not announced until after the officials had landed 
in beijing at 1 am est on saturday scowcroft toasted chinas 
leaders at a televised banquet and called for improved relations 
this trip was not intended to develop normal relations with 
china in any immediate sense white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said its going to happen over a longer period of 
time we hope but theyre not much different today than it was 
three days ago 
we have the same concerns we have the same indignation we 
have the same principles we have the same urgings for their 
country that we had before said fitzwater 
he acknowledged that the united states has seen no changes in 
chinas behavior since leaders sent in tanks and troops to 
tienanmen square killing hundreds of prodemocracy demonstrators 
and crushing a monthslong protest 
enormous changes are taking place in the world we need 
some uinderstanding of their position on the breakthroughs for 
democracy and freedom in the east bloc nations fitzwater said 
the chinese government has been critical of the changes in 
eastern europe 
the sanctions have not changed its not business as usual 
it simply is the fact we feel china is a country that has to be 
dealt with fitzwater said 
bush former us envoy to china barred highlevel contacts 
with chinese leaders after they sent tanks into tiananmen square 
he also cut off military sales to the communist regime the 
president said relations could not be normalized until the 
government honored basic human rights he also gave refuge to 
chinese students in the united states although he recently vetoed 
a bill that would have written that protection into law 
at the state department spokesman richard boucher declined to 
specify issues raised by the two us officials on their visit but 
he acknowledged that the proliferation of ballistic missiles has 
been and remains high on our agenda with the chinese 
and he noted that chinas governmentcontrolled media termed 
reports of an impending missile sale to syria groundless and 
said china has no plans to sell such missiles to any middle eastern 
country we think its noteworth that they reiterated the 
denials boucher said

it just wouldnt be christmas for 
thousands of south carolinians if ml corley didnt turn his home 
yard and pond into the stuff fairy tales are made of 
a dozen trees in the front yard are abloom with colored lights 
as are the house two bridges leading to the pond and the gazebo on 
an island in the water poinsettias form collars at the bases of 
the trees 
each tier and railing of the white twostory colonialstyle 
home is draped with green garland and wreaths with red bows peek 
out from every window from the kitchen window santa claus and 
mrs claus standing 2 feet tall nod and open and close their 
arms 
the bridges to the pond behind the house also are strung with 
garlands and 6foot candy canes and lollipops stand sentry on the 
bridge to the island 
i dont know whether its elaborate or not but its right 
attractive corely said 
some 25000 people followed homemade traffic signs around his 
circular driveway last year to view the display in this suburb of 
columbia 
two weeks after it went up this year on thanksgiving day a 
traffic counter indicated more than 6200 people had already taken 
the tour which takes visitors from the front of the house around 
to the back yard and pond 
and thats not including the people who just drive by the 
house corley said we get quite a jam here 
the neighbors dont mind the traffic because they do it 
too corley said referring to less elaborate christmas displays 
on his block 
corley 73 began decorating his home in the late 1940s then 
started devoting more time to the display after retiring eight 
years ago from his sawmill and wood procurement business 
now the most elaborate setup might be around the gazebo 
poinsettias spread like patches of fiery snow giant red yellow 
and green lollipops adorn the posts and sides and a lifesized 
santa stands at the back entrance 
despite all the glowing and brightly colored decorations ducks 
still come by for a dip in the pond 
when christmas day draws nearer a friend posing as santa claus 
comes by and hands out candy to visiting children 
corley hasnt even tried to count the number of wreaths 
decorating the property and as for the number of lights i dont 
want to know he said 
i just wanted to thank the good lord that i was able to 
decorate so people could come by and see it he said

a state judge on monday reduced to 
45000 a 1 million award given to a man by a jury that found a 
zen buddhist community next to the plaintiffs property had created 
a nuisance 
the buddhists had placed 200 fluorescent stakes around the mans 
property in pound ridge and used chain saws and other power 
equipment at odd hours 
state supreme court justice matthew coppola agreed the 
wellspring zendo created a nuisance but found there was no basis 
for so big an award 
in addition to cutting the award to 45000 he ordered the 
religious community to remove the stakes and restrict the use of 
power equipment to monday through saturday 8 am to 6 pm he 
also directed the group to close windows and doors before their 5 
am chant 
the jury award was made friday in a lawsuit filed by homeowner 
bradley nitkin who sought 25 million claiming the religious 
community was trying to intimidate him into moving from the 
community in southeastern new york state 
the communitys lawyer douglas hoyt said the ruling would be 
appealed because of the requirement that the community close its 
windows and doors during services which he said was an 
interference with freedom of religion 
i dont think the court has the right to impose such 
restrictions said hoyt we didnt come here just to fight 
bradley nitkin but because of our religious freedom 
coppolas ruling caps a twoyear struggle between nitkin and the 
wellspring zendo community 
nitkin a real estate lawyer claimed the religious community 
had consistently harassed him and his family by clanging cymbals 
and chanting at 5 am he said the group used power equipment and 
chain saws at all hours and on weekends and christmas 
he said he and his wife and 2yearold daughter spend most of 
their time in a new york city apartment even though they had 
planned to move to pound ridge permanently he said monday had not 
yet decided about moving permanently to pound ridge 
freedom of religion had nothing to do with it said nitkins 
lawyer paul robbins the nitkins wanted to enjoy their property 
the monetary damages were incidental 
wellspring is used as a retreat by 20 to 30 people at a time 
the group is suing pound ridge for 65 million claiming new 
ordinances for nonresidential uses in residential areas violate 
their freedom of religion

the holidays are here and for many people 
christmas wont be complete until they get a piece of mail from 
this tiny central wisconsin village 
the us postal service office here is inundated with requests 
for a rubberstamped symbol from the village that stakes claim as 
home of rudolph the red nosed reindeer 
i think its nifty said bruce hayry who is running the 
rudolph post office until a permanent postmaster is found i 
really do its something different 
with a rubber stamper post office workers press a stamp of 
rudolph complete with a shiny nose on mail the stamp measures 
15 inches wide and 2 inches high and is underscored with 
rudolph wisconsin home of rudolph the red nosed reindeer 
hayry said some want the stamps to dress up their christmas 
cards while others want it for their stamp collections collectors 
send stamped envelopes with their addresses to the post office and 
ask that they be sent back with the rudolph stamp he said 
past years requests have come from more than a dozen states 
the idea and original design for the stamp came from lillian 
blonien rudolph postmaster from 1951 to 1971 
the rudolph character was created in 1939 by ron may a catalog 
copywriter for montgomery ward amp co who wrote a poem about the 
famous reindeer a song by johnny marks followed in 1949 and the 
rest is history 
the village has been around considerably longer it got its name 
in 1856 from rudolph hecox the first settler to live there

here is the text of president bushs remarks 
monday to editorial page editors 
president bush well thank you please be seated and thank you 
all for coming i particularly looking forward to this because 
you do represent a unique category of journalism what i want to do 
is just make a few brief comments and then refer take your 
questions for a while 
first just a word on the recent malta visit i think it was 
very promising we agreed mr gorbachev and i agreed to hold a 
summit in the united states next year in june we agreed that our 
foreign ninisters would meet in the soviet union next month 
we are on the brink of exciting new ussoviet relations and 
having said that there are still some difficulties our secretary 
of state is abroad right now talking about some of the problems 
facing europe but basically i end the year more optimistic than 
when i began it and very encouraged about the change thats taking 
place inside the soviet union and all across eastern europe 
on the third world debt question we came up with a proposal for 
solving it the socalled brady plan i want to be sure that we 
move further during next year in terms of implementation at least 
we spelled out some broad parameters in which we with which to 
try to help solve in which to try to help solve the problems of 
third world debt but as one who is very interested in this 
hemisphere i can tell you that there is enormous interest on the 
part of our friends to the south small countries and large that 
we get on with this and that our allies and others private 
banking interests help us get on with this 
on the economy we end the year with a still growing economy 
the lowest unemployment rate in 15 years and 205 million new jobs 
created over the last several years been able to keep my pledge 
of no new taxes for this year and generally i feel pretty 
good about it theres some signs of concern that have been 
expressed from time to time by the fed but i think the main thing 
now is to keep it growing until every american benefits by this 
the longest recovery in history 
and on the ethics package we sent an ethics package up early 
congress did incorporate many of the provisions in our 
governmentwide ethics package into the law passed recently that 
was coupled with the congressional pay raise i think the reform 
was long overdue we didnt get everything we want but we made a 
beginning out there 
on sampls the package which was not easy to come by guarantees 
depositors that money will be safe and sets tough new standards to 
ensure that the crisis doesnt happen again im disappointed in 
some ways with the congress and with our progress or lack thereof 
in some areas 
the crime package we sent a comprehensive violent crime 
control package which proposes augmenting enforcement and 
prosecution strengthening current law restricting certain 
semiautomatic weapons and expanding prison capacity but very 
candidly it has not been acted on so im going to have to come 
back now after the first of the year and try to push on that 
clean air the house and the senate took steps toward took 
some steps toward passing our bill this year but we had some good 
clean air proposals they were widely received bipartisan fashion 
but im disappointed that we havent gone further there 
child care im in a fight with the congress in terms of 
philosophy on child care i want to have as much choice as 
possible we sent up a new major a new childcare bill and 
proposed 250 million increase in headstart this year too and now 
were in the final throes of our budget process addressing these 
questions again but i think youll see some early action on child 
care 
all in all its been a productive year weve proposed a lot of 
new initiatives we i exercised the veto 10 times and to date 
was not overridden on it weve made progress i didnt mention the 
minimum wage for example but i had to hold the line on what i 
though was right and then we did pass it at the level that i 
suggested but i am not overly satisfied but i think generally 
that the first year has gone pretty well

continued violence against nicaraguas 
political opposition would ensure that februarys national 
elections will be dismissed as illegitimate a state department 
spokesman said monday 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government is at a 
crossroads said spokesman richard boucher 
it can hold free and fair elections without violence and 
intimidation and begin the process of bringing peace to nicaragua 
or it can continue to turn the thugs loose on peaceful opposition 
rallies thereby ensuring the election results will be deemed 
illegitimate and that the crisis in central america will 
continue boucher said 
the comments were triggered by a sunday rally by the opposition 
coalition uno at masatepe 30 miles south of managua which turned 
into a macheteslashing riot that left one dead and more than 20 
injured foreign observers blamed sandinista sympathizers for the 
violence 
boucher characterized the provocateurs as a 
sandinistacontrolled mob wielding clubs and machetes and said 
sandinista police and security forces though asked to intervene 
by international observers did nothing to halt the violence 
the opposition a coalition of more than a dozen parties is 
promoting publisher violeta chamorro as its candidate to replace 
sandinista leader daniel ortega as president in elections set for 
feb 25 
one american observer bob beckel said it was clear the 
sandinistas precipitated the riot 
there were rocks being thrown there were boards with nails 
and somebody was macheted to death in front of me said beckel 
former campaign manager for democratic presidential candidate 
walter mondale and an opponent of the us policy of support for 
the antisandinista contra rebels 
and there were bullets being fired so you cant look at this 
incident today and not say that this thing was completely out of 
hand and what the uno was trying to do was have a rally a 
regular old political rally and it turned into a bloody nasty 
massacre 
beckel said one uno supporter was killed by a machete just a few 
feet from him and one woman lost her arm when she was hacked by a 
machete 
i thought id seen some politics in my life but this one 
this was more politics than ill ever want to see frankly he 
said it was very ugly and i think the sad part about it is you 
cant witness what we saw today and believe theres any way 
therell be a fair election in this country 
at the state department boucher called it the latest in a 
string of sandinistasponsored attacks on nicaraguas internal 
opposition since a ceasefire with the contra rebels was lifted 
nov 1 
as an example boucher said a sandinista mob attacked a 
peaceful uno meeting dec 3 at cofradias a village 12 miles east 
of managua leaving 20 people injured including women and children 
the sandinistas promised in signing a regional peace accord 
to hold free and fair elections he said we call on them to 
live up to this promise by ending attacks on the opposition

operations of the detroit news and detroit free press has

public records stated as a director of the parent company of the 
failed thrift the newspaper reported citing unidentified sources 
it said were familiar with the case

i do want to make one comment before taking questions on the 
recent visit of gen scowcroft to china theres a lot of interest 
in that and following the meeting with mr gorbachev it seemed to 
me that it would be appropriate to brief the chinese leaders 
i made clear to them before the malta meeting that i wanted to 
do this i must say i was very pleased today in the wake of gen 
scowcrofts visit to notice that the chinese foreign ministry 
stated that they would not sell missiles to any middle east 
countries that subject was raised by gen scowcroft and in my 
view its a very sound development 
and i do not want to isolate the chinese people i dont want to 
hurt the chinese people we have certain sanctions i hope i 
neednt reiterate my concerns about the events that took place in 
tiananmen square i think we were positioned in the forefront of 
human rights concerns but and i think the chinese know that they 
still have to address themselves to the problems that were inherent 
in this episode 
but i dont want to see that china remains totally isolated i 
dont want to take any further steps that are going to hurt the 
chinese people and i was very pleased that this statement on the 
missiles subject having been raised by gen scowcroft took place 
before he barely hit the ground here there was some discussion 
about the pelosi bill and some political figures accusing me of 
not caring about human rights because i would not sign that bill 
we have enacted by executive order everything that that bill did 
would have done and i want to keep control of managing the 
foreign policy of this country as much as i can and i didnt think 
that legislation was necessary and i hope that the congress comes 
back and takes a hard look at that and then well go forward 
together as we have in the past 
but generally speaking i realize the difficulty of this 
relationship but i dont want to make it any worse id like to 
think it would improve we have contacts with countries that that 
have egregious records on human rights and so i am going to keep 
looking for ways to find common ground but i realize and i would 
say to those who are out there churning around saying that we have 
normalized relations with china that they simply do not know what 
they are talking about 
now i will be glad to take any question yes sir 
q mr president since the malta summit vice president 
quayle has expressed some disappointment with regard to the soviet 
unions activities in central america consequently does this 
reflect the views of the administration or did you pick up at the 
malta meeting some indication that the soviets may be more 
forthcoming and cooperative as our relationship develops 
a well i expressed the views of the united states government 
at the malta meeting that i was concerned about their actions in 
central america and so i think the vice president was reiterating 
a view that he knew i held 
id like to think there would be some some change in their 
philosophy there i had a phone call that i told mr gorbachev 
about from oscar arias in which arias simply asked me to raise 
with gorbachev the question of soviet support for cuba arias 
putting a lot of blame on cuba for the export of revolution into 
these fragile democracies in central america and indeed in south 
america 
so i raised the question very forcefully and i hope that the 
soviet union got the message that it is impossible to have totally 
smooth relations with us as long as they are supporting the export 
of revolution into these democratically elected countries so there 
is no difference between myself and the vice president on this 
matter and he was reiterating really a position that i have 
taken ill try to go from sidetoside sir

q mr president do you think the plo is inspiring or 
orchestrating at least part of the intifada riot activity and if 
so do you think israel should be pressured or obliged to negotiate 
on any more than elections until this violence subsides 
a i dont think israel should be pressured into negotiating 
with the plo is that the question 
q yes 
a no they should not be jim baker is working out a very 
difficult formulation with the israelis with the egyptians under 
which the representatives of palestinian people would sit down and 
talk and it has been very difficult mubarak you remember had 
his 10 points baker came up with five points there has been 
progress on that incidentally but i dont think it is the role of 
the united states to force israel to negotiate with the plo yes 
sir 
q mr president can you envisage any steps the chinese 
government might take that would lead to the lifting of the 
sanctions that are now in place 
a yes but im not going to detail them for you the question 
was can i envisage steps that the chinese government can take that 
would result in the lifting of the sanctions yes and we have had 
an opportunity to discuss that at very high levels in the chinese 
in the chinese hierarchy and i i think it is important that they 
know how we feel on this question as to as to what changes need 
to take place but let me reiterate there has not been 
normalization of relations because gen scowcroft at my request 
and it was my idea my laughing my suggestion went over 
there and had very high level talks in china who had it over here 
yes 
q mr president could you discuss the question of german 
reunification particularly what steps need to be taken 
internationally to deal with that question the helsinki 
conference possibly a second one possibly a peace conference to 
settle borders if you would 
a well i think the helsinki agreement speaks to the question 
of borders and it does provide for peaceful change but it mainly 
recognizes existing borders and that is a given that is a 
position that we respect and that we support what we are not i 
think its very important that the united states not appear to be 
trying to accelerate the change in germany that we not be out 
setting timetables or suggesting how fast this question very 
difficult question for some of german reunification be addressed 
and so what weve done is simply let the process go forward 
we i look i havent been able to predict the rapidity of 
change in eastern germany and if you find somebody that has 
please let me know who that clairvoyant soandso is because i 
dont think there is anybody that has been totally right but we 
put on the table and i dont have them with me four points that 
should guide the question of german reunification but it is not 
it is one that is highly sensitive to the soviet union and we 
dont have to do it just their way it is of some concern to some 
of our european allies but the nato position and the position at 
helsinki guide the us view still on german reunification yes 
q just one followup to that chancellor kohl has made the 
point that helsinki solves it only in a political context and you 
need a peace treaty to deal with the border question in 
international law 
a well eventually i think that you can we can address 
ourselves to that question as you know you have the four power 
occupying provisions but i dont think that its in our interest 
to be setting dates for the finalization of this 
secretary baker is discussing that at this very minute with our 
various friends abroad but the thing and i dont want to come 
out looking like i oppose change from the status quo in the gdr 
but i just dont want to be in the position of trying to accelerate 
the question of german reunification its too sensitive and its 
not the role for the united states to do that sir and then you 
im sorry

an infuriated mikhail s gorbachev clashed with 
communist party conservatives at a tense 10hour central committee 
meeting that included an especially harsh personal attack 
according to accounts surfacing monday 
when the doors opened saturday however the 58yearold kremlin 
leader emerged in excellent shape a participant said with his 
stature reinforced with yet another party post and even the 
conservatives conceded that there were no alternatives to his 
reforms 
there was high drama at the plenary session of the partys 
250member central committee with party officials reportedly 
objecting to everything from the excesses of glasnost to 
gorbachevs kowtowing to the west at one point gorbachev even 
threatened to resign 
nobody argued against perestroika as the only policy capable 
of leading the country and society out of the difficult situation 
where they are now said one central committee member who on 
condition of not being identified by name gave a richly detailed 
account of the strife at the kremlin 
despite glasnost the openness policy instituted under 
gorbachev proceedings in the central committee are cloaked in 
secrecy but some members did talk about the session which even by 
party ideologue vadim a medvedevs account was peppered with 
dogmatic and conservative criticism 
the critics argument was that foreign countries are praising 
us for perestroika consequently our way is wrong estonian 
premier indrik toome a reformer told his baltic republics youth 
daily noorte haal 
the policymaking body convened at a time of unprecedented 
pressure on the party with lithuania two days earlier revoking its 
constitutional monopoly on power gorbachev warned communists their 
comrades ouster in eastern europe shows they must act quickly to 
solve soviet woes 
the truth about which we spoke so often in the past years 
has been reaffirmed once again where there is a delay in dealing 
with overripe problems excesses are inevitable gorbachev said 
in remarks reported by tass 
but the central committee member an avowed conservative said 
highranking party officials criticized a purported surge of 
pacifism and the soviet leaders foreign trips aimed at reducing 
eastwest tensions 
the source said that at one point the balding 59yearold party 
leader from the siberian region of kemerovo alexander g melnikov 
carried away by emotions said something like this is it a 
proper thing to go bowing to the capitalists to go asking for a 
blessing from the pope 
it touched gorbachev on the raw the source said 
visibly infuriated the soviet leader interrupted melnikov and 
reportedly said just a minute we in the politburo think our 
policy is justified but if the central committee has another 
opinion you are welcome to express it and then well decide if we 
should resign or not 
immediately the source said speakers took the floor in favor 
of gorbachev and the 12member politburo and the incident was 
exhausted later he said melnikov apologized for a slip of 
the tongue 
toome quoted in sunday noorte haal said gorbachev told the 
central committee he did not care about remaining in power and 
that his reforms were for the good of soviets not foreigners 
if you really think like that lets discuss it toome 
quoted gorbachev as telling critics toomes remarks in the paper 
were read over the phone by hirv elmar of the estonian peoples 
front in tallinn 
gorbachev ally ivan t frolov editor of pravda and a newly 
appointed secretary of the central committee said the soviet 
leader did not make a serious offer to resign but merely employed 
an oratorical method 
reaffirming his support for perestroika gorbachev definitely 
and emphatically indicated the solidness of this line and his 
personal devotion to it and very sharply said this was the only 
line for him frolov said 
can you interpret this as actually posing a question about his 
resignation frolov asked 
gorbachev emerged reinforced from the meeting adding to his 
posts of party general secretary and soviet president the newly 
created job of communist party chief for the russian federation 
all votes at the meeting except one were unanimous the central 
committee source said 
rankandfile communists rallied in leningrad three days before 
the plenum to support gorbachev against what they predicted would 
be a bid by hardliners to oust him the committee member said some 
sort of attempt at calling gorbachev to account may have been in 
the works but that he staved it off 
i was ready for a shakeup the official recalled in the 
beginning there was really a tense moment when in discussing the 
agenda vladimir karpov first secretary of the writers union 
suggested including the current situation in the country 
that would have turned the plenum into a tribunal passing 
judgment on perestroika but the central committee member said 
gorbachev shortcircuited the proposal 
immediately it alerted everyone as if something really big 
was going to happen and karpov was no more than a pawn in someone 
elses game but at that very moment gorbachev put the motion to a 
vote saying dont these questions we are going to discuss 
embrace the current situation 
only karpov voted in favor the source said that put everyone 
at ease and the plenum proceeded as planned he said 
other party chieftains including leningrads boris gidaspov 
criticized the politburo for reacting slowly to events the greater 
openness in soviet society or kremlins failure to stem 
proindependence movements in the baltic and ethnic clashes and 
separatist drives in the caucasus the source said 
toome told noorte haal about 30 people in the central 
committee want gorbachev removed but said there was no talk 
saturday of replacing him interviewed after the plenum he said 
gorbachev was unbowed by conservative criticism 
the general secretary and president is in excellent shape 
toome said it is evident he will not give up in favor of the 
opposition he has not used all his artillery yet

former corporate executive went on trial monday on charges of 
conspiring to bribe a marine corps procurement officer to help a 
private company get pentagon contracts 
the trial is the second since the governments investigation of 
pentagon procurement fraud nicknamed operation ill wind 
became public 18 months ago more than 25 individuals and four 
corporations have been convicted 
muldoon described in court papers throughout the government 
investigation of defense procurement fraud as a major figure in the 
case is accused along with leonard l ingram of participating in 
the scheme to bribe former marine corps official jack sherman 
this is a case about bribery and corruption prosecutor 
robert dehenzel told federal court jurors thomas muldoon and 
leonard ingram were involved in a sixyear pattern of making 
payments to jack sherman 
dehenzel said that in return for receiving more than 80000 
over the sixyear period sherman helped lee telecommunications 
obtain marine corps electronics contracts 
in addition sherman would modify the contracts to increase their 
value to the company which became a subsidiary of the whittaker 
corp in 1986 
sherman who has pleaded guilty to separate charges in the 
investigation is expected to testify as a government witness 
ingram a minority stockholder in lee telecommunications 
opposed the scheme to bribe sherman argued his lawyer marcus 
topel 
when ingram protested to company officials he was told to 
mind his own business topel told jurors

the scheme in discussions with defense consultants who served as 
conduits for the payments to sherman but ingram privately opposed 
the payments in meetings with company officials topel said 
he is not guilty of the offenses topel said he is an 
innocent man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time 
topel described sherman as being as crooked as the mississippi 
river 
he is on the take everywhere the defense lawyer said 
topel said that scott m lamberth and john franklin van tassel 
both former corporate executives were prepared to testify that 
ingram was not involved in the bribery scheme both men have 
pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing by us district judge

if convicted muldoon could receive up to 70 years in prison and 
be fined as much as 104 million ingram could receive a 95year

q mr president i was interested in your observation about 
chinese missiles and i wondered what makes that different the 
chinese for years when we were so concerned about the missiles at 
the strait of hormuz were denying that they had sent missiles to 
anybody why is this substantively different and why is it 
suddenly important now 
a well because weve represented sir that they ought not to 
be selling missiles into the unstable middle east and for this to 
have been raised now and then having this instant response i view 
that as good 
q but theyve said that before 
a well if they proved to not be telling the truth that 
wouldnt be good but so i think you say whats different 
about it i think the fact that it was raised and then responded to 
with this rapidity is a good sign there are many issues of 
difference that we have with the chinese or potential difference 
and so i think that one does not address itself to human rights in 
china but i think its important i think its important that a 
top us official sat down with china 24 hours later we were told 
this and you know if it works out badly why it wouldnt be 
productive yes maam 
q at a time when a powerful individual such as alfred 
herrhausen can be killed by terrorists doesnt it seem extremely 
risky to be attending the drug summit in colombia i wonder if 
youve reconsidered attending 
a well i im going to take a look at that situation but we 
got a courageous president in mr virgilio barco and i dont know 
that well ill put it this way i dont want to send some signal 
that virgilio barco cannot provide the proper security for three 
heads of state visiting his country i dont want to undermine the 
courageous stance hes taking by my taking a view that would hurt 
what hes trying to do and im sure that if he if the security 
concerns are raised to him that we have a long time before the 
meeting but near the time of the meeting he would agree with the 
objective assessments 
but right now im very hopeful that the meeting will take place 
in cartagena and i have so much respect for him and i know the 
enormous problem hes under from people that want him to give up 
the fight on extradition or fight against the narco traffickers 
and i dont want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody 
should go to colombia because they cant be protected so ive got 
time to take a final decision on that 
i will listen to the experts i will not do anything imprudent 
nobody has ever accused me of being too daring laughter and 
so i will but i dont want to send i dont want to undermine 
this courageous leader sir 
q mr president i was wondering in terms of the german 
question whether you could give us a better more detailed sense 
of your discussions with president gorbachev on that matter and 
also what type of steps the united states with or without the 
soviet union can take to prevent that situation from kind of 
reaching the type of situation you seem to be concerned about now 
a how the us can affect that 
q how the us could do it by itself or if theres a need for 
the us and the soviet union to work jointly 
a well one thing you do is keep from doing imprudent things 
there was a while when i was being criticized for not waxing 
enthusiastic enough some even suggested that it would be 
appropriate for the president to rush over to the berlin wall to 
show his excitement i was excited but i thought it would be 
foolish to go to the berlin wall because you could you could 
evoke a response that would be could have been totally 
counterproductive 
but this is the kind of subject that we can discuss with the 
head of the soviet union but its not going to be determined 
between bush and gorbachev now thats the kind of the spirit 
thats in the past that he and i would sit down and try to 
determine the fate of germany that is not the role that im going 
to play thats not the role for the president of the united states 
and so we will watch the procedures well have the talks that 
youve read about in the last couple of days these fourpower 
talks at an ambassadorial level we will stay in touch so we dont 
miss a signal of some sort but this is a matter for the german 
people to decide it isnt a matter thats going to be determined 
by the united states and so thats the way i look at it and thats 
the way our policy is being conducted now yes sir

q mr president i think it can be said and i think most 
people agree that the events of the last year indicate that the 
cold war has been going our way can we say the same thing about 
the economic competition that weve had overseas and given the 
events that have unfolded in the last few months is your 
administration now going to put more focus on the latter rather 
than the former 
a well i dont know about more focus but were going to put 
plenty of focus on it because you raise a very important question 
the question of fairness in trade and we have tried through a 
very tough and honest negotiator our trade representative carla 
hills to make the point that if were going to go forward with 
these trade relationships weve got to be they have to be fair 
fair trade i have made the point on several occasions to mr 
delors in the ec and to our trading partners in various settings 
with our european friends that the american people are properly 
insisting that the barriers come down 
i remain committed to free trade but its got to be fair and i 
do think we can do a better job of showing our concern about that 
and im going to try to resist protectionist legislation when it 
comes down the pike pure protectionist but the way to avoid it 
is for us to make more progress in the negotiations 
so i think youll see a heightened attention to trade matters 
im going to avoid bashing some trading partner popular though 
that might be in the political arena i think its bad foreign 
policy and i think its bad for the united states as a whole but 
i am not sanguine i am not relaxed about where we stand and i 
will fight hard to have our people secretary of agriculture 
ustr secretary of commerce make progress in all these forums on 
international trade 
i hope that the political changes continue around the world 
thus lessening tensions so that we can put a lot more attention on 
the trade sector i dont want to reply to that part of your 
question that i think that things are so good in terms of the 
change in eastern europe or changes with the soviet union that we 
can totally relax i know theyre not that good with china for 
example yes sir 
q mr president are you not concerned that your warming 
relationship with china may send the wrong signal to the kremlin 
about future possible repression of the unrest 
a no i have no concern about that at all as long as we are 
positioned in favor of human rights and against totalitarian 
oppression and i think we are properly positioned but we have 
as china is a billionplus people they have a strategic position 
in the world that remains important to us 
and id like to think that they will redress some of the 
grievances that continue to exist and as long as soviet union 
knows that were not sending a signal of quote total 
normalization unquote i think theres no risk in what youre 
in your question but i will be very careful that we dont send 
that signal and i think given the recent meeting with mr 
gorbachev i think its very little likelihood of that 
misunderstanding cropping up sir 
q as you know weve just had a very close election in 
virginia and the democratic candidate we think has won we have 
to wait for a recount on that by a very narrow margin and some 
say that he won primarily because of the republican candidates 
rigid opposition to abortion many democrats are very gleeful over 
the fact also that as the berlin wall collapses so will the 
republican party because anticommunism has been the fuel that 
kept the party moving all these years my question to you as 
leader of the republican party are you losing any sleep these days 
over the future of your party 
a no none at all and ive read some of that balderdash out 
there laughter the democrats hold a seat hold a gubernatorial 
seat and they dance around the grave of what they hope is the 
republican party and theyre wrong because the american people 
have not changed their fundamental views that had them support me 
over my opponent 
and so i you know these elections come and go the virginia 
election was a democrat holding the seat of another democrat so i 
dont see enormous amount to rejoice in that nor do i see a 
turning down of the republican party because a mayor in new york 
wins by 2 percentage points over a republican the story is 
please write it down that a republican got 48 percent of the vote 
in new york city and so i dont i dont accept all that and i 
know theres a lively debate on some of these social issues but i 
also know that we are getting credit as a party for handling i 
hope properly some of the changes that are taking place in the 
world and having a global vision and trying to do at home those 
things that the american people want i cited some of my 
frustrations but i also cited some steps that have gone reasonably 
well but i think we have a sound agenda a national agenda and i 
think that will benefit the party in the future so for those who 
want to read something into virginians holding onto the 
gubernatorial seat thats their pleasure but i havent lost a 
wink really yes

secretary of state james a baker iii 
cautioned west german leaders monday that they alone cannot decide 
the pace of reunification with east germany 
baker flew here for talks with chancellor helmut kohl and 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and a visit to the 
nowporous berlin wall after a stop in london 
there he reaffirmed a special us relationship with the 
government of prime minister marager thatcher and said he did not 
believe the two close allies were drifting apart 
i dont think there are any fences that need mending baker 
said after a 50minute conversation with mrs thatcher at no 10 
downing st we feel a special relation to the united kingdom and 
to the prime minister 
he said there had been some minsuderstanding of president 
bushs call at a meeting of nato leaders on dec 4 in brussels for 
perhaps even an intensified effort at economic and political 
integration of western europe 
mrs thatcher has resisted most moves in that direction but 
gone along reluctantly overriding her objections the european 
community on saturday made steps toward creating a central bank and 
a common currency for the 12nation region 
i dont think the differences were as real as they were 
portrayed in the british press baker told reporters later as he 
flew to west berlin 
besides he said the united states does not take a position on 
the pace of integration because it is not a member of the european 
community 
but baker then went on to offer some pointed advice to kohl 
whose 10point program for german reunification has raised concerns 
in the soviet union france britain poland and elsewhere in 
europe 
baker said the four world war ii allies who have final say in 
running berlin have roles and responsibilities that must be 
respected in deciding the countrys destiny 
there has never been any peace treaty signed between the 
allies and germany and there are certain retained rights which the 
four powers have baker told reporters 
he cited as an example access to berlin by the four wartime 
powers the united states the soviet union britain and france in 
that regard baker recalled former president ronald reagans call 
for improved air service 
so there are some reserve roles and responsibilities there 
baker said 
asked if the germans would require the concurrence of the four 
powers to reunite the country baker said that was a legal question 
that would keep us and other foreign ministries busy 
but when asked for the us policy position he said there is 
a certain reserved role and certain responsibilities reserved under 
the allied powers that have got to be considered when you deal with 
the question of german reunification these things have to be 
considered and dealt with 
baker will have breakfast with kohl on tuesday ceremonially 
sign the citys golden book and make a lowkey visit to the berlin 
wall the concrete cold war symbol of eastwest division 
millions of east germans have passed through the wall in the 
month since the communist government lifted travel restrictions 
baker then will make a speech to the berlin press club in which 
he is expected to elaborate on his theme that german reunification 
should be anchored to the north atlantic treaty organiyation the 
european community and the 1975 helsinki agreement signed by 32 
european countries the united states canada and the vatican 
he said the bush administration would like to see reunification 
develop in a peaceful and productive way 
working together with all of our allies and that includes the 
federal republic of germany france and the united kingdom and 
taking into consideration the concerns of germanys neighbors we 
can have influence on the process baker said 
he agreed with a reporters suggestion that the upheaval in east 
germany comes partly from the streets and may not be manageable by 
the superpowers 
but we are doing i think what we should be doing and what 
is responsible under the circumstances baker said

a kankakee county board member was charged 
monday with murder and arson in the deaths of his three children 
and a fourth youngster in a fire at their mothers home 
authorities said 
bernon i howery 38 in his second term on the board was 
ordered held without bond on four charges of firstdegree murder 
and one of aggravated arson police chief timothy o nugent said 
during questioning mr howery implicated himself in the cause 
of this fire nugent said declining to elaborate 
the case is to go to a grand jury friday said assistant states 
attorney brenda gorski howery is scheduled for arraignment dec 18 
the bodies of justina howery 5 her sister prima 10 their 
brother joel 9 and halfsister ledonja walls 11 were found 
early saturday in an upstairs closet a short time after fire 
engulfed their mothers home in this community of 31000 about 60 
miles south of chicago 
the fire appeared to have been started in piles of clothes 
placed at several locations in the house according to police lt 
william cantrell 
fire chief james dupuis said investigators were still trying to 
determine if an accelerant had been used 
all four children were left friday evening by their mother 
linda walls in the care of her 27yearold brother johnny walls 
who lives with her and the children cantrell said 
later in the evening howery visited and walls left cantrell 
said later howery also left to run an errand leaving the 
children unattended cantrell said 
authorities believe the fire was started before howery departed 
nugent said 
firefighters found no sign of a smoke detector in the house and 
considered it odd that the children had not broken an outside 
window in the walkin closet where their bodies were found 
cantrell said 
breaking the window would have saved their lives he said 
authorities backed off sunday from their allegations that two of 
the children may have been sexually molested before they died 
kankakee county coroner james orrison said autopsies gave no 
indication of sexual molestation he said high levels of carbon 
monoxide found in the childrens blood confirmed earlier 
speculation that the victims were alive at the time the fire 
started and died of smoke inhalation

sequoia and kings canyon 
national parks which adjoin each other in the sierra are the 
first to resume a policy of letting some lightning fires burn 
themselves out officials said monday 
a national park service policy to let selected fires burn 
naturally was suspended last year following criticism over letting 
wildfires get out of control in yellowstone national park 
the suspension has been lifted only at sequoia and kings canyon 
following approval by regional director lew albert of a revised 
fire management plan for the parks 200 miles north of los angeles 
said spokesman william tweed 
based on an environmental assessment albert found that resuming 
the policy would have no signficant environmental impact 
fires will be allowed to burn only within specific ranges of 
temperature wind speed and fuel moisture tweed said enough 
firefighters must be on hand to put a fire out if necessary 
the goal of the program is to perpetuate the role of natural 
fire in park ecosystems without threatening public safety or 
property tweed said in a statement

they began thanksgiving day at the cathedral of st paul

participate in said rene hurtado a salvadoran refugee leading 
the protest by ending the hunger strike we are allowing 
everybody to participate with us in fighting to stop military aid

gov rudy perpich us house speaker thomas foley and us rep 
gerry sikorski dminn

that would greatly stress their systems 
on sunday perpich and sikorski attended a nondemoninational 
prayer vigil at the church that drew more than 3000 participants

the issue sikorski said the strikers strengths were needed to 
continue working toward resolving the issue

fast and promised that military aid to el salvador would be a 
major issue when congress reconvenes next month

q mr president in your inaugural address you called for a 
higher level of cooperation between the executive and legislative 
branches and i was wondering in the past year i realize the 
house leadership had some unexpected turmoil but have you been 
pleased distressed surprised by the character of white 
housecapitol hill relations 
a well being somewhat of a realist i cant say i was 
surprised but and there have been some negative highly partisan 
comments i pride myself on the fact that i dont believe anybody 
can point to a personal observation on the negative side by me 
about any of the democratic leaders and im going to continue that 
way and i try to debrief them when we come back from malta i try 
to give them a preview and ask for their advice before i go to 
malta we talk about these domestic issues in a very open way with 
the leaders and im going to continue that 
and i think in some ways thats been good ive taken some 
flack on board from some in our own party for doing that too much 
for trying to work with the democrats but i was elected to make 
certain things happen and im going to continue to try to make 
certain things happen i cited an unfulfilled agenda here but i 
if i had to sum up my feelings at the end of the year id say 
there are some frustrations but im determined when the congress 
comes back to hold out the hand and try again we have good 
relationships with the speaker and the senate side reasonably 
good and so were going were going to keep working on that 
but it thereve been some good moments and thereve been some 
enormous frustrations i guess is the way to wrap it up yes sir 
q mr president how likely is it for jennifer casolo to 
receive a fair trial in el salvador given the breakdown of law and 
order in that country and also given the initial remarks that came 
out of the white house when she was arrested 
a well i think its essential that she receive a fair trial 
and i have instructed our ambassador and indeed talked to 
cristiani personally to represent to the salvadorans that its 
essential that a fair trial be granted and having said that i am 
satisfied so far that that will take place but it is essential 
that it not only take place but that it have all the appearances of 
fairness and i think thats what mr cristiani is determined to 
do so i dont that one is is is very complex but so far 
ive seen no indication that she will not receive a fair trial 
i have expressed my own concern about the fmln shooting up 
civilians and shooting up going after a democraticallyelected 
government that was elected in certifiably free elections and i 
think when oscar arias calls and urges that the soviets intervene 
to see that this kind of thing doesnt go on it makes an 
impression on me but we ought to separate these cases and just do 
everything we can to insist that whoever it is be granted a fair 
fair hearing and a fair trial and i hope that will be the case 
in jennifer casolo yes sir 
q cincinnati being the home of marvin warner and charles 
keating weve got quite an interest in the sampl crisis you 
mentioned in your remarks that you saw the fact that the sampl 
package guaranteed depositors their money as being a positive 
however some are suggesting that the fact that that maximum level 
of insurance is so high its part of the problem and i was just 
wondering what your thoughts were on that 
a on deposit insurance 
q the maximium level of insurance 100000 on depositors 
insurance being part of the reason for some of the problems with 
lincoln savings and so forth 
a i i just i dont want to dodge your question but i dont 
know enough about the specifics in that case to give you an opinion 
as to whether the 100000 limit on savings deposits affected it or 
not all i do know is weve got to clean it up and its a whale of 
a a whale of a mess and well see where we go but we had this 
one refinancing i am now told that that might not be enough and 
whether you can attribute it to your question or now i am 
embarrassed to say i just dont have a good answer for you yes 
sir way in the back

a man charged with murdering 27 people in 
a bus crash hadnt been drinking heavily the day of the accident 
relatives and a friend testified monday as the defense opened its 
case 
also testifying was kentucky fire marshal john william martin 
who said a smoky fire that engulfed the church bus still would have 
occurred if the vehicle had been equipped with a protective cage 
around its gas tank 
the defense maintains that larry mahoney was not drunk when his 
pickup slammed into the bus on may 14 1988 and that the 27 
victims were killed because the bus was unsafe 
mahoney admits drinking the day of the crash driving on the 
wrong side of interstate 71 and striking the loaded church bus he 
is charged with 27 counts of murder 42 counts of wanton 
endangerment 12 counts of assault and a count of drunken driving 
defense attorney william summers asked martin if a protective 
cage around the gas tank might have prevented the fire that 
followed the crash police say the gas tank was punctured by a 
piece of the bus front suspension after the collision 
its my opinion it would not have prevented the puncture in 
this case martin said 
the fire marshal also testified that plastic seat covers and 
cushions in the bus were combustible but later added that the 
smoke that filled the bus might have come from the burning gasoline 
alone 
the former school bus built in 1977 before more stringent 
federal safety standards went into effect had been sold as surplus 
to the first assembly of god church 
following the crash martin issued a report recommending that 
new school buses be designed with diesel engines additional 
emergency escape doors and windows and with gas tanks in the 
center rather than on the side 
the defendants mother son and best friend followed martin to 
the witness stand all testifying that mahoney was not drunk when 
they saw him the day of the accident which occurred just before 11 
pm 
anthony mahoney 17 testified that he didnt see his father 
drink nor did he seem intoxicated when he left their trailer at 
about 1 pm 
mary mahoney said her son wasnt drunk and didnt consume any 
alcohol when he visited her at about 430 pm 
mahoneys best friend dennis mefford testified that he thought 
mahoney had been drinking but was not intoxicated when he visited 
meffords house at about 630 pm 
mefford described mahoney as a moderate drinker who finds that 
hard liquor bothers his stomach he said mahoney drank one can of 
beer while eating pizza and then left with another can 
the defense is expected to complete its phase of the trial by 
friday it remained uncertain whether mahoney would testify

students have turned the tables on 
the secret police and are keeping 24hour watch on state security 
headquarters 
three students hovered close to the entrance of the police 
headquarters on bartolomejska street on monday serving their time 
on the front lines in a psychological war against the despised 
security force 
for decades the shadowy force known as the stb threatened 
blackmailed and used every means imaginable to control and silence 
citizens 
a network of vicious spies and informers the stb wove a web of 
phone taps and bugs and cameras set up on street corners throughout 
prague 
but everything in czechoslovakia has suddenly been turned upside 
down and those who not long ago were behind bars as dissidents are 
now leading the nation as ministers 
jiri dienstbier and jan carnogursky two former dissidents on 
sunday became members of the cabinet and carnogursky joined a 
threeman commission overseeing the police once interrogated they 
now will have some questions of their own 
student leaders warn that when the locked drawers are finally 
opened thousands of incriminating files may be missing 
in the moravian town of brno students began keeping an eye on 
police friday after accusing them of burning documents in a nearby 
forest a charge reported by the state news agency ctk 
to say openly what they may be trying to do is the greatest 
danger to a group that operates in secrecy said student 
spokeswoman monica bajerova every citizen will be watching 
the surveillance in brno and here is part of the pressure we 
want to put on to keep the secret police under control she said 
but the police plead innocence 
jiri bitcanek chief of uniformed police for central bohemia 
denied in an interview with western reporters that any documents 
have been removed from his office trouble is bitcanek only took 
the job four days ago his predecessor abruptly found a new career 
bitcanek voluteered to interview in place of the head of secret 
police he said he did not know who was now head of the furtive 
force since the former chief was removed last week 
he confessed that morale among his comrades has hit a new low 
and that the force is in shambles 
you have to realize that this is a corps set up along military 
lines and that right now we are not receiving any orders he 
said while chanting from a small street demonstration drifted 
through his office window 
bitcanek said police especially secret police were only 
following orders from the communist party hierarchy now theyre 
being held responsible 
i went down to talk to the students when they came on friday 
they photographed me bitcanek complained they were taking 
pictures of every person who came in or out of our building 
i asked them to stop i dont havu any guarantee that a 
picture of a policeman in this emotionally charged psychotic 
atmosphere will not be used against the agent or his family he 
said 
the police who are estimated to number over 100000 are just 
the latest security force to come under citizen attack 
on dec 2 the communist party disarmed its paramilitary force 
the peoples militia on dec 7 defense minister miroslav vacek 
gave his assurance to opposition leader vaclev havel that the army 
estimated by western experts at 145000 would never be used 
against the citizens 
despite such assurances many czechoslovaks suffer the psychic 
scars of the last 40 years and are finding it hard to shed their 
fears 
they remember philosopher jan patocka the guiding spirit of the 
human rights group charter 77 who died after eight hours of police 
interrogation 12 years ago 
we are still nervous said a 32yearold writer who 
requested he not be identified maybe we are demanding too much 
too fast will the secret police stand for this 
a student in front of the station on monday said they didnt 
have any choice now its not the soviets it is the people who 
are here

q it sometime seems that missing from your agenda i mean 
from your comments today has been anything relating to the 
problems of american cities particularly the problems of urban 
poverty and it leads to an inclination to think that perhaps you 
dont think these problems are amenable to a federal initiative is 
that correct 
a no thats incorrect i though child care had a lot to do 
with that i thought the question of anticrime legislation has a 
lot to do with that because those areas are the most severely 
impacted but im glad you raised it because it is totally 
incorrect yes sir i also mentioned the creation of jobs 
thats very important to the inner cities yeah go ahead 
q as we await your next budget for next year there is some 
anxiety that there may be another round of cuts in human and 
domestic services for example the legal services corp where you 
recently offered a recess appointment for a new chairman can you 
give us some assurances that the kinder gentler administration 
will have adequate funding for human services 
a i think youll i think youll be pleasantly surprised when 
you take the overall budget and its concerns for city affairs for 
human affairs whatever 
q inaudible 
a well i cant i dont know the exact levels on legal 
services were in the final processes of budget right now i go 
from this meeting to another marvelous meeting with dick darman 
laughter and big thick notebooks over there so i am not 
ducking it i just dont know the answer but generally speaking i 
think youre going to find that we are able to finance the 
initiatives that i talked about some of which i mentioned here 
that do affect the human the welfare of the american people 
particularly those that are disadvantaged yeah last two one 
two 
q mr president could you tell us when a decision will be 
announced on the relocation of the southern command in panama 
a no sir i dont know im not ducking it i just dont know 
the answer aside does anyone can anyone help with that bob 
staff no sir 
a cant i know people in san antonio have a keen interest in 
this 
q yes very keen 
a and i can understand why but i just dont know the answer 
to that one yes last one 
q there have been widely divergent accounts this morning of 
the credibility of a witness to the murder of those priests in el 
salvador is it not time to go public with that investigation and 
if not now when 
a a widening a widely 
q we have a report 
a as to whether shes a credible witness or not 
q yes we have a report out of el salvador that she had flunked 
lie detector tests we have other reports from the clergy in el 
salvador that shes being brainwashed could you respond to that 
a yeah i can respond to the last part of it and because 
when i read that i looked into that and i am and i am assured 
that is not the case but i think youre you ask a good question 
as to when all this will become public it should be and id like 
to see it as soon as possible but there are some i think there 
are some concerns and all i would say is that this she was 
accompanied by a person from the us embassy i believe the 
justice department has had a had the custodianship or taken a 
keen interest in all of this and i have confidence that our 
attorney general would not permit the kind of inquisition process 
that was alluded to in the papers today 
and so it is very important just as in the casolo case that 
this be resolved fairly and to the satisfaction of the american 
people and that is going to mean the disclosure that youre that 
youre asking about and so i want to i want to just assure you 
that this will this will take place i think its important that 
its done in a way so theres no you know not tampering with 
evidence but prejudicing the legal proceedings that are taking 
place i think thats very important 
q well will you order the fbi to make its investigation public 
in the reasonably near future 
a well ill do it in within the confines of the legal 
proceedings i dont want to i dont want to order them to do 
something and then have them say the very fact youve done this is 
making it difficult to get a reasonable solution to the question 
everybody is asking what happened 
but i think in fairness to her ive already guaranteed to my 
satisfaction that she is not being mishandled and i dont think 
that people would tell me something thats not true there because 
there would be a price to pay for that 
thank you all very much thank you

a twohour general strike called by human rights 
activist andrei d sakharov appeared to fizzle monday with only 
about 1500 participants reported in moscow and scattered support 
around the country 
scientists at research institutes were the main workers in the 
capital to heed the strike call to demand an end to communist party 
domination an aide to the nobel peace prize laureate said 
there was little exact information about strikes elsewhere but 
sakharov aide alexander sobyanin said his office received about 100 
telegrams from soviet workplaces where walkouts took place and knew 
of about 1500 scientists who took part 
ivan t frolov editorinchief of pravda said the strike 
apparently didnt happen 
i think it would be hard to imagine that in these conditions 
after all weve lived through and are living through that this 
poorly thoughtout strike call could meet understanding among the 
public he told a news conference at the party newspapers 
offices 
strikes have ravaged the struggling economy since summer and 
officials now warn that citysupplied steam heat could be affected 
by a coal strike in an already bitter russian winter 
sakharov and other parliamentarians called for the strike to 
pressure the congress of peoples deputies to vote on rescinding 
article 6 of the constitution which guarantees the communists the 
leading and guiding role in society they also want the 
congress which opens tuesday to act on several key reform laws 
sakharovs move failed to win the support of a group of 400 
progressive parliamentarians the interregional group voted sunday 
to favor the goal of rescinding communist supremacy but did not 
throw its influence behind the call for a general strike members 
said the public mood was too explosive 
random checks of factories in moscow bore out frolovs claim 
that the strike failed to materialize 
sobyanin said despite the limited participation in the walkout 
a permanent moscow strike committee was being formed in case the 
need arose for a walkout 
a highly successful twohour strike nov 27 preceded 
czechoslovakias recent decision to drop its version of article 6 
from its constitution and hungary poland and east germany have 
done away with their equivalents of the clause as one after the 
other moved away from communist oneparty rule 
in the baltic republic of latvia some store clerks and 
transport workers called a halt for just 15 minutes to show their 
solidarity with sakharovs call said maris melans of the popular 
front newspaper atmoda 
lithuanias popular front called sajudis saw no reason to 
strike since its parliament voted last week to drop its version of 
article 6 and legalize a multiparty system said spokesman 
gintautas alyksenes as a sign of solidarity with sakharovs call 
however sajudis called for a minute of silence he said 
estonias popular front decided not to join the strike even for 
two hours because we have such terrible economic conditions it 
would make peoples lives worse said spokesman paul lepp 
estonias parliament is expected to follow lithuanias example 
throwing out its version of article 6 and legalizing multiple 
political parties within a month lepp said 
for all practical purposes its already removed he said 
although only the democratic party of labor of estonia called 
itself a political party in sundays elections many other 
political movements fielded candidates lepp said 
soviet tvs nightly news program vremya like other soviet 
media carried nothing monday on the strike

military officials said monday that 
hundreds of soldiers who launched the failed coup attempt are still 
at large and president corazon aquino called for tougher search 
and arrest measures 
mrs aquino also said her governments position in talks on a 
new lease for us bases has not been compromised by the role us 
warplanes played in helping put down the rebellion that officials 
say killed 113 people 
military officials said they cannot account for more than half 
of the soldiers who launched the coup attempt dec 1 in the most 
serious bid by troops to topple mrs aquino rebels in cebu city 
surrendered their last known position to government forces saturday 
brig gen oscar florendo chief of the militarys civil 
relations service said 1485 rebel troops including 128 officers 
have surrendered the military estimates about 3000 soldiers 
joined the coup attempt and the whereabouts of many rebels 
remained unclear 
florendo said in addition to 113 deaths the coup attempt left 
581 people wounded 
on wednesday mrs aquino declared a nationwide state of 
emergency to cope with the crisis she said monday she wanted 
congress to grant special powers to search for weapons and 
ammunition without the normal legal constraints 
she also said the administration would ask congress to extend to 
72 hours the length of time a suspect can be detained without 
charge the law requires that suspects be charged within 12 to 36 
hours of arrest depending on the severity of the crime 
as a sign of concern share prices tumbled 8 percent in nervous 
trading on the manila stock exchange on monday the first day of 
trading since the coup attempt was launched 
at a news conference mrs aquino was asked whether she was 
considering a cabinet shakeup after the coup attempt 
i believe that by the end of the year we will already know who 
we will probably change she said 
mutineers had demanded that mrs aquino and her government 
resign in favor of a civilianmilitary junta many political 
commentators also have urged changes in the cabinet because of 
inefficiency in government 
mrs aquino said the bases issue was not discussed when her 
government asked the united states through ambassador nicholas 
platt to provide air cover for loyal forces 
on dec 1 the first day of the coup attempt us f4 phantom 
jets based in the us clark air base north of manila provided air 
cover for loyal troops fighting rebel forces who bombed the 
malacanang presidential palace and occupied three military bases 
the talks on the future of the six us military facilities in 
the philippines whose lease expires in 1991 were set to begin 
this month but are expected to start in january or february mrs 
aquino said 
defense secretary fidel ramos said at a separate news conference 
that the flights by us warplanes could have a positive effect on 
the talks he said the jets did not fire on rebel positions as 
claimed by opposition politicians 
in my view the forthcoming exploratory talks between two 
governments would be affected in a positive way by that giving of 
assistance in a very welldefined manner nobody went out of 
bounds ramos said 
also on monday opposition sen juan ponce enrile said mrs 
aquino cannot prove she was elected president of the philippines 
and should resign 
enrile the former defense minister said mrs aquino has no 
evidence that she is the duly elected president of the philippines 
if there is anybody who should lead the resignation of national 
officials of the land it should be mrs aquino 
enriles claim reflects the opinion of a clique of military 
officers who triggered the february 1986 people power 
revolution against thenpresident ferdinand marcos but who then 
turned against mrs aquino and have tried to overthrow her 
the 1986 uprising began after enrile and military allies 
mutinied against marcos following a fraudtainted presidential 
election no independent vote count was ever completed 
enrile said he would refuse to cooperate with a presidential 
commission investigating whether he took part in the latest coup 
attempt he has denied involvement he was fired as defense 
minister on nov 26 1986 after a failed coup by his followers

homelessness aids and crack cocaine are 
overwhelming child welfare services nationwide and are contributing 
to a growing number of children in foster care a congressional 
report said monday 
the report issued by the democratic majority on the house select 
committee on children youth and families said federal funding for 
major childrens services especially those designed to keep 
children in their homes has not kept pace with the problem 
this is ronald reagans legacy to the 1990s rep george 
miller dcalif committee chairman said at a news conference 
this was the prescription for the 1980s and its been a complete 
disaster 
social workers cannot keep up with huge caseloads and children 
are being placed on waiting lists rather than given services he 
said 
it means we are devastating hundreds of thousands of children 
these children are becoming candidates for longterm dependency 
on our social welfare system miller said were really talking 
here about he candidates school for future penetentiary 
residents 
the report estimates that the number of children placed in 
foster care juvenile detention centers and mental health 
facilities has grown to nearly 500000 and could reach 840000 by 
1995 
the report said its survey of 11 large states showed the number 
of children in foster care dropped by 9 percent between 1980 and 
1985 however the number rose 23 percent between 1985 and 1988 
while federal funding for child welfare services aimed at keeping 
children in their homes rose 7 percent according to the report 
the number of children in public and private juvenile detention 
centers rose 27 percent from 1979 to 1987 as funding under the 
juvenile justice and delinquency prevention act declined from 100 
million in fiscal 1979 to 667 million in fiscal 1989 the report 
said 
the number of children in mental health facilities soared 60 
percent between 1983 and 1986 the report said federal block 
grants for mental health services provided 503 million to the 
states in fiscal 1989 17 million less than the sum of programs 
consolidated into block grants in 1981 it said 
the states surveyed were california florida illinois 
michigan missouri new jersey new york north carolina ohio 
pennsylvania and texas 
among the reasons cited for the increases in foster placements 
and detentions was drug and alcohol abuse the number of babies 
born drugexposed reached 375000 in 1988 a number that has 
quadrupled in the last three years the report said 
it also said reports of abused or neglected children rose 82 
percent to 22 million between 1981 and 1988 also requests for 
shelter for homeless families rose 18 percent from 1987 to 1988 
said the report citing a us conference of mayors report 
republicans on the committee disputed the democrats projection 
that outofhome placements for children will jump 73 percent over 
the next five years they took issue with the reports methods of 
calculating the projection and basing it on an 11state survey 
our concern is that the numbers are so unreliable that the 
message will be dismissed their statement said 
the dissenters said more nationwide information is needed on 
adoption and foster care and they blamed the states for some of 
the problems in the system four different general accounting 
office reports have shown states have failed to implement 
procedures and protections established by the federal government to 
protect children they said

three christian militiamen were wounded 
in a shootout with gen michel aouns troops on a highway monday 
sending commuters fleeing for cover and underscoring growing 
friction between christian forces 
police said the three wounded men belonged to samir geageas 
6000member lebanese forces which favors an arab leaguebrokered 
peace plan to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
a quarrel developed over traffic rights in the afternoon rush 
hour police said a lebanese forces jeep tried to overtake an army 
patrol at the death river intersection of the main coastal highway 
in east beirut 
militiamen in the jeep opened up with submachine guns at the 
patrol the soldiers retaliated by tossing a hand grenade that blew 
up the jeep said a police spokesman who cannot be identified 
under standing rules 
hundreds of motorists in the bumpertobumper traffic panicked 
many crashed into others cars and then leaped out to duck for 
cover leaving their doors ajar the spokesman said 
it took traffic police half an hour to remove the three victims 
to hospital and restore order on the highway the spokesman added 
the incident appeared spontaneous but the underlying tension 
between the two sides is unmistakable the spokesman said 
the lebanese forces and aouns army have been on a collision 
course since the general rejected the arab peace plan under which a 
new president elias hrawi was elected nov 24 aoun rejected the 
plan for not specifying when syrian troops would leave lebanon 
hrawi has fired aoun from all his posts but the general is 
holding out with 20000 loyal troops in the presidential palace 
located in the christian enclave 
hrawi aoun and geagea are all maronites the christian sect 
that has dominated power in lebanon since it gained independence 
from france in 1943 
aoun has rejected hrawis presidency calling him a syrian 
puppet because he was elected by parliament in an area controlled 
by the syrian army in east lebanon 
the syrians moved in reinforcements two weeks ago and have 
threatened to evict aoun by force from the baabda place five miles 
east of beirut but tens of thousands of supporters have since 
formed a human wall around the hilltop palace in a massive display 
of proaoun sentiment in the 310squaremile christian enclave 
geagea has declared his militia would fight alongside aouns 
army if the enclave was attacked by the syrians who maintain 
40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the 
arab league 
but geagea also made it plain in televised speeches to his 
supporters that he recognizes hrawis legitimacy always referring 
to him as president hrawi

a grand jury that convened monday is 
expected to make a preliminary examination of evidence in the 1963 
slaying of civil rights leader medgar evers 
however hinds county district attorney ed peters has said he 
expects no indictment by this grand jury in the evers slaying 
prosecutors say they are continuing to investigate the killing and 
could present more evidence to a later grand jury 
in fact that is probably what is going to happen said 
assistant district attorney bobby delaughter all we wanted to do 
with this grand jury is advise them what has happened it doesnt 
mean we are quitting we have to start somewhere sometime and 
this is it 
evers field director of the mississippi chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people was shot to 
death june 12 1963 outside his jackson home 
white supremacist byron de la beckwith a former greenwood 
fertilizer salesman was tried twice in hinds county circuit court 
in 1964 two allwhite juries were unable to reach verdicts and the 
charge was dropped 
newspaper reports on oct 1 said he states defunct segregation 
spy agency the sovereignty commission had screened potential 
jurors for beckwiths second trial to aid the defense beckwith now 
lives in a suburb of chattanooga tenn 
the reports raised questions about jury tampering however erle 
johnston of forest who served as executive director of the 
commission during the time of beckwiths trials insisted that 
there was no tampering 
representatives of the district attorneys office have since 
talked to all but one or two of the jurors from the second trial 
delaughter would not say what the jurors said 
delaughter and two investigators have examined records and 
conducted interviews in the evers case 
for right now we have been focused on the second trial 
delaughter said there were no allegations concerning the first 
trial 
the grand jury that convened monday is expected to meet through 
most of the week prosecutors declined to say when the evers matter 
might be discussed the panels proceedings will not be open to the 
public 
evers widow myrlie met privately friday with peters and 
delaughter for an hourlong briefing she said she was not asked to 
testify before the grand jury on her husbands slaying 
i cannot tell you if i am satisfied with the actions of 
that office because i have not seen enough she said 
i would simply hope that as the investigation goes on 
whatever happens that justice be done that there will be 
enough evidence to convict ms evers said

president bush on monday denied allegations 
that us officials had mistreated a salvadoran witness who had 
implicated the salvadoran army in the slayings of six jesuit 
priests last month 
bush also said he had told president alfredo cristiani of el 
salvador that a fair trail must be held for jennifer casolo the 
connecticut church worker arrested after ammunition and explosives 
were found buried in her yard in san salvador 
salvadoran archbishop arturo rivera y damas had said on sunday 
that us officials had resorted to psychological torment and 
brainwashing in an effort to induce the woman luisa cerna to 
retract her story 
a lawyer for an association of american jesuits r scott 
greathead said ms cerna withdrew her statement implicating the 
army under pressure from her american and salvadoran interrogators 
ms cerna a housekeeper for the jesuits first said she saw 
armed men dressed in military uniform enter the rectory of the 
central american university on nov 16 when the jesuits were 
killed she was flown to miami on nov 23 at her request and that 
of the spanish and french ambassadors in el salvador 
during a questionandanswer session with newspaper editors 
bush said he checked into news accounts of the case and was assured 
ms cerna had not been mistreated 
and i dont think that people would tell me something thats 
not true there because there would be a price to pay for that he 
said 
i have confidence that our attorney general would not permit 
the kind of inquisition process that was alluded to in the papers 
today 
some of those accounts said ms cerna had failed lie detector 
tests 
bush added that he expects that details of the case will be 
released so long as they do not jeopardize the legal proceedings 
now under way 
on the casolo case bush said so far i have no received any 
indictation that she will not receive a fair trial 
some presidential spokesmen have suggested that the salvadorqan 
government had a case against the woman in view of the large 
quantity of munitions dug up around her house on nov 26 some 
congressional democrats have criticized those comments 
bush did not mention those exchanges he said he had spoken to 
both cristiani and the us ambassador william walker to 
represent to the salvadorans that its essential that a fair trial 
be granted and be seen to be fair 
ms casolos associates and family insist she has been framed 
she is being held for 90 days during an investigation 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher denied 
the allegations that ms cerna had been forced to recant 
absolutely and unequivocally he said there have been many 
misinformed and unsubstantiated statements that have served to 
suggest that the us government wants to discredit the witnesss 
testimony nothing could be further from the truth he said 
boucher said it appears the archbishop had not been given the 
facts of the case adding that the administration has a deep 
commitment to uncover the truth 
we are doing everything possible to help the salvadorans find 
the killers and bring them to justice he said we expect this 
case to be investigated fully and promptly and that those 
implicated by the investigation will be prosecuted we have made 
this entirely clear to president cristiani and to the armed 
forces 
he said a state department official witnessed all the 
interviews which were carried out by a ustrained salvadoran 
special investigative unit and by agents of the fbi 
at the conclusion of ms cernas questioning she was turned 
over to the jesuits 
during the time she was under us government protection the 
church was given free access to her and never mentioned to us 
officials any allegation of mistreatment he said 
secretary of state james a baker iii sent a letter to 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani expressing concern over 
reports of systematic mistreatment of american religious workers in 
el salvador 
he asked cristiani to give his personal attention to the welfare 
of these workers 
there have been reports that one such worker josephine beecher 
was tortured recently by salvadoran police a group of religious 
leaders said two weeks ago the us government has not been 
aggressive enough in preventing salvadoran officials from engaging 
in the reported abuses

iran has urged its friends in lebanon to 
free the western hostages a senior iranian official said in an 
interview published monday 
we have directed our advice to our friends in lebanon to cease 
their acts with respect to the kidnapping of the western 
hostages the newspaper alraya quoted deputy foreign minister 
ali mohammed besharati as saying 
but the problem is that every time the atmosphere becomes 
propitious for the release of the hostages there are 
counterincidents that cloud the atmosphere said besharati who 
ended a twoday visit to this persian gulf nation on sunday 
the paper said he was referring to the kidnapping by israeli 
commandos of sheik abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem preacher from 
south lebanon on july 28 
on july 31 shiite moslem kidnappers of the organization of the 
oppressed on earth said they killed their american hostage lt col 
william higgins in retaliation for the kidnapping 
most of the 18 hostages held in lebanon are believed to be in 
the hands of iranianbacked shiite groups they are eight 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss an irishman 
and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985 in west beirut 
the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the election of the 
more pragmatic president hashemi rafsanjani gave rise to some hopes 
of iranian pressure on the kidnappers to free their captives 
before coming to qatar besharati visited the united arab 
emirates as part of irans active contacts with the conservative 
gulf cooperation council member states ahead of their annual summit 
dec 18 in oman 
qatar the united arab emirates oman kuwait bahrain and saudi 
arabia make up the council which generally supports the policies 
of iraq irans longtime enemy 
relations between iran and the council states with the 
exception of saudi arabia have been steadily improving since 
persian iran accepted the unsponsored ceasefire to the 
eightyear war with arab iraq

the captain of the uss iowa said monday that 
he doesnt agree or disagree with the navys conclusion that 
gunners mate clayton hartwig likely caused an explosion that left 
47 sailors dead but he did say he thought the ship had been 
sabotaged 
i embraced that it was an intentional act capt fred 
moosally told reporters after his appearance before the senate 
armed services committee 
i cannot make the jump that it was absolutely petty officer 
hartwig i dont think i can say that a definite individual did 
it he was a good gunners mate 
moosally testifying publicly for the first time since the april 
19 blast in the caribbean also softened previous statements made 
under oath to navy investigators that were sharply critical of 
the iowa crews gunfiring capabilities 
with hartwigs mother and sister sitting nearby he told the 
committee i dont agree or disagree with the finding that 
hartwig was responsible for the explosion in the no 2 gun turret 
moosally however said he thought the ship had been sabotaged 
because he didnt believe there could be any other explanation he 
was not testifying under oath monday 
several members of congress have questioned the navys official 
findings 
the navy in a sept 7 report concluded that hartwig most 
likely caused the explosion by inserting some type of detonator 
between bags of gunpowder in one of the ships 16inch guns 
navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantial 
because all the witnesses including hartwig were killed in the 
blast 
the service said the case against hartwig was built largely on 
circumstantial evidence drawn from forensic tests and a 
psychological profile depicting him as a suicidal loner 
three fbi psychologists testified that they believed hartwig 
committed suicide even though the agencys review of laboratory 
tests proved inconclusive 
richard ault of the fbis criminal investigative analysis 
program said there had been nothing in naval investigative service 
files to show that hartwig had been a happy camper however 
ault said the bureau had no conclusive evidence that hartwig blew 
up the turret 
committee chairman sam nunn dga and other members 
interrogated moosally closely on whether he shared the conclusions 
of the naval investigative commission headed by rear adm richard 
milligan 
you agree that it was a wrongful intentional act nunn 
asked 
thats correct the captain replied based on my 
observations on the procedures up there of loading that gun and 
thats the only conclusion i can come to 
but moosally refused to agree with sen alan dixons statement 
that the navy report blaming hartwig was highly speculative 
i wouldnt make that statement he said 
dixon dill shot back that it strains the intelligence of 
most people to conclude that the navy had sufficient evidence to 
hold hartwig accountable for the explosion 
dixon asked moosally if he thought the navy was engaging in a 
coverup 
i hope thats not the case he replied i dont believe it 
is the case 
evelyn hartwig the sailors mother walked up to moosally after 
his testimony and asked him if he thought her son had caused the 
explosion 
i looked him straight in the eye and asked him she told 
reporters later 
moosally told hartwigs mother he was a good gunners mate 
did i say your son did it i didnt say that he kissed mrs 
hartwig 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina also was critical of 
moosallys testimony 
i think somebody has gotten to him she said if he 
doesnt think my brother did it who does he believe did it 
when pressed during the hearing to say why he could not share 
the navys conclusion moosally said it was because he put out to 
sea shortly after the incident and had no access to the evidence 
moosally did acknowledge that his weapons department personnel 
proceeded april 19 with an unauthorized firing in the no 2 gun 
turret involving five powder bags rather than the customary six 
the initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five 
bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the 
breech dless to say i open 
neewas disappointed in my subordinates for 
preempting my command prerogative he said noting that they had 
been punished 
moosally also officially reprimanded after the incident 
steadfastly denied that the iowa had become what dixon called a 
floating laboratory he said the iowa resumed normal firings 
within weeks of the explosion 
i would not have ordered my men in there and i would not have 
gone into the turret if i thought this thing could have happened 
again he said 
moosally told milligans commission he was concerned about the 
capabilities of key iowa crew members he called a gunnery officer 
a basket case and said that a chief petty officer had to be 
kept in a box because of a15793 late friday the pound

the state department expressed concern monday 
about rising tensions in yugoslavia and urged the people to unite 
in support of the reform efforts of prime minister ante markovic 
mutual respect adherence to democratic principles and a 
commitment to avoiding violence are crucial to resolving this 
situation state department spokesman richard boucher said 
tensions among yugoslavias loose federation of six republics 
were exacerbated monday when the leadership of the communist 
countrys secondlargest state croatia called for the 
establishment of a multiparty system 
until now the liberal northern state of slovenia was the only 
one of yugoslavias six constituent republics to openly advocate 
the introduction of westernstyle democracy 
earlier this month serbia in an apparent move to stifle 
burgeoning democratic trends in the country severed all business 
and official ties with slovenia the unprecedented action shook the 
foundations of yugoslavias system 
the united states supports a united federal yugoslavia in 
which human rights and civil rights of all citizens are 
protected boucher said the us strongly supports the ongoing 
efforts of yugoslav prime minister markovic to create a 
marketbased economy and to promote greater political pluralism 
we urge all yugoslavs to put aside their differences and to 
focus their energies on this important reform effort he said

communist party chief petar mladenov 
proposed monday that bulgaria a fortress of stalinism only weeks 
ago hold free elections in may and remove the partys guarantee of 
exclusive power from the constitution 
while the party central committee heard mladenov a sofia court 
registered ecoglasnost an ecological group as bulgarias first 
independent organization 
mladenov said a new constitution should be drafted by the end of 
next year leaving out any guarantee of communist party power 
one cannot postulate the role of party in a democratic society 
or define it on command he told the central committee this 
role can only be won as a result of the peoples trust 
party activities must be in harmony with the constitution and 
its laws mladenov said we have to take practical steps to 
separate the functions of the state and the party 
he recommended passage of a new electoral law and new rules on 
gatherings meetings and demonstrations citizens organizations 
and religion 
early elections are likely to favor the communists the growing 
number of stillunregistered political religious and ecological 
groups were banned until recently and have had little time to 
establish themselves 
in a 90minute speech to the central committee distributed by 
the official news agency bta mladenov said a special party 
congress should be held march 26 state radio reported the next 
regular congress originally was scheduled for early 1991 but then 
moved up to late 1990 
after the may elections he said parliament should pass the 
most important legislation on economic reform including the law 
over property and the law on land and use of land by the end of 
1990 
he said he favored a socialist market economy implying some 
state ownership 
mladenov replaced todor zhivkov party chief for 35 years on 
nov 10 as the central committee met monday evening thousands of 
people with candles kept a silent vigil outside party headquarters 
at least 10000 gathered in the square behind the central 
committee building and organizers said it was to show party 
leaders the people were watching their decisions 
about 5000 people had gathered in the square earlier monday 
dispersing peacefully after an hour two more vigils are planned 
tuesday 
more than 50000 people rallied in downtown sofia on sunday 
demanding the central committee resign and the party give up its 
constitutional monopoly on power as in poland hungary east 
germany and czechoslovakia 
the rallies reflected a growing popular demand for the kind of 
reform taking place elsewhere in eastern europe 
bulgaria was one of moscows staunchest allies but zhivkov did 
little to implement change after mikhail s gorabchev began 
promoting more liberal policies 
since zhivkovs downfall the official media have become more 
open people have been able to demonstrate without police 
interference for the first time in more than 40 years and 
independent groups have been allowed to function 
at mondays evening vigil a woman caught up in an emotional 
debate said bulgarians were willing to stand there around the clock 
until the leadership acted on reform 
she and others said they believed mladenovs promises of change 
but wanted a democracy anchored in law democracy and socialism 
are not compatible she declared 
an old man spoke of change in east germany and czechoslovakia 
then said we are a bit late but we will catch up because we are 
persistent 
state radio quoted mladenov formerly foreign minister as 
telling the central committee he favored broad dialogue with all 
who support a state of law in the framework of socialism 
an overwhelming show of hands at sundays rally approved a 
resolution sponsored by 19 unofficial groups demanding abolition of 
the constitutions first paragraph which enshrines the leading 
party role in bulgaria 
mladenov has described the power monopoly as open to question 
and andrei lukanov his no 2 man said last week the party could 
not claim such an exclusive right 
the party daily rabotnichesko delo already had reported calls 
for an early congress the only party forum that can elect a new 
central committee it said more than 4000 letters and telephone 
calls demanding reforms had been received since zhivkov was 
dismissed 
an opinion poll ordered by the central committee and published 
by the paper said only 23 percent of those responding expressed 
great trust in the party and only 32 percent indicated trust in any 
political organization 
rabotnichesko delo said 1513 people were questioned nov 28 in 
127 work collectives 
it concluded little trust existed because official 
organizations including the party had discredited themselves in 
the eyes of the people and independent groups had not been tested 
the party paper said onethird of those polled said they wanted 
a multiparty political system 689 percent supported a system 
based on law and 777 percent said economic reform was imperative

president bush said monday he has asked 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani to ensure that a connecticut 
woman arrested on suspicion of storing arms for rebel forces 
receive a fair trial 
in his first public remarks about the nov 26 arrest in san 
salvador of jennifer casolo bush said all indications are that 
casolo will be treated fairly 
i think its essential that she receive a fair trial bush 
said at a white house news conference so far i have not received 
any indication that she will not receive a fair trial 
the bush administration came under sharp criticism from 
congressional democrats after presidential spokesmen made comments 
indicating that the salvadoran government had a case against casolo 
bush made no mention of the criticism he said nothing 
indicating that the government is seeking amnesty for casolo or 
considers her innocent 
i have instructed our ambassador william walker and indeed 
talked to cristiani personally to represent to the salvadorans 
that its essential that a fair trial be granted bush said 
i am satisfied so far that that will take place he added 
but it is essential that it not only take place but that it have 
all the appearances of fairness and i think thats what mr 
cristiani is determined to do 
casolo a 28yearold resident of thomaston conn went to el 
salvador in 1985 to work for christian education seminars a group 
dedicated to influencing us policy by organizing tours for 
americans to learn about the 10yearold civil war 
she and two salvadoran friends were arrested nov 26 after a 
police raid on her white stucco house in san salvador from the 
walled garden behind the house police said they uncovered 103 
mortar grenades 213 blocks of dynamite 405 detonators 150 feet 
of slowburning fuse and 21945 rounds of ammunition for 
sovietmade automatic rifles 
casolo was ordered held friday for 90 days while an 
investigation continues into possible links between her the 
explosives and salvadoran rebel forces 
casolos friends and family insist she is innocent the victim 
of a setup the rev jesse jackson attended a service sunday in 
hartford attended by casolos parents and friends during which 
jackson criticized bush saying it was sad that the president 
will not argue jennifers case 
us sen christopher dodd dconn among those to criticize 
bush for his handling of the casolo case arranged for former us 
attorney general ramsey clark to represent casolo in el salvador 
salvadoran law prevents clark from actually defending casolo in

preliminary results of weekend local elections in 
latvia show the grassroots peoples front gaining over half the 
vote in most regions and winning landslides in the countryside an 
activist said monday 
the peoples front which favors independence for the small 
baltic republic is now expected to win about 60 percent overall 
and 80 percent of the rural vote in the final count said member 
christian rozenvalds 
in estonia where elections also were held sunday for seats in 
local councils results were not expected for several days but 
polls have indicated environmentalists were likely to receive half 
the vote there 
the elections were the first in a series of local votes to be 
held in the coming months in all 15 republics as part of the soviet 
transition to multicandidate races and greater democracy 
they are considered critical for mikhail s gorbachevs reforms 
because it is the vast numbers of local and regional bureaucrats 
who are blamed for blocking implementation of his new programs 
in the latvian capital of riga communist party boss arnolds 
klautsens received only 40 percent of the vote for a seat in the 
local council and rozenvalds said he was unlikely to win a runoff 
because a citywide scandal had arisen about ballots faked in his 
favor 
officials have predicted widespread defeats for communist 
leaders in both republics 
there were 33500 candidates running for city council and other 
regional soviets in the two republics

as a highlevel us advance team left to 
prepare for a drug summit in violencetorn colombia president bush 
said monday he wants to go despite some aides misgivings to 
avoid sending a signal that traveling there is unsafe 
right now im very hopeful that the meeting will take place in 
cartagena bush told a group of editorial writers at the white 
house 
the administration advance team that left monday will be 
pressing for a stronger commitment from the cocaineproducing 
countries of peru and bolivia on eradicating their large coca 
crops officials said 
bush acknowledged the security concerns some officials have 
raised about taking his entourage to colombia but added 
i dont want to be the one that sends a signal that nobody 
should go to colombia if they cant be protected 
he said a final decision has not been made on going to 
cartagena a major center of drugtrafficking operations for the 
andes 
i will listen to the experts i will not do anything 
imprudent nobody has ever accused me of doing anything too daring 
but i dont want to undermine this courageous leader he 
said of colombian president virgilio barco he said he did not want 
to send some signal that barco cant provide the security for 
three heads of state visiting his country 
the administration advance team headed by assistant secretary 
of state bernard aronson left for cartagena on monday to work on 
an agenda and lay groundwork for the summit the team will also 
visit peru and bolivia to push for greater evidence of commitment 
on the part of those two countries in the antidrug efforts said 
officials 
the summit will include peruvian president alan garcia and 
bolivian president jaime paz zamora in addition to bush and barco 
the advance group also will try to coordinate with the other 
nations on strategy and will discuss future us assistance among 
the items that will be addressed are cooperation on money 
laundering sharing intelligence extradition and crop substitution 
for the coca fields 
bushs drug policy coordinator william bennett said the 
administration finds colombias antidrug actions and commitment 
exemplary 
but he told reporters last week that the jury is still out 
on peru and bolivia both of which receive drugfighting aid from 
the united states 
he did not elaborate but one administration official speaking 
on the condition of anonymity said they could be more 
aggressive 
drug enforcement administration officials have said that the 
eradication program in peru and bolivia is still developing and is 
improving 
bush has repeatedly praised barcos efforts in the face of 
escalating bombings and violence laid to drug lords against 
civilian and government targets 
colombias problems revolve mostly around drugprocessing 
activities and smuggling with the major cocaine cartels operating 
from there 
but peru and bolivia have the agricultural fields where large 
quantities of coca leaves are cultivated for processing into 
cocaine 
there is definitely a lot of coca out there that has not been 
eradicated an administration official said monday clearly 
people need to get energized and intensify their efforts he also 
requested anonymity 
officials have said that the extent of us assistance to the 
three andean countries is tied to their performance on the drug 
efforts 
the administration wants to see more emphasis by those 
governments on economic alternatives for the farmers whose 
livlihoods would be stripped by eradication of their coca crops 
officials said 
by law the white house must certify each year that countries 
are cooperating in the war on drugs before they can receive foreign 
aid 
negligible progress in reducing coca production has been 
achieved despite spending of more than 100 million on the problem 
over the last 17 years according to a state department report to 
congress in july 
the department says that coca production has increased every 
year 
figures provided by bennetts office say peru produced 249 
metric tons of coca in 1988 and boliva 160 metric tons while 
colombias crop was put at 49 metric tons 
among those accompanying aronson to colombia this week are 
bennetts deputy john walters and michael skol the deputy 
assistant security of state for south american affairs

managers of five of the six plutonium 
processing buildings at the idled rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
likely will be replaced next month as part of a broad plan for 
improving safety officials said monday 
some details of the plan were spelled out for an energy 
department advisory panel by david b van leuven who will be 
associate general manager for defense programs at rocky flats when 
egampg inc takes over as plant operator jan 1 
the current operator rockwell international corp announced in 
september it was quitting rocky flats because of a dispute with the 
energy department over potential criminal liability for past 
environmental violations 
the plant on the outskirts of denver is owned by the energy 
department and is the nations only maker of plutonium triggers for 
nuclear weapons 
a phased halt to rocky flats plutonium operations began in 
midnovember to give egampg time to develop an improvement plan the 
plant has been criticized by government and independent inspectors 
for a wide variety of shortcomings including inadequate safeguards 
against worker exposure to radiation 
van leuven told the advisory committee on nuclear facility 
safety that he would inspect the management of all six plutonium 
buildings in the next few weeks and that he would bring five 
executives from other egampgoperated facilities to be on ready 
standby to replace up to five of the building managers 
van leuven said he already had determined that five of the six 
managers who work for rockwell international are unlikely to meet 
egampgs managerial standards 
one has the capabilities im looking for the rest are 
questionable he said 
van leuven said energy secretary james d watkins ordered egampg 
to develop by the third week in january a timetable for restarting 
rocky flats plutonium operations he declined to speculate on how 
long the plant would be idled but said it would not be restarted 
until all safetyrelated questions had been answered 
well take however long it takes to ensure safe operation 
he told a reporter 
phil warner the designated egampg general manager at rocky flats 
told the panel an integrated plan for running rocky flats 
probably would be ready by the end of march 
van leuven said later that referred to a longrange plan for 
improving the plant and that a phased restart of plutonium 
operations could begin before that plan is ready

michigan colleges and universities should develop 
a zero tolerance policy and require a course in ethnic 
relations to improve campus race relations the michigan civil 
rights commission recommended monday 
the recommendations stemmed from the commissions discussions 
with administrators students and faculty from the university of 
michigan and michigan state ferris state and western michigan 
universities 
it is our hope that universities will look at these 
recommendations as a guide and use them to implement a program of 
this sort on their campus commission chairman benny napoleon 
said at a commission meeting 
racial tensions rose on several campuses this year sitins were 
held at ferris state michigan state and wayne state universities 
students demanded racial sensitivity from staff and other students 
and policies against individuals who commit racist acts 
the zero tolerance policy would define unlawful and 
unacceptable acts of racism and authorize punishments 
the ethnicrelations class would be required for all freshman to 
sensitize individuals to racial issues and concerns at least seven 
us universities already require such a class 
an official at one michigan institution said he didnt believe a 
course would solve the racial problems 
i believe race relations should be spread around in all 
courses not stuffed into one western michigan president diether 
h haenicke said 
napoleon said some michigan schools already are implementing 
programs 
msu is scheduled to begin its ethnicrelations class in 
1992 he said we would hope that they would begin earlier than 
that 
university of michigan president james duderstadt told the 
economic club of grand rapids on monday that all universities have 
a responsibility to strive for ethnic diversification because the 
united states will become increasingly multicultural in the next 
century 
he said he believes his school has made remarkable progress 
in reducing racial tension through minority recruiting 
the recommendations also included setting up procedures to 
process discrimination complaints developing and distributing a 
booklet for students on their civil rights and periodic reviews of 
campus policies and their success 
through a concerted effort we can develop programs that not 
only reduce current tension but also prevent future unlawful acts 
of harassment from occurring state department of civil rights

the nations highest court monday 
dismissed an environmentalists lawsuit that tried to prevent the 
ruling party from building africas tallest building in a city park 
that is popular with the poor 
the high court dismissed a suit filed nov 24 by 
environmentalist wangari maathai that sought to prevent the kenya 
african national union from building a 60story tower in nairobis 
downtown uhuru park 
justice norbury dugdale in his ruling to a packed courtroom 
said only the attorney general can sue on behalf of the public 
mrs maathai who before the ruling accused the court of being 
more concerned with politics than law said she was 
disappointed with the decision but had written to acting attorney 
general timothy mibei asking him to take up the matter 
the most important thing is to rise and express ones opinion 
and say no when you should say no she said if we are not 
listened to then at least we have done what we could do within our 
own constraints 
mibei was unavailable for comment monday 
the controversy involves the ruling partys plans to build a 
media complex in 10acre uhuru park that would include the 60story 
tower two 10story wings malls an auditorium parking for 2000 
people and conference facilities for 5000 people 
scores of people have written letters to kenyas two independent 
newspapers criticizing the plan and pleading with the government to 
move the complex elsewhere 
but president daniel arap moi told critics two weeks ago to 
shut up and succeeded in silencing all but mrs maathai a 
fourstory statue of moi is planned for the front of the tower 
mrs maathai has continued to pursue her efforts to get the 
building relocated to one of the vast open areas around nairobi 
despite parliaments threats to ban her environmental organization 
the green belt movement 
she says the 197 million project is not in the public interest 
lawmakers said her court effort to bar the complex was 
tantamount to suing the head of state and accused her 12yearold 
environmental group of being subversive

the senate foreign relations and armed 
services committees will hold a series of hearings early next year 
to explore the changes occurring in eastern europe and the soviet 
union and their implications for the united states 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said monday 
that a central question is the extent to which the military threat 
posed by the soviet union and the warsaw pact has been reduced and 
how us military strategy and defense spending should be adjusted 
mitchell said administration officials including secretary of 
state james a baker iii and outside experts will be called as 
witnesses 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman 
said his panel also would focus on the implications for 
conventional and strategic arms control and the military role of 
us allies 
mitchell said that while there is much speculation that a 
reduced military threat from the soviet union will lead to reduced 
defense spending it is not clear whether that will result in a 
peace dividend that can be used to meet other domestic spending 
priorities

an atheist forced village officials to 
remove lighted crosses from two water towers but residents are 
fighting back with scores of homemade crosses in businesses front 
yards and windows 
christmas spirit and town unity have never been stronger 
residents of this community 30 miles northeast of chicago said 
monday 
we felt very badly that this man could come in here that 
doesnt even live here and say that we had to stop a tradition 
weve been doing for years said katie wolter this is peoples 
way of speaking out 
robert sherman a midwest official of american atheists inc 
contends the two disputed crosses which sat atop the village 
water towers for almost 40 years and traditionally were lighted for 
the christmas season represented an unconstitutional mingling of 
church and state 
he threatened to sue the village if the crosses removed last 
winter for repairs were used this christmas season the village 
board decided nov 21 to replace them with lighted stars rather 
than risk a costly legal battle 
sherman said the boards decision was a smashing victory for 
american atheists which has challenged the use of crosses and 
nativity scenes on public property across the country 
this is the first time in the history of this country that 
illuminated christian crosses have been forced down from government 
property without necessitating a lawsuit said sherman of the 
chicago suburb of buffalo grove 
but if there are no crosses on the water towers theyve sprung 
up nearly everywhere else as the community of about 6000 counters 
the move 
one of the first appeared on top of mers restaurant a block 
from the towers 
when you see the crosses up its christmas time said 
restaurant coowner bobby mers a lifelong village resident im 
still kind of upset that its not on the tower i grew up with it 
handmade crosses have appeared at ms wolters jewelry store 
and other businesses and homes at the urging of mayor james keagle 
and others 
the rev byron maher has counted 95 crosses in just a fifth of 
my parish since he exhorted his congregation at the 
transfiguration roman catholic church to show their faith 
some are on the homes some are in the yards some are in the 
windows some people have used their tv antennas to make crosses 
theyve put lights on them maher said 
kevin kennebeck vice president of performance paving scaled a 
110foot telephone pole at his business to attach a 12foot lighted 
cross near the top that he hopes will mark a new tradition 
the effect is not just visual maher said 
many people have come and told me that theres never been such 
unity and christmas spirit as theres been now he said 
sherman said he thinks the response is more a show of resentment 
toward atheists than a display of christian faith or christmas 
spirit 
maher disputes that 
its not attacking him at all it is showing our 
christianity the priest said 
in fact weve got countless people here praying for him

character from a storybook or literature among them a 
tafettabedecked scarlett ohara with widebrimmed southern ladys 
hat an axwieling paul bunyon astride his blue ox babe a 
satinclad aladdin with his genie bottle in hand and a

this is sort of a celebration of libraries and books said 
mrs bush who for many years has devoted herself to the cause of 
literacy 
the tree also has the traditional 100 fourinch velvet balls 
two representing each state in the nation 
mrs bush fresh from her daily 1mile swim gave reporters a 
tour of the lavish white house decorations which include 14 large 
snowflocked blue spruce trees in the entrance and cross halls at 
the main entrance 
planning for the decorations began last february when the first 
lady discussed her wishes with the white house chief floral 
designer nancy clarke 
in the east room stand two 14foot blue spruce trees ornately 
garlanded with copperred metallic ribbons and bursting with 
lifesize grapes pears apples oranges tangerines and 
pomegranates

baroque 48figure creche that has been in the white house every 
christmas since 1967 when it was donated by a new jersey woman 
numerous poinsettias deck the halls and in the state dining 
room a giant gingerbread house is tempting the bush grandchildren 
mrs bush said it was created by white house executive chef hans 
raffert who has baked a gingerbread house for the presidents 
annually for the last 20 years 
the table in the state dining room features two boxwood 
topiaries decoated with densely packed candy canes peppermint 
balls and cookies 
mrs bush said there was a time when she did all the 
christmascookie baking for the family but now their cook makes and 
decorates them 
the bushes will have their five children spouses and 11 
grandchildren on hand for the holiday the entire clan will travel 
to the presidential retreat at camp david md next week to spend 
christmas there 
the family opens presents on christmas day in what the first 
lady predicted will be chaos 
she and the president will not exchange gifts mrs bush said 
we do not give presents the president and i she said 
adding that it is an arrangement they have followed for many years 
because we felt we just had so much 
the bushes were on hand this past weekend as 40 volunteers put 
up the christmas decorations they had intended to spend the 
weekend at camp david but were prevented by snowy weather mrs 
bush said they enjoyed being there for the decorating 
we bounced up and down the stairs george and i talking to 
these people 
they came in saturday night to find the decorators engaged in a 
snow fight with the fake snow she added 
the bushes have their own personal christmas tree in their 
private upstairs quarters and it is decorated with cookies she

the navy plans to drop a smallscale model of 
a satellite launch vehicle into californias monterey bay on 
thursday in a hushhush program to develop a reusable lowcost 
rocket a space industry newspaper said monday 
the test will involve releasing the model booster from a 
helicopter to demonstrate that the booster can survive a water 
landing at 200 mph said space news citing unnamed sources 
the navy was asked for comment but did not immediately respond 
the only reusable space vehicles the united states has are the 
shuttle and its rocket boosters the shuttle lands on a runway the 
boosters drop into the ocean are towed back to port to be 
refurbished for reuse 
the project is being conducted on a shoestring budget with 
navy funds authorized by navy admiral carlisle trost chief of 
naval operations according to the navy source space news said 
in its dec 11 preview issue 
the rocket would take off from the ocean surface which would 
provide tremendous flexibility in launching secret missions the 
spent stages would be slowed in their fall and buoyed at the 
surface by balloons

the leader of a violent crack ring was found 
guilty monday of ordering the murder of a rookie police officer who 
was guarding the firebombed home of a witness in a drug case 
howard pappy mason 31 faces mandatory life in prison 
without parole for a slaying that had come to symbolize the battle 
against illegal drugs 
jurors in us district court in brooklyn deliberated 13 hours 
over three days before finding mason guilty on all 11 
drugconspiracy charges including one specifying that he ordered 
the february 1988 murder of officer edward byrne 22 
byrnes parents matthew and ann byrne who had attended the 
trial daily embraced and thanked assistant us attorney leslie r 
caldwell before quickly leaving court by a rear door 
the elder byrne a lawyer and former police lieutenant gave his 
slain sons badge to george bush who used it as a potent symbol 
during his presidential campaign bush now keeps the shield in his 
oval office desk 
mason boycotted most of his trial and remained in a courthouse 
holding cell presumably watching on closedcircuit television 
four other people were convicted in state court earlier this 
year of carrying out the murder and have been sentenced to the 
maximum of 25 years to life in prison 
this accounts for all the people who had a hand in the brutal 
murder us attorney andrew j maloney said of masons 
conviction 
state authorities let mason be tried in federal court because 
new york state rules of evidence restricting testimony by 
codefendants made conviction in state court less likely 
during the trial of the four convicted murderers there was 
frequent testimony that the order to assassinate byrne had come 
from masons cell at the brooklyn house of detention he had been 
convicted on a weapons charge and jailed two days before the 
slaying 
the prosecutions key witness viola nichols testified mason 
had directed the officers murder because another patrolman 
disrespected him in front of his colleagues by upbraiding him 
for drinking beer in public 
defense lawyer harry c batchelder jr filed a motion to set the 
verdict aside asserting mason was not mentally competent to 
participate in his trial which lasted about two weeks

president bush on friday cited enormous 
frustrations in dealing with the democraticled congress but said 
he will hunt again next year for bipartisan support for his 
sometimesbattered agenda 
im disappointed in some ways with the congress and with our 
progress bush told a group of editorialpage editors he cited 
crime cleanair legislation and childcare programs as examples 
democratic leaders in turn have said that those are all 
important issues but that bushs proposals would do too little to 
solve problems or would take unwise approaches 
bush also suggested that the 50 billion approved by congress to 
rescue the ailing savings and loan industry might not be enough 
in a halfhour questionandanswer session bush cited 
negative highly partisan comments from the democrats in 
congress 
still bush who began his term pronouncing an era of the 
offered hand said im determined when the congress comes 
back to hold out the hand and try again 
on another partisan issue the president dismissed as 
balderdash suggestions that republicans are losing support 
among voters because of the abortion issue 
the american people have not changed their fundamental views 
that had them support me over my opponent bush said the 
democrats hold a seat hold a gubernatorial seat and they dance 
around the grave of what they hope is the republican party he 
added 
he was referring to the virginia governors race in which 
democrat douglas wilder won last month after a campaign emphasizing 
his views in favor of abortion rights 
overall the president said he was generally satisfied with a 
productive year he boasted that not one of his 10 vetoes had 
been overridden 
on other topics in the wideranging session the president 
denied his decision to send national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and a top state department aide on a surprise visit to 
beijing marked a move toward full normalization of relations 
he said the weekend mission four months after last junes bloody 
government crackdown was an attempt not to further isolate the 
chinese people 
insisted he would do nothing to force the issue of german 
reunification its too sensitive and its not the role for the 
united states to do that bush said suggesting the day when 
either the us president or the soviet leader had a role on the 
issue of european boundaries had long passed 
reiterated his desire that a drug summit can be held next 
february in colombia despite recent violence there saying he 
wanted no part of sending a signal that colombian president 
virgilio barco cannot provide the proper security 
said that he would give more attention next year to trade 
issues saying that while he had no intention of bashing 
trading partners needlessly i am not relaxed about where we 
stand in terms of dismantling foreign barriers against us goods 
said that the united states does not favor any step that would 
force israel to be pressured into negotiating with the 
palestine liberation organization despite secretary of state james 
a baker iiis efforts to help formulate a way to get middle east 
peace talks going 
said he was satisfied so far that jennifer casolo would 
receive a fair trial in el salvador casolo 28 of thomaston 
conn was arrested nov 26 in a police raid at her house in san 
salvador police say they found weapons including grenades and 
dynamite hidden behind her house 
on friday casolo was ordered held for 90 days while 
investigation continues bush said he had personally told 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani that its essential that a 
fair trial be granted 
bush also denied allegations that us officials had mistreated 
a salvadoran witness who had implicated the salvadoran army in the 
slayings of six jesuit priests last month 
on his relations with congress bush said there have been 
some good moments and thereve been some enormous frustrations 
i am not overly satisfied but i think the first year has gone 
pretty well he said 
he said he was particularly pleased that the united states was 
ending the year with a stillgrowing economy 
and while difficult budget choices loom bush said he was 
pleased he had been able to keep my pledge of no new taxes for 
this year 
at the same time bush said that efforts to clean up the 
financially troubled savings and loan industry were proceeding 
haltingly despite the 50 billion congress authorized for congress 
to close down defunct sampls bush said im now told this might not 
be enough 
all i do know is that weve got to clean it up and its a 
whale of a mess bush said

a woman who was the anonymous plaintiff in one of 
two landmark us supreme court decisions legalizing abortion said 
she hopes never to be separated from her 22yearold daughter now 
that the two are reunited 
i told her shes just going to have to plan on being with me 
the rest of her life said sandra cano who had a tearful reunion 
with her daughter april takier of tacoma wash at the atlanta 
airport saturday 
the two were separated 20 years ago before mrs cano then 
sandra bensing became plaintiff jane doe in doe vs bolton 
the lawsuit that successfully challenged georgias abortion law 
the supreme court used her case to strike down the law on jan 
22 1973 the same day the court struck down texas abortion law in 
the more famous case labeled roe vs wade 
mrs cano later decided not to go through with the abortion and 
gave birth to melissa she gave her up for adoption in 1970 
mrs cano was reunited with melissa 19 earlier this year and 
found her son joel now 23 in 1977 
the reunion with april leaves only one of her four children 
still missing a daughter whom she named lisa before she gave her 
up for adoption in 1969 
as long as shes missing theres still part of me missing 
mrs cano said of lisa but i have nowhere else to look 
mrs cano said her two older children joel and april had been 
taken from her in 1969 she said she lost custody of the children 
after a dispute with a sitter and because of me being young and 
naive 
mrs cano who lives in suburban atlanta but has declined to 
give her hometown said she tried to regain custody of the children 
and finally got joel when he was 11 
she was unsuccessful in her attempts to find april until the 
week after thanksgiving ms takier called saying she had been 
trying to find her mother since being abandoned by her adoptive 
family as a teenager 
she said she remembered that her name originally was bensing and 
that she was adopted in georgia so my roommate and i sat down 
and all we did was start calling all the cities all over georgia 
looking for a bensing 
we couldnt find that so we looked for alva and eva smith my 
first foster family i got their number and called her and she had 
my grandmas phone number and my grandma had my moms phone 
number 
she said she didnt recognize her mother at their reunion 
saturday but my brother looks exactly like i remember him 
ms takier said she plans to stay in georgia indefinitely and 
will seek work as a lab technician 
i cried when she saw her mother she said i didnt know 
what to say im so happy so excited 
mrs cano has changed her position on abortion and has become a 
spokeswoman for antiabortion groups in the years since doe vs 
bolton 
she said last week that she plans to increase her involvement in 
the antiabortion movement now that she has most of her family back

congressional democrats denouncing renewed 
highlevel bush administration contacts with china as 
embarrassing kowtowing vowed monday to revive legislation 
protecting chinese students here and imposing sanctions against 
their government 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine told reporters 
that bushs decision to dispatch two leading foreign policy 
advisers to beijing over the weekend undermines his 
administrations professed support for human rights and sends the 
worst possible message at the worst possible time 
mitchell said bushs move makes a mockery of our profession of 
concern for human rights and was inconsistent with our stated 
ideals 
the majority leader noted that bush had declared in june that 
the united states could not conduct normal relations with a 
government that had reacted to weeks of prodemocracy 
demonstrations with a bloody crackdown 
yet that is exactly what appears to be happening mitchell 
said referring to the mission to beijing led by national security 
adviser brent scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger 
mitchell said bushs decision raises the question of how the 
administration might react if the soviet union intervened 
militarily to crackdown on democratic movements in eastern europe 
and within its own borders 
will the president send his emissaries to moscow to tell tham 
that we want to do business as usual mitchell asked 
hypothetically or are there two standards one for the chinese 
and another for the russians and everyone else 
the majority leader also said he will lead efforts to override 
bushs nov 30 veto of legislation to permit any chinese student 
fearful of reprisal if forced to return home to remain in the 
united states beyond his visas expiration 
bush said then that he was directing attorney general dick 
thornburgh to take the steps necessary to extend administratively 
to all chinese students in the united states the same benefits 
that were in the bill he was vetoing 
separately the house and senate voted just before adjourning 
for the year nov 21 to impose political and economic sanctions on 
the chinese government but the approvals were to slightly 
different versions of the legislation and the differences were not 
resolved before adjournment 
both versions would have imposed as a matter of law sanctions 
bush put in place days after the june 3 crackdown both measures 
would permit the sanctions to be lifted if the human rights 
situation in china improved 
the white house opposes that legislation saying bush needs 
flexibility in lifting the sanctions which include a suspension of 
financing for us investment in china and a ban on exports to 
china of military nuclear and satellite technology 
rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs asian subcommittee said he believes bushs veto of the 
visaextension bill will be overridden and that congress will act 
quickly to revive the sanctions legislation when it returns next 
month 
i believe the congress is not in the mood to kowtow to these 
chinese leaders solarz said 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee called bushs move ill timed to say the least 
at a time of major breakthroughs for democracy in eastern 
europe bushs action sends the message that we care less about 
human rights in china nunn said 
asked about bushs announcment that china now has promised not 
to sell missiles in the middle east nunn noted that an identical 
promise was made several years ago to thensecretary of defense 
frank carlucci 
if the chinese have now promised that a second time the 
obvious question is what happened the first time nunn said 
bush himself received a similar assurance when he visited china 
in february

three organizations intent on helping poland 
enhance its 1990 harvest monday urged us agriculture businesses 
to donate desperately needed machinery chemicals feed and animal 
pharmaceuticals 
the donations are necessary because of a gap in the us 
legislative package that provided 533 million in assistance to 
poland and hungary said josiah lee auspitz secretary of the sabre 
foundation a nonprofit educational and scientific organization 
that promotes free enterprise 
the government is sending commodities and expertise to poland 
but there was no provision in the law for the inputs such as 
machinery fertilizer and feed needed to make a modern farm 
system work auspitz said 
polish banks he said dont have the money to loan against next 
years harvest to enable the farmers to buy those input items 
fertilizers animalcare products animal feed pesticides 
fungicides and herbicides top the list of items polish farmers 
need also needed is machinery such as planters grain drills 
potato seeders fertilizer spreaders manure spreaders plows 
sprayers chain saws and harvesters 
it is feasible financially for companies to donate these 
items without losing a lot of money auspitz said at a daylong 
seminar sponsored by his foundation the us chamber of commerce 
and the foundation for the development of polish agriculture a 
private polish group dedicated to strengthening that nations 
private sector farms 
the us tax code allows for a deduction of twice the cost for 
donations of inventory property for the care of the ill the needy 
or minor children private polish farmers qualify as needy said 
tax lawyer stuart a smith who appeared on a panel with auspitz 
he said companies should make donations to a taxexempt 
organization such as sabre which will certify the products are 
going as gifts for the needy the donated materials may not be 
given to polish governmentowned farms or the government itself to 
qualify for the us tax deduction 
about 77 percent of the farms in poland are private but under 
communism the state cooperatives were the only ones benefitting 
from technological advances david hopper senior vice president of 
the world bank said during a separate panel discussion 
the private sector has been starved from modern inputs he 
said 
polish farmers need the machinery and chemicals by april 1 the 
beginning of the growing season to show progress in the 1990 
harvest 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher encouraged participation 
saying in a letter that sabres plan follows the intent of the 
agreement on privatesector cooperation between poland and the 
united states

the national opposition union on 
monday accused the governing sandinistas of waging a campaign of 
provocation and violence to intimidate opponents in the feb 25 
elections 
virgilio godoy the opposition unions vice presidential 
candidate and other party leaders told a news conference that 
sandinistas provoked rioting sunday in masatepe in which one man 
was killed and more than 20 people were injured

the violence to a summit of five central american presidents

godoy acknowledged that uno supporters also took part in the 
fighting but insisted the sandinistas started it 
violence generates violence this is inevitable he said 
nobody here is going to wait to have their throat slit but the 
provocations continue and the one responsible for this is the 
sandinista front he said he added that uno will not pull out of 
the campaign 
other party officials told the news conference that after the 
rioting in masatepe 30 miles south of managua groups of masked 
men attacked uno supporters in many nearby villages they said they 
were asking for protection from united nations and organization of

rally at the town park and combatants fought with machetes rocks 
and sticks the sandanistas masatepe campaign headquarters was

and promised they would be free and fair in exchange the central 
american leaders declared they would try to demobilize the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras most of whom are based in 
honduran border camps by dec 5

police officials met with black 
leaders monday to discuss the apparent accidental shooting of an 
unarmed black man by a white policeman during a drug search 
we want to get as much information out as possible said 
police chief joe gerwens 
patrick lavon lee 28 was shot in the back of the head in a 
predominantly black neighborhood sunday by officer robert thomas 
mccabe 28 
lee was in critical condition monday at broward general medical 
center and was not expected to recover doctors said 
gerwens said the timing was unfortunate because of events in 
miami 
the shooting was the second involving a police officer and an 
unarmed suspect in south florida since a miami jury on thursday 
convicted officer william lozano of manslaughter in the deaths of 
two black men killed last january 
the slayings triggered three days of rioting and miami had 
braced for more unrest in the event lozano was acquitted 
later thursday a hallandale police officer shot and killed an 
unarmed robbery suspect following a car chase both the suspect and 
the officer were black 
on sunday mccabes 45caliber automatic apprently went off 
accidentally as lee was pinned against a car police said 
officials said they were unsure why the officer drew his gun 
because the suspect wasnt armed 
gerwens contacted black leaders sunday held a news conference 
and met with them again monday to release more information black 
leaders told reporters they were satisfied with the way things were 
being handled 
the only thing we can do now is wait for the investigation 
said carlton moore former president of the fort lauderdale chapter 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
we need to know exactly what happened and how the firearm 
discharged 
the broward county state attorneys office is investigating the 
incident prosecutors said a grand jury would decide whether to 
charge mccabe the police department is also investigating 
mccabe and his partner were looking for drug dealers in one of 
the citys most violent neighborhoods in northern fort lauderdale 
when they encountered lee and another man 
witnesses said mccabe cursed lee then grabbed him and threw him 
against a car mccabe then put his gun at the back of lees head 
pats hands were up and he started to turn around and then the 
gun went off said carolyn howard who was standing less than 10 
feet away 
then the cop said oh my god my gun went off howard said 
no statement has been taken from mccabe who has been with the 
department since august 
mccabe is on administrative leave with pay to collect 
himself said police spokesman ott cefkin 
lee has been arrested several times and been convicted of armed 
robbery and cocaine possession with intent to deliver police said 
he did not have any cocaine on him at the time of the shooting

the four allies of world war ii held their 
first meeting in 18 years monday and stressed the need for 
stability at a time of convulsive change in east germany where the 
communist party has lost its grip 
the soviet union which requested the meeting urged respect for 
existing boundaries and politics the official east german news 
agency adn reported 
moscow has expressed concern at the speed with which the two 
germanys appear to be moving toward reunification as have the 
british 
adn said the soviet news agency tass quoted ambassador 
vyacheslav kochemasov as saying the soviet union during the 
four power talks on monday in west berlin strongly emphasized that 
respect for the territorial and political reality of europe is 
necessary 
at a central committee meeting saturday in moscow president 
mikhail s gorbachev cautioned outsiders against interfering in 
east germany 
a joint statement issued by the ambassadors monday said there 
was a common understanding of the importance of stability and 
confidence was expressed that the united states united kingdom 
france and soviet union could contribute to that on the basis of 
the quadripartite agreement of 1971 
it was the first meeting since the 1971 session that produced 
agreement on improving the links between west germany and berlin 
which was isolated within east germany 
after world war ii the four victorious allies divided berlin 
into four sectors they still have the final say in its affairs 
a soviet diplomat in east berlin said privately after mondays 
2hour conference in principle for all the four powers it was 
a very important meeting we the soviets underlined the need for 
stability

closer together 
his proposal also called for improved air service to berlin 
making the city the site of youth exchanges and international 
conferences and holding a future olympics there 
further meetings of the four powers may be held the statement 
said a french diplomat would not give a timetable but said the 
level of future sessions would depend on the issues to be addressed 
east germany opened the berlin wall and its other borders a 
month ago to halt a flood of emigration and huge prodemocracy 
protests at home since then public demand for reform has become 
so great the entire communist party leadership resigned 
such west german politicians as chancellor helmut kohl and willy 
brandt former chancellor and west berlin mayor have made a point 
of visiting the city 
kohl says germany will be reunited one day but not now 
he was attending a meeting of his christian democratic party in 
west berlin on monday and told reporters we do not know when 
the day will come when this vision will become reality but i am 
convinced that it will come 
of the concern in some countries about reunification he said 
the goal of our policies is not to create an overpowering germany 
in the middle of europe he said solution of the german question 
within a european framework would respect the security needs of 
all others involved 
secretary of state james a baker iii is to meet with kohl on 
tuesday the talks had been planned for bonn the west german 
capital but us officials said they would be held in west berlin 
on sunday before leaving washington for europe baker said 
that if reunification happens too abruptly you run a greater 
risk that it might not happen peacefully 
president bush said monday it was too sensitive an issue among 
the european allies for the process to be speeded up and added 
this is a matter for the german people to decide it isnt a 
matter thats going to be determined by the united states 
dorothee wilms west germanys minister in charge of relations 
with east germany said germans have the right of 
selfdetermination just like any other people 
in an interview with saarland state radio she said german unity

president bush on monday defended his decision 
to renew contacts with china saying relations with beijing are 
still strained by the tiananmen square crackdown but i dont want 
to make it any worse 
he pledged to keep looking for ways to find common ground 
despite the chinese armys killing of hundreds of prodemocracy 
demonstrators last june 
i dont want to see that china remains totally isolated the 
president said however he said his initiative toward china was 
not a signal of total normalization of relations 
acknowledging that china remains unapologetic for the crackdown 
bush said we have contacts with countries that have egregious 
records on human rights 
even as bush spoke congressional democrats stepped up their 
criticism of his actions senate majority leader george mitchell 
condemned the us overture as embarrassing kowtowing to the 
chinese government 
bush made his comments in a question and answer session with 
editorial page editors from around the country after the return to 
washington of brent scowcroft the white house national security 
adviser and lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary of state from 
their surprise trip to beijing 
the president hailed an announcement from beijing that it would 
not sell missiles in the middle east bush called that a very 
sound development though he had received the same assurances 
during a trip to china last february 
explaining his decision to send scowcroft and eagleburger to 
beijing bush said i do not want to isolate the chinese people 
i do not want to hurt the chinese people 
bush said generally speaking i realize the difficulty of 
this relationship i dont want to make it any worse like to 
think it would improve 
even so he said that us sanctions imposed against china on 
june 5 remain in place and that the administration was still 
unhappy with beijings human rights record 
a white house statement acknowledged that bush had decided in 
september to allow chinese engineers to resume work with a us 
team installing hightech equipment on f8 jet fighters to be sold 
to beijing this was the only way to avoid turning a suspension 
of military sales into a termination the statement said 
adding that no deliveries have taken place 
bush talked in guarded terms refusing to say precisely what 
steps china would have to take to normalize relations with 
washington 
referring to the crackdown bush said i think the chinese 
know they still have to address themselves to the problems that 
were inherent in this episode 
bush responded with an emphatic no when asked if he worried 
that the scowcrofteagleburger trip would signal the soviets that 
he would tolerate a crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in the 
soviet union and eastern europe 
i have no concern about that at all as long as we are properly 
positioned in favor of human rights and as long as the soviet 
union knew that we are not sending a signal of quote total 
normalization unquote i will be careful that we do not send that 
signal he said 
bushs remarks were part of a wider attempt by the white house 
to explain the gesture toward beijing to and to soften criticism 
the administration said that china a world power with a nuclear 
arsenal was too important a country to remain in isolation 
despite us outrage at its killing of demonstrators last june 
echoing bushs theme white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater said this trip was not intended to develop normal 
relations with china in any immediate sense 
democrats meanwhile continued to criticize bushs decision 
at a time when americas bipartisan commitment to freedom is 
bearing fruit in eastern europe the last thing he should be doing 
is wavering in our commitment to freedom in china said house 
majority leader richard a gephardt dmo 
standing up for our principles is always the best policy 
gephardt said if america doesnt stand up for those who seek 
freedom who will 
mitchell dmaine said the administration supports human 
rights in its words it does not do so in its deeds these 
actions make a mockery of our profession of concern for human 
rights and our inconsistent with our stated ideals 
at the white house fitzwater said bushs decision to send 
emissaries to beijing had nothing to do with concessions made or 
internal changes in china 
bushs spokesman it was the democratic changes sweeping eastern 
europe that prompted bush to send scowcroft and eagleburger on 
their mission 
he said bush felt these are changes in the world that have to 
be considered by all the leaders certainly of the west as well as 
the east that its important to know how china responds how they 
think about this how they see their changing relationship to the 
soviet union and eastern bloc 
fitzwater indicated the united states was unhappy the 
scowcrofteagleburger visit had been portrayed in the chinese press 
as evidence of uschinese reconciliation i probably would have 
dictated a little different coverage he said

former us secretary of state george 
shultz said monday he is still bullish about the philippines 
despite the latest coup attempt and thinks president corazon 
aquinos government will survive 
shultz said he is visiting manila as a private citizen and that 
his trip was planned by his company five months ago he now is a 
director of the chicagobased bechtel construction and engineering 
conglomerate 
a sevenday military rebellion ended on saturday when the last 
rebel holdouts surrendered at mactan air base 350 miles south of 
manila the uprising killed at least 113 people and injured more 
than 580 
i have a feeling that this effort by a renegade group in the 
military to overturn a democratic government has had a kind of 
reverse effect shultz said 
he said the coup attempt galvanized the people leading people 
to say that we struggled hard to get a free and democratic system 
and it is precious and so we have to fight for it and support 
it 
he said this will mean a strong following for the present 
leadership and so i continue to be bullish on the philippines 
shultz said he and his wife have become close to mrs aquino and 
were invited by her to dinner sunday 
she was in a very upbeat and feisty mood and i think it was 
great he reported 
he said us air cover that was provided for loyal forces early 
in the insurrection was helpful in fighting the rebellion 
it would have been shameful for the us government to 
refuse support to a friend a democracy under siege 
i believe that president bush handled it extremely well its 
the sort of thing that friends expect to see shultz added 
he also said the prodemocracy movement sweeping east europe is 
a phenomenon that is being replayed and the philippines started 
it 
he was referring to the people power revolt that drove the 
late president ferdinand marcos into hawaiian exile and installed 
mrs aquino as president in february 1986 
shultz on monday called on foreign secretary raul manglapus who 
said shultz carried no message from bush

a joyous cacophony of bells and 
whistles heralded a popular victory over the communists and 
czechoslovaks settled down monday to choosing a president from 
among heroes the old order called villains 
a presidential contest appeared to be developing and the people 
may get to decide 
this is the end of communism exulted jana navara an 
actress in pink mukluks adding the sound of a brass chime to the 
bells of pragues tyn church on old town square her 3yearold 
daughter made a triumphant v with two tiny fingers 
the brief blast of noise replaced a threatened general strike 
canceled after events brought to power the first government in 41 
years not dominated by communists and drove president gustav husak 
from office 
soldiers began removing barbed wire from the border with neutral 
austria and prague radio reported plans to disband pacem im terris 
a statecontrolled organization of roman catholic clergy priests 
outside the group often were persecuted as the state tried to 
impose its will 
in the first official act against members of the old leadership 
the prosecutor charged former party ideologue vasil bilak for his 
part in crushing the 1968 prague spring of reform the official 
news agency ctk reported 
according to some opinions his deeds can be considered 
treason it said but added that bilak now 72 could not be 
tried because the statute of limitations had run out 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
petar mladenov head of the bulgarian communist party said 
free elections should be held in may and a new constitution written 
that does not guarantee the party a monopoly on power 
the four allies of world war ii held their first meeting in 18 
years monday and stressed the need for stability at a time of rapid 
change in east germany it was requested by the soviet union which 
is concerned about german reunification 
more than 150000 people held a prodemocracy rally in 
leipzig a southern industrial city in east germany and many 
called for german unity 
in prague parliament meets tuesday and has two weeks to elect a 
president but the club of communist deputies similar to a 
majority party caucus said monday it would support a referendum 
a statement from the club said it would recommend to the 
federal assembly to adopt the necessary measures for an 
allpeoples vote because the authority of the head of state is 
so important that only the people can decide ctk reported 
earlier politburo member ondrej saling said the communists and 
opposition had agreed the president should be a czech with no party 
affiliation 
in my view the president must be someone who enjoys broad 
support and guarantees stability he said 
that seemed to suggest vaclav havel the playwright who was 
jailed for opposing communism and is now the driving force behind 
civic forum the main opposition 
posters reading havel na hrad havel to the castle the 
presidential residence sprouted all over prague 
the candicacy of alexander dubcek who led the 1968 reform as 
party chief until soviet tanks arrived threw the result into 
doubt however and other names were being mentioned 
in a lateevening television interview with soviet television 
shown in prague havel said he would keep his country in the warsaw 
pact 
while evoking an ideal of europe as a peaceful community 
with no military blocs he said we shall not get any closer to 
this ideal by any kind of individual split from the warsaw treaty 
havels gravelly voice rolled over a crowd of 100000 people 
sunday in wenceslas square as he listed popular victories over the 
past three weeks which the people had come to celebrate they 
chanted we want havel and he made a very presidential bow 
dubcek 68 remains a popular symbol but evokes little emotion 
among younger czechoslovaks who regard him as a product of the 
system they intend to abolish 
he also is a slovak as is marian calfa the new premier calfa 
has said a political tradition under which one office is held by a 
slovak and the other by a czech would be respected 
czechoslovakia joins poland in forming an administration not 
dominated by communists but unlike poland its government is led 
by a member of the party 
we have not won yet havel told the sunday rally which was 
televised live but he added the yearslong deadly silence of 
a humiliated people has been drowned out by a multivoiced popular 
choir 
a rally in support of havel was held monday at plzen west of 
prague and many czechoslovaks ringing bells around the country 
also wore the ubiquitous blue red and white havel for 
president buttons 
the burst of bellringing occurred three weeks to the day after 
students rose up angered by brutal police assaults on peaceful 
demonstrators they surged through the streets of prague stopping 
street cars to sound their bells then everyone joined in 
soon afterward a liberty bell appeared on a hill above prague 
where a statue of stalin once had been in letters visible across 
the vltava river it was labeled the final bell the last line 
of every czechoslovak fairy tale

foreign minister moshe arens said monday israel 
wants guarantees from the united states that the plo will have no 
role in the peace process before he attends talks in washington 
no date has been set for the meeting between arens secretary of 
state james a baker iii and egyptian foreign minister esmet 
abdelmeguid the three will discuss the composition of a 
palestinian delegation to direct talks with israeli officials 
in violence monday in the occupied territories troops shot and 
wounded 14 palestinian protesters arab hospital officials said 
the army said it was investigating 
arens cast some doubt monday on his planned trip to washington 
saying he is concerned about reports that egypt is acting as a 
postman for the plo 
the egyptians who started the process as an independent 
factor have lately presented themselves as in effect a postman 
for the plo arens said on army radio if this is what will be 
i fear that we wont get very far 
last month the cabinet linked israeli acceptance of bakers 
proposal for the washington meeting to assurances that the plo 
would play no part in the peace process 
asked about the proposed washington trip arens said firstly 
im not going yet we will first conduct contacts concerning the 
guarantees that our cabinet has requested 
cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein is scheduled to go to 
washington this week to discuss the assurances sought by israel 
said avi pazner a spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
the latest hitch in the talks followed weekend news reports that 
israeli egyptian us and palestinian officials were holding 
secret contacts to draw up a preliminary list of palestinian 
negotiators 
the clashes monday were sparked by the fatal shootings sunday of 
two palestinians apparently by israeli civilians who opened fired 
after their cars were stoned israeli and arab reports said 
the deaths raised to 631 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis during the twoyear uprising against israeli rule at 
least 155 other palestinians have been killed by their fellow arabs 
who accused them of cooperating with israeli authorities or 
involvement in prostitution or drugdealing fortythree israelis 
also have died 
in gaza city a military court sentenced four palestinian men to 
prison terms ranging from 10 to 14 years for throwing firebombs at 
military patrols in april 1989 a military spokesman said no one 
was injured in the attacks 
in jerusalem police said they detained for questioning at least 
21 palestinian youths after the funeral of 17yearold joseph 
albert muneir turned into a nationalist demonstration 
muneirs family claims he died sunday as a result of beatings by 
israeli soldiers but a police investigation reported he died of 
natural causes 
about 500 arab youths marched behind muneirs coffin singing 
the palestinian national anthem and waving the outlawed red white 
black and green palestinian flag nearly 100 police and 
paramilitary border policemen stood guard 
israels military administration of the occupied territories 
ordered the united nations relief and works agency unrwa to keep 
the 90 schools it operates for palestinian refugees in the occupied 
west bank closed until the new academic year begins jan 10 
a spokesman for the administration said all 930 schools in the 
west bank will remain closed until then 
the schools have been closed since the school year ended nov 1 
unrwa had announced its schools would reopen monday to give 
students a chance to complete the past academic year the students 
were unable to complete the full year because many schools have 
been closed frequently during the uprising

after four years of disagreements the 
international monetary fund announced monday it has reached an 
accord with peru that could mean financial aid for the country if 
peruvian policies meet its approval 
an official of the fund who spoke on condition he not be named 
said peru had made a payment of 423 million the 800 million it 
owes the fund the payment covers only the arrears since september 
of this year 
peru has been in trouble with lenders since president alan 
garcia was elected in 1985 and announced that he would make only 
partial payments of interest on the countrys debts at that time 
peru owed 14 billion abroad now the figure is closer to 20 
billion 
its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing 
rebellion of a strong leftist group the shining path and a 
thriving traffic in drugs 
owned by 152 governments the fund negotiates at length with 
those in financial trouble it gives its help only when the 
borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves 
usually these include cuts in government spending especially on 
official payrolls and subsidies and often a devaluation of the 
countrys currency 
peru is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of 35 billion 
to the fund and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it and 
in practice unlikely to get much from anyone else this year the 
fund started a series of what it called shadow programs under 
which governments promised new policies but got no immediate money 
vietnam guayana zambia somalia and now peru have started such 
programs 
if the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so they 
will start getting its financial help

luis arce gomez was flown to the miami on 
monday for trial on charges of trafficking in drugs while he was 
interior minister in a former bolivian military government 
he has been accused of leading a cocaine trafficking operation 
while he was bolivias top law enforcement official he also hired 
nazi war criminal klaus barbie to advise paramilitary forces that 
tortured and killed opposition political and labor figures 
a us indictment in miami alleges that bolivian secret police 
under his control seized cocaine from traffickers who failed to pay 
for protection and delivered it to smugglers who did pay 
two lieutenants of arce gomez who were charged with him once 
received 15 million for cocaine that was confiscated by bolivian 
authorities and stored in bank vaults according to the indictment 
it says arce gomez personally ordered the cocaine released 
he was indicted along with 18 other individuals and charged 
with various violations of the criminal drug laws of the united 
states said diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys 
office in miami 
specifically the charges involved conspiracies related to the 
importation distribution and intent to distribute narcotics she 
said 
arce gomez had a reputation for ruthlessness and for personally 
torturing political prisoners 
he was named interior minister in 1980 and rounded up hundreds 
of journalists political and labor leaders and church officials 
under us pressure he was removed from office in 1981 
arce gomez fled to argentina in 1982 and was arrested under the 
miami indictment but the military government there freed him in 
december 1983 just before turning over power to the civilian 
administration of president raul alfonsin 
his whereabouts were not known until he was captured sunday at a 
ranch near santa cruz a hub for drug traffickers 350 miles east of 
la paz he offered no resistance when hundreds of police officers 
arrived at the ranch 
us ambassador robert gelbard told the associated press we 
think it was a couragous act by the bolivian government to capture 
this man who not only was and is an important cocaine trafficker 
but was also responsible to a great extent for the growth of the 
cocaine trade 
sen orrin g hatch a utah republican said monday at the end 
of a oneday visit to bolivia we are pleased that criminals like 
this are being dealt with in this matter and we hope to assist in 
any way we can 
in washington the white house said in a statement bolivia 
today has apprehended and turned over to the united states luis 
arce gomez who has been a fugitive from us justice since 1983 
gomez was wanted in the southern district of florida where he has 
been charged with two counts of drug trafficking along with 
codefendant anna de tamayo rodriguez who was recently extradited 
from colombia 
the arrest of arce gomez sends a message that the president 
will work with other goverments to pursue vigorously individuals 
who traffic in drugs 
interior minister guillermo capobianco said he had advised and 
received support from bolivias main political parties for sending 
arce gomez to miami 
arce gomez was stripped of bolivian citizenship last year for 
failing to show up for trial in this country on charges of human 
rights violations and cocaine trafficking

president bush calling drunken driving one 
of the most deadly scourges of our times promised monday to keep 
up pressures to get intoxicated drivers off the road his 
transportation secretary suggested new restrictions on alcohol 
advertising may be necessary 
their comments came at a briefing at the white house for 150 
antidrunken driving activists plus health and safety officials 
bush signed legislation declaring this national drunk and 
drugged driving awareness week and issued a proclamation saying 
as we prepare to celebrate the holidays and rejoice in the 
promise of the new year it is fitting that we pause to remember 
the perils of drinking and driving 
transportation secretary samuel skinner was peppered with 
questions before bush spoke about why the government does not raise 
excise taxes on alcohol to discourage drinking and does not 
restrict brewers and liquor manufacturers ads 
im not so sure it isnt time to revisit those issues of 
regulating advertising said skinner 
skinner said people are not going to stop drinking but said 
they must be stopped from getting behind the steering wheel 
health secretary louis sullivan was more direct telling the 
briefing that the nation should consider some form of 
restrictions on the advertising of alcoholic beverages 
bush said the public outcry in recent years against drunken 
drivers has been one of the most amazing success stories of the 
1980s 
drunken driving deaths fell 20 percent in the last six years 
although the number of miles traveled rose 25 percent bush said 
still almost 500000 americans are injured in alcoholrelated 
accidents and half the 50000 fatalities on americas highways each 
year are alcoholrelated an annual toll that would nearly fill 
the polished granite walls of the vietnam memorial bush said 
he called drunken driving one of the most deadly scourges ever 
to strike modern times and its as crippling as crack as random 
as gang violence and its killing more kids than both combined 
to those who have crusaded against drunken driving bush said 
speaking not only as president but as a father and as a 
grandfather you have my respect my admiration and my thanks 
on capitol hill meanwhile a kentucky senator urged motorists 
to turn on their headlights for three hours on the last day of 
december to remind other drivers not to drink and drive on new 
years eve 
and it will be a memorial to all those victims of drunk 
driving who will not be with us to celebrate the dawn of the new 
decade sen mitch mcconnell rky said at a news conference

be indians said police spokesman col hennie heymans he said 
police suspected a limpet mine was used the second blast was heard 
throughout downtown but police could not determine the location 
after searching for more than an hour 
no one claimed responsibility and heymans declined to speculate 
on who may have been involved 
more than 100 bombings have hit south africa since a state of 
emergency was declared in june 1986 most were blamed on the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement which is 
based in lusaka zambia and is fighting to undermine white 
domination

ordinary delivery truck that was driven into a mixedraced township 
near cape town during antiapartheid unrest

at the truck in a case that became known as the trojan horse 
incident

whether germany should reunite

remain germans one speaker said to roared approval from some 
and boos from others what belongs together will grow together

cells of the discredited communist party be disbanded by dec 15 
other rallies took place in dresden neubrandenburg halle and 
potsdam the agency reported it said the dresden crowd also 
divided on the reunification issue 
it was the fourth week german unity was a central issue of 
leipzigs regular monday night rally 
dozens of west german flags waved in the crowd some 
demonstrators carried signs saying no fourth reich and urging 
east germans not to let their country become a west german 
plantation 
there are two real movements now said a young woman opposed 
to reunification its too bad its come to this 
in west germany zdf television said the fear of a deep 
division within the opposition is huge because of the different 
goals 
throughout the evening protesters on both sides shouted at each 
other 
reunification has become an increasingly bitter topic for east 
germanys new forum opposition group which sponsors the leipzig 
rallies new forum says reunification would mean a sellout to 
west germany 
calls for and against german unity were not the only demands 
many demonstrators warned fellow east germans against attacks and 
taking law into their own hands 
as they press their beleaguered government to carry through with 
promises of reforms east germans have increasingly been swept up

a federal judge on monday approved the 
130 million settlement of the largest desegregation case in 
arkansas history but blasted school districts for suggesting the 
money be used to retire debts 
us district judge henry woods saying it was abundantly 
clear the parties in the case could not be trusted with the 
money ordered it put in an escrow account monitored by a 
courtappointed supervisor 
the amount of money is meager enough woods wrote in his 
opinion 
the judge also scaled back naccp attorneys fees in the case 
from 315 million to 850000 
the settlement ends seven years of litigation involving the 
state three school districts in pulaski county which includes 
little rock and black students parents 
the little rock school district which is mostly black sued the 
state and the neighboring mostly white north little rock and 
pulaski county districts alleging the defendants caused illegal 
segregation in little rock schools 
the settlement was reached in march in a special session in 
july the state legislature agreed to spend 12975 million over 10 
years for desegregation programs 
woods on monday endorsed the agreement as approved oct 4 by 
special master aubrey mccutcheon 
attorneys for the county and north little rock districts had 
objected to revisions recommended by mccutcheon saying the court 
should accept the settlement intact 
mccutcheon recommended that the court have the right to order 
the construction or repair of magnet schools and that court forbid 
the districts from spending settlement money to retire deficits 
unrelated to desegregation 
woods said monday that the districts had no right to challenge 
the courts jurisdiction because theyd failed to draft a 
constitutional student assignment plan 
that the districts would default in their responsibilities 
then attempt to bind this court by bargaining with each other as 
to what remedies the courtappointed expert could or could not use 
is incredible he said the parties have bound themselves 
there is a settlement 
woods said his major objection was the north little rock and the 
pulaski districts suggestion that the money could be used to pay 
off debts 
woods however ruled that the little rock district had 55 
million in debts attributed to desegregation that could be paid 
with settlement money and that the pulaski county district had 14 
million in such debts 
the judge refused to grant 23 million in attorneys fees the 
settlement assigned to the legal defense fund of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
he said the little rock district shouldnt pay 2 million to the 
defense fund because the district played the leading role in 
pressing the lawsuit no substantial documents or time records were 
filed to support the claims and the defense fund tried to recoup 
fees going back to 1957 
in 1957 thengov orval faubus refused to allow nine black 
students to enter little rocks allwhite central high school 
president eisenhower ordered federal troops to central high to keep 
the peace and enforce courtordered desegregation

campaigning for elections to pick a 
successor to military president augusto pinochet ended late monday 
when tens of thousands of supporters held a street rally for 
progovernment candidate hernan buchi 
both supporters and opponents of buchi skirmished briefly with 
police at the end of the demonstration and authorities used water 
cannon to scatter the crowds from downtown streets there were no 
reports of injuries or arrests 
chileans vote thursday for a president and congress to replace 
the rightwing government of pinochet who has ruled since seizing 
power in a violent 1973 coup by law all campaigning had to end 
monday 48 hours before election day 
supporters of buchi a 40yearold former finance minister for 
pinochet packed several blocks of a downtown avenue on a warm 
spring night in the southern hemisphere and cheered as the 
candidate predicted an upset victory 
we are going to give them a big surprise he told the crowd 
buchi is considering an underdog to opposition candidate 
patricio aylwin who holds a lead of about 20 percentage points in 
most preelection polls 
aylwin a christian democrat who is backed by a coalition of 17 
centrist and leftist parties held his final rally on sunday 
drawing hundreds of thousands of people to the citys biggest park 
police said they had no immediate estimate of the buchi rally 
turnout which appeared much smaller than that of aylwin buchis 
campaign chief pablo baraona declined to give an estimate 
in his speech buchi pledged that if elected we will have a 
real democracy with a government that will listen to the people 
he criticized aylwins willingness to accept support from 
leftist groups and predicted that if aylwin wins the country 
would return to the social disorder that marked the elected 
government of former president salvador allende a marxist who died 
during the 73 coup 
the crucial option in the election is not between left and 
right but between moving ahead or moving backwards 
when the rally ended participants marched into the center along 
the main bernardo ohiggins avenue toward the presidential palace 
police halted their progress blocks away and used water cannon to 
disperse them as well as to spray youths who were taunting the 
buchi supporters 
police have said they would treat both pro and antigovernment 
elements equally during an election period they said would be free 
and fair 
pinochet was obliged to call the election when he lost a 
referendum last year on a proposal that he remain in power until 
1997 he has vowed to stay on as commander of the countrys 
powerful 60000man army after the new government takes power march

croatia the second largest state in 
yugoslavia for the first time demanded monday that a multiparty 
political system be set up in this communist country 
until now the liberal northern state of slovenia had been the 
only one of yugoslavias six constituent republics to openly 
advocate introduction of westernstyle democracy 
the communist leadership of serbia the most populous state with 
42 percent of yugoslavias 23 million people vigorously opposes 
the change croatia has about 20 percent of the population 
the state department said in washington on monday that it was 
worried by rising tensions in yugoslavia and urged the people to 
unite in support of the reform efforts of prime minister ante 
markovic 
stanko stojicevic head of the croatian communist partys ruling 
presidium politburo said monday that communists have been slow 
in realizing the historic exhaustion of the singleparty system 
in a keynote speech opening a regional party congress in the 
croatian capital of zagreb stojicevic said there can be no 
democratic socialism without political pluralism based on the right 
of association and competition of political movements and 
programs 
the speech was carried by the state news agency tanjug 
about a dozen independent movements and parties have been set up 
in slovenia the past year and the region plans to hold its first 
free legislative elections next march 
about 25000 croatians in several cities signed a petition 
sunday urging legalization of numerous parties that would make it 
possible to hold free elections in the croatian republic which

seeking to silence the debunkers the national 
geographic society laid out the results of a years investigation 
monday in an attempt to prove that adm robert e peary discovered 
the north pole exactly where and when he said he had 
pearys grandson edward peary stafford a retired navy 
commander said doubters still willing to dispute pearys claim 
should join the flat earth society 
the family is vindicated stafford declared 
national geographic president gilbert grosvenor said the results 
of the analysis by the navigation foundation an organization of 
scientists should end an 80year dispute over pearys claim 
but he said he suspected doubters would persist as they have 
for 80 years 
the foundation said it had established that the dog sleds led by 
peary had come at least within five miles of his destination on 
april 6 1909 close enough to deserve his title as the poles 
discoverer 
but baltimore astronomer dennis rawlins said he remained 
convinced peary had not gotten within 100 miles of the north pole 
rawlins is the author of a 1973 book which says peary perpetuated 
the greatest scientific hoax of the century 
he said the foundation which conducted the research at the 
behest and the expense of the geographic society had produced a 
whitewash 
bias can do a lot and when you want to believe something it 
is easy to rawlins said it is a tragedy for american 
science 
at a 95minute news conference retired adm thomas d davies 
president of the foundation said pearys claims were supported by 
scientific means 
among these he said were a study of the shadows in pearys 
photographs and of the depth measurements the explorer made by 
dropping a piece of lead tied to piano wire in holes in the ice 
modern maps verify pearys depth soundings davies said 
our analysis of the data peary brought back from his journey 
his celestial sights his diary his ocean sounding and his 
photographs has convinced us that their final camp named camp 
jesup was no more than five miles from the pole allowing for some 
inaccuracy in their instruments the foundation said in a 
240page report 
from the start pearys claim that he and companion matthew 
henson and four eskimos reached the pole has been wrapped in 
controersy 
a week before peary got home another explorer frederick cook 
said he had beaten peary by a year a claim that generated 
inchhigh newspaper headlines cooks claim was eventually rejected 
and congress certified peary as the discoverer in 1911 
but the issue reopened in 1983 when a television docudrama gave 
the credit to cook 
then came rawlins with a new claim of proof that peary had never 
made it he cited a worksheet bearing what he thought were pearys 
compass readings 
the foundation investigated and said the numbers were readings 
from chronometers made on an earlier expedition rawlins admitted 
he was wrong 
but on monday he still insisted that peary had missed 
the photo analysis cited by davies used a technique that 
determines the angle of the elevation of the sun from the shadows 
in the picture with knowledge of the dates and times when the 
pictures were made the photographers location can be determined 
we regard the photogrammetric analysis of the photographs as 
the most innovative and significant contribution thus far made to 
the dispute the foundation said 
british explorer wally herbert concluded in 1988 that peary had 
not taken account of westward ice drifts which would have put him 
55 or 60 miles away from his destination but the foundation said 
its study of arctic ice drift flows showed that herbert had not 
taken into account a subsequent rapid eastward movement of the ice

foreign ownership of us factories banks and 
other businesses has escalated in recent years but most fears 
about adverse economic consequences from foreign control are 
unwarranted concludes a study released monday by a washington 
research group 
the institute for international economics said that contrary to 
some arguments the growth of foreign ownership has not translated 
into a loss of jobs for americans and that foreignowned firms paid 
their us workers the same as domestic firms 
the institute argued against changing any us laws to block 
foreign investment saying that even in the area of national 
security the growth of foreign ownership was not of concern 
even with the recent growth in foreign ownership foreign 
firms play a smaller role in the us economy than in the canadian 
and major european economies wrote the authors of the report 
paul krugman an economics professor at the massachusetts institute 
of technology and edwin m graham a business professor at duke 
university 
the study said that foreign firms accounted for 7 percent of 
total us employment in manufacturing in 1986 compared to 21 
percent in france 14 percent in britain and 13 percent in west 
germany by contrast foreignowned firms employed only 1 percent 
of manufacturing workers in japan a country with a tradition of 
making foreign investment difficult 
if one country invests heavily in another country which 
country has given the most hostages krugman asked at a news 
conference where the report was released japan is going to find 
that it has a very great stake in what the us government decides 
when it discovers that it has a rather large part of its national 
wealth invested inside the us borders 
the new report foreign direct investment in the united 
states analyzed the rapid growth in foreign direct investment 
to count as foreign ownership the foreign firm must own at least 
10 percent of a us business 
the heavy purchases by foreigners in particular the japanese 
have triggered concern in congress and elsewhere that the united 
states is selling off its economic destiny to foreigners 
the commerce department reported that foreign direct investment 
in us real estate and businesses totaled 3289 billion in 1988 
the first year that foreign direct ownership in the united states 
surpassed us ownership overseas which totaled 3269 billion 
while britain continued as the country with the largest stake in 
the united states holding 31 percent of total foreignheld assets 
japan climbed into the no 2 spot with 162 percent of the total 
ahead of the netherlands which held 149 percent 
while purchases of prime real estate and hollywood movie studios 
by the japanese grabbed the headlines the most dramatic inroads by 
the japanese have come in banking according to the institutes 
study 
it reported that the japanese in 1988 controlled 522 percent of 
the us banking assets held by foreign banks far ahead of the 
second biggest foreign holder canada which controls 71 percent 
the institute said that growing foreign leadership in 
hightechnology industries posed new problems in meeting us 
military needs as a partial solution the study proposed making it 
mandatory for foreign companies making sales to the pentagon to 
establish manufacturing plants in the united states 
the institute for international economics is a nonprofit 
research institute created in 1981 through a grant from the german 
marshall fund of the united states an independent endowment 
created by the west german government it now receives 15 percent 
of its funds from the german marshall fund with other resources 
coming from us foundations including the ford foundation and the 
william and flora hewlitt foundation

former gov richardo bordallo was resentenced 
tuesday to four years in federal prison and fined 10000 for 
witness tampering and conspiracy to obstruct justice 
bordallo who served as governor of this us territory in the 
western pacific from 1982 to 1986 was convicted in 1987 of 10 
counts and sentenced to nine years in prison for allegedly 
exchanging political favors for payoffs but a federal appeals 
court last year reversed eight of those counts and set aside the 
sentence 
bordallo who turned 62 on monday will pay his own way to the 
us mainland and report to the federal prison once the bureau of 
prisons has made an assignment said bordallos attorney howard 
trapp 
mike cruz of the federal probation office here said 
notification of where bordallo is to report could come in as little 
as two weeks 
bordallo who met briefly with supporters outside the courtroom 
but declined to talk to reporters remains free on his own 
recognizance 
during his trial federal proseuctors said bordallo approved 
government contracts and permits for various firms in exchange for 
payments mostly delivered to him in unmarked envelopes 
the money was described by the donors as campaign contributions 
or gifts but never was reported by bordallo in his campaign 
statements authorities said 
he also was accused of approving a 103000 government contract 
for a company that agreed to hire his campaign manager 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals said four briberyrealted 
convictions were reversed because the federal crime of bribery 
applies only to state officials and guam is a territory 
it said four extortionrelated convictions were reversed because 
the jury was not told it must find bordallo demanded or otherwise 
inducted the payoffs totaling 79600 in cash 
the appeals court upheld the convictions of witness tampering 
and conspiracy to obstruct justice 
us district judge cristobal duenas resentenced bordallo to

a canadian naval destroyer monday fired a shot 
across the bow of an american scalloper that allegedly rammed it 
three times coast guard officials said 
the 366foot destroyer sagueny fired a 3inch round at 652 pm 
near georges bank after chasing the 114foot scalloper concordia 
for eight hours said petty officer ellen harrington 
the concordia did not stop or attempt to make radio contact 
after the warning shot was fired said harrington she said the 
vessel continued to steam west towards cape cod and its home port 
of fairhaven 
the sagueny followed it until 850 pm when it entered us 
waters 
the scalloper was allegedly spotted fishing 25 miles across the 
hague fisheries line by a canadian aircraft said harrington 
the hague line divides us and canadian waters was established 
by the world court in 1984 there have been several reports this 
year of american fishing boats crossing the line to the rich 
fishing area on the canadian side 
lt doug maybee a canadian forces spokesman said the sagueny 
began tracking the concordia after it was spotted fishing in 
canadian waters on five occasions during the weekend 
the smaller boat allegedly disregarded radio messages before it 
eventually turned toward sagueny and stuck the right rear quarter 
three times maybee said no injuries or serious damage were 
reported 
options are being weighed by the political masters in ottawa 
as to what the next step should be he said it is 
allimportant that a kneejerk reaction be avoided 
the coast guard was expected to board the craft when it reached 
us waters harrington said we will document the vessels 
catch check charts and records and varify the identities of the 
master and crew she said 
harrington said the concordia will be allowed to proceed to its 
home port after the boarding was completed and any further action 
would have to be initiated by the canadian government 
maybee declined to detail what kind of punitive action could be 
taken in the alleged ramming about 130 miles off cape cod 
harrington said the coast guard had no plans to intervene 
adding canadian ships dont usually pursue the american fishing 
fleet inside american waters unless they get permission from 
diplomatic channels 
the coast guard has been monitoring the situation abiding its 
policy of not interfering with canadian law enforcement

a chartered jetliner carrying 51 vietnamese 
their dreams of starting a new life abroad shattered by their 
expulsion from hong kong landed in hanoi early tuesday 
they were the first vietnamese boat people to be repatriated 
against their will by hong kong some screamed for help as they 
were taken from camp 
governmentfunded radio television hong kong reported the cathay 
pacific tristar landed at the vietnamese capital without incident 
it quoted an unidentified vietnamese foreign ministry official as 
saying thousands more vietnamese living in refugee camps in hong 
kong will be returned home within weeks 
about 56000 vietnamese who arrived in hong kong by boat are 
held in squalid camps nearly 44000 are considered illegal 
immigrants and are to be sent home unless they can prove 
persecution awaits them 
the tristar left this british colony at 509 am two hours 
after riot police entered a detention center removed the 
vietnamese and took them to the the airport under tight security 
and cover of darkness 
put on the plane were eight vietnamese men 17 women and 26 
children a government spokeswoman said insisting on anonymity 
repatriation has taken place everything went smoothly 
in london the international human rights group amnesty 
international condemned the repatriation and appealed to prime 
minister margaret thatcher and the governor of hong kong to halt it 
the british foreign office early tuesday would said only that 
the first involuntary repatriations passed off without difficulty 
foreign secretary douglas hurd is to make a statement on the issue 
in the commons later tuesday 
on monday visiting us secretary of state james a baker iii 
repeated us reservations about the repatriations during a meeting 
with mrs thatcher at her official 10 downing st residence 
some vietnamese shrieked for help from windows of the detention 
camp as the operation began at 3 am others held signs through the 
metal bars that said where is your humanity 
police equipped with helmets shields revolvers and batons 
quickly pulled them away 
i dont want to go back to vietnam a woman shouted in 
broken cantonese the dialect of hong kong waving her hands in 
despair 
a convoy of police vans took the vietnamese from the phoenix 
house detention center to the airport some boat people cried as 
they were taken away others waved at reporters 
about 175 police and corrections officers were involved 
outnumbering the vietnamese at least 31 reporters saw no evidence 
of violence 
what appeared to be the same vans later pulled up to the jet on 
the airport tarmac but reporters watching from the roof of a 
nearby building could not see people boarding 
the united states argues that conditions first must improve 
inside the communist country before there is repatriation 
britain claims the program is necessary to deter more boat 
people from fleeing to overcrowded hong kong about 600 miles 
northeast of hanoi 
on monday radio television hong kong quoted a vietnamese 
official as saying hanoi would insist force not be used and would 
accept only those who did not resist repatriation 
according to the radio report vietnam agreed more people must 
be repatriated than the 636 who returned voluntarily it quoted the 
official as saying those returning would not be punished 
the un high commissioner for refugees monitors the boat people 
who have returned voluntarily but has refused to take part in the 
forced repatriation 
so far nearly 6800 vietnamese screened by hong kong 
immigration officials have been rejected as refugees in 1988 hong 
kong decided to treat arriving boat people as illegal immigrants as 
a means of stopping the mass influx 
hong kong officials said the vietnamese were arriving much 
faster than they could be resettled overseas and most were fleeing 
poverty not persecution 
boat people continued to arrive more than 34000 from jan 1 to 
nov 10 officials say it is important to begin the involuntary 
repatriation before the next sailing season in the spring 
opponents of forced repatriation argued it could trigger 
violence in the detention centers and lead some to try suicide 
the hong kong government spokeswoman said that as of early 
tuesday she had received no reports of trouble at the camps

the new york national guards spokesman on 
monday challenged a report that the guard intentionally counted 
noshow troops to get more federal money and said it is clearing 
out its deadwood 
we take sharp exception to this lt col peter kutschera 
said following mondays report in the new york post to imply 
that this is a sham or conscious effort to mislead the pentagon 
isnt borne out by the facts 
gov mario cuomos spokesman steve villano said the state 
inspector general is looking at it and because of this pending 
investigation it would be inappropriate for us to comment any 
further villano said other investigations had been conducted 
the post said noshow soldiers had been kept on the guards 
rosters for at least six years giving the pentagon the false 
impression that the guard is ready for war or national disaster 
kutschera said he was particularly disturbed by the assertion 
that the guard was not prepared for war and said a vast number 
had been judged to be combatready 
asked how many units were combatready he replied thats 
very close to being classified information 
the post said the new york guards budget has tripled to 390 
million a year since 1975 despite having the second worst 
attendance record in the nation 
the newspaper said it determined that vito castellano guard 
commander from 1975 to 1986 created a phantom force in 1984 
castellano who reportedly retired under pressure was released 
from prison in july after serving a year for taking bribes and 
using his position to lobby for wedtech a defunct defense 
contractor 
the post said a highranking guard official who asked not to be 
further identified said he followed castellanos orders to list 
2500 phantom soldiers on the roster 
the post citing a confidential draft report prepared for 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau also said castellano 
admitted to prosecutors two years ago that he put phantom soldiers 
on the guards roster 
there was no answer at a suburban telephone listed under 
castellanos name his former attorney edwin silberling no longer 
practices law and did not know how to reach castellano 
the post said 1600 to 4000 noshow new york guard soldiers 
remain absent without leave and should be dismissed 
noshows are not paid but the post said the pentagon provides 
funds for their equipment and training 
kutscher said that was not true federal money for equipment 
allocated to the national guard is not based on drill attendance 
but on the authorized level of equipment in the organization 
itself he said

vice president dan quayle said monday the 
united nations should repeal its odious 1975 resolution that 
equates zionism with racism in an effort to promote the middle east 
peace process 
he also gave secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar a check 
for 65 million in partial payment of major us arrears an issue 
that has stirred antius sentiment here un officials said the 
united states now owes 365 million for the regular budget and 153 
million for peacekeeping 
repealing this resolution would reestablish the stature and 
moral authority of the un quayle told reporters after a 
50minute meeting with the un chief 
now is the time to begin discussion on substituting or getting 
rid of this odious resolution which equates zionism with racism 
quayles comments came in answer to questions 
the resolution is symbolic and not binding but has been a sore 
point with the united states and its ally israel us and israeli 
diplomats said that killing the resolution or declaring it null 
and void could enhance the middle east peace process by removing 
an israeli objection to un involvement 
the general assembly resolution was backed by israels arab 
rivals the soviet union and much of the movement professing 
nonalignment with either superpower quayle said it should be 
declared null and void 
francois giuliani spokesman for the secretarygeneral later 
said the un chief had no comment it is up to the member states 
and general assembly to decide he told reporters at a daily 
briefing 
he said no resolution has ever been rescinded or repealed but 
that the 159nation general assembly can innovate if it wishes to 
do so 
resolutions are part of the permanent record and cannot be 
repealed or erased un diplomats said however substitute 
resolutions can be presented and previous resolutions by a 
majority vote can be declared void and no longer representative of 
the majoritys sentiments 
quayle said the soviet union and other countries can be very 
helpful in the matter of repeal the soviet union changed its 
traditional vote this year and for the first time supported 
accepting israels credentials in the general assembly 
quayle was asked how repeal would promote palestinian rights he 
said that renouncing the resolution would help human rights in the 
occupied territories and send a positive signal about the middle 
east peace process 
quayle told reporters he had a very good and candid 
discussion with the un chief on a number of issues including 
the ussoviet summit in malta allegations of cuban violations of 
human rights forthcoming nicaraguan elections and the central 
american peace process 
he said he briefed perez de cuellar on the malta meeting he 
said he told him cuba is becoming more isolated he said cuban 
president fidel castros criticism of perestroika or reform in 
the soviet union is an indirect criticism of soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
the united states last week suffered a setback on middle east 
issues after it threatened to cut off all funding to the united 
nations if the world body upgraded the status of the palestine 
liberation organization as an observer state instead of an 
observer group 
the issue was defused and the question was put off but 
antius sentiment remains the general assembly later adopted a 
package of proplo antiisrael resolutions an annual event

the bush administration plans to propose that 
generic drug companies pay user fees to help beef up government 
regulation of an industry reeling from a bribery and fraud scandal 
sources say 
the plan drafted by the food and drug administration would 
impose registration fees on generic drug makers and charge them 
another fee for each application they file said a source who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity 
the fees would raise about 18 million as part of a 144 million 
package of fda fees the administration plans to propose in its 
fiscal 1991 budget the source said 
the bush administration like the reagan administration favors 
user fees because they raise money without raising taxes plans to 
extend these fees to the drug industry have been proposed before 
only to be axed by opponents on capitol hill

a troubled musical that never made it to broadway 
is getting a second chance in london counting on the midas touch 
of director trevor nunn 
nunn has made international hits out of cats starlight 
express and les miserables now he has turned his attention 
to the bakers wife an american show which closed on the road 
over a decade ago and has yet to be seen on broadway 
i really do think it can give pleasure i know that it can 
work said nunn during rehearsals before the show opened nov 27 
to mixed reviews 
based on marcel pagnols 1938 french film la femme du 
boulanger with music and lyrics by stephen schwartz pippin 
godspell and a book by joseph stein fiddler on the roof 
the musical is playing at the phoenix theater 
sharon lee hill who is married to nunn plays the eponymous 
bakers wife an adulterous young bride in 1930s provence in 
southern france 
alun armstrong the original innkeeper thenardier in les 
miserables is the cuckolded french baker and drue williams 
plays the proverbial other man 
the original production starring topol in his american stage 
debut opened in los angeles in the summer of 1976 by the time it 
closed in november at the kennedy center for performing arts in 
washington it had been through so many rewrites directors and 
cast changes that its creators forbade the show to move to broadway 
it was meant to open at the martin beck theater the week of nov 
15 as thenproducer david merricks 90th broadway show 
by that time we felt the show was not ours any longer 
recalled stein traumatic is a little too strong a word it was a 
painful experience 
the show we are now opening is very much the show we had hoped 
to have originally the 77yearold stein added that it has 
affinities to his two biggest hits fiddler on the roof 1964 
and zorba 1968 
its about how an experience of some people in a village 
changes the community said stein whose last broadway show was 
the illfated 1986 rags with teresa stratas 
its like fiddler and zorba in that this is a community of 
very simple rather rudimentary people with elementary passions 
both comedic and serious 
nunn said both stein and schwartz had to be talked into 
reapproaching their show it was a wound they didnt necessarily 
want to reopen and therefore being true to the material has been 
the most important task 
i felt if ever stephen and joe thought again that those people 
presenting the show were being random were being panicked were 
concerned with results rather than intentions then their hearts 
would be broken 
his company homevale ltd has an undisclosed investment in the 
production as does broadway producer james m nederlander 
nunn first encountered the music from the bakers wife at 
broadway auditions for cats in 1982 he heard it again three 
years later at new york auditions for starlight express and 
les miserables 
the show was recorded privately following its prebroadway run 
with paul sorvino and patti lupone singing the main roles its 
bestknown number the lilting meadowlark is featured on sarah 
brightmans new album the songs that got away 
nunn acknowledged the bakers wife marks a change from his 
past spectaculars its a traditional broadway book musical 
i myself hugely enjoy that moment where music enters and theres a 
frisson a wonderful tingle 
the director has staged two other london shows this year andrew 
lloyd webbers musical aspects of love and shakespeares 
othello with ian mckellen and willard white 
aspects of love is scheduled to open april 3 on broadway 
but nunn feels its too early to say whether the bakers wife 
will follow suit 
the show has a wonderful community feel he said but 
thats not at all the same as the considerations that come in to 
doing something on broadway where everyone says yeah but is it 
new is it revolutionary is it the talk of the town

rasheed araeen was shocked to find nearly 1400 
years of islamic civilization reduced to two pages in the story 
of art a standard english textbook 
so the pakistanborn sculptor organized the first exhibition of 
exclusively black and asian immigrant art ever to be shown at a 
major london gallery 
called the other story afroasian artists in postwar 
britain the exhibition opened nov 30 at the hayward gallery 
featuring the work of 24 artists from china guyana india 
jamaica japan lebanon nigeria pakistan philippines south 
africa sri lanka and tanzania three are the britishborn children 
of immigrants 
araeen 54 came to britain from pakistan in 1964 as a civil 
engineer and became a fulltime sculptor four years later he won 
his first prize in 1969 he sees the show at the hayward gallery 
which runs through feb 4 as a triumph 
it was a hard struggle to put it on i have been trying for 11 
years he said in an interview 
in 1978 he first took the idea to the arts council which 
distributes government subsidies for the arts and helps fund the 
hayward gallery they said the time wasnt right 
i kept pestering them araeen said i went back in 1982 
and they still said no two years later my autobiography making 
myself visible was published and in 1987 i started bringing out 
a journal of our art called third text i think all that helped as 
well as getting work into exhibitions in britain and abroad 
it takes time to understand perhaps they needed the time 
government policy has changed 
the show is vivid and colorful but some themes such as racism 
usually arentt shown in exhibits that make it to the mainstream 
london galleries 
some exhibits are funny li yuan from china in his participation 
art invites visitors to remove magnets from revolving metal plates 
and reposition them iqbal geoffrey from pakistan lines up 11 rat 
traps which have caught tornup pieces of reproductions of 
paintings and calls the work in search of an ideal landscape 
the most striking exhibit is a 5foottall elmwood carving of a 
male head and torso by the late ronald moody a jamaican who used 
the woods natural whorls to emphasize the parts of the face and 
body 
araeen insists the immigrants work is not inherently different 
from european art 
it was our inspiration to be part of something global we 
dont want separation of cultures he said 
the catalog prints the firstever chronology of immigrant art in 
britain starting from 1941 and interspersed with incidents of 
racism it accuses british dealers and exhibition organizers of 
neglecting nonbritish artists 
however brian sewell the toughest of london art critics wrote 
in the sunday times that the immigrant artists work is largely 
ignored by critics and dealers because it is not good enough 
sewell felt the artists are influenced by western imagery and 
if they wish to be seen as a match for the english whites whom 
araeen derides as privileged then he should relish the competition 
and comparison inevitable in a mixed exhibition 
says araeen there are 14 million noneuropeans in europe now 
compared to not even 1 million before world war ii decolonization 
has led to india for example producing highcaliber scientists 
doctors and engineers in the united states and europe so why not 
artists they too look for places to fulfill their ambitions and 
develop their ideas its not easy to do that in poverty 
racism exists it functions at all levels if there is 
discrimination in jobs there is in art as well 
andrew dempsey deputy director of the hayward said the work 
belongs to british contemporary art and is part of the history of 
art in england 
prices of the works on show run from 150 to 47000

although christmas in america a love 
story reflects parts of kenny rogers own life it was written 
before he was signed to star in the nbc special 
the onehour show on wednesday tells the story of an 
internationally famous photographer who reflects on his life and 
uses the opportunity to heal the wounds between himself and his 
son the son felt his father had always put his career ahead of his 
family 
rogers although best known as a singer and actor is also an 
acclaimed photographer and recently patched up relations with his 
own son kenny rogers jr who costars in the special as the son 
kate reid and ashley crow are also in the show 
we sent him the script to read said earl hamner who 
cowrote the show with donald sipes i was delighted when i 
learned he was not only a photographer but a good photographer 
kenny felt he had neglected his own son and had an estrangement 
sipes said i think the feeling of the film is one of healing 
and coming together which was reflected in kennys own 
relationship with his son 
when the project got under way hamner and sipes were asked to 
come up with a story about four periods in a mans life 
don and i came up with the idea of making him a 
photographer said hamner that way we could use photos to 
introduce each period the first period is childhood when he 
becomes interested in photography the next is young manhood when 
he goes off to war and falls in love act three is his marriage and 
family and the development of his career and the conflicts it 
causes in his personal life 
the last act is about maturity and reconciliation its about 
regeneration which is so appropriate for this time of year an 
area don and i wanted to explore is something that is common to all 
of us in this society thats the work ethic and how it can cause a 
man to neglect his family 
hamner said he also felt at ease with rogers when he learned 
that hes a fisherman hamner fished the streams of his native 
virginia for many years before discovering salmon fishing 
i fish in british columbia now he said i caught a 
50pound fish up there last year thats a lifetime fish they 
canned it for me and the cans arrived just yesterday 
this is the first collaboration between hamner best known for 
creating the waltons and falcon crest and sipes a former 
entertainment executive and a published novelist 
weve known each other a long time said sipes we always 
discussed writing because we both write we both collect books and 
when we meet for lunch we arrange it near a book store after lunch 
well go and browse for a while i collect literature and earl 
collects americana 
hamner said my dream is to find a rare book and buy it for 
750 but the book store people all know the value of these 
books 
their next collaboration will be brewster place a halfhour 
drama for abc starring oprah winfrey it will be filmed in chicago 
where her talk show is based and will make its debut in april 
they are also working on several cable television projects and 
wrote a pilot last year for nbc 
brewster place is adapted from the book the women of 
brewster place and the miniseries that ran on abc hamner and 
sipes are making some changes in the concept because the miniseries 
presented such a negative image of black men 
well have much more positive images said sipes were 
adding some new characters oprah will play her character in her 
late 40s shell have to be aged and padded for the part 
hamner said he feels the television audience wants the kind of 
family programming represented by christmas in america 
the networks want people between 18 and 49 he said you 
cut out a lot of people that way suppose you do a once upon a 
time story you can attract the 1849 audience and everyone else 
too

the socialist new democrats have become the first 
of canadas three national political parties to choose a female 
leader hoping some new vitality can produce a longsought 
breakthrough to high office 
audrey mclaughlin who chose american singer tracy chapmans 
talking bout a revolution as her theme song at the partys 
convention this month was elected leader on the fourth ballot 
i stand for change she said i want to change canada 
lets seize the future and not the past 
the 53yearold latecomer to federal politics from the sparsely 
populated yukon succeeds ed broadbent who retired after 14 years 
as leader of the new democratic party 
his credibility and personal popularity had brought hopes for 
significant gains before the november 1988 national election but 
the hopes failed to materialize 
even so a gallup poll taken two months before the convention in 
winnipeg manitoba found that 47 percent of canadians believed the 
new democrats would be hurt by losing broadbent as leader twenty 
percent said his departure would help the party and 15 percent said 
it would have no effect 
broadbent delivered a farewell speech that listed policies he 
said would be in keeping with the partys social democratic 
tradition 
among them were an end to child poverty a softening of what he 
called the market economys harsh impact a diversion of military 
spending to aid for the third world and a tougher approach to 
environmental protection that would include jail sentences for 
polluters 
the way was clear for a newcomer after some of the partys best 
known figures declined to run for the leadership post mclaughlin 
was the only woman among seven hopefuls 
she has provided few specifics of what direction she will take 
as party leader speaking simply of a new vision and new approach 
to the political process she has blamed canadas free trade 
agreement with the united states for most of canadas current 
problems and said the party will oppose it again in the next 
national election which is some three years away 
the trade pact opposed by the liberal party as well as the new 
democrats took effect last jan 1 after the hardfought election 
returned prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative 
party for a second consecutive majority government 
the conservatives won 43 percent of the popular vote the 
liberals 32 percent and the new democrats 20 percent enough for a 
record 43 of the 295 seats in the house of commons 
but the popular vote level for the party known as the ndp 
didnt increase from past performances 
the new democrats strength has been in western canada and the 
party failed to make a much heralded national breakthrough into 
frenchspeaking quebec and remained of limited appeal in canadas 
atlantic coastal provinces 
mclaughlin was born and grew up near windsor ontario she 
separated from her husband in the early part of the 1970s and her 
two children were old enough to be on their own by 1979 
in what is becoming a much told story in canada she bought a 
truck that year and headed north to settle in the yukon 
her earlier career had been in social work and she worked in 
whitehorse the yukons capital as a consultant on social policy 
development she also worked as an ndp organizer and policy adviser 
she became nationally known after winning a 1987 race for the 
yukons one seat in the house of commons a seat that had been held 
by a progressive conservative for the previous 30 years 
although some skepticism has been heard in canada about whether 
the present moment in world history is a time for revitalizing a 
social democratic party mulroneys declining popularity in opinion 
polls indicates plenty of room for opposing viewpoints 
a gallup poll released nov 23 found that 26 percent of 
canadians would vote for the progressive conservatives if an 
election were held now 25 percent for the new democrats and 42 
percent for the liberals 
liberal leader john turner whose opposition to the free trade 
pact helped revitalize his party is stepping down and a successor 
will be chosen in june 
mclaughlin studied french as part of her preparations for the 
ndp leadership race and used her speaking appearances at the 
convention to show an acceptable accent if limited fluency her 
comments were considered an attempt to show that the party remains 
seriously interested in quebec

two moslem leaders in britain agree salman rushdie 
blasphemed their religion in his book the satanic verses but 
they differ sharply on what to do about it 
one noted moslem figure hesham elessawy said he wanted to go 
to iran and win a reprieve for the author but after a tehran 
newspaper said the hanging rope awaited him he stayed in 
england 
a prominent moslem kalim siddiqui supports the death sentence 
imposed on rushdie by the late iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini and thinks rushdie should be hounded perpetually until 
his book published 14 months ago is withdrawn from bookshelves 
rushdie a bombayborn moslem has been in hiding under police 
guard since feb 14 khomeini died in iran on june 3 but his edict 
endures 
siddiqui director of the moslem institute says khomeinis 
edict is unchallengeable and that rushdie got nothing less than 
he thoroughly deserved 
but while favoring the death decree absolutely he says it 
is not for moslems living in this country to break british law to 
bring rushdie to book 
elessawy chairman of the islamic society for the promotion of 
religious tolerance contends that the death sentence contradicts 
the korans teachings 
as a moslem i should really suppress the human response and 
adopt the religious response which is dont punish him leave 
him to god to punish or forgive him as he wishes elessawy said 
in an interview 
he planned a lecture tour of iran egypt and the persian gulf 
states in february to dispute khomeinis edict but canceled it when 
iran declined to guarantee his safety and its semiofficial 
newspaper kehan warned he would be hanged 
the death sentence is really a slur is something that defames 
the religion of islam elessawy maintained 
as long as the man stays in hiding well stand accused of 
putting him there and keeping him there well be regarded as 
potential killers 
elessawy said he hoped at least to remove the 52million 
bounty offered by iranian clerics for rushdies assassination by 
designating it the tactics of gangsters and not worthy of the 
islamic republic 
elessawy and siddiqui have never met elessawys group seeks 
to identify and correct causes of intolerance toward moslems 
siddiquis disseminates information on moslem political thought 
siddiqui came to britain from pakistan in 1954 elessawy came 
from egypt in 1970 both are married with three children and both 
are thoroughly westernized in appearance they share an easy humor 
and a mutual contempt 
in a booklined study at his house in suburban london siddiqui 
58 dismissed elessawy as an apologist 
totally idiotic the man is to put it mildly he said 
elessawy 43 seated in his ornamented dentists office in 
harley st londons medical row said siddiquis speeches verge on 
incitement to murder but dont let me be the judge 
in october at a moslem rally in northern england siddiqui 
called for a show of hands on whether the death sentence was just 
and virtually all 250 people in the audience were reported to have 
raised their hands a bbctv poll published the previous night 
indicated only 35 percent of britains 2 million moslems were in 
favor of the death penalty 
police are investigating whether siddiqui was guilty of 
incitement and have obtained a court order forcing the bbc to hand 
over its footage of the rally 
siddiqui complains the british media portray him as a sort of 
rabble rouser the opposite to salman rushdie as it were 
he says moslems have no choice but to protest and show that 
anyone who tries to go down the same road as mr rushdie in the 
future will be dealt with much more severely 
siddiqui wants rushdie and his publishers viking penguin to 
withdraw the book and that profits from the 12 million copies sold 
should be shared among relatives of 26 people who died in 
antirushdie riots in india and pakistan 
they should make amends and then well call it a day 
siddiqui said otherwise this is going to be an issue in 50 
years from now 
elessawy said there is not one single moslem who is not 
angered by the book but he thinks rushdie might defuse the furor 
by affixing labels to his book making clear the contents are 
fictional 
he said he met rushdie on a train two weeks before the author 
was driven into hiding and suggested the disclaimer label but 
rushdie rejected it as tantamount to an apology 
rushdie is not showing any good will at all elessawy 
added in fact hes doing the opposite hes trying to promote 
the campaign against him because he wants to sell more books 
rushdie 42 continues to write and occasionally aims barbed 
comments at his opponents 
in a book review he wrote recently for the times literary 
supplement he alluded to the public burning of his book by moslems 
with this thought to burn a book is not to destroy it one 
minute of darkness will not make us blind

while the government pursues 
racial reform on several other fronts rigid apartheid remains the 
rule at staterun schools despite a growing clamor for change 
for millions of black children schools are overcrowded or 
unavailable scores of white schools have closed because of pupil 
shortages yet the government recently rebuffed a coalition of 
white parents teachers and students who petitioned to establish 
south africas first multiracial public school 
amid all his encouraging moves president de klerk has just 
failed an acid test said the star the countrys largest daily 
newspaper no matter how compelling the reasons to amend that 
archaic policy no matter how desperate the pleas from those 
affected apartheid remains alive and kicking in the school 
system 
since taking office in midaugust president fw de klerk 
repeatedly has vowed to eliminate racial discrimination yet his 
support for segregated state schools is unwavering despite official 
figures indicating that the government spends nearly five times as 
much to educate a white pupil as a black one 
according to the minister in charge of white education piet 
clase school segregation is essential to ensure cultural and 
linguistic continuity between the home and the classroom 
the acid test referred to by the star was the fate of 
johannesburg girls high school a 102yearold institution the 
government targeted for closure because of declining enrollment 
a substantial majority of the teachers students and parents 
launched an unprecedented campaign to save the whitesonly school 
by opening it to children of the thousands of black mixedrace and 
indian families who have moved into the innercity neighborhood in 
defiance of residential segregation laws 
after hinting that it might allow a experimental multiracial 
public school the government decided instead on a compromise it 
would allow the high school to remain in operation but only as a 
private school 
the state will provide a subsidy of up to 45 percent of its 
operating costs but even so few of the current pupils are 
expected to able to afford the projected monthly fees of 100 rand 
38 
the school also is expected to lose two of its five grades 
because of financial constraints and will be able to cater to no 
more than 240 pupils although the facility has a capacity of 
nearly 700 
the creation of a private school is no victory as far as i am 
concerned said neil mcgurk a member of a provisional board of 
trustees for the new school the new school will have nothing to 
do with the old 
mcgurk the principal of a multiracial roman catholic school 
said the government tends to lower its subsidies to private schools 
with relatively high proportions of black pupils 
the state has a natural temptation to mobilize as much 
resources as possible for whites he said 
the government currently spends the equivalent of about 800 a 
year to educate a white child compared to less than 200 per black 
child this gap has been reduced from previous years but the 
government recently abandoned a 10year plan to equalize the 
percapita education spending 
in soweto the largest black township with an estimated 25 
million residents schools have been plagued by violence severe 
overcrowding shortages of textbooks poor performances on exams 
and deteriorating facilities 
in many soweto schools there are 40 to 50 pupils for each 
teacher 
the south african institute of race relations reported in 
november that 196 white schools have been closed in the past 10 
years and that remaining white schools have more than 250000 
vacant places an estimated 1 million black children have no 
schools to go to the institute said 
a handful of the closeddown white schools have been made 
available to the education departments for indians and mixedrace 
people but most have been leased to other government agencies and 
42 are unused said the institute an independent research 
organization 
given the crying need for school places for black pupils this 
is a criminal waste of a high order said a recent editorial in 
the star 
the campaign to integrate johannesburg girls high school has 
been emulated in other cities under the banner of a group called 
all schools for all people 
ahmed moonda a leader of the group said that if the state does 
not act a defiance campaign will be launched next year in which 
parents will take their children to the nearest school and demand 
enrollment 
we do not want to cause disruptions but we may be forced 
to he said the state is simply fostering illiteracy among our 
kids

in a political system that is supposed to 
thrive on competition theres something odd happening politicians 
are starting to suggest the only way to deal with really tough 
issues is under a ceasefire a truce in which they would agree to 
put unpopular votes out of campaign bounds 
one republican leader called it a suicide pact and said 
that may be what it takes to get action to rein some politically 
sacrosanct spending programs social security and veterans 
benefits were two he mentioned 
the political parties already have put one such deal into 
effect agreeing that republicans and democrats will speak no 
campaign evil of each other for supporting the twostep pay raise 
the house voted itself just before adjourning 
house leaders of both parties insisted on that pledge before the 
vote on salaries and a 1991 ban on honoraria finding at last a way 
around the political perils that have gone with raises in 
congressional pay for 200 years 
so the chairmen of the national and congressional campaign 
committees agreed the pay vote is not an appropriate point of 
criticism in the coming campaigns that will be fine with house 
memers who voted for the raise dissenters and challengers who try 
to make it an issue will risk losing the financial and technical 
support they could otherwise expect from the national campaign 
committees 
with that deal cut other topics may start to look inviting as 
prospects for nonaggression pacts 
that idea and some variations on the theme came up last week at 
a forum on congress in the 1990s sponsored by the american 
enterprise institute 
in theory the american political system and congress itself 
should work best with ideas issues candidates and officeholders 
competing in contests that produce winners force compromise and 
ultimately shape consensus 
former president gerald ford argued that side of the case at the 
aei forum saying it can work between the branches as well as 
between the parties a little conflict can bring out the best 
said ford a former house republican leader who went to the white 
house and vetoed bills at a record pace 67 of them in 2 years 
im not sure that confrontation between the white house and the 
congress is necessarily bad 
as for political competition ford said if he had the power to 
draw congressional district lines each of them would be as closely 
divided as possible with party registration split no more widely 
than 60 percent to 40 percent for the minority 
but rep steny hoyer of maryland chairman of the democratic 
conference said congressmen from closely divided districts are the 
most skittish on controversial votes he said members with 
politically safe districts may be in better shape to make the 
correct but unpopular decisions that sometimes come to a member of 
congress 
tony coelho the former democratic whip who quit the house 
earlier this year said professional aggressive congressional 
campaign committees in both parties tend to make members nervous 
about becoming a target over a potentially unpopular vote 
its very organized very controlled coelho said i was 
part of it i recognize it 
sen alan simpson of wyoming the senate republican whip said 
thats why members of congress back away from such risky positions 
as limiting social security benefit increases in order to chip away 
at the federal deficit republicans tried in 1982 and got creamed 
he said 
who the hell is going to do the heavy lifting he said 
all sides acknowledge it will take unpopular votes to make real 
reductions in the federal deficit 
nobody gets elected saying no said rep henry hyde rill 
you get elected saying yes 
it was simpson who suggested that a political truce might be a 
way to get things done by taking the sting and risk out of votes 
to cut votes to cut popular spending programs we ought to sit 
down and do the suicide pact he said agreeing members in both 
parties will go over the cliff together and wont try to punish 
each other later 
it doesnt take courage if we all do it he said

while foreign businessmen complain of 
obstacles to japanese markets travelers complain that crowded 
airports are the most frustrating barriers to getting into the 
country 
in hopes of easing the bottleneck for air travelers the 
japanese are building an island in osaka bay and plan to put an 
airport on it but few industry insiders think it will be the 
answer 
the project is moving smoothly along nevertheless in contrast 
to tokyos narita airport where riot police recently battled 
radicals who used firebombs to defend land on which a runway was to 
have been completed 15 years ago 
at narita eight farmers still grow vegetables on and around the 
planned second runway refusing to sell their land though police 
have begun to dismantle buildings erected by radicals supporting 
the farmers industry sources are doubtful the second runway will 
be completed by the end its new deadline two years from now 
for more than 20 years protests against narita have left six 
people dead the airport is surrounded by barbed wire and riot 
police it is not connected to key rail lines to tokyo 40 miles 
away 
the 7 billion kansai airport at osaka however will be out in 
the bay and not likely to generate any fights with the citys 
residents 
the airport is one of the worlds biggest civil engineering 
projects of the 1990s but it has its critics 
japan is famous for its bullet trains and sparkling subways but 
its links to the outside world international airports are 
widely considered unworthy of a great economic power 
the main link tokyos narita airport is becoming a symbol of 
japans closed nature says yasuo sakakibara an economics 
professor 
new tokyo international airport as narita is officially called 
greets passengers after long transpacific flights with crowds and 
confusion after picking up their luggage passengers get a choice 
between a 200 40mile taxi ride to tokyo or a wait of an hour or 
more for a bus 
narita handled 4 million more passengers last year than it was 
planned for all squeezing through the same number of immigration 
counters as when the airport opened in 1978 
with just one runway narita handles 17 million passengers a 
year new yorks john f kennedy airport with five runways 
handles 10 million 
the congestion is terrible says richard jurek director of 
pacific operations for northwest airlines the day narita 
opened it had already reached its comfortable capacity 
the new kansai airport an hours flight west of tokyo is 
supposed to relieve the problem when it opens in 1993 
but industry sources say the runway is too short the distance 
to osaka too far and its link highways too narrow an airport 
serving a metropolitan region that produces 2 percent of the 
worlds economic output needs at least three runways they say not 
just one three were originally planned and the ministry of 
transport is still hoping for them but the ministry of finance 
says the country can afford only one 
industry sources predict kansai airport will be full within a 
year or two of its opening they expect growth in japans 
international passengers in the next few years to nearly match the 
more than 20 percent annual growth since 1987 
today boats cruise in osaka bay where 747s will take off 
machines disgorge enough sand to fill scores of houston astrodomes 
into a box 27 miles long that will be the airports supposedly 
earthquakeproof base it is one of the deepest of manmade 
islands standing in 60 feet of water 
on it will rise an ultramodern terminal with people movers and 
indoor landscaping a twolevel bridge will carry trains and cars 
across 23 miles of water to osakas shore 
japan squeezes 122 million people half the population of the 
united states into a habitable area about the size of 
pennsylvania few of them want an airport in their backyard that 
keeps airports small and inconvenient to city centers the island 
airport will be an hours bus ride from downtown osaka 
the sand used for the island is costing more than it should 
because of pricefixing among contractors who were stiffly fined 
by japans antitrust agency the united states has charged that 
collusive business practices like the sand cartel keep out foreign 
businesses washington has made access to the airports 
construction by us companies a major trade issue with the 
japanese 
after long negotiations the airport opened bidding on 
construction and supplies to foreign firms and an italian 
architect won a design contest for the terminal building 
despite the prospect of problems ahead foreign airlines are 
lining up for flight slots at the new airport for many airlines 
the pacific and japan are the fastest growing and most profitable 
markets in the world

one of the groups composed of the cruiser exeter with 8inch 
guns and the cruisers ajax and achilles with 6inchers found the 
graf spee in the south atlantic near montevideo uruguay where the 
river plate vents to the sea each of the hunter groups was 
configured to deal with a pocket battleship but this group lacked 
another 8inch cruiser the cumberland which was refitting in the 
falklands 
the graf spee had 11inch guns with greater range and hitting 
power than the british ships even with the exeter steaming toward 
her the spee had three minutes of unimpeded barrages before she 
came into exeters range the lighter cruisers were under even a 
greater disadvantage 
the spee sought to stay at maximum range under the cover of 
smoke but it soon found itself beset from three directions the 
exeter was hit and out of control when the light cruisers finally 
came into play 
the graf spee made for the river plate under cover of smoke the 
exeter her bridge and forward guns gone was being steered from 
the emergency controls aft the ajax had lost its after turrets 
the entire engagement had taken an hour and 20 minutes the british 
ships pursued the spee to montevideo and lay to outside they were 
joined by the cumberland two days after the initial action evening 
the odds 
capt langsdorff of the graf spee notified the german admiralty 
of his plight and asked instructions on the evening of dec 17 he 
headed his ship out of the harbor and toward the waiting british 
ships some two hours later she blew herself up two days later 
langsdorff shot himself 
churchill wrote the effects of the action off the plate gave 
intense joy to the british nation and enhanced our prestige 
throughout the world the spectacle of the three smaller british 
ships unhesitatingly attacking and putting to flight their far more 
heavily gunned and armoured antagonist was everywhere admired 
not everywhere the soviet naval publication red fleet called 
it a demonstration of the impotence of the british 
meanwhile the soviets invaded finland 25 days before christmas 
but the finns would not lie down and play dead american moviegoers 
that christmas would see whiteclad finnish ski troops on their 
newsreels 
in london churchill pleaded for a softening of the blackout 
regulations which he saw as hurting the war effort and morale of 
the populace 
military objectives he said could best be attacked by daylight 
or moonlight london could be found easily by simple directional 
navigation he suggested modified lighting that was employed in 
paris that allowed enough light to see 600 yards ahead and a margin 
of safety for motorists 
there is no need to have the rosy glow as a guide and it 
would not be a guide if it were extinguished before the raiders 
leave the sea but there is not much in it anyway 
the penalty we pay for the present methods is very heavy 
first the loss of life secondly as the secretary of state for 
air has protested the impediment to munitions output and also 
work at the ports thirdly the irritating and depressing effect 
on the people which is a drag upon their warmaking capacity 
fourthly the anxieties of women and young girls in the darkened 
streets at night or on blackedout trains fifthly the effect on 
shopping and entertainments 
he cited newspaper reports of a man who was prosecuted for 
smoking a cigarette too brightly and another of a mother who was 
fined for turning on a light to care for her crying baby 
modifying to a dimout he said might help britain make it 
through the mist and fog of the three winter months with better 
morale and greater safety 
we can always revert to the existing practice if the war 
flares up or if we do anything to provoke reprisals 
the war would flare up 
before another warfree christmas day would dawn some 50 
million people would violently vanish from the face of the earth

recollection of what its like growing up as a reindeer 
</TEXT>

this time of year youll find me 
everywhere even on my home turf the north country ive become a 
profit with honor 
like today in stockholms old city im the chefs special on the 
dinner menu at the posh victory hotel renstek rudolph 
across town the food hall in the ahlens department store is 
offering samples of renklamma a delicious smoked sausage on barley 
bread coated with horseradish butter 
in chic boutiques all over scandinavia youll find me in a wide 
selection of sleeping bags gloves parkas moccasins snow boots 
with curled toes primitive masks and of course on an endless 
array of christmas cards and tree ornaments 
finnair has holiday flights to tormanen up near the border with 
the soviet union so good little boys and girls can visit 
korvatunri the cave of the ears where father christmas 
overhears petitions for presents under the tree 
now the swedes are selling condominiums to the crosscountry ski 
set in my frozen stomping ground above the arctic circle would you 
believe one of my mates got hit in the rump with an orange golf 
ball the other day while shoveling away the snow with his antlers 
to munch on some succulent lichens 
in taiwan and tokyo these antlers are pounded into a powder and 
sold as an aphrodisiac a love potion well why not at this 
festive time of the year im just about the most lovable critter 
anywhere 
in case you havent guessed im a reindeer natures noblest 
and perhaps most useful beast there are a million like me maybe 
more counting herds exported to alaska and canada 
a few christmases ago the headline writers were composing our 
epitaph that nuclear reactor explosion at chernobyl spread 
cesium137 all over our grazing territory which stretches from 
siberias kola peninsula across finland to sweden and norway 
experts grimly predicted that our winter food supply of lichens 
which have no roots and take all their nutrients from the air 
would be radioactive for 20 to 30 years to keep our herders from 
going bust the governments of norway and sweden bought up all 
contaminated reindeer meat at 1985 prices dyed it a bright blue 
sold some to the mink farms and buried the rest 
can you imagine me beloved of kids around the world winding up 
in a nuclear waste dump 
not to worry here it is another christmas and reindeer meat 
inspected and approved is back in the gourmet shops and were 
still going strong on the hoof as we have been since the stone age 
when they painted our picture in shocking pink on the wall of that 
cave in france 
in 40 centuries we havent changed much still 3 feet high 
about the size of a shetland pony and weighing in at about 300 
pounds our distinguishing features are wide deeply cleft hoofs 
for skimming across marshes and snow fields close haired 
airfilled fur to keep out the cold a hairy muzzle that serves as 
a ski mask and these velvety antlers sweeping upward backward 
and forward again into broad tips of mooselike proportions 
no other branch of the deer family equips both males and females 
with this elegant headgear none lives so far north where the snows 
are deepest and food so scarce 
to brag a bit i can run faster than a horse outdistance a pack 
of wolves float like a cork swim the swiftest rivers trot 15 mph 
with 90 pounds on my back while pulling a sled loaded with 300 
pounds and cover 40 to 50 miles a day in a blizzard 
over the years the poets painters and songwriters have been 
generous with their praise if not always accurate like when 
clement moore wrote in his classic a visit from st nicholas 
when what to my wondering eyes should appear 
but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer 
actually only seven reindeer are hitched to an akjar the sled 
loaded with grandma and the baby or maybe piled high with tents 
blankets and cooking pots for the spring and autumn migrations that 
cover hundreds of miles 
more rapid than eagles his coursers they came continued the 
poet a bit of poetic license there eagles are a menace they can 
snatch up a newborn calf quicker than a hungry bear emerging from 
his winter hibernation 
but wolverines are the real enemy these cunning cousins of the 
weasel sneak up behind a reindeer burrowing under the snow and 
pounce on his rump 
worst of all are the mosquitoes midges and gadflies that sting 
us on the muzzle causing colds and congestion and plant their 
eggs in the soft flesh under our eyelids weakening our already 
poor vision no wonder we head for the cool mountains in summer 
the christmas card artists got it right however about our 
herders being short stocky cheerful folk who wear curly toed 
boots filled with grass tall pointy hats with funny flaps and 
bright blue not red parkas elaborately trimmed with fur 
embroidery ribbons and sometimes silver

like the sled driver in that poem they do have cheeks like 
roses and a nose like a cherry youd glow like that too if 
you dashed out of a night 50 below into a sauna 220 above zero 
lapps or laplanders these rugged people are still widely called 
in sweden but in norway and finland their official name is sami 
they have their own language of remote hungarian and finnish 
origin with 120 words for snow and 400 for reindeer 
why not we reindeer are their whole life culture and history 
carbon tests on petrified slats found in tundra bogs show they have 
been chasing us on crosscountry skis since at least 2500 bc 
we are their horse sheep cow and general store available in 
one portable compact model 
tents blankets boots parkas leggings sleeping bags are 
taken out of our hide the meat strong and flavorful can be 
jerked smoked boiled or barbecued reindeer blood pancakes are an 
acquired taste our milk is four times richer than a cows great 
for butter and cheese 
bowls spoons and fish hooks are fashioned from our antlers our 
sinews contribute harnesses boot laces lassos and thread spun on 
looms fashioned from our bones which also provide knife handles 
pack racks and the babys kemse or cradle all held together with 
glue from our hoofs 
there really are reindeer games like you hear about in that 
rudolph song with dice and markers made from our toe bones the 
herders family gathers in the glow of the tent stove for a board 
game called wolf tablo a variant of chess in which the wolf 
gobbles up some reindeer pawns until he finally is cornered 
reindeer arent driven like cattle in the american west we call 
the tune instinct dictates where and when well mosey off to 
richer pastures the herder and his family just follow along 
listening for the jingle bells around our necks and the hollow 
clicking noise the herd makes on the move tendons stretching 
across our toe bones make a sound like of a bunch of schoolboys 
cracking their knuckles 
before norway established border controls in 1912 reindeer used 
to roam from the top of the gulf of bothania where finland and 
sweden meet all the way to the atlantic 
herding has changed dramatically in recent years logging 
operations in finland nato bases in norway and swedens 
unquenchable appetite for hydroelectric power have shrunk our 
traditional grazing ground 
many herders have forsaken the old nomadic ways they use 
planes helicopters and walkietalkie radios to follow our 
migrations 
in rovaniemi up on the arctic circle a finnish firm called 
rova elektro is marketing reindeer radar to replace the bells 
around our necks some herd handlers these days ride the frozen 
range on snowmobiles tinplate geldings the sami call them 
this brings up a delicate subject a few weeks ago a militant 
feminist on a tv talk show called santa a male chauvinist because 
only a token doe vixen made his starting lineup on christmas eve 
the awful truth is that all sledpulling reindeer are harkar 
geldings castration is performed at the fall roundup when the 
huge herds that summered in the mountains are sorted out by family 
ownership for breeding slaughter or sled training 
the other big reindeer roundup comes early in spring when the 
young calves still following their mothers are literally earmarked 
for owner identification 
ill never forget the last day of my childhood a lasso was 
thrown over my antlers and i was bulldogged to the ground like a 
calf at a rodeo the next thing you know the herders plump wife 
was sitting on my flanks and carving a decorative slice out of my 
ear with a hunting knife 
this snippet along with others was hung from the tent pole 
with care in the timehonored method of reindeer bookkeeping 
swedish lapland alone has more than 10000 legally registered 
reindeer earmarks all different 
rudolph the rednosed reindeer has become what tin pan alley 
calls a golden oldie among us hes strictly for laughs what 
rudolph really needed to lead the pack was a glowing taillight on 
our frequent travels through frozen mist and fog we follow the 
wagging white tail of the reindeer just ahead 
although st andrews day the last sunday in november is the 
big feast in the north country christmas is a fun time for 
reindeer the air is clean and bracing fragrant with the scent of 
the stunted pines we come gaily galloping with steam rising from 
our muzzles when the herder clangs his ice axe into the frozen snow 
to dig us out some tasty holiday tidbits 
the sun at noon is just an embarrassed blush on the horizon but 
in the diamondstudded long winter night the northern lights blaze 
purple and red and gold more dazzling than the rockefeller center 
tree 
it makes a reindeer want to sing out like santa or at least 
bark which is what we do happy christmas to all and to all a 
good night

british actress marina sirtis recently scored 
a first when she had a steamy love affair on star trek the next 
generation 
sirtis plays deanna troi the halfhuman halfbetazoid 
counselor on the popular syndicated series the back story is that 
troi and cmdr william riker played by jonathan frakes are former 
lovers 
we play a lot of stuff between us that ends up on the cutting 
room floor sirtis says the producers dont like the 
relationship too much although the fans love it the producers 
want us to be free to have dalliances with aliens 
in a recent episode troi had a love scene which was the first 
time on the show two people were shown in bed together 
we got a lot of letters saying you shouldnt have sex on star 
trek she says we touch on everything else its as though 
theres no sex in the 24th century 
despite her striking beauty jetblack hair and dark eyes 
sirtis says people seldom recognize her on the street 
im only recognized if i want to be recognized which is good 
and bad she says i look different because i wear a wig and 
big black contact lenses with a little hole for me to see through 
i get invited to functions because of the show and when i 
turn up people dont know who i am thats embarrassing especially 
if youre trying to impress someone youre with 
in person sirtis does look different her wig hair is pulled 
back severely on star trek away from the show her long dark 
hair is full and wavy shes more animated has a keen sense of 
humor and laughs more than the rather serious troi her english 
accent emerges when shes not acting 
sirtis had been in this country less than five months when she 
auditioned for the new star trek she originally auditioned for 
the role of lt tasha yar the security chief which went to denise 
crosby 
in england shed done wicked lady with faye dunaway and 
appeared opposite charles bronson in death wish iii she got a 
part in hunter two weeks after she arrived here and was also on 
the tv series the adventures of sherlock holmes 
i grew up in london my parents arrived from greece three 
months before i was born she says i blame my bad temper on 
being conceived in greece my parents attitudes were pretty 
victorian so they saw being an actress as having about the same 
respectability as being a lady of the night i was very bright in 
school and my parents had lofty ideas of me becoming a lawyer i 
think my father was quietly supportive before he passed away i 
think with star trek my mother has finally accepted it 
i came here because my looks went against me in england they 
do a lot of kitchen sink dramas about working class problems i 
was working class i had a terrible cockney accent but i couldnt 
get cast in those things they said i was too pretty too 
glamorous i was never the lead i was always the other woman 
sirtis says she had just ended a long relationship and decided 
it was time to exercise her ambitions elsewhere 
id fought too hard to become an actress because of my 
parents opposition and the environment i grew up in i felt i owed 
it to myself to do as well as i could she says 
star trek the next generation now in its third season is 
the most successful hourlong drama in syndication a sequel to the 
1960s 22nd century star trek it is set in the 24th century and 
features an allnew cast and a muchimproved starship enterprise 
like the original it was also created by gene roddenberry 
in the beginning deanna troi was a lieutenant commander in the 
star fleet she is now a civilian counselor aboard the enterprise 
who uses her unusual senses and esp to further the crews mission 
in the beginning of the series there were too many stories 
about superior beings taking over the enterprise and challenging 
the crew to some sort of test now the show emphasizes the 
relationships between the crew members and their encounters with 
strange worlds and unusual beings thats what made the original 
star trek a phenomenal hit 
the relationships are more important than plot sirtis says 
the audience wants to see the people interact gene doesnt allow 
conflicts between the crew members although i cant imagine any 
close relationship over a long period of time that doesnt have 
some conflict conflict is what an actor sinks his teeth into we 
sneak it in sometimes and hell put his foot down

richard maltby jr and david shire think of 
closer than ever their offbroadway hit now on view at the 
cherry lane theater as a collection of musical short stories 
its not a musical revue and not a book musical but 25 musical 
numbers about contemporary people and the things they do and the 
things they feel 
the characters are more threedimensional than you usually 
find in a revue says shire the curly haired softspoken half 
of the songwriting team and the stories are thematically 
related 
you find yourself moved the way that you would be moved at a 
musical or a play maltby adds i dont know anybody who ever 
was moved by a revue its not the hallmark of revues to get your 
emotions 
the four performers brent barrett sally mayes richard muenz 
and lynne wintersteller sing their hearts out 
in one wistful song called my life a woman reflects on what 
has happened to her failed marriage and faltering career in 
another a man sings about himself one of the good guys who 
thinks about the possibility of an affair but keeps true to his 
marriage in a third if i sing a son pays homage to his 
father thanking him for the success he has had in life 
much of the revue started about five years ago as an urban 
file in maltbys home computer at the time the lyricist began 
saving notes and jottings from conversations with friends most of 
them in their late 40s 
they were primarily stories our friends had told us about 
their lives maltby was saying the other day he thought they 
might make interesting subject matter for songs 
at the same time shire who lives part of the year in 
california bought new synthesizer equipment that he planned to use 
for film scoring something he has done a lot of in movieland 
when i got these new toys i went into a real improvisational 
binge to try them out the composer says because they were 
hightech i was playing around with urban sounds richard had 
said think urban so i opened up a computer file in my sequencer 
and collected a lot of music 
out of their collaboration came the songs for urban blight 
a small revue about the perils of living in new york the show 
which also had sketches by such established playwrights as 
christopher durang wendy wasserstein and terrence mcnally had a 
short run at the manhattan theater club 
but the performers were more actors than singers both maltby 
and shire felt the songs full potential hadnt been tapped and 
wanted to use them again some ended up in closer than ever 
other songs for closer than ever were orphans from baby 
the duos one broadway musical that had a sevenmonth run during 
the 198384 season 
twelve songs wound up in baby shire says but we wrote 
approximately 50 some of them deserved to be put away forever 
others were redundant but there were three or four which we were 
quite proud of and the plot ultimately didnt have room for 
material from baby and five songs from urban blight 
plus what shire calls odds and ends were ultimately pulled 
together by maltbys assistant a young director named steven scott 
smith for an evening of entertainment called next time now it 
was performed last spring by three singers at a new york cabaret 
spot called eightyeights the response was good enough to 
encourage further work 
that refinement occurred at the williamstown festival in 
massachusetts in july when maltby came aboard as codirector of the 
show new songs were written and one more performer added 
a lot of the songs are related to things in our life shire 
says our work since baby has tended to be more personal the 
things we are feeling and what our friends are feeling our 
experiences with our wives our fathers or with fatherhood for 
example 
and what could have been a grab bag of material turned into an 
evening of portraits a collection of selfcontained songs 
maltby says 
maltby and shire have been writing together for more than 30 
years they met as freshmen at yale both had musical backgrounds 
their fathers were both bandleaders 
musical theater fans know their earlier revue starting here 
starting now which had a short run offbroadway in 1977 the 
show mostly songs from unproduced maltbyshire musicals became a 
cult favorite thanks to a recording by rca victor and numerous 
productions around the country rca has recorded closer than 
ever in its entirety and will release it in january 
the two men have also worked separately and with others 
maltby was the director of the hit fats waller revue aint 
misbehavin and was colyricist for miss saigon londons 
newest musical smash which is expected on broadway in the fall he 
has also written the lyrics for nick and nora a musical 
version of the thin man also due in new york next season 
shire has written scores for more than 40 movies including 
the conversation all the presidents men and farewell 
my lovely he also picked up an oscar as composer of the song 
it goes like it goes from norma rae and hes currently 
working on a stage adaptation of joseph hellers novel god 
knows with joseph stein and barry harman 
still they have always come back to work with each other 
weve worked every way possible but mainly sitting together 
in rooms for very long periods of time being each others gadfly 
cheering section and artistic conscience shire says we throw 
away a lot of each others material 
maltby and shire worked on closer than ever right up to its 
opening in november adding a new song shortly before previews 
started and carefully going over lyrics to existing ones 
truthfully most of the songs never have a moment when they 
are done maltby says there just is a moment when you stop 
working on them then suddenly you go into rehearsal and somewhere 
along the way you realize they are in the show

carlos saul menem the president 
of argentina recalls his days growing up he his brothers and 
mother all worked in the general store of his father a moslem who 
arrived penniless from syria after the turn of the century 
he was a street vendor in a hot backwater province until he 
saved enough to buy the store menem said after several setbacks 
the business prospered and the father saul insisted his four sons 
go to college 
he instilled in us the need to study for a career said 
menem who became a lawyer provincial governor and last july was 
elected president on the peronist ticket he used to say the only 
safe thing in life was a university degree 
menem 59 typifies the arab experience not only in argentina 
but across latin america 
the descendants of tens of thousands of arabs who fled poverty 
and oppression and settled in cities and towns across latin america 
and throughout the caribbean have become figures of consequence in 
business the armed forces and increasingly politics 
some have achieved fame others notoriety 
in brazil three of the 22 candidates for president in the first 
round of elections nov 15 were of lebanese descent including 
paulo salim maluf former mayor of sao paulo 
in ecuador the lebanesedescended bucaram family has produced

the spanish and italians said ramez chacra past president of the 
federation of arab american entities 
dont think that the glory of arabs in argentina started with 
menem chacra a clothing wholesaler said good naturedly between 
phone calls sips of black coffee and instructions to employees in 
his busy store he just made us fashionable 
arabs began arriving in large numbers at the end of the last 
century waves followed the end of each of the world wars 
arab immigration really means syria lebanon palestine 
the parts of the decaying ottoman empire that were subject to 
religious discrimination military draft persecution massacre

people their warm reception said nelson hadad a lawyer and 
leading member of the arab community in santiago our 
grandparents our parents always tell us that 
monsour challita director of the gibran international cultural 
center in rio de janeiro brazil and former ambassador of the 
league of arab states said the lebanese found for the first 
time a country they could count on to protect them and a friendly 
hospitable people 
many immigrants were orthodox christians not moslems they 
mostly spoke french not arabic they assimilated easily learning 
portuguese in brazil and spanish in the other countries 
many descendants including menem were baptized as roman 
catholics the dominant religion in the region and assimilated so 
completely they do not speak or write the language of their parents 
some changed their names to lessen what discrimination there 
was or simply to fit in better alferez which means the 
horseman in arabic became alvarez in argentina in brazil 
haddad became ferreira both mean smith in their languages 
zaituni became oliveira both mean olive or olive tree 
initially the new arrivals were called turks because they 
carried turkish passports that sobriquet is inaccurate and is 
considered pejorative 
in jorge amados novel gabriela clove and cinnamon set in 
the brazilian city of ilheus gabriela is married to cafe owner 
nacib a syrian who protests violently when townspeople call him 
turk 
as brothers and cousins joined family members who arrived 
earlier the arabs quickly spread out 
social and cultural clubs are common but arab neighborhoods 
such as rua da alfandega in rio de janeiro a street lined with 
arab shops and restaurants are rare as are examples of arab 
architecture like mosques 
the arab community never has been a ghetto noted hadad the 
chilean attorney it has always been an active integrated part 
of chilean society we are chileans we feel chilean 
arabs have played controversial or highly publicized roles in 
their adopted societies

the colombian governments war on 
drugs has brought hard times to miraflores typical of the towns in 
colombia where people earn a living by growing the coca leaves that 
are processed into cocaine 
and hard times could mean social unrest in an area where 
antigovernment guerrillas operate 
when the government declared its war aug 19 the demand for 
coca leaf dried up around miraflores as traffickers disappeared to 
avoid arrest the price of coca base which is made into cocaine 
fell from 660 to 330 a kilogram 22 pounds prices have 
fluctuated since then and recently were about 475 a kilogram 
many of miraflores residents who were barely making a living 
by growing coca even when prices were high now say they have been 
pushed to the economic brink 
we ask ourselves what were going to do said david 
gonzales a coca grower i mean are we going to have to declare 
war in order to get enough food to feed our families 
authorities estimate 80 percent of miraflores 17000 people 
depend on coca cultivation for their livelihood the town 267 
miles southeast of bogota near the headwaters of the vaupes river 
can be reached only by air no roads go out from it to areas where 
farmers could sell other crops such as corn or rice 
peasants who work on the small farms owned by big coca producers 
earn the equivalent of 95 a month colombias minimum wage 
a farmer working his own one or two acres might average 7 for a 
10hour day most growers in miraflores work for others and grow 
their own coca crops as well 
authorities estimate 550 to 1100 pounds of coca leaves are 
needed to produce one kilogram of coca base the amount of leaf 
required varies with its quality and with the efficiency of the 
processing 
the antinarcotics police chief in miraflores lt edgar 
bejarano said miraflores population has decreased 30 percent in 
the past three months he and other officials attributed the exodus 
to the governments war on traffickers 
these days traffickers are all on the run said javier 
echeverry the head of the governments agricultural development 
corporation in the region since there is no one to buy coca the 
price has fallen 
any drop in the colombian coca supply probably will not affect 
cocaine availability in the united states since most coca is grown 
in neighboring peru and in bolivia 
but the colombian governments war on drugs is almost certain to 
add instability in miraflores and other cocagrowing regions in 
colombia 
roberto martinez a former grower has managed to stay in 
miraflores although he abandoned his 25acre coca field near the 
town when prices of coca first began to fall in 1983 because of 
overproduction 
he got a job as a loader with one of the cargo airlines serving 
miraflores 
martinez said most people who quit cultivating coca had not been 
so lucky the choice is often between going hungry and getting out 
they leave but they dont have anywhere to go he said 
there are no jobs for them anywhere else in colombia and many of 
them turn to crime the problems with coca are generating social 
problems 
farmers added that the influence of the revolutionary armed 
forces of colombia the countrys oldest and largest 
antigovernment guerrilla group is likely to grow in the area 
along with the economic misery 
coca grower gonzalez said people now are listening to the 
guerrillas argument that armed revolution is the only way to 
better their lives 
if the government really wants to get rid of the guerrillas 
it should do something to help us he said 
colombia produces only about one tenth of the coca grown in the 
andean region but the guaviare region encompassing miraflores 
accounts for 80 percent of colombian coca 
since no roads run to miraflores nine daily cargo flights old 
propeller driven planes are the towns only link to the rest of 
colombia 
the planes bring food liquor cosmetics almost everything the 
residents need including the gasoline they pour on coca leaves to 
extract juices 
another problem for growers is that the planes are bringing far 
less gasoline than they did three months ago bejarano whose 
police platoon controls the airstrip said he had cut gasoline 
shipments to 10000 gallons from 40000 gallons in an effort to 
slow coca base processing 
the move has angered farmers 
this is a military dictatorship down here said gonzalez 
surrounded by other growers as he talked to a reporter in a wooden 
shack that has been converted into a bar 
almost all of the men who said they grew coca expressed a desire 
to get out of the business which they say no longer is profitable 
but not much is in store for them 
in boom years growers made thousands of dollars a month but 
beginning in 1983 found themselves trying to eke out a living 
farmers could not pay their debts and lenders working for drug 
traffickers began settling scores with bullets that brought in the 
police and army reinforcements and miraflores suffered a wave of 
violence that left scores of dead every week 
even with the drop in prices communities like miraflores that 
can be reached only by plane coca is likely to be the principal 
crop for years to come 
farmers in miraflores say they try to keep growing coca because 
as poorly as the crop pays the alternatives are even worse 
under its national rehabilitation plan the government set up a 
program to buy corn and other crops from farmers in backward areas 
and has subsidized them by paying the high cost of air transport to 
markets hundreds of miles away 
but the high production cost of corn and other alternative crops 
in isolated areas limits farmers interest in the program 
some growers in miraflores said they will try to get by until 
the price of coca goes back up

a socialist and a probusiness 
advocate are squaring off in a presidential runoff election seen as 
brazils last chance to peacefully resolve deepseated social and 
economic problems 
some 82 million voters are eligible to choose on sunday between 
conservative fernando collor de mello and radical leftist luis 
inacio lula da silva in the second round of brazils first free 
presidential election since 1960 
the two led a 21candidate field in the first round nov 15 but 
neither obtained the majority required by law the winner will 
succeed president jose sarney for a fiveyear term starting march 
15 
both collor de mello and da silva are young charismatic leaders 
with broad support among brazils poor majority both started their 
political rise during the 19641985 rightwing military regime 
both are harsh critics of the sarney government which they accuse 
of being inept and corrupt 
but the two differ sharply on the solutions for brazils 
economic and social problems which include 1460 percent 
inflation widespread poverty and a 110 billion foreign debt the 
largest in the third world 
many see the election as a last chance for a peaceful resolution 
of brazils glaring social and economic inequalities the world 
bank says for example that brazils income distribution is the 
most unequal anywhere 
if the new government doesnt solve brazils problems it will 
face a crisis and collapse in economic and social chaos food 
shortages looting of supermarkets paralyzation of public 
services the middle class attacked by starving masses said 
political scientist helio jaguaribe everything indicates 
democracy will not survive 
the favorite is collor de mello 40 who founded his 
centerright national reconstruction party just 10 months ago 
the scion of a wealthy political clan in the tiny sugar 
canegrowing state of alagoas in the impoverished northeast collor 
de mello won tremendous popularity with promises to clean up 
corrupt government 
his wellcut suits aquiline good looks and stinging attacks on 
sarney captured the imagination of poor voters he also is backed 
by rightwing parties businessmen big landowners and the powerful 
globo tv network brazils largest 
his critics say collor de mellos record belies his posture as a 
moralizer they point out he was a member of the old military 
regimes political party and was accused of payroll padding and 
favoring the sugar barons while governor of alagoas 
collor de mello has an image as an antipolitician a man 
against the system jaguaribe said he hides his centerright 
tendency behind a moralist pose 
the 44yearold da silva popularly known as lula a nickname he 
had legalized is a congressman and former lathe operator who is 
the candidate of the radical left workers party 
a gradeschool dropout the stocky bearded da silva became 
nationally known in 1980 when he led a strike against brazils 
foreignowned auto industry he later was sentenced to 3 years in 
prison for breaking the national security law but wound up serving 
just 30 days as the ruling generals announced a plan for a gradual 
return of civilian liberties 
in 1986 both collor de mello and da silva moved toward national 
recognition in politics 
collor de mello switched to the opposition brazilian democratic 
movement party was elected governor of alagoas and made national 
headlines by firing socalled maharajas local civil servants 
making thousands of dollars a months mostly through political 
connections 
da silva was elected to congress in 1986 with more votes than 
any other candidate he is supported by leftist labor groups 
intellectuals and the dominant liberal wing of brazils roman 
catholic church 
the winner will take on the task of leading a country of 150 
million people with the western worlds eighthlargest economy but 
in which the richest 1 percent owns as much as the poorest 50 
percent and half the work force earns the equivalent of 20 a week 
or less 
both candidates say fighting inflation is the no 1 priority and 
promise to court foreign investment but they diverge sharply on 
other issues 
collor de mello proposes to cut spending and privatize many 
staterun companies he favors a conventional approach to the 110 
billion foreign debt but would limit repayments to 2 percent of the 
gross national product or about 5 billion a year about a third 
of what brazil now pays 
da silva promises higher wages curbs on profits and an 
immediate moratorium on foreign debt payments he is against the 
sale of state companies and spending cuts 
to raise salaries someone has to lose the gravelly voiced 
candidate said in a recent televised debate its impossible to 
fight inflation without suspending payment of the foreign debt 
the gap between the candidates has polarized the election into a 
battle of left vs right rich vs poor socialism vs free market 
brazil is in a state of war and in war you have to take 
sides i want to take the side of the poor whom lula represents 
bishop mauro morelli of duque de caxias an impoverished city near 
rio de janeiro said in an interview 
collor de mello has played on the elites fear of a da silva 
government he warned of a blood bath if the leftist wins 
lulas radical ideas mean strikes and chaos says one 
campaign advertisement for collor de mello foreign investment 
will leave brazil lula is a step backward for brazil 
mario amato president of the influential federation of 
industries of the state of sao paulo predicted that 800000 
businessmen will flee the country if da silva is elected 
da silvas campaign ads counter that collor de mello is a 
creation of the dictatorship and advise viewers dont put a 
fox in charge of the henhouse 
lula is virtually the only national leader who can say i am 
from the people i look like the people he has real 
credibility alfred stepan professor of political science and 
dean of the school of international and public affairs at columbia 
university in new york said in an interview in sao paulo where he 
attended a recent seminar 
while the campaign has stirred passions among voters 73 
percent of whom never cast a ballot for president the campaign 
has been remarkably peaceful 
for a country to come out of 21 years of military rule with 
the worst income distribution in the world and have the majority of 
the people committed to democratic change is extraordinary 
stepan said 
the last elected president was janio quadros in 1960 he 
abruptly resigned after seven months in office claiming an 
oligarchy sought to disrupt his presidency the ensuing 
confusion led to an armed forces coup in 1964 sarney a civilian 
was chosen in a 1985 electoral college vote coordinated by the 
military government

stuck on what to buy this christmas 
make it video 
whether you want to splurge spree invest or just stuff a few 
stockings here are some wonderful items to buy and some excellent 
excuses for buying them 
splurge 
a new television set with a 27inch screen 
if youre a typical american youve been watching that 19inch 
tube for more than a few years while new technology has been making 
it obsolete 
this is no time to wait for high definition tv the best 
estimates put hdtv at least five years away from the expensive end 
of the marketplace and maybe even longer before its affordable in 
the mass consumer market 
japanese manufacturers are designing video and audio circuitry 
that tweaks the tv signal for all its worth they make enhanced 
definition with much sharper pictures even if you live in an 
area where cable tv isnt available everywhere much of the 
broadcast soundtrack in major us cities is in hifi stereo so a 
tinny little speaker just isnt going to make it for the 1990s 
an inexpensive 19inch set costs about 200 in a discount 
house its about 400 for a 19inch tv loaded with the new 
technology and about 700 for a lowend hightech 27inch tube 
in areas where such electronic goods are heavily discounted you 
can shop around and get a stunning stereophonic cableready tv 
set for less than 1000 were talking automatic tuning inputs 
for multiple video sources outputs to your home stereo a 
smart remote control and a picture thatll knock your eyes out 
go for it

spree 
a combination laserdisc and compact disc player 
if you havent already taken the plunge into digital audio for 
your home stereo you should compact discs dont wear out and make 
any stereo system sound startlingly better the budgetminded 
approach is to buy a small portable unit to start then trade up to 
a fullfeatured model but if youve got some christmas money to 
throw around why not get into digital audio with a machine that 
also plays videos they cost around 500 in the discount houses 
but the laserdisc image is said to be 60 percent sharper than the 
best vhs player and the sound quality is just like a cd 
newly released laserdiscs are sometimes cheaper than vhs tapes 
a vhs new release that retails for 8995 is in the video disc rack 
for 4995 and some may sell for 2995 and in theory laserdiscs 
dont wear out and the digital signal will never become obsolete 
also there are certain features you cant get with a vcr such 
as letterbox formatting that allows you to see the wide screen 
image 
in the fullfeature laserdisc format the producers include 
incredibly comprehensive supplementary material the threedisc 
package for the 1936 classic musical showboat includes excerpts 
from the 1929 universal film version excerpts of ziegfields 1932 
broadway revival interviews with stars a color film documentary 
on showboats a visual essay of 300 stills tracing the history of 
showboats and the history of the musical on stage screen and 
radio and enough other archival material to choke a librarian

invest 
a vhs player 
not a recorder mind you but a transportable playonly machine 
that can run off a 12volt car boat or rv system and is about half 
the size and half the cost of a videocassette recorder 
its great to have a backup when your main vcr breaks down its 
great to have a portable vcr when youre on vacation or out of the 
country you have to look for these but theyre available at most 
video dealers and start at around 150 
a fourhead hifi super vhs videocassette recorder or at 
the very least a stereo vcr that you can pipe through your home 
audio system

stocking stuffers 
a nonabrasive vcr head cleaner use it only when you have 
significant deterioration in picture quality tape heads are 
delicate precision devices and should not be messed with 
blank tapes people never have enough blank tapes and they 
never buy themselves high quality tapes 
videocassette storage racks people never have enough places to 
store videocassettes which need and deserve a safe dustfree 
resting place 
a years worth of cable tv service surprisingly affordable 
gift certificates are available call your local cable company for 
details 
videocassettes most people are surprisingly reluctant to buy 
themselves their favorite movies and you usually know what your 
friends and relatives enjoy from teenage mutant ninja turtles 
to rock concert videos operas and great games of the world series 
even better the emergence of big retail video chains and the 
plethora of available programming has pushed down the price of 
video software 
suprisingly the monster hits of recent years are most heavily 
discounted batman the summer megahit is couponed rebated 
and generally knocked down to less than 20 who framed roger 
rabbit lists for about 20 et the extraterrestrial is 
about 25 the right stuff lists for around 30 and the newly 
restored version of lawrence of arabia is 40 
theres also an abundance of competitively priced 
christmasoriented programming in video stores at this time of the 
year from old favorites such as irving berlins holiday inn to 
cartoons that will hose down the kids late on christmas day 
laserdiscs any great film makes for a great disc and most are 
digitally remastered to take advantage of the technology blade 
runner is a big favorite so are gone with the wind cropped 
back down to its original format and its colors restored and the 
godfather but the hit pick for christmas giving has to be 
lawrence of arabia 
the 1962 academy awardwinning film was restored from its 
original negatives under the supervision of director david lean 
who added 20 minutes of footage cut from the original release the 
standard clv 4995 and the extended play 3 discs 12495 list 
contain copious supplementary material

some video donts 
dont buy for video collectors without very specific knowledge 
or instruction either theyll already have it theyll quibble at 
the quality of the recording or the format or theyll say they

buy them a can of compressed air for blowing dust out of their 
machines or a spray bottle of glass cleaner and nolint paper 
towels buy them a videocassette rewinder batterypowered 2995 
at radio shack or a bulk eraser to get rid of unwanted recordings 
dont forget to buy instant fireplace at 995 the

let love rule virgin lenny kravitz 
 
quick now the cover of lenny kravitzs let love rule album 
pictures a black man in dreadlocks with a ring through his nose 
what type of music does the cover protect 
your first guess was probably not a singersongwriter album that 
owes much to the 1970s work of such artists as paul mccartney and 
stevie wonder 
but confounding expectations is kravitzs game his debut album 
is encouraging in several respects first its nice to see an 
artist any artist break past stereotypes at a time when racial 
tension is high and too many people have closedminded views about 
whats black music or white music 
second its encouraging that any company in the conservative 
record business will allow a brand new artist to produce write and 
perform an album virtually by himself many established artists 
dont get the same trust 
of course the clear danger in these homemade projects is 
too much selfindulgence yes let love rule suffers from this 
but what it lacks in slickness it frequently makes up for in charm 
and intimacy 
with its overly polite workmanlike drumming let love rule 
sounds much like mccartneys first solo album kravitz also shows a 
fondness for the hippie era in his lyrics for such songs as i 
build this garden for us 
the soaring title track is one of this rookies best moments as 
is mr cab driver in the latter kravitz accompanies himself 
on fuzztone guitar while telling of a cab driver passing him up for 
a ride because of his dreads and skin color he ends with an 
expletive 
my precious love a gospel number with guest organist henry 
hirsch is another high point be sounds strikingly like 
plastic ono bandera john lennon 
be forewarned though let love rule begins to get ponderous 
toward the end with many arrangements crawling 
kravitz may not be the genius that this selfproduced effort 
seems to herald but simply dismissing him as mr lisa bonet his 
tvstar wife is a mistake hes got enough talent and strength of 
convictions to merit watching

for actor roger moore james bond is a closed 
chapter except for occasional snatches of bondian repartee 
the only time you dont want a tape recorder is under the 
bed he jokes to an interviewer on the set of bullseye his 
latest movie 
moore who took over from sean connery as agent 007 is 62 now 
and taking it easy he tried a musical and quit during rehearsals 
bullseye he says is an extension of our home life 
because it pairs him with an old friend michael caine his 
daughter also has a part 
he has an easy unpretentious manner and looks fit enough to do 
another bond movie or two but a view to a kill in 1985 was 
his seventh and last and there are no plans for him to play the 
role again before that he did eight years as the saint on 
television 
in bullseye he and caine play double roles as a pair of 
unsuccessful con men and as crooked atom scientists selling state 
secrets sally kirkland a 1987 academy award nominee for anna 
plays the girl they once shared deborah barrymore moores 
26yearold daughter plays an undercover cia agent 
the 15 million comedy caper directed by michael winner 
death wish a chorus of disapproval comes from menahem 
golans 21st century productions and is due for us release late 
next summer 
leslie bricusses script allows moore to show off a david 
nivenesque comic touch that was often lacking in the bond movies 
moore traces his friendship with the 56yearold caine to the 
1960s when he bumped into him on a london street 
id seen him on tv stopped him and told him i thought he had 
a future recalled moore adding teasingly it shows how wrong 
i was 
michael and shakira caine and roger and luisa moore have often 
stayed with each other in switzerland or los angeles their first 
children were born six weeks apart so the two wives shared 
their pregnancies moore said 
both actors are of humble london origins caine an east end 
cockney moore a policemans son but moore says their approach to 
work is different 
unlike the everbusy caine moore insists im very happy not 
working i dont need work to keep me happy 
if you really want to act you have to want to do it more than 
anything you have to be willing to put up with crap at all levels 
including the food you eat and sometimes the food you dont eat 
he said 
he surprised the entertainment world by taking a singing role in 
andrew lloyd webbers new musical aspects of love but he 
bowed out in march six weeks into rehearsal saying he couldnt 
sing the part 
its all right i suppose if youre 20 you jump in and you 
do it otherwise youre up there to be sniped at its very much a 
nowin situation 
he has one film awaiting release bed and breakfast with 
talia shire and colleen dewhurst and another comedy set to roll 
early next year 
he thinks acting is a tougher profession than when he started 
out more than 30 years ago 
there were more provincial theaters more repertory theaters 
more of a chance to learn acting said moore who spent three 
terms at londons royal academy of dramatic art before leaving to 
get practical experience in provincial repertory 
now youre thrown into the deep end you dont have time to 
learn no one has time to teach you anything 
he says he is neutral about his daughters decision to go into 
acting 
i didnt encourage her i didnt discourage her said moore 
who has two other children both sons theres a lot of heartache 
attached to it a lot of hard work 
deborah moore is a graduate of the london academy of music and 
dramatic art she changed her stage surname to barrymore because 
theres another deborah moore in british equity the actors union 
her father doesnt think his fame has advanced her career i 
think ive been a hindrance to her 
there are an awful lot of socialists out there who hate 
success who hate anything associated with success so they think 
im successful and they say oh well get somebody else 
you will note he added wryly that i am slightly right 
wing of attila 
nepotism moore says is not what it used to be 
he says people think deborahs related to drew barrymore the 
young star of et the extraterrestrial and adds with a laugh 
it makes it worse

thinking back on his career michael winner finds 
something very odd 
and that is he said that a very sophisticated british chap 
who lives in a stately home in london has made more films probably 
than most americans in the worst slums of america 
winner is a cambridge universityeducated sort of chap who puffs 
cigars and is best known for directing the death wish series of 
movies about vigilante warfare against the punks rapists and 
muggers of america 
now he has gone back to trying to make people laugh 
i sort of slipped into this bath of blood and made all those 
pictures and i decided i had to do something myself to get back 
winner said during a break on the set of bullseye his comedy 
caper starring roger moore and michael caine 
due for summer release and budgeted at 15 million bullseye 
pairs caine and moore for the first time onscreen playing dual 
roles as con men and atom scientists 
on one recent day winner was shooting at the west london 
location of syon house home since 1594 to the dukes of 
northumberland and substantially redesigned two centuries later by 
architect robert adam and master landscapegardener capability 
brown 
its a long way from winners urban nightmares starring charles 
bronson and the director acknowledged he was more in his element 
here 
im more at home as we talk here in a wonderful 18th century 
palazzo which is the sort of place i live in said winner who 
lives in a london mansion in the bayswater district with british 
actress jenny seagrove 
its quite nice to be back in a more sophisticated area 
winner makes no apologies for the violence that has often 
defined his films from the mechanic in 1972 to the three 
death wish movies 
i think they were good thrillers said winner whose films 
have been accused of irresponsibly encouraging viewers to take the 
law into their own hands 
i have many friends who are muggers in the bronx and harlem 
and east new york they are fascinating people underused people 
who have to make do when society rejects them i love the people 
there he said 
winner started out as a critic and journalist his early movies 
were comedies among them a caper film the jokers with oliver 
reed and michael crawford but his comedies on the whole have not 
done well critically or financially 
his 1975 won ton ton the dog who saved hollywood flopped 
despite a starry supporting cast including henny youngman joan 
blondell milton berle and edgar bergen 
he has just come out with a chorus of disapproval his film 
of alan ayckbourns acclaimed play to a lukewarm critical 
reception 
the bullseye casting coup was his idea based he says on 
having watched caine and moore at dinner parties and seeing how 
wonderfully they work together as a comedy act socially 
weve always said we must find something and it just 
happened merely by chance i found this script that needed a lot of 
work but was basically a wonderful piece for them so here we are 
winner said the stars offscreen rapport was evident on screen 
they will often carry on a scene with ad libs of their own 
he said theres a shorthand both during the shooting and during 
the lunch break and all the time

sculpture is risky business for french artist 
chantal cottet instead of chisels she sculpts with dynamite hand 
grenades and artillery shells 
cottet 39 is the inventor of blast art a term she created 
to describe the jagged hunks of twisted steel born from her 
carefully planned explosions 
her studio is located on her familys farm outside paris in the 
middle of corn and beet root fields stretching as far as the eye 
can see yet the explosions she sets off using between 11 and 33 
pounds of dynamite rattle windows in villages miles away 
the farm is dotted with sculpture of all shapes and sizes 
including a giant mushroom form made from an imploded gas canister 
and graceful flower pots sprouting stainless steel tulips from 
inside 
during a recent interview cottet demonstrated her art she used 
penthrite the same explosive that police say was used to bomb a 
passenger jet of the french airline uta last october over west 
africa 
the penthrite itself isnt dangerous things get risky the 
moment you connect the explosive to the detonator she said 
holding up the twoinch device if this goes off before im 
ready ill lose three fingers and an eye 
the most treacherous aspect of her work she explained comes 
from elements she cannot control such as the random electrical 
current generated by highspeed trains passing by just 164 feet 
from the woods where she does the blasting and which could in 
fact ignite the explosive before she is safely away 
preparations for the explosion took more than an hour cottet 
wrapped the plasticcoated penthrite cords in a spiral design 
around the insides of a cylindrical steel frame that supported a 
vacuumsealed aluminum can 
at one point the rusted frame tipped over with cottet inside 
and narrowly missed the water table in which the explosion was to 
take place 
once the can was secured inside the frame it was lowered into 
the vat cottet then wound up an electrical sparker that set off 
the blast 
three two one she yelled yanking the lever the loud 
blast sent a shower of water high into the air wetting onlookers 
steam rose from the churning water the frame was hoisted high 
in the air and there was cottets sculpture a dripping crumpled 
aluminum can filled with dirt balls 
but she is only halfpleased 
the hardest part of my work is trying to determine how the 
material is going to react given the amount of explosive used and 
how it is attached she said this isnt bad but i think ill 
explode it again to open up the top part 
the second explosion this time on the ground takes visitors 
watching from behind a shatterproof glass window by surprise as 
the can is propelled into the air behind a cloud of pungent smoke 
the carcass will become a finished work of art once it is washed 
and polished 
cottet has been working with explosives for seven years ever 
since the day she found an abandoned rusting gas canister a 
bunch of kids probably blew up for fun 
its hollow shape was what id been trying to achieve in marble 
and wood for a long time she said the moment i saw the can i 
knew id found my calling 
she has perfected her knowledge and use of explosives during 
frequent seminars at french military bases in the beginning she 
was the oddball artist today she is known to everyone and is 
taken seriously enough to receive grants from the culture and 
defense ministries 
besides penthrite and dynamite which she stores in special 
temperature and humiditycontrolled closets protected by 
sophisticated alarm systems cottet sculpts with hand grenades and 
artillery shells 
she finds out when the military base in bourges is planning to 
fire missiles and artillery shells and places her material in the 
right position so it will be blown up in the way she wants 
look at this piece of armored steel she said caressing the 
hundreds of jagged dents left by bullets isnt it beautiful 
not everyone agrees the artist has run into considerable 
opposition not only from art institutions such as the beaux art 
academy where she trained but also from private galleries 
collectors and even fellow artists 
people told me i was crazy when i began working with 
explosives they might look at the sculpture and say they like it 
but when they find out it was done with explosives they shy 
away she said 
but she dismissed the idea that her work is offputting because 
it bears the traces of violence and ultimately death to me the 
sculpture conveys notions of power and energy latent in the metal 
she likes being called a pioneer but is sorry she has no 
students to train 
im sure huge strides could be made in this field if there 
were more of us she said

ten years ago peter gabriel bought his first 
drum machine all he needed were rhythms to program 
bored with rock n roll the former star of genesis looked to 
africa asia the middle east and elsewhere 
he couldnt believe what he was hearing the freshest grooves 
the richest harmonies spirituals from pakistan african jazz from 
tabu ley of zaire cubas orquesta reve perfomers of son the 
root of modern salsa 
his music was never the same gabriel began experimenting with 
rhythms on his 1982 album security on one track rhythm of 
the heat he used a ghanian drum section and the same year 
helped form the womad world of music arts and dance festival 
gathering bands from more than 60 countries 
like the rolling stones who went out of their way to praise the 
blues musicians who influenced their records gabriel wanted to 
find a large audience for these exciting sounds 
grooves for me are physical things explained the 
39yearold gabriel in new york recently to promote the release of 
four records on the new realworld label they make me feel good 
a bad disco groove of which theres an awful lot doesnt make me 
want to dance 
some of the grooves we now take as commonplace rock have come 
from africa and latin america they travel across the seas and 
become slightly different i think quite often white artists dont 
quite get it right and we end up coming out with a form which is 
new 
the records just issued are passion sources music from the 
middle east and africa that gabriel heard while putting together 
the soundtrack for the last temptation of christ 
shahenshah by pakistans nusrat fateh ali khan one of the 
foremost singers of the devotional music called qawwali la 
explosion del memento by orquestra reve and tabu leys babeti 
soukous 
weve tried to look for performers who have a lot of soul 
gabriel said i think they have strong traditions in their own 
countries its sometime unfortunate that it gets all out under a 
world music label you talk to the musicians themselves and they 
say what the hell is this world music i play my music whatever 
it is 
gabriel is part world musician part traveling salesman he 
knows record buyers might never even look at the selections from 
the middle east or africa without an old friend pointing the way 
so if you happen to think of peter gabriel while listening to the 
infectious grooves of tabu ley well at least thats a start 
its not me im selling but someone else he said its 
saying to people who are interested in my music that if you like my 
stuff theres a chance you would like some of the things that 
really turn me on 
but its not peter gabriels label its a label in which i 
participate we have a rule where everyone on our committee has to 
like everything that goes out 
lyrics are not included forcing the listener to turn his or her 
attention away from the songs literal meaning and concentrate 
instead on the emotions of the performance in qawwali for 
instance words are chanted over and over to a simple rhythm 
giving them a hypnotic mantralike effect 
there are ways which you get into a framework where everything 
you hear is music which is probably a nice place to be he said 
you can really hear the emotion and humanity so many 
intrumentalists are desperately trying to speak with their 
instruments are trying to run the gamut of human emotions you 
try to listen to their soul and the feeling that comes out of it 
some of these wonderful singers from all around the world are just 
capable of getting the hairs up in the back of my neck thats what 
i look for 
gabriel of course has one advantage over the average listener 
hes actually met the people on the records not all the local 
musicians however were impressed by the presence of a world 
famous rock star 
half knew who i was half had no idea one of the qawwali 
groups assumed i was a guy who worked around the studio and didnt 
know i was a musician when they found out i could play they were 
a little bit curious 
for gabriel this music suits his political ideals as well 
regional tensions he discovered can crumble under the power of a 
universal language 
one of the best evenings he had was when he was improvising with 
a pakistani singer and sitar player ravi shankar whos from india 
shankar played double violin india and pakistan dont normally 
work together and probably wouldnt have in other situations but 
they really got turned on said gabriel 
i was contributing but in a subsidiary role now im going to 
do an album with the two of them they started out not hostile but 
suspicious of each other by the end of it they were in love all 
in the space of 40 minutes

mary gordon is an author and a fairly popular 
one too but her mother wished she had taken a more secure job 
such as stenography 
other family members agreed the author can still remember her 
cousin a nun remarking how much she disliked her books even her 
beloved uncle criticized her work calling it dirty its never 
stopped her though 
if gordon had never produced a single novel shed still write 
perhaps keep a journal or diary or make notes to herself if 
necessary she wouldnt feel well otherwise its how she best 
expresses herself 
growing up in an irish household uncomfortable with verbal 
communiation writing was the only way she could imagine life 
outside her unhappy family 
her novels final payments men and angels and the new 
the other side 1995 viking are printed confessions 
attempts at saying the unsayable penetrations of characters who 
conceal their emotions 
irish culture does not value emotional display the author 
said in a interview so it certainly doesnt value emotional 
articulateness it values stoicism it values silence and it values 
keeping things to yourself 
i know that inarticulate people have very rich inner lives 
they just dont have the language for it some people who are 
educated or uppermiddleclass assume that if you control language 
or own language that means you have a finer inner life but you 
can speak emotionally and not be revealing any true emotions 
the imminent death of ellen mcnamara in her 90s brings 
together four generations in the other side but this family 
seems only to share unhappiness infidelities casual cruelty and 
emotional instability have made the mcnamaras incapable of 
supporting each other even at this time 
i wouldnt know what to write about a good family gordon 
said they dont interest me as a writing problem what are you 
going to say they all got together somebody took the leg of the 
chicken somebody took the breast and somebody got the wing who 
cares 
but she cant resist a streak of creeping optimism theres 
hope from dan and camille two of the mcnamara grandchildren who 
seek love outside their unhappy marraiges and darci dans playful 
daughter 
i have a lot of faith in darci shes got juice and shes got 
pizzaz life is probably not going to be as wonderful and glorious 
as she thinks it is but shes got life shes got life force 
the author said 
i think what happens to you as a child a young child is 
tremendously important i think feeling approved of feeling loved 
feeling safe is something that cant be replaced if you dont 
have that i think youre really crippled its as if you had to 
learn to walk again as an adult 
gordons characters are weighted down by guilt a belief that 
all earthly pleasure is undeserved an exaggerated sense of duty 
in final payments a young woman shuts herself off from the 
outside world for years to nurse her sick father the housekeeper 
in men and angels takes it upon herself to save her boss 
from the sins of humanity 
obligation drives vincent mcnamara ellens husband to leave 
the nursing home where he had finally found happiness to fulfill a 
longforgotten promise to be at his wifes side when she dies 
the question of what do you owe people and what you allow for 
yourself is very vexing and i think the irish are very 
idealistic gordon said they love the possibility of martyrdom 
looming somewhere in the future 
they love the idea of a heroic goal that you can devote your 
life to i think its shaped their political life and its shaped 
their literature 
gordon a native of long island wrote poetry until age 25 and 
then started on final payments which came out in 1978 she 
takes her characters through sickness and health faith and 
despair sex and religion vulnerability the dependance on 
uncontrollable forces fascinates gordon and terrorizes her as 
well 
the uncomplicated joy of darci is shadowed by ellen a once 
formidable woman reduced to desperate howls of pain 
one of the terrible things about aging is the way that you 
lived does not matter nearly so much as the way youre going to 
die she said you can live a really rich noble life and die 
like a jibbering animal you can live like a total jerk and have a 
nothing life but have a rather beautiful peaceful death 
words beaten into sound thats what happens to ellen as she 
nears death gordons characters struggle between language and 
emotion and for most of their lives language wins but in the 
end emotion resurfaces as a writer gordon tries to weave them 
together 
the rhythm of words and the physical existence of words is 
very important to me i write very physically to get the intensity 
of emotional experience into intensely connected language is a 
very very big goal 
i think theres always a problem with language what does 
langauge actually reveal the distance between what we want to say 
and what we are able to say is tragically great

you start with the name the kentucky 
headhunters 
images of barefoot spearcarrying ruffians in loincloth 
it makes people think were wild naked hillbillies says 
richard young a member of the fivemember band from glasgow ky 
whose music is as intriguing as their name the five are a newly 
signed recording group who play country rock n roll bluegrass 
blues and jazz 
we offer a blend of merle haggard bill monroe and led 
zeppelin says doug phelps whose brother ricky lee also plays 
in the group 
basically what were doing is taking bluegrass music and 
making it jazzy young says john lennon has done it and all 
those people over there they would take a bluegrass song and make 
it uptempo 
now about the name 
the group nicknamed the heads took the name from a music 
term believed to have originated from the blues great muddy waters 
the term headhunters apparently came about when waters band 
displaced local less proficient groups as waters band toured the 
country 
the proud kentuckians added their state to the term and their 
memorable name was born 
this is the first thing that catches everybodys attention 
ricky lee phelps says 
says young i called one guy at a radio station and he said he 
opened our record just because of the name he said it sounded like 
something out of national geographic 
adds group member greg martin with a chuckle weve got 
everybody scared to death they think headhunters 
the group whose members are in their late 20s to mid30s has 
been together four years their first mercurypolygram album is 
pickin on nashville and the first single released from the lp 
is walk softly on this heart of mine 
the band consists of four guitars and drums and occasionally an 
harmonica 
its aggressive music but its a bunch of hillbillies playing 
it ricky lee phelps says 
drummer fred young richards brother says we all grew up 
using the outhouse 
weve all run out of toilet paper out there richard adds 
the band plays a mixture of music ranging from jimi hendrixs 
wait til tomorrow to creams crossroads and country 
standards such as oh lonesome me and wildwood flower they 
close their performances by saluting their home state with my old 
kentucky home 
ricky lee phelps adds an entertaining touch to their 
performances by pulling an array of props out of a trunk on stage 
its full of toys he says ive got water guns in there 
and i wet people down i pull out a phone and talk to elvis ive 
got some magic tricks and i throw out cheap novelties to the 
crowd 
he also juggles bowling pins four is the most i can do and 
three is plenty 
fred young often plays drums shirtless borrowing the idea from 
other drummers hes seen it also saves time when hes through 
playing 
ive been playing this way all my life it gets hot back there 
and you dont want to jump in the shower afterwards with your 
clothes on 
their instruments are as unpretentious as the musicians playing 
them theyve disdained stateoftheart guitars and drums for 
instruments that are 20 years old and older 
these drums are a complete different sound fred young says 
about his set which has metcalfe county high school proudly 
printed on them i dont ever remember tuning them 
before the phelps brothers joined the group the band was known 
as itchy brothers this name was borrowed from the king leonardo 
cartoon show in which itchy was king leonardos evil brother 
it was a good name richard young says we thought about 
keeping it the kentucky headhunters are an extension of it

a bookkeeping issue that seemingly only an 
accountant could love is commanding keen interest on capitol hill 
the debate on how to tally the budget deficit could have big 
implications for social security 
the deficit by law is defined as the difference between federal 
income and spending including the billions earned and spent for 
social security benefits so as the social security trust funds 
build big reserves to help pay for baby boomers retirement in the 
next century the official deficit tally is held down by payroll 
and employer taxes earmarked for social security benefits 
democrats and republicans both are increasingly supporting 
taking social securitys moneymaking trust funds out of the 
deficit equation claiming that the current system masks the extent 
of the rest of the governments red ink 
in fiscal 1988 for example the governments 155 billion 
deficit would have been 194 billion if social security were 
excluded in 1989 the official deficit fell to 152 billion 
without social security it was 2045 billion 
we are playing a game with the way we report the budget 
deficit each year sen john heinz told colleagues in october 
it seems to me it is time to fess up to what we are doing and do 
something about it 
heinz rpa held up action on an urgent debt bill until 
congressional leaders agreed to tackle the deficitdefinition issue 
early next year 
those who favor removing social security from the equation say 
the unrealistically rosy budget picture removes pressure to cut the 
deficit and that the move would help protect the trust fund 
reserves 
what were trying to do is stop the looting of that trust 
fund and get truth in budgeting said sen ernest hollings 
dsc 
if we can save our social security trust fund surpluses 
rather than spending them on government consumption as we do 
presently we can more than double our net national savings rate 
said sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
critics maintain that removing social security from the equation 
would excuse a big chunk of the budget about 20 percent of 
federal spending from making more contributions toward reducing 
the deficit they also say that once trust funds no longer are 
counted politicians might spend the reserves on pet projects or 
bigger benefits for todays retirees at the expense of tomorrows 
every day i and other members of the ways and means committee 
answer mail asking for benefit expansions by stating that we cannot 
further improve benefits because of the budget deficit rep dan 
rostenkowski dill told a house panel recently this argument 
will be eliminated when social security becomes completely 
offbudget 
robert d reischauer director of the congressional budget 
office shares that concern it certainly would be harder to fend 
off proposals to raise benefits or cut payroll taxes without the 
discipline of deficit reduction reischauer told lawmakers 
for example he said congress might have been unable to resist 
recent efforts to boost payments to notch babies americans 
born in 1917 through 1921 who get lower benefits due to a change 
in the method of calculation 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king calls the 
deficitdefinition debate one of the most specious discussions 
youre ever going to find in government since it shifts numbers 
on paper without altering spending 
yet she is wary of tinkering with the system i have a real 
concern if taking it offbudget means making it more vulnerable to 
pull it out there have got to be some safeguards built around that 
trust fund to ensure that nobody can raid it 
rostenkowski believes social security is better off left as it 
is but he has introduced legislation to help protect the trust 
funds if they are removed from the deficit calculations under the 
bill a house member could object to any legislation that increased 
social security benefits without providing for a corresponding 
increase in revenues such an objection could be overruled only by 
a majority vote in the house rules committee or by 60 votes in the 
senate 
without such protections rostenkowski said congress may not 
have the political courage to say no to those proposals which 
would increase benefits immediately but at the same time further 
jeopardize our childrens benefits 
mrs king called rostenkowskis bill a step in the right 
direction but said it wasnt strong enough to adequately protect 
the trust funds 
accompanying the deficitdefinition debate is the broader 
question of whether social security should continue stockpiling 
money now to meet the big retirement demands of the baby boom 
generation 
the general accounting office early in 1989 said congress should 
consider rolling back payroll tax increases because the social 
security reserves are being used to finance the current 
operations of the government and are masking the size of the 
onbudget deficit 
returning social security to a payasyougo system would 
involve reducing payroll taxes in the 1990s and raising them above 
scheduled levels in the next century when benefit costs will rise 
as the baby boomers retire 
this would eliminate the illusory buildup of reserves that now 
represents little more than a mechanism for using the payroll tax 
to finance the general operations of government the gao said

youth might be wasted on the young but education isnt 
inspired by the youth hosteling movement in europe a 
bostonbased studytravel program called elderhostel is booming it 
offers a nearly overwhelming range of inexpensive courses for 
seniors at sites around the world 
it gives me a chance to meet a bunch of people who ive never 
met before who all have great things to contribute said don 
stangel 71 of rockport mass who has attended elderhostel 
programs since 1977 it gives me a terrific break from my normal 
routine i wouldnt be without it 
we thoroughly enjoy it said paul robb 82 of muncie ind 
who with his wife catherine has attended nine elderhostel 
courses both in the united states and abroad theyve signed up 
for two more courses in 1990 
seniors can study marine life in polynesia culture in japan 
genealogy in london the byzantine civilization in turkey or other 
topics at more than 100 overseas locations or history dance 
theater literature biology ecology sports and other subjects at 
more than 1200 sites in the united states and canada courses are 
offered in all 50 states and all canadian provinces 
in fact the range of programs can be daunting the latest 
catalog is 144 pages with a 40page supplement and reads like a 
good novel 
its a mistake to think of older adults as one market said 
mike zoob vice president of elderhostel we deliberately have an 
enormous variety of programs some are more rugged like hiking in 
the himalayas id like that but its not everyones cup of tea 
a lot of people go where their children or grandchildren are 
or plan a vacation and pop in an elderhostel program along the 
way said spokeswoman karyn franzen 
elderhostel began in 1975 with 220 seniors taking courses at 
five colleges and universities in new hampshire its popularity has 
soared since in 1989 197000 people took part at more than 1400 
locations in 42 countries 
us and canadian courses often begin on a sunday afternoon and 
end the following saturday morning while overseas programs run two 
to three weeks 
some people go elderhosteling across the country taking five 
six seven even thirteen courses in a row zoob said 
prices for domestic programs range from 230 to 275 per person 
slightly more in canada and hawaii double in alaska that includes 
six nights lodging five days of courses all meals and a variety 
of extracurricular activities 
elderhostel also sponsors some hostelships financial 
assistance which enables the very poor to attend nearby programs 
programs are limited to those 60 and older but seniors can be 
accompanied by someone as young as 50 
accommodations are spartan often consisting of two twin beds in 
a college dormitory with bathrooms down the hall single rooms are 
sometimes available for an extra charge 
the elderhostel courses are not for credit have no grades or 
exams and except for intensive courses no homework the courses 
are designed to be accessible to everyone regardless of previous 
education 
just do it dont let anything stop you stangel said 
you dont have to have a college education even though most of 
the programs are held at colleges its the experiences in your 
life that make you interesting 
weather sometimes affects programs much as it does other travel 
plans but participants give elderhostel high marks for ingenuity 
it poured rain all week and we were supposed to be hiking 
through the woods said joanne bentley 61 of upper nyack ny 
who attended a program in the catskill mountains but they were 
very imaginative they brought in experts on acid rain and birds 
and whales 
they really coped awfully well on the spur of the moment 
other elderhostel travelers had the chance to see history being 
made on their latest trip to china 
marjorie edwards of la crascenta calif spent the evening of 
june 3 in tienanmen square in beijing it was a fascinating but 
very sad experience for us to see the marvelous progress china has 
made in the past nine years and then in one night see a turn of 
events that could spell disaster for continuing progress she 
wrote to elderhostel 
despite a rapid change in travel plans as elderhostel students 
returned home early some were still enthusiastic about the chinese 
trip 
i would like to encourage you to keep this program going 
wrote michael bresser of sun city ariz at no time did we feel 
threatened we were always surrounded by concern for our wellbeing 
the chinese are a great people and im convinced that we need 
to learn from them as much as they need to learn from us

the only thing wrong with retirement 
gerald giles says is he cant get a day off 
giles 68 of west des moines retired as a chemical engineer 
seven years ago as a volunteer for the service corps of retired 
executives he spends 10 hours a week advising small businesses on 
marketing and sales techniques he also is a speaker for gideons 
international which distributes bibles 
wes kitchell who retired as an insurance consultant in 1981 
coordinates monthly business seminars for score he has been a 
trustee for the masons for three years and visits once a week with 
patients at mercy hospitals heritage program for seniors 
some people think im driven but i just get a big kick out of 
life said kitchell 74 of des moines 
kitchell and giles may be getting more than just a kick out of 
life 
we think differently as we get older in a slower manner and 
there is some memory loss which is a perfectly normal finding 
said dr robert bender of the mercy hospital geriatric clinic 
but there is some evidence that staying mentally active may 
actually help preserve brain function 
mental lethargy and its effects on good health can be seen most 
easily in nursing home patients said dr roy overton another 
gerontologist at mercy 
in nursing home patients we see these pseudo dementias that 
arent real dementias at all you walk into a room and see a 
patient staring at the ceiling or the floor and you think theyve 
lost their minds but they havent theyre truly depressed said 
overton 
bender tells his patients to write down their talents and use 
them using ones talents is the epitome of mental activity which 
may prevent or slow down the changes in the aging brain 
albert einstein did active research until the week before he 
died in his 70s that shows you that we always have the capacity to

ah the stories they can tell about a 
man obsessed with the education of his children or a love story 
with venice as a backdrop or building a homestead in the early 
1900s 
a lot of us do memory pieces and if theyre not entirely 
memory we might write fiction based on things weve known said 
writer garnet garoni 71 of las cruces there isnt a very big 
market for that type of story but its really fun to write 
not a big market maybe but mrs garoni and other older new 
mexicans have found an outlet in serape an annual anthology of 
poetry and short stories by senior citizens published by nightjar 
press at new mexico state university serape first appeared on new 
mexico bookshelves in 1983 the result of a creative writing class 
at a las cruces senior center 
kevin mcilvoy an associate professor of english at new mexico 
state isnt proud that he was surprised at the caliber of writing 
he found among students at munson senior citizens center but his 
thinking took a quick sharp turn 
i thought gee this is powerful writing says mcilvoy 
who still teaches the weekly class its so strong so powerful 
and so informed by those years of experience that i really wanted 
it to be brought to readers 
serapes early issues contained work by class members but more 
recent editions have been open to older writers throughout the 
state some 30 pieces of work by 15 authors all of them 55 or 
older appear in the sixth edition of serape scheduled for 
release this month 
it will be the fourth time mrs garonis work has been published 
in serape miracles do happen a short fictional story 
about a girl who leaves a wisconsin town for the bright lights of 
chicago 
really one of my own thoughts about serape is what were doing 
is giving exposure to people whose names are not already 
recognizable but who are certainly doing important work mcilvoy 
said 
he and editors kathryn byrd and bill pearson retirees whose 
work has appeared in serape waded through 64 manuscripts of about 
25 pages each before making the wrenching final selections for the 
1989 edition 
we get quite a massive pile of material mcilvoy said the 
pile could become even more massive if he is able to expand the 
anthology to include older writers from throughout the southwest 
mcilvoy proposed the idea to new mexico state officials while also 
telling them the expansion would require higher production 
standards and more pages and therefore more funding 
serape which sells for 6 and can be purchased at bookstores 
around the state or from new mexico state now is funded mainly 
through sales and by the university with 10 percent coming from 
donors and patrons 
teaching at the munson center as i have done for the last six 
years and editing this anthology are for me the most important 
stimulating things that i do mcilvoy said i work with 
extremely talented young writers here at the university but the 
old cliche applies theres no replacing experience

karsten solheim millionaire engineer and golf 
club designer can trace his business philosophy to the years 
during the depression when he ran a shoe repair shop because he 
couldnt afford to stay in college 
when one of his two competitors on a seattle street corner 
reduced the price of heels to 15 cents solheim followed suit 
the first customer that came in asked me is that as good as 
it used to be of course i had to say yes when the next two 
customers asked the same question i decided most people were more 
interested in quality than price i took my sign down and resumed 
charging 35 cents for heels 
that observation was reinforced when he noticed that people 
would generally choose from the most expensive pile of leather on 
the counter 
again i found most people were more interested in quality than 
in price thats stuck with me all my life said solheim 77 
indeed golfers are willing to pay about onethird more for his 
ping customfitted putters and irons ping was the sound the 
first putters made they were used by more than 200 pros in 1989 
and netted 80 million in sales 
some of solheims other lessons came from his father a 
shoemaker who immigrated with his family from norway from him 
solheim learned hard work and a skill i wouldnt have had 
otherwise how to use my hands 
so when i came to making my clubs it was second nature 
it also was the way he made ends meet before the approach of 
world war ii enabled him to return to the university of washington 
by 1945 he was a flight research engineer by 1951 a project 
engineer on the atlas missile and by 1953 he began a long 
association with general electric as an engineer 
it was around then he decided he could afford to take up golf 
he was terrible at first he blamed himself but golf would never 
be the same after he concluded that the clubs were the problem and 
set out to design better ones 
the earliest ping putters were good for a laugh because the 
looked like a hot dog on the end of a stick the design concept 
came from tennis rackets which have the weight on the rim while 
the strings give the power 
a putter based on that theory would let a golfer miss a little 
and still hit straight solheim concluded i made them ugly on 
purpose so theyd be accepted for their worth not appearance 
he improved his game until he carried a five handicap 
something most golfers would like its now 18 but an eye problem 
keeps him off the links 
when he was starting he used to sit around the practice green 
with a bunch of putters hoping some of the pros would try them 
said bob goalby the 1968 masters champion one day he had holes 
in his shoes and somebody asked me whos that guy over there 
with those weird putters and holes in his shoes whats he doing 
here did you every see anything worse than that 
but he never became discouraged or angry hed listen to what 
guys would say after trying his putters take their criticism to 
heart go back and change them come back the next day or next 
tournament and say what do you think of this one now and guys 
started saying hey karsten let me try that one but he sure 
took some heat at first 
from building clubs in his garage solheims privately held 
karsten manufacturing co has grown to employ 1700 people in 22 
buildings covering several blocks he received an e award 
during the reagan administration for increasing trade with foreign 
companies tiny flags of 77 countries where ping clubs are sold 
are displayed in the headquarters lobby 
in the early days solheim would test the wind drag of a clubs 
swing by holding various models out the window of his car while 
traveling at high speed now he has a sophisticated machine to 
measure drag and other equipment is so stateoftheart that plant 
tours are limited and security tight 
i think karsten is a genius as far as making golf clubs and 
equipment said quinton gray who has used pings since 1967 when 
the factory was making a new set for him in april he was given a 
tour 
the quality control is the best ive ever seen but what 
impressed me more than anything was you could go anywhere in the 
facility and you could sit down on the floor and have your lunch 
it was that clean and all the employees seemed happy everyone was 
very very friendly and accommodating gray said 
life is teaching solheim a new lesson however 
after more than a million sets of ping eye2 irons were sold the 
us golf association has banned them in the 13 usga championships 
starting jan 1 and in practically all play beginning in 1996 the 
professional golfers association is also questioning the clubs but 
is banning all similar clubs not just pings 
the organizations say the shape of the grooves square or 
ushaped instead of a v and their spacing give stronger 
golfers an unfair advantage in backspin giving better control to 
stop a ball from rolling for example 
solheim in august filed a federal lawsuit against the usga and 
others alleging slander and violation of antitrust laws and 
seeking an injunction and damages in excess of 100 million 
itd be easy enough for me to change the clubs but i have to 
think of all those people whove bought them it wouldnt be fair 
to my customers and i dont want to destroy the performance of the 
clubs either he said what the usga is asking for and what the 
rules say are not the same 
the irony is there is a greater difference between dimples on 
balls than there is between the clubs thats where the big 
difference is but they dont have to change anything where in the 
world will you go and find somebody who wants something thats 95 
percent good when they can have it 100 percent 
how could i run a business with that kind of ambition

if jaguars and diamonds are a little pricey and 
storebought baubles arent personal enough for those on your list 
gifts fresh from your kitchen in attractive reusable containers 
make doubly delightful presents 
the time thoughtfulness and care that go into something 
handmade touch us all and part of the pleasure is looking for 
reusable containers ive found them in all sorts of places 
importexport stores have pottery glass baskets from all over 
the world a thrift or antique shop may unearth a charming tray or 
vintage mason jars and local artisans offer oneofakind pieces 
for the kitchen and home that will be treasured for years 
anything will be happily received from a cut glass cruet for 
your homemade vinegar to a tiny tiered jewelry box with each 
drawer filled with tantalizing twobite confections 
when it comes time to stir things up in the kitchen be sure to 
include your grandchildren or any small children for that matter 
the sights sounds and smells enliven the creative spirit and 
simple tasks such as helping stuff dates and rolling out cookies 
are just the ticket they can have the fun of making a present for 
a teacher or treats for stockingstuffers 
following are some suggestions for your christmas or hannukkah

i count three tools as indispensable in 
my garden the spading fork the trowel and the pen 
true my pen has got an advanced degree now and dresses up as a 
computer wooing me with fancy tricks but basically it does the 
same work 
sure you can garden without records but many of us come to 
rely on and enjoy the daybyday jottings that chart our successes 
and failures over years 
on a spring day in virginia in 1766 22yearold thomas 
jefferson scribbled march 30 purple hyacinth begins to bloom 
thus began a notebook he found time for even during his presidency 
a farmer as well as a gardener jefferson was a painstaking 
notekeeper for eight years he tabulated the earliest and latest 
appearance of 37 vegetables on the washington market 
most importantly a notebook profiles the individual garden 
establishing the right times and places to plant things and 
reminding you when to dust or fertilize your plot differs from 
your neighbors in soil moisture slant of sun hours of shade 
you may get a killing frost while a garden 50 yards down the road 
escapes you cant steer only by directions on seed packets or in 
manuals theyre too generalized 
by keeping careful notes i learned the best time to plant 
brussels sprouts conventionally in my area 50 miles north of 
manhattan youre advised to plant in late july but my plants 
didnt make enough growth then the middle of june turned out best 
giving me nice sprouts in time to benefit from the hard october 
frosts that vastly improve their taste 
then some plant varieties do well in your garden and others 
dont you may be better off staying with your triedandtrue 
plants rather than going for the newest hybrids with dozens of 
varieties to track your notebook keeps a much better record of 
trials and errors than you could hope to in your memory 
notes or sketches also will remind you where you put what 
when some plants like the cabbage family need to be moved around 
from year to year to prevent disease 
many things go into a gardening diary little mystery stories 
may unfold looking at my 1983 notes i see my asparagus tips 
suddenly developed a chewed look slug bait did nothing at all nor 
was it a strange disease the culprit i caught him at it turned 
out to be a woodchuck that got over the fence 
on oct 4 1987 we had the earliest snowfall in my memory 
interesting for my diary because my beans and other tender crops 
survived 
my word processor has tidied up my recordkeeping immensely the 
insert and delete enable me to correct rewrite and edit as 
i go along at the end of the year i give the diary a touchup 
print it and bind it in a notebook 
if youre a computer buff you can move up to database 
recordkeeping letting you look at your garden from numerous 
perspectives creating a database is painstaking work and it takes 
a while to accumulate a significant amount of data but eventually 
you can ask your computer for example what flowers you have grown 
that bloom in the shade what kind of soil they like and when to 
plant them or how many european lettuces youve grown over the 
years push a couple keys and the computer will respond with names 
dates country of origin and anything else you wanted to record 
about the lettuce and it will do it in various formats giving 
you say only french lettuces or slowbolting ones 
big deal you might say but you get your answers instantly and 
its fun to do and its up to you to create the variety and 
penetration of searches 
if you have a computer but lack the time or patience to build 
your own database you can get readymade gardening programs that 
combine notekeeping with instruction and graphics you can file 
away sketches of your garden as it looked from year to year thus 
helping you to rotate your crops your zip code tells the program 
what plants are feasible for your area 
for the noncomputer minded there are special notebooks for the 
garden 
whether you work with pen or computer keeping notes like 
digging in the dirt is hard but brings special rewards

a new board game built around reallife 
situations from nursing and retirement homes around the country is 
designed to help people who work with the elderly solve problems 
and be more understanding 
the game of aging concerns asks participants to discuss how they 
would deal with challenges and crises that come up in homes for the 
elderly 
for example one game card instructs players to roleplay a 
situation in which an administrator is talking with a group of 
residents who are demanding the ouster of an unmarried man and 
woman who live together 
another card asks the player to discuss how to help an elderly 
man whose wife died two years earlier and feels he has nothing left 
to live for a third asks what to do about a 72yearold man who is 
intoxicated when he comes to the dining room and acts belligerant 
and disruptive 
the game was developed for the american association of homes for 
the aging by vicki schmall a gerontologist at oregon state 
university who based the game cards on more than 1000 situations 
submitted by retirement housing officials 
the aaha decided to produce the game after test groups reported 
that it helped stimulate discussions about challenges that arise in 
retirement homes said spokeswoman deborah cloud this is kind of 
a fun departure from the typical lecture and booklearning 
training 
schmall also has developed board games called sex and aging and 
families and aging to help people understand issues related to the 
elderly its a technique that works well in terms of 
problemsolving and helping people to step into the shoes of older 
adults it really encourages interaction and getting people to look 
at situations from a variety of perspectives 
the game is available for 30 plus 3 per game for shipping and 
handling from aaha publications american association of homes for 
the aging 1129 20th st nw suite 400 washington dc 200363489

more than onefourth of older americans cut 
back on basic necessities such as food energy or medical care 
because of money problems according to a government survey of 
married couples age 55 and older 
energy consumption including heat and hot water was the most 
frequent cutback followed closely by food with medical care 
reduced by substantially fewer households said the report in the 
agriculture department family economic review it said 145 percent 
of households surveyed reduced on one of the three necessities 69 
percent cut back on two and 52 percent cut back all three 
health or safety problems are likely to be a very real 
possibility for some households who cut back on food purchases 
heat or hot water or medical care the report said 
it also found that 31 percent of older households cut back on 
entertainment because of financial strains suggesting that when 
older consumers are faced with the need to cut back discretionary 
areas are likely to be cut first 
the report was based on an analysis of 2480 married couples 
included in the 1983 survey of aging veterans by the veterans 
administration since then shelter energy and medical care have 
been significant sources of inflation 
the difficulties that the older consumers were experiencing in 
1983 and which led to cuts by a substantial proportion of 
households in one or more basic consumption areas likely have 
persisted over time it said 
in addition marriedcouple households generally are better off 
economically than older consumers in general

a proposed deal that would give a soviet 
research institute an equity stake in a us biotechnology company 
could lead to the commercialization of soviet scientific advances 
experts said 
it comes in the context of a new soviet policy to integrate 
with the world economy so it could be the beginning of a trend 
said paul surovell editor of a newsletter that monitors soviet 
trade he noted that american companies already are taking equity 
in soviet companies 
under the plan the institute of protein research outside moscow 
will swap protein synthesis technology for a 5 percent to 20 
percent ownership stake in transgene inc a silicon valley 
startup specializing in protein synthesis 
the plan still needs approval by the us and soviet governments 
the soviets have developed a new way to create proteins like 
insulin that cut the development time from weeks to days or even 
hours 
kenneth lee national director of the biotechnology practice for 
the accounting firm ernst amp young said the deal would be the first 
of its kind 
we have found a way to collaborate without any cash he said 
pietro vainio a venture capitalist who helped negotiate for 
transgene said he hoped the deal would form one model for how 
us venture companies can invest in and commercialize promising 
new technology in the soviet union 
if the deal is approved transgene will be allowed to 
commercialize the technology and sell it to all but eastern 
european countries the technology would be transferred back to the 
soviet institute for sale in those countries 
the us commerce department and the treasury department are 
expected to become involved in the approval process because the 
joint venture would involve a transfer of technology in both 
directions

the dollar edged up against the japanese yen for 
the seventh consecutive trading day today and prices on the tokyo 
stock exchange also rose slightly 
the dollar closed at 14465 up 038 yen from its 14427 yen 
close on friday it opened at 14450 yen and ranged between 14445 
yen and 14473 yen the us currency now has climbed 175 yen in 
seven trading days 
its higher opening resulted from its surge last week in new 
york where it closed at 14425 on friday and from tightened 
demand for a large number of export contracts usually due for 
settlement on mondays dealers said 
but the bank of japan was believed to have stepped into the 
market several times selling dollars to keep the us currency 
within a narrow range said kaneo ogino of goldman sachs in tokyo 
the central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities 
ogino said market activity was likely to trail off toward the 
end of the month with dealers unwilling to take large positions 
before the new year 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues gained 2861 points or 008 percent closing at 
3775267 on friday the nikkei fell 13405 points after closing 
at record highs on 11 of the preceding 12 trading days 
trading started slowly today as investors waited to see the 
markets performance after its strong advances last week traders 
said 
after opening lower the nikkei rebounded toward the end of the 
morning session on renewed buying of resourcerelated and 
incentivebacked issues dealers said 
the large amount of funds flowing into the market from 
institutional and corporate investors prevented a major decline 
from profittaking they said 
investors are watching currency markets carefully out of concern 
that a renewed surge of the dollar against the yen could provoke an 
interest rate hike said julian jones of wi carrs equity sales 
volume was estimated at 700 million shares down from an 
estimated 1 billion shares friday

sparky may be the trendy new house pet 
of the 90s 
he wont bite the mailman or howl at the moon hes bigger than 
a cat but smaller than a doberman 
he doesnt shed smell or claw the furniture and prefers a tidy 
litterbox to the living room rug hell walk on a leash swim 
fetch or just sit and watch tv 
and the worst thing you can say about him well hes a pig a 
vietnamese potbellied pig 
these pygmy porkers have become popular pets in the last couple 
of years despite hefty prices ranging from about 1500 for a 
neutered male to 35000 for a pregnant female 
pig owners boast their pets learn quickly and have sunny 
dispositions they dont get really big fullgrown they weigh 
between 20 and 150 pounds as compared to hogs which can weigh 
half a ton but right now just about the only way to acquire a 
vietnamese potbelly is to get plugged into the nationwide breeders 
network 
thats where sparkys owner kris bryant comes in 
bryant breeds and sells vietnamese potbellied pigs through her 
company paradise pigs and keeps her customers updated on pig care 
and feeding through a homey newsletter 
from a recent issue it has been brought to my attention that 
some of you are unsure of how much to feed your piggies and some 
are even letting them pig out pun intended 
bryant is also about to launch pet pig update which she bills 
as the first magazine devoted to miniature pet pigs and she 
was recently elected to the board of the newly formed north 
american potbellied pig association with headquarters in columbia 
mo 
as one of a handful of vietnamese potbellied pig breeders 
bryant is particularly concerned about keeping the animals 
bloodlines pure while not inbreeding them virtually all the 
vietnamese potbellies in the united states are descended from a 
group of 18 brought in through canada in 1983 by keith connell 
there are several pig registries nationwide which certify how 
closely related the animals are to the original group but bryant 
says some breeders anxious to cash in on the growing market 
cross their vietnamese potbellies with other strains the resulting 
pigs are not as small or goodtempered or healthy as the real 
thing she says 
bryant got interested in the pintsized pigs by accident she 
had been trying to get a skunk to keep her cat company and applied 
for several exotic animal permits 
once i got all the permits i was on mailing lists and i 
started getting ads for zebras and giraffes and things she said 
in a recent interview i just was watching the pigs in those 
trade magazines and i really liked the idea because well pigs 
just make really great pets but theyre also a pet that anybody can 
have most of the pets that are unusual you cant have unless you 
have a farm the pigs you can have in an apartment 
bryant speaks from experience until recently she had been 
breeding pigs in a twobedroom condo in suburban rockville and at 
one point had 23 of them but she and her husband jeb are moving 
to durango colo where they will raise pigs and other exotic 
animals on a farm their breeding pigs are already there 
in the meantime the bryants and sparky are sharing quarters 
with a ferret a tabby cat a tank of goldfish in the house and 
oddly a bathtub filled with more fish outside on the balcony 
during a visit 4monthold sparky trundled around the living 
room and grunted softly before hopping on the couch to snuggle up 
he weighs about 15 pounds and feels like a bristly wiggly football 
with a warm rubbery snout 
bryant cant say enough good about her pigs but she confessed 
they have two weaknesses food and telephones 
pigs will overeat so bryant recommends a strict diet of mini 
pig chow they also like treats like peanuts raisins and fruits 
as for the telephone bryant said they like to knock it off 
the hook and push the buttons its cute but its annoying 
bryant has a us department of agriculture permit to breed the 
pigs but she said no special permission was needed in montgomery 
county to keep them as pets however some localities classify all 
pigs as livestock so its important for wouldbe owners to make 
sure they can keep pigs as pets

a tentative decision by the environmental 
protection agency to ban the ebdc pesticides widely used on many 
important food crops may erupt as a major 1990 agricultural issue 
on capitol hill 
the agency proposed a week ago to halt the use of ebdcs on 45 
food products including tomatoes potatoes bananas and lettuce 
critics of the plans say it will boost consumer food prices and 
cause hardships for growers 
used by farmers since the 1930s to combat fungus and mildew the 
pesticides which include some such as maneb and zineb familiar to 
home gardners have been linked to cancer 
although hailed by the bush administration as a move to protect 
consumers the epa announcement is producing some concerns as it 
gradually sinks in 
for example rep charles hatcher dga chairman of the house 
agriculture subcommittee on domestic marketing consumer relations 
and nutrition has been contacted by farm groups in georgia who are 
concerned about the planned curb on ebdcs 
press secretary krista harden said hatcher is consulting with a 
state coalition that has formed around the ebdc issue and may hold 
hearings on the subject when congress returns in january 
the ban is too severe said lowell peavy owner of peavy 
farm service in camilla ga which sells fertilizer to local 
farmers we fear we are going to fall in the same category as the 
apple people with alar 
peavy said he fears area farmers will stop producing without 
ebdcs and that will hurt his fertilizer business 
the product is the main fungicide used on leafy vegetables said 
peavy who said it can easily be washed off 
but if you ate the plant without washing it you would have to 
eat 13000 pounds of it to get the amount the rat had on the 
test said peavy 
he said the coalition of producers and agribusinessmen he is 
leading which calls itself the american food security coalition 
wants congress to stop the epa from removing ebdc from the market 
he said the group is contacting georgias two senators and 
congressmen from farm areas 
in idaho where potatoes are high on the financial menu gov 
cecil andrus advised his states congressional delegation in 
letters that the epa decision is causing havoc 
we need a competent credible environmental protection agency 
to deal with the multitude of environmental concerns he said 
we do not need an agncy that deals in scare tactics and 
misinformation 
much of the epas case against ebdcs rests on laboratory tests 
that show a byproduct of the fungicide called etu causes cancer in 
animals and likely causes cancer in humans if lifelong exposure is 
significant 
health experts say chronic exposure to ebdcs also raises the 
risks of birth defects or thyroid disorders 
in september manufacturers of ebdcs announced they would 
voluntarily halt sales of the fungicide for use on 42 food products 
at the end of this year accounting for about 40 percent to 50 
percent of the total sold annually 
however epa administrator william reilly said on dec 4 that 
the voluntary ban doesnt go far enough and should be extended to 
tomatoes potatoes and bananas which together account for nearly 
onethird of the ebdcs used 
the agriculture department nominally the governmental voice and 
defender of american farmers has been quiet since the epa 
announcement 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter joined epas reilly and 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan in a statement 
defending the plan to cancel some of the ebdc pesticides 
the statement expressed confidence that american consumers can 
continue to eat fruits and vegetables without fearing the 
potential risks of the chemicals at least until an epa market 
basket survey is completed in 1991 to determine how much of the 
ebdcs are potentially present 
kelly shipp yeutters press secretary said yeutter has not 
elaborated beyond that statement since epa announced its plan 
sen patrict leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee called for a wholesale reform of our pesticide laws 
instead of tentative half steps that may take years to 
accomplish 
but sen james a mcclure ridaho warned against a further 
tightening of federal restrictions the epa curb on fungicides is 
just a beginning he told the states farm bureau last week 
epa now has a bit in its teeth and they are running he 
said they will push as far as they can go and they will test to 
see how far they can push 
the american farm bureau federation the nations largest farm 
organization offered guarded comment it is appropriate said 
federation president dean kleckner to review the ebdc situation 
but a ban on the use of some of the fungicides would pose hardships 
for many 
crops especially those grown in humid regions are vulnerable 
to fungal diseases such as mold mildew rot and scab he said 
there are simply no satisfactory alternatives for many of the 
prescribed ebdc uses 
kleckner cited a recent study by grc economics a washington 
dc consulting firm which concluded the loss of all fungicides 
would reduce fruit production by 32 percent and vegetables by 21 
percent consumer food prices would rise 13 percent overall the 
study said

the governments 83 billion sale of its water 
industry was 57 times oversubscribed attracting the second 
highest number of applicants for a british privatization officials 
said monday 
demand for shares of the 10 water authorities of england and 
wales was strong enough to trigger clawback provisions that 
will give small investors nearly half the stock instead of the 
previously planned 27 percent 
most investors will get far fewer shares than they asked for in 
the sale which totals 524 billion pounds 
it is a great success environment minister michael howard 
said we have proved our critics wrong 
some 27 million people made applications the second highest 
response ever for a government privatization after the 45 million 
applicants in british gas plc sale 
there had been concern that the sale would be unsuccessful 
because the stock market has been in the doldrums and the 
privatization has faced stiff opposition from critics who believed 
such a vital utility should remain governmentowned 
trading in the shares officially begins tuesday on londons 
stock exchange in the gray or unofficial market the shares 
were trading at 126 pence or 199 at midday monday 
the government is selling 2183 million shares at 240 pence or 
379 each but investors only put 100 pence down and pay the rest 
off in installments 
under the clawback provisions in the water sale 
institutional investors now will get 39 percent of the shares and 
foreign investors the remainder each investor everyone will get at 
least 100 shares 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off billions of pounds worth of stateowned companies in the

american telephone amp telegraph co plans to trim 
another 8500 jobs from its work force in 1990 after cutting about 
25000 this year the company confirmed today 
atampt spokesman walter g murphy said the company has been 
planning next years reductions for some time and already has 
notified employees 
the people in the departments that are affected by the job 
reductions planned for 1990 have been informed he said 
the wall street journal reported on the cuts in todays editions 
and quoted unidentified sources as saying that they could be part 
of a wider work force reduction campaign in 1990 
murphy declined to characterize the reductions or to comment on 
how sweeping they would be 
most of the 1990 reductions will occur in atampts network 
services division which has 37600 workers and runs atampts 
longdistance network murphy said employees were told on nov 28 
of plans to reduce the division staff by 6000 jobs 
additionally the company plans to cut 700 jobs in its business 
communications systems unit 1400 jobs in its material management 
amp service unit and 400 jobs in its general business systems 
division in 1990 
the business communications systems unit which supplies office 
phone services to big businesses has 15000 workers while the 
general business systems division which handles phone service for 
smaller companies has 11200 workers material management amp 
services has 8700 workers 
murphy said advances in technology have been behind much of the 
job cutting at atampt the company envisioned thousands of cuts as it 
upgrades its longdistance phone network to a more efficient 
digital system by the end of next year for instance 
the big communications company has intensified its efforts to 
steamline operations lately by automating factories and backoffice 
facilities and by breaking itself down into smaller more focused 
units 
atampt has almost frozen hiring and instead has redeployed 
existing staff into vacant positions 
were on a drive to rightsize this place to be competitive 
harold w burlingame vice president of human resources at atampt 
told the journal our managers are quickly learning that they 
must focus on costs customers and competitors 
most of this years cuts have come through early retirement or 
attrition but several thousand have come through unannounced cuts 
since 1984 when the company divested its regional operating 
companies atampt has cut about 90000 jobs the company will have a 
payroll of about 280000 employees by january

free enterprise got free rein in the early years driving the

but that unbridled pursuit of wealth turned americans queasy 
well before the end of the decade ambition fostered as much greed 
as achievement and great successes often were matched oneforone 
by crises 
the economys durable growth was threatened by an overhang of 
debt the bull market produced scandals and a black monday crash

hostages came home from iran and ronald reagan took office 
promising to reawaken this industrial giant to get government 
back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden 
within months reagan broke an illegal strike by the air traffic 
controllers union and proposed a giant tax cut 
that same year international business machines corp rolled out 
its first personal computer in a strike against young steve jobs 
and steve wozniak at apple computer inc with ibms blessing the 
pc changed from a futuristic gadget into a deadly serious business 
tool 
in finance jutbrowed michael milken just 35 in 1981 was 
using highyielding junk bonds to raise money for companies 
shunned by traditional bond buyers companies like fastgrowing 
mci communications corp 
william mcgowan mcis baggyeyed gladiator used junk bonds and 
the federal courts in an assault on the worlds largest company 
american telephone amp telegraph co in 1982 atampt succumbed to 
government antitrust lawyers and agreed to the 1984 breakup of the 
bell system 
the walls were tumbling down across the atlantic margaret 
thatcher was dismantling british socialism with a vengeance 
markets became freer as well in western europe which envisioned a 
true common marketplace by 1992 and japan which grew into a 
global economic powerhouse 
in the united states the buoyant new spirit was best understood 
in contrast with the 1970s a brutal decade marred by the vietnam 
war watergate two oilprice shocks stagflation and ineffective 
government tinkering with the economy 
richard nixon had tried wage and price controls gerald ford had 
passed out win buttons promising to whip inflation now as late as 
1980 jimmy carter was trying to discipline the economy with the 
first peacetime credit controls in us history including curbs on 
the use of credit cards banks prime lending rate briefly topped 
21 percent in 1980 and the price of gold an inflation refuge 
surpassed 800 an ounce 
reagan came into office with a radically different agenda 
convinced that cutting tax rates would unleash so much economic 
activity that tax revenue would actually increase arthur laffer 
had sketched out the supplyside theory on a napkin in 1974 
it didnt happen exactly as reagan wished the tax cuts produced 
fat budget deficits fortunately for him though budget deficits 
are painless at least in the short run the pain was inflicted by 
paul volcker the stern 6foot7 chairman of the federal reserve 
who pushed up interest rates to squeeze out inflation 
volckers medicine produced the deepest recession since world 
war ii with unemployment rates topping 10 percent in the summer of 
1982 but it did wring inflationary expectations out of the system 
and by that november the economy began an expansion that continues 
to this day the longest in us peacetime history 
in contrast to the inwardlooking me decade americans looked 
outward in the 80s because the business world demanded it the old 
order was fractured and they were forced to make new choices 
fixedrate mortgage or adjustable ira or 401k atampt or mci or 
sprint 
carter had launched deregulation in airlines trucking and 
banking but it was reagan who became the movements spiritual 
godfather 
the money decade made economic creatures of us all business 
news leaped to the front page financial news network was born lee 
iacocca became a bestselling author dallas and lifestyles 
of the rich and famous were voyeuristic hits 
americans exulted in capitalism in the early 80s none more 
than phoenix financier charles keating who built an empire by 
buying savings and loans and speculating with the money deposited 
in them 
by 1989 charles keating faced accusations that he had looted or 
abused depositors funds while bribing us senators with political 
donations 
keatings downfall capped a series of events beginning in the 
mid1980s that turned many americans against the excesses of the 
decade all three revolutions political financial and 
technological were in some way tarnished 
in 1985 the united states world champion of free enterprise 
became a net debtor for the first time since the eve of world war i 
in november 1986 ivan boesky surrendered 100 million and 
agreed to plead guilty to a felony as a budding government probe of 
insider trading sideswiped wall streets roaring bull market 
on oct 19 1987 the dow jones industrial average plunged a 
record 508 points intensifying concerns about the health and 
fairness of the markets 
in 1988 americans learned that the previous years trade 
deficit had hit a record 152 billion a hemorrhage of 4800 a 
second 
the crowning blow came in 1989 when taxpayers found out that 
the deregulated and fraudriddled savings and loan industry would 
require a 159 billion bailout 
it began to seem the reagan revolution had not kept the united 
states from digging itself into a deep hole of debt that 
untrammeled markets could get dangerously out of balance and that 
deregulation had opened the cookie jar to shameless thieves 
even the longlived economic expansion was less impressive when 
it became apparent how little it had done to raise living 
standards after adjustment for inflation hourly earnings of 
nonsupervisory workers actually were lower throughout the 1980s 
than in 1969

thus came the reaction 
in politics reagan belied his freetrading reputation by 
signing legislation protecting american steel autos textiles and 
sugar his administration quit its laissezfaire attitude toward 
the overvalued dollar which threatened to gut american industry by 
making imports a better buy than goods made in the usa 
government supervision of the savings and loans was toughened 
and there were moves toward reregulation of airlines cable 
television the financial markets clean air and job safety 
meanwhile each foreign purchase of an american institution 
cbs records columbia pictures rockefeller center burger king 
brought fresh calls for restrictions on foreign ownership 
the more liberal lawmakers even dared call for an industrial 
policy a coordinated program for rebuilding americas economic 
strength that sounded to conservatives like wasteful lemon 
socialism 
by late in the decade polls showed americans viewed japan as a 
bigger threat than the soviet union proof that the money decade 
had wrought changes in attitudes about money and power 
in finance milkens revolution lost some of its luster as junk 
bonds became associated in the publics mind with hostile 
takeovers heavy debts from buyouts and mergers sapped momentum 
from the takeover rush and prompted questions about the wisdom of 
financing through leverage 
while some takeovers promoted efficiency by forcing managers to 
lop off unproductive enterprises they also forced undue emphasis 
on shortterm profitability to pay off debt in direct contrast to 
the forwardthinking japanese 
corporations erected sophisticated defenses to ward off takeover 
threats and some states even passed laws to keep out raiders the 
crashrattled financial markets meanwhile imposed circuit 
breakers to forestall another collapse 
the technology revolution came through mostly unscathed 
powerful personal computers seemed to be on every desk 
biotechnology gave new life to medicine and fiber optics turned the 
phone network into an eightlane voice and data expressway 
if the technological advances had a dark side it was the fear 
that too many people were left behind by an economy based on 
knowledge and skill laborers and clerks were replaced by machinery 
or silicon chips an unskilled despairing underclass grew 
increasingly detached from the rest of society 
the revolutions and reactions of the money decade echoed a 
historic american theme the contest between liberty and equality 
more liberty generally means less equality less liberty means more 
equality 
the contest far from resolved here at home now engages a world 
of players as the 90s approach 
out of desperation mikhail gorbachevs soviet union eastern 
europe and latin america are giving oncehated capitalism a chance 
in spite of the risk of upheaval a new soviet opinion poll shows 
widespread resentment of the newly rich and craving for a return to 
a strong hand over the economy 
for those who will struggle with the choices of free enterprise 
in the future the 80s left clear warnings more growth can equal 
less security with freedom comes the responsibility to manage 
greedy extremes 
americans lived that dilemma in the 1980s now the rest of the 
world is taking its turn

americans overwhelmingly believe the united 
states has fumbled away its economic supremacy to japan in the 
1980s yet few expect their personal finances to suffer in the 
coming decade a national survey has found 
nearly seven in 10 respondents in the media generalassociated 
press poll said they believe japan not the united states is the 
leading economic power in the world today just 26 percent said 
america leads 
at the same time however fewer than two in 10 respondents said 
their familys finances had worsened in the past 10 years and 
fewer still just 13 percent expected their finances to 
deteriorate in the decade ahead 
the youngest respondents aged 18 to 29 were the most 
optimistic about their financial future and they were the least 
apt to believe the united states economic position has slipped in 
the past decade 
but their elders were solidly convinced of the united states 
slide six in 10 said the countrys economic leadership weakened in 
the 1980s while just 14 percent believed the us economy grew 
stronger 
despite that perception there was only minority support for a 
greater federal role in industrial development fiftyone percent 
preferred to have market forces direct industrys fortunes while 
37 percent said they favored government help in financing selected 
industries the rest were unsure 
opinion was divided on some factors in the nations economic 
performance in the 1980s respondents split evenly on whether 
government deregulation had been good or bad for the economy and 
they also split on whether the stock market had been a help or 
hindrance 
but there was general agreement on other issues nearly seven in 
10 said competition from foreign imports had hurt the economy in 
the past decade and about six in 10 said foreign investment in the 
united states had hurt 
even more nearly eight in 10 said the federal deficit had 
damaged the economy about half said corporate mergers had hurt 
with others split on whether mergers helped or made no difference 
of all the factors posed only one was widely seen as a benefit 
the increasing number of women in the work force was said by 77 
percent to have helped the economy in the 1980s men and women 
shared that view equally 
on many issues opinion split along political lines republicans 
were a bit more sanguine about us economic leadership 48 percent 
of them said it had weakened vs 61 percent of democrats and 
independents 
similarly 31 percent of the republicans polled picked the 
united states as the worlds leading economy today while just 23 
percent of the others agreed and 40 percent of republicans and 
independents said deregulation had been good for the economy vs 
28 percent of the democrats 
more republicans may hold positive views of the economy because 
more were doing better sixtyfive percent said their familys 
financial situation had improved in the 1980s that fell to 46 
percent of democrats and 42 percent of the independents 
the poll was a telephone survey so the 7 percent of the 
population without phones generally the poorest americans could 
not be included in the telephone households contacted 52 percent 
overall said their family finances improved in the 1980s 18 
percent said they had worsened and 28 percent said they were about 
the same two percent didnt answer 
looking to the future 49 percent expected better finances in 
the decade ahead 13 percent expected to do worse and 34 percent 
expected their financial situation to remain about the same four 
percent had no answer 
the survey was conducted nov 1725 among 1117 adults and had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points

it has produced cutrate airline tickets 
higher interest rates for savers and lower longdistance costs 
but the deregulation of american enterprise carries a price tag 
too 
for openers theres the 50 billion now plus perhaps 100 
billion later to bail out the savings and loan industry in 
trouble before deregulation and in worsening straits afterward 
with the bailout came belatedly a stringent system of regulation 
to oversee every facet of the industry 
the lowcost air service that is said to be saving travelers and 
shippers more than 14 billion a year doesnt reach everywhere 
fares into smaller noncompetitive cities are as steep or steeper 
than before 
deregulation in telecommunications is still contentious in the 
courts and in congress longdistance costs less some local 
services more there are a dozen bills seeking some measure of 
reregulation of cable television 
in other deregulated industries some prices are higher some 
services lacking and surveys indicate that wages are generally 
lower than would be the case had regulation remained 
overall though the consensus among economic analysts is that 
the united states is better off with deregulation than without it 
among economists that judgment spans the political spectrum 
conservative to liberal theres less unanimity among politicians 
some of whom pick targets and threaten regulatory moves to get at 
them 
theres been congressional talk for example of regulation to 
make sure that television viewers dont someday have to pay to see 
the pro football super bowl 
deregulation has been a selective process new dealera 
regulation of industry and transportation has been phased out 
while regulation involving the environment health and safety has 
been increasing 
while there may be a backlash on some issues nobody expects a 
reversal of the trend toward deregulation 
unless you repeal technology i dont think youll ever be 
able to go back to the old regulated system said james l 
gattuso regulatory affairs analyst at the conservative heritage 
foundation 
a bill making its way through congress would have the government 
intervene against airline takeovers on safety or competitive 
grounds a measure opposed by the administration as creeping 
reregulation 
a more drastic measure proposed by sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio with two republican cosponsors would have the government 
reinstate regulation of fares routes and service while that is 
not likely to pass it reflects discontent with some of the fallout 
of deregulation 
congress is going to do a little tinkering to show that 
theyre doing something said clifford winston a brookings 
institution specialist on deregulation in the transportation 
industry 
ronald reagan was president during much of the deregulation 
decade and his administration boasted of easing or undoing 
shackles on business but little was accomplished after his first 
term 
major regulatory overhauls of the past decade were shaped before 
reagans presidency some by democrats indeed sen edward m 
kennedy dmass was an early advocate of airline deregulation 
which began while jimmy carter was president 
economist william a niskanen a former reagan economic adviser 
flunked the last republican administration on regulatory relief and 
reform although this program started with a bang it ended with 
a whimper he wrote 
near the end of reagans first term attempts to rein in the 
regulatory establishment virtually ceased according to a study 
by melinda warren and kenneth chilton at the center for the study 
of american business in st louis 
warren and chilton found that regulatory agencies grew during 
his administration with two notable exceptions the civil 
aeronautics board which used to regulate airline routes and fares 
was shut down and the interstate commerce commission cut its 
spending by nearly twothirds 
the environmental protection agency grew the most with spending 
up 70 percent during the two reagan terms the government spends 
more than four times as much on social regulation to protect 
health safety and the environment as it spends on economic 
regulation 
among the landmarks of deregulation in the 1980s 
airlines route and rate decontrol began in 1978 the civil 
aeronautics board was shut down in 1982 the federal aviation 
administration regulates the airlines on safety matters estimates 
of the economic benefits of an expanding airline industry range up 
to about 15 billion a year fares are about 29 percent lower than 
they would have been without deregulation according to a brookings 
analysis 
but there also have been bankruptcies and more than a dozen 
major takeovers prompting the proposals for revived regulation 
and the growth in air travel also has led to airport congestion and 
delays 
broadcasting most programming requirements and limits on 
commercials were dropped by the federal communications commission 
first for radio then in 1984 for television station license 
renewals were simplified as programming checks were dropped a 
lottery system supplanted fitness exams as the basis for choosing 
among competitors for new licenses in such fields as cellular 
telephone service lowpower and pay television systems 
the reagan fcc dropped the fairness doctrine which had required 
balance in broadcast coverage of controversial issues the 
democraticcontrolled congress is trying to reinstate it 
the deregulation trend dates from the carter administration 
when the fcc eased cable television restrictions and began the 
process for broadcasters 
telephone service the breakup of american telephone amp 
telegraph co completed what had begun nearly 20 years before when 
democrat lyndon b johnson was president the 1982 settlement 
effective in 1984 split telephone operating companies away from 
atampt and set rules fostering competition in longdistance service 
that eased regulation but didnt undo it on longdistance rates 
which still are subject to the fcc and state regulators 
banking the thrifts were already in trouble before congress 
voted to ease regulation of the investments they could make and the 
amount of interest they could offer depositors shaky savings and 
loans could and did make highrisk investments to try to pull 
even speculators had an easy time attracting money because the 
government insured deposits 
the danger of default was not so clear in the early 1980s the 
reagan administration unsuccessfully sought broader deregulation 
on the theory that banks and savings and loans could then compete 
more effectively in a changing financial world president bush 
confronted a worsening sampl crisis when he took office and answered 
with the bailout bill he signed last summer 
trucking railroad freight they were partly deregulated under 
legislation passed in 1980 before reagan surveys point to lower 
shipping costs winston at the brookings institution is about to 
publish a study that will indicate savings and benefits in surface 
transportation of more than 14 billion 
one analyst reviewing the decade in 1988 said economic 
deregulation reduced prices and costs in every industry in which it 
was tried roger noll a stanford university economist said the 
benefit didnt show everywhere because in some places especially 
rural america regulators had set prices below costs and offset 
them by charging more elsewhere 
noll said deregulation increased employment in the industries 
involved but at generally lower wages savings that represent a 
substantial share of the reduction in prices and costs 
for all of that as he noted in a study published by the 
american enterprise institute the regulatory structure that was in 
place 20 years ago is almost intact 
no major overhaul is in prospect the bush administration is 
committed to deregulation as vice president george bush headed a 
task force on regulatory reform but regulatory change is not high 
on the administrations priority list

the nations largest airline company is a 
conglomeration of big and small carriers flying under the regional 
banner of texas air corp 
almost every other major carrier has been a target for takeover 
or restructuring 
airports are clogged fares are inscrutable and the commercial 
fleet is showing its age with frightening regularity 
that is probably not the future the architects of deregulation 
imagined in 1978 when the airline industry was freed from 
government control over fares and routes 
but that future is now after little more than a decade of 
freewheeling competition 
for business students of the 1980s there was no more compelling 
case study of the impact of reaganera deregulation no industry 
underwent more wrenching changes none moved from controls to 
competition to consolidation as quickly 
in october 1988 the airlines celebrated their first decade of 
freedom less than a year later the industry was engulfed by a 
wave of takeover fever its second since deregulation began 
im uneasy about the wave of buyouts said alfred kahn a 
former chairman of the civil aeronautics board who is widely 
considered the father of airline deregulation the critical thing 
is how does it affect competition 
in the space of a week last august united airlines the 
nations secondlargest carrier was put into play by a 54 
billion buyout bid for parent ual corp from oilman marvin davis 
an investor group completed its 365 billion buyout of nwa inc 
parent of northwest airlines frequently rumored takeover target 
usair group inc completed its merger with piedmont aviation and 
separately sold a major stake to white knight investor warren 
buffett and a manufacturing company said it might consider a 
takeover of midway airlines 
while the fierce competition sparked by deregulation turned many 
airlines into hot properties it put others in desperate straits 
in 1989 three carriers filed for bankruptcy protection under 
chapter 11 texas airs eastern airlines hit by a crippling strike 
in early march braniff inc which filed for the second time in 
seven years and presidential airways a feeder carrier for united 
as some companies faltered the takeover frenzy continued to 
build culminating in developer donald trumps 75 billion buyout 
proposal in october for amr corp parent of industry leader 
american airlines 
when ual failed to assemble financing for its 675 billion 
pilotmanagement buyout an announcement that caused a sudden 
190point drop in the dow jones industrial average on oct 13 the 
mania subsided temporarily 
but ual talks revived and experts said the reshaping of the 
industry will continue in the 90s 
airlines in western europe are positioning themselves to exploit 
the common market deregulation set to begin in 1992 and some are 
swooping down to buy pieces of us carriers 
the prospect of foreign ownership and the heavy debts associated 
with takeovers have prompted warnings from officials in washington 
including transportation secretary samuel skinner 
under us law foreign airlines arent allowed to own more than 
25 percent of the voting stock of domestic carriers in october 
skinner used his authority to force klm royal dutch airlines the 
foreign partner in the nwa deal to cut its 400 million investment 
by 225 million 
for travelers the fallout from deregulation has been even more 
worrisome 
the number of passengers on us airlines jumped to around 455 
million in 1988 from 275 million in 1978 according to the air 
transport association by the year 2000 traffic is projected to be 
800 million or 900 million people 
theres nowhere near enough capacity in the system runways 
airport space and air traffic control to handle the onslaught 
the nations commercial fleet meanwhile has been aging 
rapidly from an average 85 years old in 1978 to 125 a decade 
later aging aircraft have been blamed for some terrifying 
accidents in recent years and have compelled thriving big airlines 
to buy new jets 
to upgrade their fleets major us carriers spent a record 67 
billion in the first 11 months of 1989 on 1600 new planes boeing 
co the largest commercial aircraft maker cannot keep pace its 
backlog swollen further by the machinists union strike that ended 
nov 20 is now worth 85 billion 
the problems and the concern about safety they have prompted 
have intensified pressure on the federal government to reregulate 
the industry kahn and others warn proposals to reregulate the 
airlines emerged in congress in early november 
the industry hopes it will be allowed to work out the problems 
as for the lack of capacity theres a lot of immediate things 
that can be done eastern president phil bakes said in an 
interview bakes a former attorney for the cab was influential in 
drawing up the 1978 deregulation law 
as a sign of progress he pointed to the first meeting in 
midoctober of the aviation system capacity task force a group 
that includes representatives of the major airlines airport 
operators and the federal aviation administration 
skinners department is developing a new us transportation 
policy to take the country into the 21st century and the faas new 
system capacity office will help expedite the rebuilding of the 
infrastructure 
if those efforts fail skinner warned we will lose the 
benefits of deregulation

since the nations airline industry was 
deregulated in october 1978 a debate has raged on the benefits and 
problems created by the move 
among the main benefits according to supporters and industry 
experts 
a democratization of air travel formerly the domain of 
relatively few americans the number of passengers on us airlines 
jumped to around 455 million last year from 275 million in 1978 by 
the year 2000 that traffic is widely projected to surge to 800 
million or 900 million people 
with nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of 
discount fare the average price of a plane ticket dropped 21 
percent from 1978 to 1988 with inflation taken into account 
according to the air transport association 
a planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere 
in the country on an average of every 48 seconds 
several studies of airline deregulation contend that travelers 
and the economy as a whole have benefited 
the downside 
growing complaints about the concentration of the industry 
around a few megacarriers and about the dominance they wield 
in and out of some cities and through links with commuter airlines 
to entire regions of the country 
unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies 
surrounding them with some airport planners resorting to high 
landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft 
concerns about aviation safety critics both in and out of the 
industry complain that the government is unable to keep up with 
traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a continuing 
high level of safety 
predictions of catastrophe and reregulation of the industry 
unless airports are expanded new airports are built and the air 
traffic control system is modernized 
complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate 
especially in rural areas while prices are allowed to soar 
unfairly high in some markets especially between busy hub 
airports dominated by one or two airlines 
a realization that the days of aviation entrepreneurs starting 
an airline from scratch and taking on the competition have long 
passed the victim of the same megacarriers

most americans probably dont remember it but a 
war broke out on aug 25 1982 
it was a confrontation involving four huge us corporations 
that ended with bendix corp initially the aggressor getting 
swallowed up and disappearing under the wing of allied corp 
it may seem remote and insignificant now but this fight from 
the early 1980s helped shape a decade of wild and expensive 
takeover battles that peaked in 1988 with the 25 billion purchase 
of rjr nabisco inc and stumbled just two months ago with the 
collapse of a planned 675 billion buyout of ual corp 
throughout the decade takeovers had a constant companion 
controversy businessmen economists and lawmakers debated whether 
takeovers were good or bad for companies employees and the country 
the bendix war introduced the concept of the hostile takeover 
bid to many americans led by highprofile chairman william agee 
bendix fired the first shot that august with an unwanted bid for 
martin marietta corp 
martin marietta fought back trying to gobble up bendix in what 
became known as the pacman defense and united technologies 
corp and allied corp also entered the fray 
by the time the battle ended in january 1983 bendix had 
selfdestructed and become part of allied in a 2 billion buyout 
and both martin marietta and allied were deeply in debt 
then in 1985 just a little over two years after acquiring 
bendix allied merged with signal cos inc in a 49 billion deal 
as the decade progressed buyouts got bigger and bigger in 
1988 they reached their zenith with the buyout of rjr nabisco by 
the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co also during the 
year philip morris cos inc bought kraft inc for 129 billion 
and grand metropolitan plc acquiredpillsbury co for 568 billion 
even as the stakes were raised one deal was launched that would 
begin to push the pendulum of merger mania back the other way the 
66 billion purchase of federated department stores inc by 
canadas campeau corp in april 1988 helped send takeovers to 
their nadir 18 months later 
junk bonds the breakfast of all takeover champions proved too 
hard for investors to swallow in the campeau deal 
thehighrisk highyield bonds had made it possible for just 
about anybody on the block to get some action going said jerome 
e hass a professor of managerial economics and finance at cornell 
universitys johnson graduate school of management 
but some big dealmakers campeau chief among them took on 
more debt than they could handle and could not make their interest 
payments after campeaus troubles became known the junkbond 
market plunged and suddenly it seemed next to impossible to find 
money for a deal 
no one learned that lesson harder than ual corp this fall 
pilots and senior managers of ual couldnt get enough banks to 
finance their planned buyout of the parent of united airlines and 
the deal collapsed on oct 13 dragging the stock market down with 
it news of the failed buyout sent the dow jones industrial average 
plummeting 190 points 
takeovers were a factor in some of wall streets best and worst 
performances during the 1980s speculation about buyouts helped 
propel the market to record highs but the possibility that the 
takeover boom was ending contributed to the oct 19 1987 crash and 
the markets most recent slide 
amid the turmoil the rjr nabisco deal continued to shine even 
though the record buyout was accomplished with 4 billion of junk 
bonds cash from the companys food and tobacco business was 
expected to easily service its massive debt load 
but even with such bright spots as rjr nabisco all the takeover 
battles soaring debt levels and market gyrations unsettled many 
americans 
workers whose companies were taken over found themselves facing 
layoffs as new owners cut costs local officials worried about the 
effect takeovers would have on their communities congressmen 
warned that companies saddled with massive interest payments could 
fail jeopardizing the solvency of banks that helped finance the 
deals 
other critics citing the profits many investors made from 
takeovers said there was just too much greed 
but supporters of the takeover process including the bidders 
themselves said buyouts improved the efficiency of companies 
because unnecessary jobs and expenses were eliminated that made 
the firms more profitable and able to expand and that was good for 
the economy they said 
hass noted that companies that were potential targets have 
cleaned up their act by restructuring and paring costs takeovers 
indirectly helped those firms he said 
the negative atmosphere surrounding takeovers spawned new state 
laws seeking to shield companies their employees and communities 
from becoming the pawns of takeover strategists 
suitors tried to dismantle the statutes but in 1987 the us 
supreme court ruled the states had the right to pass laws curbing 
hostile takeovers 
the new statutes gave companies more muscle to fight unwanted 
bids in delaware where more than half the fortune 500 companies 
are incorporated a new law allowed polaroid corp to use an 
employee stock ownership plan and other devices to defeat a hostile 
bid by shamrock holdings inc 
state courts also became deeply involved in shaping takeover law 
and helped determine the outcome of several major fights 
delaware courts stopped paramount communications incs hostile 
bid for time inc allowing time and warner communications inc to 
proceed with a 14 billion merger 
legal obstacles helped persuade strategists including t boone 
pickens jr and asher edelman to give up hostile takeovers they 
said the process had become too complicated and too expensive and 
they turned their attention toward overseas targets europe for 
edelman and japan for pickens 
for dealmakers of the future caution may be in greater supply 
than junk bonds 
said hass only mergers or acquisitions that make economic 
sense are going to prevail

ten years ago its holdings included 600000 
acres of timberland 425 music stores 50000 employees and 16 
billion in machinery used to make dixie cups paper towels and the 
packages used to hold toothpaste beer and frozen foods 
today it has 484 loan offices 270000 credit card accounts 
190000 life insurance agents and 35000 representatives registered 
to sell mutual funds 
if any one company exemplifies what happened to business in the 
1980s it may be primerica corp the former american can co 
which in the decade transformed itself from manufacturing to 
financial services 
while some differ on the wisdom of the trend economists agree 
the 1980s were a time when the economys shift from manufacturing 
to services accelerated 
from 1979 to 1987 the number of jobs in manufacturing dropped 
from 21 million to 19 million while jobs in the service sector 
grew from 63 million to 77 million according to statistics from 
the us census bureau 
manufacturings share of the gross national product fell from 
225 percent in 1979 to 208 percent in 1985 according to a 1989 
study by lawrence r mishel research director at the economic 
policy institute in washington 
american can was formed at the turn of the century from 123 
small canning firms and can manufacturers business prospered 
through the 1950s as a growing number of manufacturers sought 
packaging for everything from tomato paste to tennis balls 
when growth began to slow in the 1950s american can diversified 
by moving into paper products printing and various recycling 
businesses in the 1970s it moved into retailing buying outfits 
like musicland record stores and the fingerhut mailorder house 
the big move into financial services came in the 1980s it began 
in 1982 when american can bought associated madison cos inc a 
life insurance holding company for 127 million associateds 
chairman financial whiz gerald tsai jr came on board to engineer 
the transformation into financial services an industry he saw as 
fragmented and leaning toward deregulation 
american can spent the next several years buying more than 1 
billion worth of insurance and other financial businesses and 
selling off paper and packaging operations and all its retail 
interests except for fingerhut 
as the american economy boomed in the mid1980s so did the 
transformed american can in 1987 for the third straight year the 
companys insurance lines sold more life insurance than any other 
us group revenues from financial services grew net income 
almost doubled from 1983 to 1986 
by then financial services accounted for more than 70 percent 
of the companys profits 
american can changed its name to primerica on april 28 1987 
one month later it added frosting to the cake spending 750 
million to buy smith barney the esteemed old wall street firm 
the move seemed smart until five months later when the stock 
market crashed as wall street stumbled so did primerica whose 
net income dropped smith barney had pretax losses of 93 million 
in 1987 and 53 million in 1988 
i remember thinking this was not going to be very good for the 
old primerica because they just bought smith barney said sanford 
j weill now primericas chairman it turned out to happen at a 
wrong time smith barney didnt do well for a year and a half 
but like the market primerica was far from sunk in december 
1988 it was bought by commercial credit group inc weill as 
chairman of commercial credit took over from tsai and is presiding 
in new manhattan headquarters as the company tries to become a 
force in financial services 
just this year primerica announced that its commercial credit 
was buying the branch offices and loan portfolio of barclays 
americanfinancial for 135 billion the purchase is expected to 
strengthen commercial credits position as one of the countrys 
major consumer and homeequity lenders 
not all is perfect in primericas future one of the same 
question marks that faces the american economy entering the 1990s 
also faces the company the financial markets continuing 
volatility seen in the 190point drop in the dow jones industrial 
average on oct 13 
that kind of volatility when it comes so fast with no notice 
people say is this really a safe place to put our money weill 
said i think we have a real job to do to get the individual to 
believe in investing in equities again in this country 
but weill remains optimistic that financial services is a good 
place to be in the 1990s if troubles affect smith barney 
primerica can still count on earnings from its commercial credit 
and life insurance businesses he said

in 1980 campeau corp was a canadian developer 
virtually unknown in the united states then it went on a spending 
spree fed by junk bonds and ended up owning many major us 
department store chains 
today campeau cant pay debts and has been forced to put its 
prized bloomingdales on the block 
ten years ago the federal deficit stood at 6636 billion and 
many thought it a disgrace the nation was living beyond its means 
then the deficit ballooned out of control during the reagan years 
quadrupling to 28 trillion today 
about 200000 americans filed for personal bankruptcy in 1979 
by last year the figure topped 540000 after a creditcard binge 
that led one bank to issue plastic to children 
the 1980s was the decade of debt junk bonds gold cards 
leveraged buyouts deficit spending all became standards of the 
age as companies consumers and the government loaded up with 
borrowed money as never before 
this certainly will be the decade that america exploded in 
debt said roger e brinner chief economist for the economic 
consulting firm drimcgrawhill inc 
leverage is a word that may be forever linked with the 
1980s added john lonski senior economist with moodys investors 
service inc 
corporate debt nearly tripled from 774 billion at the start of 
1980 to more than 2 trillion as the decade closed 
much of that is due to a takeover and buyout frenzy that 
reshaped corporate america and left many industrial titans 
teetering atop mountains of ious 
highrisk highyield securities labeled junk bonds 
ushered in the dominance of debt as a way for corporations to raise 
cash pushing the old standby of stock offerings into the 
background 
junk bonds made possible such megadeals as the record 25 
billion leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco inc they also led to the 
downfall of drexel burnham lambert inc and its chief junkbond 
trader michael milken 
debt in the 1980s also became a way for corporations to avoid 
the clutches of takeover artists by loading themselves up with 
debt obligations through selling bonds companies made themselves 
less appealing targets and made their shareholders happy with 
special dividends 
while milken and other dealmakers praised the power of debt to 
squeeze efficiency out of bloated oldline corporations the debt 
binge inspired doomsday scenarios in the minds of others 
some economists predict that corporate america will be deeply 
scarred by a recession a wave of bankruptcies plant closings and 
layoffs could be the price of the all the borrowing they warn 
when leaner economic times make it difficult to pay bondholders 
but others such as brinner are less pessimistic and say only 
the most highly leveraged companies would collapse 
many economists say the broader question about the nations debt 
binge is whether the borrowed money was wisely spent 
when it was used to improve plants and machinery to introduce 
new products and to build bridges schools and highways it was a 
good investment but when it was used by corporate financiers to 
churn money by taking companies private selling parts of them 
and then going public again there was little or no benefit to the 
economy these economists argue 
brinner said he is particularly troubled by the federal deficit 
which he calls a disease that is going to weaken us for years 
the federal debt is going to reduce our standard of living by 
about a quarter of a percent a year brinner said we borrowed 
this money not to finance expansion but to finance consumption 
household debt mushroomed from 131 trillion at the start of 
the decade to about 327 trillion as of this june according to 
moodys about twothirds of that debt represents mortgages while 
the rest is creditcard and other personal borrowing 
while junk bonds and leveraged buyouts stole the spotlight 
banks and financial houses learned new tricks with other forms of 
debt during the 1980s such as repackaging loan and creditcard 
portfolios into bonds that were sold to the public 
the decade also saw the explosive growth of mortgagebacked 
bonds from ginnie mae fannie mae and freddie mac three 
governmentcreated entities that buy mortgages from savings and 
loans and repackage them as bonds wall street firms earned huge 
profits dealing in these issues 
as the 80s came to a close there were signs that the national 
borrowing binge was losing steam 
creditcard spending by consumers appeared to slow as it lost 
its taxdeductibility under the 1986 tax code revision federal 
deficit spending was reined in by the grammrudman law the 
junkbond market skidded as some of the lbos of the 1980s became 
unglued 
but the years of deficit spending will take many more years to 
be paid off if they ever are some say the united states already 
is paying for its livefortoday attitude which has been blamed 
for a dearth of research and development investment and a decline 
in the nations technological edge

levi strauss disappeared from industrial 
americas bestknown roster sold in a management buyout 
lone star industries became too small to qualify 
international telephone amp telegraph was reclassified and appears 
on a separate service company list 
for a variety of reasons upwards of onethird of the companies 
included at the end of the 1970s on the fortune 500 ranking of the 
nations biggest industrial concerns were missing from the same 
list a decade later 
the buyout wave of the 1980s was a major factor in the sweeping 
changes in the fortune 500 list combined sales rose 66 percent to 
more than 2 trillion 
levi strauss which was no 177 on the list published in 1979 
last appeared among the fortune 500 in 1985 after which it was sold 
to management 
continental oil which ranked a lofty 18th on the 1979 list 
changed its name that year to conoco then vanished from the list 
after dupont co acquired it in 1981 
the flip side of the buyout wave has been that buyers generally 
moved up the list dupont was ranked ninth in 1989 up from no 16 
a decade earlier 
making an even bigger move was philip morris companies inc the 
cigarette manufacturer ranked 10th in 1989 and 46th in 1979 it 
bought general foods which was 41st in 1979 and kraft which was 
39th during the 1980s 
some companies dropped off the list meanwhile because they 
sold assets or failed to grow fast enough 
lone star industries which sold assets over the decade was no 
248 in 1979 and last appeared in 1987 
another big factor in the changes was an increasing emphasis on 
service businesses companies must derive at least 50 percent of 
their sales from manufacturing or mining to qualify for the 
magazines industrial rankings otherwise they are eligible for 
fortunes service 500 
that caused companies like itt ranked 11th on the 1979 
industrial list to be moved to the list of diversified service 
companies in 1988 
other prominent companies reclassified as service concerns 
during the 1980s included gulf amp western industries ranked 58th on 
the industrial list in 1979 and now known as paramount pictures 
inc and american can which was 66th in 1979 and is now called 
primerica 
the top of the fortune 500 industrial listing has been fairly 
stable despite the exodus of companies lower down 
eight of the top 10 in 1979 were still there in 1989 
the dropouts are standard oil of california now known as 
chevron and gulf oil which was acquired by chevron in 1984 
standard oil had been no 6 in 1979 and gulf oil was ninth chevron 
ranks 11th on the 1989 list 
they were replaced by the acquisitive dupont and philip morris 
general motors led the 1979 list with 632 billion in sales and 
remained at the top in 1989 with nearly twice as much 1211 
billion 
the 500th company in 1979 moved halfway up the ladder 
reflecting computer industry growth in the money decade 
data general was 500th in 1979 with sales of 3799 million and 
no 272 in 1989 with sales of 136 billion

the longest peacetime expansion in history the 
oftrepeated phrase rings hollow in the oil patch where the 
optimism of the early 80s dissolved to depression following the 
opecinduced collapse of the energy markets 
ditto in the midwest which became known as the rust bowl and 
on the plains where farmers suffered through drought and 
foreclosure 
and perhaps in the northeast where analysts now see recession 
not everybody has enjoyed 84 straight months of good times 
overall when you look at the macro numbers it looks pretty 
good but there have been all sorts of people who have 
suffered said edward yardeni the prudentialbache securities 
inc economist who identified the concept of a rolling recession 
which strikes different spots at different times 
try going into a bar in pittsburgh in 1984 85 or 86 and 
telling the steelworkers we havent had a recession theyd toss 
you out on your ear said yardeni 
if we can continue to have these rolling recessions knock 
some sense into all of us but one at a time instead of all at 
once then the nation as a whole is better off yardeni believes 
manufacturing had its recession in 1985 energy in 1986 and 
construction started its downturn at the end of last year said 
donald ratajczak head of the economic forecasting project at 
georgia state university in atlanta 
but none of them did it at the same time he said the 
southwest is just now starting to get its head above water while 
the darlings of the early 80s the northeast and new england are 
just beginning to slip and there are signs out west that their 
housing market has overdone it 
the rolling recession churns on 
many states that were winners since 1985 could turn out to be 
losers as the new decade begins said stephen pa brown senior 
economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas in some regions 
the reversal already has begun 
the party may be over in the northeast 
it already is the problem area said sara johnson managing 
economist for drimcgrawhill inc in lexington mass the 
northeast has experienced the slowest growth among all regions 
were saying the northeast is in a recession 
speculative overbuilding and weakness in the computer industry 
have led to the decline she said 
a report by financial industry consultant alex sheshunoff 
recently warned of weakening banks in the northeast as the 
overbuilding begins to take a toll just as it did in the southwest 
but whatever the northeasts problems they wont approach the 
southwests of the last few years 
when the 1980s opened the southwest was basking in expectations 
of 50abarrel oil while the rest of the country still was 
struggling 
when northeasterners complained about the high price of oil 
texans responded with bumper stickers saying let em freeze in 
the dark 
credit was there for the asking new office buildings sprouted 
like the states prized wildflowers dallas the primetime 
soap opera flaunted the texas high life and became one of the most 
popular shows on television 
then the organization of petroleum exporting countries began 
pumping more oil and prices fell to just over 10 a barrel too low 
to be profitable in the us oilfields 
bankruptcy became common unemployment exceeded 10 percent real 
estate agents took second jobs as hotel night clerks the collapse 
soon dragged down the states largest banks forcing the federal 
government to come to the rescue the more loosely regulated thrift 
industry with problems exacerbated by fraud and shadowy dealing 
became an embarrassment 
the longignored concept of diversification became dominant and 
the state began paying attention to education and industrial 
recruitment because if we cant rely on gods gifts we have to 
create our own gifts said economist tom fomby at southern 
methodist university 
texas successfully has turned to high technology wooing two 
computer consortiums to the capital austin richardson a suburb 
of dallas now bills itself as the telecom corridor based on the 
presence of northern telecoms main us research center plus the 
coming of large operations for mci and fujitsu 
while the southwest is only now recovering the southeast 
hasnt taken a recession in this decade georgia states 
ratajczak said parts of the southeast stumbled a bit when 
manufacturing was stumbling but there was enough strength in the 
cities with the movement towards the services that overcame all the 
mill towns shutting down 
although the southeast has been in the lead dris ms johnson 
says it will slip into second behind the pacific southwest as 
employment and population gains slow and defense cutbacks are felt 
in several states 
the pacific regions have capitalized on the export boom and 
will continue to do so she said the economy is 
welldiversified with a nice mix of high tech finance and 
services population continues to drift toward that region 
the midwest meanwhile may be starting a comeback says 
prudentialbaches yardeni 
one of the buzzwords of the 1980s was the rust bowl the 
deindustrialization of america and this was focused on the 
midwest yardeni said as it turned out these forecasts of the 
death of american industry were unwarranted it did restructure 
did cut some excess capacity and by 1987 it was clear that we were 
coming out of the midcycle industrial recession very nicely 
meanwhile the prospects for agriculture have improved helped 
partly by the recent political changes in the communist bloc 
look at all the russians and east europeans were going to 
have to feed yardeni said

consumers bingedin the 1980s indulging 
themselves with everything from fancy gourmet foods to electronic 
gadgets and luxury vacations 
now on the cusp of a new decade consumers bloated with debt 
are sobering up 
the us marketplace bore the full weight of the postwar baby 
boom during the 80s many grownup boomers ignored the example set 
by thrifty parents and spent liberally helping to fuel the longest 
peacetime economic expansion in american history 
they were helped in their pursuit of consumer happiness by some 
fortuitous economic events 
inflation was tamed in the early part of the decade by the 
federal reserves tight money policies and the prime lending rate 
which had peaked at 215 percent in december 1980 fell closer to 
10 percent by late 1982 
a big income tax cut was engineered by president reagan a bull 
market on wall street kicked up piles of money for lucky investors 
a strong dollar made imported goods like japanese electronics and 
german automobiles the standards by which all good consuming 
americans were measured 
people went shopping like crazy we were on a spending binge 
in the 1980s said sandra shaber an economist with the futures 
group in washington for most of the decade americans were spared 
the pair of miseries that plagued the 1970s and early 80s rampant 
food and fuel inflation 
advertising jingles proclaiming you deserve a break today or 
asking cheekily who says you cant have it all summarized the 
spendthrift mentality of yuppies the buzzword for young urban 
professionals 
they were not into postponed gratification said 
floridabased consultant carol farmer 
yuppies embodied 80sstyle conspicuous consumption although 
representing less than an estimated 5 percent of the 76 million 
americans born between 1946 and 64 they were the vanguard of the 
babyboom generation setting trends in consumer behavior 
more consumers than ever before were armed with credit cards and 
carried the buynow paylater concept to the limit 
over 606 million charge cards of all kinds including ones 
offered by retailers were held by americans at the end of 1988 up 
from 380 million in 1979 according to figures compiled by the 
bankcard holders of america a nonprofit group 
leo j shapiro whose chicagobased market research firm tracks 
trends said shopping habits changed drastically during the decade 
dualincome families had no room for chief shoppers whose main 
mission in life is keeping cupboards from going bare and keeping 
house 
the result was more individuals shopping for themselves giving 
rise to specialty retailers each supplying specific types of 
merchandise these niche merchants are expected to thrive in the 
90s shapiro said 
trend spotter faith popcorn of the marketing consulting firm 
brain reserve inc said consumers seemed obsessed with props during 
the 80s things that made them look good or helped project a 
certain image 
the principal consequence of all this spending was an 
accumulation of debt and an accompanying decline in savings 
the savings rate measured as a percentage of spendable personal 
income sank to some unusually low depths in the 80s 32 percent 
in 1987 compared with an average between 65 percent and 7 percent 
in the three prior decades 
the economy in general looks a lot different than it did when 
the boom began the tax cut left behind a big budget deficit the 
flood of imports threw the trade balance out of whack inflation 
spurred along by aggressive spending poses a new threat 
against the backdrop of impending hard times consumer tastes 
are beginning to change shifting away from extravagance toward 
practicality the experts believe 
furniture not fast cars and home computers not glitzy 
trinkets will be the peoples choice of the 90s with a larger 
share of babyboomers coping with the responsibility and expense of 
child rearing purchases will be more sensible predicts ms 
popcorn the marketing consultant 
the 1980s were for show and the 1990s are for go in terms of 
where is it going to get me in the future ms popcorn said 
shapiro thinks of it as a shift away from abundance toward the 
precious which he describes as an intense enjoyment of the 
things you have rather than simple gluttony 
even if belts are tightened a few notches consumers will remain 
a driving force of economic activity but their power may be 
channeled in different directions or diminished as the economy 
matures and sorts out imbalances particularly in foreign trade 
in the 1980s we were consuming more than we produced at 
home ms shaber said final demand in the united states was 
greater than domestic production to close the gap we have to do 
the reverse

the tracker is one of those vehicles that could 
have existed only in the 1980s designed in japan built in canada 
by a usjapanese partnership and sold in the united states 
did that make it japanese canadian or maybe american since it 
was sold in chevrolet showrooms its producers avoided the issue by 
calling it a geo from the greek word for earth 
for the us auto industry it was a confusing sometimes 
difficult and above all blurry decade 
blurriest were the definitions of what was an imported car 
scenes of angry men battering a toyota with sledgehammers faded 
into scenes of happy japanese and american autoworkers toiling 
together on assembly plant teams 
people werent even sure what it was the companies were making 
the nissan pathfinder was classified as a car by the treasury 
department and a truck by the transportation department 
as for attitudes toward the japanese just ask bob mccurry 
executive vice president of toyota motor sales usa inc 
most of the prejudices have gone away he said but i 
still have some relatives where they havent 
the auto industry was touched like many others by 
acquisitions joint ventures and takeovers as in other industries 
the japanese influence shifted into high gear 
proud american automakers industrial pillars of the west 
struggled to halt their loss of market share to competitors from 
across the pacific by forming joint ventures with japanese 
companies and imitating japans manufacturing and labor management 
the tracker typifies the partnership trend the small 
sportutility vehicle was designed by suzuki motor co ltd of 
japan its built in canada at a factory owned by suzuki and 
general motors corp its sold through us chevrolet dealers and 
carries the geo nameplate 
for another example a mazda motor corp plant in flat rock 
mich produces cars for ford motor co 
the japanese certainly have provided a goad and it has been a 
chance for us to learn some very good things that we have learned 
to apply ford chairman donald petersen said in a recent 
interview 
each of the big three battled back to profitability during the 
decade through new products costcutting union concessions and 
government protection from imports 
chryslers case was the most widely publicized in 1980 the 
federal government guaranteed loans to refloat the sinking 
automaker the corporation paid off the loans seven years early 
we began the decade of the 80s by taking one risk that ran 
against some of the most deeply ingrained economic ideals we hold 
in this country and it was a huge success chrysler chairman lee 
iacocca said in a recent speech 
ford lost 154 billion in 1980 but it turned into the most 
profitable automaker in history just eight years later when it 
reported a 53 billion profit gm began an action plan that 
has a target of trimming 13 billion from its costs 
instead of reinvesting all their profits the big three hedged 
their bets by going into other businesses 
general motors corp acquired electronic data systems inc in 
october 1984 and hughes electronics inc in june 1985 
ford got into the banking business in december 1985 when it 
acquired san franciscobased first nationwide bank which has 
become the nations secondlargest savings and loan institution 
chrysler corp bought gulfstream aerospace in august 1985 two 
years before it purchased american motors corp 
chrysler for one later decided it was spreading itself too 
thin late in 1989 it announced plans to sell gulfstream aerospace 
and its military electronics business to concentrate resources on 
core car and truck operations 
another ploy of the automakers had an unintended side effect 
the big three managed to obtain voluntary restraints on 
japanese imports but that only drove the japanese into building 
plants in the united states those plants made cars even more 
cheaply than the ones in japan 
honda motor co ltd spearheaded the japanese manufacturing 
assault on american soil when it began making civics in marysville 
ohio in november 1982 since then nissan toyota mazda 
mitsubishi subaru isuzu and hyundai have set up assembly plants 
either independently or in a joint venture with one of the big 
three automakers 
those plants are adding to big problems for the industry as the 
1990s get under way overcapacity and the potential for layoffs 
the overcapacity that emerged in the 1980s seems certain to 
worsen in the 1990s the plants forced to close most likely wont 
be the new japaneseowned ones in whitedominated 
righttowork places like rural tennessee and kentucky theyll 
be the aging big three plants mostly located in union strongholds 
and employing a disproportionate share of minority workers 
under pressure from japan membership in the united auto workers 
union dropped during the decade from about 15 million to just 
under 1 million 
while many things got blurry in the 1980s the outlook for 
oldline autoworkers became starkly clear

the number of working us oil and gas rigs 
declined slightly this week dropping by four to a total of 1058 
this weeks decline follows a 25rig increase that boosted the 
count last week to 1062 that increase had reversed a twoweek 
decline 
the latest rig count compiled by baker hughes inc and reported 
monday is 136 ahead of a year ago 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oil producing states louisiana gained seven rigs 
texas was up by three oklahoma and north dakota each gained two 
and californias count increased by one 
colorado lost seven rigs new mexico was down by four wyoming 
lost three and kansass count declined by two the rig totals in 
ohio michigan and pennsylvania were unchanged

for a lesson in how the investment picture 
changed in 1980s ask the hunt brothers of texas 
the former billionaires who made a fortune in oil tried to 
cash in on the meteoric rise of silver and other precious metals of 
the inflationary 70s and wound up losing their rolex watches as 
the 80s rolled in and silver prices tumbled 
there was a lot of pessimism around when carter was president 
and the soviet union was invading afghanistan noted edward 
yardeni chief economist for prudentialbache securities inc as 
the decade progressed i was much more optimistic 
political instability heavy government regulation and high 
taxes and inflation almost household words in the 70s 
disappeared these past 10 years the nation embarked on the longest 
peactime economic expansion ever 
financial assets such as stocks bonds or treasury bills 
flourished socalled tangible or real assets including 
silver gold oil or farmland gave up some of their gains of the 
previous decade although noted exceptions were in some artwork and 
collectibles 
a recent study by the new york securities firm salomon brothers 
inc found that stocks averaged a 17 percent return during the 80s 
about twice the historical norm making them the no 1 
investment performers despite the 1987 stock market crash 
coins came in second with a 129 percent return followed by 
bonds 109 percent and treasury bills 10 percent 
in the cellar were silver with a 46 percent loss and 
farmland which lost 05 percent the study said other poor 
performers were foreign exchange investments which gained less 
than 1 percent due largely to the dollars volatility oil which 
gained 12 percent and gold 28 percent 
by comparison the inflation rate averaged 57 percent during the 
decade 
many experts believe stocks and bonds will continue to perform 
well in the early 1990s but as yardeni warns anytime you have 
such extraordinary returns in an asset in a 10year period its 
time to think of something else 
some experts see potential investment opportunities in europe 
particularly among easternbloc countries where rapid political 
and economic reforms are occurring others say regional real 
estate which bottomed out in areas like texas or the rockies is 
destined for a turnaround 
still for tom ohara who invests as a hobby the bull stock 
market has been a boon for his mutual investment club of detroit 
which he helped start with friends five decades ago from 1980 to 
now has been fabulous he said the clubs portfolio which 
includes a variety of stocks grew threefold in the 1980s to a high 
of 2 million by contrast the clubs porfolio rose by 41 percent 
in all of the previous decade 
michael stein a financial planner with brownson rehmus amp 
foxworth in chicago said clients who came out on top in the 80s 
undoubtedly were enrolled in a company stock ownership plan 
but diversification also was the key in dealing with financial 
assets stein said 
not all stock funds performed well those who took the 
conservative approach sticking with typical passbook savings 
accounts or certificates of deposits didnt do well when interest 
rates were low generally in the mid1980s when stock prices 
crashed however the safety offered by fixedincome products was a 
blessing for many 
also it made a difference how actively you traded your 
portfolio stein said those who held onto the same portfolio 
with virtually no changes probably ended up with a greater return 
than those who made changes and had to pay brokerage fees and 
commissions and taxes 
investors were preoccupied with taxes during the 70s and early 
80s and investments designed to shelter more income from uncle 
sam were popular until tax laws were reformed late in the decade 
a lot of the money in the early 80s went to taxmotivated 
ventures said jay goldinger who runs the beverly hills calif 
investment firm capital insight inc i remember driving down the 
coast of california and seeing all these windmills there used to 
be tax benefits for energy conservation 
perhaps one of the more notable changes in the 80s was that 
americans became more wallsteet wise partly because many families 
had more discretionary income to invest 
women began to really move in droves into the work force 
said hank madden a financial planner in the jacksonville fla 
office of ids financial services inc a lot of lowerincome 
families were elevated to middleclass families

the money decade of the 1980s brought both heady 
success and egregious excess to wall street 
the securities markets returned the favor by taking a hand in 
setting the economic and political course of the decade for 
american society 
stock traders celebrated the ascendance of deregulation 
technology and global investing with a historic bull market that 
began in the summer of 1982 and reached new highs as late as the 
autumn of 1989 
it has been a very unusual bull market the longest we have 
ever had in peacetime said raymond f devoe jr a veteran 
analyst at the firm of legg mason wood walker inc 
it outlasted several prominent participants who by the end of 
the decade were serving prison terms or banished from the business 
for their parts in a series of scandals 
in the ultimate test of its staying power the bull market 
survived the worst market drop in more than half a century the 
crash of 1987 that culminated in black monday on oct 19 of that 
year 
wall street in the 80s was unfailingly controversial as well 
while the bull market signaled a sevenyear period of economic 
expansion that was welcomed by many business managers and 
consumers it was assailed by social critics as the emblem of an 
age of materialism 
many wall streeters themselves decried the new computerized 
trading techniques it helped spawn strategies like index 
arbitrage and portfolio insurance that collectively came under the 
label program trading 
worst of all said some the boom on wall street was financed in 
large part by a mountain of debt that might someday collapse with 
devastating consequences 
still with all their blemishes the 1980s lived up to their 
billing on the street as the decade of financial assets 
gone were the bouts of rapid inflation and rapidly rising 
interest rates that depressed paper investments in the 1970s 
elevating in their place tangible assets such as gold and 
collectibles 
stocks and bonds were back in favor as a way to participate in 
the growth and resilience of the american economy 
as they recovered their strength the stock and bond markets 
flexed their muscles playing a newly prominent role in the shaping 
of government policies affecting the economy 
at the beginning of the 1980s it was the bond markets turn to 
play vigilante acting as a kind of selfappointed surrogate 
for the federal reserve by increasing interest rates each time its 
traders sensed a new stirring of inflation 
by the time of the 1987 crash the stock market also had emerged 
as a vigilante force impelling central bankers to ease up on 
credit conditions whenever it felt the threat of recession 
the new breed of financial vigilante was quick to strike 
sending the dow jones average of 30 industrials down a record 508 
points on black monday in 1987 and administering another 190point 
beating nearly two years later on oct 13 1989 
despite those rude interruptions the net results for the decade 
showed emphatic advances the dow jones industrials which started 
the 1980s at 83874 hovered near 2700 in the waning weeks of the 
decade 
that kind of performance wont be easy to match in the 1990s 
for the average to triple again it would have to climb past 8000 
some observers see reason to hope for more good news the 
nations labor force is likely to grow more slowly in the 1990s 
putting pressure on business to invest in greater amounts of 
productivityenhancing equipment says richard peterson chief 
economist at chicagos continental bank 
the net effect of increasing investment in business equipment 
will be a pattern of steady economic expansion through the 1990s 
peterson asserts 
nevertheless many analysts wonder whether more unpleasant 
shocks await a generation that grew up with the image of wall 
street as inexhaustible horn of plenty 
as devoe put it an awful lot of people are being seduced to 
the idea that were never going to have another bear market again

john diebold was in paris in the late 1950s 
talking about computers when a russian stood up in the back of the 
room and said computers were exactly what his country needed 
large computers would finally enable soviet leaders to control 
their economy according to plan the russian said 
dont be so sure diebold told the man computers can do a lot 
but they cant run an entire economy nothing can things are too 
complex 
that meeting in paris more than 30 years ago foreshadowed two of 
the most powerful developments of the 1980s the rise of the 
personal computer and the decline of centrally planned economies 
western democracies prospered in the 80s because power was in 
the hands of the people personal computers helped by breaking the 
tyranny of the corporate data center where men in white coats had 
doled out information to supplicants 
moscows commissars feared personal computers as much as 
printing presses their central computers were busy churning out 
fiveyear plans it didnt work for producing steel and it worked 
even less for producing ideas the currency of the knowledge 
economy that emerged in the 80s 
they always thought that if they just got one more level of 
sophistication in their equations and in their models that would 
make the whole thing work it didnt said diebold a new 
yorkbased consultant 
apple computer inc recognized the personal computers 
revolutionary potential in a january 1984 commercial of a female 
athlete throwing a mallet through an image of big brother 
in the flash of the exploding screen apple announced the 
macintosh and promised youll see why 1984 wont be like 
1984 
the personal computer was a phenomenon of the 1980s 
while the pple ii appeared in 1977 pcs didnt become a force in 
the business world until ibm rolled out its first model in 1981 
after that things happened quickly 
in 1982 lotus development corp introduced 123 the 
electronic spreadsheet that gave many people a reason to buy their 
first computer compaq computer corp introduced its first ibm 
clone that year and rose to the fortune 500 faster than any 
company in history 
1984 was the year of the macintosh as well as the first personal 
computers from newly splitup atampt in 1985 cofounder steve jobs 
resigned from apple in 1987 ibm tried to distance itself from the 
clonemakers with its personal system2 line in 1989 jobs 
introduced a black magnesium cube of a workstation that he called 
the next 
pcs were the great levelers in the 80s they let little guys 
compete for business with big guys owners of pcs could dig facts 
out of databases analyze them and assemble them into 
professionallooking documents all from a storefront office or a 
corner of the bedroom 
the leveling happened within the computer industry itself 
for ibm pcs threatened the fat profit margins it made on 
minicomputers and mainframes 
american telephone amp telegraph co found that all the resources 
of bell laboratories could not guarantee it success in the 
fastmoving pc industry in 1989 it ran ads portraying itself as a 
david to the goliath of compaq a company not even founded a 
decade earlier 
the united states invented personal computers and used them in 
the 80s more than any other nation perhaps a reflection of the 
goitalone spirit of americans 
americans dominated production of pcs as well but that may not 
last for long japan gained control of most chips screens and 
other components and attained a solid position in laptop computers 
the fastestgrowing portion of the market 
whether or not japan takes over the pc industry in the 90s the 
critical issue will be which company and which nation uses 
computers most intelligently 
the wrong way is mindless numbercrunching which was all too 
common in the 80s 
you got a lot of people showing very elegant sets of figures 
all worked out in great plans but with the same sorts of lack of 
judgment you would have had without the computer said diebold 
to change that personal computers in the 90s must be machines 
for ideas argues marsh fisher an entrepreneur in irvine calif 
society must learn to raise ideas as methodically as it raises 
wheat fisher argues he has sold walt disney co and others on a 
program called ideafisher that prods people into making odd but 
fruitful mental associations 
the computers been crunching numbers and wordprocessing very 
neatly for a lot of years fisher said now weve got to move 
it into expanding our mind 
that agenda is a natural for the americanborn personal 
computer it is definitely not what the russian in paris had in 
mind

product makers in the 1980s let people have what 
they wanted even if it meant admitting a mistake 
the revival of old coke by popular demand told the story of the 
decade consumers were masters of the economic universe and they 
got exactly what they desired from fax machines to oat bran 
convenience and specialization were hallmarks of 80s products 
microwave ovens had been available before the decade started 
but their popularity zoomed in the 80s as lower prices and more 
compact construction helped make them indispensable fixtures in 
american kitchens 
judith langer who heads her own new yorkbased market research 
firm said the machine eased the guilt some homemakers felt about 
pursuing interests outside the home the kids could easily fix 
their own hot meals 
cocacola co upset some customers by changing the formula for 
its flagship drink in 1985 the company said it listened to 
consumer complaints and brought back the original as cocacola 
classic three months later the old standby soon regained status as 
the bestselling soft drink leaving analysts to wonder whether it 
was all a publicity stunt 
while the microwave oven made it easier to leave home the 1980s 
offered other products for those who didnt necessarily want to go 
to the office 
from the timex sinclair 1000 personal computer that debuted in 
the early part of the decade through generations of ibm and apple 
models and the compaq laptop people had the tools to keep up and 
figure things out for themselves at home 
the trend toward selfsufficiency was accelerated with the 
proliferation of cellular telephones and personal facsimile 
machines 
well over half of american homes installed videocassette 
recorders giving people the freedom to do what they wanted and 
still catch their favorite movies or programs on their terms 
forget to set the timer you can tune in the portable sony watchman 
tv 
gannett co inc launched its national newspaper usa today in 
the 1980s and its colorful graphics and concise writing style 
influenced other papers 
in television the mass media came under assault as cable 
networks emerged and others went after narrow audiences rock music 
fans got their mtv and the financial news network was launched 
home shopping channels also debuted peddling jewelry porcelain 
dolls and gadgets around the clock 
dozens of new financial products appeared in the 1980s 
including zerocoupon bonds securities backed by payments on car 
loans bank money market accounts and futures trading based on 
stock indexes 
on the highways chrysler corp introduced minivans cars like 
chevy camaro and pontiac firebird livened up the dowdy state of 
auto design and convertibles made a comback but the gullwinged 
delorean failed to fly except in the movies and the yugo from 
eastern europe quickly ran out of gas 
california coolers started a rush to concocting alcoholic 
beverages for the adults who grew up on fizzy drinks but the rage 
soon went flat anheuserbusch cos introduced la a lowalcohol 
beer that has lagged despite the trend toward moderation and health 
the health craze created the environment for 100 sneakers from 
nike and reebok and a revival of demand for oatmeal with its 
reputed cholesterollowering abilities 
if the 1980s left you stressed you could take some consolation 
from another product of the decade the pain reliever ibuprofen 
was approved for sale without prescription

jobs 
of the scores who played leading roles in business and finance 
during the decade these are eight who shaped the 80s 
when asked to name the great business leaders of the decade 
associated press business writers produced a list of more than 30 
including some inanimate objects like the junk bond and one obvious 
group the japanese 
but some individuals stood out their contributions so familiar 
that the mere mention of their last names nearly tells their 
stories 
these are eight who set the tone eight who personify the most 
important themes of the last 10 years free markets corporate 
restructuring economic transformation and global competitiveness 
two of the eight former president reagan and exfederal reserve 
chairman paul volcker orchestrated events at the macroeconomic 
level molding an economy of steady growth and low inflation 
michael milken t boone pickens and frank lorenzo exploited the 
times blazing trails and building fortunes in reagans unfettered 
marketplace 
lee iacocca and akio morita performed business miracles on 
opposite ends of the earth and emerged as national as well as 
corporate standardbearers 
steve jobs as a singular sensation proved a reassuring 
reminder that no matter how much change the 1980s wrought 
individual creativity was still the most valuable commodity for 
sale in america 
below are brief reflections on the marks these eight left behind

reagan was dubbed the great communicator but he was an even 
greater deregulator and free enterpriser who dedicated his 
twoterm presidency to restoring americas capitalist fervor 
he will be remembered for his good fortune he got a recession 
out of the way at the beginning of his tenure and for maximizing 
his opportunities in the midst of the downturn he won approval 
for big tax cuts that launched the longest peacetime expansion in 
us history 
he held two economic tenets dear taxes should be cut and the 
federal bureaucracy should be trimmed because he proved a better 
tax cutter than program pruner the reagan boom created a 
burgeoning federal budget deficit that kept interest rates 
inordinately high even as the economy expanded 
plugging the holes in reaganomics fell to volcker who 
controlled the money supply and thus interest rates with the 
perspective of a tortoise to reagans hare 
where all the presidents men saw growth the apostate volcker 
smelled inflation and resolved to keep a grip on monetary policy 
even as reaganites jawboned for easier credit 
for his steadfastness the fed chairman earned the unofficial 
title of second most powerful man in america oddly volcker 
was never seen as a political threat to the president perhaps 
because his tightmoney policies kept the worst excesses of the 
reagan revolution in check 
reagans appeal was founded in his bold pursuit of ideals at the 
expense of opposing interests executives admired his guts when he 
fired the striking air controllers in 1981 labor leaders never 
forgave him 
volcker too was somewhat of an idealist but he had bitter 
medicine for all to swallow consumers and fat cats alike 
volcker put restrictions on business in the form of tight 
credit reagan dismantled government regulation at every turn 
reagan invited all businesses to the party volcker and his 
inflationfighting successor alan greenspan were the designated 
drivers 
putting an ironic twist on an old donald regan saw reagan could 
not have been reagan if volcker hadnt been volcker the 
expansion still intact after seven years would not have been as 
powerful or as enduring without the countervailing forces of 
reagans whip and volckers tug on the reins 
</TEXT>

by reviving laissez faire as a guiding principle of government 
reagan set the stage for a new brand of capitalist in 1980s 
government scrutiny was out wheeling and dealing was in 
milken pickens and lorenzo became giants not by inheritance or 
formal succession to the chief executives office but by taking 
full advantage of the markets new freedoms 
they didnt develop any new products they employed old tools to 
new ends 
milken a bond trader took highrisk corporate bonds off the 
junk heap and created a 200 billion market for debt financing 
pickens an oilman showed how to hit gushers in the stock 
market by snapping up the shares of companies undervalued in 
comparison to their assets 
lorenzo a harvard mba with a fascination for flying assembled 
the nations biggest airline empire under the banner of texas air 
by buying up deregulated carriers and busting unions 
sympathetic biographers would label all three selfmade me but 
they were not the sort of cuddly entrepreneurs americans 
instinctively embrace indeed their greatest successes prompted 
more cocked eyebrows than applause 
milken was indicted for securities fraud pickens was branded a 
raider lorenzo after flying two airlines into bankruptcy and 
putting hundreds of union employees out of work became known as 
one of americas toughest bosses 
as three of the greatest risktakers of the age each was 
stalked as much as he hunted his own prey but they were 
characteristically unbowed by challenge or criticism 
lorenzo a recent magazine profile noted survived on the 
conviction of his own rightness so milken in the face of his 1990 
trial so pickens in his raids most recently on a japanese 
company 
lorenzos comment when he bought eastern airlines in 1986 was 
typical of the threesomes sober acceptance of controversy 
there aint no santa claus he told a news conference

iacocca and morita were tough guys with a better press they 
attracted enemies but managed their images with aplomb as a 
result they became instant national symbols 
the chrysler corp chairman got a billiondollar bailout from 
the federal government as the decade opened but paid the debt in 
1983 seven years ahead of schedule to flaunt the extraordinary 
payback he held a lavish press conference where he stood before a 
mammoth blowup of a check for 800 million the companys final 
payment 
his success at chrysler after being fired from ford motor co 
in 1978 was as much a personal victory as a corporate one he 
personally sold congress on the bailout and became the companys 
main pitchman for kcars and minivans in national television 
commercials 
exposure was his magic wand when he was fired from the statue 
of liberty restoration committee in a political snit in 1986 he 
wrapped himself in the flag and called the ouster unamerican 
most iacocca fans agreed 
morita the sony corp chairman became the japanese answer to 
iacocca but with an even tougher pr challenge besides selling 
himself and his company he had to sell a whole nation of 
aggressive capitalists to skeptical americans 
a natural salesman and communicator in the iacocca mold morita 
seemed to sense what was needed to salve old postwar sores 
after sony bought cbs records in 1987 he hugged recording star 
cyndi lauper for a magazine cover photo symbolically embracing the 
culture when sony bought columbia pictures this fall he paid 
millions to get the services of a pair of american producers peter 
guber and jon peters creators of hits batman and rain man 
and of course sony kept churning out gizmos for american 
consumers who could hate a guy bringing a video walkman to market 
just in time for christmas 
morita was no softy he frequently criticized shortterm 
thinking in the united states and cowrote a book discussing the 
decline of america but when the book provoked a backlash in 
congress he apologized for promoting nationalistic views 
the secret to the success of stars like morita and iacocca was 
their political sensitivity and their mastery of the media few 
business leaders of the age stood as tall outside the boardroom or 
the plant

one man combined popular allure with real genius steve jobs he 
was the american dream updated to the 80s the garage inventor who 
struck it rich a thirtysomething horatio alger 
in a sense jobs was the consummate business leader of the 
decade he was young he invented computers the machine of the 
age he walked away from a very successful company just to start 
another one 
he built the apple computer inc empire only to leave it in 1985 
after introducing one of the hottest computer boxes of the decade 
the macintosh jobs left the company in a dispute with john 
sculley a veteran businessman whom jobs himself had recruited to 
help run his growing firm 
what mattered most to jobs was not running a company but 
creating hot boxes his subsequent creation the product of a few 
wizards work was appropriately labeled next 
his trademark long hair sometimes gave way to a yuppie trim and 
he seemed to enjoy the panache of bow ties and designer suits as 
much as his faded blue jeans but there was no mistaking what he 
represented 
as the rebellious youth beating the old capitalist establishment 
at its own game jobs provided a fitting symbol for a decade that 
followed the 70s

larry kilcoin a victim of the farm 
depression of the 1980s says losing his farm and seeing someone 
else work the land was like watching someone else live with your 
wife 
it was oct 19 1987 a day known as black monday on wall 
street half a continent away that kilcoin signed the deed of his 
farm over to the federal land bank some of that land had been in 
his family for three generations 
the 440acre corn cattle and hog operation in the rolling hills 
of west central iowa not far from the spot where jesse james is 
reputed to have staged the first train robbery in the west became 
another statistic in a faltering agricultural economy 
the land is kind of attached to you its kind of like losing 
your arm said kilcoin 
his wife jackie interrupted saying no its more like 
losing your heart 
kilcoin and his wife say that after 20 straight years of making 
payments they failed to meet a 35000 annual mortgage installment 
in 1985 because new management at a local bank refused to continue 
a longstanding operating loan arrangement 
we thought we had the operating money for the year put 
together a couple of weeks before we needed it we found we didnt 
have it he said 
kilcoin says it was a shift in inflation policy and resulting 
high interest rates that did him in 
in the 1970s it was a common belief that inflation always 
would be with us said neil harl an iowa state university 
professor and expert on agricultural economics 
inflationary expectations drove farmland values sky high which 
boosted the borrowing power of farmers who used that asset as 
collateral for loans 
but the federal reserves move to fight inflation with tighter 
credit in 1979 drove interest rates to record heights and sent land 
values tumbling at the same time a rising dollar made us grain 
and meat more expensive in foreign markets cutting into farmers 
traditional export earnings 
drought hit in 1983 and kilcoin says he never did catch up 
net cash farm income in iowa the difference between cash 
earnings and cash expenses and a gauge of the money available to 
repay debts or invest in operations or savings sank from about 
27 billion in 1981 to around 16 billion in 1984 
farmland values in iowa plummeted 71 percent from 1980 to 1987 
after adjusting for inflation according to the federal reserve 
bank of chicago a plunge even steeper than the 61 percent 
inflationadjusted slump of 19161942 the slide eroded the 
security backing up loans held by the kilcoins and others 
we had a profit but interest rates ate up all profits and we 
had to borrow money just to pay the interest rates kilcoin said 
in a discussion at the table in a kitchen that has a 20yearold 
stove a used refrigerator and a dishwasher bought for 6 in a 
garage sale in the 1970s it wasnt that we werent making money 
we werent making enough money 
now 51 kilcoin has learned a new trade making engine bearings 
he has become a commuter who has time for his children only on 
weekends and goes to community college one day a week 
i still walk though the door at work and the door shuts 
behind me and i think is this really me 
hes far from alone in his plight despite the rebound in the 
agricultural economy as the decade ended with iowa net cash farm 
income shooting up to nearly 39 billion in 1987 and then settling 
to 34 billion last year 
the people i work with are the same people either they are 
my age farmed and lost or young people who wished they could farm 
but cant kilcoin said 
his wife 49 works at home assembling small parts for car and 
truck chassis for the illinois tool works earning about 200 a 
week enough to meet payments on a used minivan and buy the 
groceries 
but before those jobs materialized it was touch and go for the 
family with three married daughters and a 13yearold girl and 
6yearold boy at home 
for two years the couple did not know if they would keep their 
home and larry says he told his wife he was ready to leave the 
united states if he lost the house 
but the kilcoins negotiated to buy back the home and 13 acres 
that surround it 
they refused to declare bankruptcy and jackie kilcoin says we 
will be paying the rest of our lives on our debt 
butnow things are more settled 
i dont have to worry about the phone ringing any more i 
dont have to be afraid of going to the mailbox mrs kilcoin 
said 
the couple still keeps a hand in farming too they fatten about 
600 hogs for market under contract for a chicago feedlot they also 
own 18 head of cattle 
kilcoin still has worries including fears for his country 
which he sees overburdened by debt just as farmers were at the 
start of the decade 
that puts them in the position i was he said who shuts 
down the government

they wrote the book on business in the 1980s 
over and over and over until it seemed there were fewer 
executives than authors telling them how to succeed 
choose your approach management by walking around the flat 
organization quality circles actually a holdover from the 1970s 
zero defects how soft management skills create hard 
business results 
how to give good phone was an offering from lisa collier 
cool ed mcmahons superselling a tome by the carson sidekick 
and alpo pitchman 
the scene for all this was set in 1982 by thomas j peters and 
robert h waterman jrs in search of excellence which proved 
that critically wellreceived management books can also be 
moneymakers 
then came iacocca followed by a string of bestsellers in 
the mid80s megatrends the one minute manager what 
they dont teach you at the harvard business school 
those three books sold between 500000 and 15 million copies 
each which was unheard of said business book editor harriet 
rubin 
the floodgates opened 
publishing is definitely a followtheleader business and 
when something works they jump on the bandwagon said jim miliot 
editor of the bp report a publishing newsletter in white plains 
ny 
intrapreneuring thriving on chaos you are the 
message corporate cultures leadership secrets of attila 
the hun 
miliot said the books fit right in during the 80s with 
reagan the businessisgreat attitude and free enterprise at its 
best 
but were they worth reading 
most of these books are shallow insipid and stupid said 
peter f drucker the longtime business consultant and writer 
called the dr spock for generations of american business 
managers by business week 
everyone was trying to emulate tom peters drucker 80 the 
author of 24 books said in a telephone interview from his home in 
claremont calif 
ms rubin the book editor agrees most of the books are dull 
and theyre badly written 
people were buying them but they sort of used them as 
intellectual wallpaper or on the desk as a placebo she said 
but unlike drucker she thinks theres a market for yet more 
business books in the 1990s 
in fact doubleday has hired her as executive editor of a whole 
new line doubledaycurrency books advertised as being dedicated to 
business thinkers not just doers who rebel against the 
status quo 
who today can start a fire in our minds ms rubin writes in 
publicity material for the books 
the iacoccas succeeded in the old world of hierarchy 
authority and control which has less relevance today 
according to ms rubin the new hot button is no longer 
entrepreneur or executive but change agent that 
revolutionary is our ideal reader 
business people would buy in search of excellence thriving 
on chaos and leadership secrets of attila the hun ms rubin 
said in a telephone interview from new york 
but the books they would actually read were in the 
sciences philosophy pop culture she said they were trying 
to make sense of complex lives 
the flagship publication of the new line is leadership is an 
art by max depree chief executive of the herman miller co 
furniture makers out this fall and already in its fifth printing 
with 65000 copies in print 
its the opposite of confessions of an sob or 
leadership secrets of attila the hun said doubleday 
spokeswoman jacqueline deval 
his leadership principles are based on a concern for the 
health and welfare of the people working for you ms deval said 
and not just for the sake of being kinder or gentler but for 
overall profitability as well the bottom line 
drucker the dean of the management gurus likes deprees book 
but hopes the businessbook fad as a whole gets laid to rest 
the boom is over i hope drucker said glumly but ive 
been saying that for two years now and ive been wrong so far

to those who received mbas in 1981 wall street 
beckoned like a sirens song 
although a recession gripped the nation the securities industry 
and investment banks were on their way to reshaping american 
businesses and they were hiring legions of fresh mbas to do the 
job 
takeovers restructurings and stock and bond offerings became 
fortunemaking vehicles for an army of young people tales of 
23yearolds with 300000 salaries plus bonuses abounded and lured 
flocks of people to the nations business schools 
but what a difference a decade makes 
these days new yorks financial district is quiet and 
depressed tens of thousands of people were let go following the 
oct 19 1987 market collapse the stock markets unsettling 
volatility this fall has hurt new hiring plans 
no new people are coming into the securities industry said 
susan perkins an 81 new york university mba grad and vice 
president at the investment research boutique of gerard klauer 
mattison amp co 
lucrative fees from megadeals withered this year as the dollar 
volume of takeovers slumped 28 percent from 1988s heady pace 
according to securities data corp investment houses have scaled 
back commissions and shut entire departments to save money some 
estimate bonuses will be trimmed by as much as 30 percent this year 
the big salaries that deal people commanded during 80s were 
clearly out of line and they still are said randall rochman a 
vice president at goldman sachs amp co in chicago and 1981 mba 
graduate of northwestern universitys kellogg school 
starting salaries for mbas doubled over the course of the 
decade nyus stern school said the average salary for grads 
entering all facets of business was 26936 in 1981 the average 
broke the 50000 mark this year 
the cost of getting the degree has nearly tripled at some 
schools harvard university is charging 30700 for the twoyear 
mba course that cost 9600 in 1981 
a recent nyu survey shows male 1979 mba grads are averaging 
122600 a year while their female classmates are making 87200 on 
average and the respondents 143 of out of 665 alumni polled 
have averaged three promotions since leaving nyu 
but for those hitting the pavement in 1991 the degree that once 
opened doors could become an impediment at some job interviews 
some speculate that with scrutiny of the bottom line employers may 
not readily embrace the highpriced grad clutching a masters of 
business administration degree 
people think the mba is a ticket to a higher life said 
scott corwin 31 chief operating officer at the princeton nj 
consulting firm caliper management inc 
sure they are averaging higher salaries but in the end it 
comes down to what an individual makes of an opportunity said 
corwin an 81 nyu grad 
as wall street loses its allure more grads are seeking to work 
for americas corporations and companies are carving out a greater 
presence on campuses recruiting students 
kim avison 24 expects to put in 60hour weeks in sales or 
marketing for a major consumer products corporation when she 
graduates in 1991 from dartmouth universitys amos tuck school of 
business 
at columbia university mba candidate tim newman 25 said he 
wouldnt be surprised if the nation slips into a recession shortly 
after he graduates but he says those who develop highly specific 
skills will fare well 
newman hopes to become involved in investment management for a 
university or charity endowment when he graduates in 1991 a far 
cry from investment banking 
if the business climate sours in the coming decade as many 
believe it will the class of 91 may not have been taught as we 
werent how to deal with it calipers corwin said 
he credits the hard economic times of the early 80s for 
teaching him more about running a business than business school 
ever did its much easier to manage when theres growth said 
corwin who noted that his consulting firm lost a third of its 
business between 1981 and 1982 
current students say money is not their primary concern if 
you work hard the money will come avison said 
but one recent ivy league grad countered that making money is 
an essential consideration particularly for those attending 
expensive private schools 
still financial rewards come at a high price long hours 
broken marriages and a distorted sense of values typified business 
of the 80s 
i have seen what is probably a higher incidence of divorce in 
our industry i suspect because people are trying to reach for the 
brass ring rochman said 
the spirit of reagans presidency was one of handsoff 
unfettered pursuit of wealth even greed said richard fisher 
37 a vice president at cs first boston though he believes the 
nation is begining to focus on more social concerns 
if there is one axiom that holds true it is in perkins words 
that the business world was tough and it still is

when eastern airlines pilots and flight attendants gave up a 
9monthold strike in november without much hope of reclaiming 
their jobs the surrender came as no surprise 
president reagans unprecedented firing of 11400 striking air 
traffic controllers in 1981 touched off a decade of retreat for 
american labor 
many historians say the 1980s will go down as a pivotal era when 
oncepowerful unions faced assault from a mix of political 
conservatism deregulation americas declining economic might and 
a barrage of corporate takeovers that resulted in unfamiliar owners 
and sudden layoffs 
while more than 12 million people joined the work force in this 
country union membership shrank by 3 million and organizers groped 
for strategies to survive 
corporate clout strengthened as quickly as union power faded 
bosses formerly cowed by the muscle of big labor reclaimed the 
advantage in contract talks threatening to close plants and cut 
jobs unless they got concessions 
unionbusting once the work of hired thugs wielding baseball 
bats and shotguns was revived in the form of court orders clever 
publicity and righttowork legislation labor activists say 
you dont look under union busters in the phone book said 
lorrie mchugh a spokeswoman for the aflcio in washington you 
look under security attorneys and public relations firms 
the decade will be remembered by activists as the time when 
airline boss frank lorenzo broke unions by enforcing his way in 
bankruptcy court and federal prosecutors hobbled the mighty 
teamsters union with racketeering charges in criminal court 
it will be remembered by the united auto workers as the time 
when tennessee recruits of a japanese carmaker told one of the 
nations biggest unions to go away 
by the end of the decade instead of fighting for higher wages 
unions were struggling to retain past victories in such areas as 
health insurance job security and pensions 
labor also faced assault from another direction the lure of 
employees becoming bosses themselves employee stock ownership 
plans multiplied affecting companies that ranged from lumber mills 
to car rentals 
the rise of esops as they are called was part of a larger 
trend of takeovers and restructurings that sought to maxmize 
returns to shareholders often at the expense of jobholders 
clearly the employers have had the initiative in the last 10 
years said kim moody executive director of the labor education 
and research project in detroit this has forced the unions into 
a more defensive posture 
the catalyst for the retreat was the illfated strike by the 
professional air traffic controllers association which presented 
ronald reagan with the biggest domestic challenge in the first year 
of his presidency 
he ordered the federal aviation administration to dismiss and 
replace the strikers stunning the union and temporarily wreaking 
havoc on the nations network of commercial air traffic a few 
months later patco dissolved most of its members jobless and 
bitter 
obviously when you have a president who goes in and busts a 
union it sends a strong signal to other industries said ms 
mchugh if the president can do it you can too 
richard belous a labor economist with the national planning 
association a washingtonbased research group said the patco 
strike marked the end of three decades of union advances 
it had tremendous symbolism he said the strike gave 
management the intestinal fortitude to do things it wouldnt have 
done before 
others said the economys weakness in the beginning of the 
decade played an important role in eroding union influence by 
undermining the premise that a union shop means secure jobs 
deregulation was another major factor said alvin bauman a 
division chief at the bureau of labor statistics in washington 
where you once had a monopoly dominated by unionized firms 
deregulation made it possible for nonunion firms to come in and 
compete 
bureau of labor statistics figures show about 201 million 
working americans belonged to unions in 1980 about 23 percent of 
the total work force by last year the number of union members had 
shrunk to 17 million or 168 percent of the total 
union leaders contend they are not passive observers in the 
unraveling of their power 
while attention focused on the uaws embarassing failure at the 
nissan motors plant in smyrna tenn earlier this year the bakery 
workers union organized a russell stover candy plant down the road 
the uaw itself has organized other professional workers this 
decade in an effort to diversify uaw members now range from office 
clerks to jaialai players 
although business groups contend labors use of the strike is 
declining because it is ineffective unions say the strike remains 
one of their potent weapons 
the machinists union strike against the prosperous boeing co 
for example was approved overwhelmingly in september and produced 
a victory for the workers in less than two months 
a protracted strike this fall by the communications workers of 
america and international brotherhood of electrical workers against 
nynex corp one of the baby bell telephone companies forced it to 
capitulate on a key demand of the strikers employerpaid health 
insurance 
organized labor helped defeat the appointment of reagans 
supreme court nominee robert bork partly because of his perceived 
antiunion views 
perhaps their most important victory of the decade labor 
leaders say was congressional passage of a plant closing law in 
1988 which gives workers at least 60 days notice of layoffs 
the law was designed to stem the growing number of companies 
that have shut factories without warning and moved manufacturing to 
cheaper locations asia latin america and the caribbean 
but some say the law is a hollow victory that could discourage 
potential employers from establishing new businesses in the united 
states some even see the law as a symbol of labors weakness 
i think its going to be a very hard time for labor in the 
1990s belous said labor has been pushed back from the 40yard 
line to the 10yard line

it was almost unimaginable the wests 
most prominent banker jetting to moscow to advise the archenemy of 
capitalism 
but federal reserve chairman alan greenspan recently made such a 
trip a sign of the extraordinary changes that marked the 80s 
overseas 
it was a decade marked by the pursuit of a formula for economic 
success a drive that brought about wrenching changes the big 
winners were the most modern complex and open economies far down 
on the list were those dependent on natural resources and those 
with closed controlled systems 
in eastern europe some countries took their first halting 
steps toward westernstyle economies and integration into the world 
economy 
in western europe the european community finally took seriously 
its decision to fashion a single market of the dozen nations by 
1992 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries went on a 
rollercoaster ride that carried oil prices to wild levels before 
crashing and finally recovering 
africa was caught up in the foreign debt crisis that swept the 
worlds developing nations in the early 1980s sapping their 
economic strength and impoverishing their growing populations even 
more 
in europe the events that captured the imagination that seemed 
least likely at the start of the decade stemmed from the soviets 
tacit acknowledgement that their economic system had failed 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev who came to power in march 
1985 pressed his perestroika program to restructure the backward 
economy trying to wrench it from centrally planned ways to a more 
marketoriented system 
there was talk of price reform and private enterprise more 
consumer goods and fewer government subsidies 
there can be no return to the old style of economic 
management asserted vladimir shemiatenkov moscows envoy to the 
european community 
but gorbachevs task remains staggering inflation is high and 
so is the governments budget deficit millions have been thrown 
out of work by the modernization efforts workers strike and 
consumers grumble 
they dont have a decent economic reform program yet said 
jan vanous of planecon a washington forecasting firm 
despite the daunting challenge reform fever is spreading in 
eastern europe particularly hungary long a leader of economic 
reform in the communist bloc and poland where the new solidarity 
leadership plans to move swiftly to a market economy 
east germany once one of the most conservative members of the 
soviet bloc joined the rush west germany offered massive 
financial aid in return for steppedup economic and political 
reforms 
the european community quickly negotiated broad trade and 
economic cooperation agreements with poland and hungary and a 
smaller pact with czechoslovakia deals also were pursued with the 
kremlin and east germany 
among the western powers a wealth of proposals were offered for 
reaching their goal of a europeanwide market by 1992 in contrast 
to the new freedoms symbolized by the crumbling berlin wall the 
1992 preparations were characterized by heated disagreements over 
ways to dismantle the barriers separating the common market allies 
british prime minister margaret thatcher clashed with others in 
their vision of europes future she fought proposals to create a 
common currency and central bank system fearing a loss of 
sovereignty 
britains destiny lies in europe argued nigel lawson whose 
october resignation as britains top treasury official rocked the 
government he urged mrs thatcher to relent and link the pound to 
europes other major currencies 
the linkage system the exchange rate mechanism of the european 
monetary system has brought the economies more in line analysts 
say 
with the opening of borders between the germanys concern was 
raised that the bonn government would forsake the west for the 
east government officials hastily insisted they were with the 
european community 
the united states aggressively monitored the communitys 1992 
campaign complaining of any moves to keep its products out of the 
new marketplace the term fortress europe was coined europeans 
denied protectionism was afoot 
for opec the decade was trying 
the 1979 revolution in iran a major oilproducing nation was 
marked by a sharp drop in crude production world oil prices soared 
above 40 a barrel shocking the economies of the united states and 
other industrialized nations 
in late 1985 the cartel shifted strategy to defend its fair 
share of the world oil market a production freeforall sent 
prices crashing futures prices for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark american crude plunged to near 10 a barrel in march 
1986 
toward the decades end opec pulled itself together key 
members iran and iraq at war most of the decade resolved some 
differences and the cartel as a whole became less confrontational 
with consuming nations demand for the cartels oil grew and 
prices rebounded to around 20 per barrel 
in africa the 80s were years of unrelieved misery 
subsaharan africa as a whole has now witnessed almost a 
decade of falling percapita incomes increasing hunger and 
accelerating ecological degradation according to a world bank

in a decade of asian economic success japan piled 
up no 1 labels four other countries gained the nickname 
tigers and the star performers amassed more money to fuel 
their advance into the 1990s 
the standouts lack abundant natural resources but have 
governments that encourage private business they share a confucian 
ethic stressing education hard work and thrift high savings rates 
have helped pay for new and better production facilities 
dependence on exports forced factories to hone efficiencies 
needed to compete in the international marketplace government 
steps to hold down inflation promoted confidence and stability 
success in the frontrunners including tigers south korea 
taiwan hong kong and singapore helped pull up some of the 
followers like thailand and malaysia both by example and by 
expanding trade and investment 
asias giant china also tried stressing a diligencethrift 
ethic to make its 1 billion people more productive and less poor 
but lacked the incentives of its neighbors freemarket economies 
and their managerial skills and education levels amid scarcities 
spending on construction and efforts to live better ended up 
overheating the economy 
war impoverished vietnam and cambodia although vietnam ended 
the decade by withdrawing what it said were its last troops in 
cambodia and trying to free its economy from some of the strictures 
of central planning 
the philippines amid a intensifying political crisis struggled 
with a legacy of foreign debt from the rule of the late president 
ferdinand marcos whose businessmen associates came to rely more on 
favors than initiative 
japan struggled with problems of the rich as its high exports 
and highprofile acquisitions abroad aroused resentment it became 
the worlds largest creditor in 1985 and the rise of the yen 
inflated its international financial power 
in 1987 the economic newspaper nihon keizai shimbun calculated 
that japan had become the worlds richest nation on paper with 
437 trillion in total assets such as land factories and stock 
compared with us assets of 362 trillion 
the inflated wealth plus japans high savings rate and its 
industries new ability to finance their own investments gave 
japanese banks the funds to become major players in world finance 
japanese purchases of corporations and property in the united 
states became a sensitive issue although americans continued 
seeking japanese investment 
the abundance of funds in japans stock markets also has given 
its corporations access to lowcost financing that us companies 
cannot match 
american corporations with access to such funds likely would be 
tempted to try to buy out a competitor said eric rasmussen an 
economist at jardine fleming securities in tokyo while japanese 
firms tend to focus on productive capacity 
come 1991 or 1992 life could get very exciting for us 
companies they are going to emerge from a period of sluggish 
growth and long recuperation confronted with a flood of 
highquality japanese exports he said 
this will be a result of japanese companies strong balance 
sheets rather than an overall national strategy he said 
in taiwan too companies used to rely on banks as their main 
source of funds now they can raise more money from the stock 
market and dont have to worry about banks withdrawing loans in 
case of an economic slowdown said yeh chihyung vice president 
of capital securities co 
officials said many of the 170 listed companies have used such 
funds to automate equipment and make more sophisticated products to 
overcome the impact of the rising taiwan dollar 
in japan the yens rise since 1985 forced a major change in 
middecade from reliance on exports to depending on the home 
market to fuel economic growth 
but despite their countrys image most japanese dont feel 
rich says isamu miyazaki chairman of the daiwa institute of 
research 
he cited workdays exceeding those in the west by perhaps 600 
hours a year cramped housing and long commutes through congested 
traffic and prices that while stable exceed other industrialized 
nations by 20 percent to 30 percent these result from government 
protection of agriculture and an inefficient distribution system 
he said 
in south korea kim yong director of the economic planning 
board said curbs on government budgets and wage raises kept annual 
inflation between 23 percent and 71 percent down from more than 
15 percent in the previous decade the government also encouraged 
competition to sharpen efficiency and stressed technical 
renovation labor unrest has erupted in korea over the last year 
however 
in china rural production improved as the government ended 
factorystyle commune farming and gave families a chance to do some 
of their own marketing and use spare time for sideline business 
but in the staterun factories efforts to boost productivity 
faced the iron rice bowl a system of lifetime employment in 
which workers are paid the same regardless of labor performed 
after cracking down on the democracy movement in june the 
communist party promoted leaders favoring order and central 
planning over giving wider play to market forces 
the next two largest asian nations india and indonesia also 
lag in education with indonesias literacy rate at 26 percent and 
indias at 36 percent 
the world bank has given indonesia high marks in recent years 
for boosting growth by encouraging the private sector with improved 
incentives and deregulation and moving to shift the economy away 
from heavy reliance on oil exports 
indias government has favored state planning in efforts to 
reduce income inequalities and promote rapid industrialization but 
analysts say this inwardlooking policy has hurt efficiency and 
growth 
australia which looks toward asia in its economic activity 
shares its more successful neighbors freemarket economy and high 
education level but its economic performance depends more than 
theirs on prices for commodities its major exports include coal 
and farm products

the 1980s brought an explosion of 
prosperity to developed countries but was a lost decade for 
many latin american nations that experienced more wretchedness than 
glorious excess 
living standards fell sharply as an estimated 204 billion 
flowed out of the region most to service a collective foreign debt 
of 430 billion 
the crisis latin american nations are undergoing has a name 
written with capital letters foreign debt venezuela president 
carlos andres perez said in march after antigovernment riots in 
which 300 were killed and 2000 injured 
budget adjustments austerity programs and economic stagnation 
have made the 1980s the lost decade miguel de la madrid then 
mexicos president said at a latin summit last year 
during the 1970s borrowing spurred economic development 
throughout the region most notably in brazils socalled miracle 
of doubledigit annual growth and low inflation 
railroads steel mills copper mines hydroelectric dams 
nuclear power plants airports highways ports and subways were 
constructed from mexicos us frontier thousands of miles south to 
argentina the last stop before antarctica 
development seemed to accompany democracy as civilians replaced 
soldiers in honduras in 1981 bolivia in 1982 argentina in 1983 
brazil and uruguay in 1985 
borrowing grew on a large scale despite a steady rise in 
interest rates and shrinkage of trade surpluses it continued 
almost to the moment mexico and brazil the biggest third world 
debtors were forced to suspend repayments 
that development in mid1982 set off shock waves in corporate 
boardrooms and government corridors and prompted projections of a 
rupture in the world banking system 
while that did not happen the rest of the decade was filled 
with bitter sparring between bankers and bureaucrats the former 
trying to dam the flow of red ink and the latter juggling credit 
needs against a rising tide of malnutrition illiteracy and 
homelessness 
the average percapita income of an argentine was 1990 in 
1980 and 360 less in 1988 world bank figures show mexicos 
gross national product shrank for seven straight years real wages 
in venezuela have slipped by onethird since 1981 and now are 
estimated at the 1964 level 
chile which under the rightist regime of president gen augusto 
pinochet pursued policies of export expansion and a balanced budget 
ahead of most neighbors was not as badly hurt 
colombia paraguay bolivia and uruguay and until this year 
venezuela which has huge oil deposits usually fulfilled their 
debt obligations on time albeit with difficulty as world commodity 
prices plunged 
peru is a special case president alan garcia capped debt 
repayment at 10 percent of export earnings a move that shut the 
country out of international credit markets explosive growth was 
followed by hyperinflation and recession 
in most latin countries debt repayments during the 1980s took 
up ever larger shares of national budgets leaving less money for 
public housing schools hospitals argentina alloted 20 percent of 
its budget to education in 1972 and only 6 percent in 1986 
roads deteriorated completion of yacyreta dam in argentina one 
of the largest construction projects in the world was postponed 
work on xingo dam the biggest public project under way in brazil 
was halted in october 
investment dried up todays factories are obsolete a drought 
that shifted electricity production to coal and oilfired 
generators resulted in brownouts in argentina and uruguay earlier 
this year nine of every 10 cars in mexico are at least 5 years old 
by printing money in part to pay the debt latin nations brought 
on devaluations ruinous inflation and recession three months 
after the rioting in venezuela this year hungry argentines sacked 
food stores in cities surrounded by wheat fields dairy farms and 
some of the worlds most fertile cropland 
brazilian presidential candidate luis inacio da silva reflected 
the emotions and rhetoric the debt issue can generate when he 
said during his campaign leading up to national elections on nov 
15 
the third world war has already started it is a war by 
the united states against the latin american continent and the 
third world it is war over the foreign debt one which has as its 
main weapon interest payments a weapon more deadly than the 
atomic bomb 
as the decade ends a resolution seems closer than at any time 
since 1982 
latin leaders talk less of moratoriums and acknowledge that many 
of their economic problems are the result not of the debt but of 
government fiscal monetary and exchange rate policies 
much of the debt was spent to balance budgets subsidize food 
prices maintain unrealistic exchange rates and buy military 
weapons they acknowledge rather than to create an infrastructure 
that would repay it 
billions of dollars were squandered in bribes kickbacks 
illegal commissions and graft perhaps too much money was borrowed 
jose angel gurria mexicos main debt negotiator said its 
indispensable not to forget the lessons of our own history and 
recent past we cannot repeat the error of taking on excessive 
debt 
brazils total current debt is 110 billion mexico owes 1074 
billion argentina 65 billion venezuela 35 billion they are 
the four biggest debtors in the developing world 
bankers now seem to agree that economic growth must precede 
repayment and that much of the debt is unpayable as latin leaders 
have argued for years 
lending institutions are accepting proposals they once resisted 
lower interest rates deferred principal payments debtequity 
swaps outright forgiveness meanwhile governments of many 
countries are selling off stateowned enterprises and giving 
capitalism a chance 
john reed chairman of citibank said he is optimistic that 
early in the 1990s the debt crisis will abate latin countries 
will have easier access to international credit he predicted and 
banks will be paid what they are owed 
reed cited mexicos recent agreement with creditors to exchange 
debt for 30year bonds and venezuelas offer to set aside oil 
revenues as collateral to banks willing to write down their loans 
late in 1989 even defiant peru said it would resume payments on 
overdue loans to the international monetary fund 
when the mexican debt relief plan was announced last july 
president carlos salinas de gortari voiced the hope of all who had 
struggled with the problem 
the result does not mean that by magic our problems have 
ceased to exist we will have to keep working but each day 
will be a little better

there are many reasons to question whether americas economic 
and political dominance in world affairs will continue 
a major concern centers around the erosion that has occurred in 
american manufacturing if we look at individual segments some are 
now controlled completely by foreign competitors and others are 
losing their dominance 
weakness in our industrial base hurts our national ability to 
compete as more and more industries decline the manufacturers 
that rely upon them lose a competitive advantage 
japanese automakers for example enjoy the advantage of a 
leading edge not only in such industries as consumer electronics 
and semiconductors but also in machine tools optics and many 
more these industries constantly furnish the japanese auto 
industry with new ideas and products in america we are slowly 
losing the advantages of similar partnerships as more and more 
sectors of our industrial base weaken 
does america have time to catch up yes we do but our work 
extends far beyond individual industries to larger problems in our 
society 
in education statistics indicate we are losing ground students 
14 years old and older are dropping out of school at a rate of 
700000 annually thirteen percent of all 17yearolds who are 
still in school are functionally illiterate 
in capital investment we are far behind the other major 
industrial economies in the percentage of gross national product we 
invest in modernizing our factories and offices in october the 
wall street journal described the capital spending boom that is 
under way in japan overall japanese capital spending this year 
will be more than 520 billion 5 percent more than american 
companies will spend yet japans total output is less than 
twothirds of ours 
not all of this spending will go to build new capacity the 
journal reported that 14 percent will be spent on new or improved 
products 17 percent will be used to cut costs and 12 percent will 
be for research and development 
clearly we have our work cut out for us if we hope to compete 
in an environment such as this in todays global market no nation 
has a longterm advantage in technology managerial wisdom or 
creativity expertise intellectual capital abounds all over 
the globe 
america can compete in this environment if we choose to but 
to succeed we must pay strict attention to certain timeproven 
fundamentals four are particularly critical product quality 
keeping the customer in sharp focus cost control that does not 
sacrifice investment and most important rediscovering the value 
of the employees who do the work and generate the ideas 
can american leadership in world affairs continue certainly 
but we must make significant longterm progress in two key areas 
education is the first the national crisis in primary and 
secondary education must be resolved but we cannot stop here more 
of our brightest students must seek careers in science mathematics 
and engineering 
second we must strengthen our industrial base by manufacturing 
more of our vital components it is always easy to buy things from 
someone else but rebuilding our industrial base will require 
investment in the necessary plants and technology this is hard 
work and the payback often can be far down the road yet we have 
no choice if we want to succeed 
america is in a race that we cannot refuse to run if we are to 
cross the finish line it will take much time and a great deal of 
hard work todays problems were a long time in the making and 
they will not be solved with shortterm actions 
yet with resolve and commitment the united states can continue 
to prosper and lead

it has been said for a long time that the world is shifting from 
a bipolar structure with the united states and the soviet union 
having overwhelming influence to a multipolar one 
the situation is changing quickly now symbolized by the opening 
of the berlin wall there is rapid reconciliation between east and 
west there are calls to build a new political and economic order 
for the world in the 21st century and expectations are mounting 
for the united states to exercise its leadership 
former president reagan began the rebuilding of a strong united 
states ready and able to act as a true world leader president bush 
has taken over where reagan left off and moved forward this is 
especially so in the area of economic revitalization and the 
future outlook appears to be bright 
without doubt the united states began to face up to its 
problems with the twin deficits in the area of the macroeconomy 
in the 1980s 
however i would like to make note of the voices gradually 
growing in us industry to make efforts to improve productivity 
and quality and to become more exportoriented 
i see it as evidence of a significant turning point for the 
overall economy in the united states especially notable was the 
report last june by the massachusetts institute of technology 
entitled made in america it was a proposal to bolster us 
manufacturing industry and it clearly pointed out problems in 
industry and indicated directions for improvement 
the report 
criticized the pursuit of shortterm profit 
said there was overconfidence in us technology and delay in 
adapting to technological innovation 
found a lack of efforts to improve quality 
found disharmony in actions of the government and private 
sector 
recommended increased investment better education of the work 
force a more harmonized and cooperative relationship between 
organizations and their employees and more international thinking 
it is certainly true that us leadership of the worlds 
politics and economies since world war ii has been sustained by its 
industrial competitiveness based on its eminent productivity and 
technological strength 
now since the united states has begun to reconstruct its 
manufacturing industry i believe the revitalization of the us 
economy is real and the united states will continue to hold the 
reins of power leading the world politically and economically in 
the future 
many japanese corporations determined to satisfy changing 
customer wants and needs have been opening up factories in the 
united states to put production close to the consumer 
we are making efforts to expand local employment increase the 
localcontent ratio of our products and blend into local 
communities in other words we have been establishing ourselves as 
us corporations 
as international business activities continue to transcend 
national boundaries the need to bolster us industrial 
competitiveness has already become an important issue not only for 
corporations with bases and business operations in america but 
also for us corporations based in japan 
we as international business people would like to contribute 
to the further strengthening of the us economy

it was a common theme throughout the 80s at 
the dinner table in academic papers white house discussions 
political controversies international debates the subject was 
money and it was on everyones mind 
money was the biggest economic puzzle of the decade for those 
who made an awful lot of it for those who fell far behind in their 
material well being and for those who simply struggled to keep 
pace 
if wealth wasnt discussed it was poverty if not inflation 
then the threat of it if not immediate monthly bills then the 
prospect that social security and private insurance plans wouldnt 
take care of ones old age 
uncle sam worried about a huge and growing federal deficit and a 
trade imbalance that threatened americas global economic 
leadership 
banks worried the nations big commercial institutions had made 
billions of dollars in loans to the third world and it had become 
apparent those loans might never be repaid late in the decade the 
banks began writing them off or setting aside reserves for that 
possibility 
business worried a new definition of debt took hold it meant 
that enormous amounts of money borrowed at extremely high interest 
rates was now an accepted method of financing corporations company 
after company was threatened with takeover by raiders armed with 
billions of dollars in such credit 
investors worried about the stock market the dow jones 
industrial average pierced new levels poking above the 2700 mark 
in 1987 and again in 1989 but the market suffered its worst 
collapse in half a century on black monday 
in spite of the huge runup those 2700 points didnt represent 
a new high in real terms adjusted for inflation the dow hit its 
alltime high way back in january 1966 to match that high the 
1989 dow would have had to reach 3900 points 
buyers sellers and owners of housing worried too as variable 
rate mortgages rose into the double digits and then descended 
toward single numbers late in the decade real estate taxes 
generally rose as well a big income tax cut was passed to roaring 
acclaim early in the decade but almost every dollar saved as a 
result of it was nibbled away by piecemeal increases that followed 
ordinary americans never were relieved of money worries while 
all those big billions were talked about average hourly earnings 
of many americans grew little in the 1980s aspirations didnt 
they kept rising and as a result consumer debt did also 
unsolicited bankcard credit became available in the thousands of 
dollars to millions of americans who just a decade earlier 
wouldnt have qualified for personal loans at a fraction of the 
amounts 
the unevenness persisted throughout the decade beginning in one 
of the worst recessions of the century accompanied by what 
president carter referred to as a malaise of the american spirit 
a new president helped lift spirits talking a freeenterprise 
language based in faith that what the country needed was a release 
of the pentup energies of americans their innovativeness their 
willingness to work hard their desire to participate and 
contribute and be proud 
president reagan promised to remove bureaucratic shackles that 
inhibited business to deregulate industries to take a more 
relaxed view of antitrust enforcement to lower taxes 
what resulted and who should be blamed or credited will be 
debated until the end of the century 
business did indeed pick up and before the decade was over 
american goods were becoming competitive at home and abroad the 
gross national product 263 trillion as the decade began reached 
more than 5 trillion in 1989 trade deficits continued however 
and some americans were astonished to realize that it was the money 
from their purchases of foreign goods that helped finance foreign 
takeovers of us companies and real estate and pay for foreign 
purchases of us securities 
big as they were the gains in gross national product worried 
many people because the numbers were swollen by inflation in 
constant or real dollars using the same 1982 buying power to 
measure gnp in both 1980 and 1989 the figures were 32 trillion 
for 1980 and about 41 trillion for 1989 
real corporate profits soared newbusiness formations rose 
more than 20 million jobs were created women went to work in 
growing numbers and many of the elderly came out of retirement to 
join teenagers in parttime positions at grocery stores and retail 
outlets 
the spirit of free enterprise was contagious but the rewards 
werent equally shared while the new sense of freedom displayed 
americas strengths it also showed weaknesses economic laissez 
faire made for an erratic even chaotic economic course one that 
sometimes moved in questionable directions 
stock market manipulations became almost commonplace corporate 
takeover artists blackmailed companies with unfriendly 
takeovers if they didnt pay their way out of it the stock market 
became more volatile made so by trading schemes whose goals were 
instant profits debt rose precipitously financial scandals eroded 
faith in both industry and certain government officials the 
economy operated at a high level but it wasnt well balanced to 
some it was a highwire act uncomfortable to watch because of the 
constant fear of a slip many were left out it was claimed by some 
economists that the number of people below the poverty line rose 
when inflation was subtracted from hourly wages they were barely 
higher as the decade ended thousands of farmers went broke the 
stock market was shunned by many individual investors and a large 
number of young households found buying a house an unaffordable 
challenge 
after seven years of expansion the spread of economic benefits 
was inconsistent by any measure at one point in 1986 economic 
strength was so geographically warped that the entire midsection 
of the country was strained by simultaneous weakness in farming 
heavy manufacturing mining and oil at the same time the east and 
west coasts and parts of the southeast enjoyed boom conditions 
based on strength in such sectors as recreation finance and 
computerrelated industries 
such inconsistencies led to questions rather than conclusions 
was something substantial created in the 1980s or was it sleight 
of hand did america strengthen itself or merely create the 
superficial impression by living off debt by passing on a huge 
burden for younger generations to pay 
america improved in many ways most people would agree but even 
those most convinced of progress wondered also if the economic 
substructure had been weakened in subtle ways particularly by 
debts and deficits 
uncertainty was the nature of the decade one of extreme pluses 
and minuses as the 90s approach most people are still taking an 
accounting and probably will be for years to come

ford motor co has acquired a controlling 
interest in jaguar plc as part of its 25billion takeover of the 
british luxurycar maker the no 2 us automaker said monday 
ford said that by the close of business friday it had acquired 
774 percent of the outstanding shares of jaguar stock including 
the 13 percent it owned prior to nov 2 
on that day ford and jaguar announced ford would bid for all of 
jaguars outstanding stock 
analysts have said adding the jaguar cars to fords product line 
would enhance fords image and provide a more stable financial base 
for jaguar 
however they wondered if the price ford was paying was too 
high considering the likelihood that ford would have to sink 
another 1 billion to upgrade manufacturing processes

it isnt a pleasant subject to face around 
christmas but it is appropriate to the season the subject is trash 
americans generate mountains of the stuff particularly around 
this time of year but they dont like to face the consequences 
they like it to disappear from their property and they dont like 
to think about it thereafter 
they must like to throw things away 35 pounds a day compared 
with 27 pounds a day per person in 1960 according to the 
environmental protection agency but they dont like to dwell on 
the fact that there is no away 
trash must go into recycling programs wastetoenergy 
facilities that burn it or into landfills the epa estimates 85 
percent of it goes into landfills which are filling up and closing 
down all over the country 
over the past 10 years according to an authority on the 
subject more than half the 18500 landfills that existed in 1979 
have closed and the epa now forecasts that by the 1990s only 4000 
will remain open 
conclusion much as they like to avoid it americans must face 
the issue of trash production trash collection and trash disposal 
lynn scarletts study might help already the study by scarlett 
research director of the reason foundation a conservative think 
tank based in santa monica calif has stirred interest in the 
industry and among policymakers 
the study points out four basic options available 
1 waste reduction policies 
2 recycling programs 
3 wastetoenery facilites that burn trash 
4 identification and construction of additional landfills 
scarlett observes that other industrialized nations already 
produce far less trash per person than the united states amply 
illustrating that it is possible through altered habits to 
generate less trash 
the japanese scarlett states produce only 76 percent the 
amount of garbage generated per person in the united states france 
produces even less about 60 percent and germany only 40 percent 
of american waste per person 
recycling efficiency also can be improved according to the 
study which concludes that waste hauled to landfills could be 
reduced 25 percent existing programs however handle less than 20 
percent of waste in their communities 
in fact what is referred to as recycling sometimes isnt much 
of what it earmarked for recycling merely ends up in the disposal 
site after all because in some cases the market for recycled 
products is depressed 
why asked a reason foundation spokesman should forests be 
harvested when the market for recycled newsprint might be falling 
in price his point the recycling of some items might 
simultaneously help conserve national assets 
the study states that experience with wastetoenery facilites 
produces the most dramatic results since incinerators are capable 
of handling up to 90 percent of the waste stream leaving only the 
inert ashes for disposal 
scarlett recommends all four strategies and that people be made 
aware of the costs involved which sometimes are hidden in general 
real estate taxes that customers be charged on a volume basis and 
that competition be invited from private garbage collectors and 
disposal services 
the study available at no charge to community officials 2716 
ocean park blvd santa monica calif 90405 cites seattles 
recycling program as a model that works and provides specifics on 
costs and savings in that city

prices closed lower in lackluster trading on 
londons stock exchange monday as the market shadowed wall 
streets narrow movements 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 121 
points or 05 percent to 23514 points 
volume amounted to a light 3495 million shares down from 4801 
million shares friday 
dealers estimated that about 6 points of the 100share indexs 
decline reflected the fact that several companies went 
exdividend monday including alliedlyons plc british telecom 
plc and hanson plc 
that means the deadline for buying shares to qualify for the 
companies next dividend has passed 
a stronger pound and news that british retail sales fell 08 
percent in november from the previous month had little effect on

wheat futures prices rose moderately monday on 
the chicago board of trade reflecting hope for new sales of the 
grain to the soviet union other grain and soybean futures finished 
narrowly mixed

departments announcement on friday that it had increased by 4 
million metric tons to 20 million metric tons the maximum amount of 
us grain the soviet union may purchase during the current 
marketing year 
further support for wheat stemmed from president bushs 
statement friday that he would push for granting 
mostfavorednation trade status to the soviet union the 
designation would allow for freer trade between the superpowers 
forecasts for extremely cold weather this week in the great 
plains prompted fears of damage to the winter wheat crop which

with the contract for delivery in december at 413 a bushel corn

economy and interest rates 
stock prices were mixed at the opening sagged to session lows 
just after midday then floundered for much of the session a late

out later this week 
reports on retail housing and auto sales as well as producer 
prices and industrial production are expected to provide further 
evidence of a slowing economy analysts said 
analysts said that investors hope more data suggesting a 
slowdown in economic growth will prompt the federal reserve to take 
steps to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and thus 
help improve corporate profits

bellsouth corp on monday agreed to terminate the 
proposed merger of its cellular telephone interests with those of 
lin broadcasting corp clearing the way for mccaw cellular 
communications inc to buy a controlling interest in lin for 338 
billion 
lin last week asked bellsouth to terminate its september 
agreement for merging the cellular telephone operations in a 
noncash deal lin last week recommended its shareholders approve 
mccaws latest offer 
bellsouth said it was not prepared to wage a bidding war 
our merger would have created the premier cellular company in 
the world but such decisions ultimately must reflect economic and 
strategic realities said bellsouth enterprises president william 
o mccoy 
new yorkbased lin was expected to accept a termination 
settlement that would pay bellsouth 665 million lin spokesman 
michael plouf said an agreement then would be signed to proceed 
with the mccaw deal 
mccaw chairman craig o mccaw said bellsouths announcement 
clears the way for us to complete our acquisition 
herschel schosteck whose silver spring md company follows 
the cellular telephone industry said it would have been unwise for 
bellsouth to compete with mccaw for lin 
bellsouths generally conservative shareholders probably would 
be averse to a prolonged takeover battle schosteck said a fight 
could have diluted earnings for years he said 
furthermore because it also provides regular land line 
telephone service bellsouth also was subject to certain regulatory 
considerations that would not apply to mccaw schosteck said 
bellsouths fiduciary responsibilities precluded them from 
following this through to the end he said 
lin fell 2 to 12225 a share monday bellsouth rose 1 to 
5450 a share and mccaw declined 75 cents to 3875 a share 
kirkland washbased mccaw which has sought lin for six 
months made a revised offer last week to buy a 501 percent 
controlling interest in lin for 15411 a share or a total of 
338 billion 
the mccawlin deal calls for mccaw to buy 219 million shares of 
lin mccaw which already owns 51 million lin shares would end up 
with just over 50 percent of lins 539 million common shares 
the 665 million termination fee for bellsouth was part of the 
previous linbellsouth agreement in which the two firms would have 
created a cellular telephone company with 55 million potential 
customers and dominance in some of the nations top markets 
bellsouth would have gotten 50 percent of the stock of the 
combined cellular company before the completion of the merger lin 
would have spun off its television broadcasting subsidiaries to 
stockholders and paid each shareholder a 20pershare special 
dividend 
in its initial offer made june 6 mccaw proposed a buyout of all 
of lins stock at 120 a share or a total of nearly 65 billion 
lin and mccaw tried to negotiate an agreement but after their 
talks broke down lin agreed to the bellsouth deal 
lins business includes cellular telephone broadcasting and 
publishing mccaw is the nations largest cellular phone company 
bellsouths offer to terminate the previous agreement also 
includes a provision for mccaw to contribute 265 million to los 
angelesbased rccs inc of which bellsouth owns 85 percent and 
mccaw 15 percent the california company owns an equity interest in 
the los angeles cellular telephone co 
in a related development monday standard amp poors announced it 
had removed bellsouth capital funding corp and bellsouth capital 
fundingaustralia ltd subsidiaries of the atlanta company from 
its creditwatch where they had been placed oct 30 
sampp reaffirmed its aaa ratings on senior unsecured debt for 
the subsidiaries in response bellsouths withdrawal from the

wyse technology inc the worlds second 
largest maker of computer terminals agreed monday to a 268 
million buyout by a taiwan group in a deal that could boost the 
companys flagging business 
wyse which is based in san jose but does all manufacturing in 
taiwan and elsewhere overseas began a search for buyers after 
losing 21 million in the 1989 fiscal year ended march 31 
the 10pershare buyout by channel international corp an 
investment group of government and local enterprises is the 
largest ever of a foreign firm by taiwan 
a lot of us companies looked at wyse but figured it wasnt 
worth more than 4 or 5 a share said michael murphy editor of 
california technology stockletter wyse got the best price it 
could from taiwan 
the acquisition is an important step for taiwans electronics 
and computer industries to enter the world market koo chengfu 
chairman of china investment and trust co the largest investor in 
the buyout said in a news conference in taiwan 
koo said his group would use wyses sales channels and 
technology personnel to promote taiwans hightechnology products 
wyse an 8yearold company that earned 28 million in fiscal 
1988 before slumping holds more than a 50 percent market share for 
generalpurpose terminals in the united states worldwide wyse 
trails only international business machines corp as a supplier of 
terminals said greg blatnik an industry analyst for dataquest 
inc in san jose 
terminals which can be hooked to mainframes minicomputers or 
personal computers accounted for 47 percent of wyses 452 million 
in sales in fiscal 1989 personal computers accounted for 39 
percent and screen monitors accounted for 14 percent of sales 
wyse is expected to sell 800000 terminals worldwide by the end 
of 1989 nearly all to businesses compared with just over 1 
million by ibm blatnik said 
in the first six months of fiscal 1990 ending sept 29 wyse 
had 231 million in revenue and net losses of 77 million 
wyse has been less successful in selling ibmcompatible personal 
computers and blatnik said that is the area that should get the 
most attention from the new taiwanese owners 
the whole concept of the deal has to be looked at as a 
positive step for wyse blatnik said it gives them financial 
stability and over the long term provides them with a better focus 
on the pc side of their business 
although wyse has a reputation for making lowpriced 
highquality terminals and personal computers its strategy in the 
pc market has hurt the companys growth said murphy 
wyse has a strategy of not producing the most advanced 
computers he said they wait to see how the latest technology 
shakes out and then try to move in with lower prices that hasnt 
worked out for them they need to be more innovative 
wyse chairman bernard k tse will remain with the company as 
vice chairman 
morris chang former senior vice president texas instruments and 
former president of general instrument corp will become chairman 
and chief executive officer of wyse 
chang has been serving as chairman of the industrial technology 
research institute a nonprofit research and development 
organization established in 1973 to accelerate the development of 
advanced technology in taiwan 
he said he doesnt plan significant nearterm changes in wyses 
product lines or its approach to business and intends to maintain 
its headquarters marketing and related operations in san jose 
taiwanese businessmen have shown growing interest in acquiring 
foreign firms which they believe could boost their business in the 
world market 
last month samuel hsieh governor of the central bank proposed 
using taiwans foreign reserves of about 73 billion for loans to 
local enterprises for overseas acquisitions

issue goldbacked bonds and halt all sales of gold on the open

energy analyst linda simard at drexel burnham lambert inc said 
buying enthusiasm in london spilled over into us markets in 
europe prices of gasoil the equivalent of us heating oil 
have firmed because of shortages and a seasonal pickup in demand 
she said there were reports monday that a drought in parts of 
europe which has caused low water levels on the rhine river has 
reduced production of hydroelectric power 
the result has been extra demand for alternative energy sources 
france now is importing more energy than it is exporting while 
normally the country is a net energy exporter simard said citing

844 issues down 669 up and 477 unchanged traders said 
hightechnology stocks led the losers after two brokerages lowered 
the investment ratings of compaq and apple computer companies 
wall street analysts attributed the markets overall weakness to 
investor uncertainty about the prospects for the economy and to 
profittaking after fridays modest rally

employment many economists have revised downward their 
fourthquarter economic forecasts the report showed the jobless 
rate rose to 54 percent from 53 percent in october in addition 
despite a gain of 210000 jobs in november octobers pace of jobs 
growth was revised downward 
the consensus before the report was for a growth rate of about 
15 percent now its closer to 1 percent johnson said 
analysts said many investors were noncommital ahead of a slew of 
new government reports due out this week which could provide a 
better clue about the economys direction among them november 
retail sales producer prices industrial production and capacity 
utilization 
investors hope further evidence of an economic slowdown will 
persuade the federal reserve to take steps to lower interest rates 
and thus help boost sagging corporate profits analysts said

yearend housecleaning in the absence of fresh economic news to 
stir the market

590 million credit card portfolio because of difficulties in 
competing with companies that operate multibillion dollar credit

the united states it ranked only 33rd among credit card suppliers 
the bank has 675000 mastercard and visa cardholders located

taylor said giant citicorp has credit card revenues of more than 
21 billion annually

to put our resources elsewhere

network throughout new england and on broadening its range of 
consumer finance products such as home equity residential 
mortgages and student loans

after four years of disagreements the 
international monetary fund announced on monday that it has reached 
an accord with peru raising the prospect of financial aid if 
peruvian policies meet its approval 
an official of the fund who spoke on condition he not be named 
said peru had made a payment of 423 million on the 800 million 
it owes the fund the payment covers only the arrears since 
september of this year 
the agreement was reached last week between perus negotiator 
abel salinas and michal camdessus the funds french managing 
director the official said 
owned by 152 governments the fund negotiates at length with 
governments in financial trouble it gives its help only when the 
borrowing government agrees on a set of policies it approves 
usually these include cuts in government spending especially on 
official payrolls and subsidies and often a devaluation of the 
countrys currency 
peru has been in trouble with the financial world since 
president alan garcia was elected in 1985 and announced that he 
would make only partial payments of interest on the countrys 
debts at that time peru owed 14 billion abroad now the figure is 
closer to 20 billion 
its financial troubles have been worsened by the continuing 
rebellion of a leftist guerrilla group the shining path and a 
thriving traffic in drugs 
peru is one of 10 countries with a total arrears of 35 billion 
to the fund and so ineligible for more finanical aid from it or 
much from anyone else this year the fund started a series of what 
it called shadow programs under which governments promised new 
policies but got no immediate money vietnam zambia somalia and 
now peru have started such programs 
if the fund finds they are doing well after a year or so they 
will start getting its financial help

the labor department on monday said it has obtained 
an order requiring eastern airlines to help striking and laidoff 
employees obtain continued health benefits 
employers must know that the labor department is serious about 
protecting the right of working americans to continued health 
coverage in cases like eastern elizabeth dole secretary of 
labor said in a statement released in washington concerning 
eastern and the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act 
the consent order which requires eastern to report on its 
compliance quarterly for five years followed an investigation by 
labor officials into complaints by eastern cobra participants who 
said insurance carriers told them they were no longer covered even 
though the employees had paid insurance premiums the federal law 
says employers must give terminated employees the chance to obtain 
continued health benefits at group rates 
as a result officials began a largescale investigation into 
possible violations of notification and insurance claims processing 
provisions under cobra said david george ball assistant labor 
secretary 
wally haber senior general chairman of the machinists union 
thats been on strike since march 4 said employees were 
inappropriately rejected on claims or faced backlogs of up to six 
months 
weve been having a running battle with eastern on the cobra 
violations haber said 
haber said just before the strike began eastern laid off most 
of its workers in the insurance department which contributed to 
the backlog haber said employees have had better results recently 
eastern spokesman robin matell said claims were taking an 
average of four weeks to process he said the consent order would 
have no financial impact on eastern 
were uptodate now he said 
matell blamed initial problems on a combination of hostile 
unionmanagement relations the complications of the chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization eastern filed for march 9 and the 
massive number of employees suddenly on strike o laid off also he 
said eastern had computer problems that exacerbated the delays 
we feel that we really reacted admirably in the unusual 
circumstances matell said the cobra law never contemplated 
such wideranging and massive problems 
eastern has been operating as a much smaller airline because of 
the strike and bankruptcy reorganization it reportedly is close to 
selling latin american routes to amr corp parent of american 
airlines for 300 million to 400 million 
neither fort worthbased amr nor eastern would discuss the deal 
reported in several newspapers but there was speculation a deal 
could be announced by wednesday when eastern is scheduled to meet 
with a committee of creditors 
the negotiations with amr on the latin american routes are the 
second round since eastern sought chapter 11 protection earlier 
attempts to sell the routes to amr foundered over disagreements 
involving a lawsuit filed against american by continental airlines 
the other main texas air subsidiary 
during the strike american the nations largest airline has 
been expanding aggressively in the caribbean a key area for 
eastern

royal crown cola co has asked the federal trade 
commission to invoke sanctions against bigger rivals pepsico and 
cocacola co for what it called predatory pricing by their 
companyowned bottling plants 
al burke president and chief operating officer of royal crown 
said monday that the company has asked the ftc for sanctions 
against the two royal crown has requested that pepsi and coke be 
prohibited from acquiring additional holdings in their franchise 
systems burke disclosed at a beverage industry gathering in new 
york 
in addition he said the ftc should order the two companies to 
divest their interests in companyowned bottling plants and the 
brands other than coke and pepsi produced by those operations 
under the request royal crown has asked the ftc to require that 
the two companies each reduce their holdings in companyowned 
plants to 25 percent within two years at which time they would be 
sold 
atlantabased cocacola declined comment saying it was unaware 
of any ftc investigation of the issue said spokesman randy 
donaldson 
pepsico based in purchase said it hasnt been contacted on the 
matter by the federal agency or royal crown 
theres really nothing new here and certainly nothing the 
industry hasnt heard before said tod mackenzie a spokesman for 
the companys pepsi cola operations 
royal crowns appeal to the ftc is the second time in three 
years the company has filed complaints with the agency against coke 
and pepsi in 1986 royal crown asked the ftc to block pepsis 
proposed acquisition of sevenup co and cokes planned buyout of 
dr pepper claiming the purchases would violate federal antitrust 
laws 
the ftc later blocked the acquisitions on antitrust grounds 
royal crown based in miami is a subsidiary of chesapeake 
financial corp which is in turn controlled by industrialist 
victor posner 
in his talk burke called predatory pricing the most serious 
problem facing the us soft drink industry 
predatory pricing consists of pricing products below cost to 
beat competitors then quickly hiking them back up after the action 
has succeeded 
burke charged for example that it costs bottlers about 80 
cents to put a twoliter bottle in a supermarket but coke and 
pepsi both sold the bottles for 69 cents each last labor day 
weekend in dallas 
coke has 411 percent of the us soft drink market followed by 
pepsi with 311 percent royal crown has only 28 percent 
according to beverage digest an industry publication

banks and foreign exchange houses 
were closed monday to give them time to digest the 
governmentordered 345 percent currency devaluation along with 
the postponement of payments on the nations massive internal debt 
initial reaction was mixed over the plan which was the second 
severe economic adjustment in five months spokesmen for organized 
labor criticized it while many businessmen said the changes were 
necessary to stabilize the economy 
both sides expected rates to be increased for electricity 
transportation and other public services which along with the 
devaluation was expected to acclerate inflation 
economy minister nestor rapanelli said monday night in a speech 
broadcast nationwide that an increase in inflation would be 
transitory and that the governments program of deregulation 
and privatization would continue 
rapanelli blamed the need for the new measures on speculative 
maneuvers that put pressure on the exchange rate 
the government news agency telam reported late monday that the 
prices of many consumer items that had been regulated including 
stereos washing machines clothing shoes fresh chicken coffee 
would be freed 
however about a dozen basic commodities including cooking 
oil rice pasta bread and tea would be subject to controls that 
set maximum prices 
shortly before midnight sunday the government devalued the 
austral to 1000 per us dollar from the previous rate of 
655to1 bringing the austral in line with its black market value 
statecontrolled gasoline prices were boosted by about 60 
percent bringing the price of a gallon of regular gas to the 
equivalent of 144 
to help argentines cope with the measures the government 
authorized monthly pay increases for december of 30 to public 
employees and 24 for private sector employees 
unions which already had been staging pay strikes said the 
raises were not enough commuter train lines were halted by 
stoppages monday and court clerks pledged to renew their boycott 
that disrupted the judicial system nationwide last week 
this adjustment plan does not help the interests of workers 
said ruben pereyra of the general labor confederation the 3 
millionmember coalition that includes most every argentine union 
livio kuhl a spokesmen for business leaders who met with 
president carlos menem just before the measures were announced 
said they supported the changes along with menems plans to 
privatize and deregulate argentinas economy 
the measures particularly the pay increases and the 
devaluation almost certainly will stoke inflation that has grown 
at tripledigit rates in 14 of the past 15 years 
the last economic adjustment on july 9 devalued the austral by 
54 percent hiked public service rates by 200 percent and more and 
imposed wage and price guidelines 
that helped bring monthly inflation down to 56 percent in 
october from 197 percent in july but fueled labor unrest because 
real wages did not keep pace with price hikes 
the november inflation rate was 65 percent higher than the 
previous month for the first time since menem took office on july 
8 the december rate will be doubledigit independent analysts 
projected 
the price of a kilogram of beef or 22 pounds soared by 40 
percent monday to the equivalent of 54 cents 
in an effort to curtail a flow of australs into the economy 
which would renew downward pressure on the exchange rate if 
argentines chose to buy dollars the government announced sunday it 
would delay the payment of stateissued bonds by two years 
the governments internal debt is estimated at 7 billion or 
about 10 percent of the gross national product about 650 million 
was due to be paid by march 1 
interest will continue to be paid the economy ministry said

the troubled junk bond market 
claimed the job of one of its biggest supporters monday when thomas 
spiegel said he would quit as chairman of columbia savings amp loan 
association at the end of the year 
under the leadership of spiegel a former wall street trader 
columbia invested more heavily than any other thrift in highyield 
highrisk bonds turning big profits on them until recently 
but new federal laws forced columbia to essentially return to 
being a conventional mortgage lender the thrift in october marked 
down the price of its junk bonds to reflect their depressed market 
value as required by new federal law taking a loss of about 350 
million columbia plans to sell the junk bonds to a new subsidiary 
previously thrifts didnt have to adjust the book value of 
their bonds to account for market price because they carried them 
as longterm investments 
columbias highyield portfolio is now worth 38 billion down 
from 43 billion at the end of last year and spiegel said the 
thrift urgently needed to rid itself of the bonds 
spiegel said he would work full time as a consultant to 
columbia trying to line up investors for the subsidiary into which 
the junk bonds would be spun off 
a thrift bailout bill signed by president bush in august 
requires thrifts to sell their junk bonds by 1994 under the 
legislation thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through 
separately capitalized affiliates rather than using 
governmentinsured deposits 
business imperatives coupled with the publicity surrounding me 
led me to conclude that a new ceo with extensive banking or thrift 
experience was required to lead columbia into the future spiegel 
said in a statement 
columbia said it already had begun interviewing potential 
successors 
spiegel is a friend of junk bond pioneer michael milken who has 
been indicted on racketeering and securities fraud charges new 
charges against milken reportedly will include allegations of 
illegal stock and bond deals with columbia 
spiegel was unavailable for an interview but columbia 
spokeswoman lenore hatch said he intended to hold the bonds to 
maturity in the new columbia subsidiary she said it was too early 
to describe in detail how the subsidiary would work 
hopefully the structure were considering would have the 
effect of removing the volatility thats in the highyield 
market she said 
spiegel said in his statement that the depressed market for junk 
bonds had created big opportunities 
during the eight years in which i have been actively involved 
in the highyield securities market i have never seen better 
values he said 
spiegel 43 noted that his family owns more than half of 
columbias common stock i believe that it is urgent that i move 
rapidly to preserve and enhance the value of our securities 
portfolio he said 
fueled largely by spiegels investments in junk bonds 
columbias assets jumped to 13 billion this year from 400 million 
in 1974 
but in the third quarter of this year columbia lost 226 million 
as a result of 3575 million in losses related to those bond 
holdings 
columbia said that because of problems with junk bond 
investments it will be unable to meet the tougher requirements for 
riskbased capital under the savings and loan bailout law 
in order to boost its capital columbia has agreed to sell 
nearly all its mortgagebacked securities for about 90 million 
and to sell certain public and private equities for a gain of 
about 75 million the thrift said in a statement 
columbia said it has raised 10 million more through various 
asset sales and other actions 
thrift institutions like columbia that do not meet the new 
capital requirements are required to file a capital plan acceptable 
to federal regulators by jan 8 columbia said its plan will as 
required detail its financial strategy for compliance but the 
thrift provided no details 
spiegel was paid 56 million in 1987 and 41 million last 
year ms hatch said his pay package as a consultant has not been 
determined and she declined to estimate how much he will make this 
year 
his high salaries have angered federal thrift regulators for 
years as has his amassing of the huge portfolio of junk bonds 
he also is known for his close ties to political figures he set 
up the junk bond investment for former house majority whip tony 
coelho that forced the democrat to resign last may

promus which will own holidays gaming operations and the

the payment of the dividend from promus is subject to approval 
of the transaction by stockholders at a meeting expected in january

limited providing financing for the special dividend 
until recently indications were that financing was available 
on favorable terms to pay a 35pershare dividend said michael
