a woman who admitted killing and 
dismembering her former husband was sentenced monday to eight years 
in prison for the death of the man witnesses said beat her and 
treated her like dirt for 35 years 
a psychologist and psychiatrist testified in washington county 
circuit court that juanita irene stinson 57 suffered from 
batteredwoman syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder 
following years of physical mental and sexual abuse 
two of her daughters testified that their father charles 
william stinson punched and kicked their mother destroyed her 
selfesteem and prevented her from leaving their home countless 
times over the years 
hed wake us up in the middle of the night slapping her around 
the room and beating her said irene fickes 35 of williamsburg 
pa the stinsons oldest child all through the years i begged 
my mother to leave she was afraid of what he would do 
mrs stinson pleaded guilty in april to seconddegree murder 
she admitted fatally shooting 58yearold charles stinson three 
times on may 25 1987 cutting his body into six pieces and burying 
it in a shallow grave near their home 
the two were divorced in the 1950s but lived together as 
husband and wife 
juanita stinson lied about her exhusbands whereabouts for two 
years saying he was on a business trip he installed well cases 
for gas wells and often was gone for months at a time 
she later admitted the killing to an undercover state police 
trooper who posed as a business associate of charles stinson and 
befriended her in early 1988 
washington county circuit judge frederick c wright iii called 
the abuse a tragedy but said taking an individuals life was 
something the court could never condone 
what i see was a determination to kill a determination to 
continue the anger by dismembering the body and a planned scheme or 
charade to cover up death wright said ive heard a lot about 
him that he was not a good person but people who are not good 
people desire to live 
he recommended she be sent to patuxent institution a state 
prison which offers psychological treatment 
juanita stinson who told the judge that she was sorry and that 
she loved her husband walked out of the courtroom surrounded by 
more than two dozen relatives and friends she was ordered to turn 
herself in tuesday morning 
ernest martin of oakland who knew the couple for more than 12 
years said charles stinson treated his wife like a dog 
he treated her like somebody would treat dirt under their 
feet he was mentally cruel to her martin said adding that he 
once saw charles stinson grab her and bruise her arm it looked 
like someone took a paint brush and painted it blue 
dr neil blumberg a forensic psychiatrist testified that the 
abuse gradually eroded juanita stinsons selfconfidence and logic 
leaving her feeling helpless and dependent on him 
he said battered women sometimes strike out and kill their 
abusers after years of tolerating their abuse when a change occurs 
in their relationship for example if the abuse becomes more 
severe or the victim becomes more concerned about her safety 
blumberg said she might have dismembered charles stinsons body 
as a way of making sure that he could never abuse her again 
theres an overkill reaction blumberg said there is a 
perception that the abuser is going to come back and get them 
even though they clearly are no longer alive the very gruesome 
cutting up of the body this was a final way to assure that 
didnt happen

the toll from last weeks killer 
earthquake soared past 1600 tuesday and president corazon aquino 
asked lawmakers for a halfbillion dollars to pay for recovery 
many accused the president of not doing enough to help their 
country rebuild emotionally and physically 
figures from the office of civil defense and the red cross 
showed at least 1621 people were killed when a quake measuring 77 
on the richter scale devastated luzon the main philippine island 
on july 16 official figures monday had listed the death toll at 
1055 but said it was expected to rise 
rescuers continued digging tuesday through the rubble of 
buildings in baguio where more than 370 people died and in remote 
areas of mountainous northern luzon 
defense secretary fidel ramos chairman of the national disaster 
coordinating council said more than 3000 people were seriously 
injured and nearly 90000 homeless 
in a speech monday marking the end of congress summer recess 
mrs aquino rejected proposals to divert foreign debt payments to 
finance recovery 
she thanked foreign rescuers but omitted any reference to an 
american serviceman marine capt michael shannon of ashland ore 
who was killed friday when his plane crashed near baguio on a 
rescue mission 
mrs aquino also did not cite cadets of the philippine military 
academy in baguio who were the first to launch rescue operations 
in that mountain resort following the quake graduates of the 
academy have been at the forefront of the six coup attempts against 
her government 
i should like to thank all of our friends throughout the world 
governments institutions as well as individuals for the 
humanitarian assistance given to our people and the victims of the 
earthquake mrs aquino told congress 
mrs aquino said she would ask the national disaster 
coordinating council who to specifically thank later 
strong aftershocks jolted areas of luzon island again tuesday 
one aftershock monday measured 4 on the richter scale another sent 
hundreds of people rushing into the streets of baguio 130 miles 
north of manila 
during the speech mrs aquino asked for 10 million pesos or 
500 million for the repair and reconstruction of permanent 
structures affected by the recent earthquake the house of 
representatives unanimously approved the request and referred it to 
the senate 
mrs aquino refused to endorse congressional proposals to 
suspend payments on the countrys 26 billion debt to free funds 
for reconstruction 
it is also my hope that congress would share with me the 
concern that any move we take on the manner of debt repayment must 
never jeopardize in any way our painfully built good standing with 
our creditors she said 
progovernment commentators and lawmakers said they were 
surprised at the tone of the speech some considered it lackluster 
several said they expected a rousing call to arms in the wake 
of a major natural disaster 
previous states of the nation addresses were interrupted by 
frequent applauses this time the audience gave perfunctory 
applause only at the beginning and end of the speech 
during a nationally televised commentary after the speech amado 
doronila editor of the progovernment newspaper the manila 
chronicle said mrs aquinos remarks were banal 
the speech had been expected to focus on plans to rebuild areas 
devastated by the quake and to cope with the severe economic and 
social dislocation 
much of the speech however dealt with past accomplishments of 
the government and vague plans for development 
what we wanted to hear but didnt are concrete proposals from 
the cabinet departments on how we are to continue financing our 
earthquake relief and rehabilitation program while also keeping our 
word of honor to our foreign creditors said rep ramon mitra 
speaker of the house of representatives 
in baguio the search for survivors shifted monday to the task 
of recovering the dead british and other foreign experts said 
there were no signs of life in any of the nearly 30 buildings 
devastated by the temblor 
many baguio residents have been sleeping outdoors since the 
quake because of continuing aftershocks more abandoned their homes 
monday morning after a strong aftershock 
seismologists have recorded 629 aftershocks since the quake 55 
of which were strong enough to be felt by the populace 
in manila justice secretary franklin drilon said he was 
establishing a commission to consider criminal charges against 
owners and builders of structures that collapsed during the quake 
on sunday one of mrs aquinos cabinet members acknowledged 
that his construction company built the baguio hyatt a hotel that 
collapsed during the quake but fiorello estuar secretary of 
public works and highways refused to comment on allegations by a 
prominent civil engineer that the hyatt was structurally unsound 
last week octavio kalalo former president of the association 
of structural engineers of the philippines said he warned in 1985 
that the hyatt could not withstand a major quake he said his 
findings were ignored

an electrical problem delayed 
mondays launch of an atlas rocket with a government satellite 
thats supposed to illuminate earths invisible magnetic field 
lines by releasing chemicals in space 
two launch attempts monday were called off after computers 
failed to indicate whether the atlas had switched over to internal 
power the problem apparently lay in a switch that transfers power 
from the ground electrical system to batteries in the atlas 
theyre just going to troubleshoot it and see what the problem 
was said jack isabel spokesman for rocket builder general 
dynamics obviously its always disappointing when you cant 
launch but one of these days everything will go right and well 
have a success 
isabel said nasa wouldnt attempt a launch tuesday and was 
uncertain when the next would be 
throughout the morning there had been concern about 
thunderstorms but the weather improved and would have been fine 
for the scheduled 326 pm liftoff sundays launch attempt was 
postponed by threatening thunderstorms 
the first launch attempt on friday was called off because of a 
helium leak caused by a loose vent duct the entire set of four 
liquid helium vent ducts was replaced saturday 
the commercial atlas 1 rocket was to boost the combined release 
and radiation effects satellite into an elliptical orbit 217 miles 
by 22236 miles high the 189 million satellite is a joint program 
of the national aeronautics and space administration and the 
defense department 
starting this fall the 2ton satellite is to eject 24 canisters 
filled with barium lithium and other chemicals the released 
chemicals will be ionized by the suns ultraviolet rays creating 
large glowing clouds 
the clouds will spread along earths magnetic field lines 
illuminating them in an array of colors visible to the naked eye 
some of the releases will resemble the aurora borealis or the 
northern lights 
the first canisters will be released in september via ground 
signals over american samoa in the south pacific people in north 
america will get their first glimpse of the releases in january 
1991 
additional releases are planned next summer over the caribbean 
florida and the southern portions of alabama and georgia are 
expected to be within sight range 
the satellite originally was to have been deployed by astronauts 
aboard space shuttle challenger in 1987 but the 1986 challenger 
disaster resulted in a lengthy delay and nasa and the air force 
had the satellite redesigned to fit into the commercial atlas 1 
rocket 
the launch will mark the first of a commercial atlas and the 
eighth commercial rocket launch by an american company the san 
diegobased general dynamics space systems division provided the 
65 million rocket and launch services under a barter agreement 
with nasa which gave the company spare atlas parts and ground 
support equipment 
nasa used earlier versions of the atlas to boost planetary 
probes and other midsize payloads 
general dynamics will join mcdonnell douglas and martin marietta 
corp as americas only commercial launch providers mcdonnell 
douglas launched the nations first commercial rocket a delta 
last august martin marietta followed four months later with its 
titan

iraq moved 30000 troops to its border with 
kuwait and the united states ordered its warships in the persian 
gulf on alert the washington post said in tuesday editions 
the reported troop buildup was attributed to unidentified 
western military attaches who were said to have seen 2000 to 
3000 iraqi army vehicles moving south on a northbound trip they 
were allowed to take from kuwait to baghdad the iraqi capital 
kuwait supported iraq during iraqs eightyear war with iran 
but iraq is angry with kuwait because iraq claims kuwaits oil 
production beyond quotas set by the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries is depressing the price on world markets 
the newspaper said the seven us warships in the gulf cancelled 
shore leaves and were told to be ready for sea 
a navy spokeswoman lt betsy jenkins said monday night she had 
no information on the reported alerted 
kuwait whose tanker traffic was threatened by iran appealed to 
the united states for help in 1986 and was given naval escorts for 
some of its tankers put under the us flag 
the nations armed forces are small its army of 16000 
outnumbered by the iraqi force on the border iraq has an estimated 
955000 soldiers in its army 
leaders of various middle east governments have been conferring 
in recent days over iraqs displeasure with kuwait and related 
complaints again the united arab emirates 
iraq claimed kuwait in 1961 six days after britain ended its a 
protectorate over kuwait other arab countries and britain sent 
troops to the iraqikuwait border and iraq did not invade

the credit union is stealing your 
money bureaucrats are pocketing your taxes and a dozen officials 
are extorting kickbacks from your business 
whats an honest venezuelan to do 
he can go to court and pay another bribe or shoot the guilty 
party and risk being shot in return 
if he knows its hopeless but doesnt want to give up in 
silence he can call the publishers of the corruption dictionary 
the new book issued by caracas newspaper publisher carlos 
capriles documents 68 of the most celebrated corruption cases from 
1959 through 1979 the first 20 years of venezuelan democracy 
readers are invited to call in with tales for the next edition 
which will bring the record up to the present 
telling a story of corruption might be expensive since the 
whistleblower often is the first to be punished but at least the 
capriles staff offers a sympathetic ear 
in the corruption dictionary are tales of building contracts 
awarded by public officials to friends who did not even own 
construction companies and of a single building contract let to 42 
different people the contractor in one deal allegedly took off 
for mexico with a 325000 advance 
readers learn of credit union directors who raided workers 
accounts to buy houses and cars for themselves 
what of the immigration office it has long been accused of 
extorting bribes for residency visas the size depending on 
nationality a chinese had to pay 5000 for example but a 
portuguese could get in for 1600 
it is taken for granted in venezuela that the political party in 
power will finance its campaigns with state funds 
the corruption dictionary is 309 pages long compiled from 
newspapers court reports and interviews current events indicate 
there will be plenty of material for volume ii 
in 17 months of the administration of president carlos andres 
perez stories of corrruption have turned up frequently on front 
pages 
there was the case of the theft and misuse of 6 billion in 
government export subsidies 
businessmen were said to have collected subsidies for sending 
empty boxes to miami others it is reported shipped cocaine to 
the united states in tuna fish cans paying expenses with a 
government grant 
people copy their bosses so the dealing also can be found at 
lower levels 
a secretary at a pharmaceutical company was accused of selling 
dozens of men a cure for impotence concocted from flour and water 
bodies were exhumed at a caracas cemetery to make room for new 
customers 
subsidized milk intended for poor schoolchildren was used to 
make cheese sold to restaurants or exported to ecuador peru and 
colombia 
few people are convicted in such cases each new president 
promises a cleanup and perez is no exception but the introduction 
to capriles volume says 
corruption is an underlying structure that feeds and sustains 
the party system and is supported by the economic financial and 
judicial institutions it is also part of our social 
character 
that may help explain why perez has made no visible headway 
despite a long wellpublicized investigation of the import 
subsidy scandal no one has gone to jail 
a court recently ordered 12 prominent people arrested on 
separate charges of corruption all of them including former 
president jaime lusinchis interior minister fled the country 
before the police arrived 
presidents who try to do something are frustrated by an 
unworkable legal system powerless investigating commissions and 
finally by the cynicism of a public inclined to suspect the new 
crowd is the worst of all 
perez himself was implicated in a corruption case during a 
previous presidential term in 19751979 when his administration 
paid 20 million for unusable refrigerator ship 
congress absolved him of responsibility by one vote

the capital of liberia resembles a 
ghost town few people venture into the streets that soldiers loyal 
to president samuel doe rule with the ferocity of men painted into 
a corner 
you just halt when i give you an order a sergeant screamed 
at a passing car saturday pointing his m16 automatic rifle 
straight at the driver 
the car screeched to a halt you a rebel or something the 
sergeant asked with nervous irritation his finger trembling on the 
trigger 
one group of soldiers pounced on a civilian tied his hands 
behind his back and bundled him into a waiting truck he had been 
recognized by one of the soldiers his compatriots said the 
man was savagely beaten but the look on his face showed he didnt 
know why 
the soldiers wearing shabby uniforms were redeyed from lack 
of sleep and heavy drinking many soldiers have sneaked away from 
this rebelencircled capital in civilian clothes hoping to escape 
the final carnage 
but some are caught at rebel roadblocks the rebels look for 
soldiers posing as civilians by checking their shins for marks left 
by army boots 
youths most of them members of does krahn tribe are being 
taken off the streets to be given emergency military training 
as other government soldiers put it 
that means they are issued rifles and ammunition and sent back 
into the street to keep order 
only troops manning their checkpoints in groups of three or four 
are visible along monrovias straight avenues 
at many points cars stand jacked up on bricks their wheels 
missing 
most of monrovias 500000 inhabitants are crowded into their 
houses they strain for a look at what is going on but few wander 
into the open here and there an army patrol fires a volley into 
the air largely to reassure itself 
in street after street all the shops and churches are 
shuttered the windows of many shops are smashed a sign of 
looting government offices are open but empty the staff absent 
doe is barricaded into the executive mansion guarded by an 
elite unit of about 500 soldiers rebels were reported on sunday to 
have advanced to a mile away 
civilians tried to demonstrate for peace a month ago and troops 
opened fire to disperse the crowd 
now people seem to lack the will to take a stand 
everyone is afraid said leonine steward a secretary 
its as though all of us were playing russian roulette with each 
other we dont know who gets the bullet 
the downtown spriggs payne airport is heavily guarded by 
government troops the air charter manager peter seebok recently 
turned away dozens of wouldbe refugees for lack of space 
promising to be back for more the next day but when the next day 
came there were no passengers waiting the troops had taken over 
little if any food has been coming in to the city which is 
also without water electricity and telephone service 
men women and children had been carrying home buckets and 
plastic containers of water from polluted streams now they are no 
longer allowed to go out for water 
all we can do is hope for rain to collect some of it for our 
daily needs said a man employed by an international bank that is 
not functioning 
but our only real hope is for the president to decide to go 
as long as he stays theres no hope for him or for us he said 
about 400000 of liberias 25 million people lived in monrovia 
before the 7monthold insurgency closed in on the capital forcing 
an exodus to the countryside and abroad 
at a private zoo in the city the man who runs it is afraid 
hungry monrovians will try to eat his collection of african 
antelopes called duikers 
swiss taxidermist charles steiner who runs the zoo as a hobby 
gets a small subsidy from the swiss embassy and from private 
companies to feed the animals and keep them from starving to death 
the duikers are crowded into a series of small cages on the edge 
of a swamp a white cross on a red shield tells passersby that 
steiner and his animals are under swiss protection 
the trouble is everyone is very hungry he says god knows 
how long i can save my animals from being eaten 
the great masonic temple located nearby on top of a hill is an 
empty shell its windows are barred and elephant grass grows in its 
onceelegant yard government policy had been made in the building 
before 1980 when liberia was run by the descendants of freed 
american slaves who founded the country in 1847 
the americanliberians called for no apparent reason the 
congo tribe had run the country like european colonialists 
but their rule ended on april 12 1980 when 18 krahn 
noncommissioned officers of the presidential guard stormed the 
executive mansion they killed president william r tolbert and 
divided the cabinet posts among themselves

it was a snapshot of shifting global power a 
beaming mikhail gorbachev and helmut kohl standing together and 
announcing to the world an agreement that put german unification on 
a fast track 
relegated to the sidelines for the moment president bush 
cheered on the soviet and german leaders with backtoback 
telephone calls but the white house was secondary a footnote to 
the days big story 
there is no question that bush has been instrumental in the 
western response to swiftly moving currents in the eastern bloc 
but his longdistance reply to the gorbachevkohl decision last 
week illustrates americas changing role in the world 
after decades of projecting global influence on the strength of 
its nuclear arsenal and economic power the united states is 
struggling to adjust 
americas leadership is still dominant but now it has to be 
based on a bigger variety of factors than just who has the bomb 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said its a greater 
test of leadership to guide events in this climate 
stephen hess a brookings institution fellow said were not 
a hapless giant were an important player but its no longer a 
bipolar world of just the united states and soviet union 
whereas president reagan sought to assert us dominance to 
counter soviet military might bush offers the hand of friendship 
to moscow and strives for accommodation and conciliation with 
restive western allies 
the kremlin long the chief adversary to washington is regarded 
today as more of a welfare case as its warsaw pact crumbles and its 
military muscle fades 
were still no 1 militarily university of virginia 
political scientist larry sabato said the bad news is that it 
doesnt matter as much as it did two or three years ago as the 
importance of the military declines power has got to flow to bonn 
and tokyo in particular 
indeed west germany surging toward unification with east 
germany and a prosperous future and japan basking in great 
wealth are the major rivals to the united states for political and 
economic influence 
while offering words of encouragement to developing democracies 
the united states is restrained by its economic problems tokyo 
replaces washington as the worlds biggest foreign aid donor 
duke university political scientist james david barber assesses 
the united states as a secondary nation rather than as the 
leading champion of democracy in the world 
the president of the united states is not coming forth as a 
person standing for global democracy but rather a person responding 
to south africas nelson mandela to czechoslovakian president 
vaclav havel to soviet president mikhail gorbachev and trying 
to wing it on the basis of the placidity of the american people 
barber said 
after the sevennation summit in london this month americas 
allies spoke comforting words on washingtons global role 
there are three great groups of nations at the summit one 
based on the dollar one based on the yen and one based on the 
deutschemark british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
french president francois mitterrand said i hope america does 
not have the idea they are sort of out of it that is not the case 
the threat from the soviet world has been reduced because of that 
europe can assert its personality 
bush acknowledges that times have changed 
it doesnt work that you have to march in lockstep on all 
these questions bush said were dealing in entirely different 
times 
earlier on in terms of the alliance we had a much more 
formidable military opposition now we see the warsaw pact in 
almost a state of disarray we see troops coming out we see 
democracies replacing totalitarian systems so you have an entirely 
different era bush said 
despite the new environment the white house is determined that 
the united states not appear as a passive player in global 
developments 
after gorbachev dropped his objections to a unified germany in 
nato bush felt it was necessary to offer a detailed explanation of 
how the united states had helped advance german unification 
similarly bush points out that it was the united states that 
charted the new direction adopted by nato at its recent summit the 
administration also credits itself with leading the west toward 
conventional arms cuts in europe and arranging assistance for 
poland hungary and other emerging democracies 
political scientist sabato observed that american power 
doesnt matter as much any more on the other hand which country 
are these newly emerging democracies emulating its the united 
states and thomas jefferson that theyre quoting

his first appointment to the supreme court may 
give president bush an indirect voice on the future of legalized 
abortion in the united states providing bush a supersensitive 
electionyear decision that will reverberate in law and politics 
for years to come 
the retirement of the courts leading liberal justice william 
j brennan will give the court a more conservative bearing 
abortion rights is now the center of attention but the court is 
closely divided on other important social issues such as civil 
rights and criminal justice splitting 54 in numerous cases 
speaking a month before brennans retirement on friday justice 
harry a blackmun predicted the inevitable departure of the courts 
three liberal octogenarians himself brennan and justice thurgood 
marshall would leave conservatives in control for decades to come 
we shouldnt resent it blackmun said thats the way the 
system works that pendulum swings it will stay this way now 40 or 
50 years im sure 
all eyes are on roe vs wade 
there now appear to be four votes chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white antonin scalia and anthony 
m kennedy to overturn the courts 1973 ruling that established a 
constitutional right to abortion 
there also appear to be four votes opposing such a move 
blackmun marshall and justice john paul stevens are strong 
supporters of abortion rights and the generally conservative 
justice sandra day oconnor has refused so far to cast the fifth 
vote to reverse roe vs wade and let states outlaw abortion 
the political stakes are enormous 
republicans took a drubbing in several 1989 elections where 
abortion was a key issue looking ahead to 1992 bush may be 
reluctant to be identified as the president who nudged the court 
into overturning roe vs wade 
the 1990 election year seems pretty sleepy right now but an 
abortion rights debate could ignite plenty of november drama some 
senators were advising bush against any antiabortion litmus 
test for picking brennans successor 
if you have to have someone who wants to overturn roe vs wade 
its going to be a bloodbath getting the nomination confirmed 
senate republican leader bob dole said sunday and the same is 
true on the other side 
georgetown university law professor eleanor holmes norton 
expects the subject to dominate confirmation proceedings you can 
bet your bottom dollar that sitting in the senate are going to be 
men who will insist on bringing out the views of the justice on 
this issue she said 
the presidents announced intention to replace brennan with a 
strict constructionist means a rightwardmoving court will get 
even more conservative 
the impact of brennans leaving because of poor health goes 
beyond the mere loss of a liberal vote and reflects on the 
personal dynamics of the court as a political institution 
combining keen intellect and charismatic charm brennan was a 
master politician and coalition builder who for years blunted 
conservative gains 
part of his behindthescenes persona including using law clerks 
as lobbyists in the offices of his fellow justices and writing 
persuasive memos to fencesitting court members 
in recent years if one or more of the courts conservative 
justices could be attracted to the liberal side of an issue it was 
brennan doing the wooing 
none of the three remaining liberals blackmun marshall or 
stevens can assume that role easily 
no one will fill those shoes said ae dick howard a 
university of virginia law professor 
although less successful against rehnquists conservative 
leadership since 1986 brennan still could claim some victories 
in the 198990 term that ended in june brennan led the court as 
it upheld a federal affirmative action plan giving minorities 
special consideration in awarding television and radio licenses and 
struck down a ban on flagburning both cases were decided by 54 
votes 
the affirmative action ruling surprised and delighted many civil 
rights activists who in recent years have criticized the courts 
decisions making racial and sexual discrimination more difficult to 
prove 
brennan who joined the court in 1956 was a leader of the 
liberal majority that through the 1960s expanded individual rights 
and mandated greater equality for the nations minorities 
but more recently a increasingly conservative court has 
curtailed some of the legal doctrines he fashioned particularly 
those that limited police powers 
brennans successor will join a court now more likely to give 
greater weight to the frustrations of law enforcement officials 
than to the asserted rights of those suspected of crime

republicans are using some unexpected 
expressions to describe their candidate for governor in new york 
words like brainless wonder buffoon and just plain sad 
economist pierre rinfret was the gops lastminute choice to run 
for governor after a host of other prominent republicans refused to 
tackle democratic gov mario cuomo 
but rinfrets outspoken manner has been creating controversy 
ever since he was discovered and recruited by desperate party 
officials in may 
first it turned out he wasnt really a registered republican 
even though he initially insisted he was hes since switched his 
status from independent to republican 
the state gop convention where rinfret was nominated was 
marred by a battle over a prochoice abortion plank in the 
republican platform rinfret was adamant it be kept in and it was 
since the convention rinfret has called for the possible sale 
of the new york city subway system and invited a female albany 
television reporter to his inauguration with the suggestion that 
she leave her husband at home 
he has said cuomo doesnt work at all as governor and was 
chicken for going to college instead of fighting in the korean 
war 
on a visit to washington rinfret and several other republican 
gubernatorial hopefuls had their pictures taken with president bush 
we were like cattle through a chute rinfret reported 
last week rinfret criticized cuomo for having two of his 
children on his campaign payroll 
thats money hes raised for his campaign why is he making it 
a family dole rinfret said adding that his own children work 
for free 
a day later a contrite rinfret sent cuomo a note apologizing 
for the inappropriate remarks 
the gop candidate also has blasted republicans who wouldnt run 
for governor as gutless wonders 
his outspoken manner hasnt gone over well with all gop leaders 
peter king one of those who declined to challenge cuomo 
labeled rinfret the brainless wonder 
sad sad sad said us housing secretary jack kemp 
another who refused to run against cuomo 
mr rinfret has become the national laughingstock of the 1990 
elections said michael long chairman of the new york 
conservative party the conservatives who normally back statewide 
republican tickets have selected their own gubernatorial candidate 
this year 
this guy is incredible one gaffe after another he runs 
around offending people said state assemblyman john cochrane 
the gop leader in long islands suffolk county 
cochrane said he and another state senator met privately with 
rinfret last month to urge him to think ahead about the 
consequences of his remarks 
rinfret insists he got no such advice 
im the gubernatorial candidate he said i havent 
changed im not going to i think the republican party is 
getting very used to me theyre very pleased with me 
last week cuomo reported that 83 million had been raised for 
his reelection bid rinfret said he had raised 870000 of which 
500000 was a loan from himself 
gop consultant roger stone acknowledges cuomo is likely to score 
a big victory in november but stone says the competition rinfret 
is so weak that cuomos victory wont mean much 
i mean who did he beat he beat this buffoon rinfret tough 
stone said last week 
you have a candidate who is obviously highly intelligent but 
who just has no experience at being a candidate and it shows he 
said 
stone said that while rinfrets candidacy is not good for the 
republican party its also not good for cuomo cuomo needs to 
at least make it appear like he beat a credible challenger 
cuomo political aides are insisting that rinfret is part of a 
washingtonbased republican attempt to bloody cuomo before the 
1992 presidential campaign begins they note that bush drug adviser 
william bennett and other allies of the president have attacked 
cuomo during recent stops in new york state 
rinfret is just a rented car rented by bush said veteran 
cuomo political operative william cunningham

theres no way tiny rhode island can be the 
top farm state except in one category average value of farmland 
but thats only one of the 14 categories used by the agriculture 
department to rank states according to their farm characteristics 
texas is no 1 in six of the categories iowa three 
california two and arizona arkansas and rhode island one each 
the rankings by the departments economic research service were 
reported in the agencys july issue of farmline magazine based 
entirely upon statistical numbers relating to values size 
inventories and other factors 
a chart was used to show the placings and analysts prudently 
avoided saying which state was the best most beautiful cleanest 
warmest coldest or anything else 
some of the figures were for 1990 but most reflected economic 
and statistical material for 1989 and 1988 
texas led in the number of farms with 186000 the amount of 
land in farms 132 million acres the total value of farmland and 
buildings 669 billion the number of cattle 136 million the 
number of sheep and lambs 187 million and cash receipts from 
livestock marketings 65 billion 
iowa was first in the amount of land planted to major field 
crops 249 million acres the number of hogs and pigs 14 million 
and the amount of direct federal subsidies paid to farmers 167 
billion 
california led the nation in the amount of cash receipts from 
crop marketings 119 billion and in the amount of net cash 
income from farming 654 billion 
arizona was no 1 in the average size of farms at 4444 acres 
arkansas was tops in broiler production with 920 million birds and 
rhode island was first in the average value of farmland at 5080 
per acre 
because cash receipts from farming are so important to the 
agricultural balance sheet california is often described as the 
top farm state 
with crop receipts at 119 billion and livestock at 47 
billion that put californias total farm marketings at 166 
billion texas the leader in livestock sales of 65 billion had 
crop marketings of 378 billion making a total of about 103 
billion 
the chart showed eight placings in each of the 14 categories 
here are several examples of those ratings in order 
number of farms texas 186000 missouri 108000 iowa 
105000 kentucky 96000 tennessee 91000 minnesota 90000 
ohio 87000 and illinois 86000 
land in farms texas 132 million acres montana 606 million 
kansas 479 million nebraska 471 million new mexico 445 
million south dakota 443 million north dakota 405 million 
and arizona 36 million 
net cash income from farming california 654 billion texas

cattle prices are up this year and so are most 
cuts of beef at the supermarket the government says 
last weeks consumer price index released by the labor 
department for june showed the allcut retail price of choicegrade 
beef at a record of nearly 289 per pound up from 287 in may 
retail beef prices have been setting records since last 
november says the agriculture department prices are expected to 
gain 3 percent to 7 percent in 1990 from last year 
the departments economic research service said 1990 beef output 
will be down slightly from last year due to reduced slaughter of 
nonfed cattle 
choice steer prices are forecast to average 73 to 77 per 
hundredweight this year up from 7252 in 1989 
labors consumer report also showed retail pork prices at more 
than 218 per pound on an allcut basis up about 12 cents from 
may 
the usda forecasts retail pork prices may gain 8 percent to 12 
percent this year compared with the 1989 allcut average of 183 
per pound 
commercial pork production this year is expected to be down 
about 3 percent from 1989 hog prices may average in the mid50s 
per hundredweight up about 11 from last year 
the departments livestock economists said hog farmers have had 
profitability in the hog business since january but that 
producers are expected to take a cautious approach in adding 
breeding stock to their herds 
in previous hog cycles producers began increasing the 
breeding inventory after about six months of sustained positive 
returns the agency said in a recent report the recent run up 
in corn prices and prospects for higher feed costs through most of 
1991 cloud the profit picture 
also the report said lower hog prices in june raise the 
specter of a sharp drop in prices in late summer as production 
increases seasonally

latrines on navy ships and air force planes 
are taking on the look of the executive washroom congressional 
investigators say 
cover assembly for toilets on the air forces c5b transport 
aircraft 1868 urinal for a navy minesweeper 641 rubber 
gaskets to seal drainage holes on airborne toilet systems 6750 
each 
tales of overpriced porcelain and rich rubber are only the 
latest from investigators who uncovered the recent pentagon 
acquisitions of 999 pliers and 117 soap dish covers 
two republican senators charles grassley of iowa and william 
roth of delaware have called for an audit to determine whether the 
overpricing and system problems are as prevalent today as they 
were in the mid1980s 
the pentagons inspector general susan j crawford has 
promised to conduct an investigation 
in the meantime money seems to be going down the toilet 
the government in october 1988 purchased two urinals priced at 
64125 each from a fairfield nj company williams amp watts 
inc according to documents obtained by the associated press from 
investigators 
the purchasing trail for the urinals extended to several 
companies williams amp watts bought the urinals from chamberlain 
manufacturing co gard division of niles ill for 475 apiece 
chamberlain told investigators they purchased the urinals from paul 
supply for 281 paul supply said they paid 150 each to cranefiat 
for the urinals 
investigators who questioned a crane representative on why the 
company does not sell directly to the government was told 
thats how the game is played 
a program manager for williams amp watts said the company examined 
government procurement history files and found that chamberlain is 
the only known and approved source of supply of this product 
scott adler said his company which serves as the dealer for 
chamberlain believed the company was the actual manufacturer 
according to adler chamberlain sought to meet the strict 
military requirements for the urinals which included shock and 
vibration tests the navy also requires that since the urinals will 
be on minesweepers they be nonmagnetic the urinals are made of 
porcelain with brass valves 
adler confirmed that his company paid 475 to chamberlain for 
the urinals and then sold them to the government for 641 a markup 
of 35 percent that included various company expenses 
an official at chamberlain said the person designated to 
comment dr william byrne was unavailable 
investigators also discovered that in 1984 chamberlain sold 
nine of the same urinals directly to the government for 180 each 
the air force purchased the toilet cover assembly a 
steelreinforced plastic sheet that covers the top of the toilet 
for a price of 186815 investigators said 
the cover which is manufactured by weber aircraft is 34 inches 
by 28 inches and two are usually installed on c5b transport 
aircraft 
investigators also found that the government bought four of the 
drain valve seals at a cost of 6750 each for use on airborne 
toilet systems in military aircraft 
the seals are rubber gaskets which are used between a drainage 
hole and the plug which covers it in toilets

organizers of a postcard campaign seeking the 
release of us hostages in lebanon are asking the public to send a 
new wave of cards to the white house in hopes of bringing home the 
remaining six american captives 
the first campaign in which 450000 postcards were mailed to 
president bush was started last year to show the administration 
that the public cares about the hostages and wants them released 
said anne zickl who is running the campaign for the journalists 
committee to free terry anderson 
anderson the associated press chief middle east correspondent 
was taken hostage march 16 1985 he has been held the longest of 
the six americans and 10 hostages from other countries 
zickl said white house statements about the hostages changed 
after the first postcard campaign began 
from that time on the administration has been saying what the 
reagan administration never said that we will talk to anyone to 
bring about the release of these innocent people she said 
we do believe that the heightened awareness across the country 
helped bring about the release of robert polhill and frank 
reed she said 
reed director of the lebanese international school was freed 
april 30 after 3 years in captivity polhill assistant professor 
at beirut university college was held almost 2 years before being 
released april 22 
zickl said the idea for the postcard campaign started with a 
journalist committee member who heard a state department official 
say the american people didnt care about the hostages 
thats not true said zickl 
the american people are not passive on issues of human rights 
if they are informed she said she said that once the campaign 
started getting publicity she couldnt answer the telephone fast 
enough 
i had people call me and say we didnt even know those people 
were still there she said 
the new campaign began july 4 the postcard carries photographs 
of the hostages with the message 
a nation that chooses not to pursue freedom for an innocent 
captive resigns its own freedom those who choose not to listen 
will themselves cry out and never be heard 
a note to bush on the card urges him to intensify his 
administrations efforts to win freedom for the six us hostages 
besides anderson the remaining hostages and dates they were 
kidnapped are thomas sutherland june 9 1985 joseph james 
cicippio sept 12 1986 edward austin tracy oct 21 1986 jesse 
turner and alann steen both jan 24 1987 
the committee include journalists from the broadcast and 
newspaper industry including network anchors and national news 
executives 
the postcards are being distributed by the journalists 
committee at cost 14 for 250 cards and can be ordered by 
calling or writing anne zickl po box 652 batavia ny 14021

when youre bored by batman and 
depressed by the relentless good cheer of the sound of music 
perhaps its time to load the vcr with a tape from the video 
vaults collection of celluloid turkeys 
guaranteed worst movies in town reads a signboard on the 
treeshaded sidewalk outside jim mccabes video store in this 
genteel suburb south of washington dc 
mccabe isnt kidding 
video vault is bmovie heaven an emporium of tinseltown 
disasters a supermarket of film schlock with such titles as 
santa claus conquers the martians i was a zombie for the 
fbi and wrestling women vs the aztec mummy 
here are enshrined the longforgotten relics of republic 
monogram and other lowbudget studios of the 1930s and 1940s where 
there was no retake if an actor flubbed his lines or a boom mike 
suddenly swooped over a lovers embrace 
mccabes inventory of more than 18000 videocassette tapes at 
two locations includes the usual array of new hollywood releases 
the bread and butter of the video rental business but he 
attributes his financial success to video vaults stock of 
hardtofind foreign art films pre1950s classics and cult movie 
atrocities 
he boasts several copies of detour a 1945 film noir which 
mccabe says is probably the most famous b movie ever made 
featuring a cast of three obscure actors it was shot on a 21000 
budget in just six days on two sets a hotel room and the inside 
of an automobile 
there are stomachchurning tworeelers by hg lewis the 
godfather of gore the cult classic reefer madness russ 
meyers mondo topless and other bosomy epics cannibal 
holocaust ilsa harem keeper of the oil sheiks and ed d 
wood jrs night of the ghouls hailed as the ultimate in 
cheap trashy horror films 
wood incidentally is considered the worst director of all time 
and his plan 9 from outer space is a blueribbon staple at 
festivals of the worst movies ever made mccabe said 
wood was dead serious but the guy was so inept that when 
people see his stuff they say my god i cant believe this they 
fall out of their seats and roll on the floor his movies are so 
bad theyre entertaining 
mccabe 40 is a trained psychologist ho suffered burnout after 
seven years of working in the state mental hospital in his native 
columbia sc he moved to washington in 1980 as a reagan 
administration appointee in the education department it was 
zombieland he said 
ive always been a movie buff so five years ago i said what 
the hell lets roll the dice and see what happens mccabe said 
he rented the rear of a converted townhouse in historic alexandria 
and put 500 movie tapes on the shelves 
mccabe spent long hours scouring the fine print of obscure 
distributors and collectors catalogs for the good movies that 
you dont find anywhere else and his business boomed he opened 
a second outlet in washingtons fashionable georgetown neighborhood 
last january and offers mailorder rentals to subscribers in more 
than 40 states and british columbia 
mccabe estimates he will gross more than 1 million this year 
an unusual achievement in a highly competitive industry dominated 
by such giant chains as blockbuster entertainment corp of fort 
lauderdale fla west coast video ltd of philadelphia and erols 
a local firm 
i warn the little guys out there that this a serious game a 
tough business and youve got to find your niche or youll get 
swallowed up by the big guys he said 
mccabe has found his niche you can find it too on the racks 
labeled saturday night sleazies and drivein madness look 
no further than bela lugosi meets a brooklyn gorilla or girl 
on a chain gang 
and dont miss guide to safe sex a compilation of 1940s sex 
education films the one with a couple of grinning bobbysoxers on 
the cover and this warning label dont touch that zipper until

amnesty international called on cameroons 
government today to release two prisoners jailed after trying to 
set up a political party in the oneparty state 
former bar association president yondo mandengue black and 
anicet ekane a company director were sentenced to 3 and 4year 
prison terms by a special military court in april the londonbased 
human rights group said 
their trial was a travesty of justice there was no 
convincing evidence to justify their conviction and details of the 
charges were withheld from the defendants throughout the trial 
amnesty said in a statement 
the two men were among 10 people arrested in feburary and tried 
on charges of subversion and showing contempt for president paul 
biya amnesty said 
it said yondo and ekane were imprisoned and the others were 
given suspended prison sentences or acquitted 
amnesty said the treatment of the men and the unfairness of 
their trial strongly suggests their arrests and convictions were 
politically motivated 
the defendants were illegally detained and held mostly 
incommunicado for several weeks after their arrests the statement 
said two of the men were reportedly tortured it said 
ekane said he had been stripped beaten and forced to remain 
standing without food or water for three days amnesty said 
one of the laywers defending the men was killed by police on the 
last day of the trial and other lawyers received death threats or 
threats against their practices the human rights group said 
the trial itself was described as kafkaesque defendants 
were not given details of the charges they faced and were denied 
time to confer with lawyers or prepare a defense it said 
documents used as evidence against them included two drafts of 
an appeal for signatures in support of political change and a draft 
article for publication by an exiled opposition group amnesty said 
there was no evidence that the documents advocated overthrow of 
the government or that they had been published or distributed the 
statement noted 
amnesty said both the imprisoned men suffer serious health 
problems it said they have little prospect of regular visits from 
relatives who could bring them food and medicine 
amnesty believes the men have been imprisoned solely for their 
nonviolent political activities and are prisoners of conscience

remaining justices of the supreme court 
william rehnquist 65 appointed to the court in 1971 by 
president richard nixon and appointed chief justice by president 
ronald reagan in 1986 once a frequent dissenter he now is 
generally acknowledged as the leader of the courts working 
conservative majority rehnquist is well liked by his colleagues 
who praise him for his informal genial style 
byron r white 73 appointed to the court in 1962 by president 
john kennedy white generally votes with the conservatives 
although his deference to federal power can produce some 
contrasting results he voted with the liberals last month to 
uphold a key federal affirmative action program he is among the 
courts most avid questioners of lawyers during oral arguments and 
can be abrasive 
thurgood marshall 82 appointed to the court in 1967 by 
president lyndon johnson brennans most consistent ally marshall 
is the only black ever named to the court and is a figure of 
historic importance in the civil rights movement but critics say

has been an outspoken critic of reagan and has vowed to remain on 
the court as long as he is alive 
harry a blackmun 81 appointed to the court in 1970 by nixon 
he is best known as the author of the 1973 ruling in roe vs wade

e burger he has cast generally liberal votes in recent years 
john paul stevens 70 appointed to the court in 1975 by 
president gerald ford he is a maverick whose intellectual 
brilliance has been overshadowed by his independence he generally

questioning of lawyers at oral arguments 
sandra day oconnor 60 appointed to the court in 1981 by 
reagan the only woman ever to be a justice she has controlled the 
balance of power until now on abortion issues she also has been a

given to broad pronouncements or sweeping rulings she underwent a 
mastectomy last year and says her cancer has been cured 
antonin scalia 54 appointed to the court in 1986 by reagan a 
scholar and jurist of unquestioned brilliance he has tried to pull 
the court further to the right and has been outspoken in 
criticizing conservative colleagues who prefer incremental change

constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise he 
cast a recent dissenting vote when the court refused to grant child 
abuse suspects the right to confront their young accusers in court 
anthony m kennedy 53 appointed to the court in 1988 by 
reagan the courts newest member solidified a conservative 
majority but says he has felt no special pressure in being a

its high tourist season in santa 
cruz but only on one side of town 
tanned oilslicked bodies adorn the main beach thousands more 
visitors pack the garish amusement parks that line the 1907 
boardwalk 
but just two miles inland the other foremost tourist attraction 
in this city of 50000 has been transformed by the oct 17 
earthquake into a zone of shattered buildings craters and 
scaffolding 
the heart of santa cruz has been ripped out and its not 
being replaced said julie chapton of the oncethriving pacific 
garden mall a district of coffeehouses boutiques and restaurants 
that she frequently visited from her home in scotts valley just 
north of the city 
it tears your heart out when you come down here she said 
officials say it could be anywhere from three years to a decade 
before the sixblock district is rebuilt and booming again 
the northern california quake measuring 72 on the richter 
scale was centered 10 miles from santa cruz which overlooks 
monterey bay nearly half the mall was badly damaged or destroyed 
and three people were killed 
so far the city has tallied 112 million in quake damage 
including 51 million to businesses tourism remains strong but 
visitors are drawn mainly to beach areas largely untouched by the 
quake 
locals who shy away from the touristclogged boardwalk sorely 
miss the treelined mall which was a popular rendezvous 
rebuilding work is taking too long they say 
the citys finance director bob shepherd said reconstruction 
will be slow because the new buildings must meet regulations 
governing quakeproofing he thinks it could be 10 years before the 
district is back on its feet 
the downtown is an absolute wreck shepherd said people 
compare it to hiroshima right after the bomb its really a 
depressing thing 
mental health workers say the rubble can leave passersby 
depressed and anxious project cope a federally funded quake 
counseling group run by the city has treated 16000 people in the 
last eight months said supervisor jill hofmann 
its hard to work in that area because you are constantly 
surrounded by what looks like a war zone she said 
the city has lost about half its yearly 1 million in sales tax 
revenue officials say 
about 100 of the citys 630 businesses never resurfaced after 
the disaster others work out of tentlike plastic pavilions set up 
a block from the mall struggling on sales that are sometimes 25 
percent of prequake levels 
but there are signs of renewal 
the malls palomar hotel should be ready for occupancy by the 
end of the year investors recently bought the mall site of the 
quakeleveled gottschalks department store and a 400car parking 
lot is being built alongside no decision has been made on what 
will be built where the store stood 
the natural treasures gift shop lost about 1500 worth of goods 
in the quake and sales have slumped by more than 50 percent said 
its manager frank morgan 
for the most part i think everybody lost out he said 
but on the other hand were very lucky to be here

a team of eight us and soviet climbers unfurled 
national flags and peace banners atop mount rainier before 
completing sunday the first of four climbs in honor of the goodwill 
games 
the team reached the 14410foot summit at about 10 am 
saturday the day of opening ceremonies in seattle for the 
olympicsstyle athletics competition said bryan rozewski one of 
the american climbers 
the team carried flags from each country goodwill games banners 
and a memorial wreath for 40 soviet climbers who died in an 
avalanche last week on peak lenin in soviet central asia rozewski 
said 
they also unrolled a banner that said peace and its russian 
equivalent mir team members stayed at the summit for about 
seven hours enjoying the view and napping on rocks rozewski said 
they began climbing the states highest peak friday and stayed 
at a base camp 9510 feet up on friday and saturday nights 
it was fun when we got to the top rozewski 28 of seattle 
said from a celebration party there was a lot of energy 
everybody wanted to pick up a flag and wave it 
the climb was led by paul s mckinney 32 of seattle a mount 
rainier veteran who also has scaled the other major peaks in the 
state rozewski said 
other us climbers were david lewis 28 and don mason 32 
both from seattle 
two other americans joined them at the top but were not official 
members of the expedition 
the soviet group was led by andrei rozkov 29 and included alex 
slutjuk 28 vassily elagin 37 and irina miller 35 all of 
moscow 
rozewski said the climb was sponsored by the mir corporation a 
seattlebased firm which organizes ussoviet exchanges and 
profsport a soviet sports organization 
the soviets plan to join other american mountaineers and climb 
three more washington peaks later this week rozewski said 
just hours after the rainier climb was completed the 
mountaineers headed south to the 8364foot mount st helens an 
active volcano that erupted in 1980 that ascent will begin monday 
climbs are also planned for wednesday up 9415foot mount stuart 
and friday up 5979foot mount index two peaks in the cascade 
range 
they want to try and climb all the mountains here they can 
rozewski said 
the visit by the soviet climbers is one of several international 
exchanges being held in conjunction with the games which run 
through aug 5 
rozewski said the soviets are experienced mountaineers while 
most of the american participants were recreational climbers and 
relatively inexperienced 
the americans linked by ropes during much of the expedition 
took about seven hours to complete the final leg of the climb 
while the soviets who climbed separately took only four hours he 
said 
they had more stamina than we did he said

the prairie grass still rustles and the 
buffalo still roam on fred tromps place a momandpop wildlife 
refuge where the public can learn about ancient indians or look at 
native wildflowers 
tromp a retiree with a full head of white hair and thick arms 
muscled from years of work turned his familys farmstead back to 
nature more than 30 years ago charging 250 a head for a visit to 
his little mackinaw wildlife park 
this is my life he said recently as he surveyed the rolling 
hills and the stands of timber where his father and grandfather 
once farmed with horsedrawn equipment i dont smoke or drink 
thats not my entertainment 
the 400acre park 20 miles south of peoria is open on 
saturdays and sundays only tromp 52 commutes to the park from 
his home in nearby pekin for extended stays at a cabin on the land 
if i want entertainment i come out here and mow or build 
fence or fish i love it here and just want to provide something 
for people to come and experience what i do here he said 
tromp a father of seven who runs the park with his wife 
restocked the land with native animals about two dozen bison 
about 40 whitetailed deer and sheep 
the park is tromps way of exposing the curious to swamps 
prehistoric indian culture the beauty of prairie wildflowers and 
the solitude found in the woods 
he let the prairie grasses grow and built a display on indians 
who once lived on the land 
visiting freds park is more interesting than just about 
anything on television said ralph hubbard a regular visitor 
from nearby hopedale 
you get to see a little bit of everything the buffalo wild 
geese deer tourists the buffalo are fascinating and if you look 
around youll probably find some indian artifacts 
the cabin one room with no running water or electricity is 
attached to a gazebo and dock that overlook a pond where ducks and 
canada geese splash and the various wildlife drink 
when the weather is hot and humid the bison sheep and deer 
disappear into the woods and brush making sightings scarce by 
visitors 
to keep them happy tromp walks ahead of guests disappearing 
into the woods for several minutes before reappearing behind a herd 
of bison 
the land is strewn with shards of pottery spear points and 
other artifacts linked by archaeologists to indian tribes that 
lived between 8000 to 10000 bc and ad 600 to 800 
aerial photos tipped scientists to the existence of a mound 
built by prehistoric indians carrying dirt in baskets it is 
unclear whether the site is a burial mound or a location for 
ceremonies 
tromp erected a display at the mound with stone spear tips ax 
heads drills and other artifacts he found during his work on the 
land 
ill spend the rest of my life here i hope he said

the same senate committee that presided over 
conservative robert borks nationally televised ordeal three years 
ago awaits president bushs choice for the latest vacancy on the 
supreme court 
depending on the kind of candidate bush picks the confirmation 
hearings before the senate judiciary committee could be every bit 
as tough 
there is going to be an aboveaverage amount of scrutiny 
because it represents inevitably a shifting in the court said 
sen paul simon dill who played a prominent role in the bork 
hearings in 1987 
bork at the time an appeals court judge failed to win 
confirmation in a vote on the senate floor 
it was in his confirmation hearings before the senate judiciary 
committee however that the former law professor and justice 
department official started running into trouble 
the committee combed his writings for evidence that he was out 
of the mainstream panel members took him to task for matters 
ranging from not doing free legal work for the poor to not finding 
any right to privacy within the constitution 
the latest vacancy occurs as a result of the resignation friday 
of 84yearold justice william j brennan a leading supporter on 
the court of civil rights and individual liberties 
the announcement delighted conservatives and caused concern 
among liberals who have watched the court march steadily toward the 
political right since the start of the reagan administration 
both sides believe bush is likely to nominate a candidate who 
will buttress the courts conservative majority and sap the power 
of the courts swing voters to temper rulings 
the liberal community is going to be upset because they have 
controlled that court for 30 years said sen orrin hatch 
rutah the no 2 republican on the judiciary committee and a bork 
supporter three years ago 
hatch himself was mentioned as a possibility for the court in 
the reagan era but less frequently over the last year 
in any case he says he would rather stay in the senate a 
conservative whose unpredictability at times irks other 
conservatives hatch is guaranteed a major role as the committee 
weighs bushs nominee 
concern about how greatly the nominee would accelerate the 
courts rightward drift is heightened by the emotional issue of 
abortion as well as a host of individual rights questions that the 
justices must resolve 
committee liberals such as sens edward m kennedy dmass and 
howard m metzenbaum dohio are certain to put every detail of 
the candidates legal background and personal character under the 
magnifying glass 
metzenbaum over the weekend reacted to brennans resignation 
by expressing hope bush would nominate someone who everybody 
would agree is not an ideologue not a candidate of the far right 
democrats who have a majority in the senate control the 
judiciary committee with eight votes compared to six for the 
republicans 
two of those democrats however sens dennis deconcini 
dariz and howell heflin dala are from the partys 
conservative wing one of the republicans sen arlen specter 
rpa is a moderate 
in the event of a tugofwar on the committee both sides could 
be expected to go fishing for crossovers 
some conservatives hope bush will nominate someone with views 
calculated to raise the dander of liberals they say a big fight 
would be just the tonic to energize the gops conservative 
followers around the country in time for fall election campaigns 
but no committee members are spoiling for a fight at this stage 
of the game especially with several of them up for reelection 
themselves 
among democrats running for another term is judiciary committee 
chairman joseph r biden jr ddel whose tone was carefully 
neutral over the weekend 
bidens office released a statement in which he expressed hope 
that the president will follow the historic practice of consulting 
with the senate before making his choice 
simon said that he expects the politics of the nomination to 
become entangled in his race for reelection against rep lynn 
martin rill 
but here is something that is infinitely more important than 
an election simon said if the president appoints someone 
who is an ideologue if he appoints a robert bork type then 
inevitably there will be fireworks

having shown once again that its 535 members 
are vulnerable to the same greed and lust that inflict the populace 
that elected it congress now is proceeding to discipline two of 
its own 
the house is considering a reprimand for rep barney frank 
dmass its ethics committee found that frank fixed parking tickets 
for a homosexual male prostitute whom he had hired as a personal 
aide with his own money and gave misleading information about him 
to authorities a house vote is expected this week 
the senate ethics committee proposes denouncement of sen 
dave durenberger rminn for breaking rules on outside income 
evading disclosure requirements and improperly accepting free 
limousine rides senate action is expected within a couple of weeks 
despite the different words reprimand and denouncement 
theres no significant difference between the two chambers 
punishments like almost everything else in congress a large and 
murky vocabulary has evolved to hide the unpleasant choices at hand 
when a member of congress misbehaves house or senate there are 
only three real options do nothing scold the offender or throw 
him or her out 
doing nothing is a popular option for example republican rep 
donald e lukens has been convicted in his home state of ohio for 
having sex with an underage girl the house has not disciplined him 
reprimand and denouncement fall in the middle category 
in each case the chamber approves a document that then gets 
attached to the offender like a scarlet bullseye to be used in 
the next election by his or her opponent 
given the impact on their public images lawmakers are very 
sensitive to the wording of such statements 
durenbergers aides argue to reporters that a denouncement 
is something less than a censure which is the term most 
commonly used in past senate cases it isnt 
in the house though censure is a small halfstep up from 
reprimand the difference being that the offender must actually 
attend and stand in the well of the house and hear the speaker 
recite the punishment 
tears ran down the face of rep dan crane rill when he was 
brought before his colleagues after being censured in the sex 
scandal involving a teenage congressional page he lost his bid for 
reelection 
both chambers are extremely reluctant to expel a member usually 
reserving that punishment for the voters to dish out 
thats already happened with lukens as hes been defeated in 
the ohio primary and it happened in the general election two years 
ago with rep fernand st germain dri the former banking 
committee chairman who was investigated but never charged by the 
ethics committee 
but if the voters want a tainted lawmaker they can have him 
and in some cases they have 
rep gerry studds dmass and rep edward roybal dcalif 
are examples of house members who have retained their house seats 
and considerable power despite being punished studds was censured 
for sex with a male page and roybal was reprimanded for his part in 
an influencepeddling scandal 
its been more than a decade since the house expelled a member 
and the senate is even more reluctant to expel than the house it 
hasnt done so in this century 
it also seems less necessary in the senate 
no senator has been reelected after being censured and though 
the formal punishment may seem light to an outsider the effect 
within the clubby institution is severe 
much more so than the house the senate functions via personal 
relationships and mutual trust earned over the years a censured 
senator becomes a pariah 
one senior senate aide recalled when former sen thomas dodd 
father of the current sen christopher dodd dconn was censured 
for financial misconduct more than two decades ago 
asked how a member of the club could be so punished by his 
colleagues he responded yes we have a club in the senate and 
when a senator misbehaves we eat him 
in dodds day it was a private dinner now with the advent of 
cspan millions of people will watch in their homes as congress 
tries to judge its own

the bush administration saying it has no 
choice under the law has approved importation of some previously 
banned firearms that were modified to get around the ban according 
to a published report 
relying on documents obtained under the freedom of information 
act by the firearms policy project the washington post said 
permission has been granted to import new versions of the uzi 
ak47 galil hk91 and other assault weapons the importation of 
those weapons was prohibited last year 
the paper in mondays editions quoted officials as saying the 
new versions have been altered to remove flash suppressors grenade 
launchers bayonet attachments and other militarystyle features 
that made them unsuitable for sporting purposes 
once the militarystyle features were removed they no longer 
fit the category of semiautomatic assaulttype rifle and the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms had no grounds for keeping 
them out the paper quoted batf spokeswoman dot koester as saying 
however the guns still can accept magazines of up to 30 rounds 
of ammunition and have pistolgrip type stocks that enable them to 
be reloaded quickly 
josh sugarman director of the group that made the documents 
available to the post was quoted as saying those features make 
them every bit as deadly as the banned weapons and makes a 
mockery of last years action 
attempts to obtain a home telephone listing sunday night for ms 
koester were unsuccessful and sugarmans telephone was answered by 
an answering machine

a bipartisan commission says the government 
should help the elderly poor pay medicare charges add coverage of 
preventive services to medicare and order improvements in 
supplementary insurance coverage 
the 28 billion package recommended by the pepper commission 
would add to a 66 billion plan the panel suggested in march that 
would provide health care coverage to nearly all americans 
the panel voted 114 for the latest three recommendations 
people may think that because the elderly have medicare they 
are adequately protected thats wrong sen jay rockefeller 
dwva commission chairman said in the panels sunday 
announcement of the action 
the improvements are desperately needed to assure older 
americans the same minimum standard of protection weve already 
recommended providing americans under 65 he said 
the panel created by congress in 1988 as the us bipartisan 
commission on comprehensive health care includes 12 members of 
congress and three white house appointees it was later renamed to 
honor the late rep claude pepper dfla 
the commissions larger package of proposals in march was 
criticized by some of its own members for failing to recommend 
funding 
in its earlier action the panel split 87 on the plan to 
achieve universal access by requiring businesses to provide private 
health insurance to their workers or to contribute to a public plan 
for employees and nonworking dependents 
at that time panel members also voted 114 for a plan offering 
all americans coverage for longterm care in their homes and for 
the first three months in a nursing home

prime minister lothar de maziere has averted 
the collapse of his broad coalition government with an agreement by 
the governing parties to put off a decision on the precise date of 
german unification 
the social democrats east germanys secondlargest party and 
the smaller liberal centrist alliance had threatened to pull out of 
the government over the issue but reached a compromise on sunday 
the parties have demanded that unity occur a day before 
elections set for dec 2 in that way all of germany not two 
separate nations would vote at once 
but de maizieres christian democrats have said unity before the 
vote would place east germans under a government they did not elect 
the west german government if only for a day 
the coalition partners agreed to have the two german governments 
consult on the issue and try to come up with a solution 
lawmakers did resolve a major difference in the election laws of 
the two germanys by establishing the same 5 percent minimum for 
party representation as exists in west germany 
the law means parties must get at least 5 percent of the vote in 
state and local elections to win seats in councils or legislatures 
the communists successor party the party of democratic 
socialism had pressed for a 3 percent threshold 
de maiziere and his christian democrat allies in west germany 
led by chancellor helmut kohl have favored allowing east germans 
to hold elections for a united parliament on the same day as in the 
west but counting the vote separately in areas that are now part 
of east germany 
this would lower the amount of votes east german parties would 
need for representation in the federal parliament allowing smaller 
parties a chance to get past the 5 percent threshold and win seats 
it would also help the christian democrats who rely more on 
coalitions with smaller parties than the social democrats form a 
legislative majority 
also sunday parliament voted to reconstitute the countrys five 
states that had been dissolved under communist rule 38 years ago 
the move was intended to facilitate east germanys merger with the 
west under terms of bonns constitution 
lawmakers overwhelmingly voted to make oct 14 the date for 
elections in the states of mecklenburg saxony saxonyanhalt 
thueringia and brandenburg as well as in east berlin 
the move restores the five states to roughly their 1946 borders 
and abolishes the 14 districts created by the communists in a 1952 
administrative reform program 
the parliament also passed its last independent budget the 
388 billion budget will have a deficit of about 206 billion 
which will be covered in part by the bonn government and through 
new credit 
east germany merged its economy with west germany on july 1 
experts have predicted that up to half its 8 million workers could 
lose their jobs as formerly statesupported industries lose to free 
market competition

jc franklin gambled and 
lost when he moved three years ago into this floodprone community 
on the banks of the unpredictable brazos river 
as he and other people in southern parker county just west of 
fort worth recover from some of the worst spring flooding in north 
texas this century the dice keep coming up snake eyes 
its wiped us out financially i thought about suicide 
franklin said as he stood in the doorway of his 42000 home that 
was flooded for nine days in late april i have a pretty good 
job my wifes got a pretty good job but were financially 
ruined we dont have enough money to buy our supper 
franklin a 51yearold truck driver spends his weekends 
cleaning up and repairing what he can he hopes to sell the house 
and move to nearby weatherford 
he takes a welltrodden path through the home stopping to sigh 
at a rusted 2200 antique stove before surveying the dirtcovered 
walls of a family room added to the home recently 
we never got a chance to sit in the family room he said 
never had a chance not once to sit in there 
like the franklins thousands of families in the hardesthit 
north and north central texas counties of liberty bowie brown and 
dallas watched the rainswollen brazos trinity and red rivers wash 
away their homes mementoes and chunks of their lives 
the federal emergency management agency has received more than 
6000 disaster assistance applications from 68 texas counties in 
the wake of storms between april 15 and june 4 that claimed 15 
lives and caused millions of dollars in damage 
about 200 parker county families also took advantage of femas 
temporary housing program which provides money for disaster 
victims to rent housing for up to 18 months said graham nance of 
femas disaster aid office 
parker county officials are now working with fema on how to meet 
federal regulations that would make county residents eligible for 
the federal flood insurance program counties must belong to the 
program before its residents can qualify for rebuilding loans from 
fema nance said 
several families in horseshoe bend and the dallas neighborhood 
of rochester park had no flood insurance 
families in rochester park which has flooded for two years 
straight got a boost last week when the city announced it would be 
able to build an 89 million flood levee by november 1991 two 
years ahead of original estimates 
the good news hasnt come often though billie farrington a 
horseshoe bend bartender says she has no big bank account and 
now lives from paycheck to paycheck with friends with no immediate 
plans for the future 
insects fly freely through the broken windows of her home and 
many of the abandoned trailer homes along horseshoe bends comanche 
trail a discolored dirty line along the wall is a reminder of the 
5 feet of water that stood in the trailer for more than a week 
piles of wood mudcaked furniture and clothing still litter 
some lawns even though the community has held two weekend cleanups 
but at least 20 residents including the franklins in this 
community of 400 say its time to clean up and clear out 
id just as soon do anything than to have to leave this 
place franklin said but we cant afford it every time i turn 
around that damn waters coming up and you have to take off from 
work to watch the water so you can evacuate i just cant do it 
though she lost everything ms farrington says shes staying 
put 
its home youve got roots she said this is where i 
want to live till i die

mississippi long the last on most 
education yardsticks has a school reform package that lawmakers 
hope will change all that but finding money for it hasnt been as 
easy as abc 
the package is designed to reduce adult illiteracy and teenage 
pregnancy and lower the number of dropouts but its price tag is 
182 million over three years 
and the prospect of coming up with the money even the 45 
million needed in the first year is bleak especially with 
statewide elections coming up next year 
gov ray mabus wont go along with a tax increase and 
legislators have balked at a package of fee increases and a 
proposal to let voters decide whether the state should start a 
lottery 
mississippi is clearly leading the pack in terms of ideas 
mabus said we have passed the best education reform act in the 
country we just need to go ahead and finish the job 
mabus won election in 1987 on a pledge that mississippi would 
never be last again he has a big job ahead of him 
more than 400000 of the states 25 million residents are 
illiterate the dropout rate is 37 percent giving mississippi one 
of the five highest rates in the nation mississippi students have 
the lowest average scores in the nation on the act the college 
entrance exam mississippi ranks last in spending per student 
in april mabus signed into law his best package short for 
better education for success tomorrow the legislation continued 
reforms begun in 1982 that have helped raise test scores and 
increase accountability by requiring district report cards 
last month the govenor called the legislature into special 
session to find money for the new reforms which include curriculum 
improvements and bonds to replace aging buildings and buses 
proposals to let voters decide if mississippi should have a 
lottery passed the house but failed by five votes in the senate 
during the 13day special session which cost nearly 357000 
now the democratic governor must decide whether to call another 
special session of the democraticcontrolled legislature or wait 
until januarys regular session to try to find funding for best 
were disappointed said andy mullins spokesman for the 
state department of education this was the best shot that weve 
had at getting these programs that are controversial passed in a 
long time 
privately some legislators say mabus put them on the spot just 
before an election year 
youd have to ask them if its me mabus said tell me how 
sad is it and how terrible is it if you want to punish children 
because you happen to dislike a particular individual we ought to 
be better than that 
jim simpson chairman of the house education committee is 
looking to mabus for a little flexibility 
if the legislature funds it i think it will be with a 
broadbased tax increase mutually acceptable to the house and 
senate he said

at least 10000 eastern orthodox christians 
gathered in a lakefront park for a divine liturgy celebrated by 
their highest spiritual leader the archbishop of constantinople 
ecumenical patriarch dimitrios i looked tired but smiled and 
waved as he alighted from a limousine sunday morning to begin a 
twohour outdoor liturgy at the petrillo band shell in grant park 
the service was the first event in a threeday chicago stay by 
the world leader of 180 million to 250 million followers of eastern 
orthodoxy his 27day tour of the united states which concludes 
sunday in boston is the first visit to this continent by anyone in 
his office 
hes like our pope hes the head person in our religion 
and its a big religious event for us said frances halikias 54 
a greek orthodox christian from suburban palos hills 
a steady early morning rain failed to dampen the spirits of 
those who traveled from all over the midwest to see the man they 
consider first among equals in their faith 
christian orthodoxy is largely divided along national lines 
including greeks russians albanians serbians ukrainians and 
others 
for him to come to us is just magnificent said the rev 
james s gordon a spokesman for the greek orthodox diocese of 
chicago its a thrill for everybody here 
the amphitheater where the service was held is located in a park 
between skyscrapers and lake michigan worshipers made the sign of 
the cross as the 75yearold archbishop strode from his car to the 
red and goldcarpeted stage 
there amid six painted icons an altar covered with consecrated 
relics and an ornate pulpit and bishops throne brought from 
greece dimitrios led the liturgy including reading a brief homily 
in greek which was translated into english as he went 
the homily marked a commemoration of mary madgalene and the 
women mourners at christs tomb that is part of the eastern 
orthodox liturgical calendar for this sunday gordon said 
after the homily communion was offered by 30 priests to all 
orthodox christians who wanted it 
the patriarch did not make any remarks about his visit during 
the service but gordon said he was sure the patriarch had to be 
impressed by the number of worshipers who had come o see him 
there are only 2000 orthodox communicants in constantinople 
modernday istanbul turkey now so when he sees easily 7000 or 
8000 people it could be 10000 by now this has got to blow him 
away gordon said 
the service was the largest ever held for orthodox christians in 
the united states according to jim peponis organizer of the 
liturgy for the chicago greek orthodox diocese he estimated the 
crowd at 10000 to 12000 
eastern orthodoxy and roman catholicism split almost 1000 years 
ago over differences in belief about the origin of the holy spirit 
and over the roman popes claim of authority over the eastern 
church the two churches still hold similar beliefs on most points 
however 
six million followers of eastern orthodoxy live in the united 
states including about 250000 in chicago and its suburbs

labor party leader shimon peres has won 
a major political victory over rival yitzhak rabin who attempted 
to force immediate elections for party chief 
i fell in love with my party again peres said sunday after 
he won a battle in the partys policymaking body to postpone until 
next year a vote on the party chairman post 
the party and the country shall benefit from this victory 
he said 
labors 1400member central committee was called into session 
to consider demands by rabin labors no 2 man for a vote soon on 
the chairman post 
according to official results about 54 percent of the 1212 
labor members present supported peres and decided to postpone the 
election 
peres a former prime minister had argued that the centerleft 
party should prepare for a battle with the rival likud bloc and 
deal with internal struggles later 
just before official results of the vote were announced at the 
end of the sevenhour meeting dancing and singing supporters 
surrounded peres and many kissed and hugged him 
rabin has been maneuvering to oust peres since may when peres 
failed to form a laborled government after bringing down a shaky 
coalition with likud 
the failure enabled likud leader prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to form his rightwing cabinet in early june 
i accept the majority decision rabin said after the vote 
i thank the great number of central committee members who saw the 
need for a change but the majority decides i believe that from 
now on the party should be united and organize itself as an 
opposition confronting likud 
peres and rabin then briefly shook hands 
peres who has been party chief since 1977 said later that he 
would not seek revenge 
there is room for everyone for yitzhak rabin and others he 
said on an interview on israel radio 
although rabin and peres both appealed for party unity 
observers predicted that labor will remain split and unable to 
present a strong opposition 
we will see two organized and hostile camps with leaders who 
hardly speak with each other a kind of prolonged war of 
attrition said israel radios political observer hanan cristal 
likud may forget about opposition it will have an easy life in 
the government 
mordechai gur a senior labor member and a rabin supporter said 
peres victory had weakened the party 
we thought we should change the leadership to lead a strong 
active opposition with peres it would be very difficult we shall 
do our best but im afraid it would not be as strong as it could 
have been gur said 
recent polls have consistantly indicated that rabin 68 is 
israels most popular leader 
also a former prime minister he gained popularity for his tough 
stance as defense minister in the last government in dealing with 
the 31monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied territories 
he also is remembered as chief of staff in the 1967 middle east 
war when israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza 
strip from egypt 
by contrast the popularity of the polishborn peres who turns 
67 in 10 days has been on the decline

some scientists suspect the measuring 
instruments made and used by a connecticut company to create the 
hubble space telescopes two mirrors were faulty or improperly 
used a newspaper reported 
the hartford courant said several scientists familiar with the 
hubble project are focusing on the optical devices used to guide 
the grinding and polishing of the mirrors as the root of the 
focusing problems 
because of the mirror problem the 15 billion orbiting 
observatory cannot properly focus the light from distant stars as 
it orbits 380 miles above the earth about half of its astronomical 
research must be delayed until a solution is found 
the mirrors a 945inch primary mirror and a 125inch 
secondary mirror were made by perkinelmer corp at its danbury 
division which it sold last year to hughes aircraft co 
hughes danbury optical systems inc officials agree there is a 
problem with one mirror but are not convinced the company is 
responsible said hughes spokesman thomas j arconti 
from day one people have been attempting to lay blame 
arconti said that is just much too early 
the instruments which are called null correctors also were 
used to test the finished mirrors on the hubble 
daniel schulte of lockheeds palo alto calif research labs a 
member of a nasa committee assigned to find ways to correct the 
hubbles focusing problem told the newspaper he is certain there 
was something wrong with a null corrector 
schulte said other committee members support his theory the 
courant said other scientists who spoke on condition of anonymity 
also agreed the problem was in the null correctors 
the national aeronautics and space administration and other 
scientists believe the hubbles flaw is most likely in the larger 
mirror 
schulte said he has ruled out the possibility of a problem with 
the design of the null corrector for the primary mirror and 
concluded the problem had to be in the manufacture or assembly of 
the null corrector 
if the null corrector is correct the mirror would be 
correct said daniel schroeder a nasa telescope scientist who 
helped oversee the hubble project and is chairman of the physics 
and astronomy department at beloit college in wisconsin 
abe offner a retired scientist who designed the null system in 
the 1970s for perkinelmer said it was almost certain the null 
corrector was flawed 
offner is among several scientists due to meet wednesday and 
thursday in danbury with a sixmember nasa team investigating the 
hubbles flaw there are other possibilities to explain problems 
with the telescope but they are kind of farfetched he said 
investigators have not yet tested the null correctors the 
newspaper said

bong jae jang rises before dawn and goes to the 
brooklyn terminal market where he stocks up on green plantain 
haitian mangos and other produce popular with the caribbean 
immigrants who used to shop at his store 
these days jangs trip is an academic exercise he knows most 
of the fruits and vegetables will sit unsold on the shelf rot in 
the july heat and wind up in the trash bin outside 
whos going to buy this he asks holding up a 
cellophanewrapped hunk of a vegetable called pium kim that is 
besieged by a swarm of tiny flies 
after six months a blackled boycott of jangs greengrocery 
continues even though the television cameras are gone and the 
pickets who gather outside the front door each afternoon have 
dwindled to a handful 
the boycotters avowed aim is to force the store to close 
jangs business is sustained largely by 5000 to 7000 a month 
in donations from the citys other korean grocers they will 
support him until the boycott is over says michael kang of the 
korean produce association he is their maginot line they think 
theyre going to be next 
jangs troubles began jan 18 when giselaine felissaint a 
haitian immigrant got into an argument with several of his 
employees over some merchandise one of them touched her she says 
the man knocked her down another employee says the man put his 
hands on her and she laid down 
it would be five months before the manager of the store pong ok 
jang was charged with assault but the incident immediately became 
a symbol of the tensions between the citys black and korean 
communities 
within a few months hundreds of demonstrators were gathering 
outside the store each day along with almost as many police and 
journalists pickets yelled racial slurs at the koreans and urged 
them to go back to where you came from 
the problem went far beyond a simple assault charge many blacks 
resent the way they are treated in some of the korean grocery 
stores that have opened in their communities and some are jealous 
of the immigrants business success the selfemployed account for 
67 percent of all city workers but only 34 percent of black ones 
skeptics derided the boycott as a news media creation that would 
end as soon as the last camera crew departed they were wrong by 5 
pm there are usually about a dozen demonstrators behind the blue 
police barricades that line the sidewalk outside the store in the 
flatbush neighborhood few local residents defy their cries of 
boycott 
the stores have become a symbol of what has happened across 
this city in terms of the lack of recognizing the humanity of black 
people says george dames a spokesman for the flatbush coalition 
for economic empowerment a boycott group it was not an isolated 
incident 
since may however tensions there have been lessening if not 
dramatically then incrementally says lonnie soury spokesman 
for the citys human rights commission 
mayor david dinkins has appointed a factfinding panel and 
called for an end to the boycott but none seems likely soon there 
still have been no direct negotiations between the korean and 
haitian communities let alone jang and mrs felissaint she has 
refused to denounce the boycott and has filed a 6 million suit 
against the store 
according to a poll taken last month only 13 percent of new 
yorkers support the boycott while 58 percent support the koreans 
among blacks only 27 percent sympathize with the boycotters while 
37 percent side with the koreans boycott leaders say this simply 
reflects biased news coverage 
jang 35 says he came here in 1983 and worked for five years at 
another store before opening his own he says that before the 
boycott he routinely worked 17 hours a day and was robbed three 
times he shows off the scar where a robbers bullet entered his 
abdomen last year 
jang says neither dinkins nor police commissioner lee brown 
wants to stand up to the boycotters and pass responsibility for 
dealing with them back and forth he does not speak english very 
clearly but he gets his point across they play a pingpong 
game they killing my dream 
to soury the boycott is a tragedy two immigrant groups are 
pitted against each other when they should be fighting together to 
demand more government aid for small businesses for blacks and 
koreans and everyone else

officials in mongola began tabulating results 
today of the first multiparty elections ever held in the worlds 
secondoldest communist state after the soviet union 
voters turned out across the asian nations 600000 square miles 
of grasslands and steppe on sunday for a primary involving 2400 
candidates for the national legislature or great peoples hural 
the balloting was to reduce the field to 860 candidates two for 
every seat in the hural the runoff is scheduled for next sunday 
a source in the capital ulan bator visited 10 polling stations 
in the city and described the voting as very well organized 
the voters appeared to have a lot of confidence in the voting 
they seemed enthusiastic about having a choice this time said 
the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said results would be announced at a news conference tonight 
sundays elections made mongolia the latest sovietbloc nation 
to move toward multiparty democracy following a huge outpouring of 
prodemocracy sentiment during street demonstrations last winter 
mongolians were given the choice of voting for candidates from 
the ruling communist party known as the mongolian peoples 
revolutionary party or from one of five new opposition parties 
the opposition parties were formed following weeks of rallies 
for reform that forced former president and communist party chief 
jambyn batmonh from power last spring 
the communists known as the mongolian peoples revolutionary 
party and the opposition parties all say their next step will be 
marketstyle economic reforms 
only 300 of the candidates in the primary are members of the 
noncommunist parties together they have 15000 members compared 
with the communist partys 90000 
the ruling party is almost certain to win a majority in the 
430seat great peoples hural because one seat is being allocated 
for every 2000 rural residents compared with one seat per 10000 
urban residents 
most of the support for the noncommunist parties is among 
educated urban residents but the communists remain strong in rural 
areas 
the opposition parties however hope to win a strong majority 
in the 53seat small hural which was newly created to replace the 
current standing committee of the great peoples hural 
the small hural will meet yearround and hold most governmental 
power however the great hural still will elect a new president 
the incumbent punsalmaagiin ochirbat was elected by the outgoing 
great hural in april 
the small hural originally was to have been elected by the great 
hural but under pressure from the opposition the government 
agreed to allocate small hural seats according to the percentage of 
votes each party receives 
the communists made more concessions last month after the 
opposition parties threatened to pull out of the election 
the ruling party agreed to allow opposition participation in 
local election commissions which count ballots and to allow 
international observers to monitor the election the communists 
also gave each party state funds for campaigning and suspended 
party cells in the army and state security forces during the 
campaign and balloting 
foreign observers in ulan bator include a team of british 
parliamentarians 
mongolia has been ruled by the communists since 1921 when a 
small band of revolutionaries aided by soviet troops drove out the 
chinese who had controlled mongolia since 1691 china retained 
southern mongolia called inner mongolia where mongolian tribal 
princes had formed alliances with the chinese

cambodias vietnameseinstalled 
government today reported fierce fighting in a mountainous central 
province that it said khmer rouge guerrillas were trying to seize 
the enemy is attempting by all means to seize control of 
kompong thom the official spk news agency quoted the chief 
provincial administrator khieu horl as saying 
khieu horl showed heaps of firearms ammunition and other 
materiel recently captured from the guerrillas said the report 
who was monitored in bangkok he said about 800 khmer rouge 
guerrillas struck from all directions on june 17 but were repulsed 
in fighting that killed 112 guerrillas 
government col hang thol was quoted as saying the guerrillas 
have intensified attacks since a last months agreement in tokyo to 
arrange a truce and have played havoc with any place they 
infiltrated into 
the khmer rouge did not sign the tokyo agreement 
the spk report said the khmer rouge infiltrated through the many 
rivers crossing the province 
claims of military successes by the government and the khmer 
rouge both communist are treated with skepticism but other 
sources have confirmed heavy fighting in kompong thom which 
previously was largely spared in the 11yearold war as fighting 
focused on western areas bordering thailand 
the khmer rouge and noncommunist guerrillas loyal to prince 
norodom sihanouk have seized wide areas of the province in recent 
months sihanouks fighters also briefly penetrated the provincial 
capital also called kompong thom said an associated press 
correspondent who visited the area 
the khmer rouge radio said saturday it was preparing a new 
attack on the provincial capital about 75 miles north of phnom 
penh 
it said that on july 12 and 13 537 of its civilian supporters 
including youths voluntarily portered weapons ammunition and 
food to guerrillas readying for the attack 
the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of thousands of people 
when in power in the 1970s is allied in a guerrilla coalition with 
the forces of sihanouk and of the khmer peoples national 
liberation front vietnam installed the current government in phnom 
penh after invading in late 1978 
a us policy shift announced wednesday has increased fears that 
the khmer rouge will escalate the fighting because of its 
international isolation the united states citing its opposition 
to the khmer rouge said it was withdrawing recognition of the 
coalitions seat at the united nations in order to open talks with 
vietnam on ending the cambodian war 
the spk agency on saturday urged the khmer rouge and its main 
source of arms china to return to talks on arranging the 
ceasefire 
sihanouk and phnom penhs prime minister hun sen signed on june 
5 in tokyo the agreement calling for a truce but the khmer rouge 
boycotted the talks after complaining it was not being treated as 
an equal 
china later said it did not support the agreement

the dismemberment of an environmentalist 
soliciting donations in a rural neighborhood has raised concerns 
about the safety of canvassers nationwide 
james michael madden 24 of whitefish bay was last seen june 27 
going door to door in rural racine county to enlist support and 
solicit funds for citizens for a better environment 
on june 29 his remains minus the head and arms were found in 
plastic bags by a farmhand near a road the missing body parts were 
found last week about five miles from where the torso was 
discovered 
no arrests have been made and the investigation is continuing 
detectives say they believe madden met a psychotic killer and his 
death was not related to the political slant of his work 
but groups that hire canvassers say the slaying has raised 
interest in improving safety precautions including selfdefense 
training for their thousands of employees 
it happened once and it could happen again said gordon 
white canvass director for the environmental group greenpeaces 
new york chapter we want to play it safe and be prepared given 
the possibility something like this might reoccur 
whites office is one of 29 greenpeace offices nationwide that 
employ up to 1000 canvassers during the summer many are college 
students looking for summer jobs 
white who coordinates 50 canvassers in the new york city area 
said his office is scheduling a series of safety courses involving 
selfdefense and nonviolent training 
because of the heightened awareness we wanted to take care of 
the concerns about safety he said 
some canvassers say such efforts should become routine 
you go canvassing you go into a different neighborhood meet 
50 to 150 people you have never met in your life and will probably 
never see again then youre going to have a greater likelihood of 
running into these nuts said former canvasser tom oates 32 of 
washington dc

shorter skirts than ever and plenty of lush fabrics 
appear to be the main themes for next winters lines of haute 
couture 
christian lacroix opened a week of fashion shows sunday with a 
stunning display of exotica and opulent fabrics refining his line 
with some superb jackets and trapeze coats furtrimmed velvet and 
gilded brocade 
a goldshot raspberry tweed suit with bold rhinestone buttons 
seemed to please ivana trump who is staying at the famed ritz 
hotel she beamed througout lacroixs show 
like the other main houses lacroix is ready to lengthen the 
short styles on the runway for a rich client who decides 10000 is 
too much for a bathingsuit length cocktail dress 
the cheery designer from southern france looked somewhat pale as 
he took a bow to enthusiastic applause but after two back 
operations several months ago and a lawsuit brought by his former 
employer patou he says hes still in fine shape 
the lacroix exuberance occasionally flounces out in too many 
details such as layer on layer of lace or yet another bustle but 
most of his fitted clothes were splendid 
so were the adornments sparkly buttons sable cuffs detailed 
embroidery and heavymetal jeweling straight from byzantium even 
boots were jeweled giving the slightly 1960s silhouettes new 
lavishness 
i get my inspiration from all over said lacroix 
another dream world for rich fashion devotees was turned out by 
hanae mori the japanese couturiere who won the legion of honor 
last year also is the only japanese officially accepted as a 
member of the french haute couture group the chambre syndicale 
mori was awarded a delicate white rose in her name at the parc 
de bagatelle a few weeks ago the french have honored many famous 
women including barbara bush by naming a rose after them 
at her show mori concentrated on exquisite drapes and flowers 
as a theme for her dressier clothes her rosefastened satin gowns 
with draping and sparkling embroidery were luscious for debutantes 
or women a bit older 
mori did some wonderful short suits in smooth wools 
easilyfitted with flaring long peplum jackets and luxuriant short 
cashmere or smoothwool capes in colors raspberry or mustard 
but her showstoppers were the slithery sequined gowns 
embroidered to look like van gogh paintings with all the swirls 
and cypresses right out of the arles masterpieces 
meanwhile italian gianni versace threw a splashy party in the 
ritz gardens saturday night following his show the guest of honor 
was sylvester stallone 
the big idea was an array of print mixes and sparkly embroidery 
in the shortest outfits possible 
his dots checks and 1960sstyle graphics for the sheer fun of 
it drew kudos and he showed some new pleated and draped looks he 
says were inspired by leonardo da vincis paintings 
among the sprouting new talent dutchborn paul b elsen 27 
gave a promising offering of truly couturefinished styles he 
reportedly sewed all 32 garments himself 
his long fitted redingotestyle jackets with their jaunty 
riders top hats were well made as were some of the terrific pants 
suits often with an interesting bolero flared with sharp pleats at 
the back 
to amuse the jaded fashion crowd and launch a new watch 
collection called mademoiselle the chanel company is opening

shiite moslem factions rushed 
reinforcements to an embattled mountaintop town in southern lebanon 
today and thousands of villagers trekked out of the region fearing 
escalated warfare 
police observed a marked decrease of fighting after eight days 
of ferocious battles between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party 
of god and the syrianbacked amal militia around the hilltop town 
of jarjou 
they said one combatant was killed and two other amal militiamen 
wounded in sporadic exchanges of artillery and sniper fire near 
israels selfdesignated security zone inside lebanon 
police said the dead fighter was a syrian belonging to the 
damascusbased baath party fighting with amal 
the monday casualties raised the toll to 126 people killed and 
369 wounded since the latest round in the intermittant threeyear 
amalhezbollah confrontation broke out july 16 
by police count at least 1167 people have been killed and 
4011 wounded in the power struggle for control of lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest sect 
palestinian guerrillas stationed between amal and hezbollah in 
the disputed region took up four new hilltop positions west of 
jarjou on sunday 
the palestinian force is now capable of preventing any advance 
from either side said lt col anwar madi commander of the plo 
intervention force as he checked on his guerrillas at jarjou today 
police said dozens of truckloads of ammunition and jeeps 
carrying amal militiamen were sent to the militias positions 
around jarjou during the night amal has fielded about 6500 
frontline fighters 
they said hezbollah set up several additional artillery and 
mortar batteries in jarjou the fundamentalist group has an 
estimated 2000strong force in the iqlim altuffah or apple 
province 
the arrival of reinforcements panicked the regions remaining 
inhabitants 
long lines of fleeing villagers trudged through the rugged hills 
of the province carrying household necessities under their arms 
and on their heads 
most of them sought refuge in southern lebanons major cities of 
sidon tyre and nabatiyeh 
others fled to open fields sleeping at night in cars 
jarjou is almost completely deserted with a few people and 
many hezbollah fighters there said one refugee who spoke on 
condition his name not be published 
the town has been turned into a pile of debris he said 
police estimated that no more than 50 elderly people of jarjous 
original 5000 inhabitants remained in the town 
about 50000 people fled the apple province since the clashes 
broke out last week hezbollah appealed to the international 
committee of the red cross to remove corpses decomposing under a 
blazing sun in jarjou and pledged to facilitate the humanitarian 
mission 
the fighting erupted last monday when hezbollah attacked and 
seized jarjou an amal stronghold seeking to expand its area of 
control as far as the mediterranean coast to open a badly needed 
supply line 
a 600member palestinian force drawn mainly from plo chairman 
yasser arafats mainstream fatah group was deployed tuesday along 
a 7milelong line ostensibly to stop the fighting 
amal militiamen supported by the palestinians retook jarjou in 
ferocious battles on saturday but the fundamentalists drove the 
more secular amal out of town to the western entrance of jarjou in 
closequarter combat sunday 
the plo fears if hezbollah expands from jarjou to the 
mediterranean they might link up with antiarafat palestinian 
radicals and threaten the plo bases in refugee camps near the port 
of sidon 10 miles northwest of jarjou

strong aftershocks rocked this 
mountain city today sending residents fleeing into the streets and 
hampering the search for victims of last weeks earthquake the 
death toll surpassed 1000 
in manila president corazon aquino urged congress to approve a 
500 million relief package to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by 
last mondays quake which measured 77 on the richter scale 
mrs aquino made the call in a 55minute state of the nation 
speech that television commentators said was surprisingly 
lackluster 
also today rep rolando andaya chairman of the house 
appropriations committee said he would pursue proposals to suspend 
debt payments for two years to free funds to rebuild 
mrs aquino has warned that any unilateral reduction in debt 
payments could worsen the countrys economic plight by prompting 
international lenders to reduce the flow of new money 
in baguio the search for survivors shifted to the task of 
recovering the dead british and other foreign experts declared 
there were no signs of life in any of the nearly 30 buildings 
devastated by the temblor 
official figures put the death toll at 1055 but it was 
expected to rise 
more than 200 bodies are believed still buried in rubble 
defense secretary fidel ramos chairman of the national disaster 
coordinating council said more than 3000 people were severely 
injured in the quake and more than 700 were missing ramos said 
nearly 90000 people were homeless 
british volunteers abandoned the search for survivors after 
failing to find signs of life in the hyatt hotel the last area of 
baguio where experts believed there might still be survivors of the 
quake 
hopes that some people were still alive at the hyatt faded after 
rescuers no longer heard tapping sounds on walls near the hotel 
basement rescuers said the last of the survivors probably died 
after aftershocks shifted the rubble either crushing them or 
depriving them of air 
more aftershocks jolted baguio today including one about 945 
am that sent hundreds of people fleeing into the streets many 
baguio residents have been sleeping outdoors since the quake 
because of continuing aftershocks 
on sunday one of mrs aquinos cabinet members acknowledged 
that his construction firm built the baguio hyatt 15 years ago but 
he refused to comment on allegations by a prominent civil engineer 
that the building was structurally unsound 
there are many factors to consider before you can pinpoint 
where the fault lies said fiorello estuar secretary of the 
department of public works and highways 
last week octavio kalalo former president of the association 
of structural engineers of the philippines said he inspected the 
hyatt in 1985 and warned that the building could suffer serious 
damage in an earthquake because it was structurally unsound but he 
said the warning went unheeded 
in manila justice secretary franklin drilon said he would 
launch an investigation into possible criminal liability of 
builders and owners of buildings that collapsed here and in 
cabanatuan during the quake 
jose de jesus presidential relief coordinator said 373 people 
were killed in baguio alone and another 175 in the surrounding 
province of benguet 
he said 135 people were believed trapped inside eight factories 
in baguio but all were believed dead 
de jesus said information on deaths and damage was still 
trickling in from remote areas including nueva vizcaya province 
where many villages and roads were buried by landslides 
philippine pilots who surveyed the areas saw masses of survivors 
walking over the mountains to safety the pilots described them as 
looking like columns of ants silhouetted against the barren 
mountain slopes

opposition lawmakers resigned en masse 
today demanding new elections and accusing president roh taewoo 
of using sensitive interkorea issues to divert attention from 
pressing domestic problems 
the resignations of all 79 opposition members in the 299member 
national assembly could throw the country into political crisis as 
it prepares for the first meeting ever between the prime ministers 
of north and south korea 
the roh government announced today that it was willing to 
negotiate with the communist north on conditions the north is 
setting for opening the border between the koreas to travelers 
in a dramatic speech on friday roh proposed that the common 
border be opened for five days in august on a trial basis allowing 
people on both sides free travel he said open borders could lead 
talks on unification 
but north korea demanded that south korea scrap its 
anticommunist national security laws release prisoners jailed for 
promoting unification and allow south korean dissidents to attend 
an aug 15 border rally sponsored by north korea 
north korea today proposed expanded highlevel talks among 
government and political leaders of the two sides friday north 
koreas official korean central news agency monitored in tokyo 
reported the proposal 
longtime observers view the border talks as part of a continuing 
sporadic dialogue between rivals mutual distrust has blocked any 
real progress in prior talks 
three south korean cabinet ministers said seoul is willing to 
negotiate conditions set by the north and also suggested the two 
sides meet on friday 
in order to open the border and realize grand national 
exchanges we are ready to discuss any problems related to it 
unification minister hong sungchul said on national radio and 
television 
hong and other cabinet ministers said north korea has a number 
of barriers to free travel and a poor human rights record 
justice minister lee jongnam cited reports by international 
human rights groups that north korea is holding 152000 political 
prisoners at 12 concentration camps he also noted that the norths 
constitution makes communization of the south the countrys top 
goal 
the heavily fortified border is tightly sealed and more than 
15 million troops are stationed on either side behind bunkers and 
barbed wire there is no mail travel or other communication 
between the nations 
kim daejung head of the leading opposition party for peace and 
democracy said his party welcomed efforts for border openings with 
north korea but he said roh should not use the issue to bolster 
what he called sagging support for the governing democratic liberal 
party 
the mass resignations from parliament included 71 members of 
kims party and eight members from the splinter democratic party 
the legislators cleaned out their offices and said they and 
their staffs would refuse further government paychecks as of today 
they said they would not return unless the governing party 
agrees to discuss their demands including new elections they also 
want 26 controversial bills that were pushed through the 
legislature at a special session earlier this month returned to 
committee 
rohs party was a minority party in parliament until it merged 
in january with two smaller groups giving it a twothirds 
majority the opposition says the legislatures makeup no longer 
reflects the wishes of voters and new elections must be held 
the governing party said the resignations would not be 
immediately accepted under korean law the speaker can refuse to 
accept the resignations until the next parliamentary session in 
september when they would be voted upon opposition lawmakers 
said they considered themselves finished with parliament 
regardless of how the resignations are dealt with 
on saturday antigovernment protesters clashed with police 
after a huge opposition rally that attracted an estimated 300000 
people fighting broke out when riot police firing tear gas blocked 
a column of about 20000 radical students chanting antigovernment 
slogans 
police said 195 protesters were arrested there were no reports 
of injuries 
the rally had been called to celebrate talks to unify the two 
opposition parties with a nationwide dissident group by september 
the korean peninsula was divided into the prowestern south and 
communist north at the end of world war ii the nations fought the 
korean war from 1950 to 1953 and are technically still at war 
because no peace treaty was signed

a us military team goes to cambodia 
on tuesday to examine what may be the remains of americans missing 
from the war in indochina a spokesman said 
it will be the first such mission since the 1975 communist 
takeover in cambodia 
the united states does not recognize the vietnameseinstalled 
phnom penh government and has supported guerrillas fighting for its 
overthrow 
but wednesday the united states announced it was withdrawing 
recognition of the guerrilla coalition and would open talks with 
vietnam on ending the cambodian war 
the sixman team leaves from bangkok aboard a us air force 
plane and will stay overnight in phnom penh said team spokesman 
lt col thomas boyd 
he said if the remains are identified as those of americans a 
17member team will fly to cambodia on thursday to take the remains 
to hawaii 
boyd would not say how many sets of remains will be examined at 
least 82 us servicemen are listed as missing in action in 
cambodia he said 
us officials have also said there are at least eight civilians 
reported missing in cambodia including four journalists two 
contractors a merchant seaman and a missionary 
most american servicemen missing in cambodia are airmen us 
airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973 
earlier this month john gunther dean the last us ambassador 
to cambodia made a sixday visit to phnom penh his first since 
carrying out the us flag out in 1975 
the us severed relations with cambodia in 1975 after communist 
khmer rouge guerrillas seized power during their four year rule 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people as they 
tried to implement radical agrarian reforms 
phnom penh said in 1984 it was willing to cooperate on the issue 
of missing americans and declared in 1988 that it was willing to 
hand over remains but the repatriations have been delayed by the 
diplomatic stalemate 
cambodias premier hun sen was quoted as saying in february 
1989 that his government had eight sets of american remains and was 
searching for more 
last month the cambodian government said it had set up a 
fiveman commission led by a deputy minister to help search for the 
remains of us servicemen 
there are 2353 americans missing from the war in indochina the 
largest number 1719 are missing in vietnam

a chess expert drawing inspiration from sherlock 
holmes and lewis carroll said today he believes he has cracked a 
puzzle that could lead to the whereabouts of a woman missing since 
january 
police believe the woman is buried somewhere in ireland and the 
chess experts work would appear to reinforce these views 
detective superintendent roy fletcher of lancashire police said 
the puzzle drawn by a man arrested in connection with the case 
is a crude map and a series of moves for a black king a black 
queen a black pawn and white king all pawns 
raymond keene chess correspondent of the times of london and an 
international grand master said the puzzles author shows 
tremendous intellectual arrogance allied with a perverted 
ingenuity and rooted in the belief that he can dangle all sorts of 
intellectual clues in front of the polices nose without their 
being able to solve them 
fletcher said therese terry 43 has been missing since january 
colin english was arrested in june and charged with fraud in 
relation to funds taken from mrs terrys bank account 
while in custody he drew a map which he says gives the answer 
to where she is buried fletcher said he claims she died at 
her own hand 
keene who was given the puzzle friday said he was unable to 
pin down the burial site but it is my firm belief that the body 
is located some miles northwest of limerick 
keene wrote in todays times that the diagram was a crude mirror 
image of southern ireland rotated 90 degrees to put east at the 
bottom and that roman numerals stood for various places in england 
and ireland 
he believes the black king is the suspect the black queen is 
the victim the black pawn is the suspects brother and the white 
pawns are the police a scarcely veiled insult to the suspects 
assessment of the competence of the police force 
keene wrote that the moves appear to show events between jan 
18 when mrs terry left lancashire for london and jan 23 when 
english returned from ireland 
keene said that while trying to solve the puzzle he recalled a 
sherlock holmes story called the dancing men in which sir 
arthur conan doyles fictional detective breaks a code that used 
figures of dancing stick men 
he also was inspired by lewis carrolls story in which alice 
enters a world of reflections peopled mainly by chess pieces

members of a political party 
considered close to tamil tiger rebels today resigned from 
parliament to protest what they called atrocities by the military 
in its war against the guerrillas 
the government declared a curfew in the northern district of 
kilinochchi and began search operations for rebels involved in a 
fierce gun battle with troops sunday at least nine soldiers and 18 
rebels were killed in the battle military officials said 
the deaths were among 122 reported sunday 
at least 76 rebels were killed in what the officials described 
as mopping up operations in the east eight soldiers and three 
civilians died in other fighting in the north they said 
the bodies of eight moslems believed killed by the rebels were 
found in the east they said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the deaths raise to at least 2856 the number of combatants 
killed since fighting resumed june 11 between the rebels and 
security forces many civilians also have died 
all 11 members of the eelavur democratic front resigned from 
parliament today we do not want to be dormant spectators who 
witness the tormentation of our people they said in a statement 
the front won 13 of the 225 seats in parliament in the 1989 
general elections two of its members resigned earlier this year 
for personal reasons 
last month the group called for a ceasefire between the tamil 
rebels and the government president ranasinghe premadasa rejected 
the offer asking the rebels to lay down their arms first 
it appears that the hope we had that the solution be made 
through political measures is not sensible the statement said 
the chance to find a solution to the problems of the 
tamilspeaking people is out of reach 
tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas population and say they 
are discriminated against by the majority sinhalese tamil rebels 
began fighting for an independent homeland in 1983 the tigers are 
the largest rebel group

the death penalty was outlawed after their execution 
nistor and the rest of the tribunal were replaced and the trial

to the official transcript from the meeting published in bucharest 
dailies the defendants agreed with the decision 
the latest official figures show that at least 1038 people were

the government is considering issuing up 
to 100000 gas masks in southern poland to protect people from air 
pollution an official said today 
a proposal is being drafted to distribute them in heavily 
industrialized katowice province said col czeslaw bujala of the 
provincial civil defense office 
air and water pollution has reached desperate levels across 
poland because of outdated factories a heavy dependence on coal 
and decades of neglect of the environment 
the problem is particularly severe for the 4 million residents 
of katowice in the silesia region katowice accounts for 20 
percent of polands industrial output and 30 percent of its air 
pollution the province makes up 2 percent of the national 
territory but has a population density five times the national 
average a 1988 report said it is home to a quarter of polands 900 
worstpolluting plants 
elevated infant mortality rates substantially increased cases 
of tuberculosis cancers and other diseases as well as shortened 
life expectancy are documented in the region 
the province has 1053 factories making hazardous materials or 
using them for production the zycie warszawy newspaper reported 
it said initial plans call for distributing gas masks to up to 
100000 people particularly those living near seven plants 
considered the most dangerous in case of accidental emissions the 
newspaper said 
bujala confirmed the report and said by telephone we have the 
gas masks and we are considering giving them to people mainly to 
those who live near factories producing toxic elements 
the plan still must be approved by civil defense headquarters 
he said 
the new solidarityled government has vowed to address the 
pollution problem but is hampered by lack of funds 
environmental minister bronislaw kaminski recently published a 
list of the 80 worst polluting factories and ordered them to meet 
emissions standards or face possible closure

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee announced today he will oppose future production of the 
b2 bomber a major boost to house efforts to kill the aircraft 
president bush has sought 
production of the b2 should be stopped and the production 
facility should be mothballed research and development should be 
continued and completed rep les aspin dwis said in a speech 
to be delivered on the house floor 
aspin cited the increasing fiscal constraints on the defense 
budget as the basis for his decision the chairman noted that five 
strategic programs the b2 bomber the c17 transport plane the 
advanced tactical fighter the a12 attack plane and the light 
helicopter will cost more than 300 billion 
specifically the cost of a single b2 bomber is estimated at 
nearly 860 million a price tag that has caused sticker shock 
among members of congress 
the answer to the question of whether the b2 will be as 
stealthy and otherwise work as advertised is the early results are 
good but we just dont know yet aspin said 
in the final analysis the armed services chairman said the 
program turned up no unique and compelling mission for the b2 
in proposing a 307 billion defense budget for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 bush called for 55 billion for five of the 
radarevading aircraft and related items 
faced with a diminishing soviet threat and a burgeoning federal 
deficit defense secretary dick cheney in april revised the 
administrations request to two planes in fiscal 1991 
cheney also cut the total number of planes to built from 132 to 
75 at a total cost of 63 billion 
aspins announcement is certain to help legislation sponsored by 
reps ron dellums dcalif john rowland rconn and john 
kasich rohio to stop production of the planes at the 15 
currently in development 
in his speech aspin said he would incorporate the 
dellumskasichrowland amendment in his proposal to the committee 
last year the legislation failed in the house by a vote of 
279144 largely because aspin opposed the bill and joined forces 
with rep mike synar dokla on a compromise bill that scaled 
back the program 
the aspinsynar amendment was approved 257160 
although proponents of the house measure are optimistic they can 
kill the program support for the batwinged aircraft in the senate 
remains strong 
the senate armed services committee in approving a 289 billion 
defense bill earlier this month approved the administrations 
request for two planes in fiscal 1991 and the panels chairman 
sen sam nunn dga remains a strong supporter of the aircraft 
aspins decision comes as his panel is scheduled to begin 
crafting their version of the defense bill for fiscal 1991 the 
committee will draw up a budget to a total of 283 billion 24 
billion less than bush proposed

the african national congress 
today acknowledged that anc guerrillas have been infiltrating south 
africa and many have been arrested but it denied reports of a 
revolution plot 
south africas communist party also denied the allegations 
which said communist party members within the anc were planning an 
insurrection without the approval of the african national congress 
also today police reported 21 people killed sunday night and 
today following battles in two johannesburgarea townships between 
anc supporters and members of the zulubased inkatha party 
the communist party said in a statement that the government 
allegations reported in newspapers sunday were a redscare 
tactic designed to coincide with a communist rally planned this 
weekend in the black township of soweto 
an anc leader walter sisulu also denied the newspaper reports 
which quoted government sources as saying a secret unit of anc 
guerrillas directed by the communist party planned an armed 
insurrection because they oppose the ancs policy of negotiating 
with the government 
the reports said the anc military wings command did not know of 
the plot 
sisulu said it was impossible for the communist party to have a 
different agenda from the anc because the two organizations share 
many leaders 
he was quoted in the daily mail newspaper as saying the anc 
believed as many as 150 of its members had been arrested in recent 
weeks 
he said he assumed the guerrillas had been engaged in the 
normal activities of the organization and noted the ancs armed 
struggle had not been suspended 
the citizen a progovernment newspaper with strong ties to the 
security police said today that president fw de klerk planned to 
make an announcement about a national insurrection plot this 
week 
the disclosures are expected to be so serious that they will 
shake the world and could have a profound effect on internal 
policies the citizen said 
the presidents office denied de klerk intended to make such a 
statement 
the state security council met today to discuss the insurrection 
allegations according to newspaper reports 
the anc executive committee also met today in preparation for 
its next round of talks with the government on aug 6 to discuss a 
ceasefire and other issues 
the government wants the anc to formally end its ineffective 
29yearold armed struggle and has asked nelson mandela and other 
anc leaders to stop war talk but the anc has said it will not 
suspend the military wings activities until the government has 
made irreversible changes to end apartheid and share power 
sisulu said he expected detentions of anc members to continue as 
long as the organization had not arranged a ceasefire with the 
government but one thing we are not going to do is to stop the 
process of negotiations 
a man claiming to be a sublieutenant in the ancs military wing 
reportedly entered the us consulate in durban seeking asylum 
an anc official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
dhekumusa jabulani ximbe 38 had been in hiding since police 
raided his home a week ago and confiscated a cache of hand grenades 
and limpet mines 
the official said the raid was part of the nationwide police 
sweep on anc militants and communist party members who recently 
returned from exile or infiltrated secretly 
police reported 21 people were found dead after running battles 
in the townships of sebokeng and evaton after inkatha held a rally 
at a stadium 
police said they fired tear gas and tried to separate the 
factions and that one policeman was killed by a thrown spear

salman rushdie has joined his moslem critics in 
opposing a ban on a pakistani film that depicts him as a murderer 
and a moslem leader said today that his group will demand the ban 
be lifted 
the british board of film classification has refused to permit 
distribution of international guerrillas which depicts 
rushdie author of the satanic verses as the agent of an 
international conspiracy 
the boards chairman james ferman said today that it had to 
ban the film on legal advice that the movie appeared to violate the 
law of criminal libel 
it was the most difficult decision that the board has ever 
taken ferman said monday 
those of us who believe in freedom of expression believed 
very strongly there was an argument for not increasing the 
grievance of the moslem community and taking the film with a pinch 
of salt 
sher azam president of the council of mosques in bradford 
said the ban clearly shows there is discrimination double 
standards and hypocrisy in high places against moslems 
now they have made this decision surely we will be doing 
something about writing to them and saying that the public at large 
should have an opportunity to see this film azam said 
rushdie was born into a moslem family in india and now is a 
british subject he has been in hiding under guard since february 
1989 when the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran said the 
satanic verses blasphemed islam and that rushdie deserved to die 
the 3hour film portrays rushdie as the agent of a conspiracy 
against islam and depicts him killing and torturing moslems until 
he himself is killed by a bolt of lightning 
rushdie believes the film should not be censored one of his 
supporters said 
he feels it should not be decided in advance what the public 
should or should not see without there being proof that it would 
cause public disorder said frances dsouza chairwoman of the 
rushdie defense committee 
the reaction of the moslem community is in itself 
understandable they feel they have been blasphemed by the book and 
feel there are two different standards being applied ms dsouza 
said sunday 
mohammed fayyaz of london who owns the worldwide distribution 
rights to the film said he would try to persuade the film board to 
overturn the ban then go through the appeals procedure 
if still they refuse us then we will go to court he said 
the film board issued a statement saying we are informed that 
this video presents a prima facie case of criminal libel on a 
british citizen salman rushdie and that the libel is a serious 
one 
the board said the distributor of the film had been told that it 
could be resubmitted if the rushdie character had a new name and 
if calls for rushdies death were excised 
an editorial in the times of london noted that rushdies own 
defense of his book is that it is fiction 
the distributors will argue in turn that a film which shows 
mr rushdie slitting the throats of good muslims or more horrid 
torture still forcing them to listen to tapes of the satanic 
verses should also be construed as fiction the times said 
it added that in any case a ban will mean that millions not a 
few thousands will want to see what is now a notorious film 
censorship always backfires 
rushdies publisher announced earlier this month that two new 
books by him would soon be brought out they will be his first 
since the satanic verses brought the death threats from 
khomeini 
the death threats have hampered restoration of diplomatic ties 
between tehran and london which were effectively severed in june 
1987 after a series of expulsions of diplomats

president bushs opposition to abortion 
remains unchanged but there will be no litmus test on specific 
issues in his search for a supreme court nominee bushs 
spokesman said today 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that bush 
would meet with key advisers each day through the week as he 
ponders a successor to retired supreme court justice william j 
brennan 
he wants the best candidate the most qualified candidate a 
person of experience and temperament and wants to pursue that 
search for a person with the least constraints possible 
fitzwater said 
asked whether bush would insist on knowing the abortion views of 
his court nominee fitzwater said we cant define what the 
specific philosophy would be of the candidate 
you can expect that he would look for someone who favors a 
faithful interpretation of the constitution as opposed to seeing 
the court as a legislative tool but there will be no litmus test 
on specific issues fitzwater said 
the president views on the issue have not changed but there 
will be no litmus test fitzwater said bush opposes abortion 
except to protect the life of the mother or in cases of rape and 
incest 
fitzwater said that bush still intends to name his choice as 
quickly as possible and already had a fairly well defined list of 
people who are qualified from which to work 
bush met with attorney general dick thornburgh today and other 
top advisers after holding similar meetings over the weekend 
fitzwater said that the president planned to meet frequently with 
thornburgh chief of staff john sununu and white house counsel 
boyden gray as he narrows his list 
in addition the president called four congressional leaders 
over the weekend to get their views on a nominee fitzwater said 
they were senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan house speaker thomas foley 
dwash and house minority leader robert michel rill 
i think its fair to say that most of the candidates we are 
looking at have judicial experience and already have undergone 
review by the american bar association fitzwater said 
meanwhile key senators say president bush should shun 
ideologues and look for solid judicial experience in his choice 
but even so congressional leaders are suggesting that abortion is 
likely to be a focal point in senate debate no matter who the 
president selects 
if the president sends up somebody committed to overturning 
roe vs wade there will be a battle sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio said today if the nominee is not committed to an 
antiabortion position he added i think such a person will be 
confirmed if he has a decent balanced background 
sen orrin hatch rutah appearing with metzenbaum on nbcs 
today show said no one issue should be a determinant on a 
persons future on the supreme court and predicted the judiciary 
committee on which he and metzenbaum both sit would not ask 
direct questions on a nominees position on abortion 
dole said abortion shouldnt be the single litmus test in 
picking a supreme court justice 
the gop leader acknowledged however that he has warned bush 
that i assume the big a word would be the tough hurdle to 
climb 
if you have to have someone who wants to overturn roe vs 
wade its going to be a bloodbath getting the nomination 
confirmed and the same is true on the other side he said 
bush has said he hopes to have a new justice seated by october 
brennan who was a leading voice of liberalism on the supreme 
court resigned friday 
conservatives have held a slim 54 majority on the court and 
liberals fear brennans successor could push the court further to 
the right 
possible candidates who have been mentioned include solicitor 
general kenneth w starr federal appellate judges edith h jones 
and patrick e higginbotham of the 5th circuit william w wilkins 
jr of the 4th circuit and david souter of the 1st circuit 
other federal appellate judges mentioned are roger j miner and 
ralph k winter jr both of the 2nd circuit j harvie wilkinson 
iii of the 4th circuit and pamela a rymer a former federal 
district judge whom bush recently put on the 9th circuit 
there also has been speculation bush might want to appoint the 
courts first hispanic justice possible candidates would be 
ferdinand fernandez a federal judge from california and ricardo 
hinojosa a federal judge from texas

continued warm dry weather and dense 
smoke today hampered crews battling some of the 121 fires reported 
across central alaska 
ninety fire crews or more than 2600 people were fighting the 
fires which had charred more than 1 million acres of timber and 
tundra by today officials said 
crews were focusing on just a few of the fires said trish 
hogervorstrukke a spokeswoman with the alaska fire information 
center in fairbanks theyre concentrating on the fires 
threatening structures she said today 
many firefighting crews had been released recently as scattered 
showers and cooler temperatures dampened many of the states fires 
but they are returning because of the dry weather and highs in the 
80s said john quinley a national park service spokesman 
no one has been injured and few dwellings have been lost 
officials said most of the fires have been caused by lightning 
the 54000acre tok river fire started by lightning three weeks 
ago remains the states most laborintensive fire occupying 
nearly 800 firefighters more crews are being assigned there than 
at other fires because the fire is relatively close to two towns 
tok and tetlin junction 
the beaver fire north of the yukon river was alaskas largest 
the fire on sunday had burned a section of spruce forest 10 miles 
wide by 48 miles long hogervorstrukke said 
the fire had burned to within four miles of the chandalar river 
and authorities expect it to diminish once it hits the river she 
said 
the kanuti flats fire about 140 miles north of fairbanks was 
burning 100000 acres on sunday and was within two miles of the 
transalaska oil pipeline 
authorities were monitoring the fire but it was not being 
fought the pipeline is buried beneath the tundra near where the 
fire is burning officials said 
smoke was a widespread problem 
fires along the alaska highway had reduced visibility to less 
than 2 miles in a wide region from tok to fairbanks 
the smoke is so dense that its reducing temperatures and 
raising the relative humidity in some areas hogervorstrukke 
said the sun simply cant penetrate it 
the flip side is that we cant see the fires were using a 
speciallymodified plane with an infrared camera to look through 
the smoke and locate the hotspots

the education department said today it is 
holding daily meetings in an effort to resolve a financial crisis 
at one of the nations largest guarantors of student loans 
its a matter of urgency department spokeswoman etta fielek 
said today after a morning session on problems at the higher 
education assistance foundation 
the nonprofit corporation based in overland park kan 
guarantees nearly 10 billion in student loans 
the foundation has notified the department that it is facing 
serious financial problems education secretary lauro cavazos 
said in a statement late last week he said the department was 
considering various options that would ensure the availability of 
new loans and the continuation of guarantees and claim payments on 
outstanding loans 
fielek said heaf has asked congress and the department to 
approve a federally assisted takeover by another guarantor the 
nebraska student loan program inc 
but she said the department was apprehensive about that proposal 
theres a problem of scale fielek said theres concern 
on the part of the department that nebraska would be too small an 
operation to consume something the magnitude of heaf 
there are 55 guarantors responsible for repaying banks in the 
event of defaults on student loans heaf is a national guarantor 
operating in many states while nebraska operates in only one state 
the student loan program will make a projected 13 billion in 
loans this year and has 51 billion in loans outstanding 
according to a report today in the wall street journal heaf 
expects a cash shortfall of 50 million to 100 million in the next 
12 months 
part of heafs problem is that it has guaranteed billions in 
highrisk trade school loans with high default rates scott hoober 
a spokesman for the corporation said such loans accounted for 59 
percent of heafs portfolio in 1988 but only 35 percent in 1989 
after heaf had begun to restructure its portfolio

a government satellite due for a 
ride into space on an unmanned atlas rocket is to spray the cosmos 
with chemicals for a look at the earths usually invisible magnetic 
and electric fields 
a third attempt at launch was scheduled for 326 pm today 
despite predictions for bad weather at midday officials said the 
chances that conditions would be good enough to launch were still 
less than 5050 
launch sunday was called off less than two hours before liftoff 
because of the threat of severe thunderstorms the first attempt 
on friday was postponed because of a helium leak 
a liquid helium vent duct used for engine cooling apparently 
slipped off an engine outlet in the rockets upperstage thrust 
section as a precaution all four vent ducts were replaced with a 
new set saturday said jack isabel spokesman for rocket builder 
general dynamics 
any time you dont launch you are disappointed isabel said 
sunday but when the weather is in sync and were in sync im 
sure well get off and be successful 
the atlas 1 rocket making its commercial debut was to boost 
the combined release and radiation effects satellite or crres 
into an elliptical orbit 217 miles by 22236 miles high the 189 
million satellite is a joint program of nasa and the defense 
department 
twentyfour canisters filled with barium lithium and other 
chemicals will be ejected from the satellite over the next year 
the released chemicals will be ionized by the suns ultraviolet 
rays creating glowing clouds about 60 miles in diameter 
the clouds will spread along earths magnetic field lines 
allowing scientists to see the normally invisible charged particles 
of the ionosphere and magnetosphere 
the 2ton satellite was to have been deployed in 1987 from space 
shuttle challenger but the mission and all others were put on hold 
after the challenger disaster in 1986 
the national aeronautics and space administration and the air 
force opted for a quicker launch aboard general dynamics 
commercial atlas the satellite was redesigned to fit into the 
rockets payload fairing 
the launch will be the first of a commercial version of the 
atlas and the eighth commercial rocket launch by an american 
company general dynamics provided the 65 million rocket and 
launch services under a barter agreement with nasa in return nasa 
gets the satellite launched 
earlier versions of the atlas were used by nasa to boost 
planetary probes and other midsized payloads 
it hasnt been a good year for nasa 
leaks have grounded the shuttles and john logsdon director of 
the space policy institute at george washington university said it 
will take more than a successful shuttle launch to get nasa back on 
track 
the agency is supposed to be doing more than just getting 
shuttles launched he said thats important but in a sense 
its the minimum requirement 
logsdon expects it will take years for nasa to clear its name 
over the debacle created by the hubble space telescope a 15 
billion project unable to fulfill its potential because of a flawed 
mirror that cannot be repaired until 1993 at the earliest 
nasas proposed space station freedom has come under attack by 
congress too a study released friday shows up to 10 spacewalks a 
week will be needed to maintain outside components of the station 
unless major design changes are made 
the bush administration last week ordered an outside panel of 
experts to consider the longterm direction of americas space 
program

argentine novelist manuel puig who 
abandoned filmmaking for a literature with cinematic style and 
gained fame for kiss of the spider woman has died of a heart 
attack at age 57 
puig suffering complications from gall bladder surgery died 
sunday at a hospital 
he had earned a reputation as a leading member of the younger 
generation of latin american writers puigs works often explored 
the relationships between his characters impoverished lives and 
their rich if unfulfilled fantasies 
he turned away from a potential career as a filmmaker to devote 
himself to literature but his style reflected the influence of 
screenplays with little descriptive prose 
i mostly hear the action puig said in a 1985 new york times 
interview when i started writing i found i trusted more the 
language of the characters than the first person 
puig wrote several novels and some were later made into movies 
including kiss of the spider woman betrayed by rita 
hayworth eternal curse on the reader of these pages and 
heartbreak tango 
brazilian filmmaker hector babencos 1985 film version of kiss 
of the spider woman starring william hurt and raul julia 
brought the novelist a larger international audience hurt won an 
academy award for that performance 
the novel kiss of the spider woman was set in a bleak south 
american prison cell shared by a marxist guerrilla and a 
homosexual their dialogue is interspersed with the homosexual 
molinas recounting of plots of romantic movies 
puig was born on december 28 1932 in the small town of general 
villegas on the arid pampas of argentina as a youth he spent 
much of his free time in the local movie theater watching popular 
american and argentine films 
he studied philosophy at the university of buenos aires during 
the early 1950s and won a scholarship to study film in italy in 
1956 he went on to work on several films but his futile attempts 
at writing screenplays led him into literature 
one failed attempt at a screenplay in 1961 developed into the 
autobiographical novel betrayed by rita hayworth about the 
influence american movies have on the people of a small argentine 
town it was completed in 1965 but published three years later 
partly because of problems with censorship 
panned by argentine critics the book received more favorable 
reviews in france and the united states and puig began writing 
more novels 
with the return of juan peron to power in argentina in 1973 
puig felt increasingly alienated from his country he went into 
selfimposed exile eventually settling in mexico he moved to new 
york city in 1976 partly because of a heart condition then 
settled later in rio de janiero brazil 
he is survived by his mother maria elena de puig a brother 
carlos puig and sons javier labrada and agustin garcia gil all of 
whom live in cuernavaca 
puig had lived in cuernavaca 50 miles south of mexico city 
since october 
his funeral was held there sunday night he will be buried in a 
family plot in la plata argentina labrada said

president francesco cossiga wants an investigation 
into a report on government television that the cia supported 
terrorism activity in italy and played a part in the slaying of 
swedish prime minister olaf palme 
the cia today denied the report and called it nonsense 
the allegations were made during a series of television 
interviews with two men who claimed to have worked for the cia one 
was identified as dick brenneke the other wore a hood during the 
interviews on staterun rai television saying he wanted to protect 
his identity 
the television report alleged the cia paid licio gelli 
grandmaster of the secret propaganda due p2 masonic lodge to 
foment terrorist activities in italy 
the p2 has been accused of seeking to install a rightwing 
dictatorship in italy during the 1970s with the help of secret 
service officials at that time rightwing and leftwing terrorist 
groups were active in italy 
gelli denied the tv report and said he would sue rai for libel 
charges were also made in the rai report that the cia and p2 
were involved in the palme murder in 1986 the killing remains 
unsolved 
in a statement issued today in washington the cia said the 
agency flatly denies that mr brenneke was ever an agent of the cia 
or associated in any way with the cia we repeat this public denial 
because of the outrageous nature of his claims allegations 
attributed to him regarding agency involvement in terrorist 
activities in italy or the palme assassination are absolute 
nonsense 
in a letter to prime minister giulio andreotti cossiga said 
the information broadcast in these transmissions requires in my 
opinion a serious evaluation on the part of the italian 
government 
cossigas letter was dated july 3 shortly after the interviews 
were broadcast the presidents office released the letter sunday 
after the newsweekly panorama reported its existence 
cossiga said if the government felt the charges were 
wellfounded the case should be turned over to the courts and a 
parliamentary commission on terrorism if the information was false 
or reckless he said rai should be taken to court

aboard but no one was injured railway officials said monday 
the bulletnosed tgv train a grand vitesse or highspeed 
train was traveling at a relatively slow 78 mph when it struck

pulling remained on the rails 
officials from the national railway societe national des 
chemins de fer said the rail used to block the track came from a 
nearby repair site

by regional residents opposed to a plans to expand the highspeed 
rail network into the provence wine country 
this was the work of idle juveniles not train sabotage a 
railway spokesman said

toulonnice line from sunday evening until dawn monday a crane 
lifted the locomotive onto the track and another engine towed it to 
a rail yard for inspection

marilyn quayle underwent surgery over the 
weekend for cervical cancer detected in a pap smear according to 
sources close to the family the vice presidents office said today 
she is doing well 
the operation was performed at bethesda naval hospital vice 
president dan quayles office revealed today quayle has visited 
his wife there every day since the operation on saturday said 
spokesman david beckwith 
shes doing well we expect her home sometime this week 
said beckwith 
mrs quayle 40 has been active in a breast cancer awareness 
campaign she testified before a congressional health subcommittee 
in may and both she and the vice president ran in a celebrity 
5kilometer race for the cure to encourage women to undergo 
early screening and mammograms 
despite her highprofile involvement in that campaign the 
quayles appeared reluctant to disclose full details of her 
condition the announcement did not reveal what the actual 
diagnosis was or where the operation took place 
beckwith said today he had no further word on the disease or 
the operation 
but the sources said sunday the operation was for cervical 
cancer that had been detected earlier this year it was not an 
emergency procedure according to the sources who spoke only on 
condition they not be named 
president bush called mrs quayle over the weekend to wish her 
a speedy recovery spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the original announcement said mrs quayle who turns 41 on 
sunday was recovering well from the operation and will 
resume her full schedule in four to six weeks full and total 
recovery is expected 
the quayles also urged all women to have yearly pap tests 
a pap test can help detect two dozen or more medical problems 
but its primary purpose is to uncover malignancies in the 
reproductive tract said dr allan b weingold chairman of 
obstetrics and gynecology at the george washington university 
medical center weingold is not involved in treating mrs quayle 
other doctors speculated that she had undergone a simple 
hysterectomy or removal of the uterus given the white house 
announcement on the length of her convalescence and the expectation 
of full and total recovery 
the pap test is named for dr george papanicolau who introduced 
the procedure nearly half a century ago it is credited with 
reducing deaths from cervical and uterine cancer in the united 
states by 70 percent 
mrs quayle a lawyer and mother of three became active in 
breast cancer education last year her mother mary tucker an 
indiana pediatrician died of breast cancer in 1975 at age 56 
mrs quayle has said her mother might have been spared had the 
disease been detected earlier

treaty negotiations between the soviet unions 
baltic republics could provide them with the basis for an economic 
or political association outside the soviet government the prime 
minister of latvia said monday 
ivars godmanis said however that latvia one of the baltic 
states considering independence from moscow should have separate 
relationships with russia the ukraine and the other 15 soviet 
republics before such a union is formed 
we have concluded that direct bilateral treaties and decisions 
between different states i have said states independent states 
will be the fundament godmanis said in a speech at the national 
press club 
he called his goal finlandization which he defined as good 
neighborly relations with the soviets such as nearby finland has 
had in the united states finlandization has been used to mean 
subordination to the soviet union 
godmanis noted that the baltic states in which multiparty 
systems already exist did not joined in the formation of the 
soviet union in a 1922 treaty but were occupied by the soviets in 
1940 at the start of world war ii 
latvian foreign minister janis jurkans who is traveling with 
godmanis said that although the united states has continued to 
recognize baltic diplomatic representation in washington since the 
1940 occupation the us does not recognize his government its 
recognition by the soviet union must come first he said in an 
interview 
godmanis said his government expects to become a member of the 
united nations as it was a member of the league of nations before 
1940 and to have its own diplomats

more than a century after he fell in 
battle and nearly 20 years after his bones were unearthed by a 
south carolina road crew an anonymous civil war soldier is headed 
for a heros burial in massachusetts 
were going to feel very good when we finally put him to rest 
in his native soil hes had a strange journey said robert 
berkeley a member of the volunteer 12th massachusetts regiment and 
the 2nd rhode island infantry which reenact civil war battles 
burial is scheduled for aug 4 at the massachusetts national 
cemetery at bourne 
the soldiers origins havent become clear since his remains 
were found in the early 1970s 
id love to know more details but im afraid theyve been 
lost in time said larry fudger administrative director of 
family court in sumter county sc and a civil war buff 
were just at a point now where this individual whoever he 
is whatever he died of is a federal soldier that fought for his 
country and he needs a decent burial said fudger who takes part 
in reenactments of civil war battles in his spare time 
the idea of bringing the body back to massachusetts started in 
spring 1989 when berkeley and fudger met at a battle reenactment 
the modern history of the unknown soldier goes back about 20 
years when the remains were unearthed by a road crew working in 
clarendon county sc fudger said 
the county sheriff sent the remains to a laboratory and reports 
indicated the bones were those of a man between ages 19 and 21 who 
had died many years before fudger said 
fragments of cloth and buttons indicated the man was probably a 
union soldier fudger said it was theorized that he died during an 
assault on a confederate supply troop in the area at the close of 
the war in 1865 
the road they found him on is the road the union soldiers came 
down fudger said 
once it was determined that the sheriff did not have a murder 
investigation on his hands the remains just got lost in the 
shuffle and have been stored at a south carolina funeral parlor 
fudger said 
because many of the soldiers in the area were from 
massachusetts local historians think the soldier most likely came 
from that state fudger said further speculation is that he may 
have been black because the 54th massachusetts the regiment 
commemorated in the movie glory was in the area along with 
other black regiments 
the old forensic tests didnt determine whether the victim was 
black or white and no tests have been conducted since on the 
remains fudger said 
fudger said he and his fellow volunteers are glad to see the 
episode draw to a close 
were just trying to do the right thing by him he said

misdemeanor cocaine possession charges barry faces by arguing that 
a videotape proved barry arrived for the meeting just moments after 
10 am that day 
a government witness lydia reid pearson has testified that she 
gave crack cocaine and a city job application to the mayor 
shortly after 10 am that day 
but assistant us attorney judith retchin has argued that the 
mayors tardiness allowed him to pick up the drugs from pearson at 
the time pearson said she delivered them to him 
the two defense witnesses former top city official joseph 
yeldell and district of columbia fire chief ray alfred agreed with 
retchins suggestion that the meeting began sometime after 1030 
am 
i know we did have a slight delay before the meeting 
yeldell said 
the prosecutor said the videotape made of the gathering confirms 
that it began late 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug 
use 
pearsons testimony is the most specific with regard to date 
and time of any of the possession charges lodged against the mayor 
retchin argued last week that barrys car telephone records 
indicate that the mayor did not arrive for the meeting until 
approximately 1045 am or minutes after the last call was 
logged his late arrival would have given pearson time to slip him 
the drugs as he came to the meeting retchin said 
all that proves perhaps is that someone else was using the 
car phone mundy shot back 
mundy who expects to complete his case this week says he may 
call key prosecution witness charles lewis to ask him about his 
ties to the family of a notorious district of columbia drug dealer 
lewis a twiceconvicted cocaine dealer has portrayed himself 
as a smalltime drug peddler whose distribution network was 
designed primarily to keep himself and his friends supplied with 
narcotics 
but mundy relying on notes from a police interrogation of 
lewis said friday that lewis once introduced a drug cohort to a 
man identified as rayful edmond 
the notes do not make clear whether lewis met with rayful edmond 
jr or rayful edmond iii but the distinction is important 
rayful edmond iii is serving two consecutive life terms in 
prison after being convicted last december of running an elaborate 
washington cocaine supply network prosecutors estimated that the 
younger edmonds drug ring was responsible for up to 30 percent of 
the cocaine supply in the nations capital 
witnesses in that trial said the elder edmond also was involved 
with drugs but he has never been charged with a crime 
mundy said lewis ties to edmond show that lewis was untruthful 
about his own drug activity and can be used to cast doubt on other 
aspects of his testimony particularly his assertions that he 
provided barry with cocaine on numerous occasions 
retchin insisted in court friday that lewis did not know rayful 
edmond iii likewise rayful edmond iiis attorney said his client 
does not know lewis

president bush and the leaders of congress 
will meet daily this week for hard bargaining to produce an 
agreement to cut the federal deficit the white house said today 
bush will confer with the house and senate leaders on tesday 
before departing for political speeches in philadelphia and new 
york spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the tentative plan is for them to meet each day this week 
early in the morning he said 
this is a period of very intense negotiations the president 
wants to give it a major push he said so they felt the 
leadership should get together and do some hard bargaining to see 
if we cant get it resolved 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters we are 
going to get reports back and forth exchange ideas and approaches 
we do not intend to make agreements outside the summit group 
foley said the meetings would be continuous but not 
necessarily daily 
bush and the leaders last met on wednesday before the president 
embarked on a threeday western trip during which he blamed the 
democrats for government by gridlock in washington 
fitzwater said bush is aiming for a budget agreement before 
congress takes its summer break 
we would hope to have an agreement between the president and 
the legislative branch by the time of the august recess 
fitzwater said

hopes for an accord by aug 3 or aug 10 
we would share his view of the timetable said fitzwater 
the office of management and budget in its midsession budget 
review last monday estimated that the fiscal 1991 deficit has 
ballooned to 169 billion not counting 62 billion in costs of the 
savings and loan cleanup 
theres still a great deal to be done on all the issues 
fitzwater said they have reached the point where theyre dealing 
with very specific options and they are trying to make judgments 
about them 
he gave no specifics 
bush said in boise idaho last thursday that ive done my 
part by agreeing to consider raising tax revenues and now its 
their turn meaning he wants the democratic leaders to put a 
package of spending cuts on the table

the navy began its needleinahaystack search 
of the ocean floor today for a cargo door that blew off a united 
airlines jumbo jet and caused nine people to be swept to their 
death over the pacific 17 months ago 
investigators hope the door will help them establish beyond 
doubt the cause of the accident 
during the weeklong search a deepsea probe equipped with sonar 
and a video camera will be dragged across a 24squaremile area 
about 100 miles southwest of honolulu 
if the door is spotted another device will be used at a later 
date to recover it 
after their ship arrived at the scene overnight workers this 
morning began setting up a transponder field an electronic grid 
used to mark locations during the sophisticated undersea probe 
said lt cmdr bob anderson a spokesman for the pacific fleet 
flight 811 was bound for new zealand on feb 24 1989 with 355 
people aboard when the door tore popped off at 22000 feet 
carrying away a section of fuselage and causing sudden 
decompression of the boeing 747 nine people were sucked out five 
others were seriously hurt the crew managed to return the jet to 
honolulu 
the national transportation safety board concluded that a 
deficiency in the design of the doors locking mechanism probably 
indicated to the pilot that the door was locked when it was not 
the agency blamed united the boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failure to correct problems with the door 
ntsb investigators said the door still could provide evidence 
for improving aircraft safety the agency asked the navy to find it 
the door is believed to be 15000 feet down 
its like a needle in a haystack but a big factor is what the 
bottom looks like said project manager bob whaley 
whaley said the ocean floor in the search area is generally 
flat which is good for searching 
the cost of the project will not be known until it is completed 
anderson said 
a search for the door was to have begun last october but was 
delayed by technical problems during testing of the orion deep 
submergence search system he said 
the 226foot navy ocean tug narragansett left pearl harbor on 
sunday and arrived on the scene about midnight the underwater 
portion of the search system known as a towfish is attached to 
the tug by a 35000foot triplearmored cable 
the towfish is operated from on board the vessel a computer 
enhances its sonar findings for later analysis anderson said 
the orion system has been used once before to retrieve an 
airplane that crashed off the east coast earlier this year 
anderson said 
the search will be carried out by the navys prime contractor 
for underwater search operations the naval sea systems command and 
steadfast search division of oceaneering international inc 
anderson said 
oceaneering international helped find wreckage from an airindia 
jumbo jet that was ripped apart by a bomb over the atlantic in 
1985 and parts of a south african jumbo jet that burst into flames 
and crashed off east africa in 1987 
it made an unsuccessful attempt to recover vital parts from the 
korean air lines 747 shot down by the soviet union in 1983 and 
helped in the search for the space shuttle challenger in 1986 
anderson said

researchers have started a yearlong 
study to find out why polio survivors with type a personalities may 
suffer more severe postpolio problems than lessstressed victims 
of the disease 
the study will try to determine if there is a physical reason 
why the highachieving harddriving type as become more disabled 
said richard bruno a psychophysiologist at the kessler institute 
for rehabilitation in east orange 
bruno theorizes that all polio victims suffered brain damage 
when the virus struck some 35 years ago that damage is now 
beginning to show up the condition is known as postpolio sequelae 
its like running electricity in the house with only one 
fuse said bruno chairman of the national postpolio task force 
it worked for awhile but they finally blew a fuse 
compounding the problem bruno said is that stress adds to the 
damage that has already been done 
in an earlier study by bruno and nancy frick of harvest center 
in hackensack 676 polio survivors scored 18 points higher than the 
norm for type a personality characteristics 
bruno wasnt surprised 
they have to achieve more just to be the same they have to be 
time conscious it takes them twice as long to get dressed he 
said 
the pressure to strive and excel started in rehabilitation 
therapy virtually as soon as they began to recover he said 
the earlier study also found that 88 to 91 percent of all polio 
survivors said they suffered some symptoms of extreme fatigue 
weakness and muscle pain all occurring decades after the original 
polio virus attack 
the survivors who scored highest on the type a test suffered the 
most severe symptoms bruno said 
these people are overwhelmed he said they cant focus 
they cant remember sleeping doesnt help 
bruno said the medical community should have known that many of 
the 16 million polio survivors would be struck by these symptoms 
later in life 
he cited the 1949 work of dr david bodian of johns hopkins 
university who showed that the virus killed brain cells in the 
cortex that controlled motor functions it wipes out nerves 
that go to blood vessels 
bruno wants to test his theory that nerve cells damaged by polio 
are further impaired when survivors under stress release a large 
amount of cortisol hormone which keeps nerve cells from using 
glucose he believes this increased damage causes the extreme 
fatigue and may account for some of the other symptoms 
dr anthony windebank neurologist at the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn said the cortisol hormone theory was certainly 
a reasonable hypothesis at the cellular level it makes sense 
however windebank questioned whether personality type had 
anything to do with the severity of the postpolio symptoms 
mayo researchers studied a random group of 50 from the 250 
people still alive who were stricken with polio between 1935 and 
1955 in olmsted county minn where the clinic is located about 
20 percent of the 50 had quite significant problems the muscle 
pain fatigue and increased weakness he said 
but there was no tiein to personality traits he said when 
we looked at the psychological factors there was no difference at 
all with people who were having problems and the people who

capitals center today and government troops fought back from atop 
high buildings rocket and heavy machine gun fire shook downtown

loyal to a splinter group headed by prince johnson reports from 
the main rebel group said charles taylors fighters remained 
blocked by government troops on the eastern outskirts of monrovia 
the sources said taylors forces remain blocked by government 
troops on the eastern outskirts of monrovia the rebels who have 
fought their way into the city are loyal to johnson the sources 
said today 
johnson split with taylor several weeks ago and the rebel leader 
accused him of murdering several soldiers of taylors national 
patriotic front 
the dissidents subsequently attacked taylors forces forcing 
them to regroup and delay their assault on the capital 
todays attack came from the northwest from bushrod island 
across two bridges and through a swamp the diplomats in contact 
with monrovia said the insurgents involved in the attack were 
johnsons fighters 
defending government troops fired rockets from high buildings at 
the rebels 
there was heavy machinegun fire and rifle fire aroiund the 
telecommunications headquarters in the heart of the liberian 
capitals business district 
president samuel doe has said he will remain in the capital 
until the civil war is decided and sources say even if he tried to 
go sooner loyal soldiers would not let him leave without 
guaranteeing their safety 
the 500member presidential guard made up of soldiers from 
does krahn tribe fears massacre at the hands of rebels who have 
fought their way to within a mile of does oceanfront mansion 
sources in liberia said some government soldiers were urging the 
president to flee to avoid a bloodbath and that there was bitter 
infighting in the executive mansion doe has been deserted by 
nearly all senior members of his government 
doe in a telex to the british broadcasting corp said sunday 
that he would remain until a clear victor emerges 
the presidential mansion was stockpiled with ammunition and 
explosives said a diplomatic source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the president remained convinced he is invincible the 
source said adding that he expected doe to fight to the finish 
the source said doe was relying increasingly on his belief that 
black magic will save him 
rebel troops have overrun all of the bushrod island district 
containing the citys port fuel and storage depots and repair 
shops 
does eightstory mansion was like a desolate military camp 
with soldiers roaming the otherwise empty hallways the president 
was closeted in his fifthfloor apartment away from outsiders 
sources inside the mansion said does krahn bodyguards had 
gathered saturday with the president and told him they would refuse 
to allow him to leave unless their collective safety was guaranteed 
there were also reports of deep divisions within the krahn 
tribe the sources said the krahns fear the rebels will kill them 
in revenge for the killings of many civilians who support the 
rebels 
some retribution killings already have been reported by 
journalists with the rebels 
in exchange for allowing doe to leave the krahn soldiers seek 
safe passage to their home territory in grand gedeh county grand 
gedeh is does last remaining stronghold apart from his few 
remaining square miles in downtown monrovia 
but the rebel national patriotic front would fiercely resist any 
effort by doe to evacuate his forces to his home region with the 
gio and mano tribes among the countrys largest on taylors 
side the civil war has turned into an outright tribal conflict 
the rebels began their offensive in december and effectively 
control twothirds of the country 
they have accused doe who took power in a 1980 coup of 
corruption mismanagement and human rights abuses taylor has 
promised to maintain close ties with the united states if he comes 
to power but he has ruled out immediate elections 
the african nation founded by freed american slaves 150 years 
ago has traditionally had close ties with washington 
the us embassy has been trying to persuade doe to flee the 
capital 
washington refused to send in a peacekeeping force and on 
saturday doe ordered the american military attache expelled 
accusing him of helping the rebels the united states denied the 
accusations

goodwill can go too far 
after learning that a soviet pilot had been at the controls of a 
us navy fa18 fighter plane during an impromptu test ride at a 
july 8 air show at kalamazoo mich the defense department sent 
word to all the services dont let it happen again

that no american pilots would fly soviet planes wray said no

signs of division in chinas secretive top 
leadership have beijing residents buzzing at a time when hot days 
and muggy nights usually breed apathy even among the capitals avid 
politicswatchers 
will li ruihuan the upandcoming propaganda czar from tianjin 
prevail with his recent appeals for a kinder gentler marxism 
has 83yearold president yang shangkuns hospitalization for 
appendictis thrown him out of the running as a successor to senior 
leader deng xiaoping 
what about the latest report attributed to a chinese mayoral 
delegation in the united states that ousted communist party 
general secretary zhao ziyang is about to make a comeback 
and why cant ideological hardliner he jingzhi win confirmation 
as culture minister nearly one year after he was made acting 
minister 
among the laobaixing the old hundred names chinas 
nickname for ordinary folk selfappointed experts admit their 
bafflement 
no one knows whats going on said a college student who 
passionately follows politics 
western diplomats also appeared baffled 
there are many reasons for floating a rumor said one 
before launching into a halfhour analysis that ended with a shrug 
but all agree the summer political scene has suddenly become 
much more interesting than the long winter of monolithic hardline 
editorializing that followed the crushing of last years 
prodemocracy protests 
the shift is not immediately obvious portly often avuncular 
jiang zemin who replaced zhao as party chief frequently appears 
on national television leading soldiers and workers in singing the 
revolutionary classic unity is strength 
the official media are filled with production reports and 
commentaries on strengthening marxist education opposing bourgeois 
ideas and building party discipline 
most ordinary people hold closely to this line in public at 
least a chinese journalist who has had to write articles 
supporting the line even though he backed the democracy movement 
said bitterly it is like being raped 
it was the governments agreement in june to let dissident fang 
lizhi go to england after a year of hiding in the us embassy 
that crystallized the sense of a softening in the leaderships hard 
front 
youll be busy in the coming weeks because there will be a 
lot happening advised a middleaged intellectual with ties to 
the reformist camp 
western analysts linked fangs departure to pragmatic chinese 
needs such as retaining mostfavored nation trade status with the 
united states but the intellectual said a few months ago they 
wouldnt have done it it does show new flexibility 
the continued release of protesters jailed since last year added 
to the optimism a total of 881 have been freed and sources have 
said another group will be released soon 
shanghai mayor zhu rongji said in hong kong recently that fewer 
than 10 participants in last years democracy movement remain in 
jail without charges in his city he said he expects they will be 
released soon authorities say 355 people are still in jail 
undergoing investigation in beijing there are no nationwide 
figures 
authorities also have announced recently they will go ahead with 
plans stalled immediately after the hardline crackdown for 
developing a national securities market and transferring housing to 
private ownership 
great public interest has centered on a series of speeches by li 
ruihuan the former mayor of the east coast city of tianjin who 
joined the partys top leadership body the sixmember politburo 
standing committee after the ouster of zhao 
the 54yearold li a former carpenter who speaks in a 
distinctive somewhat shrill voice was put in charge of 
supervising the media and cultural circles 
he has used the role to make provocative comments on the nature 
of socialist society 
making human relations tense is not the original intention of 
marxism the semiofficial hong kong china news service quoted li 
as saying in june we should in various kinds of work enable 
people to have ease of mind and to be harmonious with each other 
the speech was widely commented on including in a workers 
daily article that denounced erroneous leftist emphasis on 
class struggle the notion of a continuing struggle within chinese 
society between the proletariat and remnants of the bourgeois class 
was revived after the crushing of the democracy movement last year 
a stir also was caused by reports from washington in late july 
that indicated zhao would be rehabilitated the official xinhua 
news agency denied the reports but only after a flustered foreign 
ministry spokesman said he couldnt confirm or deny it 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said it 
was unclear whether the source of the reports was reliable and 
that misinformation about zhaos status could have been floated by 
both his supporters and his opponents 
his enemies might want to remind people of all the reasons 
they dont want him to return to power before it happens the 
diplomat said

christian brando told a police officer i 
didnt mean to shoot him shortly after the killing of his half 
sisters boyfriend the officer testified today 
marlon brando sat in the front row of the jammed courtroom at 
the preliminary hearing for his 32yearold son the actor 
occasionally took notes as officials told under oath what happened 
the night 26yearold dag drollet was found slain at the brando 
mansion may 16 
officer steve cunningham was the first witness to take the 
stand moments after deputy district attorney steven barshop 
announced he was dismissing one count against christian brando 
possession of a silencer 
christian brando remains charged with murder and a weapons 
violation 
there was standing room only in the courtroom of municipal court 
judge larry fidler who presided over the hearing to decide whether 
there is sufficient evidence to hold christian brando over to trial 
cunningham told of receiving a call to go to the brando 
residence on mulholland drive in west los angeles at 1044 pm 
as he arrived at the gated estate cunningham said he saw 
paramedics and firefighters and i was told there was a guy in the 
house that had been shot in the head and he was dead and the 
suspect was still in the house 
through a window he said he saw drollet lying dead on the 
floor and when he went inside he saw christian and his half 
sister cheyenne who was then seven months pregnant with drollets 
child 
i got approximately three to five feet from the defendant and 
he stated he didnt mean to shoot him cunningham said at 
that time i arrested him 
the defense contends the 45caliber handgun went off 
accidentally during a scuffle over the weapon with drollet 
but authorities say that cheyenne who left for tahiti and 
recently gave birth to drollets child said her brother threatened 
to kill drollet and got a gun the night the boyfriend was shot

the bush administration said today it has 
approved prototypes of six foreignmade semiautomatic rifles 
redesigned to eliminate militarystyle features that resulted in 
their ban as imports last year 
however it was unclear if any requests to import the weapons 
have been submitted or approved said bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms spokesman jack killorin 
receiving approval were new designs of the uzi ak47 galil 
hk91 sar8 and sar4800 officials said the washington post 
first reported the approvals in todays editions citing documents 
obtained by the firearms policy project under the freedom of 
information act 
those rifles were among the 43 styles of semiautomatic 
assaultstyle rifles banned from import by the administration last 
july the weapons had such characteristics as threaded barrels to 
accommodate a silencer flash suppressors that could hide the 
shooters position at night and prevent a loss of night vision 
provisions for mounting a bayonet folding or collapsible stocks 
pistol grips and large capacity magazines 
an administration official speaking on condition that he not be 
identified said weapons of the type recently approved could be 
adapted by the purchaser to add the prohibited features he said 
such features would be prohibited by federal law under a crime bill 
now pending in congress 
earlier white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
apparently the way the existing rules are written atf the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms is not authorized to 
prevent these weapons from coming in 
the new crime bill im told does rectify this problem he 
said we look forward to signing that crime bill 
fitzwater said the guns should not be allowed into the country 
if they are the same weapon that was originally banned and that 
was a circumvention of the rule 
the white house spokesman made the statements in his daily 
questionandanswer session with reporters later he issued a 
statement admitting that he had made a mistake 
the crime bill which the administration proposed limits the 
number of rounds in detachable magazines fitzwater said 
however it will not influence the redesign of weapons within the 
configuration of traditional sporting rifles i was wrong to 
suggest that the new crime bill will influence redesigned weapons 
federal regulations require that imported rifles be suitable to 
sporting purposes and the administration determined that the 43 
styles many of which were favored by drug traffickers did not 
meet that requirement 
nine manufacturers of the banned weapons have provided the atf 
with plans or prototypes of new rifles that eliminate the 
militarystyle accoutrements and the atf has told six that the new 
styles meet the sporting requirement killorin said 
the bottom line is if the firearms conform to the changes 
required without bayonet slugs without flash suppressors night 
sites pistol grips and largecapacity detachable magazines then 
were talking about a weapon consistent with semiautomatic sporting 
weapons killorin said 
since such weapons fit the sporting requirement the atf must 
approve them he said 
the prototypes that were looking at are weapons that have 
none of the accoutrements not even the pistol grip he said 
a pistol grip that hangs down behind the trigger is intended to 
enable the shooter to have control while firing from the hip or to 
fire onehanded from the hip in a combat situation he noted 
although the new designs of the guns do not have such grips 
some are designed with a thumb hole in the stock a configuration 
frequently seen on olympicstyle rifles he said 
josh sugarman of the firearms policy project said the thumb hole 
serves as a pistol grip enabling weapons to be reloaded quickly 
and easily and fired from the hip 
in addition they can be easily modified to full 
assaultweapon configuration he said in a statement 
sugarman noted that the rifles still can accept largecapacity 
magazines even if they are fitted with limited capacity magazines 
something that is true of every firearm that takes a detachable 
magazine according to killorin 
although these weapons may look less threatening they are no 
less deadly sugarman said the industry knows this atf knows 
this and criminals know this 
killorin said the atf was still checking to see if there had 
been any requests to import the new weapons and whether such 
requests have been approved 
our correspondence has been relative to prototype 
configurations rather than a finished product he said 
the majority of our dialogue has been look if we made the 
following changes would this be importable for the most part 
weve said no youd have to change this and this

production of ethanol a cleanburning fuel 
made from corn could triple in the 1990s but only if congress 
offers tax breaks and other benefits a report says 
escalation of ethanol production would be good news to corn 
growers who would see bushel prices climb and to the agriculture 
department which could then spend less on farm subsidies 
but congressional investigators also note some possible 
negatives lower soybean prices higher prices for cattle feed and 
increased costs to consumers who purchase corn in grocery stores 
expanded use of ethanol fuels would have mixed effects on 
various sectors of american agriculture the general accounting 
office said in the report which was released last week gao is the 
investigative arm of congress 
the fuel has great appeal among farmstate lawmakers especially 
this year as congress considers new limits on automobile pollution 
lawmakers tout ethanol as an environmentalists dream and a 
farmers bonanza when gasoline is blended with ethanol harmful 
auto emissions are reduced if the ethanol market picks up growers 
would have another use for their corn 
in 1988 nearly 1 billion gallons of ethanol were produced the 
ethanol industry told gao it could triple output if congress 
dangles some incentives 
for example there is a 9cent tax on each gallon of motor fuel 
but the levy for gasoline made with ethanol is only 3 cents the 
industry would like to keep the 6cent exemption and get passed a 
law that would order the use of alternative fuels 
if production is tripled the industry would enjoy an average 
annual tax break of 813 million through 1997 gao said 
while that might hurt the treasury gao said the greater demand 
for corn would reduce the need to subsidize farmers saving the 
government an average of 142 billion a year

stumped by a bizarre list of chess moves and a 
suspect who wont talk police in lancashire have turned to a chess 
grandmaster to help find a missing woman 
raymond keene chess columnist for the times of london said 
monday he believes he has cracked the code but he hasnt located 
the woman 
her grave keene believes is somewhere northwest of limerick in 
western ireland 
the case is reminiscent of a sherlock holmes story in which 
baffled police turn to the brainy amateur and of lewis carrolls 
lookingglass world of talking chess pieces in which the 
alternation of black and white is perhaps not so strictly 
observed 
police in preston in northwestern england say a suspect has 
told them that 43yearold therese terry is dead and buried 
somewhere in ireland 
detective superindent roy fletcher who enlisted keene as a 
tracer of lost persons said the woman had returned to her native 
lancashire from australia in november after discovering that nearly 
49000 was missing from her bank acount 
she intended to return to australia in january but met a man 
named colin english in london fletcher said 
mrs terry telephoned a friend to say she had changed her plans 
and was in dublin with her boyfriend she was never heard from 
again fletcher said 
english was arrested in june and charged with fraud in 
connection with mrs terrys bank account he said 
while in custody he drew a map which he says gives the answer 
to where she is buried fletcher said he claims she died at 
her own hand 
english wont say where she is buried but drew a blob marked 
with roman numerals accompanied by a series of moves for a black 
king a black queen a black pawn and a white king all pawns 
keene took the black king to be the suspect the black queen to 
be the victim and the pawn to be the suspects brother 
the chart deviated wildly from conventional chess the king 
writes a letter to a lady in waiting black makes all the moves 
the white king all pawns keene believes are the 
police dismissed as no better than a collection of pawns menial 
foot soldiers with no directing stratgegy 
if true this gives an essential clue to the suspects 
psychology one of tremendous intellectual arrogance allied witha 
perverted ingenuity and rooted in the belief that he can dangle all 
sorts of intellectual clues in front of the polices nose without 
their being able to solve them keene wrote in mondays editions 
of the times 
keene wrote that the moves appear to record events between jan 
18 when mrs terry left lancashire for london and jan 23 when 
the suspect returned from ireland he said the moves indicate 
financial transactions that tally with records from mrs terrys 
visa card 
for the 21st the puzzle reads bk plus bq gh bk bp do 
this 
keene believes it means the suspect and his brother inflict 
grievous harm gh on the victim the words do this seem 
particularly sinister in this context 
the blob keene figured is a mirror image of southern ireland 
rotated 90 degrees so that west is at the bottom the numbered 
points he believes refer to places including london and the irish 
cities of dublin limerick and cork 
an arrow points from the numeral keene believes is limerick to 
the letters hg it is my firm belief that the body is located at 
hg some miles probably to the northwest of limerick keene said 
he thought hg might mean her grave or perhaps hallowed 
ground 
police say they will begin searching for the womans body in the 
area identified by keene

three cubans have entered the lightly guarded 
swiss embassy in havana raising to 25 the number seeking asylum in 
european delegations 
the three entered the embassy sunday evening said informed 
sources swiss officials and the mexican government agency notimex 
on monday 
a car pulled up in front of the swiss embassy on sunday evening 
and while the driver distracted the guards in front an 
unidentified cuban entered the building informed sources said a 
short while later two other cubans jumped the fence at the embassy 
compound 
security was light at the swiss embassy but heavy at others 
where cubans have sought refuge or were thought likely to more 
police were dispatched outside the swiss embassy on monday 
notimex said at least 40 police surround the american interest 
section in havana and that security also is heavy around the 
embassies of spain italy west germany and canada 
cuba and the united states do not have embassies in each others 
countries but maintain interest sections under a 1977 agreement 
switzerland which represents the united states in diplomatic 
matters in cuba is the fifth diplomatic mission or residence used 
by cubans for asylum in the past two weeks the us interest 
section is in a different building from the swiss embassy 
in the swiss capital of bern the foreign ministry said it was 
studying the possibility of giving the three temporary refugee at 
the embassy but swiss officials said there is committment to allow 
the three to travel to switzerland or a third country 
the names of the three were not disclosed 
four cubans remain in the residence of the italian ambassador 
cubans who took refuge in the czechoslovak embassy and the home of 
its charge daffairs abandoned attempts at asylum last week 
eighteen cubans remain in the spanish embassy 
spain suspended 25 million in grantsinaid and persuaded the 
european community to put three symbolic projects on hold after 
cuba issued a vitriolic attack on spanish foreign minister 
francisco fernandez ordonez 
fernandez ordonez had said president fidel castro is afraid his 
hardline communist government will fall like those in eastern 
europe if he allows cubans to leave fernandez ordonez also urged a 
transition to democracy in cuba 
cuba has contended the refugeeseekers are part of an 
americaninspired western plot a charge the united states and 
european countries have denied 
the wave of embassy breakins began two weeks ago not long 
after similar incidents were occurring at foreign embassies in 
albania albania like cuba is a hardline communist state

business cable channel cnbc is leaving it and nbc to form an 
independent company that manages broadcast properties he and nbc 
said monday 
no successor was immediately named for 45yearold michael 
eskridge who said he has a nonexclusive agreement to provide 
management and consulting services to ge capital corp whose 
parent company general electric owns nbc 
eskridge was named president of nbcs consumer news and business 
channel based in fort lee nj in july 1988 the service began 
in april 1989 
he said he would stay at cnbc until his replacement is found he 
said he never had any firm plan on how long he would stay at 
the moneylosing company but denied published speculation that he 
was forced out 
eskridge was praised monday in a statement by nbc president 
robert c wright who said he did a phenomenal job in the 
startup of cnbc in my opinion mike is the best executive in 
the industry in startup situations 
he and nbc officials have said that nbc expects to lose money on 
cnbc for three years but predict that it will have 30 million 
subscribers and will start making a profit in its fourth year 
cnbcs main rival in the daytime is the new yorkbased financial

physicians and hospital officials pleaded for 
national health insurance monday saying the burden of treating 
uninsured patients is endangering the healthcare system 
there is mounting evidence that the system is on the verge of 
fiscal collapse said norton j greenberger chairman of the 
department of medicine at the university of kansas medical center 
as many as 37 million americans have no health insurance 
greenberger told the senate subcommittee on health for families and 
the uninsured nearly as many have inadequate or interrupted 
coverage he said 
the number of uninsured rose 43 percent between 1978 and 1986 
greenberger said meanwhile the cost to hospitals of charity care 
and bad debts more than doubled in the last decade accounting for 
5 percent of their expenses 
sen donald riegle dmich the subcommittee chairman said the 
situation underscores the need to develop a national strategy for 
providing health care for all americans it ought to be clear to us 
that the system is breaking down 
however health and human services secretary louis sullivan told 
business leaders in atlanta on monday that the solution to 
americas healthcare problems will be found in a free market where 
businesses arent burdened with requirements 
those who call for a radical revamping of our healthcare 
system suggesting nationalized medicine are mistaken 
sullivan said in his prepared remarks which were made available 
here 
as much as possible we must permit the medical marketplace to 
work he said a dynamic economy will find some solutions on 
its own we do not want to rush in with unproven government 
remedies which may create more problems than they solve 
there are many reasons for the rise in the number of uninsured 
including medicaids failure to keep pace with increasing poverty 
high unemployment in the early 1980s increasing numbers of 
parttime workers with few benefits and small businesses that offer 
no insurance are other causes said e jackson allison jr of pitt 
county memorial hospital in greenville nc 
the senate subcommittee and a bipartisan panel are developing a 
plan to provide universal healthcare coverage and control costs 
riegle said adding that reducing the number of hospitals poses a 
hazard to all americans 
the wealthiest man could be in an automobile accident 
and if theres no room in the hospital all his health insurance 
and wealth dont mean a thing to him he said 
michigan hospitals lost 350 million last year treating patients 
who could not or would not pay said edward thomas president of 
detroit receiving hospital and chairman of the corporate board of 
the michigan hospital association 
especially hard hit are safetynet hospitals in inner 
cities said barbara lord watkins vice president of public affairs 
and human services at dallas parkland memorial hospital 
safetynet hospitals about 300 of the nations 6000 hospitals 
treat disproportionately large numbers of aids patients drug and 
alcohol addicts and victims of violent crime ms watkins said of 
the 90 safetynet hospitals in the national association of public 
hospitals 61 percent reported operating deficits in 1988 she said 
about 12 million children arent covered by health insurance and 
100000 are members of families with such tremendous medical needs 
that their insurance coverage is exhausted said lawrence a 
mcandrews president of childrens mercy hospital of kansas city 
mo 
many such families dont have incomes low enough to qualify for 
medicaid he said a 13yearold boy badly injured in a car 
accident was ineligible for medicaid even though his parents 
combined income totaled only 850 a month mcandrews said

public schools in 13 states are permitted to 
teach about religion and the bible may be taught as literature in 
10 states a new survey finds 
it also shows that 23 states allow excused absences for 
religious holidays and 22 mention observance of a moment of silence 
in their laws or regulations 
the survey was conducted by the national council on religion and 
public education which says its purpose is to provide a forum for 
issues involving religions and public education 
the survey which drew responses from all states except hawaii 
was to determine how many laws regulations or guidelines were on 
the books of states in matters of religion or moral education a 
law or regulation was counted whether it permitted or forbade a 
practice 
teaching about religion in public schools is different from 
teaching religion said charles c haynes of americans united 
research foundation we advocate public discussion about religion 
in public schools he said 
the survey was by charles r kniker assistant dean of education 
at iowa state university 
character and citizenship education was in the practices of 41 
states he said the second most frequently cited curriculum 
category was textbook review procedures in 32 states then 
numerically in 27 states are laws and regulations about state 
textbook selection policies 
in matters of teaching about religion said the survey few 
states are as explicit as alabama which permits religious facts 
only to be discussed many others like alaska have regulations 
that prohibit teaching of sectarian books or doctrines 
on the bible the survey says few states are as specific as 
iowa which says religious books such as the bible the torah 
and the koran shall not be excluded from any public school or 
institution in the state nor shall any child be required to read 
such religious books contrary to the wishes of the childs parents 
or guardian 
in virtually every state with a requirement for the pledge of 
allegiance participation was voluntary the survey said 
kentucky said that the local school boards may encourage 
students to participate in the pledge and also in building respect 
for the flag it added 
wisconsins law was cited as typical in language no student 
shall be compelled against his objections or those of his parents 
or guardian to recite the pledge

the county may administer drug tests to 
applicants for such sensitive jobs as sheriffs deputy 
lifeguard chauffeur and accountant a judge has ruled 
superior court judge david p yaffee ruled last week the county 
may test applicants without unionmanagement talks 
if the county wants to make darn sure that they dont hire a 
drug user for a sensitive position they can do it yaffee said 
in turning down a union request for a preliminary injunction 
the program started july 2 targets certain county jobs that 
pertain to for instance public safety and financial duties so 
far only sheriffs trainees have been submitted to the tests 
a coalition of unions representing 30000 workers had wanted to 
stop the program until the county employee relations commission 
could hear a complaint on the matter 
the unions dont condone drug use but we feel the program 
should not have been implemented without union bargaining said 
alexander cvitan a lawyer for the workers coalition

james meredith the civil rights hero who 
now shuns that title is working on a project to rewrite us 
social legislation as an assistant to sen jesse helms 
meredith said he gave helms rnc an 18inch tall stack of 
proposals when they discussed his joining the senators staff last 
year 
in a nutshell this is what i told them i want to do to 
rewrite domestic policy legislation on the order of the great 
society of lyndon johnson and of the new deal of franklin 
roosevelt meredith said 
to be quite frank no one was willing to say i could do it 
but senator helms was willing to let me try 
merediths journey from civil rights pioneer to the side of an 
archconservative senator isnt as surprising as it might appear 
meredith who broke the color barrier at the university of 
mississippi was an early loner in the civil rights movement 
disillusioned by infighting and unwilling to work with its leaders 
according to former colleagues and a biographer 
he surprised many in the movement five years ago when he 
described integration as a con job and even more when he went 
to work for conservative helms last year but meredith said his 
behavior should not be a shock 
ive been saying the same thing for many years and they have 
been very much aware of my position he said from washington 
dc i operate on the principle that the real attraction to 
senator helms was his commitment to family and morality 
meredith said last week that an elite group of powerful white 
men pull the strings of many black leaders he issued a statement 
on helms official senate stationery accusing naacp delegates of 
involvement in drugs 
meredith said black leaders have been coopted by white liberals 
whose programs are intended to reinforce control over blacks 
until 25 years ago the black race had control of all their 
domestic affairs meredith said that included all of the 
periods of slavery they raised their children 
he said he wants authority returned to families authority that 
white liberals have taken over through social programs 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said merediths statements 
are irrational 
i think hes had a difficult time keeping in touch with 
reality hooks said 
helms is facing a reelection challenge by the man who broke the 
color barrier at clemson university in 1963 former charlotte 
mayor harvey gantt 
democrat gantt has said merediths statement was a way for helms 
to inject race into the campaign without having to personally say 
anything that might be considered to be a racist remark 
helms denied that saying that meredith has a right to speak for 
himself 
at age 27 meredith returned to his native mississippi after 
nine years in the air force to enroll in ole miss some 16000 
troops were called in to quell rioting in which two people were 
killed 
in 1966 meredith took off from his law studies at columbia 
university for a solo march supporting black voter registration in 
mississippi he was shot and wounded on a highway 
civil rights leaders flocked to merediths side and stole the 
limelight said charles evers who took over as the naacps 
mississippi field director after his own brother medgar was 
assassinated in 1963 
evers who manages a jackson miss radio station said he was 
surprised when he found out that meredith joined helms staff 
he always wanted to do the impossible he said and hes 
proved that its not always impossible 
tyrone yates whos working on a biography of meredith said 
meredith was disillusioned by infighting within the movement and 
since his life was on the line he had no time for nonsense 
the year after entering mississippi meredith said intolerance 
and bigotry among civil rights activists endangered the movement 
when he grew up for breakfast lunch and dinner he ate bread 
sopped with molasses yates said he knew what poverty was he 
probably sees these organizations as having advanced white causes 
while ignoring the poor downtrodden blacks

ford motor co agreed monday to pay a 12 
million fine for repeatedly failing to keep track of onthejob 
injuries the government said 
in a separate settlement with the occupational safety and health 
administration ford agreed to launch a program to reduce ergonomic 
hazards or workplace injuries caused by repetitivemotion tasks 
at 96 percent of its plants 
the labor department called that agreement the most extensive 
ergonomics settlement in oshas history a ford spokesman said 
about 150000 workers would be affected 
the 12 million fine involves record keeping violations that 
osha inspectors found in 1989 when they visited a ford electronics 
and refrigeration facility in lansdale pa 
ford was misrecording or failing to record injuries that workers 
had received osha inspectors alleged 
the injuries involved cumulative trauma disorders or disorders 
of the musculoskeletal and nervous systems caused by repetitive 
motions such disorders are common occupational illnesses in the 
automotive industry where workers often have to repeat tasks on 
assembly lines 
ford spokesman dick routh attributed the poor record keeping to 
carelessness 
we had not put the effort into it that we should have 
certainly osha got our attention with the size of the fine he 
added 
osha originally hit ford with a 2 million fine because it was 
the third time the automaker had been cited for record keeping 
violations and ford had failed to live up to an earlier pledge of 
improving procedures the agency said 
as part of the record keeping agreement signed monday ford will 
establish at 12 of its facilities an audit system for keeping 
track of records involving workers medical compensation 
sickness accident and health insurance information 
the company will then cross check the records against an osha 
log and provide record keeping training if the error rate is 
greater than 5 percent either nationwide or at an individual 
facility 
on the ergonomic settlement ford has voluntarily agreed to 
implement a program to reduce workers risks of developing 
cumulative trauma disorders 
several businesses nationwide have taken voluntary steps to 
reduce those types of injuries as osha considers mandating 
ergonomic programs 
labor secretary elizabeth dole in announcing the ford 
agreement said the effort to reduce repetitivemotion injuries 
will be one of the greatest worker health and safety concerns in 
the next decade 
preventive measures include redesigning work stations such as 
adjusting workbench heights redesigning tools training workers 
and using mechanical or other devices to prevent excessive lifting 
fords ergonomic program which will involve analyses of various 
jobs and their risks will be partially administered by the united 
auto workers union which represents ford workers 
last year osha reached a similar ergonomics agreement with 
chrysler and the uaw to control cumulative trauma disorders in five 
chrysler auto assembly plants 
the ford program will include a medical management program to 
provide for early identification of cumulative trauma disorders 
that would include periodic workplace walkthroughs by medical 
staff having workers fill out questionnaires every two years to 
gather information on symptoms of workrelated disorders and 
encouraging employees to report early signs of problems

federal investigators have failed to find the 
cause of a fire blamed for a plane crash that killed a top 
executive of gulf power co the national transportation safety 
board reported monday 
southern company services owner of the plane and a sister 
company of gulf power contended the crash last year was caused by 
a fire set intentionally by the executive senior vice president 
jacob f jake horton 
shortly before the plane took off from the pensacola fla 
regional airport bound for atlanta gulf power officials had 
accused horton of financial irregularities they told him he would 
have to retire resign or be fired 
horton and the two pilots were killed when the plane trailing 
smoke crashed into an apartment building three miles northwest of 
the airport on april 10 1989 
an intense fire after the crash destroyed the plane and the 
building 
the ntsb previously said the fire caused the crash but was 
unable to pinpoint the cause of the fire in its final report on 
the crash the ntsb said its investigators couldnt find evidence 
of a lightning strike an aircraft system malfunction or an 
incendiary device that might have started the fire 
obviously were disappointed that the ntsb has not been able 
to pinpoint the origin of the fire southern company services 
president allen franklin said its unfortunate for our company 
and more importantly for the families of the three men who died 
that questions still remain

the distributor of a film that portrays the death 
of author salman rushdie said monday he will fight a ban by 
britains film board arguing the film is a purely fictional 
the 3hour movie international guerrillas depicts rushdie 
as a bloodthirsty murderer of moslems and ends with divine 
retribution in the last scene rushdie is killed by lightning 
bolts that emanate from the koran floating over his head 
distributor mohammed fayyaz said the film left moslems with a 
sense of satisfaction and calmed their offended feelings 
he said if the appeal before the british board of film 
classification fails he will take the case to court in the 
meantime he will increase efforts to distribute the movie in 
europe and north america he said the film is the most expensive 
ever made in pakistan where ithas played to packed audiences 
rushdie who supports the right of the film to be shown has 
made the same argument for his novel the satanic verses the 
book assailed as blasphemous by some moslems prompted the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran to call for rushdies death in 
february 1989 
the author born to a moslem family in india and now a british 
citizen has been in hiding since feb 14 1989 
fayyaz who has a video shop in south london called the 
punjabiurdu film an imaginative thriller 
if you drop the name salman rushdie then it is just like james 
bond he said 
the film classification board has refused to allow release of 
the film on the ground it was criminally libelous 
james ferman chairman of the film classification board said 
the board had been advised it could be cited as an accessory if 
we were irresponsibly to pass this video 
rushdie said the film deserves the same rights as his book 
the satanic verses was accused of being blasphemous it had 
a judicial review and went through the british courts which decided 
it wasnt blasphemous said frances dsouza who spoke to rushdie 
on monday 
the film should be treated in the same way if it does 
actually infringe british law then action can be taken 
she said censoring the film was a form of prior restraint 
ms dsouza is director of an organization which defends free 
expression and is chairwoman of the international salman rushdie 
defense committee 
she said rushdie unequivocally has said he would not take out 
any proceedings against the film 
fayyaz said 500 pirate copies of international guerrillas 
are already in britain

house democratic leaders and ethics committee 
members geared up monday to defend a proposed reprimand for rep 
barney frank 
however conservative republicans readied moves to stiffen the 
punishment for the massachusetts democrats actions on behalf of a 
male prostitute 
speaker thomas s foley dwash said disciplinary action would 
be considered thursday against frank one of two admitted 
homosexuals in the house 
the 12member ethics panel voted unanimously last week to 
reprimand frank a punishment that would consist of a finding by 
the full house that the congressman brought discredit upon the body 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif already has said however 
that he would propose to expel frank that resolution would need a 
twothirds vote and appears headed for certain defeat 
however a number of other conservative republicans said they 
expect one of their number to propose that frank be censured a 
step higher than a reprimand a censure like a reprimand requires 
a house vote condemning a members behavior but also requires his 
presence while the action is taken 
frank an outspoken liberal in his fifth term is expected to be 
on the floor regardless of the punishment because he has promised 
to apologize to the house 
i believe the committee position will be sustained on the 
floor foley told reporters monday 
house majority whip william h gray iii dpa said when the 
committee comes out with an overwhelmingly bipartisan report the 
membership will say 12 folks are all saying the same thing can 
they be wrong attempts at censure or expulsion will fail 
the committee on standards of official conduct the ethics 
panels formal name concluded in a report released friday that 
frank brought discredit upon the house in two areas of his conduct 
with male prostitute stephen l gobie 
the panel found he used his congressional status for dismissal 
of 33 parking tickets incurred by gobie while not on official 
business frank said he had employed gobie as a personal aide from 
198587 and paid him with personal funds the panel recommended 
that frank make restitution of an unspecified amount to the 
district of columbia for the tickets 
the committee said also that frank wrote a memo that wound up in 
the files of a virginia prosecutor which made misleading 
statements favorable to gobie during his probation gobie had been 
convicted on drug and sex charges 
rep robert s walker rpa said hes aware that some gop 
members are considering a censure of frank and added he would vote 
for such a proposal 
walker said a key factor for those favoring censure would be 
franks initial failure to pay social security taxes on gobies 
salary 
frank told a news conference friday he had erred in apparently 
not withholding social security taxes for gobie apparently when 
you have casual labor like this youre supposed to withhold social 
security tax ive since made those payments there is no other tax 
liability 
walker said the social security tax payments represent a 
serious question that merits a penalty greater than the ethics 
committees recommendation he added that the misleading 
statements by frank during gobies probation was a fairly serious 
offense because hes chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee 
on administrative law 
when you have someone in a powerful position in law 
enforcement lying to law enforcement officials that is something 
we ought to be concerned about walker said

the house voted monday to limit the amount of 
advertising on childrens television shows which one lawmaker 
complained have become the equivalent of a toys r us catalog 
by a voice vote the house approved legislation that also would 
require regulators to weigh in renewing the licenses of television 
stations how well broadcasters are serving the educational needs 
of children 
the bill and a similar measure approved by the senate last week 
would effectively reverse the reagan administrations deregulation 
of the commercial content of childrens tv programming in 1984 
both would limit commercial advertising during childrens 
programming to 10 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an 
hour on weekdays 
proponents claim the restrictions are necessary because many 
children are unable to discriminate between ads and programs until 
they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to recognize a pitch as 
such until they are 7 or 8 
the bush administration opposes the bill particularly the 
provision requiring the fcc to review childrens educational and 
informational programming as part of license renewals the justice 
department has said it will urge president bush to veto the bill 
the house energy and commerce committee estimates the average 
cvisions the national association 
of broadcasters issued a statement last week in general support of 
the legislation 
i think the president will sign it and i think most of the 
parents will stand behind him when he does said peggy charren 
president of action of childrens television an advocacy group 
behind the legislation 
before the bill can be sent to the white house lawmakers still 
have to settle a major difference between the house and senate 
versions 
going a step beyond the house the senate attached a measure by 
sen timothy wirth dcolo that would establish a 10 million 
national endowment for childrens educational television in the 
commerce department 
wirth said the foundation is needed to reverse the trend of 
the 1980s which has seen commercial television broadcasters 
virtually abandon their efforts at childrens educational 
programming 
both bills would require the fcc to complete within six months 
its current inquiry into socalled programlength commercials 
aimed at promoting toys such at gi joe 
charren said there were 70 such shows in effect toy 
commercials many of them series aired by broadcasters in 1986 
prior to the fccs deregulation in 1984 broadcasters had 
followed industry guidelines limiting ads in childrens programming 
to 9 minutes an hour on weekends and 12 minutes an hour on 
weekdays 
since then according to the house committee advertising on 
many saturday morning childrens shows has crept up to 11 minutes 
an hour

israeli officials are debating whether to 
restrict immigration laws to curb the influx of tens of thousands 
of soviet jews who are severely taxing the countrys housing market 
and social services 
the question of amending the law of return or who is a jew 
law was argued monday on radio broadcasts and in newspapers 
almost two years ago proposals to amend the law which grants 
automatic citizenship to all jews provoked outrage among american 
jews who said changes would alienate conservative and reform jews 
who together form a majority of american jewry 
michael kleiner chairman of parliaments immigration committee 
has claimed the immigration laws are exploited by soviet nonjews 
he seeks to change a 1970 amendment to the law that grants 
automatic citizenship to the child grandchild or spouse of a jew 
as well as the spouse of his child or grandchild 
kleiner claims that if this ammendment is not revised it would 
entitle at least 5 million soviet nonjews to israeli citizenship 
and immigration benefits 
their immigration would more than double the population of 
israel 
kleiner has said he wants to exclude descendants of jewish 
grandfathers unless the family arrives with the grandfather 
if this really becomes a trend and millions of nonjews use 
their jewish grandfather to escape from the soviet union this will 
endanger the jewish nature of israel kleiner said in an 
interview last week 
housing minister ariel sharon head of the governments 
immigration committee reportedly told the cabinet sunday he will 
oppose any changes in the law because we are dealing with an 
emergency situation with jews running from the soviet union 
what we must do is open the gates of the homeland to the jewish 
people 
legislator uriel lynn lashed out at kleiner monday 
this change may divide families and create panic and anxiety 
among potential immigrants it has elements of racism and would 
present our country as racist lynn said in an interview 
eugene sukholtzky head of the jewish culture club in baku 
soviet central asia told the israeli daily haaretz we know 
nonjews are buying documents that they are jewish and we also 
have the widespread problem of mixed marriages 
but he added that requiring grandfathers to come to israel could 
be unfair to some immigrants because of the biological reason 
that their grandparents are no longer alive and they have no other 
proof that they are jewish 
israels orthodox establishment has long fought to change the 
law of return so it conforms to orthodox jewish law that law 
states that a jew is one who is born to a jewish mother or 
converted according to orthodox jewish law 
this proposal enraged american jews because it would mean all 
nonorthodox converts would be considered nonjews in israel 
interior minister arye deri a member of the sephardic torah 
guardian or shas party has refused to comply with a supreme court 
order to recognize nonorthodox conversions he now backs kleiners 
effort to change the law 
more than 12 million soviets have requested visa applications 
as jews according to the quasigovernment jewish agency 
since 1989 74000 soviet jews have arrived in israel and the 
number is expected to reach 150000 this year social services are 
already overloaded and a housing shortage is fast developing

another line of defense has been completed in 
texas against africanized honeybees moving north out of mexico 
toward the united states the agriculture department said monday 
james w glosser head of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service said the bees have not yet entered the 
united states but are expected to do so between late summer and 
next spring 
glosser said four interconnected trap lines have been completed 
in south texas to capture and track swarms as they move north out 
of mexico 
the bees are hybrid offspring of african bees brought to brazil 
in 1956 some escaped and mated with native bees 
africanized bees can be aggressive when threatened and swarm 
quickly against an intruder this characteristic has contributed to 
their notoriety as killer bees which usda officials blame on 
horror movies and exaggerated news reports 
in reality the chances of being injured by an africanized or 
any honeybee are far less than the chances of being hit by 
lightning says a recent background paper on the bees 
glosser said the four trap lines are located north of 
brownsville texas near the gulf coast the northernmost line has 
more than 40 traps and runs about 50 miles from sarita to 
raymondville 
an intersecting line has about 60 traps and extends 80 miles 
from la gloria to port mansfield on the coast another with about 
30 traps extends about 30 miles south of la gloria to rio grande 
city the fourth with about 60 traps runs parallel to the coast 
for about 60 miles from san perlita to port isabel

appellate bench earlier this year suggesting his hopes that the 
nomination might not trigger a political freeforall in the senate 
i look forward to a fair and expeditious confirmation 
process bush said 
bush was asked if he knows souters views on abortion or other 
difficult issues 
bush said he felt it would have been inappropriate and that 
he did not ask him his views on any specific issues 
judge souter is committed to interpreting not making the 
law bush said 
i have selected a person who will interpret the constitution 
and in my view not legislate from the bench bush said

us sen tim wirth sent the state of colorado a 
check monday for 98950 all the money contributed to his 
campaign committee by savings and loan industry figures and sampl 
customers who failed to repay major loans 
the list of donors includes three key figures in the controversy 
over the collapse of silverado banking which was closed by federal 
regulators in 1988 the presidents son neil bush was a silverado 
director 
recent scandals surrounding the industry have contaminated 
these contributions wirth said in a news statement therefore 
they have no place in my campaign past present or future 
among the donors were ken good the denver developer who 
allegedly defaulted on at least 31 million in loans from 
silverado michael wise the former silverado president and denver 
developer bill walters who allegedly defaulted on 106 million in 
silverado loans good donated 9000 to wirth wise 3100 
walters 3500 
wise also raised money for republican presidential candidate 
george bush in 1987 by helping sponsor a dinner for bush that 
reportedly brought in 300000 in contributions the presidents 
son denver oilman neil bush was a silverado director from 1985 to 
1988 when wise was the thrifts president 
wise also raised money for republican presidential candidate 
george bush in 1987 by helping sponsor a fundraising dinner that 
reportedly brought in 300000 
the colorado democrat said the check to the state department of 
revenue represents all contributions made by these parties to the 
wirth campaign committee since 1980 
dorothy dahlquist a spokeswoman for the revenue department 
said officials had yet to decide if the money would go into the 
general fund or used for a specific purpose 
at the time these contributions were made which over the 
years have comprised less than 2 percent of all monies raised 
there was no reason to suspect any wrongdoing wirth said 
on the contrary these donors were wellrecognized as leaders 
of their communities precisely the kinds of people from whom 
anyone seeking public office would hope to solicit political and 
financial support 
but he said the sampl scandal has changed his opinion of those 
contributors 
by its magnitude persistence and unfairness the sampl scandal 
has shaken public trust in government said wirth coloradans 
are angry and i share their anger 
a relative handful of greedy and unprincipled individuals 
using the tools of an unregulated industry in an overly permissive 
financial environment have ripped off millions of americans he 
said the guilty parties must be brought to justice our 
financial institutions must again be made safe and sound and 
perhaps most important the pact between people and their 
institutions of selfgovernment must be reconfirmed 
the list of wirth campaign contributors whose money was turned 
over to the state showed 22650 from people affiliated with 
columbia savings and loan of beverly hills calif and 11000 from 
figures linked to the bankrupt american continental corp of 
arizona both of which have battled federal regulators 
also listed was 8700 from the us league of savings 
associations pac and 8250 from donors affiliated with mercury 
savings of huntington beach calif the other returned 
contributions were for amounts 5000 or less

oil futures contract hasnt been that high since april traders 
said 
ministers from the 13member organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are scheduled to meet thursday 
the market is simply gaining more and more confidence that 
opec is going to come up with a viable settlement here said bob 
baker who follows the energy futures markets for prudentialbache 
securities inc 
baker said crude oil prices have been rising for the past 12 
sessions since the september contract for west texas intermediate 
was trading at below 17 a barrel 
robert murphy vice president in the international energy 
futures group at shearson lehman hutton inc said that as the opec 
meeting approaches the more it looks likely they are going to 
keep their promise of last week 
he said traders are anticipating opec will cut its production to 
225 million barrels a day from current production of more than 23 
million barrels 
but he warned that there is still a glut in the us oil 
inventory and that you never know how inventory figures to be 
released tuesday will affect prices 
prices for refined products traded on the merc also rose taking 
their cues from movements in the crude contracts 
unleaded regular gasoline for august delivery rose 039 cent to 
6335 cents a gallon while later contract months up by similar

motorists in seattle are burning the dirtiest 
gasoline according to a consumer survey released monday that also 
said chevron brands nationwide contain on average the most 
cancercausing benzene 
the survey found widely different levels of toxic aromatics 
especially benzene in gasoline depending on regions of the 
country premium gasoline sold in miami contained a third as much 
benzene as the same gasoline sold in seattle 
earl ross spokesman for the american petroleum institute said 
such variations werent unusual 
gasolines are blended differently for different parts of the 
country because of differences in driving conditions climate 
altitude and seasonal changes he said 
benzene and other socalled aromatic additives which are 
used to boost gasoline octane are highly toxic and can cause 
cancer studies have indicated cleanair legislation before 
congress would require significant reductions in the use of those 
additives by refiners 
health specialists are concerned primarily about exposure to the 
toxic vapors during refueling although the petroleum industry has 
said such exposure is at such low levels that it does not warrant a 
health concern 
the environmental protection agency has estimated that there are 
about eight chances in 100000 of a person developing cancer from 
selfservice refueling of motor vehicles over a lifetime the epa 
said the risk is greater for those who live near or work at 
gasoline stations terminals or refineries 
the survey of gasoline sold in 18 metropolitan areas was 
produced by citizen action a washingtonbased consumer and 
environmental group and was based on fuel samples tested annually 
by the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
the american petroleum institute accused citizen action of 
misusing data to present an unduly alarmist picture of the 
health risks to motorists 
the citizens action study showed that premium gasoline sold in 
the west generally contained higher levels of aromatics including 
benzene an exception appeared to be atlanta where the level of 
benzene in premium gasoline 29 percent was second only to 
seattle 3 percent 
shell premium gasoline sold in atlanta had the highest benzene 
content of any gasoline tested or 54 percent shell in recent 
months has touted the benefits of clean gasoline when promoting its 
reformulated premium su2000e brand 
but other gasoline brands in other cities also showed high 
levels of benzene exxons premium in los angeles and chevrons 
premium in san francisco contained more than 36 percent benzene 
this is gasoline at its dirtiest said edwin rothschild 
energy policy director for citizen action 
by comparison the average benzene content in gasoline is 
slightly more than 2 percent cleanair legislation in the final 
stages of being approved by congress calls for refiners to limit 
their benzene levels to less than 1 percent and overall aromatic 
levels to 25 percent 
the citizen action survey showed that some gasoline brands 
already meet the anticipated cleanair requirement 
in miami where average benzene levels in premium gasoline were 
only 1 percent mobils premium had a benzene level of onehalf of 
1 percent and three other brands union amoco and exxon all 
contained well below 1 percent benzene premium brands from exxon 
amoco and texaco had similar levels in dallas washington dc and 
denver 
obviously oil companies are capable of manufacturing premium 
unleaded gasoline with less than 08 percent benzene rothschild 
said at a news conference 
gasoline from the same company can have widely different levels 
of benzene depending on region and type of gas the survey showed 
for example while texaco sold premium gasoline with 067 percent 
benzene in denver its regular gasoline sold in boston had nearly 5 
percent benzene content 
rothschild said the controversial additives should be eliminated 
we are appalled that companies like chevron and shell have the 
audacity to tell the public that they sell quality gasoline when in 
many cities they are the purveyors of the most toxic gasoline on 
the market he said

president bush said monday he will nominate 
appellate judge david souter to a seat on the supreme court if 
confirmed by the senate the 50yearold jurist from new hampshire 
would succeed william j brennan 
he is a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest 
ability bush said the president went on to praise brennan as 
well calling the courts longtime leading liberal one of the 
greatest figures of his age brennan resigned last friday 
souter stood at bushs side as the president made his surprise 
announcement at the white house late in the afternoon the 
president said he decided on souter earlier in the afternoon 
bush said his quick selection was not geared to abortion policy 
or any other single issue it is not appropriate to use any 
litmus test bush said abortion activists believe brennans 
departure from the court could pave the way for overturning the 
1973 roe vs wade decision 
i hope you will understand that i think i must defer any 
comments on court issues souter said until senate confirmation 
hearings begin he said it would take him all night to describe 
what an honor bush had conferred on him 
the nomination now goes to the senate where a simple majority is 
required for confirmation 
souter was appointed by bush earlier this year to the 1st us 
circuit court of appeals previously he was a member of the new 
hampshire state supreme court appointed to that post in 1983 by 
thengov john sununu now bushs chief of staff souter succeeded 
sen warren rudman rnh as the states attorney general 
brennan 84 one of the most liberal members of an increasingly 
conservative court and one of the most influential justices of the 
20th century told bush on friday that he was resigning because of 
declining health 
he had served on the high court for 34 years he was appointed 
by president dwight d eisenhower 
brennans health started to deteriorate in the last year he 
recently fell at the newark international airport and struck his 
head a supreme court spokeswoman said and after consulting with 
his doctors he decided to step down 
bush acted with unusual speed in making his choice 
he met twice over the weekend with his top lieutenants and 
called the democratic and republican leaders of congress to seek 
advice 
bush noted that souter had won unanimous confirmation to the 
appellate bench earlier this year suggesting his hopes that the 
nomination might not trigger a political freeforall in the senate 
were not bracing for some horrendous fight with the united 
states senate bush said 
i look forward to a fair and expeditious confirmation 
process 
bush was asked if he knows souters views on abortion or other 
difficult issues 
bush said he felt it would have been inappropriate and that 
he did not ask him his views on any specific issues 
judge souter is committed to interpreting not making the 
law bush said 
i have selected a person who will interpret the constitution 
and in my view not legislate from the bench bush said 
a questioner noted that bush and sununu both have widely known 
views against abortion and asked why people shouldnt think that 
souters abortion view was known to bush through research or some 
other method 
i told you its not bush said 
most of his writings have been at the state level bush said 
of souters judicial record indicating that his views on such 
tough federal issues as affirmative action or free speech might not 
be well developed 
in a 1986 case before the new hampshire supreme court souter 
ruled with the majority that doctors have a responsibility to test 
for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of 
abortion 
we recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves 
controversial and divisive social issues said the opinion 
nonetheless the supreme court of the united states has held that 
a woman has a constitutionally secured right to terminate a 
pregnancy 
in a concurring opinion souter questioned the impact the 
decision would have on doctors who didnt support abortion the 
court does not hold that some or all physicians must make a choice 
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving 
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures he 
wrote 
bush brushed off a question about the possibility of a 
liberalvsconservative confirmation battle saying i dont 
control the senate 
he said he did not view the brennan vacancy or the prospect of 
replacing others among the elderly cast on the ninemember court 
as an opportunity to put some personal bush imprint on the 
court 
im not interested in having this known as a bush court the 
president said 
bush said the process of screening candidates for a potential 
vacancy had been going on for some time but not with brennan in 
mind he said white house counsel boyden gray had played a key role 
in the preliminary research and at one point he denied that sununu 
had played an undue role in the process that ended with souters 
selection 
its a process that has been going on for some time and the 
excellence was just there bush said

here is the text of president bushs 
announcement monday of his intention to nominate david souter to 
the supreme court 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
my oath to the constitution charges me to faithfully execute the 
office of president and to the best of my ability preserve 
protect and defend the constitution of the united states few 
duties are more important in discharging that obligation than my 
responsibility under article 2 section 2 of our constitution to 
select from among all possible choices one nominee to fill a 
vacancy on the supreme court of the united states 
the task of narrowing the selection to one highly qualified 
jurist committed to the rule of law and faithful to the 
constitution could never be easy but i have found it enormous 
enormously satisfying my choice will serve the court and the 
constitution well 
i am most pleased to announce that i will nominate as associate 
justice of the united states supreme court a remarkable judge of 
keen intellect and the highest ability one whose scholarly 
commitment to the law and whose wealth of experience mark him of 
first rank judge david souter of the united states court of 
appeals for the first circuit 
judge souter i believe with all my heart will prove a most 
worthy member of the court his tenure as an associate justice of 
the supreme court of the state of new hampshire as attorney 
general of that state and more recently as a federal appeals 
judge unquestionably demonstrates his ability his integrity and 
his dedication to public service and he has a keen appreciation of 
the proper judicial role rooted in fundamental belief and 
separation of powers and the democratic principles underlying our 
great system of government 
let me pay tribute too to the justice whose retirement from 
the court created the vacancy justice william brennan his 
powerful intellect his winning personality and importantly his 
commitment to civil discourse on emotional issues that at times 
tempt uncivil voices have made him one of the greatest figures of 
our age 
no one can question his dedication to the nation and the energy 
that he has brought to his high office his retirement is marked by 
the dignity and honor that characterized his 34 years of service on 
the bench and i told him the other day when i talked to him of the 
respect that mrs bush and i have for him for his wonderful service 
in choosing to nominate judge souter who like justice brennan 
is largely a product of the state court system i have looked for 
the same dedication to public service and strength of intellect 
exemplified by justice brennan 
my selection process was not geared simply to any legal issue 
it is not appropriate in choosing a supreme court justice to use 
any litmus test and i want a justice who will ably and fairly 
interpret the law across the range of issues the court faces our 
country serves as a model for the world at a time of special 
significance and i stressed within the white house to the attorney 
general that our process could not be dominated by politics or 
special interests and i believe that weve set a good example of 
selecting a fair arbiter of the law 
judge souter will bring to the court a wealth of judicial 
experience on the supreme court of his state and before that as a 
state trial court judge prior to his appointment to the state 
bench he was attorney general of the state of new hampshire 
judge souter is a graduate of the harvard law school phi beta 
kappa graduate of harvard college he was also a rhodes scholar 
my respect for his outstanding record led me earlier this year 
to nominate him to his present position on the court of appeals 
the senate unanimously confirmed him to that position because of 
his exceptional qualities and his experience 
his opinions reflect a clean intellect keen intellect as well 
as wise balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of 
the law judge souter committed to interpreting not making the 
law he recognizes the proper role of judges in upholding the 
democratic choices of the people through their elected 
representatives with constitutional constraints 
judge brennans retirement took effect last friday the court is 
now reduced to eight members it is important to restore the bench 
to full strength by the first monday in october when the court 
begins its 1990 term i look forward to presenting judge souters 
nomination to the senate as quickly as possible and i look forward 
as well to a fair and expeditious confirmation process

marion barrys lawyers monday attacked the 
credibility of an admitted cocaine dealer who said she delivered 
crack to the mayor at a municipal office in 1988 
barrys lawyers said at his cocaine and perjury trial that the 
mayor has an alibi for the time of the alleged delivery sept 7 
1988 prosecutors contend barrys alibi is nonexistent 
testifying for the defense city employee clifton roberson said 
he accepted a job application from lydia pearson on sept 7 1988 
pearson testified earlier in barrys trial that she handed the 
mayor crack cocaine he gave me the money for it i gave 
him the job application 
roberson who works for mayoral aide anita bonds said pearson 
came to the office on sept 7 1988 and was annoyed that neither 
barry nor bonds was there roberson said he accepted the job 
application from pearson who then left 
roberson said on crossexamination by prosecutors that he had no 
idea whether pearson might have met with barry after leaving the 
office 
earlier defense lawyer r kenneth mundy suggested that the 
mayor has an alibi for the time the government alleges pearson was 
bringing him crack cocaine 
a former city aide and the city fire chief testified that the 
mayor was addressing problems involving ambulance service in the 
district of columbia on the morning of sept 7 1988 
the building where the crack delivery allegedly occurred is 
about five blocks from fire department headquarters where the 
meeting on ambulance problems was held 
barry was in the scheduled 10 am meeting until nearly noon 
that day joseph yeldell former director of the office of 
emergency preparedness said under questioning from mundy 
but barry was late to the meeting yeldell said 
how late asked mundy 
i cant be specific said yeldell but a slight delay of 
the meeting resulted from barrys tardiness 
fire chief ray alfred said he was uncertain whether barry got to 
the meeting on time 
yeldell said barry was in the meeting for as much as an hour and 
20 minutes alfred said barry spoke for about an hour possibly an 
hour and a half 
the meeting is videotaped and a clock on the wall shows that 
barry left the room eight or nine minutes before noon said 
assistant us attorney judith retchin the clock isnt visible 
when barry walks in she indicated 
in the videotape barry apologizes for being late and says he 
has been delayed by the opening of a new supermarket said retchin 
she said prosecutors plan to show the videotape in its rebuttal 
case after mundy concludes the defense case 
pearsons testimony for sept 7 1988 forms the basis for one 
of 10 cocaine possession charges to which barry has pleaded 
innocent barry also has pleaded innocent to one count of 
conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury

the bush administration has told manufacturers 
of six semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles banned from import last 
summer that new revised versions of the weapons conform to us 
laws officials said monday 
we have approved prototypes and said if you manufacture this 
weapon for import it would be approved said jack killorin 
spokesman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
the bureau was not immediately aware of whether the 
manufacturers or importers of such weapons as the uzi carbine and 
the ak47 had sought permits to bring in any of the new weapons he 
said since the new designs lack the militarystyle hardware of the 
banned weapons gun fanciers may not want them and the 
manufacturers may decide not to bother producing them he said 
they have to ask whether what were asking for is a marketable 
item killorin said 
the bush administration last summer banned from import 43 types 
of semiautomatic assaultstyle rifles that ban followed an outcry 
over the january 1989 slayings of five elementary school children 
in stockton calif by a transient wielding an ak47 in addition 
law enforcement officials had complained that the weapons were 
extremely popular among drug dealers 
the atf justified the ban by saying the weapons did not meet the 
legal requirement that imported rifles be suitable for sporting 
purposes 
the banned guns had such militarystyle characteristics as 
threaded barrels for silencers flash suppressors that could hide 
the shooters position at night bayonet lugs folding or 
collapsible stocks pistol grips and large capacity ammunition 
magazines 
receiving approval for new versions of banned weapons were the 
makers of the uzi carbine ak47 galil hk91 sar8 and 
sar4800 according to documents obtained by the firearms policy 
project through the freedom of information act the washington post 
reported on the issue in mondays editions 
killorin said the proposed weapons have different designs as 
well as numerical designations 
the prototypes that were looking at are weapons that have 
none of the accoutrements not even the pistol grip killorin 
said the bottom line is if the firearms conform to the changes 
required without bayonet lugs without flash suppressors night 
sites pistol grips and largecapacity detachable magazines then 
were talking about a weapon consistent with semiautomatic sporting 
weapons 
under the regulations atf must approve the weapons he said 
but a firearms policy project official responded although 
these weapons may look less threatening they are no less deadly 
than those banned from import last year 
the industry knows this atf knows this and criminals know 
this josh sugarmann said 
and sen howard m metzenbaum dohio said we are either 
going to keep these weapons of war off our streets or we are not 
this is no area for halfhearted nonsense 
although the new designs do not include pistol grips which 
give the shooter control while firing from the hip or while firing 
onehanded some have a thumb hole in the stock which sugarmann 
said can serve as a pistol grip 
in addition sugarmann said the rifles still can accept 
largecapacity magazines even if they are fitted with limited 
capacity magazines that is true of every firearm that accepts a 
detachable magazine according to killorin 
an administration official speaking on condition that he not be 
identified said purchasers of the newstyle weapons could adapt 
them to add the prohibited features he said such features would be 
prohibited by federal law under a crime bill now pending in 
congress 
we look forward to signing that crime bill white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
killorin said the atf has rejected prototypes submitted by three 
manufacturers of banned guns

q did you ask judge souter his views on abortion do you know 
what his views are and affirmative action all of these things 
that have become so controversial the major issues of the day 
bush no and i had one meeting with judge souter i was very 
impressed but in my view it would have been inappropriate to ask 
him his views on specific issues this process has been going on 
this selection process not with any specific seat in mind but 
just being prepared for a long long time judge souter was 
considered for the high court back when mr justice kennedy was 
selected and so theres a lot and then of course his name was 
very much in the forefront when he was nominated and subsequently 
confirmed for the appeals court 
so i am familiar with him with his his general views but i 
did not and would not as i think ive said before when i talked 
about not just here but other times the litmus test approach 
i wouldnt go into that with him 
q does that mean you do not care what he thinks on the 
bush it means that i have selected a person who will interpret 
the constitution and in my view not legislate from the federal 
bench 
q mr president barely three days have passed since you 
learned of justice brennans resignation why did you move so 
quickly on this appointment and you also called the leaders of 
congress and others over the weekend for their advice when did 
you come to the choice of justice souter 
bush i came to the choice this afternoon and wanted to i 
think i told the leaders that i talked to over the weekend that i 
wanted to move very fast as i said this isnt precipitous in the 
sense that we just started looking for names last saturday i 
remember meeting with the attorney general and boyden gray perhaps 
within the first month i was president at least the first two 
months and ive had a couple of meetings with them and theyve 
been in discussion with each other for a long time on this and so 
just the prudence would dictate that one be prepared lest there be 
a vacancy so weve been talking about who i might want to appoint 
for a long time 
q sir if i could follow up youre not certain in your own 
mind how justice souter will vote if roe v wade comes before the 
court next term 
bush what im certain of is that he will interpret the 
constitution and not legislate from the federal bench 
yes 
q but mr president i believe judge souter is about 50 years 
old and many of the candidates you considered were younger than 
the current justices what kind of lasting legacy do you want to 
leave on the supreme court do you expect this to be a longterm 
shifting of the center of balance for the court 
bush im not looking hes in good health i was looking over 
there to see how hes looking at 50 but he seems to be in very 
vigorous health and i would expect hed serve a long term on the 
bench and im not viewing this as some personal bush imprint 
on the court i have pledged to get to seek out excellence and 
ive pledged to look for somebody who would interpret the 
constitution and im satisfied ive found the very best in that 
regard 
q do you expect the court would shift to the right 
philosophically 
bush i havent put it in terms of shifting left or right i 
read a great deal of speculation about all that but all im saying 
is that weve got a nominee here who is extraordinarily 
intelligent has a record has been confirmed by the senate and 
who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level as to his 
objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy and i am satisfied 
as to all those counts 
q mr president as you know the whole issue of abortion has 
over this choice is major do you know if this judge has written 
on this issue has is he does he have a record on this issue 
that either side can point to to make it an even bigger issue or 
is he is it unknown and therefore more difficult to get at 
bush in the first place i think it would be inappropriate 
although ill let him make up his own mind for justice souter to 
make any comments on any specific issue out of the respect for the 
senate i would urge that he not do that any specific questions on 
specific issues should be addressed in an orderly confirmation 
process by the senate but beyond that leslye i you know i 
think what i said earlier responds to your question 
q no i you said you hadnt asked him but i wonder if he has 
a record if 
bush well i dont know about that i didnt consider that as 
i thought i made clear yeah jerry and then 
q mr president since you concluded that its inappropriate to 
ask about a specific case like roe versus wade do you also 
therefore consider it to be inappropriate for the senate committee 
thatll do the confirmation to ask about a specific case like that 
bush i would let the senate do whatever they want theyre a 
separate and independent body of the of our government and there 
are certain precedents for how they approach these issues but im 
listen ive got enough problems down here without trying to tell 
the senate how to conduct its confirmation hearing ive been 
handed a protocol note marlin fitzwater whos not known for his 
protocol but i he says it would be most appropriate to let judge 
souter respond at this juncture so with your permission well 
proceed 
judge souter thank you mr president im really not sure how 
to do that if it were possible for me to express to you the 
realization that i have of the honor which the president has just 
done me i would try and i would keep you here as long tonight as i 
had to do to get it out but i could not express that realization 
and im not going to try to do the impossible beyond that i hope 
you will understand that i think i must defer any further comments 
of mine until i am before the senate in the confirmation process

rival shiite moslem forces on monday 
reinforced their front lines around a strategic mountaintop town 
in southern lebanon as thousands of civilians took advantage of a 
lull in the fighting to flee 
police reported a marked decrease in fighting between fighters 
of the proiranian fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god and 
the syrianbacked amal militia 
the lull occurred as the battle between the rival shiite 
factions for control of the strategic town of jarjou and nearby 
villages close to israels selfdesignated security zone in 
southern lebanon entered its second week 
police said a syrian combatant was killed and two amal 
militiamen were wounded in daylong sporadic exchanges of artillery 
and sniper fire 
the dead fighter was identified by police as a syrian who 
belonged to the damascusbased arab baath socialist party about 
200 baathists and a symbolic force of the syrian social nationalist 
party have been fighting alongside the amal militia 
israeli jets made repeated reconnaissance flights monday over 
southern lebanon to monitor the shiite fighting police said 
mondays casualties raised the toll to 126 people killed and 369 
wounded since the shiite fighting broke out anew on july 16 
the fighting began when hezbollah attacked and seized jarjou 
from amal in an effort to expand its area of control toward the 
mediterranean and open up a badly needed sea route to iran its 
main supplier of arms 
it was the latest round of fighting in a 3yearold intermittent 
conflict between amal and hezbollah for mastery of the countrys 
12 million shiite moslems who make up lebanons largest sect 
at least 1167 people have been killed and 4011 wounded in the 
inconclusive power struggle by police count 
police said palestine liberation organization guerrillas 
stationed between the amal and hezbollah forces in the disputed 
region occupied four new hilltop positions west of jarjou on 
sunday 
the palestinian force is now capable of preventing any advance 
from either side against each other said lt col anwar madi 
commander of the plo intervention force as he inspected his 
positions around jarjou monday 
plo fighters mainly from yasser arafats fatah faction have 
been trying to stop the fighting between the two shiite groups 
apparently to halt the hezbollah advance toward sidon a southern 
port where palestinian guerrillas are based it is 10 miles 
northwest of jarjou 
amal and plo guerrillas fought a threeyear war in lebanon 
between 1985 and 1988 but have joined together in attacks aimed at 
driving the hezbollah forces out of jarjou 
police said amal rushed in 1000 more militiamen with dozens of 
truckloads of ammunition to its positions around jarjou over the 
weekend amal already had about 6500 frontline fighters in iqlim 
altuffah or the apple province where the fighting is raging 
hezbollah set up several additional artillery and mortar 
batteries in jarjou police said the fundamentalist group has 
fielded at least 2000 fighters in the province 
the reinforcements caused panic among the regions remaining 
25000 inhabitants who fear the fighting might intensify 
long lines of fleeing villagers trudged through the rugged 
hills carrying their household belongings under their arms and on 
their heads 
most of them sought refuge in southern lebanons major cities of 
sidon tyre and nabatiyeh others fled to open fields sleeping at 
night in cars

about 150000 people took part in a 
funeral procession monday to pay their respects to former bulgarian 
communist leader georgi dimitrov whose remains were removed from 
his mausoleum last week 
the remains of dimitrov revered as national hero during four 
decades of communist rule were cremated after being transferred 
from the mausoleum in downtown sofia 
both the opposition and some members of the ruling socialist 
party had called for removing dimitrovs remains and converting the 
mausoleum to other uses critics argue the mausoleum is a relic of 
the past out of step with the countrys recent push toward 
democracy 
the mostly elderly crowd many of whom had come from the 
countryside walked about three miles in the funeral procession 
from a square in front of alexander nevski cathedral to sofias 
central cemetery where a memorial ceremony was held 
the observances were organized by the socialists the reform 
party created from the old communist party 
as the funeral procession passed through the streets of the 
capital some young people on the sidewalks whistled in apparent 
disapproval no incidents were reported 
addressing the crowd at the funeral ceremony alexander lilov 
the socialist party leader appealed to party members to close 
their ranks on the way to radical renewal and reform 
lets transform the bulgarian socialist party into a model of 
a modern leftwing party lilov said 
lilov said the removal of dimitrovs remains and their burial at 
a public cemetery did not represent any major historical revision 
regarding the countrys first communist leader the state bta news 
agency reported 
he is still considered a political figure of enormous national 
and international prestige but he was not faultless and 
made some mistakes lilov said 
also attending the ceremony were other senior socialist party 
officials including premier andrei lukanov and former president 
petar mladenov who resigned earlier this month 
the urn with dimitrovs ashes will be buried in a family grave 
in a private ceremony for relatives later this week a bta official 
said 
a leading figure in the international communist movement 
dimitrov was acquitted in a trial in late 1933 in which he was 
charged with complicity in the fire that destroyed the german 
reichstag parliament building 
historians say that the arson was a nazi provocation 
in 1946 dimitrov became leader of the bulgarian communist party 
and also headed the government until his death in 1949 
during his leadership the noncommunist opposition parties were 
either disbanded or merged in a communistdominated mass 
organization 
the disinterment of dimitrov marks another step away from four 
decades of orthodox communist rule since the ouster of communist 
leader todor zhivkov in november 
despite longtime official veneration dimitrov has become 
increasingly unpopular particularly in sofia where the 
noncommunist opposition union of democratic forces emerged as the 
winner in last months multiparty elections the socialists won a 
majority in the parliament due to a strong showing in the 
countryside and provincial cities 
a commission appointed by sofias municipal council will propose 
possible new uses for the former mausoleum a massive stone 
building constructed in one week after dimitrovs death 
in the past the mausoleum was a major attraction in sofia much 
like lenins tomb in moscow 
the mausoleum was guarded around the clock by two soldiers in 
traditional balkanstyle dress uniform equipped with 
bayonettopped rifles

q conservatives recently have expressed some disappointment 
with your what they call the flipflop on no new tax pledge 
your position on china lithuania and the like and governor 
sununu is recognized as the champion of the conservatives in the 
white house is his connection is the judges connection to 
governor sununu is this meant as an appeasement to the 
conservative right do you think it will appease them 
bush sununus got problems with his own credentials i mean 
hes not going to help on that and thats not what this is all 
about this matter as ive indicated was there was almost a 
certain recusal on the part of governor sununu on this clearly he 
knows judge souter he has great respect for judge souter but this 
process as im sure boyden gray and dick thornburgh will tell you 
came up through a system excellence came to the top and so 
there is no politics of this nature in this kind of a this kind 
of an appointment if i was looking to shore up one factor or 
another thered be plenty of more visible ways to do it here we 
are talking about excellence judicial excellence and the highest 
degree of qualification based on excellence to be on the court 
q mr president earlier today marlin fitzwater said that 
whomever you chose as your candidate your nominee would reflect 
your general philosophy of government is it still your philosophy 
that roe vs wade the abortion law should be overturned 
bush look you all can keep trying all day long to get me to 
comment on abortion in relation to this nomination and please keep 
stop trying because im not going to respond in that vein it 
would be unfair to judge souter it would be untrue because i 
havent looked at the nomination in that manner and so i simply 
cannot and you get another question though instead 
q well my other question would simply be just not respond in 
the connection with judge souter how about just your own personal 
philosophy 
bush i havent changed my views if that helps any 
q mr president im still not totally certain by why you feel 
it was inappropriate to ask the judges views on the issues 
bush because thats i understand thats the customary way of 
doing it and that more important are the broad concepts of 
excellence is the man qualified does he share a broad view that 
what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the constitution and 
not legislate and so thats all i need and when you see the 
background of this man im confident the senate will share my 
views youre looking for fairness youre looking for equity 
i wrote down a bunch of words to help me make the determination 
and i wish i had them because theyre all along that those lines 
experience and i did say that id like somebody that will 
interpret the constitution not legislate 
q but can you even be sure of that sir does that mean that 
youve at least studied some of his rulings 
bush there has been a great deal of work done in the justice 
department at several levels in our general counsels shop on all 
that kind of thing but again it would be inappropriate to go into 
those cases that he may have ruled on when he was on the state 
court or on the federal bench and i would simply leave that to the 
senate but yes there has been a thorough study of judge souters 
tremendously impressive record 
q mr president given the reality of getting a person 
confirmed to the supreme court these days are you braced for a big 
battle 
bush well i dont im not going into this nomination or 
thrusting judge souter into the nomination expecting a highly 
contentious battle the man was confirmed by the senate 
unanimously and after testimony so im not suggesting theres 
going to have to be or should be i remember calmer days when there 
werent so i would not anticipate a contentious battle i would 
anticipate thorough questioning i would anticipate each senator 
having enough information to make up his or her mind based on the 
record or responses to questions but no im not were not 
bracing for some horrendous fight with the united states senate 
and given his record i would expect that the chances of that are 
minimal

amnesty international on monday welcomed an 
announcement by cameroon president paul biya that all political 
prisoners in his central african country would be released soon 
but the human rights group noted cameroon continues to imprison 
people for their political beliefs 
no exact date was announced for the release 
in a statement amnesty noted biyas government frequently holds 
people in administrative detention without charge or trial tries 
them unfairly before military tribunals or keeps them in jail after 
they have been acquitted or completed their prison terms 
abdoulaye mazou for example was convicted in 1984 to a 
fiveyear term for his involvement in an unsuccessful coup attempt 
the londonbased group said 
the former lawyer and magistrate was considered a prisoner of 
conscience when he was held in administrative detention for a year 
after he had completed his sentence even after his release in 
april mazou has been confined to his home amnesty said 
the nobel peace prizewinning group noted many of the more than 
100 political prisoners held since 1984 in connection with the 
attempted coup remain in detention despite the presidents promise 
in april that they would be released 
among those held are former transport company official paul 
daissala dakole and habouba mousse an airline employee 
former president ahmadou ahidjo turned over power to biya in 
1982 after 22 years in power though the transfer came about 
peacefully the two men later had a fallingout 
on april 6 1984 a faction of the elite republican guard loyal 
to ahidjo tried to topple biya fighting raged around yaounde for 
two days before the rebels were suppressed by loyal troops 
official estimates say 70 died but observers said as many as 
1000 were killed at least 46 of the arrested plotters were later 
executed 
ahidjo who was in retirement in france was tried in absentia 
and condemned to death biya later lifted the sentence 
amnesty noted that despite biyas statements on the release of 
political prisoners two men recently were jailed after trying to 
set up a political party in the oneparty state 
former bar association president yondo mandengue black and 
anicet ekane a company director were sentenced to 3 and 4year 
prison terms in april by a special military court the rights group 
said 
the two were imprisoned for attending meetings to discuss 
multiparty democracy and setting up a new political party 
amnesty on monday called for the release of the men they said 
were prisoners of conscience 
two others nicole ngakou and her brother george yopa were 
acquitted on charges of distributing subversive material in 1987 
but continue to be held in administrative detention without charge 
or trial 
the amnesty statement also cited the case of djeukam tchameni 
dominique who was sentenced by a military court earlier this year 
to three years in prison for bringing into the country an 
audiocassette containing criticism of the government 
amnesty said it welcomed biyas statement that he was ready to 
allow the group to visit cameroon and meet with government 
officials

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee said monday hell join an effort to kill the b2 bomber 
dealing a serious blow to president bushs effort to build the 
stealth aircraft 
if the threats we face internationally were greater and the 
deficits we face at home were smaller we might continue to hedge 
on the b2 but they arent and we cant rep les aspin dwis 
told reporters prior to his planned speech on the house floor 
announcing his decision 
aspins announcement comes on the eve of his committees 
crafting later this week of a 283 billion defense bill for the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 and is certain to give impetus to 
house efforts to cancel the b2 program 
legislation sponsored by three members of the armed services 
panel reps ron dellums dcalif john rowland rconn and 
john kasich rohio would terminate the program at the 15 planes 
in development 
proponents said they have the 218 votes necessary in the house 
to kill the b2 and dellums predicted that with aspins support 
the campaign to terminate the program will prevail in the senate as 
well 
the more american people see and learn about this weapon 
system the less support there is dellums said at a news 
conference so im going to stick my neck out and say this is the 
year that we stop the b2 bomber 
kasich heralded victory in the house but declined to forecast 
success when lawmakers craft a final defense bill 
this seals the fate for the b2 certainly for the house 
said rep jim slattery dkan who has lobbied against the bomber 
program in which the government has invested more than 26 
billion and has kept a tally on the number of opponents 
in his speech a copy of which was made available to reporters 
aspin vowed to work with the b2 opponents and congratulated them 
on their impending success 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said aspins 
announcement will be a very influential statement and it will 
have a major impact in congress with respect to the b2 
the air force chief of staff gen michael j dugan told 
reporters at the pentagon that aspins voice carries some extra 
weight and wed hoped that we wouldnt have to fight that extra 
weight 
dugan vowed that the service would step up its lobbying in the 
house for the batwinged aircraft and said that killing the program 
would send a message to friend and foe alike that the united 
states has lost its stomach for defense 
it is in my view criminal to shut it off at this point 
dugan said 
although the house may kill the program support for the bomber 
in the senate remains with the armed services powerful chairman 
sen sam nunn dga backing the aircraft 
but even nunn who reiterated his support for the bomber said 
the b2 faces problems in congress and aspins decision makes the 
fight to preserve the aircraft an uphill battle 
i do not believe that the b2 program can be preserved unless 
the president the secretary of defense the joints chiefs of staff 
and our arms control negotiators all argue forcefully for the 
program nunn said in a statement 
without this support the senate armed services committee 
position is unlikely to prevail 
in approving its 289 billion defense bill the senate armed 
services committee agreed to bushs request for two planes in 
fiscal 1991 the full senate is expected to consider the 
legislation later this month 
a proponent of the b2 rep ike skelton dmo said a final 
decision on the bomber probably wont be made until the house and 
senate meet later this year to iron out the differences in their 
two bills 
but skelton whose district includes whiteman air force base 
where a b2 unit will be based urged that in the meantime the 
bush administration argue a better case for the bomber 
im terribly disappointed by the lack of support by the 
administration said skelton who contended that former president 
reagan would have members of congress to the white house to lobby 
for the bomber 
i understand they will be inviting people down to the white 
house soon he said it may be a day late and a dollar short 
aspin who last year opposed a bill to kill the b2 said he 
based his latest decision on the cost of the bomber its 
capabilities and its mission in the final analysis aspin said he 
found no unique and compelling mission for the b2 
it has not been demonstrated that we must build the b2 now 
he said if we press ahead we will spend additional tens of 
billions of dollars before we know if the b2 will work and before 
we know if it is really necessary and thats assuming that there 
would be room in the budget in the first place which will be 
extremely hard to find 
in his 307 billion military budget for fiscal 1991 bush 
proposed spending 55 billion for five of the radarevading 
aircraft and related items 
but in april defense secretary dick cheney cited the lessening 
soviet threat and fiscal constraints as he presented his revised 
plan for the program two bombers in fiscal 1991 at a cost of 46 
billion and 75 planes total with a price tag of 63 billion 
the pentagon originally envisioned building 132 planes 
despite cheneys revision support for the bomber continued to 
erode in congress where lawmakers expressed dismay over the cost 
of a single plane which under the scaled back plan rose to 815 
million 
since cheneys announcement the congressional budget office has 
estimated that the bomber which is manufactured by northrop corp 
will likely cost 865 million apiece and the total program might 
rise to 65 billion

q do you think a president these days has to do more of a 
selling job than in the past 
bush i dont know maureen i dont think so if the record 
speaks for itself if id have selected somebody out of the 
political arena that had never been on the bench and never had any 
experience but was in my view well qualified there might well have 
been more intervention on my part im prepared to do whatever is 
appropriate in not only defending but advocating this confirmation 
but i dont believe theres going to be a lot of personal 
involvement necessary because i think his record and his standing 
will speak for itself 
yes 
q mr president ive got to make one more try you say its 
inappropriate to ask but you also admit there is a lot of 
background paperwork on someone judge souter was appointed to the 
new hampshire court by governor sununu whose feelings on abortion 
are well known your feelings on abortion are well known why 
should we not believe that that is a factor in your selection 
bush because ive told you its not and because you ought to 
listen to the testimony in the hill and then you can make up your 
mind better when youve seen the evidence and that i expect 
people will be raising this question ive seen a lot of 
speculation on it over the last 48 hours or whatever it was since 
justice brennan retired but im telling you you asked me what my 
view was and ive told you how i approach this matter and thats 
all i can do 
yes 
q mr president you said a moment ago that there are senate 
precedents on how questioning happens in the judiciary committee 
in fact there are two very contrasting precedents there was the 
bork precedent where the nominee answered all sorts of questions 
and there was the justice oconnorjustice kennedy precedent in 
which the nominee declined to answer a lot of specific questions 
about how the nominee felt do you have any preference about how 
your nominee handles these questions 
bush no but i have confidence my nominee will handle it 
properly and hes look the man is a judge on an appeals court 
he knows how to treat with this and the senate is a free senate 
and they know how to treat with it so that im not going to get 
into that i think its inappropriate for a president to do that 
kind of thing 
q do you think its appropriate for a nominee to answer 
specific questions about how he might rule on 
bush i would leave that to the nominee and let the senate make 
the final determination 
yes 
q were there one or two aspects of the judges background that 
qualifications that particularly brought him to the top of the 
list 
bush being bright extraordinarily bright and then a record for 
fairness extraordinarily fair well ive made my judgment based 
youve asked me what i decided it on and these are some of the 
qualifications that i think are essential plus i gave you the 
underpinning which i want somebody that is not going to be a 
legislator sitting on the supreme court 
yeah and then ann 
q did you meet judge souter before you made this decision other 
than the last couple of days 
bush yes just within the last couple of days 
q the first time youve ever seen him 
bush first time id met him and who knows the amount of time 
i spent in new hampshire i might well have seen him but i 
laughter weve been as i have indicated been talking to our 
attorney general and boyden gray on resumes or on records for a 
long long time and the man is very highly regarded so but i 
no i just had a short visit with judge souter today and 
obviously was quite impressed 
yes ann 
q you had already decided at that point sir 
bush no i had not decided and thats the truth as is 
everything else i said here laughter yeah go ahead 
q in in speaking to your advisors about resumes and records 
as you say did you ask your advisors to produce only nominees who 
had no extensive written record on the abortion issue 
bush no 
q that inaudible more candidates who would not provoke 
a large debate over 
bush no 
yeah owen 
q i wonder if you can you tell me how is it possible to make 
the selection without reviewing the judges record or a summary of 
his record that dealt with specific cases if not abortion 
affirmative action civil rights issues free speech a lot of the 
emotional issues that the country is very concerned about 
bush most of his writings have been at the state level and the 
the i made the decision based on the criteria that i gave you 
q so youre telling us that you have no idea what his judicial 
opinions are on abortion affirmative action and civil rights flag 
burning 
bush im telling you that you should stay tuned and let the 
testimony before the united states senate determine whether hes 
confirmed or not and that that will bring out all the questions 
that youre asking here and the answers thats up to the judge to 
see how he should handle that as one who is going to have to deal 
with a lot of issues in the future 
yeah 
q mr president has governor sununu who is well acquainted 
with the nominee given you his reading on the judges views on 
controversial issues 
bush no theres no no 
way in the back 
q inaudible 
q am i back far enough

the juggernaut of german unity suddenly has 
been stopped by what would appear to be a petty political clash 
but which in fact could determine who runs the unified nation 
politicians in both germanys were pointing fingers monday while 
many germans were shaking their heads over the seemingly trivial 
issue of whether unification should take place dec 1 or dec 2 
german newspapers have derided the partisan slugfest as 
sleazy and pointless especially because east germans are 
struggling with mounting joblessness and soaring prices 
in the past week the issue has threatened to collapse the 
fragile coalition government of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
and laid bare intense behindthescenes political maneuvering 
on monday night the infighting intensified when east germanys 
social democrats and the centrist liberals refused to take part in 
a meeting of coalition leaders 
the two parties cited as their reason for not attending the 
meeting de maizieres insistence that unification cannot come 
before elections in both germanys 
leaders of the two parties called separate meetings for tuesday 
morning saying they would recommend to their membership pulling 
out of de maizieres coalition government unless he compromises on 
the issue 
the date of unification is considered important because it could 
help determine who will control the new german government and 
which parties will not even have a voice 
it would be decisive for the composition of the parliament and 
the government said klaus becher a political analyst for the 
german society for foreign politics in bonn west germany 
east germanys leftleaning social democrats the nations 
secondlargest party and a liberal alliance have demanded that 
unity occur a day before german elections tentatively set for dec 
2 
they are demanding all of germany act as a single electorate 
that chooses a united parliament 
de maiziere and several smaller parties ranging from the 
former communists to the activists who overthrew them want the 
two nations to formally unify immediately after elections are held 
under this proposal simultaneous elections would be held in 
each nation the votes would be counted separately and political 
representation would be based on how each party did in its own 
country 
east germanys parliament already has passed a law requiring 
that a party receive 5 percent of the vote in order to be 
represented in parliament the same rule as in west germany 
under de maizieres proposal smaller parties in east germany 
including the communists would stand a better chance of winding 
up in the united parliament 
that would help the christian democratic parties of de maiziere 
and especially his mentor west german chancellor helmut kohl who 
wants to lead a united germany 
the conservative christian democrats rely more on coalitions 
with conservative and centrist parties for parliamentary majorities 
the social democrats meanwhile would be hurt by separate 
elections because a proliferation of small leftist parties could 
split the leftleaning representation in parliament 
the social democrats in west germany are the main opposition 
party but in east germany they are a member of de maizieres 
broad sevenparty coalition government 
the east german social democrats and the liberal alliance have 
threatened to bolt the coalition and perhaps collapse the 
government unless single elections are held 
east germanys parliament met until midnight sunday trying to 
break the impasse then finally agreed to throw the issue to 
committees of both german parliaments 
on monday all the parties traded more charges de maizieres 
chief spokesman matthias gehler said the prime minister planned 
to meet with kohl this week in austria where kohl is vacationing 
to discuss the crisis 
but time is a factor both parliaments have left for their 
summer breaks and are not to return until the end of august they 
must enact election laws by sept 3 
it has become increasingly unlikely there will be allgerman 
elections on the 2nd of december becher said 
virtually everyone involved in the debate has taken a drubbing 
in the press 
this questionable sleazy debate over trivialities throws a 
stumbling block in the path toward german unification the 
cologne rundschau of cologne west germany said monday 
the hagen west germany newspaper westfalenpost said the 
wrangling over the coalition in east berlin represents politics at 
its worst 
the issue threatens not only the east german governing 
coalition but kohls governing partnership which is becoming 
increasingly divided on the matter

illegal anselmo pleaded innocent to a charge of thirddegree 
criminal mischief 
im getting letter after letter saying he should be knighted 
instead of cited sandy said last week they love him 
after his arrest the 64yearold president of pan american 
satellite corp said that real estate signs were turning all 
these streets into a used car lot 
he said he spraypainted the sign because it had been illegally 
placed on town property and admitted he had painted others 
the town should recognize your efforts to beautify and improve 
the quality of life instead of charging you of all people with 
mischief said one resident who wrote to sandy 
said another bully for you i have wanted to do that for 
years 
real estate agents who are trying to sell houses in a slow 
market are unhappy 
stanley klein president of empire realty corp called

i was almost tempted to spraypaint mr anselmos gate 
klein said 
anselmo a resident for 23 years donated 40000 to the town 
last year to plant trees and pays annually for the planting of 
flowers on town property 
he faces a maximum penalty of a 1000 fine and six months in 
prison if convicted he is due back in superior court in stamford

bush one two three and then im leaving 
q i wonder if you could tell me sir you extolled the judges 
virtues and pointed out more than once that he was unanimously 
confirmed by the senate for his present position can you think of 
any reason any possibility the senate would not confirm the judge 
for this post 
bush no 
q other than ideological grounds 
bush i can think of none why they would not confirm him none 
period 
q and would you object strenuously to a confirmation battle 
over ideological grounds 
bush look ive nothing to say about that this is a separate 
body i dont control the senate i would hope they would accept 
the when theyve had a chance to ask questions and theyve had a 
chance to review his record would conclude as i have that he is 
outstandingly wellqualified for the federal bench a judgment that 
was given to him not too long ago by the aba itself 
wellqualified which i gather is the highest rating a judge can 
have 
q you had said youre not interested in making a bush imprint 
on the court you may also be 
bush i have to i guess but im not interested in having this 
known as a bush court or something of that nature 
q well you may be called upon throughout your term to actually 
name one or two others do you have those in mind and also if 
bush yes 
q by having those names in mind of who you would appoint are 
you doing the same thing like in foreign policy saying that you 
want to choose a prudent man or that the imprint would be something 
peculiar to you in other words a 
bush look ill tell you how i look at this not in terms of 
some specific imprint but i want it said when im about lets 
see 66 about 90 24 years from now that i made a superb choice 
and i think it will be so writ 
q mr president id like to ask you about the phrase youre 
using on youre opposed to somebody who would legislate from the 
bench youre on record as wanting roe vs wade overturned youre 
on record as favoring a flagburning amendment to the constitution 
arent those sorts of issues tantamount to legislating from the 
bench as well 
bush well what youd have to tell me the case and advise me 
as to how i dont think so i dont think when called upon to 
answer a constitutional question that that has to be legislating 
from the bench 
q but you would not be upset if the court overturned roe vs 
wade 
bush no 
q or if the court upheld the flagburning amendment 
bush no and a lot of other things too i believe in the 
separation of powers i happen to think that theres been a many 
many things have troubled me encroachment of micromanagement by 
the united states congress on the presidency but i havent asked 
this able judge about those things but i could cite you cite 
two you cite one thats been on everybodys lips ever since i 
since justice brennan retired listen i never heard such coverage 
on the television you might just think the whole nomination had 
something to do with abortion and its far broader than that i 
have too much respect for the supreme court than to look at one 
specific issue and one alone ive got time for one yeah kathy 
q mr president theres been some speculation you might name 
an hispanic this time and make history in doing so you went a 
different route what do you say to those who might be disappointed 
that didnt happen and what is the likelihood you might name an 
hispanic should another vacancy develop 
bush first i say to whoever it is that inquires ive made the 
best choice i possibly could make in terms of qualifications 
ability background and temperament to serve on this court and 
then i say look the great thing about this country is you can 
achieve anything and theres a lot of time down the road in which 
im sure youll see a different makeup on the court but i dont 
im not going to deal in any one specific group visavis another 
one and thats what i would say but i just would ask the american 
people to understand i looked at a wide array of names prior to my 
getting into it in as much depth as i have very recently the 
attorney general his staff boyden gray and his staff went 
through this process its a continuance its a process thats 
been going on for some time and this the excellence was just 
there at the top and so i would not cite this as something 
discouraging for anybody that aspires to the supreme court or any 
group that would aspire to have representation on the supreme 
court listen i really do have to go 
q what did you ask him when you interviewed him 
q did you interview the other finalists mr president did he 
win in the interview 
bush he did very very well 
q two or three 
bush yeah let me get one ive been i failed to 
q two or three of the candidates that were mentioned were from 
your home state and there was talk that you perhaps would choose 
somebody from the south because you felt the south was in 
underrepresentation since justice powell resigned wasnt anybody 
qualified in the south or why did you 
bush no theres plenty of people qualified and you raise a 
good point because there arent there is nobody from the what i 
would call the southeast conference south but the south excluding 
texas that that is on the bench now and theres about a quarter 
of the people from there so this is a consideration and was a 
consideration it was forcefully brought home to me by key members 
of congress and yet i determined that judge souter given the 
qualifications ive tried to extoll here the virtues is the 
choice for the federal for the supreme court at this time 
but no these calls are not easy and kathy asked about 
different ethnic groups you asked about regional distribution and 
i think one considers all these all these criteria i think its 
fair to say that new england which is not represented on the bench 
now that justice brennan is retired might look at it if i had 
gone with another nominee as why were they excluded so i can 
understand regionalism but please believe me as a proud texan i 
tried to look at it on a in a national sense and i think ive 
come up with the best nominee jesse im sorry to disappoint you 
q a very quick followup if i could senator simpson suggested 
that you follow the counsel of mrs bush did you in any way on 
this particular issue 
bush how did he know he doesnt even know who i nominated how 
could he have said that 
q he said that he hoped that that would be what you would do 
bush oh i see wonderful fellow al

a makeshift inmate made up of a metal 
colander to represent a human head a vat of saline solution for 
the body and a piece of pipe as a leg was jolted with current in 
floridas electric chair monday 
the experiment was a stateordered test to show the chair works 
correctly and the botched execution of jesse tafero was probably 
caused by a synthetic sponge 
the electric chair works as it is supposed to said mike 
morse an associate professor of electrical engineering at auburn 
university and the electrical engineer who conducted the test 
the test was carried out in the death chamber at florida state 
prison in front of journalists state officials representatives of 
the general electric co and officials with corrections departments 
from virginia and south carolina 
but lawyers who represent deathrow inmates in florida said they 
were unimpressed and would continue appeals based on arguments that 
the chair will torture the next inmate strapped into it 
with the contraption sitting in the wooden electric chair morse 
conducted the 15minute demonstration which caused a noisy 
buzzing to check whether the chair was functioning properly 
the test was ordered by gov bob martinez after the botched may 
4 electrocution of tafero who died amid smoke and flames 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals has blocked several 
recent executions because of questions raised by defense attorneys 
about the chairs effectiveness 
the governor said he is satisfied that this objective test by 
independent experts conclusively shows what we have been saying all 
along that floridas electric chair is in working order 
it is my sincere hope that defense attorneys will cease using 
this false argument as a basis for unsubstantiated appeals he 
said 
during mondays test the current was turned on and meters 
attached to the device showed that the chair was putting out 2000 
volts and 10 to 11 amps 
it was a pictureperfect demonstration morse said 
defense attorneys contend the amount of electricty reaching 
tafero wasnt enough to kill him instantly 
the engineer said he had conducted similar tests over the 
weekend using the same kind of synthetic sponge used for the first 
time in the tafero execution and had seen results similar to that 
controversial death 
he said the sponge caused electrical arcing flames and 
sparks 
but morse believes the jolt received by tafero was still lethal 
it is very unlikely after the initial shock that he felt any 
pain morse said it would be highly unlikely that the brain 
would be functioning 
state rep ron silver a north miami democrat who is chairman of 
the house committee on criminal justice attended the test and said 
he hoped it would satisfy the circuit court 
martinez who had earlier blamed the fire on the 
neverbeforeused synthetic sponge that wont be used again said 
he ordered the tests to show the appeals judges that the chair is 
functioning 
defense attorneys for other death row inmates have successfully 
delayed several recent scheduled executions by arguing that tafero 
was burned alive by low voltage and that present clients might 
suffer the same fate a violation of the us constitutions 
prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment 
i hope this demonstration and test will be satisfactory and 
if it is not we need to proceed from there to do what is necessary 
to carry out the laws of the state silver said

senators who will decide whether to confirm 
judge david souters for the supreme court said monday they want to 
learn more about his littleknown track record before deciding 
whether to support him 
the chief question from many democratic lawmakers and 
particularly interest groups in the debate over abortion was 
souters views on abortion in general and on the landmark roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion in particular 
prochoice groups concerned the sudden supreme court vacancy 
could lead to the reversal of roe vs wade demanded that the 
senate judiciary committee question souter extensively about his 
views on the issue 
a leading antiabortion group meanwhile said it did not 
believe souter had ever expressed an opinion on abortion but the 
group the national right to life committee said it was pleased 
that president bush said he chose souter because of his philosophy 
of not trying to legislate from the bench 
since roe vs wade has no basis in the constitution the 
appointment of such justices should continue the erosion of the 
tragic error of roe vs wde the right to life committee said in 
a statement 
the reaction from key senators was far more restrained for the 
most part because souter on the federal bench for less than a 
year is little known 
there will be a lot more known about him i guarantee you 
that said sen patrick leahy dvt a judiciary committee 
member 
sen edward kennedy dmass a leading judiciary committee 
member and early opponent of president reagans failed nomination 
of robert bork to the court said he would await hearing from 
souter before making up his mind 
without mentioning the word abortion kennedy made it clear he 
viewed the issue as central to the judiciary committees 
deliberations 
the judiciary committee and the full senate have a 
responsibility to determine whether he possesses a strong 
commitment to the fundamental values of the constitution and the 
bill of rights that are obviously at stake in this important 
nomination and that will profoundly affect the lives and rights of 
all americans kennedy said 
more praise came from sen slade gorton rwash a former 
attorney general of his stater who served as president of the 
national association of attorneys general while souter was attorney 
general for new hampshire 
he was an outstanding attorney general so my initial reaction 
is positive said gorton who is not a judiciary committee member 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine praised 
souters experience as a judge and as new hampshire state attorney 
general but did not express an opinion on the nomination mitchell 
promised democrats would conduct prompt and fair hearings 
sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking republican on the 
judiciary committee said he expected few if any fireworks over 
souters record because he just went on the court in april and i 
dont think hes had a controversial matter since then 
but another democratic panel member sen howard metzenbaum of 
ohio said the swift approval of souter to the 1st circuit court of 
appeals in boston should not be considered a bellweather 
there is a difference between being confirmed for the appeals 
court and for the supreme court metzenbaum said 
sen orrin hatch rutah the panels no 2 republican said he 
wanted to get to know him get to know his record so ill make a 
considered decision and im sure hell be fine 
some committee members said they would hold to the tradition of 
refraining from questions on how nominees would decide specific 
issues before the court 
still leahy said questions likely would be phrased to include 
abortion rights as a topic 
i think it would be naive to think that roe vs wade in one 
form or another is not going to be part of a lot of questions 
interestingly enough with the desire to know about that coming 
from both sides of the issue 
thurmond said he would have preferred a candidate from the 
south but added im going to support this nomination 
new hampshire gop sen warren rudman a souter friend for years 
said senators will find the 50yearold nominee to be a classic 
conservative intellectual he cannot be characterized as an 
ideologue in any way shape or form 
the prochoice groups promised to be heard and called for 
detailed questioning on roe vs wade 
the american people need to know where judge souter stands on 
the issues of individual and human rights said judith lichtman 
president of the national womens legal defense fund 
it would be a terrible injustice to confirm a nominee without 
knowing that he is commited to protecting americans fundamental 
constitutional rights including privacy and the right to choose 
said kate michelman head of the national abortion rights action 
league 
outside of washington alan dershowitz a liberal attorney and 
professor at harvard law school from which souter graduated 
called the nomination a sununu special 
john sununu bushs white house chief of staff was the 
republican new hampshire governor who elevated souter to the state

as a student at harvard law school 25 years 
ago david h souter was a resident adviser in a freshman dorm at 
harvard college where his charges included one charles g 
untermeyer 
untermeyer is now the white house personnel director souter on 
monday became president bushs nominee to the supreme court 
untermeyer was not involved directly in the selection process 
that fell to white house counsel c boyden gray atorney general 
dick thornburgh and others 
but untermeyer said monday he remembers souters scholarly mien 
as a freshman dorm chief souter had returned to harvard for law 
school after two years at oxford as a rhodes scholar 
he strikes me as sort of the pluperfect scholar said 
untermeyer 
souter could give the impression with the movement of an eye 
and the slightest inclination of his head that he was catching 
everything that goes on which is exactly the type of person you 
want watching over a freshman dorm said untermeyer

quebec offered monday to resume talks with 
oka mohawks regarding a violent dispute over a golf course addition 
planned on land claimed as ancestral territory the provincial 
government also agreed that observers from human rights 
organizations could attend 
john ciaccia quebecs native affairs minister said the 
province wants the talks held away from the barricades where 
indians and police have faced each other for nearly two weeks a 
shootout july 11 resulted in the death of a quebec police officer 
the red cross one of the few groups allowed beyond the 
barricades by police would be permitted to continue providing food 
and supplies according to a quebec statement that meets another 
mohawk demand for free movement of food and medicine 
ciaccias proposals were seen by some mohawks as a step in the 
right direction said peter diome spokesman for the mohawk 
nation office in kahnawake at least they are now making an 
effort to reopen the lines of communication that they previously 
closed 
but diome said progress will be limited until the federal 
government gets involved 
were still talking about nationtonation and where is the 
federal government he asked 
ciaccia said in an interview he wants talks held outside the 
barricades not for security reasons but to create an atmosphere 
of calm we must accept that the only way to resolve this is 
through peaceful negotiations there is no question of armed 
violence 
in ottawa a senior indian affairs official told reporters 
monday a gang of criminals have taken over negotiations in oka 
18 miles west of montreal 
the federal official who spoke at an offtherecord briefing 
said a radical element in the mohawk community has hijacked the 
land claims negotiations and is holding the mohawk community in a 
state of armed insurrection 
he was talking about reports that the militant warrior society 
is controlling events at oka 
mohawks from nearby kahnawake reserve have blockaded the mercier 
bridge into montreal in support of the oka mohawks some commuters 
have to spend an extra two hours in travel daily and an 
antiindian backlash has developed 
ciaccia wants only mohawk representatives from kahnawake and 
kahnesetake involved in new negotiations kahnesatake is the mohawk 
settlement at oka 
this would exclude militant warriors from the akwesasne reserve 
near cornwall ontario who moved into oka to join the others 
indians in canadas westernmost british columbia province also 
erected barricades in sympathy and to press their own claims 
quebec police tried to storm a barricade mohawks erected in oka 
to stop the expansion of a local golf course onto what mohawks say 
is sacred land responsibility for the death of the policeman 
killed in the resulting gunfire has not been fixed 
ciaccia and the mohawks had been going into the woods behind 
mohawk barricades for talks until discussions broke down a week ago 
one request by the mohawks was that observers from the united 
nations or amnesty international monitor the talks 
ciaccia suggested monday that members of the quebec human rights 
commission or other quebec or canadian institutions agreeable to 
both sides be allowed to observe the talks

two of the 17 workers killed by an explosion 
at a texas chemical plant had told relatives they were worried 
about the plants safety the family members told a house panel 
monday 
the workers also had worries about training at atlantic 
richfield cos plant in channelview where vapors caught fire and 
exploded near an electric compressor july 5 
safety has to come before profit said sandy davis widow of 
greg davis a contract electrician killed in the blast ms davis 
wept while testifying that her husband told her several times he 
was unsure of the skills of some of his fellow contractors 
the chief of the occupational safety and health administration 
gerald scannell said the agency has proposed new safety rules for 
the chemical industry but the rules arent being put into place 
fast enough said two houston congressmen democrat mike andrews 
and republican jack fields 
waiting on studies is not necessary andrews said 
theres not a chance in hell id work for a chemical plant 
unless i had a 1yearold child and was out of work said rep 
christopher shays rconn referring to davis whose widow said he 
took the arco job in suburban houston after being unemployed for 
six months and becoming a new father 
but fields cautioned it is doubtful that the government or 
any particular company can ever completely guarantee that 
something isnt going to go wrong 
the congressmen said they were frustrated that 40 workers had 
been killed at chemical companies in the nine months since the 
house employment and housing subcommittee examined the october 
explosion that killed 23 at a phillips plastics plant in pasadena 
another houston suburb 
osha has since cited phillips for 575 willful and serious 
violations and fined the company 57 million phillips has 
appealed the agency is still investigating the channelview 
incident scannell said 
as in pasadena many of the victims at the channelview plant 
were contract laborers osha began a study of the use of contract 
laborers at chemical plants after the phillips incident the study 
being written at lamar universitys john gray institute is 
expected to be complete this fall 
eleven of the channelview victims including davis were 
employees of austin industries 
arco uses such workers for ongoing capital programs at all 
its plants said harold sorgenti president of arco chemical co he 
estimated arco saved 600000 to 750000 in salary and benefits 
annually by using the contract laborers at channelview 
the contract workers were not covered by arcos life or health 
insurance but the families of all 17 victims are receiving 
250000 with no strings attached sorgenti said 
davis got less training less pay and fewer benefits than arcos 
regular employees at channelview his widow said he did not have 
the right to turn down overtime work ms davis said 
if they refused this overtime they put a bad mark on your 
record said bernard blackstock father of john blackstock an 
arco employee killed in the incident 
john blackstock contributed to an anonymous letter sent recently 
to plant managers seeking changes in the operation his father 
said the workers did not want to sign their names because they 
were afraid theyd be fired he said

the workers who have not had a pay increase since 1986 also 
seek wage increases greater than the 2 percent yearly boost

borisav jovic the serb now leading 
yugoslavias collective presidency said on monday that individual 
states will be allowed to secede from the fragile yugoslav 
federation 
the federation of six member states may itself be radically 
reshaped 
four republics are in favor of federation two are for a 
confederation jovic said in a statement read to reporters after 
his meeting with slovenias president milan kucan in ljubljana the 
republics capital 
the local governments of croatia and slovenia insist that this 
balkan nation of 23 million residents should become a loose 
association of nearindependent states which would remain united 
only if joint interests warrant it 
communistruled serbia the largest republic has held until now 
that a confederate structure would be too unstable and advocated 
retaining the federal system installed in 1945 the three small 
remaining states bosnia and hercegovin macedonia and montenegro 
also prefer a federation 
jovic said that if states favoring a looser union could not 
reach agreement with the rest of the country they would be 
permitted to enter into a confederation with the other republics 
that would stay in the current federal structure 
a subvariant is that regions that so desire would also be 
allowed to secede from yugoslavia jovic said 
he said he and kucan had very detailed and very open talks on 
the future of yugoslavia and its future constitutional setup 
we agreed that everybody should refrain from making any 
unilateral changes until a joint decision on the future of this 
ethnically diverse nation is reached jovic said 
slovenias newly elected government has served notice the 
northern republic of 2 million people would declare itself 
independent if the other states do not accept its demands to turn 
yugoslavia into a grouping of sovereign republics 
croatias new centerright authorities also support 
transforming yugoslavia into a confederation but say they want to 
discuss the nations future makeup at a joint meeting of the 
legitimate representatives of all states 
the slovenian parliament last week publicly refused to consider 
a letter from the federal presidency because it was not written in 
the local language 
slovenia will seek sovereignty complete economic and cultural 
sovereignty in a yugoslav confederation kucan said in his 
statement 
yugoslavia was formed as a joint kingdom of serbs croats and 
slovenes after world war i occupied and dismembered by nazi 
germany in 1941 it reemerging as a communiststyle federation 
under josip tito after world war ii with macedonia montenegro and 
bosniahercegovina added to the three prewar states 
serbia only now is taking a tentative step toward a multiparty 
system 
slovenia and croatia held free elections this year in which 
centerright parties won the majority marking the first free 
balloting here in 50 years

president bush on monday said he would 
nominate david h souter a littleknown federal appeals court 
judge to the supreme court bush said he acted without questioning 
souter on abortion or other delicate judicial issues 
if confirmed by a majority of the senate souter a 50yearold 
bachelor from new hampshire would succeed william j brennan who 
retired last friday 
bushs quick decision took washington by surprise and shifted 
the nations attention to the senate judiciary committee which is 
certain to examine souters record and explore his views on 
abortion and other issues 
with souter standing at his side bush described souter as a 
remarkable judge of keen intellect and the highest ability he 
chose his nominee after meeting him for the first time earlier in 
the day 
the president said it would have been inappropriate to apply 
an abortion litmus test on his nominee he said the selection 
was not geared to any single issue but to his ability to interpret 
the law 
souter has been on the federal appeals court for such a short 
period of time that he has not yet penned an opinion 
gordon tiffany like souter a former new hampshire attorney 
general said it is hard to classify souters judicial philosophy 
whether its liberal or conservative its not the issue in 
his mind the issue in his mind is what was intended in the 
constitution tiffany said 
conservatives hoped bush would give them a nominee who would 
overthrow the 1973 roevswade decision that legalized abortion 
the nomination appeared to underscore the influence exercised by 
john sununu bushs chief of staff who as governor of new 
hampshire had put souter on that states supreme court in 1983 
like bush sununu is an outspoken opponent of abortion 
andrew card sununus deputy said sununu did not suggest souter 
to bush 
at a news conference a questioner noted that bush and sununu 
both have widely known views against abortion and asked why people 
shouldnt think that souters abortion view was known to bush even 
if bush did not question him about it 
i told you its not bush said 
the national right to life committee a leading antiabortion 
group said it did not believe souter had ever expressed an opinion 
on abortion but the committee said it was pleased that bush said 
he chose souter because of his philosophy of not trying to 
legislate from the bench 
bush noted that souter had won unanimous senate confirmation 
when he was nominated in january for the appeals court suggesting 
his hope that the nomination might not trigger a political 
freeforall in the senate 
were not bracing for some horrendous fight with the united 
states senate bush said 
but sen patrick j leahy dvt a liberal member of the senate 
judiciary committee said it would be naive to think that 
souter would not be quizzed about abortion 
there will be a lot more known about him i guarantee you 
that said leahy 
in fact prochoice groups demanded that committee sound souter 
out on his abortion views 
the american people need to know where judge souter stands on 
the issues of individual and human rights said judith lichtman 
president of the national womens legal defense fund 
senate majority leader george mitchell praised souters 
experience but did not express an opinion on the nomination 
mitchell promised democrats would conduct prompt and fair hearings 
sen strom thurmond rsc the ranking republican on the 
judiciary committee said he expected few if any fireworks over 
souters record because he just went on the court in april 
when bush nominated souter for the appeals court the american 
bar associations screening committee called him wellqualified 
its highest rating for judicial nominees 
bush said he decided on souter earlier in the day 
the excellence was just there bush said 
the president praised brennan as well calling the courts 
longtime leading liberal one of the greatest figures of his 
age 
the 84yearold brennan in frail health resigned friday 
appointed by president dwight d eisenhower he had served longer 
than most americans have been alive

an affiliate of the church of scientology on 
monday promised rewards of up to 10000 for internal revenue 
service employees who turn in corrupt irs officials 
representatives of the national coalition of whistleblowers 
carrying a 5foothigh wanted poster camped outside irs 
national headquarters and gave literature to irs employees at 
lunchtime 
we want to assist those honest irs employees who are aware of 
corruption and abuses to come forward said coalition spokesman 
mike lashaway 
irs employees he said often are reluctant to report wrongdoing 
despite laws to protect whistleblowers 
the church of scientology and its branches have been involved in 
several tax disputes with the irs 
the coalition created by scientologists to collect and 
publicize information on irs abuses promised a 5000 reward for 
information leading to conviction of an irs official for criminal 
misconduct another 3000 is added if the official is head of a 
national department or an irs district 
an additional 2000 will be tacked on if it can be proved that 
the irs internal inspection service was aware of the illegality and 
didnt take actions required to stop it 
the irs declined comment on the reward offer 
the supreme court ruled earlier this year that fixed donations 
to the church are not deductible by individual parishioners a 
district court in boston held more recently that the irs violated a 
law setting out procedures for auditing churches when it 
investigated the church of scientology 
we think the exemptorganizations branch of the irs has 
discriminated against the church and individual scientologists 
said church spokeswoman sylvia stanard

nearly half of all puerto ricans 
favor statehood over the caribbean islands current commonwealth 
status and only 8 percent want independence according to a poll 
published monday 
although support for statehood appears to be growing the poll 
found that it still falls short of the majority required by bills 
now before congress to change puerto ricos political relationship 
with the united states 
the survey of 1204 eligible voters indicated that if puerto 
rico held a plebiscite on its status now 483 percent would choose 
statehood 406 percent commonwealth status and 8 percent 
independence with the remainder undecided 
the poll was published monday by san juans el mundo newspaper 
a previous poll published by the newspaper el nuevo dia in 
february showed 43 percent favoring statehood 36 percent 
commonwealth status 5 percent independence with the remainder 
undecided or refusing to reveal their preference 
however the two polls were conducted by different 
organizations which did not necessarily use the same methods 
the senate and the house are considering separate bills 
authorizing a plebiscite on puerto ricos status in june 1991 
both bills would allow puerto ricans to choose whether they want 
the island to become the 51st us state keep the commonwealth 
relationship but with increased autonomy or break away to form an 
independent nation 
the senate version would put the results of the plebiscite into 
immediate effect the house version would require negotiations with 
congress over implementation of the islanders choice 
gov rafael hernandez colon leader of the procommonwealth 
popular democratic party proposed a status plebiscite in his 1989 
inaugural speech following his reelection to a second consecutive 
fouryear term 
under the 38year commonwealth arrangement puerto ricos 33 
million residents are us citizens but they pay no federal taxes 
and cannot vote for president 
statehood supporters contend that the commonwealth status is a 
form of colonialism that makes puerto ricans secondclass citizens 
commonwealth supporters say the current status allows puerto 
ricans to enjoy the benefits of citizenship without giving up their 
spanish cultural identity 
fear of economic collapse has stymied the independence movement 
the el mundo poll found that 435 percent of puerto ricans would 
migrate to the us mainland if the island became independent 
the poll was carried out for el mundo and the educational 
station wmtjtv by the us firm frank i luntz amp associates based 
in arlington va and had a margin of error of 28 percent 
findings were based on facetoface interviews with randomly 
selected eligible voters from june 23 to july 2

a disguised anonymous man described as a former 
ira member confessed in a british television documentary on monday 
to the birmingham pub bombings for which six other people are 
serving life sentences 
the two bombings on nov 21 1974 killed 21 people and injured 
162 in the deadliest attack ever mounted by the irish republican 
army in its campaign to end british rule in northern ireland 
there were only two of us the man said these six people 
are innocent ive never met these six guys before in my life 
he fashioned his own disguise for the granada tv interview 
conducted in ireland as part of the world in action series an 
actor voiced over his words because it is illegal in britain to 
broadcast interviews with ira members 
the man pointed out on detailed floor plans where the bombs were 
left in each pub information the documentary said had not been 
published before he could describe the pubs interiors in detail 
four of the birmingham six confessed to the bombings but 
the documentary said the confessions contained inaccuracies about 
where the bombs were placed and provided few details about the 
pubs interiors 
the six say they were beaten into confessing their cause has 
been taken up by amnesty international and the irish government 
press association britains domestic news agency quoted a 
world in action spokesman not identified in accordance with 
british practice as saying the anonymous mans identity was known 
by authorities for years 
a granada documentary shown in march identified four alleged 
bombers and said a fifth could not be identified for security 
reasons 
none were among the birmingham six 
the man in the latest documentary said he was told the targets 
were nearby government buildings i was assured that there would 
be plenty of warning given and that civilians werent the target 
he said 
the first bomb exploded within six minutes of an ira warning 
call to the police the documentary said 
there never will be there never can be any justification for 
taking the lives of innocent people its something i have to live 
with 
ive got to live with those nightmares the man said 
authorities are conducting an inquiry in the case ordered by 
home secretary david waddingtion 
britain in october freed the guildford four who were 
wrongly convicted 14 years earlier for an ira bombing after 
revelations that police made up confessions in the case

people including his wife and two of his daughters 
detailed questionnaires were distributed to about 100 potential 
jurors at the san mateo county courthouse the trial was moved to 
the county just south of san francisco because of extensive 
pretrial publicity in sonoma county north of the city 
defense attorneys asked the judge to consider moving the trial 
again because a defensecommissioned survey found that many san 
mateo county residents believe salcido is guilty despite 
objections from prosecutors the judge agreed to consider such a 
request however defense attorneys said they would not seek 
another change until after all prospective jurors were interviewed 
salcido 29 is accused of killing his wife two daughters his 
motherinlaw her two daughters and a coworker on april 14 1989

salcido who was dressed in a conservative gray suit his arms and 
legs free of shackles it was the first time salcido appeared in 
court without restraints and wearing something other than an orange 
jail jump suit

view of each jurors family background work experience intellect 
personality and beliefs questions included inquiries about 
hobbies whether potential jurors have consulted a psychiatrist and 
how they feel about viewing bloody photographs and videotapes 
the questionnaire also asked respondents their views on the 
death penalty 
judge reginald littrell said he had summoned 120 jurors for each 
of the four days the court will be in session this week

to five weeks 
i dont want any person on there with a bias against my 
client said sonoma county public defender marteen miller 
salcidos main attorney 
prosecutor peter bumerts said im just looking for ordinary 
people who have common sense and can bring their life experiences 
into the courtroom 
the defense survey found that nine of 10 san mateo county 
residents who know about the killings believe salcido is definitely 
or probably guilty 
everybodys heard about the case bumerts said theres no 
doubt about it 
miller said he doesnt plan to dispute the facts in the case 
salcido gave a full confession to police shortly after he was 
arrested in mexico his native country 
however miller said he plans to fight the death penalty by 
contending that salcido was drunk and on cocaine at the time of the 
slayings and was mentally unbalanced

organizations 25th anniversary 
j blanton belk founded the musical goodwill troupe in an effort 
to channel the idealism of the young and spread an upbeat message 
of universal brotherhood during a disruptive era of civil rights 
marches antiwar protests and political assassinations 
it was a very young world that wanted to have a say in what 
happened to them much more so than past generations recalled 
belk a former navy officer 
since then some 11000 up with people troubadours have 
performed in virtually every country

experience and there was no bigger challenge in the 60s than go 
give them a vehicle for their energy he said

a 9yearold boy was mauled 
by a mountain lion in glacier national park monday officials said 
the lion was tracked down and killed 
park information officer amy vanderbilt said scott ohare of 
dayton wyo was flown by helicopter to kalispell regional 
hospital where he underwent surgery monday afternoon for deep 
lacerations and puncture wounds to the head face neck and right 
arm 
hospital officials said ohare was in fair condition and added 
that the injuries were not lifethreatening 
vanderbilt said the attack occurred at the apgar picnic area 
near the west entrance to the park and across the road from one of 
the parks largest campgrounds 
ohare and two other children were playing on the beach of 
mcdonald lake about 1130 am when the lion apparently attacked 
without reason she said 
one of the other children ran to get ohares parents while the 
second child attempted to scare the cat off by throwing rocks 
vanderbilt said 
the mountain lion ran away when ohares parents richard and 
merry ohare arrived on the beach 
about 3 hours after the attack park rangers found and killed a 
45 to 50pound female yearling mountain lion less than 100 yards 
from where the attack took place vanderbilt said 
the carcass is being taken to montana state university where 
tests will be conducted to see if the animal might have had rabies 
rangers tracked the mountain lion using a dog and shot it with 
a highpowered rifle 
vanderbilt said officials have no idea why the mountain lion 
attacked all indications are that the children did not provoke the 
cat in any way she said 
vanderbilt added that mountain lion sightings in the apgar area 
are not unusual but no one has ever been attacked before 
confrontations however have been on the rise in western 
montana in the last several years a young child was killed near 
evaro by a mountain lion last fall and a game warden was forced to 
kill another as it charged him near bigfork two weeks ago a third 
mountain lion was trapped and removed from a heavily used nature 
area in missoula last week

the man president bush wants to become the 
supreme courts 105th justice is hardly known outside new 
hampshire but his state court work and those who know him 
suggest david souter is a closetothevest conservative judge 
he does not pay any attention to the emotional political 
aspects of cases before him said stanley m brown a manchester 
nh lawyer and a former american bar association officer he 
doesnt go out blazing new pathways thats not his forte 
gordon tiffany like souter a former new hampshire attorney 
general said it is hard to classify souters judicial philosophy 
whether its liberal or conservative its not the issue in 
his mind the issue in his mind is what was intended in the 
constitution tiffany said 
souter a state trial judge for five years before serving on the 
new hampshire supreme court until last april 30 appears to have 
had two political patrons warren rudman and john sununu 
rudman is a moderate republican senator from new hampshire who 
as state attorney general hired souter sununu a former governor 
who elevated souter to the state supreme court is the conservative 
white house chief of staff 
rudman once said souter who was considered a potential supreme 
court nominee by the reagan administration before anthony m 
kennedys appointment in 1988 possesses the most brilliant legal 
mind he had ever encountered 
souter has been serving as a judge on the bostonbased 1st us 
circuit court for less than three months 
in state cases 
he was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state supreme court 
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints 
the nations highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this 
year 
he was part of a 32 majority in a 1986 decision that allowed 
the main owner of the seabrook nuclear plant to sell bonds needed 
to complete the longentangled project his court rejected appeals 
from the state consumer advocate and several antiseabrook groups 
in one of the few civil rights cases in which souter 
participated he joined the state supreme courts ruling in 1987 
that said homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or 
foster parents but the state court said in that decision that 
homosexuals may not be barred from running daycare centers 
as a state judge in 1983 he held a 345 am hearing at the 
request of thengov sununu and ordered state employes staging a 
sickout over pay issues back to work under threat of 
5000aday fines against their union 
people for the american way a liberal group said its review of 
souters state supreme court record indicates he interprets 
constitutional guarantees narrowly especially in criminal cases 
the organization criticized him for an opinion that overturned a 
sexual assault conviction souter held that the defendant should 
have been allowed to present testimony that the victim behaved in a 
sexually provocative manner toward several men in a tavern the 
group said

david hackett souter nominated monday to 
the us supreme court is known in his adopted home state as a 
brilliant legal scholar a diligent judge a private man 
never married he lives alone on the family farm near weare 
nh where he moved from the boston suburb of melrose when he was 
11 hes now 50 
like president bush who appointed him souter is an 
episcopalian and a republican he never served in the military 
he belongs to the appalachian mountain club and is in excellent 
health he told the senate judiciary committee at the time he was 
nominated to the 1st circuit court of appeals this spring 
he had a net worth of 621252 at the end of 1989 including 
191000 in autos and other personal property 190000 in 
securities and 150000 in real estate according to financial 
records released monday by the committee he listed no liabilities 
bush said he wanted a justice who would rely on the constitution 
and not legislate from the bench and the president seemed to 
be getting what he wanted judging from the comments of lawyers who 
know souter as well as from the few personal remarks of souters 
that have made it into print 
one of souters mentors sen warren rudman rnh decribed 
him monday as a classic conservative with great reverence for the 
constitution and the law 
he has a small circle of very good friends and lives an almost 
monastic life rudman said if he has any fault i believe its 
that hes worked too hard all his life but thats the way he is 
stanley m brown a manchester trial attorney described souter 
as a cautious judge who ignores the political and emotional 
consequences of each case when reaching a decision 
if there is any weakness in the man it is that he does not 
pay any attention to the emotional political aspects brown 
said you are not supposed to and he doesnt he is not going 
to create a constitution 
and rep charles g douglas rnh who served with souter on 
the new hampshire supreme court from 1983 to 1985 said theres 
nobody with a keener mind a better ability to read and digest 
material and then write an opinion that will stick to the law 
interpret the law and not go rambling all over the countryside 
willynilly 
souter himself in an interview in 1976 let a little of his own 
feeling out in remarks linking language and the law 
he said the more we allow language to be debased the more 
freeswinging we are in our interpretation of legal language the 
more arbitrary and personal not grounded in the constitutional 
process 
as attorney general of new hampshire souter told senate 
judiciary committee at the time he was nominated to the 1st circuit 
court of appeals this year he took active opposition to attempts 
to legalize casino gambling in new hampshire and to the prosecution 
of those who refused to end their occupation of the site of the 
seabrook nuclear plant in 1977 
asked his view of judicial activism souter wrote the 
obligation of any judge is to decide the case before the court and 
the nature of the issue presented will largely determine the 
appropriate scope of the principle on which its decision should 
rest 
souter attended harvard college then oxford university where 
he was a rhodes scholar and harvard law school from which he was 
graduated in 1966 
if confirmed he would be would be the first new englander to 
serve on the supreme court since the retirement of justice felix 
frankfurter in 1962 he would be the courts second rhodes scholar 
joining justice byron r white 
after law school souter spent two years with a prestigious firm 
in concord then became an assistant state attorney general in 
1968 three years later he was appointed deputy attorney general 
and in 1976 attorney general 
gov meldrim thomson appointed him a superior court judge in 
1978 and thengov john sununu now white house chief of staff 
elevated him to the state supreme court in 1983 he was appointed 
to the 1st us circuit court of appeals in boston on april 30 and 
began that job just last month 
bostonarea lawyers praised souters intellect and willingness 
to study a case 
david berman an attorney from medford argued a case before 
souter in june that involved questions about whether the town of 
concord should pay for the education of a child suffering from 
multiple disorders 
the questions he asked were highly intelligent questions both 
of me and my adversaries i was very impressed by the time he had 
taken to study the case berman said 
on the judiciary committee questionnaire earlier this year 
souter was asked the 10 most significant cases he personally 
litigated as deputy attorney general he included his first case a 
simple automobile collision case 
it was not significant for any novelty except to me for it 
was the first case i was allowed to try solo in the superior 
court souter wrote i had reason despite my overpreparation 
to be grateful for the courts patience and with equal 
thankfulness i remember the opposing counsel and even the opposing 
party for providing that first chance for me to stand up in a 
courtroom all by myself

italian foreign minister gianni de michelis 
said monday that the european community would link economic 
cooperation with israel to the new israeli government making 
progress toward middle east peace 
de michelis president of the ecs council of ministers made 
the statement after the first meeting of the socalled troika of 
european foreign ministers with israels new foreign minister 
david levy of the rightwing likud bloc 
the meeting came as european leaders are putting increasing 
pressure on israel to move toward peace with palestinians and as 
israel is seeking wider trade cooperation from europe 
de michelis said the visiting europeans foreign ministers who 
included jacques f poos of luxembourg and gerard collins of 
ireland expressed to israeli leaders their concerns about the 
situation in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the italian official told a news conference that the ec was 
willing to support any initiative toward middle east peace even if 
it does not conform to one adopted by european leaders at a summit 
last month 
the summit in dublin recommended an international peace 
conference on the middle east including representatives from the 
palestine liberation organization israel views the plo as a 
terrorist organization and rejects the idea of an international 
conference 
were open to examine all possibilities offered by all 
parties of course also by the israeli government de michelis 
said after the meeting 
he said the ec would take into consideration israels views of 
the plo but that israel would have to find another real 
palestinian interlocutor 
he also said however that european leaders were worried that 
middle east tensions could deteriorate dangerously unless steps 
were taken quickly toward peace 
when asked whether israel would be granted crucial economic 
concessions as the 12nation ec moved toward a single market in 
1992 de michelis said that would depend on progress toward peace 
if the peace process continues there will be a jump in the 
quality of economic cooperation in the entire region and of course 
israel has a special place in that he said 
but he added if there is a deterioration economic and 
social cooperation will become more and more difficult 
de michelis said the ec leaders were concerned that a wave of 
soviet jews immigrating to israel could adversely effect the 17 
million palestinians in the occupied territories 
levy noted that europe does not face the dangers that israel 
does in dealing with the palestinians and its arab neighbors 
the visit by the three foreign ministers was the first by ec 
leaders to israel since prime minister yizthak shamir formed a 
rightwing government in june led by his likud bloc 
the three ministers are to meet tuesday with shamir before 
traveling to tunis for talks with the arab league

the jury in the second mcmartin pre school 
molestation trial announced it had reached a partial verdict 
monday but was ordered to resume deliberations on 6 counts on 
which it was deadlocked 
superior court judge stanley m weisberg allowed jurors to go 
home for the night before resuming consideration of charges that 
raymond buckey molested three girls at his familys nursery school 
in the early 1980s 
weisberg disclosed in a brief court session that jurors had 
asked for further legal instruction but didnt explain further 
it wasnt revealed what charges the jurors agreed on or whether 
they voted for conviction or acquittal 
jurors had said in a foremans note the panel had considered all 
eight charges twice before concluding that they were hung on 
six counts 
the judge urged them to deliberate further telling them each 
of you must decide the case for yourself and should do so after 
deliberating with the other jurors 
all eight felony charges are child molestation 
outside court buckey said he was nervous but optimistic 
of course im optimistic because i know the truth of my 
innocence he told reporters 
asked how he felt about the prospect of a third trial if the 
jury hopelessly deadlocks he said i think everyone is tired of 
the mcmartin case i think it should end 
the jurys announcement that verdicts had been reached came at 
the start of the panels third week of deliberations in a case that 
has stretched over six years with two trials and lengthy 
preliminary hearings 
buckey was acquitted along with his mother of a number of other 
charges in the first trial 
his second trial lasted three months far shorter than the 
first which was the nations longest criminal proceeding and cost 
los angeles county 135 million

cardinal joseph ratzinger the 
popes main guardian of orthodoxy attacked marxistinfluenced 
liberation theology during a visit here monday 
the west german cardinal chief of the vaticans sacred 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith came to rio to open a 
special weeklong course for brazilian clergymen organized by the 
local archdiocese 
the congregation does not condemn all liberation theology 
but believes it is necessary to exclude a specific type which is 
influenced by marxism he told a news conference 
liberation theology a grassroots doctrine which promotes 
social and political awareness among the poor has a strong 
following in brazil where the roman catholic clergy is considered 
among the worlds most liberal 
ratzinger said some liberal clergymen reduce faith to a 
predetermined sociopolitical position 
they use the church as a political party and produce a 
faith that is partial and does not respond to all of humanity 
he added 
ratzinger did not mention by name any clergymen he considered 
proponents of marxistinspired liberation theology 
the vatican has come into open conflict with the brazilian 
church on several occasions in recent years 
in 1988 bishop pedro casaldaliga known for his outspoken 
defense of landless peasants in his diocese in the central state of 
mato grosso had restrictions placed on his visits to central 
america 
three years earlier leonardo boff internationally recognized 
as a leading progressive theologian was sentenced to a years 
penitential silence for his criticism of church authority

state officials said monday they have 
distributed paychecks to more than half of the 18500 state 
employees whose salaries were overdue by up to 12 days because of a 
switch to a new computer system 
the states finance director alexander holmes said he hoped 
the problem of late payroll checks would be solved by july 31 when 
another 30000 state workers are due to be paid 
some unpaid workers said they had run out of money to buy food 
or pay rent and utility bills 
state payroll processors worked through the weekend often until 
midnight to clear the backlog of paychecks by monday the number 
of overdue paychecks had been reduced to 9600 holmes said more 
than 60000 people are employed by the state 
officials used a 166 million cashflow reserve fund to pay off 
workers and used an older computer system to cut down on 
processing difficulties caused by the recent switch to a new 13 
million computer system holmes said 
asked if the problems will be ironed out by july 31 holmes 
said i have confidence in the system and the people who are 
working to get it done 
he said the paycheck delays have been caused because the 
programming in the new computer system is not working as fast as 
expected and coded tapes coming in from various state agencies are 
not in the proper form 
officials said some child support payments were being delayed 
because of the computer problems a home for mentally retarded 
adults in ardmore said it may have to shut down if state checks for 
workers and clients are not received soon

parliament early tuesday ratified a new 
defense treaty with the united states that will allow two major 
us military bases to remain on the island of crete for at least 
eight more years 
the parliaments decision ends more than 18 months of 
uncertainty about the future of the us bases following the 
expiration of the previous usgreece defense treaty in december 
1988 
the treaty has been a divisive issue in greek politics with 
conservatives supporting a continued us military presence and 
leftists demanding the removal of the bases 
as lawmakers debated the treaty hundreds of antibase 
demonstrators clashed with police monday near the city of khania on 
crete three policemen were slightly injured after being shot by 
demonstrators the public order ministry said 
the defense agreement which was signed by representatives of 
the two countries earlier this month would take effect in 
september and run through 1998 
in greece the treaty will become law as soon as it is signed by 
president constantine caramanlis and published in the government 
gazette 
a state department official requesting anonymity said late 
monday that the united states considers the pact an executive 
agreement which would not require ratification by congress 
after an exchange of notes between the two countries the 
administration would only have to notify congress about it within 
60 days for it to take effect the official said 
the treaty continues a defense relationship between the two nato 
allies that began in 1953 the pact guarantees that the united 
states will defend greece from attack by a hostile country 
the us administration has also agreed to seek congressional 
approval for an aid package that would provide greece with about 
345 million in assistance to buy us military equipment supply 
surplus planes and destroyers worth about 1 billion and write off 
about 50 million in past debts for military purchases 
parliament approved the defense treaty by the narrowest of 
margins shortly after midnight monday following a threeday debate 
a simple majority of the 300member parliament was required for 
ratification 
all 151 deputies from the ruling conservative new democratic 
party voted in favor of the treaty it was opposed by 144 
communist socialist and environmentalist deputies four deputies 
were absent and one abstained 
the treaty allows the united states to continue operating two 
major military bases on crete a naval support facility at souda 
bay and iraklion air station near the village of gournes 
two bases near athens a navy communications station at nea 
makri and the hellenikon air base have been slated for closing by 
the defense department as a costcutting measure numerous relay 
stations throughout greece will also close 
on crete a coalition of leftist groups opposed to the us 
bases staged demonstrations in khania that lasted into the night 
as many as 2500 people took part in the protests according to 
witnesses and journalists at the scene 
police fired tear gas to prevent demonstrators from entering a 
municipal building to deliver a petition the public order ministry 
said 
clashes then broke out and three police officers suffered 
gunshot wounds the ministry said monday night another five 
officers were injured by gasoline bombs and stones hurled by 
demonstrators the ministry said 
a hospital source said 10 civilians were treated for respiratory 
problems caused by the tear bas and another 40 people received 
treatment for minor injuries 
a police official in khania said eight people were arrested 
during the disturbances 
demonstrators set three police vehicles and part of the 
municipal building on fire with gasoline bombs lighted fires in 
central khania and engaged in repeated skirmishes with police late 
into the night witnesses said police fired into the air they 
said 
the previous treaty expired in december 1988 but it was 
extended as negotiations continued through several changes of 
government in greece 
seventeen rounds of talks under the socialist government of 
premier andreas papandreou proved fruitless the talks were put on 
hold last year when coalition governments held power 
the conservative government elected april 8 and the united 
states reached agreement in principle on may 30 after two rounds of 
talks 
on monday papandreou called for a referendum on the defense 
agreement and warned it could hurt greeces relations with nearby 
countries 
crete is being turned into a fortress he said it 
provides the possibility of the united states undertaking air 
operations out of the nato area against countries of the middle 
east and north africa 
premier constantine mitsotakis denied the agreement harmed 
relations with other countries

an associated press story of july 19 on the 
disappearance of minority farmers did not make clear the 
relationship between the minority farmers rights act and the 1990 
farm bill 
the farm bill drafted by the house agriculture committee 
authorizes 20 million for education and technical assistance 
programs for minority farmers 
the 20 million authorization was included in the bill at the 
request of rep mike espy dmiss and was taken from the minority 
farmers rights act he introduced last month 
the authorization includes 15 million in education and 
technical assistance programs for minority farmers and 5 million 
for grants to historically black land grant colleges indian tribal 
community colleges hispanic institutions of higher education and 
alaska cooperative colleges 
espy said he hopes to get the remainder of his minority farmers 
rights act enacted into law next year 
sen wyche fowler jr dga who has introduced a similar 
minority farmers rights bill in the senate said last week he hopes 
to incorporate many of its provisions into the senate version of 
the 1990 farm bill 
the legislation would establish policies in the department of 
agriculture to end discrimination in the awarding of federal farm 
benefits create an affirmative action program within the 
department and establish an appeals process for discrimination

city health commissioner woodrow a myers fired 
a top aide and reassigned two others monday in a sweeping 
departmental shakeup prompted by the mishandling of pap smear test 
results 
calling it a betrayal of public trust myers told a news 
conference that an investigation found a combination of 
mismanagement and poor supervision led to critical delays in 
notifying women tested at cityrun clinics of findings that could 
indicate they had cervical cancer 
while no women apparently have died as a result of the 
mishandling myers indicated that some could be at risk 
in response to questions he said the health department already 
was facing at least one lawsuit but refused to discuss it further 
or to speculate on whether more legal actions may occur 
the scandal first brought to light in newspaper reports several 
months ago involved pap tests administered to some 3000 women at 
cityrun sexually transmitted disease clinics the tests were 
allowed to accumulate for a year without lab analysis or notice of 
the results to the patients 
when the tests were finally read 600 women were found to have 
abnormalities including 11 cases where cancerous cells were found 
and 93 where precancer conditions existed 
all but two of 104 women whose test results were most ominous 
have been located by the department myers said 
he conceded there was a very low prospect for finding the 
other two one of whom he said had used a false name while the 
other was wanted by the fbi in an unrelated matter 
myers named a sixmember panel in may to investigate the affair 
in announcing its findings on monday he said it was apparent 
that department policies since 1988 have resulted in an 
outrageous insensitivity to women who rely on this department 
the unconscionable delays were a betrayal of public trust 
this cannot continue 
myers said dr kenneth dressler former assistant commissioner 
in the departments bureau of laboratories had been fired while 
norman scherzer former assistant commissioner for epidemiology and 
prevention services and john miles former director of the 
sexually transmitted disease department were both being reassigned 
within the department 
myers said a fourth official dr stephen schultz former deputy 
commissioner for epidemiology and prevention services had been 
reassigned earlier from administrative to clinical duties 
in addition to those changes myers said he will appoint a new 
deputy commissioner for disease intervention to oversee the process 
and has agreed to have other health department programs reviewed by 
state agencies 
he said all of the tests that had gone unread have since been 
analyzed and department laboratories are now returning results 
within a week an outside lab is under contract to handle any 
overload to make sure that time frame is maintained he added

the navajo supreme court on monday 
denied suspended tribal chairman peter macdonalds request to 
remove the judge presiding over his electionfraud case 
the trial is scheduled to start tuesday before the tribes 
district judge robert yazzie in window rock but the tribes 
supreme court scheduled a hearing before the trials start to 
determine if macdonald will have adequate legal counsel 
macdonald who was put on paid leave by the tribal council 
faces 93 counts of election fraud in his 1986 reelection to the 
tribes chairmanship the charges allege macdonald filed a 
fraudulent campaign report when he failed to report contributions 
from nonindians and indians the charges also allege the funds 
received exceeded the maximum of 84192 allowed 
macdonald asked the supreme court on friday to remove yazzie on 
grounds of bias 
the prosecutors know they have a judge who is already on their 
side macdonald stated in a motion 
macdonald said yazzie is biased against him because macdonald 
attempted to remove the judge from the bench and claimed advisory 
counsel appointed by the judge is inadequate macdonald is acting 
as his own attorney but has lawyers for advisers 
i am not a lawyer and do not know how to conduct a trial the 
special prosecutors want to make sure i cannot get a lawyer 
appointed beyond the cardboardcutout lawyers that judge yazzie 
appointed in the last minute to make people think i am getting a 
fair shake macdonald said in the motion 
after the electionfraud trial macdonald still faces two 
separate trials on charges of bribes and kickbacks and on 
conspiracy charges in the tribes purchase of a large ranch 
a lawer previously retained by macdonald bowed out citing 
health problems and macdonald has said was having difficulty 
retaining replacement lawyers 
navajo legal aid attorney peter breen and farmington nm 
private attorney doug moeller were appointed by yazzie to advise 
macdonald 
breen said he planned to appear in court tuesday but moeller 
said he would stay away

the associated press is accelerating 
implementation of its photostream network and installation of ap 
leaf picture desks aiming to finish nationwide by the end of 1991 
a year earlier than previously announced 
president louis d boccardi said july 19 that the decision to 
step up the schedule came in response to encouragement from member 
newspapers to put the new photo system in place as soon as possible 
installations of photostream and ap leaf picture desks will 
start in september in new york the state in which ap will save the 
most money by switching from landline transmission to satellite 
delivery of pictures 
installations will start in october in other northeastern 
states in february installations will commence simultaneously in 
the three other divisions of the aps domestic photo service 
southeast central and west 
within each region ap teams will work in more than one state at 
a time but the general order for installations is determined by 
where the greatest savings can be made to help pay for the program 
the original timetable had called for a 28month installation 
program but development of hardware and software has proceeded 
at a pace that indicates we should attempt to accomplish this 
enormous task in 16 months boccardi said 
he said the ap would give its members at least a quarterly 
update on the progress of the installation program 
in addition to the landline savings the northeastern region is 
the first to begin conversion because of its proximity to aps 
photo and computer headquarters in new york aps technical center 
in new jersey and leaf systems inc in massachusetts which 
manufactures the ap leaf picture desk 
the new york region states in order of installations are new 
york pennsylvania massachusetts rhode island new jersey maine 
vermont new hampshire and connecticut 
installation in the other three regions will be in this general 
order 
central texas ohio indiana kentucky michigan iowa 
nebraska south dakota north dakota minnesota illinois kansas 
missouri wisconsin arkansas oklahoma colorado and wyoming 
west california nevada oregon washington arizona new 
mexico idaho montana utah alaska and hawaii 
southeast louisiana mississippi tennessee alabama georgia 
florida north carolina west virginia virginia south carolina 
maryland and delaware 
additional photo editors will be hired for the control bureaus 
of each region to edit and transmit pictures from bureaus and 
newspapers in the states under their jurisdiction additional staff 
also will be hired to install the darkrooms and train member 
newspaper staffs ap will set up a fulltime help desk to assist 
members with the changeover 
black and white pictures currently are transmitted in about nine 
minutes and color in 30 minutes when fully implemented 
photostream will allow delivery of black and white pictures in one 
minute and color in three minutes 
the ap also announced it would use the ap leaf picture desk for 
its internal photo computer system and would discontinue 
development and marketing of the ap vax picture desk which runs on 
digital equipment corp computers 
the ap leaf picture desk exceeds our expectations in power 
speed and functionality said john reid ap vice president and 
director of communications and technology work on new features 
is proceeding rapidly members attending anpatec saw the 
difference and demonstrated an overwhelming preference for the 
leaf 
if an ap member newspaper does not want an ap leaf picture desk 
it may keep its present photo receiver or accept a twominute 
receiver or it may choose to buy an electronic darkroom from 
another company in which case ap will provide a rebate of 47 
weekly for five years effective on the date the member would have 
received its ap leaf picture desk 
the present photo receiver will be left in place at sites where 
an ap leaf picture desk is installed 
members receiving an ap leaf picture desk and photostream will 
be assessed a surcharge of between 15 and 80 weekly depending on 
circulation

a newspaper cannot be held liable for 
breaking a promise of confidentiality to a source the minnesota 
supreme court ruled in rejecting a 700000 award against the 
states two biggest daily papers 
lawyers for both sides agreed the 42 ruling july 20 has 
farreaching implications for the nations news organizations 
the court rejected a jurys award of 200000 in compensatory 
damages and 500000 in punitive damages to dan cohen 
cohen had sued the saint paul pioneer press and the star tribune 
of minneapolis for 1982 stories identifying him as the source of 
documents showing a democratic candidate for lieutenant governor 
had been convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier 
cohen then a republican gubernatorial candidates consultant 
had given the newspapers reporters the information in return for 
assurances of confidentiality but the newspapers editors 
overruled the reporters believing readers should know the 
information came from the gop candidates campaign 
the supreme court upheld an appeals courts dismissal of cohens 
claim of fraudulent misrepresentation but reversed the appeals 
courts ruling allowing him to claim breach of contract 
to impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an 
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship 
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that 
ethical relationship associate justice john simonett wrote 
the court also said enforcement of the promise of 
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract 
where none exists would violate the newspapers first amendment 
rights 
cohens lawyer elliot rothenberg said he would appeal to the 
us supreme court 
the associated press filed the only friendofthecourt brief in 
the case cohens victory at trial had produced a spate of similar 
lawsuits around the country the aps attorneys said 
the breachofcontract theory was being used by plaintiffs 
elsewhere to avoid the constitutional obstacles that stand in the 
way of winning privacy and libel suits said dick winfield an 
attorney for the ap 
the minnesota ruling is the first definitive opinion by a 
state supreme court directly addressing the issue and the media 
can take considerable comfort in the case he said 
joel r kramer executive editor of the star tribune said his 
paper was especially pleased that the court has ruled that the 
decision to publish true facts relating to the activities of a 
political source in a political campaign is one that is protected 
by the first amendment 
but bill salisbury the pioneer press reporter who accepted 
cohens documents and objected strongly to his editors decision to 
identify cohen as the source said the ruling will make his job 
more difficult 
what the ruling tells reporters is that if an editor wants 
to overrule your promise of anonymity to a source he or she can do 
so salisbury said so it will make me much more careful about 
granting confidentialtiy to sources and it will make me much more 
reluctant to reveal the names of my sources to editors

the boston globe filed the first legal challenge 
to the states new tax package july 19 claiming it is 
unconstitutional to tax the materials used to publish a newspaper 
the tax package which became law a day earlier not only 
broadens the 5 percent sales tax to hundreds of business services 
it also extends the tax to the materials and equipment used to 
publish a newspaper or transmit a broadcast 
the globes suit in supreme judicial court did not raise the 
issue of broadcasters instead the globe argued massachusetts law 
exempts manufacturers from paying a sales tax on raw materials and 
tools used in production and thus it would be discriminatory to 
apply such a tax to newspaper companies 
newspaper publishers are the only manufacturers of tangible 
personal property excluded from the manufacturing exemptions the 
lawsuit said 
the globe also argued the tax law opens the possibility of 
burdensome taxation on the press that could obstruct critical 
comment about the government 
robert mehrman head of the massachusetts broadcasters 
association said he could not discuss whether radio and television 
stations also would file suit against the tax 
the globes suit pointed to a similar tax that was enacted in 
minnesota and struck down in 1983 by the us supreme court 
minnesota taxed the ink and paper used by publishers while other 
businesses using those products were not subject to the tax the 
supreme court said differential taxation of the press ran 
counter to the rights guaranteed by the first amendment and said 
the state did not show a compelling reason to permit the tax

in announcing the program july 16 state police hailed it as a 
new wave in citizen crimefighting but civil libertarians warned 
that the program under which tips can be mailed or phoned in 
anonymously will create a society in which people spy on each 
other

coupons on its own and invited people to mail them to state police 
federal state and local authorities arrested 46 people in mingo

the labor department is looking into the 
possibility that its june unemployment report was leaked to traders

the matter involves the monthly report released july 6 on

market activity 
when the report is released each month news organizations are 
given copies at 8 am on the condition that the contents not be 
released until 830 am markets can rise or fall based on this 
information and its release even a minute prematurely has drawn 
the departments ire in the past

a proposed uniform libel law under which courts 
would decide whether statements are true or false before 
determining appropriate damages would not guarantee first amendment 
rights for defendants critics say 
the uniform defamation act is the first proposal for a 
nationwide standard in libel disputes it was discussed july 20 by 
the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws a 
group appointed by the nations governors to draft model 
legislation 
the 28page draft outlines a twostage procedure for libel 
trials a court would first determine whether a statement under 
question was true or false only later during the trials second 
stage would a court decide what if any damages to assess 
safeguards for the press protection if a reporter acted 
without malice or allowances made if a plaintiff is a public 
official would not apply in the trials first stage 
the committee said the draft was based on the premise that 
plaintiffs are more interested in clearing their names than in 
receiving damages 
harvey perlman dean of the university of nebraskas college of 
law and author of the draft said the proposed laws intent was to 
protect plaintiffs reputations better but it also would benefit 
news organizations 
under the proposal news organizations could print retractions 
or pay a plaintiffs legal fees after the first stage a provision 
proponents say would shorten trials and reduce the amount of 
damages awarded 
we wanted to create some incentives for the plaintiff to stop 
early perlman said 
but critics argue the committees desire to design safeguards 
for a persons reputation would create a chilling effect on the 
first amendment 
one of our central concerns is the committees desire to move 
the law in favor of the plaintiff said henry r kaufman counsel 
for the libel defense resource center there will be a chilling 
effect if the media believes it is going to face higher costs and 
greater burdens of libel and litigation 
others at the annual conference questioned creating one standard 
for an intricate field of first amendment law and court decisions 
i dont feel its an area of the law where you can provide a 
uniform act said john mcclaugherty a lawyer from charleston 
wva the first amendment is constantly being reinterpreted and 
by the time a law was passed it would already be out of date 
the earliest a proposal would be redrafted and returned to the 
350member conference would be next year perlman said but no date 
was set for a vote

maines highest court rejected a 
television stations attempt to withhold portions of a videotaped 
interview sought by a prosecutor as evidence in a criminal 
investigation 
officials of wcshtv declined to comment on the july 20 ruling 
saying they would meet with the stations lawyers to plan their 
next move 
in its unanimous decision the maine supreme judicial court 
dismissed the stations assertion that first amendment guarantees 
of a free press established a qualified privilege to protect 
the portions of the interview with biddeford police commissioner 
denis letellier that were not broadcast 
the justices said it was essential a york county grand jury view 
the full 12minute tape as part of its investigation into 
allegations that letellier used his position to get a motor vehicle 
charge against his son reduced 
after the tape was subpoenaed the station turned over the 2 
minutes of the interview that appeared on the air but withheld the 
unused portions 
the court based its ruling on a 1972 decision by a divided us 
supreme court that said a a proper balance must be struck on a 
casebycase basis between freedom of the press and the obligation 
of all citizens to provide relevant testimony about criminal 
conduct 
the public interest in the integrity of the biddeford police 
and city officials and in the effectiveness of the york county 
grand jury proceedings far outweighs any discernible impairment 
that the required production of the nonconfidential letellier 
videotape outtakes might conceivably cause to the first amendment

fundraising claims filed incorrect reports with state agencies 
and thwarted inspection of public documents 
pine wrote followup articles about a state investigation into 
the societys operations and an eviction action involving the 
office where the society had done business 
the words themselves have caused the society to be regarded 
with scorn contempt ridicule and disrespect by the community and 
will continue to for the foreseeable future as they attack the 
societys reputation in the conduct of its affairs according to 
the suit filed in martin circuit court 
the suit seeks more than 5000 in damages on each of three 
counts stephen papy a miami lawyer said donations and ticket 
sales had dropped because of the articles 
the news reported june 30 that an investigation by the state 
attorney generals consumer protection and fair trade practices 
unit found the society was operating within the law 
assistant attorney general mark barnett said then do things 
look fishy definitely there are things that should raise 
questions in donors minds is it illegal no not under the 
current laws 
pine a reporter at the news since january 1988 said he stands 
by his stories i am very confident that the information 
contained in them is factual and was presented without bias or 
malice he said 
thomas e weber editor and president of the news agreed 
i think the suit is a measure of how far off the track the

the society to use its resources than to sue the newspaper weber

patch provided by another radio station which broadcast the 
consultations live 
in the aftermath of the july 16 earthquake which left hundreds 
of people dead radio and television stations didnt only report 
the news they helped rescuers and worried relatives circumvent 
poor communications and served as a spur to a clumsy unresponsive 
bureaucracy 
broadcasters directed rescuers to areas of destruction relayed 
messages to family members separated by the disaster and solicited 
relief goods 
it was the radio stations which were coordinating rescue 
efforts broacasting the need for blood blankets medicines 
earthmoving equipment columnist luis beltran wrote in the 
manila standard government departments went to them for guidance 
on what to send where to send 
after the quake struck provincial affiliates of the major 
networks broadcast the first reports of destruction at that time 
president corazon aquinos staff said only that it was studying 
the extent of the disaster 
provincial officials unable to get through to manila by 
telephone broadcast appeals to the capital for assistance over 
private stations 
radio and television reporters traveled through the affected 
area and briefed government officials about which towns and cities

they served as effective alternatives to government agencies

initiative and the ability to respond quickly former labor

large segments of time on the airwaves 
for a lasting time the television was under the party 
influence what we used to call and still call the party 
monopoly said nenashev who formerly was head of the state 
publishing committee 
now i am more afraid of an orgy of democracy rather than the 
party monopoly when the monopoly is replaced by numerous demands 
put forth by various groups parties various councils various 
organs he said 
hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in

a radical iranian newspaper said july 16 
that many western reporters sent to cover events in iran were spies 
and warned the government to beware 
the persianlanguage jomhuri islami which reflects the views of 
government hardliners said many western journalists visited iran 
to fulfill their missions assigned by the zionists and western 
spying agencies 
the article which was obtained by the associated press in 
cyprus blamed officials of the ministry of islamic guidance which 
is in charge of regulating the activities of foreign reporters for 
giving reporters too much freedom on their trips to iran 
journalists who visit iran are assigned agents from the ministry 
who accompany them on all trips outside their hotels reporters are 
also required to submit their film and tapes to ministry officials 
for approval 
it is simplicity if we think that the cia the israeli 
mossad and other intelligence services simply use one device to 
obtain information from iran the newspaper said in addition 
to their set formula they send reporters photographers and 
cameramen as a coverup 
the iranian government allows few western news organizations to 
base representatives in iran and other reporters are allowed to 
visit the country only on special occassions recently reporters 
were allowed in to cover the first anniversary of the death of 
irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the june 
earthquake that left about 40000 people dead 
among the examples cited by the newspaper of nonjournalistic 
activities during the visits 
a reporter from a major british televsion network tried to take 
an unauthorized photograph of a refinery 
another british radio journalist visited downtown tehran and 
tried to compile a report of illegal black market sales of hard 
currency 
a danish reporter tried to compile a negative report of the 
economy

in hong kong by dow jones amp co of the united states

singaporean readers and restrict coverage of international 
economic meetings for all asians 
in 1987 the government required the journal to reduce its daily 
circulation here to about 500 copies from 5000 the review was

the high court ruled july 18 that a county 
authority committed a flagrant abuse of power in withdrawing 
its advertisements from a publication owned by rupert murdoch 
the court said derbyshire county councils action was vindictive 
and made a gross attempt to deceive the court about its reasons 
the council claimed the ban on advertising in the times 
educational supplement was prompted by legitimate educational 
reasons but the twojudge panel ruled it was vengeance against the 
murdochowned sunday times for publishing articles criticizing 
council leader david bookbinder 
such decisionmaking could only have been prompted by bad 
faith or in a word vindictiveness said judge tasker watkins 
quashing the ban as unlawful he said it was a bad example of 
local authority maladministration which is potentially if not 
actually harmful to the interests of education in derbyshire 
local authorities control education in england and have budgets 
to advertise for school staff 
the council switched its advertising to the guardian newspaper 
which charges higher rates and reaches a much smaller readership in

prevalence of advertising disguised as educational materials a 
consumer group says 
consumers union said july 17 that many purported teaching aids 
donated by businesses contain pitches for those businesses 
products some of the comeons are direct others surreptitious it 
said 
schools often acquiesce to the handouts because they cant 
afford to buy unbiased new materials the report said students 
fall victim because they are unlikely to question advertising 
disguised as schoolwork the group said 
the result schools are becoming heavily sponsored by 
corporations marketing products the report said theyre 
selling the kids entrusted to them to any bidder 
the study also criticized other forms of advertising aimed at 
children including ads in childrens magazines that are disguised 
as editorial copy the use of celebrities to promote products ads 
camouflaged as entertainment and licensing deals that put popular 
symbols on a vast array of products 
interest in the issue of advertising in schools was heightened 
last year by the advent of channel one a video news program for 
pupils that includes commercials schools receive the program and 
viewing equipment free 
consumers union called channel one the tip of the iceberg 
and listed examples of selfpromotion in corporatesupplied

fcc officials staged surprise inspections at 
30 major market television and radio stations to check whether they 
are offering political candidates the lowest possible advertising 
rates 
the fcc held its firstever audits of broadcasters july 1617 
prompted by what an agency news release called an obligation to 
assure that broadcast stations are complying with political 
programming laws and rules especially in an election year 
the inspections carried out in five cities kicked off an 
auditing process that is expected to be completed before the fall 
congressional elections 
the audits were not the result of any complaint said milton 
graves chief of the fccs political division 
this is just a part of overseeing how the stations are 
complying he said we want to know what their practices are 
the fcc sent field inspectors to stations in cincinnati 
dallasfort worth philadelphia san francisco and portland ore 
in each city they visited four television stations an am radio 
station and an fm radio station 
under fcc regulations the lowest unit charge is available to 
political candidates 45 days before primary balloting and six days 
before a general election candidates may purchase single broadcast 
advertisements for the same price as commercial advertisers who buy 
a number of spots in the same time period 
the subject of political advertising rates has been a sore spot 
in congress where proposals are pending that would guarantee that 
candidates get the lowest rates without fear of being preempted by 
commercial advertisers who come in and offer to pay higher rates

10000 for broadcasting allegedly indecent comedy routines 
the federal communications commission sent a letter july 19 to 
great american television and radio co of cincinnati which owns 
wfbq advising it of the fine 
the fcc found that portions of five broadcasts of the bob and

and vulgar language dwelling on depictions or descriptions of 
sexual organs and activities 
the station was fined the maximum 2000 for each violation the 
station has 30 days to appeal or to pay the fine 
chris wheat station manager said a decision would be made in a 
few days on whether the ruling would be appealed

was understandable and clearly capable of a specific sexual meaning 
and because of the context the sexual import was inescapable

that blew off a united airlines jumbo jet and caused nine people to 
be swept to their death over the pacific 17 months ago 
investigators hope the door will help them establish beyond 
doubt the cause of the accident 
during the weeklong search a deepsea probe equipped with sonar 
and a video camera will be dragged across a 24squaremile area 
about 100 miles southwest of honolulu 
if the door is spotted another device will be used at a later 
date to recover it

ability bush said the president went on to praise brennan as 
well calling the courts longtime leading liberal one of the 
greatest figures of his age brennan resigned last friday 
souter stood at bushs side as the president made his surprise

the busiest month yet for the savings and loan 
bailout ballooned the federal budget deficit to 112 billion in 
june a month when corporate tax payments usually produce a 
surplus the government said monday 
the shortfall compared with a 78 billion surplus in june 
1989 brought red ink for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to 
1631 billion more than half again as much as the 1054 billion 
deficit at this time last year 
if the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace it could 
top the record fiscalyear deficit of 2211 billion set in 1986 
the white house office of management and budget is officially 
forecasting a budget gap of 2185 billion just short of the 
record 
white house negotiators and congressional leaders are attempting 
to put together a major deficitreduction pact for fiscal 1991

after three generations of uneasy coexistence 
with the communists in the kremlin the moslems of central asia are 
asserting themselves anew this is the second installment of a 
fourpart series based on an ap special correspondents journey 
through the soviet south

a stonework galaxy of crescent moons 
has risen above the jagged outlines of tombs in the 1000yearold 
chigotai cemetery symbolically ending the long soviet eclipse of 
islam 
now communist party officials mourn their dead in the open 
instead of performing moslem rites secretly at home the aged 
guardian told visitors 
from ashkabad to alma ata across a 1200mile sweep of the 
soviet union central asians are embracing allah with the fervor of 
longlost prodigal sons 
on fridays row after row of barefoot bearded men in braided 
skullcaps chant centuriesold litanies and bow not toward moscow 
but to mecca 
koranic schools are filling with youngsters and countless 
mosques are reopening i cannot even say how many said 
mohammed zakhir deputy grand mufti of central asia but a new 
one opens every week it is endless 
religious leaders insist the new mood is joyous rather than 
militant a sign that tenacious faith has prevailed over an 
ideology that used propaganda and sometimes brute force to try to 
wipe it out 
this is no revival of islam because it was never dead said 
a tashkent professor who asked not to be quoted by name we 
always did in private what we can now do in public 
in fact many central asians say islam is an important force in 
the new political current carrying five of the soviet unions 15 
republics further away from moscow 
at the rural level power slipping away from local communist 
party officials is shifting to imams and in cities the party 
curries favor with the clergy 
an aggressive new attitude is evident in scattered outbreaks of 
violence 
in may in the crowded fergana valley east of this old uzbek 
capital witnesses said masked fundamentalist leaders led youths on 
a rampage of burning and looting in an apparent play for power 
three months earlier and farther south in dushanbe capital of 
mountainous tadzhikistan western visitors reported that moslem 
faithful went directly from praying to rioting and to demanding 
the resignation of local officials 
tashkent and the populous republic of uzbekistan are shared by 
nearly 100 ethnic groups with beliefs ranging from orthodox islam 
to marxist atheism in many areas they compete intensely for land 
housing and jobs 
mostly islam is a conduit for new feelings of identity for 
central asians it is as much a way of life as a religion the 
arbiter of family life community traditions and spiritual values 
from the first russian incursions to the south islam was a 
principal target and many soviet moslems say they feel a 
deepseated prejudice against russian people 
after the 1917 russian revolution moscow condemned islam as 
divisive superstition and sought to eliminate it along with other 
religions 
most mosques were closed and many were destroyed during some 
periods islam was banned outright more often it was vilified by 
intense propaganda and faithful moslems had to choose between 
allah and advancement in a partycontrolled society no muezzins 
wailed from minarets before prayer hardly a trickle of soviet 
moslems made it to mecca for the annual pilgrimage 
these past oppressions are ending said usmonhon alimov 
imam of the graceful albukhari mosque near samarkand among the 
few islamic holy sites to remain mostly unmolested since the 1920s 
young men are flocking to the faith openly and mosques are 
being established in every village he said 
today 55 million moslems most of them in central asia make up 
a fifth of the national population and every second child born in 
the soviet union is a moslem 
a decade ago during the height of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis 
islamic revolution in neighboring iran powerful iranian radio 
transmitters urged moslem brothers to rise up against the soviet 
state at the time moscow was at war in afghanistan deploying 
some central asian soldiers against anticommunist moslem 
guerrillas 
today although moslem militancy seems to be growing political 
analysts see only limited outside meddling from across the iranian 
and afghan borders in soviet central asia fundamentalists are far 
outnumbered by more moderate moslems and shiites khomeinis 
branch of islam by sunni moslems 
but analysts say the potential for panislamic militancy is a 
serious cause for concern common values and even blood ties draw 
together populations separated for 70 years by an impenetrable 
border 
stanislav prozorov head of an islamic studies group in the 
soviet academy of sciences faults soviet leaders for misreading 
moslems ignoring them on one hand and overreacting on the other 
recently he told the daily paper komsomolets uzbekistana he saw 
a definite danger of an islamic explosion because of 
islamophobia on the part of soviet leaders and thinkers 
frustrated moslems might unite and respond with unpredictable 
vehemence he said had the kremlin understood islam in soviet 
asia it would never have invaded afghanistan he added 
western scholars agree michael rywkin of city college of new 
york has described growing masses that are practically 
unassimilable and indifferent to most official soviet values 
in march anatolii lukyanov chairman of the soviet national 
parliament met with the grand mufti of central asia mukhammad 
sadik mukhammad yusuf to discuss islamic affairs 
the 36yearold mufti was named chairman of the religious board 
of moslems of central asia last year after widespread complaints 
that his predecessor toadied to moscow 
in the meeting he assured soviet leaders he supported 
perestroika and was trying to help free captured soviet soldiers in 
afghanistan 
but in april on moscow television he sharply criticized the 
kremlin for interfering in islamic affairs and not giving moslem 
leaders the same access to the media as the russian orthodox 
hierarchy 
he said that because of ignorance of islam official policy 
tried to restrict the religion rather than take advantage of its 
ability to inspire social change and ethnic harmony 
episodes of zealotry should not raise fears that the fading 
soviet states will give way to harsh new islamic regimes central 
asian leaders say 
imam alimov blamed fanatics for trampling womens rights 
abusing nonmoslem settlers and frightening people whose ideas of 
islam were colored by fundamentalist excesses elsewhere 
these things are holdovers from the past the result of 
oppression he said people are learning again about islam 
young men are studying the koran these things will change

each year about 4 million babies are born in the 
united states about 200000 of them with serious defects in the 
past decade however pediatric surgeons working with sophisticated 
and tiny instruments have been able to make remarkable repairs to 
newborn babies now they are even going inside the fetus opening a 
new medical frontier 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the fetus that incredible assembly of cells following its own 
blueprint toward human life was once a citadel as daunting to 
doctors as the human brain not anymore 
the surgeons knife is entering the womb to correct errors of 
nature in the fetus only 23 weeks into pregnancy a 1pound 
humanoid with arms the size of your little finger a heart the size 
of a walnut and tiny lungs that would fit inside the skin of an 
orange 
these dramatic techniques and some to come that are even more 
dramatic are used to rescue a very few fetuses just as heart 
repair and transplants are used for very few newborns 
not everyone agrees that fetal surgeries are appropriate or even 
necessary rarely some doctors say are they so critical that they 
cant be postponed until after birth with the same results 
but they offer a window to the future a future that is not very 
far off 
and they reflect the advances in pediatric surgery over the last 
decade a decade that has seen newborn heart transplants become 
almost commonplace with doctors reaching into tiny chests to do 
all kinds of shunts and plumbing repairs restructuring valves 
replacing what nature forgot 
of the 4 million or so live births each year in the united 
states about 200000 infants have serious defects and about 40000 
of those die there is a lot of work to do 
researchers are working now on ways to implant cells or genes 
into 12weekold fetuses whose functions are limited because of the 
lack of even a single enzyme or protein their cells are missing a 
vital blueprint to make those chemicals and ensure normal growth 
but for the time being at least fetal surgery remains 
anatomical the fixing of structures gone awry 
the most recent instance a surgeon in san francisco opens the 
womb makes a 2inch incision in the chest wall of the fetus below 
the ribs on the left side 
he finds what the soundpictures told him he would the 
diaphragm that separates the chest and abdominal cavities has not 
grown properly a disorder that occurs once in only 2000 
pregnancies 
the organs and intestines from the lower cavity are crushing the 
developing left lung he delicately rearranges things patches the 
diaphragm to hold everything in the right place and departs the 
sanctity of the womb to let the pregnancy progress 
his patient the mother delivers a normal baby 
but in six attempts at this kind of surgery only two fetuses 
have survived 
what astonishes the doctors is these fetuses heal without a 
scar says the surgeon dr michael r harrison of the university 
of california san francisco 
now he and his colleagues are trying to find out why is it 
something the youthful cells produce that allows that kind of 
healing and what would that mean to the adult world that is not so 
equipped 
at the very least harrison says it suggests it might be a good 
idea to correct some serious defects to the fetus before birth to 
take advantage of this scarless healing 
he emphasizes how few are the candidates for any of these new 
advances in pediatiatric and fetal surgery 
what makes much of it possible is the diagnosis of many ailments 
shortly after gestation 
in the 1970s chinese and soviet scientists discovered that they 
could look into the future of the fetus by studying the chorionic 
villi the primordial placental cells the gestational bed in the 
uterus they used a needle to enter the uterus very early in 
pregnancy and using suction they removed some of the villi for 
study this is chorionic villi sampling or cvs developed as an 
alternative for amniocentesis which is an analysis of the fluid in 
the womb which cannot be done as early 
concurrent with the refinement of this work was the use of 
ultrasound to actually picture the fetus in the womb enabling 
doctors to see what they were doing 
i guess the basic idea is that we can do bone marrow 
transplants a whole lot better before birth harrison says 
but what of the rejection problem 
working with sheep and monkeys harrison says amazingly the 
rejection was circumvented if you took stem cells the 
bloodforming cells from the liver at a time when the liver acts as 
the bone marrow 
were using fetal cells that wont recognize they are not at 
home it seemed like a fantastic script and it is 
the alternative strategy is rather than transplanting the 
whole cell why not transplant the gene harrison says the 
gene folks are getting so clever that they are pretty close to 
being able to do that 
rejection is still the major problem in newborn heart 
transplants and so they are not considered a cure for a bad heart 
in the traditional sense of the word cure they are only a 
treatment and patients with transplanted hearts must continue to 
take antirejection medicine for the rest of their lives 
which is why a heart transplant is a lastditch method surgeons 
try first to repair the heart its malformed valves its missing 
chambers its badly arranged plumbing 
the heart of a newborn is about the size of a plum yet surgery 
is possible shortly after birth if not always practical 
a heart transplant is an openheart procedure and it is 
technically sometimes much less demanding than some of the repairs 
that we are doing says dr jan m quaegebeur who has recently 
come to new yorks columbiapresbyterian babies hospital from the 
netherlands 
we know that babies are strong enough to go through the 
operations the question is whether you have to do a transplant 
the reason you would do a transplant is because you have doubts you 
could do a good repair 
the human heart is in essence a pumping machine the right side 
of which pumps blood to the lungs to be oxygenated while the left 
side sends the freshened blood coursing through the body again 
taking oxygen to distant tissues and picking up carbon dioxide for 
exhalation from the lungs

when a baby is born with an underdeveloped left or right 
ventricle the main pumping chambers of the heart it basically has 
a singlechamber heart 
it was just such a maldevelopment that led to the first infant 
heart transplants 
two early attempts dating back to one in 1967 were failures 
then in 1984 dr leonard bailey of loma linda university medical 
center near los angeles transplanted a baboon heart into a 
12dayold infant known only as baby fae 
baby fae survived only 20 days the crossspecies transplant was 
more a reflection of the lack of human donors than anything else 
baby fae would have surely died if nothing were done desperation 
is sometimes the mother of progress 
thirteen months later bailey transplanted a human infant heart 
into the breast of a 14 day old codenamed baby moses who was 
discharged a month and a half later in 1986 that transplant took 
and the heart grew with its recipient eddie anguiano who will be 
5 years old in november 
since then bailey has done some twothirds of the nearly 70 
infant heart transplants performed at loma linda 53 of which 
survive 
to this day not everyone agrees heart transplants are the 
answer there may be other repairs that would do as well 
you cant make a fourchamber heart out of a twochamber heart 
or a threechamber heart says dr welton gersony of 
columbiapresbyterians babies hospital the structures are just 
missing but we have found great success with a total bypass of the 
missing right heart allowing the blood to flow from the veins 
directly into the lungs 
thats an exciting area weve shown you can live without a 
chamber on the right side 
in short surgeons have made considerable progress on infant 
heart repair since doctors in england showed how to inflate a tiny 
balloon in infant heart valves to force them to enlarge 
if we look at the scope of operations that have been performed 
on different kinds of abnormalities we can do good operations with 
low mortality in the first year of life mortalities of two or 
three percent quaegebeur says now there are diseases which 
are so severe that we dont have a good anatomical correction 
it is conceivable that something might be done in the fetal 
stage in those cases he says 
in the last decade a group of surgeons dedicated to repairing 
as completely as possible and as early as possible virtually every 
defect have come to the fore gersony says not all are of equal 
proficiency although many try 
essentially what we have is earlier and earlier repair and 
theres a logic to it to make the heart normal as early as 
possible 
harrison and his fellow fetal surgeons think as early as 
possible means in the womb 
besides correcting the herniated diaphragms he has entered the 
uterus to fix blocked bladders so the fetus can urinate this is 
important to prevent damage to the kidney and the lungs 
it took us many years to find out but the simple answer is 
most of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is made up of 
fetal urine if the block wont let the kid pee then the fluid 
goes away the uterus collapses on the kid and that affects his 
lung growth 
he is also working on animals to see if it is practical to 
unblock the ducts in the brain that allow spinal fluid to vent 
when blocked the spinal fluid backs up and produces the enlarged 
heads of hydrocephalus 
a couple of very interesting things that will be done have 
been done involve tumors harrison says one is a benign 
growth in the lung it gets so big it impairs lung development we 
dont talk about things until they are published but it is ready 
along the same lines is a teratoma a growth that emerges on the 
fetus back and sometimes becomes as large as the fetus itself it 
kills by stealing the fetus blood harrison says it needs to be 
removed in the uterus 
there is also the case of the slow heart apparently because of 
an electrical block in the heart muscle 
the kid is perfectly normal in every other way except the 
heart beats so slowly about 45 beats a minute that the kid dies 
now the solution to that would be to implant a pacemaker in the 
fetus 
harrison tends to view the developing of a child as a continuum 
but the medical profession is reluctant to go that far in treating 
its patients there are certain ethical problems that go to the 
life of the mother 
the origin of 95 percent of the maldevelopment at birth is 
happenstance as opposed to inherited genetic problems 
in the complex process that begins with simple cell division 
then to differentiation nature makes rare mistakes a miracle in 
itself 
of all the things that go wrong the heart is the most 
correctable the toughest part of heart transplantation is the 
availability of hearts 
if surgeons differ on when and how they do not differ much on 
their personal involvement or their dedication or their 
vulnerability 
for quaegebeur the expert in newborn surgery i am better at 
it now than i was a few years ago i still have problems when i 
have to go back and speak to the parents bringing good news is 
easy and even then you cant become involved emotionally its 
more difficult naturally when you have to bring bad news it 
still troubles me i am not emotionally detached 
when im doing the surgery it is a different matter you are 
in this heart and with that surgical team you are not with the 
family you are trying to get everything done and that means you 
have to remain professional 
for fetal surgeon harrison we dont give up we work as hard 
as we can until we succeed or the fetus dies

when susan cox was pregnant with her second 
child she had a suspicion that something was wrong 
call it maternal instinct 
the doctors did constant tests to reassure me that everything 
was fine she says but i just couldnt believe it 
the 30yearold woman so reveres life that she named her 
daughter zoe and planned to name a son vidal words derived from 
life in other languages 
when the baby was born the doctors told her he was just fine 
except that he was just cold and a little blue 
ingy as the boy came to be called after his middle name 
ingmar was in intensive care hours after he was born in 
morristown nj he was transferred to columbiapresbysterian 
babies hospital in new york city the next day 
his case demonstrates the uneven road of pediatric heart 
surgery and some of the pitfalls along the way 
ingy is 3 years old now a lively bright bundle of energy who 
has had four brushes with death 
at babies hospital a more complete examination of his heart 
showed it had inverted ventricles the pumping chambers with no 
connection to the pulmonary artery that carries blood to the lungs 
in addition there was a wide hole between the reversed ventricles 
it was one screwedup heart as one hospital staffer put it 
the first surgery came when ingy was 4 days old a shunt was 
installed from one pumping chamber to the pulmonary artery a block 
developed and 10 days later the infant was operated on again and a 
new shunt was installed 
for three years ingy seemed to be living a normal active life 
but then he began turning blue again a third operation showed he 
had outgrown the shunt it was replaced and the hole between the 
two pumping chambers was fixed it was as close as surgeons could 
come to a complete repair considering what they started with 
there were ups and downs in the ensuing months after the family 
moved to princeton nj ingy developed respiratory problems and 
then heart failure that miraculously reversed itself the doctors 
ascribed the heart failure to a virus and postponed any further 
work until after december 
god gave us christmas mrs cox says we had a wonderful 
christmas 
then ingy developed pneumonia this time the surgeons decided 
that no further repair was possible the only alternative was a 
heart transplant 
at babies hospital it is dr daphne hsus job to find a heart 
and type it to see if it is immunologically compatible with a 
potential recipient 
we get our donors from the same kind of tragedies as those 
that supply our adult patients accidents neurological ailments 
even tumors she says well take hearts from donors who have 
problems that dont involve the heart because our donor supply is 
so limited 
the only supply of hearts for newborns are the hearts of other 
newborns the heart has to be about the same size as that of the 
child who will receive it besides being immunologically compatible 
and there is urgency a heart will keep only four hours after it 
is removed kidneys can be kept viable longer but a heart has to 
be rushed to an airport flown to where the sick recipient is and 
sped to the bedside 
they found a heart for ingy on valentines day this year 
we were very lucky to get a heart within a week susan cox 
says most kids have to wait weeks even months getting sicker all 
the time 
this is not a cure she says its a treatment thats one 
thing that really has to be emphasized 
for the rest of his life ingy will have to take the drugs that 
suppress his immune system and ensure that he will keep his heart 
we lost a couple of teenagers who were feeling so good they 
didnt think of themselves as sick anymore and quit taking their 
medicine says hsu

he was a crusader for liberal causes forced to 
make a painful decision if he wanted to remain a priest robert f 
drinan had to give up politics now hes found other forums to get 
his views across beginning in a classroom at georgetown 
university heres another article in an occasional series called 
class act 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a decade ago jesuit priest robert f drinan 
was ordered by pope john paul ii to choose between the priesthood 
and his seat in congress 
the clerical collar he still wears speaks of his choice 
in his office at georgetown university law center drinan pulls 
out a thick volume of church law and reads aloud no priest or 
nun may hold any office 
they changed canon law after my case he says now its 
very clear they legitimized their preference its all spelled out 
with long footnotes about drinan 
and then he sums it up sums it up with a bit more bite 
the pope threw me out says drinan known for his espousal 
of liberal causes as a member of the house of representatives from 
massachusetts 
on may 5 1980 drinan accepted the popes order with regret 
and pain 
but neither pain nor regret seem evident in his chosen role as 
drinan the priest nor is it surprising that he chose a ministry in 
the classic jesuit mold the priesthood of the intellect 
his forum is a classroom his subject one that confronts 
conflicts challenges certitudes and stirs the jesuitical juices 
legal ethics 
it is 7 pm as drinan surveys his class gathered in seven rows 
of desks before him in a large room walled with concrete blocks 
painted blue four large television sets are suspended from the 
ceiling but they are silent and drinan speaks without competition 
legal ethics 
anyone who says that legal ethics is an oxymoron a 
contradiction in terms will have to leave the room drinan had 
joked earlier 
but now hes asking questions 
does a lawyer have an obligation to report on his fellow 
lawyers when he sees something wrong 
he tells of a lawyer in chicago who was suspended for a year 
caught between the competing demands of the attorneyclient 
privilege and the obligation to report another lawyers wrongdoing 
was there an injustice drinan asks his students should 
he have gone to jail had his finger cut off or what 
drinan moves out from behind the lectern paces hands shoved 
deep in his pockets continuing the lecture in a strong raspy 
voice 
theres a lawyer in new york who represents the bad lawyers 
he seems to enjoy this line of work maybe youll get into legal 
ethics as a career after this midsummer nights dream 
no 
drinan scrawls case citations and legal rules on a blackboard 
then selects a book from a desk covered with books in staggered 
piles he licks his thumb and turns a page 
we now come to a very juicy subject should you turn in your 
brother and sister lawyers 
drinan interlocks his fingers pulls them apart laces them back 
together 
what to do its not black and white thats the nature of 
it 
drinans fingers splay up framing his balding head 
would you require every lawyer to have malpractice insurance 
there would be a whole new wave of litigation it would bring up 
more problems than it would solve 
drinans hands interlock on his chest 
confidentiality he says this is the biggie this is 
going to haunt you all of your life lawyerclient privilege 
its based on the theory that somewhere in society there must 
be secrecy that someone needs a father confessor 
weve had it for 400 or 500 years and for 400 or 500 years 
lots of people have been banging on the desk and saying why do 
these clowns have this drinan bangs on his desk 
the 90minute class breaks up for the evening 
most of his students are repeats one of them says leaving 
the room he has a real strong following here 
drinan has never been one to avoid controversy and has never 
lacked for a following

he ticked off a list of activities that drew attention in the 
vatican his opposition to the war in vietnam his opposition to 
the military draft his leadership in the abolition of mandatory 
retirement his work from within to abolish the house internal 
security committee formerly the house unamerican activities 
committee 
he listed his work for human rights his campaign to liberate 
imprisoned soviet human rights activist anatoly sharansky his 
involvement in improving us law involving civil liberties crime 
copyright and bankruptcy 
i am grateful to have had these opportunities as a moral 
architect drinan says i can think of no opportunities more 
worthy of the involvement of a priest and a jesuit 
when drinan gave up his vote as a representative of 
massachusetts 4th congressional district he did not give up his 
voice or abandon his liberal causes for two years after his 
departure from congress he served as president of americans for 
democratic action one of the nations most outspokenly liberal 
political organizations 
now he not only teaches but also writes and lectures 
drinans interest in the ethical conduct of the legal profession 
led to the founding three years ago of the georgetown journal of 
legal ethics a publication that has won praise as an important 
source of scholarly ideas and information on issues facing lawyers 
and judges 
a recent issue includes articles on legal malpractice lawyer 
advertising the issue of whether elected judges should disqualify 
themselves in cases involving campaign contributors 
drinan who serves as the journals faculty adviser says 
there has been a renaissance of legal ethics in america and this 
is the bible 
but there is more to the drinan agenda much of it stemming from 
issues he pursued in his decade as a congressman human rights 
civil rights arms control 
since leaving congress drinan has written three books bringing 
his total since 1963 to seven the latest cry of the oppressed 
the history and hope of the human rights revolution 
drinan takes credit for persuading the american bar association 
to endorse the civil rights act of 1990 he soon will become 
chairman of the groups committee on individual rights 
his work has not gone unnoticed 
drinan now holds 20 honorary degrees 11 of them awarded since 
he left congress 
what does he miss about congress 
i still use the swimming pool he says then laughs and 
adds the taxpayers pay for the towels 
i guess the thing i miss most is the parking perks at the 
airport 
but there was more to drinans congressional career than that 
he was in the thick of the battle to end to the war in vietnam 
the issue on which he was first elected 
mr speaker i urge all of these people to make war on war 
drinan said during a 1971 speech 
drinans congressional papers 520 linear feet of them are 
now housed in the archive of boston college drinan was law 
professor and dean of the boston college law school from 1956 to 
1970 
the papers contain the first impeachment resolution ever filed 
against former president nixon it had nothing to do with watergate 
but rather with nixons ordering the us invasion of cambodia 
the archive also records drinans participation in the 
impeachment inquiry conducted later by the house judiciary 
committee 
drinan again pulling books and pamphlets off his shelves says 
here are some more of my babblings 
there is a reprint of an opinion piece in the boston herald 
condemning the us invasion of panama as a violation of 
international law an article in the national catholic reporter 
questioning lotteries and suggesting that gambling can weaken the 
strength of individuals and the nation an article examining the 
political earthquakes in eastern europe

he was called a political prodigy an 
eloquent spokesman for the young israeli nation now he feels the 
jewish state he so strongly defended has taken a wrong turn but 
abba eban at 75 has no real political power now and he vents his 
frustrations mainly through the media 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the cultured cambridgeaccented wit and oratory 
of abba eban once was the voice of israel extolling the young 
nations virtues before the world and defending it from attack by 
its enemies 
the voice has been muted for some time now and when eban at 75 
does speak up he is more likely to admonish than praise the israel 
that has grown up in the past 42 years 
the tall stately former ambassador and politician is saddened 
by what he sees as a besmirched image of israel stemming from the 
incessant conflict with the palestinians in the occupied lands 
i think there is a sense of a paradise lost he says 
there is a kind of broken heart especially among jews about the 
image israel once projected and the image it presents now 
still eban keeps his fervor for the jewish state in articles 
lectures and television appearances the retired diplomat urges a 
return to the israel of his youth even as he damns the israel of 
his advanced years 
he is frustrated by israels political turn to the right 
sharpened in the past 2 years by the palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
he criticizes both the rightwing government of prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and his own leftofcenter labor party which exiled 
him from politics in 1988 by refusing him a nomination to run for 
parliament 
he strongly objects to israels refusal to negotiate with the 
palestine liberation organization or to consider trading occupied 
land for peace a policy the united states advocates for solving 
the middle east conflict 
israel is really tearing up its own birth certificate by 
refusing to share land and offer political rights to the 
palestinians eban said in an interview with the associated press 
eban spoke by telephone from new york city these days he spends 
much of his time abroad on projects that stress israels legacy of 
humanity and enlightenment 
there is salvation and significance for the jew only when he 
stands straight and aims high within his own authentic frame of 
values eban wrote in his book heritage which was made into 
a series for american public television 
the hebrew messianic idea is alive with a sense of hope and 
purpose he wrote it is worthwhile to strive for human 
perfection for social progress for universal peace 
dazzling words for israels jewish ideals accompanied by 
doubts over the governments political actions were a theme of 
ebans career 
the south africanborn eban was always more dovish than israels 
other leaders on the arabisraeli conflict in four decades as 
israels un and us ambassador foreign minister and leading 
member of parliament eban often objected privately to policies he 
supported publicly 
in 1956 he argued bitterly with israels first prime minister 
david bengurion over israels hesitation to withdraw from 
egyptian sinai after the 1956 suez war but he then went before the 
united nations and eloquently defended israel 
it is said bengurion later joked to eban that it wasnt until 
he heard the un speech that i became convinced of why we 
shouldnt withdraw 
today with no real leadership role eban is more publicly 
critical 
israeli newspapers once called eban a political prodigy for 
his youthful success in diplomacy he was only 33 when he became 
israels first un ambassador at the time the youngest head of 
mission at the world body 
in 1950 when eban was 35 he was appointed ambassador to 
washington israels most important diplomatic post he was 48 when 
he was named deputy prime minister and 51 when he got his most 
prestigious post foreign minister 
now he has dropped into political oblivion 
eban said on israel radio recently that he is keeping a 
certain distance from politics in the past he has acknowledged 
that his popularity overseas was not always matched at home 
i could have been elected prime minister if people abroad 
could vote in israeli elections he once jokingly told an ap 
reporter 
ebans home is in herzliya a wealthy tel aviv suburb named for 
theodore herzl who conceived of the jewish state eban and his 
wife of 46 years susan have two grown children a daughter and a 
son who is a clarinetist with the tel aviv philharmonic 
last february ebans 75th birthday went virtually unnoticed in 
israel at the united nations a gala party was thrown sponsors 
included four former us presidents richard nixon gerald ford 
jimmy carter and ronald reagan 
ebans polished british manners and wan complexion from his many 
days in the corridors of power never fit in with israels culture 
of tanned roughhewn nativeborn sabras eban settled in 
israel after world war ii having served as a british liaison 
officer at allied headquarters in jerusalem

his detractors accuse him of being snobbish about his british 
upbringing and education at queens college cambridge he won 
firstclass honors in the classics hebrew arabic and persian 
though he is conversant in 10 languages eban has been 
criticized at home for his formal hebrew 
isser harel former head of the mossad intelligence agency said 
eban always spoke such a literary hebrew rather than the popular 
spoken tongue it never sunk in very well 
in the early 1960s eban as education minister used an 
antiquated phrase for youth while addressing a group of high 
school students one bewildered teenager thought eban was making a 
derogatory remark and shouted at him in protest 
eban at first was disappointed by his fall from political power 
now he says he is happier with a television career in which he 
reaches millions of people 
it is a unique opportunity to try to correct the image of the 
present by bringing the illumination of the past eban says 
in lectures newspaper columns and interviews eban relishes his 
freedom from diplomatic strictures and speaks out sharply against 
israeli policies toward the arabs and the united states 
he feels israel has forsaken the stance of compromise and moral 
rectitude that was the key to world support for the jewish state 
a main target is shamirs rightwing likud bloc which objects 
to relinquishing any of the west bank and gaza it claims the lands 
captured in the 1967 middle east war home to 17 million 
palestinians are integral parts of the historic land of israel 
eban notes israel won world recognition in 1948 only after its 
leaders agreed to partition historic palestine sharing the land 
with the arabs 
as a central witness in the drama i can say that if we had 
claimed that 100 percent of the territory was ours then the 
world would have successfully organized to prevent our emergence 
he says 
so today when the government claims 100 percent of the right 
it is really tearing up its own birth certificate israels birth 
is intrinsically and intimately linked with the idea of sharing 
territory and sovereignty 
he also denounces israels refusal to involve the plo in middle 
east peace moves which has been a stumbling block to starting 
usmediated negotiations 
our policy was always to speak to the adversary eban says 
eban complains too that his own labor party has failed to 
persuade the israeli public of the wisdom of a more conciliatory 
stance 
despite his worries about presentday israel eban does not 
despair when he views the jewish state within the sweep of history 
and jewish destiny 
at one moment eban talks about the blow to israels image from 
the suppression of the intefadeh or palestinian uprising but then 
he quickly recalls that in 1948 the survivors of the nazi holocaust 
founded a new nation 
the intefadeh he says is only an episode in a long 
story

with some 41 million more foreigners expected to 
visit america this year its important for the business executive 
to know how to entertain them that can be complicated depending 
on where theyre from heres a guide to help you avoid cultural 
gaffes such as inadvertently inviting your guests to commit 
harakiri 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
look whos coming to dinner the big 
overseas client 
its decisionmaking time do you 
lock the dog in the basement 
order a dozen longstemmed red roses 
search through the gourmet shops for sheeps eyeballs sea 
slugs and freshfrozen bear paws 
greet the overseas visitor with a slap on the back a firm 
handshake perhaps three kisses on the cheek or will just two 
suffice 
see if the library has a recipe for stirfried bees 
dare do anything about sex after all in many parts of the 
world sex is regarded as a hospitable gesture a normal part of a 
business deal 
the outcome of your entire negotiations may depend on how you 
cope with a crosscultural crisis warns roger axtell a consultant 
and lecturer on worldwide business protocol 
after all trying to seduce a female client or a visiting wife 
is hardly getting things off to a crisp start which as axtell 
points out is what a dozen red roses connotes to a guest from west 
germany 
besides a bouquet of evennumbered flowers is considered bad 
luck in her country where etiquette further dictates that you 
remove the paper first 
make sure the paper is not white if the guest is japanese or the 
flowers purple if the recipient is from brazil or mexico these are 
the colors of death in those climes also white chrysanthemums in 
much of europe and flowers of any kind in kenya convey condolences 
further regarding gifts axtell recalls the curious case of a 
grand rapids mich furniture dealer who didnt know the foreign 
territory playing host at a dinner for buyers from japan he put a 
silver pocket knife as a gift at each place setting his guests 
left the gifts behind in silent dismay at what to them was an 
invitation to commit harakiri 
axtell spent 30 years as vice president of world marketing for 
parker pen co traveling in 80 countries observing and sometimes 
inadvertently committing some of the cultural gaffes that can 
result in an abrupt jagged line on the sales chart and the bosss 
cardiogram 
now a roving consultant on global business behavior axtell has 
just finished his third book the dos and taboos of hosting 
international visitors 
citing department of commerce figures axtell notes that some 41 
million international visitors will come to the united states this 
year and spend 50 billion just for travel food and accommodations 
for the first time there are more tourists arriving than 
departing a 15 billion balance of tourist trade is projected so 
its important that we welcome them by recognizing the differences 
in their cultures their way of having fun and doing business 
axtell warns that a host only invites disaster by attempting 
to duplicate any exotic foreign cuisine better to serve a 
typically american meal with due regard for religious dietary 
regulations but spare the corn on the cob its considered cattle 
food in many countries 
axtell urges a quick course in international body language as a 
basic survival tool in the global market place even a simple yes 
or no gesture can mean the opposite in other cultures

when a visitor from bulgaria or sri lanka nods his head that 
means no a head shake connotes yes a turk signifies no by 
raising his chin shutting his eyes and tilting the head 
backward 
ordinary gestures can convey extraordinary meanings to a foreign 
visitor advises axtell placing your hands on your hips is an 
aggressive gesture to a mexican forming a circle with the thumb 
and forefinger while elevating the other three fingers is a most 
obscene gesture in brazil 
similarly thumbs up is a rude gesture in bangladesh as is 
winking or beckoning with the middle finger in hong kong and 
malaysia 
the japanese he went on dislike being pounded on the 
back touching is unacceptable to them an open mouth is offensive 
so yawns belly laughs and chewing gum are out 
at table the differences can be perplexing a swede 
crisscrossing the utensils on his plate is asking for another 
helping and not signifying he is full among egyptians it is 
impolite to eat everything on the plate in finland it is bad luck 
to pass the salt hand to hand the shaker should be set down before 
the guest a japanese will accept a second helping only if asked 
twice zambians compliment the hostess by asking for seconds 
axtell regrets that toasting is a skill most americans never 
hone but at a dinner or banquet in less than a minute a 
wellcomposed toast can convey more elan and diplomacy than a month 
of slick talk 
unless you are an accomplished linguist axtell warns against 
attempting a toast in the visitors language he once tried 
memorizing the chinese words for thank you for a wonderful 
dinner i ate so much i must loosen my belt later he learned 
what he actually said was i ate so much the girth of my donkeys 
saddle is loose 
but his embarrassment was less than that of an iranian deputy 
oil minister who hoisted a glass at the petroleum club in houston 
with the toast as they say in your country up your bottoms 
but as jimmy carter found out on his 1977 trip to poland using 
an interpreter can sometimes double the trouble 
his interpreter made the arrival speech unforgettable even today 
in warsaw with the translation the president says he is pleased 
to be here in poland grasping your secret parts 
finally there is the question of sex while hosting a foreign 
client is one obliged to arrange for some group interaction in a 
hot tub an allpurpose escort service or a visit to a local 
pleasure palace 
while in other countries sex often is an expected part of 
business entertainment axtell answers not once in over 30 
years of hosting scores of business visitors from all over the 
world did one of them request or show any expectation for a hired 
sexual partner

prowling the streets at night tailing suspects 
bringing the villains to justice is a new type of private eye they 
are women just as savvy and cynical as sam spade or phillip marlow 
and the rest of the macho male bunch that for so long dominated the 
whodunit genre 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sue grafton recalls scheming in the night about 
a way to kill one of her two exhusbands after shed carefully 
worked it out she realized i knew i could never pull it off i 
thought ill just put it in a book 
grafton didnt want to write a psychological novel in which the 
reader identifies with a killer so she created somebody to foil 
her own plot i gave the reader somebody virtuous to identify 
with the wisest move i ever made in my life 
thus was born kinsey millhone one of a new breed of 
professional private investigators who have emerged in the long 
evolution of the whodunit women to stand shouldertoshoulder 
with dashiell hammetts sam spade raymond chandlers phillip 
marlow and ross macdonalds lou archer 
there have always been female detectives in modern literature 
such as agatha christies miss marple but they have been almost 
without exception genteel amateurs the new ones on the other 
hand are professionals 
six months before kinsey millhones first appearance in a is 
for alibi private eye vi victoria warshawski had solved her 
first case in sara paretskys indemnity only 
paretsky who wrote it in 1979 says that too often in american 
crime novels sexually active unmarried women are the villains in 
six of seven chandler novels a sexually active woman is the main 
villain i really wanted to try to counteract that image she 
says 
paretsky was working full time as a manager at an insurance 
company when she started working on the novel 
women were making it into the ranks of management she says 
there were people who pushed us as hard as they could to see if 
wed crack i wanted a woman who was experiencing what i and my 
friends were being challenged on her right to do the job she was 
a pioneer being called an aggressive bitch 
a third private investigator carlotta carlyle was born after 
her creator linda barnes had written four books about amateur 
sleuth michael spraggue 
id always wanted to write a woman pi barnes says as 
soon as i finished the first spraggue in 1981 i talked to my 
editor about doing a woman he told me theres no market for 
hardboiled women since i dont write for posthumous glory i 
figured i would continue with spraggue 
i thought how nice it would be if people would knock on a 
detectives door with problems its very hard to get amateurs 
realistically involved in mysteries i killed off all spraggues 
friends and relatives he was getting very depressed 
each of these female private eyes is divorced each of the 
writers is married all three write in the first person the point 
of view mind and personality the reader gets to know is the 
private detectives and to some extent the writers 
paretsky who was born in iowa and grew up in nebraska lives in 
chicago her husband calls her a pit bull she has had vi tangle 
with corruption in chicago politics great lakes shipping 
malpractice the roman catholic church and vatican bank 
i find it very disturbing the way in which people in large 
institutions can commit tremendous amounts of crime violating 
public trust the damage that can do runs very deep in individual 
lives she says three or four times a week i make these moral 
decisions am i brave enough to write about this issue to stand up 
to this person three times out of five i chicken out 
every day i try to make myself take on the things im afraid 
of vi can do it in a way that i cant i suppose it is that kind 
of integrity and passion that matter most to me 
in contrast to paretskys big issues grafton says my stories 
come out of an instance in the family dynamic i use a small 
canvas the human heart im interested in the dark side of human 
nature what it is that makes us kill each other instead of going 
into therapy as we should

the wooden roller coaster the flagship of 
amusement parks in the roaring 20s is making a noisy comeback 
one reason is nostalgia park operators say the traditional thrill 
ride attracts older people trying to relive their youth others say 
they are just simply more fun whatever the reason new woodies 
are being built in cities across america 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the walls in curtis summers office show that 
times are good for people whose idea of a good time is a 
whiteknuckle ride on a giant wooden roller coaster 
on one wall is a drawing of the american eagle that summers 
designed in 1981 for the great america amusement park in suburban 
chicago at the other end of the room is a picture of his timber 
wolf which opened last year at worlds of fun in kansas city 
in between are some of the coasters he designed in the 1970s 
and other examples of his newly booming business 
were working on no 29 right now summers says 
the past 10 years have been generous to traditionalists who 
forgo the smooth ride of steelframed roller coasters in favor of 
roaring down rougher wooden coasters at speeds that can top 65 mph 
in that time amusement parks have built 21 fullsize wooden 
roller coasters from the judge roy scream built in 1980 at six 
flags over texas between dallas and fort worth to thunder run set 
to open at kentucky kingdom in louisville ky 
the last two or three years have been incredible for building 
coasters in general and wooden coasters are a big part of that 
says mark wyatt who edits the roller coaster newsletter inside 
track 
there are now 80 wooden roller coasters in the united states 
mexico and canada along with 144 steel roller coasters 
three new woodies debuted earlier this year all designed by 
summers the texas giant at six flags over texas the georgia 
cyclone at six flags in atlanta and the predator at darien lake 
park near buffalo ny 
i keep telling everybody you cant be too rich too thin or 
have too many roller coasters they are the staple ride of a theme 
park and they make a great landmark says harold hudson a six 
flags over texas corp vice president whose division supervises 
coaster construction 
dallasbased six flags runs nine wooden coasters and 29 steel 
coasters at its seven theme parks hudson says the company plans 
two more coasters next year both wooden 
one reason is nostalgia hudson says thats what coasters 
were made of in the past and thats what everybody remembers it 
also has a little broader demographics a wooden coaster might get 
older people who might be interested in riding it 
tom timko who runs an information hot line for the 2300member 
american coaster enthusiasts says the heyday for wooden roller 
coasters was the 1920s when an amusement park wasnt considered 
complete without one 
then with the depression a lot of parks closed timko 
says in the 70s with walt disney world they started to get 
popular again 
a wooden coaster the beast built in 1979 at kings island near 
cincinnati has topped inside tracks reader poll of the worlds 
best roller coasters for the two summers the magazine has conducted 
the poll 
the attraction to me anyway is that you have more freedom of 
movement youre out in the air when you get in a steel coaster 
youre sealed in a little car wyatt says the wood coaster is 
a different feeling they move a little bit to take the shock of 
the train going around 
summers says he has received inquiries about designing wooden 
roller coasters for north africa europe korea australia and 
singapore he also is bidding to build the first wooden roller 
coaster in japan 
there are very few wooden coasters outside of north america 
but the demand is everincreasing he says 
summers says a roller coaster he is designing for a midwest 
amusement park will surpass the 67 mph speed of the american eagle 
as well as the texas giants 140foot height record among wooden 
roller coasters 
with presentday speeds we just about have to build a swiss 
watch 150 feet high summers says and you dont want absolute 
smoothness you want a little bit of roughness for that wood feel 
at dorney park in pennsylvania the hercules coaster spreads 
over a hillside that lets cars drop 157 feet in their first dip 
while the coasters structure stands only 95 feet above the ground 
it was a very smart move of them using that hillside where 
nothing else would fit summers says its dynamite to save 
money on structure and get the worlds highest drop on a coaster 
competition for the title of the highest woodie was intense 
enough to lead dorney park to sue six flags in federal court in 
pennsylvania the parks settled in april agreeing that while the 
hercules had the longest drop in the world the texas giant had the 
highest lift

gil gerard still remembers enough chemistry 
to understand the environmental issues tackled in his new cbs fall 
series the earth force 
i used to be a chemist and i can still boil water he says 
gerard worked as a chemist in his native arkansas after college 
he says he was in line to become vice president of a chemical 
company when he decided to become an actor 
in the series which debuts on saturday this fall gerard heads 
an elite environmental group called earth force it stands for 
earth alert research amp tactical headquarters 
the groups mission is to protect the environment from criminals 
polluting the worlds resources and from natural disasters 
when i first began discussing this project i asked where are 
we going gerard says they said it would not be a crisis of 
the week people get bored with that were going to concentrate on 
people stories with an overview of the environment if we tell 
about an oil spill the story will be about its effect on one 
person 
we also want to show people how they can deal with a big issue 
like say depletion of the ozone level people think they might 
not be able to do anything but if 20 million people watch the show 
and do something itll make a big difference 
the series the fourth for gerard also stars joanna pacula 
robert knepper and clayton rohner and two australian performers 
tiffany lamb and stewart finlaymclennan it is a joint 
americanaustralian production and will be made in australia 
gerard plays dr john harding a heart surgeon and geneticist 
and a former green beret 
hardings a guy whos not afraid to take chances gerard 
says i think he has a good overview of what has to be done he 
acts as a leavening agent for the more radical members of the force 
there seem to be some people in the environmental movement who 
seem more intent in polarizing issues than solving them harding 
says lets solve it not beat up on everyone he looks for a common 
ground 
gerard made his series debut in the title role of buck rogers 
in the 25th century on nbc in 1979 he starred in two other 
shortlived series sidekicks and nightingales the latter 
show caused protests from nursing groups for its sexy portrayal of 
student nurses 
it seemed to be begging for some sort of reaction he says 
it was like two different shows there was the show suzanne 
pleshette barry newman and i did and the one with the nurses 
nobody was undressing when we did our part 
after completing nightingales last spring he starred as a 
private detective in final notice for the usa network he has 
an independent feature film soldiers fortune coming out 
soon in that he plays a mercenary who returns from central 
america to find that his daughter has been kidnapped naturally he 
gets her back 
gerard says he hopes to be able to go to australia early enough 
to find a place on the beach to practice his avocation scuba 
diving he also hopes to be close enough to the great barrier reef 
to get in some diving 
first he is off for several days at a training program in 
georgia conducted by the environmental protection agency there he 
will study techniques of surveillance and gathering evidence

in a monumental undertaking the guthrie 
theater celebrates shakespeares history plays this summer with 
stirring sweeping productions of richard ii henry iv 
parts 1 and 2 and henry v 
they are not only monumental pieces of theater but major acting 
and logistical challenges for the regional theater which was 
founded in 1963 by tyrone guthrie 
the three productions with the two parts of henry iv 
combined into one play are being performed in repertory through 
sept 2 with a special encore week of performances oct 913 they 
employ two directors the theaters entire 28member acting company 
and a trio of distinctive settings by design wizard douglas stein 
the effort pays off handsomely its an amazing theatrical 
journey through more than 50 years of english history what makes 
it special is the chance to see these plays together to follow the 
arc of this history from the doomed reign of the foolish foppish 
richard ii to the monarchy of the charismatic henry v who rallies 
his nation to military victory over france 
these works are linked by many of the same characters watch 
bolingbroke turn into a troubled henry iv or the hedonistic prince 
hal grow into an impressive henry v and they reverberate with 
ideas that echo from play to play to play 
among other things the plays are about power how people use 
it and how power uses them in richard ii the king doesnt 
appreciate the power he has until he loses it richard in a 
lyrical galvanizing performance by charles janasz gains spiritual 
strength as he loses control of temporal power 
he stands in contrast to bolingbroke who decisively takes 
control of his life and the crown to become henry iv but once 
king he has little rest from guilt over richards death and 
selfdoubt about his ability stephen yoakam admirably projects 
henrys world weariness the machinations he must go through to 
hold onto the throne 
prince hal also undergoes a transformation as played by barton 
tinapp he goes from roustabout to ruler with remarkable skill 
hes at home with falstaff and the other rowdies at the eastcheap 
tavern but can dismiss them curtly when he is called upon to 
fulfill his royal duty 
steins innovative settings dazzle theres a burnished copper 
design for richard ii a gnarled rustic wooden environment for 
henry iv and then bare exposed rehearsal space for henry v 
with glimpses of the sets from the first two productions as a 
backdrop 
the costumes designed by ann houldward are opulent except 
for one stunning bit of theatricality in henry v in which the 
actors playing the english wear rehearsal clothes the designer 
perhaps took a cue from the opening chorus of henry v which 
entreats the audience to use its imagination in seeing and hearing 
the play 
the three plays were codirected with a fine sense of historical 
pageantry and drama by garland wright the guthries artistic 
director and charles newell a onetime resident director at the 
theater 
garland and i decided early on that the only way we could see 
it work was if both of us were responsible for everything newell 
said in an interview each of us would do all of it 
the idea to do the history play cycle at the guthrie came from a 
plan to have richard iglewski an actor in the company play 
falstaff 
in the winter of 198889 we did a reading of the henry iv 
plays just to listen to them newell said and we realized 
henry iv part 2 had difficulty standing on its own 
then wright had the idea of cradling the two henry iv plays 
between richard ii and henry v 
suddenly it became a very big project said newell it 
was decided the acting company wasnt ready to do that but after 
much thought on garlands part he decided that that very reason 
we werent ready to do it was the reason we should be doing it 
the two directors began informally discussing the plays in july 
1989 in september historians and scholars were brought in to talk 
about the history of the period the manners of the time the 
difference between shakespeares history and actual history 
most helpful were professors of social history newell said 
scholars who could talk about what it was like to live in a 
castle or what was an inn like and who was there and what did 
people eat and drink things that for actors are very useful in 
terms of understanding character 
wright newell and michael lupu the guthries dramaturge 
worked on ways to transform the two henry iv dramas into a 
single work 
we made a decision to try and tell the entire story of what 
both plays were about in one play newell said but we didnt 
want to cut out major sections of the plays as a way to condense 
it rather we wanted to just trim everything that was there and 
somehow compact it 
rehearsals began march 13 nearly three months before the first 
preview performance on june 9 the three shows opened june 30 in an 
allday 12hour marathon 
wright and newell made an unusual decision about those early 
rehearsals the codirectors would do very little talking the first 
month and let the actors find the plays on their own 
we were there to guide and focus but primarily we wanted the 
company to discover the plays themselves as well as to discover 
something about the actual rehearsal process itself newell said 
the actors were encouraged to talk about the scenes they were 
working on it was scary for them because they didnt have a 
single voice or in our case two voices telling them what they 
were going to do newell said 
we had rehearsals in which everybody was in the room at all 
times and anybody could say anything they wanted about the scene 
that we were working on he added suddenly the work became 
about what the company is 
after a month of this work wright and newell split into 
separate rehearsals but they maintained a dialogue with each other 
that allowed them to shape the plays with equal input 
one of the hardest moments was that first day of rehearsal in 
which we were all sitting at tables that had scripts that came off 
the table about 4 or 5 inches newell said the sheer size of 
the project was daunting but like anything that big you just do 
it one step at a time and somehow you get it done

in the heart of asia far from the tumult of the 
kremlin a new mood of defiance and independence is taking hold 
this is the first installment of a fourpart series by an ap 
special correspondent who traveled through the restive soviet south 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
townsfolk in this ancient capital of 
tiled turquoise domes and haunting memories are starting to refer 
to the soviet state in the same past tense they apply to tamerlane 
and genghis khan 
the soviet union is rotting away said alex ulko a young 
painter and english student at the university of samarkand 
within a few years asians will be shaping their own nations 
moscow is omnipresent in soviet central asia from government 
offices and communist party headquarters to donkeyriding kgb 
informants in remote hamlets 
but new political currents rooted in an islamic religious 
revival economic resentment and environmental concerns are 
carrying asian peoples inexorably further from the kremlin 
although lenins ironcast goatee still juts resolutely forward 
in city parks asians revere their own wise men in flowing white 
beards and colored robes who evoke a past few have forgotten a 
past almost palpable at night when islamic chants can be heard down 
twisting lanes shaded by mulberries 
the five central asian republics kazakhstan turkmenistan 
uzbekistan tadzhikistan and kirghizia stretch from the caspian 
sea to china an area almost as big as the united states their 50 
million inhabitants 20 million in uzbekistan make up a fifth of 
the soviet population a few examine 21st century problems in 
nuclear physics and biochemistry but many more live in rag tents 
or mud hovels as in the days of the golden horde 
in some ways central asia is marked indelibly by a century of 
russian czars and commissars but many here see the russian 
interlude as destined to be yet another turn of history no more 
vital to the present than when camels plied the silk road from 
china to europe 
new political parties ecological movements moslem clergymen in 
reopened mosques and young radicals all press for broader freedoms 
leading to independence even local communist party cadres are 
insisting on greater home rule 
perestroika has brought truth but truth has brought unrest 
noted agzam rahmidov an english professor in this old crossroads 
city in uzbekistan 
for one thing central asians complain of economic exploitation 
the uzbekistan prime minister shukrulla mirsaidov contends his 
people pay out three times as much to the central government as 
they get back 
in june uzbekistan and tadzhikistan refused to export food to 
other republics at the low prices decreed by the state later the 
uzbek parliament adopted a preliminary declaration of 
sovereignty 
antimoscow sentiment reaches deep into daily life 
russian settlers are leaving the region at a quickening pace 
spurred by sporadic pogroms against ethnic minorities youths are 
evading the military draft and rebelling against officers they 
accuse of bias 
in a nation fraught with more immediate crises these pressures 
stew largely out of sight 
in june a border clash between uzbeks and kirghizis in the old 
holy city of osh commanded attention as the official death toll 
mounted to as high as 800 but when soviet troops imposed calm the 
spotlight moved on 
the situation in central asia is very serious and we dont 
understand it fully said igor krupnik a conflict specialist at 
the academy of sciences in moscow no one has the data 
the problem central asians say is that distant analysts are 
often thrown off by convenient generalities about peoples who are 
anything but homogeneous 
over millennia borders were traced across the sands by 
conquerors from the mongol hordes to turkish tyrants like 
tamerlane to the russian czars josef stalin drew the last map in 
the 1920s when the regions of turkestan and eastern bukhara were 
transformed into five republics 
the plains of kazakhstan biggest and northernmost of the five 
separate european russia from asia to the south lie the other 
four in the east the small mountainous enclaves of tadzhikistan 
and kirghizia bordering china and afghanistan in the west the 
highlands and deserts of uzbekistan and turkmenistan stretching 
toward the oilfields of the caspian sea 
these central asian neighbors are linked by the koran and often 
by common linguistic roots but just as often they are divided by 
disputes over land and water 
in the soviet grand plan the whole region was given over to 
cotton fields were irrigated from the majestic rivers amu darya 
and syr darya and russian migrants settled frontier lands today 
only 40 percent of the kazakhstan population is kazakh 
but decades of poor planning have so bled the rivers that they 
no longer replenish the aral sea half of the worlds fourth 
largest lake has dried up its exposed lakebed now just loose salt 
poisoned by pesticide runoff to revive the aral sea uzbeks want 
to cut off the karakum canal used by the turkmens to water their 
desert 
land was exploited in the most disgusting colonial way said 
sergei kapitsa of the physical problems institute in the soviet 
academy of sciences 
central asian planners want to diversify from cotton but the 
region is short of energy and the tadzhiks ensconced in high 
mountains balk at flooding villages for more hydroelectic dams 
in this climate of tension an isolated skirmish over a piece of 
scarce farmland like the one in osh can flash overnight into 
pitched battles in capital cities hundreds of miles apart 
explosive mixtures have resulted from past soviet policies of 
dispersing inconvenient minorities to onceremote areas such as 
the fergana valley which includes osh 
last year rampaging uzbeks killed at least 100 people in 
pogroms against turks resettled from georgia almost two generations 
ago other minorities including russians were also targeted

this february an estimated 50 people were killed in riots in 
the tadzhik capital dushanbe reportedly touched off by rumors 
that armenian refugees would settle there in may mobs burned 47 
homes of armenians and jews in the fergana valley 
authorities cite local causes for each outbreak sometimes 
blaming unnamed political opportunists religious fanatics or 
drugcrazed hooligans but others see deeper roots 
the problem is social frustration among a generation of youths 
who are losing their old values and see nothing to replace them 
said munira shadheedi a historian in dushanbe 
opposition politicians mostly writers and other intellectuals 
see a policy vacuum as communist party stalwarts push ahead with 
only modifications of ideas that have failed to inspire confidence 
these new leaders say it is too early to design specific 
programs for independence first most say they must abolish 
entrenched official corruption which impoverishes and embitters 
their populations 
alternative parties are beginning to attract wide support the 
uzbekistan popular front birlik has inspired similar movements in 
other republics krupnik said he saw signs these disparate 
opposition groups were linking up forging the beginnings of a 
grassroots movement across central asia 
their main obstacle is a historical aversion to mixing among 
ethnic groups in the region he said 
if central asia mixes anywhere it is here in samarkand a city 
of 390000 people that recently celebrated its 2500th anniversary 
the old mud synagogue blends unnoticed into a block of moslem 
houses men of all religions wear the same square black skullcaps 
embroidered in white a multitude of nationalities sits together 
for tea and patterned wheels of bread escaping the sun under shade 
trees 
but a chat with samarkand university students suggests that this 
harmony of old is changing fast 
a crimean tatar woman felt growing antipathy and said her family 
wanted badly to get home her russianukrainian friend said uzbeks 
are making up for lost time in reasserting national pride 
there is a very dark fear which is difficult to understand 
concluded a young russian like the others reluctant to be quoted 
by name we see discrimination against others the russians are

mo better blues 
the astonishing spike lee surely the most original of new 
filmmakers succeeds where others have stumbled he has made a jazz 
movie that is both authoritative and entertaining 
bertrand taverniers round midnight and clint eastwoods 
bird captured the essence of jazz but were so doggedly 
downbeat that they turned off average audiences 
lees mo better blues has something for everyone comedy 
sex violence drama as well as some of the most sublime jazz to 
be captured on film the rendition of the title tune will haunt us 
for years to come 
gone is the angry attitude of lees last film not that he has 
mellowed out his situations and his dialogue retain plenty of bite 
some may consider his portrayal of the two moneysqueezing 
clubowner brothers as antisemitic 
the prologue is a brief vignette of a new york boy whose mother 
wont let him go out to play until he finishes his trumpet lessons 
the boy grows up to become bleek gilliam denzel washington a 
rising jazz star whose quintet packs the beneath the underdog club 
every night 
bleek tries to balance his career with no help from his 
boyhood friend and manager giant spike lee and romances with a 
wouldbe singer cynda williams and a school teacher joie lee 
bleeks juggling act fails with tragic results 
mo better blues marks denzel washingtons continued 
emergence as a firstrank film actor he is a commanding figure on 
the bandstand and off winner of last years supporting actor 
academy award for glory and twice nominated prior to that 
hes likely to be in the running for lead actor this time 
at over two hours mo better blues could stand trimming 
especially of the bickering scenes that may be unintelligible for 
some ears but lees originality shines through in every scene and 
there is even an unexpected sweetness in the way things are 
resolved 
the film is loaded with powerful performances notably wesley 
snipes as bleeks saxplaying rival the almost continuous score by 
bill lee spikes father adds richness as does ernest dickersons

the freshman 
marlon brando is a brilliant actor but lets face it hes not 
known for making audiences laugh heavy dramatic roles are his 
forte the godfather and apocalypse now werent exactly big 
on chuckles 
thats what makes it such a delightful shock to discover in 
the freshman that brando can be funny 
in fact he is the comic heart of the freshman a film so 
hilariously crazy that its plot defies extensive description 
matthew broderick plays a new york university freshman film 
student from vermont whose misadventures in new york lead to a job 
with carmine sabatini the portly sabatini is a little italy 
businessman with an uncanny resemblance to vito corleone of the 
godfather 
this is brando doing a parody of brando and it is so finely 
crafted that it might discourage impersonators from attempting any 
future godfather imitations brando does it better than any of 
his imitators could and he never cracks a smile 
sabatini has the same husky voice the gravelinthemouth 
delivery that makes some of his words incomprehensible and the 
trademark slickeddown hair style and mustache that made corleone a 
part of american film history 
above all he has dignity that extends to a scene in which the 
bulky sabatini is seen majestically ice skating a vision that 
lasts long after the movie 
brandos plot relationship with broderick adds an undertone of 
warmth unexpected in such a broad comedy 
lest we doubt that parody is going on here brodericks 
character clark kellogg attends film classes where the teacher 
a mad professor type played by paul benedict shows film clips 
from the godfather to his enraptured students 
you know the resemblance is incredible broderick whispers 
when he is first introduced to sabatini 
the story of the freshman is pure fantasy broderick is 
commissioned to smuggle a giant lizard known as a komodo dragon 
an endangered species member out of airport customs this lizard 
actually another unendangered species is a star reptile or not 
hes endearing and when bert parks suddenly appears to sing 
there he is your komodo dragon youve got to love this movie 
the lunatic genius behind it all is writerdirector andrew 
bergman who had the inspiration to add bert parks to a movie with 
marlon brando matthew brodrerick and a giant lizard for good 
measure another film great maximilian schell shows up as a 
crazed chef with a thick german accent broderick manages to bring 
sweetness to a role that mostly requires him to look bewildered 
the freshman is an irresistible concoction with fine 
performances from all involved including the lizard but the most 
memorable moments belong to brando this is acting at its finest in 
a film that has no reason to exist except to entertain isnt that 
refreshing

he stands in a verdant patio touched by the 
dappled sunshine and glances without a hint of indecision at an 
empty canvas 
i never have any trouble with painting it just seems to burst 
out of me says tony curtis there is such a joy and an 
exuberance in it that i dont even think about what it should be or 
what it will be until i start it once in a while some object 
some arrangement of flowers some shapes some colors will intrigue 
me so i will copy them 
i do a lot of sketches and a lot of drawing but i do that to 
kind of inspire me the ultimate experience is the painting 
curtis is no sunday painter more than a hundred of his brightly 
colored canvases reminiscent of the french impressionist henri 
matisse have sold at prices ranging from 9000 to 20000 he has 
had six oneman shows 
the success comes at an opportune time in his life after an 
acting career that has known immense fame as well as depths of 
alcoholic and drug despair he seems to have found at age 65 an 
ideal existence he is often hired for character roles in features 
and tv miniseries between jobs he paints both here and in hawaii 
or on film locations 
while building a new house and studio curtis makes the belair 
hotel his base in los angeles he has a studio there but on a warm 
summer day he decided to paint in a patio with lush greenery and a 
burbling fountain he paints swiftly talking all the while 
since were outside with a lot of green i like the idea of 
doing flowers he explains i like the combination of colors 
and shapes so i think maybe im going to do a still life of some 
kind 
he begins with a piece of charcoal swiftly outlining a vase 
overflowing with flowers 
i like this time of a painting right now he muses it 
almost has a way of expressing itself it sounds a little hokey i 
know but its almost as though the painting has a life of its own 
no two paintings are alike there are similarities because 
im the guy whos doing it i like flowers the most appealing 
thing is the shapes and the combinations of the way theyre put 
together 
matisse im influenced by all the artists they are all my 
brothers or sisters when you stand before a painting by matisse or 
picasso or braque or monet you got to realize that you stand in 
exactly the same space that they stood once you know if not 
magical but theres a mystery about that space these artists are 
telling you in silent language how to express your feelings 
curtis stands back from the canvas and nods his approval of the 
pattern he immediately begins painting squeezing gobs of bright 
paint directly onto his brush no palette for him 
there was a time when i used a palette he says but i 
find this way of expressing myself with bursts of color is the most 
appealing for me i like the way the strokes of the brush are 
coming out the nice thing about working with acrylics is that it 
gives you the same feeling that oil does but you have to work much 
quicker you know its the quickness that gives it action for me 
i always do go back to paintings and finish off little areas 
that need more work but these strokes now are setting the style 
and the pace of the painting this is a brand new experience for 
me so im paying a great deal of attention to it now except for 
the bug that gets in the way 
he waves aside the insect and continues splashing the background 
with layers of deep blue to relieve the plainness of the 
background he etches a series of single lines using a special 
tool a beercan opener 
wherever i am i always use the objects that are available 
he says with a smile 
as he begins creating the flowers with brilliant hues his 
deeply tanned face becomes more intense he retains the 
handsomeness that helped make him a top star in the 1950s and 60s 
first in potboilers the prince who was a thief no room for 
the groom then in firstrate films the defiant ones 
some like it hot 
born bernard schwartz curtis received most of his education as 
a gang member in the bronx streets an acting class in a settlement 
house turned his life around and after navy service in world war 
ii he returned to new york to work in summer stock and 
offbroadway 
a talent scout brought him to universal studios where his looks 
made him a teenage idol with sweet smell of success in 1957 
he proved his worth as an actor 
his three marriages ended in divorce and produced six children 
including actress jamie lee curtis 
marital and career problems were partly responsible for his 
dependence on drugs and alcohol which he kicked in 1983 he has 
since kept busy in television fall guy and europeanmade 
films 
he has the same thick hair now a distinguished white that he 
had in his younger days and the voice still reveals his bronx 
upbringing as son of an immigrant tailor as he continues painting 
he talks openly of his personal battle 
in a way painting helps you silence yourself he says 
everything is so verbal for a few minutes you can be quiet and 
nothing is interrupting your feeling of living and the joy of it 
you know im a recovering alcoholic im seven years into my 
recovery this is a great help to me a great gift that has been 
given to me i dont know how else to say it 
it has given me such a great pleasure in life helped me 
recover which is no easy trick recovery is not only from drugs 
and alcohol and substances it is recovery from emotions hate 
anger envy avarice pain fear all of these are emotions and 
theyre all addictive 
art has long been a passion for curtis who started with 
assemblages collages and decorated boxes many years ago jan 
stussy an art professor at the university of california at los 
angeles admired his work and invited him to attend courses on the 
campus 
i absorbed it like a sponge curtis recalls i only had to 
do a lithograph once to understand the logic of it from there on 
in i was able to go off on my own 
he continues painting and talking and by the end of 40 minutes 
the picture is complete except for a few touchups here and there 
the artist stands back nods with satisfaction and begins cleaning 
his brushes amazingly his white pants and white sweater remain 
free of paint 
there it is he says it makes me feel good and i 
appreciate you letting me paint for you instead of just sitting 
around and telling you how great i was in all my movies

war and peace an opera based on tolstoys 
epic novel of five families during the russian victory over 
napoleon in 1812 is hitting a high note of musical glasnost 
even the final scene was redesigned for the 21 million 
production of sergei prokofievs rarely performed extravaganza 
tops among a series of sovietamerican performing arts ventures in 
seattle in conjunction with the goodwill games this summer 
stage director francesca zambello said initial plans called for 
the victorious gen kutuzov to arrive in a tank as soldiers and 
peasants wave red flags reflecting the soviet triumph over the 
nazis after the opera was written in 1942 
when the berlin wall came down thats when we decided were 
going to have to change this she said 
instead kutuzov walks onstage as more of a partisan a sort 
of man of the people and red army trappings have been dropped in 
favor of a broad stroke about people being freed from 
oppression she said 
with nearly three dozen singers in 69 roles an 80member 
chorus more than 100 supernumeraries and 80 musicians war and 
peace is the biggest project yet for the seattle opera which 
gained international prominence with annual performances of richard 
wagners der ring des niebelungen 
the seattle opera became a mecca for wagner fans with annual 
ring performances from 1975 to 1987 the longest run anywhere 
outside the composers old home in bayreuth germany 
its amazingly cast said soprano sheri greenawald who 
sings natasha its like francesca was saying yesterday the 
people are who they are cast 
singing opposite her as prince andrei is vladimir chernov a 
kirov opera baritone who recently signed contracts to perform and 
record next spring with the metropolitan opera in new york 
seattle has gathered together fantastic musicians and 
singers chernov said one more time it demonstrates that music 
has no nationality 
to demonstrate further chernov sang the starspangled 
banner and john patrick napoleon in the opera sang the soviet 
national anthem for about 65000 people before a fourth of july 
fireworks show 
other principals include tenor nicholai ohotnikov and basses 
alexander morozov and miroslav romanchuk all russians and us 
sopranos victoria vergara and sheila nadler mezzo soprano stella 
zambalis and tenors peter kazaras and james hoback 
bolshoi opera conductor mark ermler directed the seattle 
symphony orchestra for performances july 22 25 29 and 31 and aug 
2 and 4 plus taping sessions for highdefinition television 
the only previous operatic recording for hdtv a new technology 
offering much closer detail and greater depth of field than 
standard television was of the fourpart ring by a company this 
year in munich west germany 
john conklin designed the sets bruno schwengl of austria did 
the costumes and vasile sulich of the soviet union is the 
choreographer 
lydia venichenko barrett owner of a russian restaurant says 
war and peace has required the most work she has done for the 
opera in 22 years as a volunteer translator ranging from contract 
negotiations to shopping trips to interviews with chernov and 
ermler she was their translator for this article 
ermler who directed the bolshoi opera in war and peace at 
the met in 1975 and in a recording for the soviet label melodiya in 
1982 said he was impressed with the cast 
theyre very interesting people theyre very wellprepared 
of course there is some difficulty with the russian language 
but it will probably not be noticeable to the american audience 
he said 
greenawald a native of monticello iowa had no experience with 
russian before being cast two years ago 
before studying the libretto she learned the cyrillic alphabet 
she also read most of tolstoys novel 
i must confess i skipped a few battle scenes she said 
now greenawald says shes hooked my next goal in life is to 
sing more russian repertory she said 
chernov said he enjoyed the acoustics of the 3000seat opera 
house built for the worlds fair in 1962 at the kirov rebuilt 
after world war ii he said we have to sing very loudly and we 
dont even look good when we have to scream to the people 
zambello said artists from both countries had learned a lot from 
working together including how to work together 
whenever we do a scene we discuss everything first she 
said the russians theyre not used to that kind of practice 
theyre used to being told exactly what to do 
after asking for instruction in the early stages they 
completely turned around and participated freely in the 
giveandtake she said i have watched them open like flowers 
theyre blooming really its very exciting 
ohotnikov singing kutuzov is the only cast member with 
previous experience in war and peace he was surprised when she 
suggested he portray the czarist general as a martin luther king 
kind of character but he quickly got on the bandwagon zambello 
said 
speight jenkins general director of the seattle opera said the 
interpretive style also was different for the soviets 
were treating war and peace in period but certainly with a 
large degree of stylization he said the russians of course 
are 100 percent realistic and were not realistic at all 
then there is the russian school of singing baritones and 
basses with a very dark woody timbre the italian school zambello 
said is brighter 
with many performers singing two or three parts costume color 
coding and other devices are used in addition to projected 
supratitles to help audiences keep the huge cast of characters 
straight jenkins said 
there are 573 costumes he said i can honestly say that 
we have never put anything more beautiful on stage than this basic 
set 
rather than such signature arias as caro nome and daunting 
roles such as violeta in la traviata the work offers a very 
virile kind of romanticism that is extremely russian jenkins 
said 
it demands great singers but it is not a great vocal 
challenge he said 
where war and peace is an enormous challenge is that it is 
putting a movie on stage it is a directors opera he explained 
it demands intense musical concentration from just everybody in 
the cast it defines ensemble opera 
despite half an hour of cuts the running time is four hours 
so far as i know this is the least cut production that has 
been done in the united states jenkins said the russians 
cant believe weve kept as much as we have 
even in the soviet union prokofievs opera is rarely performed 
because of the expense ermler said 
war and peace is a tremendous financial gamble jenkins 
said its exactly like trying to put the iliad on stage 
a recent onefortwo challenge grant gives the company through 
jan 15 1991 to raise 250000 in donations to collect an 
additional 500000 from an anonymous donor a real breakthrough 
a lifesaver jenkins said 
artistic success with war and peace will prove the 
capability of the seattle opera to pull off the largest and most 
complicated operas in the repertory without compromise bailey 
said theres no doubt in my mind that audiences are going to 
walk out completely overwhelmed

the pointer sisters have always had this little 
problem they just cant stop talking at home on stage in 
interviews 
theyre wondes of nature streams of consciousness rushing like 
niagara falls just try getting through an entire sentence before 
being blown away by hurricanes ruth june and anita 
we just take over laughed june the others jabbering away 
sometimes we say the same things at the same time 
i know i can be doing something with my sisters on stage just 
doing a song and i almost want to stop sometimes and just be 
entertained says ruth 
when we were kids our father would scream my father would 
whine about it adds anita never coming up for air will you 
please just let me say something and wed just laugh hed say 
you are the craziest people ruth and june join her here ive 
ever seen in all my life 
more laughter more stories call and response 
hey ruth remember when laughter 
no june you were the one laughter 
sisters can i please ask you a question somebody help me 
this is isnt an interview its a matter of survival what can you 
do but press record and duck 
youd never know it but these are hard times for the pointer 
sisters squeezed around a small table in a manhattan hotel a 
setting more suitable for a nice quiet game of bridge 
sales have slowed considerably since automatic neutron 
dance and their other hits from the first half of the 1980s the 
last two albums have flopped and in 1988 they left their longtime 
label rca records and signed with motown 
so now theyre working extra hard blaming the slump on bad 
promotion and counting on a big push from motown for their new 
record right rhythm 
we want concerts sold out in an hour says anita 
weve grown closer to each other and our confidence has grown 
now insists june 
we have a lot of different rhythms different sounds in our 
voices ruth explains sometimes its surprising and shocking 
to me 
musically the pointers are a little bit country a little bit 
rock n roll and a whole lot of gospel and rhythm n blues jazz 
too louis armstrong can be heard from another room 
they cracked the charts in 1973 with yes we can can more 
andrews sisters than pointer sisters and three years later became 
the first black women to ever perform at the grand ole opry 
it almost ended then there were four sisters in the group at 
the time but bonnie pointer abruptly left for a solo career the 
others considered calling it quits even now they have to hold 
back the tears 
we were devastated anita recalled we werent prepared 
for it we did a show that night when she left and after that we 
did have a period where we stopped we thought this wasnt going to 
work without bonnie we all tried different things 
but they bounced back hooking up with rock producer richard 
perry in 1978 and going gold with bruce springsteens classic 
backseat ballad fire over the next five years the pointers 
just took over and won grammys in 1983 for jump and 
automatic 
right rhythm has plenty of good times man with the right 
rhythm some hard times you knocked the love right outta my 
heart and lots of wise words about life and love friends 
advice dont take it 
levi saucer jr james carmichael and marti sharron share 
production duties but this is a pointer sisters record and that 
means every song is a pointer sisters song no matters who gets the 
credit 
first of all we love some good lyrics that make some sense 
ruth said so we dont have to get an encyclopedia to figure it 
out we can work on the music a lot of times if the rhythm is 
great and the lyrics arent great sometimes we just work on the 
lyrics 
talk to the pointers about roots and that means church their 
fathers church in oakland calif where they sang as children 
thats how they sound whether joining voices in song or 
conversation gospel great dorothy love might as well have been 
telling their story when she sang these words 
some get happy they run 
other speak in an unknown dance 
some cry out in a spiritual trance 
have you ever seen the saints do the holy dance 
you know the part where were on doing im so excited 
ruth says where i introduce the band ive known these guys for 
years and id get so into having fun i forgot the drummers name 
i remembered his wifes name 
i couldnt remember his name to save my soul and i got tickled 
myself and it was all because my excitement overwhelmed me i sort 
of lost my focus and just started having fun like i was just a 
dance party somewhere and just being silly 
i think its why rampb and just regular blues music is so 
emotional june explains because its spiritual a spiritual 
feeling underneath it all when youre brought up that way the 
things that upset you maybe are probably more upsetting than 
somebody who didnt have that background

a few years ago reynolds price was in a 
bookstore and spotted the memoirs of his first editor hiram haden 
who had recently died the author immediately checked the index for 
price reynolds 
there were like 20 pages recalled price 57 whose 
acclaimed first novel a long and happy life was published in 
1962 
we hadnt seen each other for the last 10 years of his life 
but sentence by sentence everything all the fly 
right it was very fair in describing our parting of ways he 
said 
it did say one thing that completely surprised me it said 
there was something about him when he was 29 years old which 
suacts were exactggested to me that he would not have a long life he 
sort of 
felt like there was an air that i would die young 
youd never know from the picture that appears on the back cover 
of a reissue of a long and happy life showing a ruggedly 
handsome man with a closed confident smile the left arm pressed 
against a relatively batteredlooking tree the other arm extended 
down his right side 
and you wouldnt guess it now the title of his first novel 
seems protold him of his gloomy forecast price recalls a 
good thing too if he really had died young then his former 
editor might have blamed himself for not warning him in time 
raphael noren watched his life and changed his story in 
ways that kept it from closing in fear or waste he writes in 
tongues of angels price seems to have taken that path but in 
a much calmer fashion his optimism undiminished by age or illness 
his creativity shaped by a storytellers love for words and the 
spirits gift for serious laughter 
if you dont go crazy and youre not a junkie or an alcoholic 
or a sex fiend by the time youre in your late 30s youve gotten 
on top of an awful lot of problems youve learned a lot of 
skills he said 
life is learning the direct way to get from a to z without 
floundering around all over the place i think a lot of writers say 
that writing gets easier as they got older i think ideally 
speaking you should just keep getting better until youre 85

after more than a half century 
performing as a gentlemanly old man grandpa jones is sure of one 
thing hes grown into his act 
little did he know that when he was 22 an offhand remark by a 
colleague would earn him a lifelong nickname and career persona 
get up here to the mike youre just like an old grandpa 
radio entertainer bradley kincaid told him 
fiftyfour years later hes still getting in front of the mike 
and hes still everyones grandpa 
hes one of the few performers whos been on television 
virtually every week since 1968 that was the first time hee 
haw went on the air and jones has been on the country 
musichumor show ever since 
chances are hes going to be on the small screen much longer 
even if the onehour program went out of production today there 
would be more than 20 years of reruns to use 
since he was 22 jones has been on stage in a battered gray hat 
brown western boots and brightly colored suspenders a bushy 
mustache fails to conceal a mischievous grin a timeworn banjo is a 
constant companion 
they dont have to make me up too much anymore he says 
jocularly backstage at hee haw referring to his age 76 
every week on hee haw is a segment as traditional as the 
shows famous corn field cast members ask in unison hey 
grandpa whats for supper 
he responds exuberantly with a lipsmacking menu of country food 
corn bread and gravy candied yams butter beans blueberry 
cobbler the more to eat the more to spare 
not even jones recalls how the routine got started 
it seems pretty popular when i go out on personal 
appearances they holler that from the audience all the time i 
have to have an answer quick 
fellow performers on hee haw call him grandpa or pa 
off stage in fact hee haw producer sam lovullo says 
everyone on the cast says hes their favorite 
he means everything to the show hes a link to traditional 
country music we have with minnie pearl roy acuff and others hes 
made a career off rural music and rural sayings 
george goober lindsey of hee haw and the andy griffith 
show tells this story about grandpa playing in a celebrity golf 
tournament we gave him a pair of golf shoes he said theyre 
pretty good shoes if i can just get these tacks out of the bottom 
 
jones was born louis marshall jones in henderson county ky 
the youngest of 10 children he began playing mandolin and fiddle 
as a youngster and also learned to play a 75cent guitar but it 
was banjo playing that earned him recognition 
his family moved to akron ohio where in 1929 he won first 
prize in a talent contest winning 50 in 10 gold pieces 
it bought me the first good guitar i ever had jones 
recalled ive been on stage ever since 
he has performed on the grand ole opry country music show since 
1946 in 1978 he was elected to the country music hall of fame 
jones still makes up to six personal appearances a month 
playing such banjo favorites as mountin dew and old 
rattler his wife ramona a fiddler often joins him 
he has entertained at such diverse venues as carnegie hall the 
hollywood bowl various state fairs and the smithsonian institution 
he says his biggest thrill was not on hee haw or at carnegie 
hall but on a flat bed truck in rice paddies performing for 
american troops in korea 
we got within 20 yards of the front lines playing for the boys 
for four or five weeks he recalled the boys liked everything 
you did because some of them hadnt seen anyone from the states in 
nine months 
he says being on hee haw has been one of the many joys of 
his long tenure in show business 
ive had a big time its more like fun than a job theres a 
lot of good boys and gals on it weve had a lot of fun and no 
trouble he said 
its like a comic strip something is going on every few 
seconds were sort of like a family and we have good writers all 
of it together makes it a good show

just sing jackson browne has heard the 
audience taunts weary of his tireless politicking many fans have 
lost patience 
browne remains dedicated to his causes el salvador amnesty 
international and nelson mandela among them these days yet his 
current 30city concert tour is scarcely a litany of death squads 
humanrights abuses and antiapartheid slogans 
instead it is a celebration of some of plaintive ballads such 
as farther on for a dancer and before the deluge that 
first brought browne acclaim the concert series browne hopes 
will be as much of a revelation for his followers as it is for 
browne himself 
this is an acoustic tour and the song list is open to 
whatever can be played on two guitars and percussion browne said 
in an interview i can hear myself singing in a way i cant when 
i play with a band 
for a lot of people in the audience its like hearing the 
words for the first time for me its the first time since id 
written the words that id heard them the whole purpose of the 
tour is to highlight the writing 
in recent years browne has been more an activist than a 
musician now he says hes heading back toward love songs to 
succeed with a political song you have to get people to examine 
themselves he said if you preach to them youre lost

they labored 60 70 80 hours a week in schools hospitals and 
parishes turning an immigrant church into the nations largest or 
helping american catholics achieve education and income levels on a 
par with protestants 
now when their contemporaries are enjoying days of golf and 
theater and retiring in comfort to florida or arizona what earthly 
reward awaits many of the nations priests brothers and sisters 
more work 
the priest shortage has led many dioceses to set their 
retirement age at 75 while the dearth of vocations in religious 
orders has led some nuns in their 70s to go out looking for work to 
financially support their communities 
the personal issue is not to be able to retire in this 
particular culture until one is 75 is almost inhuman said 
monsignor william stanton of st ambrose church in buffalo ny 
how many people last that long 
as it is in american society the prospect of widespread 
retirement is relatively new for those who have sworn their lives 
to the church 
once a priest always a priest was the expectation of most 
priests ordained before the second vatican council in the early 
1960s said the rev david brinkmoeller executive director of the 
national conference of catholic bishops secretariat for priestly 
life and ministry 
that used to be the normal thing that people would die with 
their boots on he said 
but as the church opened itself up to american culture the 
influence of social security and other programs that gave the 
average person the expectation of a period of retirement in which 
one would enjoy life gradually filtered into the priesthood 
ironically said monsignor charles j fahey of the third age 
center at fordham university one of the motivating factors for 
offering retirement programs was a glut of priests in top positions 
that was clogging the traditional paths of advancement for younger 
priests 
it was about 1970 that the notion of the retirement of priests 
began to come into parlance fahey said at the same time the 
rest of the country was doing away with mandatory retirement we 
were putting it in 
sister jane frances power said when she entered the sisters of 
st joseph of orange in 1933 some of the younger members thought 
anybody over 50 shouldnt be teaching 
but demographic changes that once motivated dioceses to in 
faheys words get the old bucks out now have them offering 
incentives to keep priests nuns and brothers working into their 
70s and beyond 
in 1989 1 percent of catholic sisters were under 30 and 41 
percent were 70 and over of the nations 155000 men and women in 
religious orders 44000 are past 70 the lack of younger members 
bringing in income has resulted in a shortfall of retirement funds 
estimated at more than 3 billion and provided an incentive for 
older members to keep working to help out 
power who was for 30 years the chief executive officer of a 
hospital in fullerton calif signed on three years ago at age 74 
to become coordinator of health and hospitals for the archdiocese 
of los angeles 
she is not alone 
it certainly appears to us that there are a number of 
religious who are still working parttime if not fulltime into 
their 70s said sister mary oliver hudon of the triconference 
retirement project we have religious in their 60s who are 
looking for other jobs thats a new phenomenon 
sister jane e shappelle runs project encor in cincinnati a job 
service started in 1987 for women religious 50 and over and whose 
clients have included a 76yearold woman with a doctorate 
the pressure to keep working is particularly felt by priests in 
demand by a growing laity for a functions from sunday mass to 
funerals and weddings 
the number of american priests has dropped to 53000 from 59200 
in 1970 the ratio of worshipers to priests has gone from about 700 
per priest in 1955 to almost 1000 today 
pressures both overt not allowing full pensions before age 75 
and subtle such as pep talks from the bishop are exerted on 
diocesan priests to keep them in the pulpit 
we have never followed a retirement age as we have 
traditionally in civil society said the rev roland faley 
executive director of the conference of major superiors of men 
most of the people that i know would want to continue working as 
long as theyre able 
both brinkmoeller and fahey said that while there is no hard 
data dioceses seem to be pushing back retirement ages in a recent 
survey conducted by the third age center of 156 dioceses only two 
reported a mandatory retirement age of 65 twentyfour dioceses set 
their retirement age at 70 while 114 reported a mandatory 
retirement age of 75 
stanton who at 66 runs a large parish and a parochial school 
said the 75 retirement age is unreasonable 
in the diocese of buffalo more than 85 percent of 283 priests 
surveyed said they wanted a lower retirement age than the current 
one of 75 with the majority favoring a retirement age below 70 
throughout the nation fahey said there is a bit of a 
collision course between the expectancies of priests and the needs 
of the diocese 
the tension will increase fahey said with the aging of priests 
who were ordained after vatican ii and share more of the dominant 
cultural perspective that one should expect an earned leisure 
period in the final stage of life 
even with early retirement most ordained men and women likely 
would still help out in lesser roles church officials said

having hostility between two nuclear powers is a clear and 
present danger to my six grandchildren 
willens a multimillionaire who made his fortune in real estate 
said hes sunk about 400000 into the project by early july he 
said the factory was operating at 75 percent capacity turning out 
100000 pieces of clothing a month 
the clothes are all beautifully made and very affordable he 
said but he didnt have exact prices 
the plant formerly the kingisepp army base housing 6000 
soldiers is one of the first private enterprises designed to move 
the soviet union away from weapons buildup and toward economic 
independence 
joining willens in the venture are soviet actress sophia lansky 
who is project director and interpreter and entrepreneur ilya 
baskin of the garant cooperative in leningrad the base about 60 
miles southwest of leningrad officially was deeded to the 
cooperative last year 
activism has long been part of willens life 
the don quixote of the dom perignon set cofounded business 
executives move for vietnam peace in 1967 two years later he was 
national chairman for the businessmens education fund a group 
concerned about growing military spending and foreign policy 
he was an adviser to president carter and in 1978 was a member 
of the us delegation to the united nations special session on

someone who has been very active for years in arms control 
disarmament peace and bettering ussoviet relations said 
andrew korbonski professor of political science and head of uclas 
center for russian and east european studies 
on his latest project willens said hes met with some stodgy 
resistance 
on our side resistance came from experts including the rand 
corporation there was a combination of skepticism and an 
accusation of naivete a question of how can this nutty guy 
believe that this thing can be helpful 
george regas who cofounded the interfaith center to reverse 
the arms race told the los angeles times in 1982 that willens was 
the most tenacious man i have ever met 
willens was more than twice my age but has three times my 
energy regas said it stuns me hell call you at seven in the 
morning and again at 11 the same night its as if the guy never 
stops thinking about the issue 
the barrackstobaby clothesventure began in 1988 with an open 
letter in a soviet newspaper in which willens offered us 
consulting gurus free of charge to struggling russian businesses 
he got several thousand responses meetings letters and 
telephone conversations followed as he played matchmaker between 
us experts and soviet entrepreneurs 
soviet news media reported the bridging of communist and 
capitalist ideals and in the influential soviety weekly arguments 
and facts raisa gorbachev sent the americans warmest wishes 
in march 1989 the soldiers were kicked off the base and the 
capitalists moved in 
willens was 8 when his family left the soviet union in the 
aftermath of the bolshevik revolution right after high school 
willens worked as a grocery box boy 10 hours a day six days a 
week for 10 his family of four lived on that income 
these days he can relax after breakfast at the posh belair 
summit hotel 
with all thats filled his life one of the most satisfying 
aspects is his relationship with his wife he said in an interview 
at the hotel their 55th wedding anniversary is nov 30 they have 
three children 
ive been lucky enough to meet the perfect partner in my life 
my wife grace he said that fabulous type of relationship 
puts into life a flavor all too rare these days ive been lucky 
enough to be fulfilled 
mrs willens has said that teamwork has made some of her 
husbands visions reality ive always supported whatever he 
initiated therell be a discussion between us hell say you can 
be a big help to me boom boom boom and ill do it she told 
the times 
could he have done it without me i think it takes a team to 
do most anything its just too bad more married teams dont have 
this experience 
willens said hed like to be 50 again 
having learned so much it would be fun to do this again with 
the additional knowledge i had gained he said 
but he is happy to share what he knows with his grandchildren 
heather a freshman at stanford university asked his help on a 
project about the soviet union sara 15 asked for his advice with 
shakespeare 
you can see they realize grace and i have a wealth of 
experience my advice therefore is for them to do what theyre now 
doing remembering that their grandparents love them immensely 
willens said 
its sheer ecstasy that they can turn to our experience 
and what does he think of his status as one of the notsoyoung 
antinukesters 
im a good example of what a person can do ive done well 
now ill do good im a citizen as opposed to a resident a 
citizen of course is someone who cares about the country

diets and retirement are anathema to 
simone beck master cook and teacher coauthor with julia child of 
mastering the art of french cooking 
with her 86th birthday just past shes looking forward to 
publication of her fifth book next spring it will be an intimate 
autobiography as well as a cookbook 
cooking cant keep you young but it can surely help keep 
fit said beck sitting on the sunny terrace of her provencal 
farmhouse between cannes and grasse crash diets can do you 
little but harm 
it has been 32 years since beck child and louisette bertholle 
published what became the first volume of mastering the art 
the bible of french cuisine for americans yearning to learn the 
secrets of sauces like bechamel bordelaise or hollandaise 
a second volume by beck and child followed with equal success 
while bertholle branched off to write her own cookbooks 
eventually all three were doing their own thing 
after mastering the art beck wrote simcas cuisine in 
1972 her friends call her simca and new recipes in 1979 
although a celebrity in american culinary circles and mentor to 
a couple of generations of american cooks beck is relatively 
unknown in france 
i hope my main statement in life my memoirs and new recipes 
will take off when published by viking next spring said beck 
it doesnt have a title yet but it tells all she said with 
a wink including a bit about my love life also my tricks in 
cooking well known to my pupils but i have new ones up the old 
sleeve 
her new book was inspired by childs encouragement beck said 
when becks husband jean fischbacher died in 1986 child and 
her husband paul who have owned a house on becks property since 
the 1960s came over to give moral support 
child was fascinated by becks life particularly some 
hairraising adventures during world war ii and persuaded her to 
write it down 
its all in the book including how i met julia at a cocktail 
party when i was looking for an american collaborator for a book of 
french recipes beck said 
mastering was an epic effort a labor of love 10 years in 
which beck bertholle and child hashed over french techniques for a 
transatlantic audience 
writing her life story was another challenge it recalls her 
privileged childhood in normandy two marriages and her 
professional life weaving traditional and new menus and recipes 
into the narrative 
id learned food basics in normandy with the family cook 
zulma beck said but when i was a young bride in paris i took 
up bookbinding 
she won a prize and looked around for something more 
interesting after she stumbled onto the cordon bleu school while 
driving around paris in the 1930s she lured the top teacher henri 
pellaprat home to help her prepare fancy dinner parties jotting 
down his tips but she didnt start teaching herself until well 
after world war ii 
during the war id spent much of the time bicycling around 
normandy bargaining with farmers to get food to send to my second 
husband who was in a german prison camp she said 
after the war beck became involved in cooking and teaching at 
lecole des trois gourmandes founded by the coauthors of 
mastering 
later beck taught cooking on her own giving lessons in her 
paris flat at her guest house in southern france and on world 
demonstration tours 
today she teaches less but likes to philosophize on food 
dont talk to me about nouvelle cuisine she said it made 
food attractivelooking for anorexics but thats about all and i 
never could stand eating raw fish an abomination 
and she appreciates her audience in the united states 
i always preferred to write for americans beck said 
french people think they already know everything about cooking

that americans are aging should have 
marketers racing to attract a huge maturing generation but theyre 
slow to catch on an author said 
youve got young creators and theyre working from their own 
value systems said david wolfe who wrote serving the ageless 
market strategies for selling to the fiftyplus market 
they have a sympathetic understanding of older people but not 
an empathetic understanding he said 
he cited buick as a company trying to attract an older market 
with its 1991 park avenue showcased recently in nashville at the 
national association for senior living industries exposition 
seniors gave the cars flat plush seats a thumbsup over bucket 
seats and the car also features safety features such as air bags 
and has easytouse door handles 
john dabels general director of divisional marketing for buick 
said the car was redesigned after testmarketing showed older 
consumers wanted different accessories 
one complaint was i dont want a cockpit i want an 
easytoread instrument panel dabels said 
so the company designed a panel that wraps around to the 
drivers door and has larger more easily distinguishable control 
buttons 
senior citizens want to buy an experience not a product 
dabels said 
wolfe agreed the gateway to experience is the no 1 principle 
of marketing to older people they do not buy products for 
services they buy the consequential experience that purchase will 
make possible 
wolfe who founded the national association for senior living 
industries five years ago said marketers are having a difficult 
time with that idea 
this is whats driving marketers nuts he said older 
people dont buy in such a way that they can be arranged in 
groups 
wolfe said the infiniti car advertisements which never showed 
the product had the right idea in showing the experience but they 
didnt follow through and grab the consumer 
on the other hand the mcdonalds commercial that featured an 
older man returning to the restaurant for a job he held as a young 
man unexpectedly increased patronage by older people 
they understand us was the reaction of older consumers who 
were actually being targeted to work for the fast food company 
wolfe said 
the median age in this country is 33 by the end of the decade 
it will be 39 wolfe said 
what we have is an aging society that is moving toward 
agelessness it is a worldwide movement we need to understand it 
to better be able to capitalize on it he said 
the term agelessness means that as a person grows older age 
loses significance in terms of influencing behavior wolfe said 
and what were concerned with in marketing is human 
behavior he said it is the stages of life that we really 
need to focus on not the ages of life

the scene is common older people sitting in 
their equityrich homes struggling to pay the monthly bills for 
many a reverse mortgage also known as a home equity conversion 
may provide relief 
generally reverse mortgages are available to individuals 62 or 
older who owe nothing or very little on their homes 
a homeowner entering into a reverse mortgage receives monthly 
payments from the lender based on several factors including the 
type of mortgage selected age and life expectancy the value of 
the house the predicted value of the house at the end of the loan 
the interest rate and the amount of equity available 
upon death or sale of the home the loan is repaid currently 
there are three basic options from which to choose when selecting a 
reverse mortgage term tenure or line of credit 
under the conditions of a term loan borrowers receive monthly 
payments for a fixed number of years although the loan does not 
have to be repaid until the house is sold or the borrower dies 
interest accrues on the amount received 
since term loans expire after a stated number of years the 
monthly payments received by the borrower usually are larger 
compared with the other options 
term loans generally are best for those who actually plan to 
move at the end of the term thus avoiding additional interest 
charges 
borrowers who choose a tenure mortgage receive monthly payments 
for as long as they live in the home and like a term loan 
repayment is not due until the borrower dies or the house is sold 
however since the exact duration of the loan cannot be determined 
payments normally are less than those paid under a term loan 
agreement 
a line of credit loan allows an individual to borrow against a 
line of credit as needed the lumpsum amount available is based 
on the aforementioned factors and once again need not be rapaid 
until the borrower dies or the house is sold 
in conjunction with any of these loan alternatives borrowers 
may pledge all or a portion of the appreciation on the house to a 
lender increasing the amount of the monthly payments or the line 
of credit 
upon death or sale of the house the borrower or the borrowers 
estate will be responsible for the repayment of the principal 
interest and the agreed upon portion of appreciation 
as with any financing arrangement there are advantages and 
disadvantages associated with a reverse mortgage since a reverse 
mortgage is nothing more than a loan the proceeds are received 
taxfree 
the loans usually are nonrecourse meaning the borrower never 
will be liable for more than the value of the house the biggest 
advantage though for many borrowers is the ability to continue 
living in a house and neighborhood that have become familiar while 
at the same time using the house to increase the quality of life or 
peace of mind 
as for the downside many people do not want to deplete what 
generally is their single most important asset they have worked 
long and hard to pay off the mortgage and collect the deed from the 
bank 
they also may want or feel it is their duty to leave the house 
to their heirs moreover a premature sale of a house due to 
unforeseen circumstances by individuals involved in a shared 
appreciation reverse mortgage may cause them to end up both house 
poor and cash poor borrowers still are liable for property tax and 
insurance costs associated with the house 
lastly because most reverse mortgages are nonrecourse loans 
lenders are reluctant to offer them in response to this 
reluctance however the federal housing administration is 
sponsoring a pilot program that if successful could lead to more 
lenders willing to offer reverse mortgages

sally helgesen has some advice for the women 
of corporate america be yourselves 
in a new book that follows four top female executives through 
their workday helgesen argues that women shouldnt scrap the 
values they were raised with to try and think and act like men in 
the workplace 
for more than a decade thousands of aspiring women executives 
in tailored pinstripes and floppy bowties have been told they need 
to act more like men in the corporate jungle 
so they took up golf learned to like or at least understand 
football and surpressed their emotions and just like their male 
counterparts they have sacrificed their personal lives 
instead they should focus on the values that women recognize 
as a source of their strength values that for too long have been 
dismissed as signs of weakness helgesen states in the female 
advantage womens ways of leadership 
those values include listening teaching favoring cooperation 
with colleagues over competition encouraging subordinates rather 
than dominating them 
at a time when a fortune magazine cover story wonders why 
women still arent getting to the top helgesens book looks at 
womens skills talents and values as a plus that can add to 
companies and organizations she said during a recent interview 
in washington 
the book takes a close look at the work day of four women the 
national executive director of the girl scouts of the united states 
of america in new york the president of a denver colobased 
industrial contracting company the chief of ford motor cos 
executive development center in detroit and the head of a 
baltimorebased broadcasting company that owns three radio stations 
influenced by a 1973 landmark study by organization expert henry 
mintzberg who followed five male executives through their day 
helgesen observed the work habits of four women who already hold 
senior positions writing down everything that happened to them 
from opening mail in the morning to meetings and phone calls into 
the evening 
in contrast to the traditional corporate leaders men of 
vision who impose that vision from the top down helgesens four 
women have found what she terms a distinctive voice for 
stressing empowerment and human development rather than 
subordination to the chain of command 
these women make time in their schedules to reflect read or 
simply rest they make time for their families and expect their 
staff to do likewise they encourage creativity and downplay 
hierarchy through structures that resemble a circle or web rather 
than a pyramid said helgesen 
they also pay attention to details and see the morning mail as 
an opportunity to connect with clients and colleagues not a 
distraction two even have inhouse rules that all correspondence 
must be answered within three days 
one of the executives fords nancy badore told helgesen that 
most women dont realize that theyre good at their jobs until 
about five or ten years after men do 
what i would like the female advantage to do is cut that 
time from 10 years to two then id really feel like i made a 
contribution said helgesen 
but she said the book is not meant as an attack on the way men 
manage 
one of the things i believe is that women have benefitted 
tremendously over the last 20 years by really studying how men do 
things said helgesen 42 a freelance writer living in new 
yorks greenwich village who was drawn to business topics after 
writing a book about texas oilmen 
weve been reading books about strategic thinking and 
assertiveness training and learning all these skills that a lot of 
us were not really raised to have she said 
but the oldfashioned male dominated poweroriented corporate 
hierarchy is on its way out she believes forced to change by 
global competition changing technology and an everincreasing 
female workforce 
in its place kinder gentler corporate structures are evolving 
where innovation is encouraged and winning the corner office at all 
costs is not as important as being a wellrounded person who is 
fulfilled on and off the job 
as an example of this helgesen points to john f welch jr 
president of general electric co who goes home at 6 pm every 
night and encourages his staff to follow his example 
part of what he has said is important to ge is people who are 
able to spend time with their families and be rounded whole 
people and when you get someone like the president of ge talking 
like that you know youve got tremendous change in values she 
said

media spending will grow at a 76 percent yearly 
rate to 4613 billion by 1994 exceeding growth in the economy but 
slowing from its 89 percent pace of the past five years according 
to a new study 
the report from the investment banking firm veronis suhler amp 
associates which specializes in media deals covers spending on 
media ranging from radio and tv to newspapers books magazines 
music and the movies 
in its fourth annual industry forecast released sunday the firm 
said communications industry spending would grow faster than the 
economy from 199094 
the firm expects the economy to grow 72 percent including 
inflation for each of the next five years up from 69 percent in 
the past five 
but it said communications spending will expand more slowly in 
the next five years than in the past five because of maturation 
of the technologydriven industries of the 1980s such as home 
video cable tv compact disc recordings and business information 
broadcasting spending is expected to grow at a 71 percent 
compounded annual rate to 462 billion by 1994 up from 58 
percent for 198489

year from 75 percent in each of the past five years the report

339 billion in 1994 up from 58 percent annual growth in the 
past five years 
spending growth in radio will rise to 80 percent a year to 
123 billion by 1994 the report said it had grown at a 76 
percent rate in the past five years 
the forecast for cable tv called for an 8 percent annual growth 
rate to 195 billion in 1994 down from more heady 12 percent 
annual growth in the past five years 
newspaper spending is expected to rise at a 67 percent annual 
rate over the next five years up from 63 percent a year in the 
past five and reach 618 billion in 1994 annual growth at weekly 
newspapers is expected to outpace growth at dailies 79 percent to 
66 percent 
the report said growth in magazine spending will hold steady at 
72 percent annual rate in the next five years the same as the 
past five and reach 241 billion in 1994 
growth at consumer magazines will slow to 75 percent a year 
from 80 percent the report said while growth at business 
magazines is expected to accelerate to 57 percent from 39 percent 
the report offered these estimates of annual spending growth in 
other communications industry segments for the next five years 
82 percent for filmed entertainment down from 170 percent 
annual growth in the past five years and reaching 352 billion in 
1994

against a backdrop of iraqi threats to 
punish cheaters opec ministers meet this week to work out a 
strategy for restraining output and pushing up oil prices 
the atmosphere will be very heavy said pierre terzian 
editor of the oil publication petrostrategies based in paris 
paul mlotok head of energy research at the morgan stanley 
investment firm in new york said there is definitely concern 
within opec about this turn of events with iraq making threats 
on thursday oil ministers of the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries open their midyear conference to set 
price and production guidlines an eightmember monitoring panel 
convenes a day earlier 
a brief meeting had been anticipated until president saddam 
hussein of iraq threatened last week to use force if necessary 
against arab countries that surpassed their opec production quotas 
and caused prices to drop 
he claimed lower prices had cost his country 14 billion in the 
last year 
saddam did not mention names but he clearly meant kuwait and 
the united arab emirates which have violated their quotas 
regularly 
a week before saddam complained analysts said saudi arabia and 
four other persian gulf producers proposed an arrangement under 
which kuwait and the united arab emirates would reduce production 
to 15 million barrels a day each they had been pumping up to 2 
million barrels a day 
analysts say the cartel probably will settle on an overall 
ceiling of about 225 million barrels a day not far from 221 
million for the first half of the year 
the international energy agency estimated opec production in 
june at 232 million barrels a day off 400000 from may and down 
nearly 700000 barrels from april 
opec ministers are considered likely to hold their price target 
steady at 18 a 42gallon barrel but iran and iraq are expected to 
press for a higher goal gholamreza aqazadeh irans oil minister 
expressed hope last week that the cartel would lift its target to 
20 
its possible that as a sop to iran and iraq they will adopt 
20 immediately said lucy mullins analyst at the london firm of 
barclays de zoete wedd 
the opec meeting comes a week after the american petroleum 
institute in washington reported a higher us dependence on 
foreign oil the api said the us imported 499 percent of its oil 
in the first half of 1990 the highest percentage since records 
began in 1947 
the august contract for the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
west texas intermediate rose 62 cents friday to 1961 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange it had risen 44 cents a barrel 
thursday 
sadek boussena the algerian minister and acting president of 
opec urged unity and discipline among members the cartels 
news agency quoted him as saying it is in the interest of 
everybody to cooperate in order to stabilize oil prices and enhance 
our revenue 
if opec is able to reduce production even slightly analysts 
predict prices will rise 
terzian of petrostrategies believes kuwait and the united arab 
emirates have begun reducing output and mlotok of morgan stanley 
said i would expect even with a little bit of leakage as long 
as opec stays under 23 million barrels a day prices would rise 
prices have climbed recently partly on the possibility of opec 
production cuts traders also were nervous about iraqi 
saberrattling since the gulf region contains about twothirds of 
the worlds proven oil reserves 
on the new york mercantile exchange the august contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark american crude closed at 
1961 last week 
in the spring oil prices plunged far below opecs target of 
18 reaching 1364 in june then gained about 1 in july the 
price had been 2046 in late january 
analysts attributed the spring decline to excess production and 
weak demand by consuming nations the oil held an emergency meeting 
in early may to seek ways of halting the slide 
they pledged production cuts of 1445 million barrels a day to 
get closer to the ceiling of 221 million barrels

the nations beekeepers have launched a logo 
campaign they hope will make life sweeter for consumers while 
stinging manufacturers who use only token amounts of honey 
last august the national honey board launched the bear 
facts campaign to authorize manufacturers to use its logo a 
cuddly bear guzzling honey from a jug on products that have honey 
as the primary sweetener 
mary humann acting executive director of the board said the 
campaign has a twofold purpose to help consumers identify 
honeysweetened products quickly by looking for the bear symbol and 
to target products that use the word honey but only contain a 
minute amount or a honey substitute 
each product is tested by a panel of food scientists to make 
sure the boards criteria are met before the logos use is allowed 
more than 55 products from wine to bird food have added the 
logo to their packaging humann said 
we felt that it was a strong addition to our label honey has 
a strong sweetener quality with a lot more positive impact said 
patrick ferrill a spokesman for ralston purina which makes honey 
chex cereal 
the campaign comes at a time when the us food and drug 
administration is researching proposed sweeping changes in food 
labeling one plan would require percentage listings for each 
ingredient which would give consumers a better idea of exactly 
what theyre buying said chris lecos fda press officer in 
washington dc 
stuart greenblatt a spokesman for keebler co in elmhurst 
ill said the honey board campaign is one of several that have 
cropped up recently in the food industry 
everybody is looking for something extra some added value 
he said 
keebler has five products including honey grahams that use 
honey as flavoring but not as the primary sweetener he said 
honey grahams which has been on the grocery store shelves for more 
than a dozen years was named after honey primarily to promote its 
flavor 
gary evans president of sioux honey association in sioux city 
iowa which makes sue bee honey products said apiarists are 
worried by the trend toward capitalizing on honeys reputation 
without using substantial amounts of the sweet gooey substance 
thats why with the national honey boards help we can kind 
of police the industry he said honey is getting to be very 
popular i think some of them are taking advantage of the word 
honey 
ferrill said he didnt know if the logo had gained recognition 
among consumers yet but we hope itll improve the competitive 
edge of our product and thats why we go to the trouble of putting 
it on our product 
the national honey board was authorized by congress and 
established by the agriculture department in 1986 to promote honey 
and honey research beekeepers pay 1 cent per pound of honey to 
fund the board

the bush administration is running out of cash 
for savings and loan bailouts with the job less than half finished 
the administration panel that oversees the bailout the 
resolution trust corp has gained widespread praise for stepping 
up its activities but just as it is hitting its stride a cash 
crunch threatens to slow progress to a limp 
analysts fear that a slowdown in the cleanup could just make the 
sampl mess worse allowing struggling sampls to continue to pile up 
losses 
the bulk of the sampl cleanup lies ahead some 250 failed 
institutions remain in government control and at least another 250 
failures are expected 
but peter monroe president of the administration panel 
controlling the rtcs policy and financing said the agency will 
have only 7 billion in borrowing authority left after sept 30 
that plus the proceeds from any sampl asset sales it manages 
will be all thats available to spend unless congress comes to the 
rescue 
congress authorized 50 billion last august and may have to come 
up with another 50 billion for fiscal year 1991 beginning oct 1 
the issue is at the center of budget negotiations between the white 
house and congressional leaders 
nobody should conclude that the major portion of the problem 
has been dealt with it hasnt economist james barth of auburn 
university said 
the rtc announced ambitious plans last week to close or sell 77 
failed thrifts in the julyseptember quarter including some of the 
largest now in government hands 
among them city savings bank bedminster nj empire of 
america buffalo ny and merabank phoenix ariz 
that will follow operation clean sweep during which 155 
institutions were closed or sold from april through june 
in the roughly 210 institutions dealt with so far the trust 
corporation has had to keep about half of the institutions assets 
it will take a major sales job to unload the sour loans real 
estate and junk bonds now in the governments hands 
most of the assets have been put on the books of the rtc not 
disposed of and there are hundreds more institutions they have 
to deal with barth said 
electionyear politics is complicating the administrations 
effort to get the money needed to finish the job it was difficult 
for many legislators to vote for 50 billion for the bailout last 
august with midterm congressional elections more than a year away 
now with the sampl mess the focus of many congressional races 
more lawmakers will find it impossible to at least in the publics 
perception throw good money after bad 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
fears congress may wait until a lame duck session after the 
election to approve a budget deal delaying new sampl money until 
december 
we could get into a stopstart mode and that would be really 
unfortunate he said we have picked up the pace but we need 
to maintain that pace for at least two years if the administration 
is to declare by the summer of 1992 that it has cleaned up the 
mess 
economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions a trade group said regulators may be tempted to use 
a recently announced shift in bailout strategy finding acquirers 
for failed thrifts before they are seized as an excuse to leave 
insolvent thrifts open 
that he said would be a return to the bad old days when the 
federal home loan bank board left hundreds of failed thrifts open 
and piling up losses because the board didnt have the money to 
shut them down 
were hearing now that the way to deal with institutions is to 
somehow prop them up until bidders come along regalia said 
but thats not good for taxpayers and thats not good for healthy 
thrifts i think the quicker we address this problem the 
better off everyone is

most manufacturers contacted in a survey say 
improving their work force is most important for enhancing 
productivity but many continue to put their money elsewhere 
in the survey by the accounting and consulting firm grant 
thornton 69 percent of the 250 manufacturing companies cited 
productivity as a problem about 12 percent called productivity a 
major concern 
for 54 percent of those admitting to a productivity lag 
managers said people are the problem yet nearly four out of 10 
manufacturers surveyed or 38 percent cited investment in new 
plant or equipment as the single most important step their 
companies have taken in the past three years to increase 
productivity 
in contrast only 24 percent said investing in their workers was 
their no 1 answer to the productivity problem only 6 percent 
mentioned pay incentives as a way to increase worker output 
while most manufacturers already have incentive plans many of 
these programs offer room for improvement particularly as they 
affect production workers said michael n cantwell chairman of 
grant thorntons national manufacturing industry committee 
the telephone survey of midsized manufacturers was conducted 
for grant thornton in february the margin of error was plus or 
minus 6 percentage points it said

the united auto workers union and the nations 
big three automakers have given few clues about how labor 
negotiations will progress during the next eight weeks 
the uaw opened talks with general motors corp on wednesday 
with ford motor co on thursday and with chrysler corp on friday 
the contracts expire sept 14 
there were no surprises in the three opening days of bargaining 
and there arent likely to be any in the next few weeks beginning 
today negotiating committees break up into subcommittees focusing 
on specific areas including job security overtime and healthcare 
benefits and costs 
at news conferences after the opening day of talks at each of 
the automakers union and management officials spoke mostly about 
general concepts except for chrysler chief negotiator anthony st 
john 
chrysler the company which could be hurt the most in this round 
of talks said it proposed setting up a multiemployer healthcare 
trust like the other automakers chrysler has said it will be 
seeking relief from the soaring costs of health care for its active 
and retired employees 
but unlike the others so far in the talks chrysler outlined a 
method designed to do that and chrysler isnt limiting membership 
in the plan to the automakers 
st john said chrysler would consider hooking up with all sorts 
of industries in the health plan with a larger group the plan 
would have more clout with insurers and costs could be driven down 
he also said formation of such a trust would get around a change 
in accounting rules in 1993 st john said the change which would 
require employers to set aside money in benefit programs instead of 
paying as they go could add 7 an hour to its labor costs 
so far gm and ford have been cool to the idea 
chrysler and wall street analysts said chryslers secondquarter 
earnings should be about half of last years 341 million the 
company is expected to lose a considerable amount of money in the 
third quarter when two of its most profitable plants close for 
retooling 
shrinking profits car and truck sales running 13 percent behind 
last years pace at the end of last month and the companys 
healthcare costs which ran at a 684 million annual rate last 
year spell financial trouble for chrysler 
gm says it spent about 3 billion last year in healthcare costs 
and ford said it shelled out about 781 million last year 
the union has acknowledged that healthcare costs are huge it 
has used that as a lever in its efforts to pry loose support for a 
move to a national healthcare plan 
for that the union and its supporters must negotiate with 
congress for now the uaws focus is at the three automakers 
the union is bargaining for somewhere around half a million 
active and laid off employees nearly that many retirees also are 
counting on the union to secure a boost to their pensions which 
they say have been chewed up by inflation 
in the past uaw contracts have set the model for other heavy 
industries in the united states but thats changed union 
membership in the united states generally has declined the uaw 
has shrunk by about a third to a million members and japanese 
competition has increased in nearly all manufacturing especially 
in the steel and auto industries 
there has been speculation that chrysler will bolt from the 
tradition the uaw has used of focusing on one company late in the 
bargaining and using that contract as a pattern for the other two 
but bieber said friday he doesnt intend to let that happen 
this round of bargaining is on pattern and thats where it 
will stay he said friday

monsanto co said monday it had a 2 percent 
rise in its profit for the second quarter because of a 31 million 
onetime gain from the sale of some assets in a japanese joint 
venture 
without the gain its profit would have fallen 11 percent 
for the quarter which ended june 30 the chemical giant had net 
earnings of 247 million or 190 a share up from 241 million 
or 177 a share for the same period a year earlier earnings per 
share figures were adjusted for a twoforone stock split in may 
sales in the second quarter of 236 billion were up 1 percent 
compared with 234 billion for the same period a year ago 
the 31 million gain came from the reorganization of monsantos 
joint venture with mitsubishi kasei corp in which monsanto and 
mitsubishi each retained certain products while a new joint venture 
was formed to sell other products 
richard mahoney monsantos chairman and chief executive 
officer said extreme weather conditions around the world hurt the 
companys second biggest division agricultural products 
he said sales of herbicides such as roundup and lasso dropped 
off in several major markets because it was either too wet to plant 
or too dry for weed growth 
the weather is always a factor in our agricultural business 
but no year in memory has produced such difficult conditions for 
our herbicides mahoney said 
the company also had lower profits in its chemicals unit the 
companys largest division because of the continuing slump in the 
us auto industry along with difficult economic conditions in 
brazil and argentina 
for the first six months monsanto had a profit of 441 million 
337 a share down 5 percent from the 463 million or 339 a 
share earned during the first half of 1989 
sales for the first half were 465 billion up 1 percent from 
461 billion in the first half of 1989

trade 
an early plunge in the stock market of more than 100 points in

favorable crop weather also weighed heavily on the corn and 
soybean markets a weekly agriculture department report due out 
this afternoon was expected to show continued improvement in crop 
conditions

minnesota mining and manufacturing co 
said monday its profit rose 47 percent in the second quarter as 
its sales climbed 69 percent 
the diversified manufacturing company also known as 3m said it 
earned 342 million or 154 per share in the three months ended 
june 30 compared with 327 million or 149 per share a year 
earlier 
sales in the second quarter rose to 3234 billion from 3025 
billion in 1989 
for the first six months net income rose 50 percent to 677 
million or 305 a share compared with 645 million or 292 a 
share in the first half of last year 
sales for the first six months increased 59 percent to 6398 
billion from 6042 billion in the yearago period 
secondquarter results benefited from a pickup in our us 
unitvolume growth and from continued productivityimprovement 
efforts said allen f jacobson chairman and chief executive 
officer 
the companys domestic unit volume increased about 3 percent for 
the quarter including strong growth in life sciences and solid 
gains in the health care and traffic and personal safety businesses 
3m also reported sizable volume gains in its industrial and 
electronic segment its largest which includes telecommunications 
systems electronic products and specialty chemicals jacobson said 
outside the united states 3m achieved doubledigit unit growth 
for the 10th consecutive quarter he said although international 
profits declined slightly from the second quarter last year 
this reflected the impact of economic changes in brazil 
negative currency effects and investments in new businesses 
jacobson said 
the company estimates that the brazilian situation reduced 
secondquarter earnings by approximately 3 cents a share in 
addition currency effects reduced earnings by about 1 cent a 
share jacobson said 
jacobson said he expects higher sales and earnings for 3m in the 
second half 
we look for slightly stronger growth in the us economy in 
the second half jacobson said this coupled with ongoing 
productivityimprovement efforts should help us results for the 
balance of the year 
in addition our international profits will benefit from 
continued solid volume growth as well as from recent weakening of 
the us dollar and improvement in our brazilian business he 
said

according to a widelywatched index released monday 
the oil toolmaker baker hughes inc reported this weeks 
increase reversed a series of declines including a drop of 10 rigs

at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
among major oilproducing states oklahoma posted the largest 
increase with 11 wyomings count was up six colorado was up by 
five and michigan was up one 
texas pennsylvania and ohio each gained three rigs

grehyound dial corp posted secondquarter 
earnings of 392 million on continuing operations up from 356 
million last year but suffered an overall loss of 601 million 
due to the bankruptcy of the bus line it sold in 1987 the company 
reported monday 
secondquarter revenues were 9123 million down from 9255 
million in the same quarter last year the company said income per 
share from continuing operations was 97 cents up from 92 cents 
overall however the company sustained a net loss of 154 per 
share for the quarter 
john w teets chairman president and chief executive officer 
attributed the loss to a onetime 100 million loss provision for 
the bankruptcy of greyhound bus lines 
greyhound dial sold the bus line in 1987 but retained a 225 
percent stake in the companys parent gli holding and also has 
other greyhound bus lines holdings 
greyhound bus lines sought protection from creditors in us 
bankruptcy court in june the action followed a march strike by bus 
line workers 
teets said greyhound dials consumerproducts division had a 
strong quarter with operating income up 22 percent paced by its 
dial bar soap and liquid dial antibacterial soap 
greyhound dials services segment meanwhile recorded an 18 
percent increase in operating income led by greyhound exposition 
services and dobbs companies operations teets said travelers 
express a leading issuer of money orders and premier cruise 
lines also posted strong secondquarter performances he said 
the transportation manufacturing division reported a sharp 
decline in earnings and operating income however due to problems 
with a major transit order and uncertainties in intercity coach 
sales resulting from the greyhound bus lines strike and bankruptcy 
teets said 
the financial group on the other hand reported a 13 percent 
improvement in net income he said 
overall he said the outlook for the company remains positive 
the operating results of the second quarter coupled with an 
excellent first quarter indicates the company is on target with 
its plans and objectives teets said this performance builds 
on the fine results recorded in both 1988 and 1989 and demonstrated 
that the company is in a strong position to continue its steady 
growth 
for the first six months of the year greyhound dial reported 
revenues of 18 billion up from 177 billion for the first half 
of 1989 income from continuing operations was 56 million 
compared to 504 million for the same period last year 
however the company reported a net loss of 439 million for 
the first half of this year

million or 80 cents per share in 1989 sales were up slightly

our company said tom stephens chairman chief executive officer 
and president of the denverbased building products company 
constructionrelated markets continued to erode slowly and 
while demand for our coated paperboard products was strong 
packaging sales were down he said 
in brazil our domestic markets continue to be negatively 
affected by the countrys new economic program but our exports 
from brazil remain on targe stephens said we remain confident 
about manvilles longterm prospects in brazil and continue to 
strengthen our position in worldwide paper markets 
stephens said the competitive pressures in all of the companys 
product lines are expected to intensify during the second half of 
1990 
while manville deals primarily in building products it also 
makes fiberglass and industrial insulation products paper and wood 
products packaging roofing and filtration systems and is involved 
in mining 
manville which employs more than 18000 people at 50 plants and 
four mines worldwide filed for chapter 11 reorganization in 1982 
as it faced billions of dollars worth of lawsuits stemming from the 
companys previous asbestosrelated business operations the 
company emerged from chapter 11 protection in 1988 with a plan to 
repay creditors and people claiming personal injury or property 
damage from asbestos

the united states and the european community on 
monday postponed a showdown over agricultural subsidies as senior 
negotiators launched a new bid to speed the progress of talks aimed 
at a more open global economy 
but officials from washington and brussels made it clear that 
with less than five months remaining in the talks there are still 
vast differences over farm policy 
us deputy trade representative julius katz said the united 
states would continue pressing for elimination of tradedistorting 
export subsidies 
but guy legras senior ec negotiator on agriculture indicated 
the 12nation trading bloc would stand by its defense of export 
assistance to help european farmers compete in world markets 
agriculture is the most contentious of the 15 sectors covered by 
the negotiations sponsored by the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade the talks were launched in uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled 
to end in december with accords to reduce barriers to trade and 
expand rules into new areas worth an estimated 1 trillion 
negotiators from 105 countries in the talks are in geneva for 
the fiveday meeting of the gatts toplevel trade negotiations 
committee to push the ambitious talks and identify the sticking 
points 
arthur dunkel directorgeneral of gatt higlighted textiles and 
services such as banking and aviation as two areas of impasse 
dunkel told a news conference that governments were playing 
cat and mouse in the negotiations by making progress in one 
sector conditional on their demands being met in another area 
but he said there was a possible opening in talks on agriculture 
reform 
this was after an agricultural working group meeting agreed to 
use a compromise proposal on farm policy as to intensify the 
negotiations as agreed by world leaders at the houston economic 
summit earlier this month 
a statement issued by the groups chairman aart de zeeuw said 
negotiations on substantive work would start at the end of august 
the decision averts a crisis at the geneva meeting but merely 
delays the inevitable clash 
the compromise text by de zeeuw focuses on cutting domestic farm 
payments and price supports and converting all import barriers 
into tariffs which will be reduced 
it is toughest on export subsidies and states these should be 
reduced more than other forms of support and protection 
legras said the ecs still was strongly opposed to the proposals 
on export subsidies the ec commission agress there should be 
tightening of export aids but refuses to take firm steps to reduce 
them 
katz insisted subsidy cuts must be a central part of any deal on 
farm policy 
it is not sufficient to have treatment of export subsidies as 
a residual issue the conclusion of the negotiations has to deal 
with export subsidies with specific commitments he said 
current state assistance to farmers costs consumers and 
taxpayers an estimated 245 billion annually 
us president george bush has warned that failure to reach a 
satisfactory agreement on slashing farm supports will cause the 
collapse of the entire uruguay round risking further trade wars 
and protectionism 
the removal of agriculture from the agenda at the tnc meeting 
leaves the 450 negotiators free to concentrate on other problem 
areas 
these include trade in textiles worth some 177 billion in 
1988 trade is currently regulated by the multifiber arrangement 
mfa and not by gatt under this system import quotas are fixed in 
bilateral deals 
washington wants to abolish the mfa and replace it with a global 
quota system with quotas negotiated on a multilateral basis and 
increased over a tenyear period critics say a completely new 
system would enable washington to slip in new restrictions 
there also is stalemate in efforts to set up a general agreement 
on services to help liberalize services trade worth at least 600 
billion annually 
most countries favor an accord covering all sectors but the 
united states wants a narrower framework which would allow it to 
continue bilateral deals which benefit the us aviation and 
shipping industry and offer some control over financial services

some of the sharp differences between prices in 
japan and other countries have vanished although more competition 
and deregulation are needed to narrow the gap further a government 
report said monday 
the economic planning agencys report on prices also offered 
little hope for change in the amounts japanese pay for utilities 
such as gas and electricity 
those charges were from 10 percent to more than 100 percent 
higher than the prices paid by consumers in the united states and 
western european countries 
the report said the weakening of the yen in foreign exchange 
during the past year and lower yen prices in japan had erased the 
price differential between japan and its western trading partners 
in international air fares international telephone calls and 
exported japanese manufactured goods 
thats good news for foreign companies that complain about 
communications prices inflating the cost of doing business in 
japan however they get no relief in japanese rents and land 
prices which are the worlds highest 
for japanese consumers relief is yet to come in the prices of 
imported goods many foods energy and other areas although they 
do not have to worry about inflation sending prices even higher 
the rise in the consumer price index has been 3 percent or less 
since 1982 
prices are lower than overseas in such areas as photo printing 
dry cleaning and facial tissues the report said dry cleaning for 
example showed new york at 105 on a price scale where tokyo 
equaled 100 hamburg was at 147 london 138 and paris 166 
price differentials were one of many areas covered in the recent 
usjapan negotiations on structural barriers to trade japan said 
it would try to reduce price differentials where possible and the 
economic planning agency report surveyed some of the recent 
developments in that area 
it attributed some price drops in japan to market pressures that 
followed the increase in the yens value starting in 1985 that 
increase made prices in japan already high even higher when 
quoted in us dollars 
but the market mechanism does not work sufficiently if there 
are regulations that hinder competition or if there are obstacles 
in the distribution process the report said 
it said regulations should be relaxed and the antimonopoly act 
should be strictly implemented both measures were important us 
demands in the trade talks which ended in june 
yoshiro tokunaga director of the agencys price research 
divison told reporters that high utility prices were due mostly to 
high infrastructure costs and the need to build more power plants 
to cover peak electricity demands in the summer 
regarding air fares the report said in september 1988 a 
traveler in the united states britain or france buying a ticket to 
tokyo paid only 74 percent to 82 percent of the price that a ticket 
on the same route cost if bought in tokyo but early this month the 
traveler outside japan was paying 109 percent to 125 percent of the 
tokyobought fare 
the report attributed the reversal to the gradual lowering of 
yenbased air fares under market pressure and to the weakening of 
the yen from 134 to the dollar in september 1988 to 153 in early 
july the yen recently has strengthened somewhat and closed at 
14850 against the dollar on monday 
the japanese consumer suffers from high prices on imported 
goods the report said american goods sell for 30 percent to 40 
percent more in japan than in other countries and european goods 
were 30 percent to 50 percent higher than in their countries of 
origin and 20 percent higher than in the united states 
the report blamed the difference partly on foreign companies 
strategy of charging high prices because japanese consumers want 
prestige brand names at almost any cost also responsible were 
costs of adapting foreign products to japanese standards high land 
and labor costs and the practice of sole import agents imposing 
standard prices it said

the british government said monday it might sell 
the stateowned electricity generator powergen to british 
conglomerate hanson plc rather than to the public 
powergen would cost about 1 billion pounds or 182 billion 
analysts said 
powergen and the larger stateowned national power are scheduled 
to be privatized in february through the sale of shares on londons 
stock exchange as part of britains biggest privatization yet 
energy secretary john wakeham said the government was holding 
discussions with hanson the only company to approach him so far 
in a statement to the house of commons wakeham said that if 
hanson decides to make a binding offer for powergen he would 
invite other companies to place competitive bids 
lord hanson chairman of hanson confirmed his company had a 
firm interest in making a bid for powergen 
wakeham said that if a serious offer was made for national 
power he would consider its private sale as well 
hanson owns considerable coal assets including peabody holding 
co the biggest coal producer in the united states 
since many powergen power stations are situated on the coast 
with port handling facilities hanson coal could be easily 
imported analysts said 
the governments willingness to consider other options may 
indicate the feedback on the enthusiasm of the privatizations 
hasnt been what the government might have hoped said arthur 
hepher an analyst with the investment firm laing and cruickshank 
ltd 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative government has 
sold off 283 billion pounds or 52 billion dollars worth of 
stateowned companies since 1979 to promote capitalism in britain 
the sales have been largely successful the notable exception 
was the sale of the governments remaining onethird stake in 
british petroleum co plc which coincided with the october 1987 
stock market crash investors shunned the shares which were left 
in the hands of underwriters 
the government previously has privatized companies by selling 
them to one buyer 
the latest such sale of the rover car group to british 
aerospace plc in july 1988 was marred by the european commissions 
rebuke of the government for including hidden sweeteners for 
british aerospace 
the ec last month ordered millions of dollars in sweeteners 
returned to the government

the busiest month yet for the savings and loan 
bailout ballooned the federal budget deficit to 112 billion in 
june a month when corporate tax payments usually produce a 
surplus the government said monday 
the shortfall compared with a 78 billion surplus in june 
1989 brought red ink for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to 
1631 billion more than half again as much as the 1054 billion 
deficit at this time last year 
if the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace it could 
top the record fiscalyear deficit of 2211 billion set in 1986 
the white house office of management and budget is officially 
forecasting a budget gap of 2185 billion just short of the 
record 
white house negotiators and congressional leaders are attempting 
to put together a major deficitreduction pact for fiscal 1991 
starting oct 1 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president 
bush would sit down with the leaders of congress for daily hard 
bargaining sessions for the rest of the week in hopes of reaching 
an agreement 
the president wants to give it a major push fitzwater said 
pessimism about the eventual success of those talks contributed 
to the stock price tumble monday analysts said 
absent an agreement omb projects the 1991 deficit at 2314 
billion 
the deficit is totally running out of control said 
economist michael k evans who heads a washingtonbased consulting 
firm through january the deficit was apparently in good shape 
starting in february it started going bananas 
evans attributed the ballooning budget gap to sampl bailout 
spending and to sluggish economic growth which is producing 
lowerthanexpected tax revenues 
bailout spending by the governments resolution trust corp 
totaled 158 billion in june a third of its total spending 
through june of 45 billion june was the bailouts busiest month 
the rtc dealt with 83 institutions bringing its total of bailouts 
and closings to 207 
eventually the government expects to sell real estate loans 
securities and other assets inherited from failed thrifts that 
revenue should help reduce the budget deficit in future years 
the economy as measured by the gross national product grew at 
a subpar 19 percent annual rate in the januarymarch quarter and 
is projected by most economists to have grown at an even slower 16 
percent rate in the apriljune period 
as a result corporate tax collections through june were 725 
billion down 92 percent from the same period a year ago 
all revenues totaled 1106 billion in june and 7777 for the 
year to date up 38 percent from the same period a year ago 
spending totaled 1218 billion for the month and 9408 billion 
for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 up 101 percent from 1989 
the biggest spending categories as usual were the military

wall street was spooked by a sudden drop of more 
than 100 points in the dow jones industrial average today but the 
battered market recovered nearly half the lost ground by the close 
the dow average which had flirted with an alltime high finish 
of 3000 last week plunged about 107 points in the first 90 
minutes of trading by the end the average had struggled back to 
290470 down 5644 points or 19 percent 
the loss extended fridays slump of 3267 points and sent a 
disturbing signal about the health of the market and the broader 
economy 
it just scared the hell out of everyone said john eberley 
head of equity trading at the chicago corp it caught our 
attention 
it went from sell to buy to sell again just between 930 and 
11 said leigh stevens a strategist at painewebber inc its 
unusual to see such backandforth like that in such a short time 
span 
declining issues outnumbered advances by 6to1 on the new york 
stock exchange where trading was heavy and hectic 
as money was flowing out of stocks it flowed into the bond 
market during the early going but longterm treasuries finished 
slightly lower on the day as stocks recovered 
the abrupt drop in stocks also influenced the dollars value 
which declined against the west german mark and british pound but 
the dollar strengthened against the yen in japan where stock 
prices fell sharply overnight 
the severity of the stock market drop was intensified by 
computerized strategies known as program trading which can dump 
enormous amounts of shares on the market 
nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin said the nations biggest stock 
exchange had asked for a voluntary restraint on program trading 
after the dows sharp drop federal regulators also were paying 
close attention to the markets behavior 
were aware of the situation and watching it closely said 
john heine a spokesman for the securities and exchange commission 
in washington 
the swift selloff caused a brief automatic halt in the standard 
amp poors 500 stockindex futures contract an important influence 
on stock prices traded in the chicago futures markets 
the halt was triggered by a circuitbreaker mechanism put in 
place by the financial markets in the wake of the crash of oct 19 
1987 when the dow average fell a record 508 points 
brokers blamed the markets latest weakness on a number of 
causes ranging from disappointing corporate earnings reports of 
leading us companies to the uncertain outlook for interest rates 
and the economy to the abrupt fall in tokyo stock prices 
this market behavior is going to discourage people said 
chung lew head trader at kleinwort benson north america inc in 
new york 
some said investors were bothered by a report in the wall street 
journal this morning about the prospect of financial collapse for 
the largest guarantor of student loans in the country 
the account suggested the higher education assistance 
foundations 96 billion in loan guarantees may have to be 
salvaged by the federal government aggravating the problem of 
easing the federal budget deficit already overburdened by the 
enormous cost of the savings amp loan bailout 
other brokers said the dow drop was a symptom of the markets 
performance in recent days they said the average showed signs of 
weakness in the past several trading sessions as it struggled 
unsuccessfully to close above the 3000 mark 
ive been expecting a correction said lawrence helfand a 
senior strategist at rodman amp renshaw a chicago investment firm 
i wouldnt be surprised to see the market pull back 8 to 10 
percent theres lots of negative news around with no real reason 
to anticipate any positive news 
although the 3000milestone has proved elusive the dow average 
of 30 industrial stocks has posted a string of new highs during 
july peaking at 299975 at midmonth

sharply lower monday against most other major currencies in foreign 
exchange

decline and as investors sought refuge from stocks traders said 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current

stock prices of 30 of the biggest us companies plunged around 
100 points in the first 90 minutes of trading it later regained 
some ground before ending the session with a drop of around 56 
points 
waves of computerized program selling weak corporate earnings 
and concerns about broad economic factors were largely responsible 
for wall streets selloff 
all that helped spook dollar traders too 
it was kind of a psychological thing said trevor woodland 
chief coporate trader for harris trust amp co in chicago if 
youre a trader youre not going to buy a currency when the equity 
market is faring poorly 
this is particularly true among foreign traders as demand for 
equity falls so does the need to convert foreign currencies into 
dollars to buy stocks 
in tokyo where the global trading day begins the dollar closed 
at 14850 yen up 015 yen from fridays finish the dollar traded 
lower at 14840 yen in london and at 14819 yen in new york down

medical supply giant baxter international 
inc on monday reported a 6 percent increase in secondquarter 
earnings citing stronger sales and higher profit margins than in 
the second quarter of 1989 
baxter reported earnings of 110 million or 37 cents per share 
for the three months ending june 30 compared with 104 million or 
35 cents per share for the same period a year ago 
sales for the quarter totaled 2 billion an 8 percent increase 
over 19 billion for the second quarter of 1989 baxter said in a 
statement from its headquarters in deerfield a north chicago 
suburb 
baxter said its performance was even better than the bottom line 
indicates because the 1989 secondquarter results included onetime 
gains of 196 million or 7 cents per share from the sale of some 
assets 
our performance this quarter was excellent said vernon r 
loucks jr baxters chairman 
these results are consistent with our projection for at least 
a 15 percent increase in operating income for the full year 
excluding our restructuring program costs loucks said 
early in april baxter announced plans to pare its workforce of 
64300 by 10 percent and close or sell 21 of its 100 manufacturing 
plants in 24 countries 
the company made a provision of 566 million in the first 
quarter to cover the restructuring costs 
because of that charge baxter reported a net loss of 273 
million or 122 per share for the first six months of 1990 
compared with net income of 205 million or 69 cents per share 
for the same period of 1989 
sixmonth sales totaled 39 billion an 8 percent increase from 
36 billion in the first six months of last year 
baxter spokesman les jacobson said he knew of only one plant 
closed so far but he said 500 to 700 jobs had been eliminated at 
the companys headquarters and another 1000 headquarters employees 
had been transferred to the field

time warner inc said monday it lost 51 million 
in the second quarter due to costs and interest expenses related to 
times 14 billion purchase of warner communications inc 
but the company said earnings before interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization climbed to a record 536 million for 
the quarter and said four of its six business segments films 
records cable tv systems and programming had record second 
quarters 
time bought controlling interest in warner last july but did 
not complete its purchase of the rest of warners stock until 
january 
as a result time warner presented its earnings both on an 
historical basis reflecting only a prorated portion of warners 
results for 1989 and on a pro forma basis stated as if the 
companies were combined for all of 1989 
time warners loss of 329 per common share after preferred 
dividends for the three months ended june 30 contrasted with a 
profit of 92 million or 165 a share on an historical basis a 
year earlier on a pro forma basis it lost 52 million or 332 a 
share a year earlier 
revenue for the quarter amounted to 259 billion up more than 
double from 122 billion a year earlier on an historical basis but 
only up 44 percent from pro forma revenue of 248 billion 
time warner said its filmed entertainment division earned a 
secondquarter record 75 million before interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization up 23 percent from pro forma 
earnings of 61 million a year earlier 
its home video unit was a major contributor with strong 
worldwide sales of tango and cash lethal weapon ii and 
christmas vacation 
the recorded music and music publishing division earned a 
secondquarter record 125 million before interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization up from a pro forma 118 million a 
year earlier the latest results were led by strong domestic sales 
from madonna paula abdul anita baker and keith sweat

interest taxes depreciation and amortization of 188 million in 
the cable division and 46 million in programming pro forma 
results were 160 million in cable and 43 million in programming a 
year earlier 
the companys magazine division had earnings before interest 
taxes depreciation and amortization of 85 million in the second 
quarter down from 99 million on a pro forma basis a year earlier 
results were affected by a soft climate for magazine advertising 
and the anticipated startup costs at entertainment weekly launched 
in february 
its books division reported earnings before interest taxes 
depreciation and amortization of 17 million in the quarter down 
from 38 million on a pro forma basis a year earlier the decline 
was blamed on absence of profits from scott foresman and co a 
textbook publisher sold in december 1989 
for the first half time warner said it lost 102 million or 
654 per common share after preferred dividends it earned 146 
million or 254 a share on an historical basis a year earlier

products said its profit rose 218 percent in the three months

kansas city power and light co made an 
857 million tender offer for kansas gas and electric co monday a 
move kcpl officials said would cut costs for both utilities and 
delay their need to add generating capacity 
kcpl executives say they could freeze rates for all customers 
until jan 1 1993 if the merger goes through 
the offer for 27 in cash per common share would be financed 
by a 1 billion credit agreement that kcpl has signed with two 
banks westpac banking corp and the first national bank of 
chicago company officials said 
the share price offered is 37 percent more than kgampes stock 
price friday according to kcpl kgampe stock which closed at 1975 
friday closed at 2437 monday on the new york stock exchange 
while kcpls stock fell 87 cents to close at 3150 
at least 90 percent of kgampes shares must be offered the tender 
offer also requires approval of state and federal regulators kcpl 
officials said 
the only comment i can make is we have received the offer we 
will evaluate it we will respond after that evaluation is 
complete said lyle koerper a kgampe spokesman in wichita 
koerper said he did not know when the evaluation would be 
complete 
the offer is scheduled to expire at midnight aug 20 
in a letter to kgampe officials kcpls president and chief 
executive a drue jennings said the merger would make more 
complete and efficient use of kgampes generating capacity and delay 
kcpls need to add capacity 
at a news conference jennings said for several years he has 
discussed the merger idea informally with wilson cadman kgampe 
president and board chairman 
jennings described mondays tender offer as a nudge 
our companies are very good friends he said theyve done 
a lot of commercial business together over the past 25 years i 
think its a good deal i really do 
kcpl also filed a federal lawsuit monday seeking a court order 
requiring kgampe to comply with a kansas law that would require it to 
call a special shareholders meeting within 30 to 50 days the 
meeting would be to authorize kcpl to vote all of the shares it 
acquires through its tender offer 
jennings said his company proposes to expand its board of 
directors by five members to add representatives from kgampes 
service headquarters and to add a citizens advisory commission to 
represent consumers in kgampes service territory 
jennings said he was optimistic that both kgampe and regulators 
would be receptive to the offer 
i think theyll appreciate what they see he said this is 
a strategic combination that really does make sense it probably 
should have been done years ago 
kcpl has about 409000 customers in 23 counties in western 
missouri and eastern kansas including the kansas city area it has 
about 2800 employees 
kgampe serves about 254000 customers in southeastern kansas 
including the wichita area it employs about 1330 
kcpl said it plans no layoffs if the merger goes through 
the two utilities each own 47 percent of the wolf creek nuclear 
power plant in southeast kansas kansas electric power cooperatives 
inc owns the remainder 
jennings said the merger would not affect the hybrid corporation 
that runs wolf creek or the plants daytoday operations

chrysler corp will offer special 
versions of its 1991 dodge shadow and plymouth sundance cars to 
recapture market share lost when the dodge omni and plymouth 
horizon died the company said monday 
the cars will be called america versions and carry base 
prices of 7599 for a twodoor version and 7799 for the 
fourdoor model 
chrysler said the shadow and sundance america cars would be 
offered with a limited number of options each will have a drivers 
side air bag 
the omni and horizon cars versions of which chrysler also 
marketed as america models ended when the jefferson avenue 
assembly plant in detroit shut down feb 2 since then chrysler 
has effectively been out of the subcompact market 
in 1989 chrysler sold 79500 omni and horizon cars and 167288 
sundance and shadow cars 
the america versions of the shadow and sundance are seen as 
plugging a hole in chryslers lineup until the company either 
develops a new subcompact on its own or joins with an overseas 
automaker to develop such a vehicle 
there has been speculation that chrysler has been talking with 
the italian automaker fiat spa about making a subcompact based on 
the fiat tipo sold overseas chrysler and fiat officials have 
declined to confirm or deny such speculation 
chrysler officials said earlier this year that introduction of a 
new subcompact to take the place of the omni and horizon wouldnt 
take place until the mid1990s after the company introduces an 
allnew midsize car codenamed lh 
in addition to the shadow and sundance america cars chrysler 
also said that it would introduce upscale versions of the same 
vehicles and a shadow convertible prices for those cars will be 
released later

gold futures prices surged to their highest levels in two months 
monday as sharply lower stock prices a weaker dollar and signs of 
middle eastern buying fired investor interest in the metal 
on other commodity markets silver also advanced stockindex 
futures tumbled energy futures climbed livestock and meat futures 
retreated and grains and soybeans were mostly higher 
gold futures settled 770 to 780 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in august up 
770 at 36970 a troy ounce the spot july contract settled at 
36910 a troy ounce the highest settlement of a spot gold 
contract since may 22 
silver futures settled 3 cents to 34 cents higher with july at 
4882 a troy ounce 
gold opened with a surge in new york following news of a large 
purchase of gold bullion in london that analysts believe originated 
in the middle east some previous middle eastern transactions have 
been large enough to swing prices wildly leaving the market 
sensitive to signs of middle eastern interest 
shortly after the strong opening the dow jones industrial 
average plunged 107 points sending many stock investors fleeing to 
the perceived safety of the precious metals 
the stock market slowly trimmed its losses throughout the day 
but gold remained strong with new support stemming from higher oil 
prices an inflationary signal and a weaker dollar 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc 
said the federal reserve boards recent moves to lower interest 
rates have been a boon to the gold market 
it looks like some foreigners are concerned about the 
possibility that fed chairman alan greenspans stance toward 
inflation may be weakening which pulled the props out from under 
the dollar savaiko said 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities inc 
said reports of new violence in south africa surfaced shortly after 
the close which could give gold prices another boost on tuesday 
the stock markets slide prompted sympathetic selling on many 
commodity markets 
stockindex futures which sometimes shadow and sometimes lead 
the stock market also fell sharply in early trading and closed 
with smaller although still steep losses 
on the chicago mercantile exchange standard amp poors 500 
futures settled 7 points to 725 points lower with september at 
35780 the contract is valued at 500 per point 
the september contract fell 12 points early in the session 
triggering a circuit breaker trading halt designed to guard 
against a stock market collapse

reduce their crude output and raise prices opecs midyear meeting 
begins thursday

higher with september at 2050 a barrel heating oil was 71 cent

gasoline was 39 cent to 70 cent higher with august at 6335 cents 
a gallon 
livestock and meat futures fell on the chicago mercantile 
exchange led by limit losses in the porkbelly market for the 
third time in the last four sessions 
in addition to weak bacon demand and lower cash markets bellies 
were pressured by fridays monthly agriculture department cold 
storage report which showed larger stocks of frozen bellies than 
the market had expected 
live cattle settled 12 cent to 63 cent lower with august at 
7630 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 58 cent lower 
with august at 8730 cents a pound live hogs were 102 cents lower 
to 13 cent higher with august at 5970 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 167 cents to the limit 2 cents lower with july at 
4420 cents a pound 
most grain and soybean futures advanced on the chicago board of 
trade erasing most of the losses posted early in the session 
analysts said the main influence in the crop markets probably 
will continue to be bearish fundamentals that include good weather 
for corn and soybean developement 
after the close the national weather service issued a new 
sixto10day outlook predicting normal temperatures and 
abovenormal rainfall for the midwest in the first half of next 
week 
the usda released its weekly cropprogress report after the 
close showing little improvement in the corn and soybean crops 
with development well behind the norm 
the usda reported the winter wheat harvest was 83 percent 
complete as of sunday which is near the average pace

the stock market was hammered monday in a 
chilling reminder of past crashes as the dow jones industrial 
average plummeted more than 100 points before recouping about half 
of its decline 
in its biggest drop since january the dow average of 30 
industrial stocks the markets best known barometer finished 
down 5644 points at 290470 extending fridays 3267point 
decline in the broader market virtually all market indicators and 
industry groups were lower 
there was a whiff of panic in the air said jack conlon 
head of equity trading for rothschild inc clearly there was a 
good deal of damage done 
still the decline was only the third worst of 1990 the dow 
industrials tumbled 7745 points on jan 22 and 7146 on jan 12 
it left the dow average above the 2900 mark although it has 
largely retreated after coming within a whisker of 3000 last week 
declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 6 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
227 up 1430 down and 365 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 20903 million 
shares up from 17781 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 25050 million shares 
waves of computerized stock selling programs weak 
secondquarter corporate earnings reports and concerns about 
inflation and interest rates thrust stocks lower from the opening 
bell 
the new york stock exchange asked member firms voluntarily to 
restrain from program trading but the request did not appear to 
have much impact as buy and sell programs whipsawed the market 
later in the day the activity has been blamed in the past for 
contributing to big intraday price swings 
traders said the speed of the morning tumble was reminiscent of 
the 1987 market crash and the october 1989 selloff that scared away 
individual investors and helped bring on a recession in the 
securities industry 
the market lost 107 points in the first 90 minutes of trading 
before quickly recovering about 50 points it then drifted lower 
and hovered there until a spurt just before the close 
a sharp decline in two key stockindex futures which link 
trading in the stock and futures markets triggered a 
circuitbreaker in the chicago index futures market prohibiting 
the products from trading at lower levels for 30 minutes 
helping lead the drop was a weakerthanexpected earnings report 
by mcdonalds which fell 3 to 33 and was the most active nyse 
issue the report was issued too late friday for the market to 
react 
an earnings surprise in a supposedly stable stock like that is

in the economy 
kansas gas amp electric rose 4 to 24rsqb the utility said it was 
reviewing a 27 a share tender offer by kansas city power amp light 
other gainers included precious metals and trucking issues 
analysts said the markets inability to break 3000 it twice 
closed at 299975 last week added to underlying weakness 
eugene peroni technical research director for janney montgomery 
scott inc in philadelphia said after the dow hit 2000 in january 
1987 the market stalled for some time 
the fact that we were around 3000 just adds to the 
psychological woes at this point and makes it more of a mystical 
level he said 
as measured by wilshire associates index of more than 5000

northwest airlines chairman wants to oversee 
a controlled sale of eastern airlines assets and buy many of 
easterns planes and gates in atlanta according to a published 
report 
the story in mondays editions of the wall street journal said 
the proposal was expected to be made monday but eastern said it 
had received no offer from northwest to buy parts of the airline 
the newspaper reported that northwest chairman alfred a checchi 
was expected to make the proposal to eastern and its creditors the 
journal reported the plan would call for northwest to take over 
certain eastern assets including 80 of easterns newer aircraft 
airport gates in atlanta and maintenance facilities in atlanta and 
miami 
in return the story said checchi would volunteer to broker a 
controlled liquidation of easterns remaining assets for the 
benefit of creditors 
the story which cited unidentified people familiar with the 
proposal said the plan was expected to be offered today 
such a proposal could cause a split between creditors and 
easterns bankruptcy trustee an analyst said 
timothy pettee who tracks airlines for merrill lynch 
researchus said the reported deal would run against eastern 
trustee martin shugrues plans for keeping the airline together 
but it might find favor with creditors whose main concern is 
getting their money back without regard for a future for eastern 
he said 
it may come down to the creditors having to relieve mr 
shugrue of his duties pettee said in a telephone interview 
the journals story said several difficult issues would have to 
be resolved including what to do about easterns financial 
liabilities 
it noted that by some estimates easterns pension plan alone is 
underfunded by at least 500 million checchi has said he wants no 
obligations that would result in additional debt for northwest 
northwest officials declined comment monday saying they would 
not respond to speculation and rumor 
in a midafternoon release eastern said it had received no 
offer from northwest adding that a breakup of the carrier wasnt 
acceptable to shugrue 
guy cook president of the northwest airlines machinists union 
said he didnt feel that ongoing negotiations were far enough along 
for a concrete proposal cook said when he heard about the report 
he did some checking and determined that although checchi is in 
new york he is not meeting with creditors 
that confirms my belief that no deal is going to be made 
cook said 
but pettee said if a deal is made it would probably cost 
northwest about 500 million dollars 
northwest does not have debt problems they are in good 
shape he said 
helane becker an airline analyst for shearson lehman hutton 
said the reported proposal would give northwest a presence in the 
southeast with additional gates in atlanta as it strives to become 
one of the megacarriers of the 1990s 
pettee agreed saying the checchis goal is to shift its 
southeastern hub out of memphis where its losing money to 
atlanta 
by moving that plant to atlanta he might be able to make some 
money pettee said 
eastern is a unit of continental airlines holdings inc of 
houston formerly texas air corp it filed for protection from its 
creditors under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in march 
1989 and a bankruptcy judge appointed shugrue as trustee for the 
airline in april 
checchi had been a top strategist for the marriott corp hotel 
concern and the bass brothers of texas before winning a bidding war 
last year with a 365 billion leveraged buyout proposal for nwa 
the st paul minnbased parent of northwest

375000 and censured after a new york stock exchange investigation 
of trading practices by schwabs reorganization department company 
officials announced 
from january 1985 through september 1988 the department which 
processes tender and exchange offerings stock purchase rights and 
warrants and convertible redeemable securities would sometimes 
submit more securities than it had instructions from the customer 
to tender according to a company statement issued monday 
the trading practices sometimes resulted in gains for schwab 
the statement said when gains occurred schwab disbursed the 
related net credits with interest to affected customer accounts 
the nyse hearing panel found that the department had acted 
principally to avoid losses when the firm received and honored late 
customer instructions and to protect against errors in complex 
junkbond transactions according to the statement 
in addition to the fine two employees have been censured the 
company said 
we have undertaken strong internal measures to prevent such 
practices in the future including new policies governing each type 
of reorganization transaction separation of functions and a

ted turner said monday that turner broadcasting 
system inc could lose as much as 26 million on the goodwill games 
doubling earlier projections by the company 
asked if losses this summer would equal the 26 million 
shortfall from the 1986 goodwill games in moscow the tbs board 
chairman said the deficit would be in that range he declined 
to detail the reasons for the losses at the annual tbs 
shareholders meeting monday 
but turner was upbeat about the international athletic event 
that got under way friday and ends here aug 5 he said it is 
increasing world exposure for tbs and helping the atlantabased 
company market its cable news network and other services abroad 
were very happy with the way things are going in the goodwill 
games turner said after the session 
during the meeting turner was taken to task for his personal 
views by accuracy in media a conservative watchdog group 
and a shareholders proposal to place his frequent companion 
actress jane fonda on the companys board of directors died for 
lack of a second 
the companys 1989 annual report listed 266 million in total 
losses from cable network operations movie and video enterprises 
and two professional sports teams the atlanta braves baseball and 
atlanta hawks basketball clubs 
but turner told shareholders that 1989 was the best year that 
the company has ever had we cracked a billion dollars in volume 
for the first time 
he blamed the losses on costs of refinancing junk notes 
issued in conjunction with turner broadcastings purchase of mgmua 
and said tbs would be within its projected budget for fiscal 1990 
even with the goodwill losses 
turner spent most of the meeting countering jabs from accuracy 
in media and selfappointed corporate watchdog evelyn davis who 
holds stock in 120 corporations davis spends much of her time 
heckling executives at the companies annual meetings and also 
publishes a newsletter highlights and lowlights detailing her 
opinions about their operations 
she asked whether tbs was about to merge with any other 
companies and if turner was going to run for political office 
turner responded to both queries with a forceful no 
davis offered the proposal to place ms fonda on the 15member 
tbs board of directors 
she is not only a good actress but above all she is a good 
businesswoman and i think we need a good businesswoman on this 
board she said 
the motion failed 
turner had less trouble with aim which urged him to retract 
procommunist statements made on the cnn opinion program 
crossfire and to ask ms fonda to retract similarly 
characterized statements allegedly made in 1968 
turner made no apologies for his own statements though he said 
he opposes totalitarian government 
he promised he would talk to ms fonda 
aim alleged that only views shared by turner who holds 629 
percent of tbs shareholder voting power are aired in company 
programming 
among those mentioned by aim representatives included his belief 
that criminals are products of their environments that fidel 
castro is a hell of a guy and sympathy should go to those who 
pulled the triggers as well as the victims of tiananmen square 
kent state and other tragedies
